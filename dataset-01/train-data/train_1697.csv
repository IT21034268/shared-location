1,IF I could give 0 STARS I would,"This one is a total waste of plastic. I used it once a day and it lasted 7. I hate evenflo products but went against my better judgement anyway. The motor weakened by the day. IT IS LOUD!!! ALL NOISE NO WORK! I had to squeeze with the motor at the HIGHEST setting to get just a little.I would get about a total of 4-5oz after 30-45 min. When I called the company(which has the worst hours), they just sent me a bag of parts and said you figure it out. It took 2 wks for them to arrive. Parts made no difference. First they said no return. I said like hell you wont. Then they said only half the MSRP with me paying shipping. I still have the damn thing. Not even worth going to the PO for half the price minus shipping. I ended up with a free brand new medela hand pump from WIC(if I had only asked from the get go). With that one, I got a total of 10oz in 5-10 min. Next time around, I will fork out the money for the electric medelas. Cost more but they know what they are making."
1,Not worth it.,"This is my second evenflo pump. You would think i learned the first time. The inlet where the cord plugs into broke, and it doesnt work with batteries. It lasted three weeks. Also, the milk gets sucked into the motor very easily. Your better off spending the money on a really good one. This isnt for the serious pumper!"
2,It works for a few months then dies,I bought this pump december 12th 2005 after my 3 day old wouldn't latch on. Well I used it everyday every 2-3 hours and it worked great! I could pump about 3 oz each breast then it grew to 5 oz but the milk would get caugt in the tube all the time. First the cord started messing up. I had to twist it around for it to turn on and stay on. So I tried with batteries to give the cord a rest but the batteries didn't work. Then the cord stopped working altogether. Finally I got the batteries to work and for 2 weeks. Then one day while I was at work the suction just went from great to poor. I could only pump 2 oz then it went down to 1 1/2oz. Please spend a little more money for a better quality more expensive pump that will last longer. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who plans on breastfeeding for more than 3 months. I guess it is ok if its just for an occasional pump.
2,Only worked for a while,"I've only been using this pump for about 3 months now for pumping at work. It seemed to work okay at first as I tried to get the hang of how to use it being a first time mom. As time went by, the unit would make a weird noise and the suction was noticeably affected. I would have to turn off the unit, detach the plastic piece and then reattach and start the process all over again. By this time, the frustration in getting the thing to sound and suck right again and trying to pinpoint what was wrong, made my let down reflex go away. This product is a waste of time, money and a good attitude about pumping. I'm giving a manual pump a shot, by a different brand and with higher ratings."
1,The Worst Ever,Don't be fooled by the price. This pump is horrible. It lost a great deal of suction. It is heavy and loud. Milk flows through the tubing that milk should not even touch. All around waste of money. If you want a good pump get a Lanisoh. I have had no issues with it and can pump for 15-20 min and fill up my bottles and is much more quieter.
2,Broken in 6 months- No replacement parts available,"Unless you only intend to pump for a short period of time and only occasionally, I would not recommend this pump for the following reasons:1. It's noisy. If you live in an apartment and try to pump while the baby is asleep, you might wake it up.2. If you lean back into a relaxed position while using it, the milk will not drain into the bottle, and may drip down the front of you.3. I was not able to get a replacement part when mine cracked. It cracked because I was using an Evenflo glass bottle with it instead of the plastic bottle it comes with.4. The Lansinoh pump I bought to replace it works much better with the Evenflo glass bottles than this Evenflo pump.5. It takes a looong time to pump, especially because you have to do one side at a time with this model."
4,works,I have used this with my first daughter and am still using it with my second. it works. You need to make sure to wet the edge of the cup for the suction to work.
2,NEXT Please,This electric BP is not very good quality. I have an Avent manual pump which works much better. The suction is very poor and takes just as long if not longer than a manual pump.
2,Waste of money!,The pump did not supply enough suction battery or electric wise. I found myself doing all the work anyway.
3,It's good for occassional use,"This pump is good if you have patience. First, people complain about the suction not working: the plastic piece has to be put in the hole/slot just right for it to work. You may have to rotate/turn it some to get a good suction. Second, people complain that this pump is painful: you have to make sure your nipple is lined up just right, or yes it does hurt. Third, I have read that the pump holds liquid in the neck - this is caused by poor suction or clogged holes. I only use my pump 2-3 times a week. I used it more when I first brought my son home. At 3 weeks premature he had problems w/ latching on, and let me say that is more painful then this pump could ever be. This product is not for people exclusively pumping - it wasn't designed for that. It will wear out sooner. I think it is good for people who are on a tight budget and using it 3-4 times a week, or for problems with poor latch on/ delayed milk."
1,HORRIBLE,"I purchased this pump when my first child was born 2 years ago. I was able to nurse for very long which was good because the pump died on me about 2 months later. After my second child was born 8 weeks ago, I was in need of a new pump. I gave it another try hoping the first one was simply a bad unit.I was wrong! This unit again lost all suction after 8 weeks. At 5 am when needed most. I did some research and foudn that if you wet the pieces it will work again. which it did but the suction was so low (on max) it barely did the job. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! Even when it is working it has to be on maximum, the low settings are way too low. And it is loud! If you are pregant plan on spending good money to get a good pump, this one is tempting because of the price but its not worth the hassle or the engorged breasts at 5 am when it breaks down."
1,Pass this one up,"This breastpump works pretty well at first, however, after using it everyday for 4 wks, it took a pooh on me. I used the plug-in cord, cleaned it after every use, and used the proper parts NOT washed in the dishwasher and it just stopped working one day. We tried replacing the batteries, etc. but nothing worked. I would not recommend this product because it lacks durability. I also agree with other reviewers who stated that it is quite painful to pump with this model. The sound that this pump makes is also really, really annoying. I stopped pumping 4 months ago and can still hear the buzz of it. Overall, pass this one up. Spend the money on a quality electric pump if you can."
1,CAUTION- THIS PUMP IS DANGEROUS,"I bought this pump shortly before returning to work because I travel a lot during the day and it is very portable. When I returned my hospital pump my lacatation specialist told me that Evenflo breast pumps can cause serious tissue damage. DO NOT USE THIS PRODCUT!! I have contact Evenflo to get my money back, you should do the same. The Avent Isis is only a few dollars more and much safer to use."
1,This product is awful,I received this pump as a gift. The first time I used it I got a few ounces from my breasts. After the first use however it was like it lost power and wouldn't hardly suction anything. I would only get about an ounce each time after that. I know there was more I could feel that my breasts had more milk. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy.
1,Not worth the cost!!!,"I bought 2 of these pumps because they were out of the double pump. One pump went out in less then 30 days, so I bought another one. When it worked it worked great. About a week after I bought the 3rd pump the other one went out. I did not have the receipts from those 1st 2 but I called evenflo anyway. They were wonderful they sent me 2 replacement hand pieces no questions asked. When they arrived neither of them worked on high only on low...and I need high. Don't buy...find something else!"
2,Piece of junk,"This pump only lasted about a month... I only pump about once a day, and although it worked great for a while, it didn't last. The motor suddenly began sputtering and eventually the suction gave out... Nothing I did could fix the problem. Evenflo does not give a whole lot of troubleshooting suggestions. The problem could of been milk in the motor, but the design is so that this is difficult to avoid. I would advise anyone to just spend the extra money in a better pump with better customer support. This one went in the trash."
1,Too slow,"It was way to slow. In an hour it got about 2 oz of milk out, but after that it did not get any more milk out because it wasn't powerful enough to do so. I do not recommend this pump."
1,Not a good Pump - BEWARE!!!,"My friend had recommended me to pump this pump on my registry and I got it as a gift, I thought I was all set for a pump. Good thing I had rented a hospital grade pump, so I relied on that for expressing milk. <br />My baby wasn't latching on since he was early, so I pumped his milk. I used this pump when we went to my in laws, so yes it was good for occasional use, I think I used it four times and the milk started to get to stuck in the valve and it vibrates! If you don't mind that, then you should get it for occasion use; I ended up getting a manual pump; which is the same price, should have just put that on my registry instead! And I use that on occasional use, in fact I can use it as my husband is driving! Thank goodness for tinted windows!"
1,Waste of money,"I bought this pump hoping that it would be efficient when I returned to work. However, this is not the case. I was able to express 4 oz three times a day for the first 4 days before the thing broke. My husband and I were forced to buy another one, only to find that the one we found didn't work. It was the same pump too. You aren't able to return these things to the store, you have to return them to the company. I would definately NOT recommend this product to anyone."
1,Don't waste your money!,Yet another unhappy customer whose pump quit working after five months of little use. Don't waste your money on this junk!
1,high hopes... dashed,"I was so happy to have this when I came home from the hospital and my milk had not come in yet, it helped out a lot. After a few months it started to break down, and by the time I purchased a new one, plus a hand pump, I might as well have purchased a more expensive one."
3,Good for occasional use,"I have been using this pump for 4 months now for &quot;special occasions&quot;. I use it about 3 times per week. I had to use the special insert so that it would fit my breast, but after that it really worked well. The major downfall of this product is that the milk will often gather at the end of the pump and get backed up. I have had to turn the pump off while pumping and shake it or manually release the milk into the bottle. Having to do this is a pain and has gotten milk all over the place. This was even with washing it in very hot, soapy water after every use. If I had gone back to work, I definitely would have tried another pump. For the money and how often I use it, I think it is fine."
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this pump thinking that I wouldn't be pumping very often and that the price was right. The price would be right if it weren't for the fact that I actually wanted to use the pump. The suction isn't good, it's loud, I can't get much from it (I can feel that I'm still full when it ""done""), and the milk gets stuck in the shaft. It is a pain (literally) to use and I am getting ready to buy a Medela pump. You get what you pay for! I would not recommend this pump!"
1,This book sucks.,"I can barely use the word ""book"" when describing this piece of trash. i do not see the parallelism that is between nature and thy self. Therefore this book is poorly written in terms of describing all of nature's qualities of life. I found it to be extremely dull and quite wordy like a stephen King novel. Therefore I highly do not recommend this book to any who is literate."
1,Very disappointing,"Much thinner and cheaper metal than I thought Revereware would ever produce. I'm very surprised and disappointed in how cheap and poorly it is made. Very thin bottom and thin coating of copper that doesn't even completely cover the stainless steel. The lid didn't fit because the pot was out of round, but I could squeeze the pot back into shape - now that's thin metal! Also handles didn't appear to be centered correctly, wish I hadn't bought it, but too expensive to return just because I didn't like it."
1,Disappointment deluxe!,"I've owned Revere Ware for over 30 years and love cooking with it. But I do not recommend this new, feather weight verson of cookware. A disclaimer with this pot stated ""do not use high heat"". What? Who wants to wait forever to bring a large pot of sauce to a boil? Following the warning - I did NOT use high heat and still ended up (after 1 use) with a stockpot bottom that flexes (pops) in and out when picked up from the cooktop to the counter. Disclaimer also states - discontinue use if bottom should separate. A Revere Ware warranty rep is sending a replacement (still waiting for it 17 days later). Meanwhile, purchased same size but older model RW stockpot with black handles on e-bay. Old pot weighs 3.4 lbs whereas the new model weighs 2 lbs. I'll definitely stay with the older cookware."
1,poor quality!,"Bought this to go with my revereware purchased about 8 years ago. I'm so disappointed with the new pot! MUCH lower quality than my old set, and the pot is so flimsy, even cooking at the lowest temps scorch the bottom of the pan. Don't waste your money..."
1,Cheaply made and flimsy,"I bought this recently. I have a 12 quart stock pot from the mid 1990's made in USA. That is very heavy duty. This 8qt one is made in Indonesia, I believe. And it is very flimsy. The bottom is not flat at all. The quality is very poor. I don't think it would have lasted a few months. Needless to say, I returned it, as the bottom wasn't even able to fit on the stove. I thought I would take a chance and get it even though it had poor reviews. I should have listened to all those reviews! Save yourself the aggravation, and don't buy it!"
2,Flimsy,"I own some Revereware that was made in the 70's and it feels like a tank compared to this thing. the handles are rolled sheet metal and feel like they can barely hold the weight of the pot, let alone two gallons of water. It hasn't broken yet, but it""s only a matter of time. It's a shame to see a previously good company put out junk like this."
2,Not the Revere of yesteryear,"I bought this 8 qt soup pot to add larger capacity to a Revere set I bought in 1991. The quality of this brand's product of 1991 and now is like night and day. My Revere ware of yesteryear was a robust heavy-weight stainless steel. Pots and pans of circa 1991 are 2-3X the thickness of this soup pot. The handles are spot welded steel instead of insulated handles mounted with a heavy phillips screw. The pot is stainless steel and it does have a copper bottom, but that is all that this pot has in common with Revere's product of 1991. Box states made in Indonesia."
1,Ignore the star rating. Amazon can't seem to acquire and ship this item.,If you would like this item to actually arrive then get it somewhere else. I've been waiting since late January.
5,Excellent clinical guide,"This concise, well written guide to prescribing mental health medication is as helpful to me, a Family Nurse Practitioner who works in a low-income community health center, as it would be to a specialist working in private practice. All medical professionals are encountering more patients with mental health diagnoses and many of them require pharmacotherapy. I found this book to be very helpful in my primary care practice and encourage my colleagues and other prescribers to purchase it for their own reference collections."
3,"Good, but Hardly Definitive","Like most notable cellists today (including Clemens Hagen, Natalie Clein, Jan Vogler, Christian Poltéra, and Torleif Thedéen - whose suites I easily prefer to these), Truls Mork studied his art with Heinrich Schiff. The master's influence is evident in Mork's performance: his tone is pure and strong, without ever becoming too big or romantic for the music at hand. Dynamics and phrasing tend to follow the same pattern in both recordings. Absent from these suites, however, are the little adrenaline surges which so poignantly charge Schiff's recording.For me, Mork's suites are simply not exciting. Great fans of the cello suites should give this set a listen. However, excellent versions by Bylsma, Thedéen, Fornier, and Schiff supplant this one as a first choice. 3.5 / 5"
5,"Pioneer Rev Series 6x9""","These are probably the best 6x9s ever made, period! they handle tremendous amounts of bass without much distortion, and the high/vocals are strong and accurate. I wish Pionner would bring this exact series back!"
4,Good CD,"I bought this in Nassau, looking for some authentic Bahamas music. It has several very good songs but some not so good. I just play the ones I like when I need that island feel."
1,Grossly inaccurate,"The book is not even entertaining, and the author has his facts so badly mixed up, you wonder if he ever researched any of the stuff he writes. And yes, Jeff Buckley was NOT a suicide. I find the spreading of this kind of misinformation offensive and disrespectful."
1,Interesting? More like INACCURATE!,"I think that the author of this book should've gotten the facts straight before releasing this! Singer/Songwriter Jeff Buckley is listed in the book as a suicide, and that is 150% INACCURATE! Jeff's death was a terrible and tragic accident and for him to be so disrespected like this, it makes me sick!(I would've given this book NO STARS, but I cannot post apparently without giving it at least 1 star)"
3,Factual Error,"I found the book interesting, but I found it hard to take any of the information listed in the book as fact. The author erronously cites Victor Hugo as penning The Three Musketeers when it was in fact Alexandre Dumas. With a glaring error such as that, what else could be miscredit as fact that I am unaware of? I did enjoy the book, but only as a piece of interesting fiction."
2,Just OK,"Some interesting facts, but a lot of them are about historical figures before the 1700's and in Europe. Be up on your world history for many of them to be worthwhile"
5,Awesome trivia,I read this along withWhore Stories: A Revealing History of the World's Oldest Professionand didn't leave the bathroom for two weeks. Most disturbing and gut-busting two weeks of my life.
3,Good for storing regular sizes of wrapping paper,"I was disappointed to find I could not store taller rolls of wrapping paper in this holder. It is attractive and sturdy. I like the soft sides as this means I can gently squeeze it into a space if needed - unlike the plastic varieties.The cutter is more bother than it is worth so, all-in-all, this is a good storage container for rolls of wrapping paper - end of story.I gave it three stars because it is well made and does serve part of its purpose."
4,holds a young Great Pyrenees.,"I put this up for my mother's Great Pyrenees.He is almost 1 year old and about 110lbs of puppy.It has been up for over two weeks now. I put it up a little lose and gave him a week to stretch it.He did stretch it about 2 feet, then, I tightened it up.Still holding and works good."
5,Great,This is a great product at a wonderful value. You receive everything you need to contain your dog and plenty of room to run.
2,Pretty Solid,Plastic wheel and the line coating came melted in a spot. Pretty nice though works great and is holding down my 60lb husky just fine.Edit: I am changing my review due to an incident Yesterday. the small cable that hooks to the dog broke. My husky is currently missing and has been since I got home from work yesterday. I spent 4 hours looking for him and will spend more time after work today. I hope we find him and he isn't hurt.
4,Price and Performance Met My Expectations.,This zip line/dog run works very well. Set up was easy with our layout. The length is great 100ft is awesome! I attached two leads to the main line to give my dog extra freedom. She runs and plays ball goes into the woods to relieve herself. It's everything I wanted. If I get a year out of it I'll be happy.
3,"Good, but probably could be better.","With this antenna, hi definition channels look really good. I disagree with the other reviews where they say that it works better without being plugged in. When I unplug it, my signal immediately dies. Another problem I found is that sometimes when I walk by the antenna, the picture on the tv can skip, this also happens on windy days. Also, the unit doesnt come with any instructions, which was disappointing. If you do buy this antenna, you have to run the ""Channel search"" feature on your TV or else you will get NOTHING, I was forced to figure that out by myself. For $15 with free shipping, this has been a worthy purchase."
2,Worse than its own model,"I purchased RCA ANT301 to replace the old one, also RCA, bought 5 years ago, that has one of the rods broken.However, the new one is worse than the old one, even with a broken wing.The screen becomes blurer with many flies flying all over.I have to replace it with the old and broken one.I do not know which of RCAs is worth buying, for the old one is now obsolete."
2,"Good UHF reception, horrible VHF reception","I am about forty miles from the broadcast towers. The ANT301's UHF reception was very good but VHF reception is poor. It picked up one of the five VHF channels in the area. I disconnected the power and there was no difference in signal strength so it is no more ""amplified"" than a normal pair of rabbit ears. If you are looking for an inexpensive amplified antenna, the RCA ANT1250 is a better choice."
4,Great Value,"I was trying to get local HD channels added to my dish network setup. I tried a directional NONamplified antenna and after 30 minutes of fiddling for the best angle, these are the signal strength numbers I got:Fox - 68%CBS - 63%ABC - 59%Fox was the only one that was watchable at this strength. I bought the ANT301 and plugged it in and after about 5 minutes of fiddling, here are the new strengths:Fox - 78%CBS - 83%ABC - 73%All three channels are watchable now with no issues. I would recommend this antenna if you are just within range of your HD channels and want to get a better signal. It wont work miracles, but it does improve the signal over nonamplified antennas."
2,Over-Priced,"I bought this to improve the reception of the ANT110, a much cheaper model that had good reception overall but I wanted much more. I spent $30 for the ANT301 and overall it was not worth the cost. I plugged in the amplifier and it actually made things WORSE. But when I removed the amplifier I got much better reception, but the $20 ANT103 is the same thing with no amplifier so it has similar reception. If your looking for great reception go with Trek's version but if you are looking for decent reception go with the ANT103. For this, avoid it, it's overpriced and the amplifier is worse than a push-pin."
1,Because there is no zero stars,"I was putting this together when the antenna just broke off. They have the antennas swivel heads on so tight that they easily just snap off. This also has a huge clumsy AC plug which is unnecessary and a waste of precious plug space. When I returned this to the store, I saw another person retuning this exact same model also. GE has a much better model that I bought instead that doesn't break and doesn't have any AC plug which works wonderfully. Don't waste your money on this RCA antenna. I give it ZERO stars."
1,Waste of money,"I got this antenna when I bought the digital box converter thing. At first I thought I lived in an area of bad reception. I could only get 2 watchable channels and 2 with really bad reception. So for 4 months I had my antenna connected directly to my tv, getting regular analog signal. After reading the reviews (which are better) of the passive rca antenna that's basically this one but withouth the amplifier, I decided to connect it back to the digital converter without plugging the antenna into the power. To my surprise I am know getting 20 perfectly clear channels. Cannot believe but it is true. Go for the unamplified rca antenna which is cheaper."
1,RCA ANT 301 Stinks,"It actually made my reception worse. The amplifier in the back distorted my picture to the point where I saw nothing but snow. Who actually wants to put 39 inch antentta's in their house? I know I don't want to look at them. Espeicially since they didn't even make my signal come in any better. This is funny though...having the co-axel cable just hanging out by the window not only was more attactive than the 39inch flag poles, but gave me much better reception. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,"Geez, Why did I buy this junk?","Purely, all-around, awful performance. This RCA antenna looks like it is supposed to do something -- metal poles, ring that goes around in circles, wire jack, electric plug & little dial on the back.... But any spare piece of wire stuck into your TV's antenna jack will do a significantly better job than this horrible rip-off. I'm embarrassed to say that I bought it in good faith from a Big Box store. It shouldn't be for sale anywhere. Boo hoo, my poor dollars went pay for this swiveling piece of crapolla. What's the point of plugging it in and turning some little ""gain"" knob when all it does is makes the picture WORSE than if you had no antenna at all. I can't say enough about how terrible this is, and how ashamed I think RCA should feel for pushing this on distributors. I will not buy anything made by RCA in good faith again because of this stupid product."
3,the one that works is great,"Unfortunately only one of the two was functional. They are also difficult to install without damaging them as the fit is so tight, the plastic easily mangled and the electronics rather exposed. Removing them has me flummoxed so far.But, I like the one that works very much. Every other rear light I've had either gets lost, is stolen or breaks w/in a year.If there's a version 2 I'll likely buy it and hope they've spend the extra $1 it would take to make it a little higher quality."
2,"Two stars only for the cool idea, otherwise it's garbage.","When it works it was a great idea. But of course, one of the lights that functions as an on/off switch stopped working in under 10 uses. Chinese made crap."
2,Awesome... until you have to change the batteries,"I purchased a pair of these a couple of years ago, and they were awesome. Super, super bright, reliable, easy install. But when I had to change the batteries, I noticed that a misalignment between the battery holders and the side access holes meant that the battery furthest from the LED was impossible to remove without damaging the unit."
5,revere pot,it was a gift- she loved it-her old pan was damaged and this one was a great replacement for her
4,Only one problem,"The 2-quart Revere covered saucepan came in good time and in good shape. It works well and is the same as my other new Revere ware except for the fact that the inside bottom of the pan lost its shine after one use. I did not overcook anything or have any food or burning on the bottom after this initial use, and I did not clean it with any abrasives. However, the inside bottom surface now has a lack of sheen and sort of a filmy look to it that does not come off even with stainless steel cleaner."
3,Likes to rock,"Although I like the lightness of Revere saucepans, I always wonder why they like to rock. Is it because of my smooth-surface electric stove? Whatever - if you can get used to the wobbling it does have its advantages; fast heat conduction, light-weight and easy to clean."
3,Revere Ware 2-Quart Covered Saucepan,"This pan is not as heavy & sturdy as the old original Revere Ware.It was also made in Indonesia as opposed to the old pans, which were made in the USA.Nevertheless, I have kept it & am using it, as I hate to mail things back & I needed a new pan right away."
5,Love Revere Ware,"I knew the minute I decided to go all Staianless Steel, that I had to check out the Revere Ware. Why? because I used Revere Ware for many many years and I I already knew I loved it. I would have to get back to cooking on lower temps like before, but that's even better, lower electric bills.I've used all the new Revere Ware I have purchased in the past 6 months, and all of it has worked perfectly.Between my new, and my old Revere Ware, (that I pulled from my attic,) I now have tons of pots and pans that will last me almost forever.Just be sure when to start your cooking at a low temp. and take it from there. You will enjoy using Revere, it does a great job."
2,Act of Vengeance DVD,Movie was good quality. It was nice seeing the girls kick ass on the bad guy. A spoiler for me was I recognized the voice of the bad guy so I immediately knew whodunit.
2,"Women putting men in their place,ouch! That's gotta hurt.","What a disappointment this turned out to be.I remember seeing this when it first came out,liked it then not now.Could have had a better ending,i got mine through WB.Movie was pretty much predictable in a lot of places.Jack seriously had a major problem that's for sure.He should have said to his victim's sing ""Jingle Balls"" not bells.No trailer or extras of any kind,is a DvdR,silent-menu,90m.There again if you like movies about psychotic people then i would recommend this.Otherwise i'd stay clear."
5,Excellent Book on Genetic Programming,"Genetic Programming is an exciting field, and as the desktop computers become more powerful, more applications are occuring. This book prepares both the practitioner and researcher for this field. It covers much material that is needed not only to deploy GP, but to explain it to management and customers. The book also comes with the web address for sample demonstration software that I found easy to learn, and deploy on a project that had previously been analyzed via neural networks.I recommend this book highly, as well as works by Dr. Koza and Dr. Bentley for anyone interested in working in this field."
4,These recipes really impressed my Oaxacan husband !,"Many practical recipes can be found in this book and they are good for. Probably the best part of the book is the Basics of Oaxacan Cooking, including an explanation of different chiles and techniques. My favorite recipe is ""Gallina en Tesmole"". The yellow and green mole recipes are also excellent. I have impressed many Oaxaquenos with recipes from this book, and I am just learning to cook Mexican-style. Highly recommended!"
3,In Depth Cooking,"I enjoy reading cookbooks and I love the food and cultures of Mexico, so I was very excited to purchase this book. A bit disappointed to find the narrative so dry and somewhat dull, but the recipes are rich and exciting. I have cooked with some of this author's recipes before, and know they have great depth of flavor and subtle nuances. I am really looking forward to trying these as they all sound wonderful."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Up to Lammle's Previous Standard","I also passed the CCDA using this book as a review, but I relied heavily on 8 years of experience in networking. I do not recommend using only this book to study for this test. This book was not nearly as well written as Lammle's ""CCNA Exam Notes"" (note that Akin, not Lammle, is given top billing on this one). The book has too many typos to count, and in a few cases it misses the mark on technical accuracy. . .which is unacceptable for a book of this type! Overall, however, I have to grudgingly give the book three stars as an acceptable review text."
2,I passed - but BARELY.,"1/3 of my exam included questions about advanced technologies that are either not mentioned or barely discussed in this book. Nothing in this book prepares you for the structure of the test either - particularly for the case study questions. I give it 2 stars because it, along with my CCNA and a couple of years experience, helped me pass the test. However, if I had it to do over, I would have gotten Cisco's DCN book - and a more respectable passing score."
2,Poor Choice for CCDA Candidates,"This book, while neither poorly written nor inaccurate, does not suffice. It should in no way be confused with a book that helps a CCDA candidate during his or her final review. The content in this text simply does not map to the CCDA exam. Choose a Cisco Press title instead. Enough said."
2,Not up to standard yet,"I have read a lot of certification books in the past and I have to say that this does not quite do the job. The book falls short on informing you correctly about the Cisco product line (left out a lot of products) and you will miss a lot of the paperwork and planning questions on the CCDA test. I found the book to be an easy read, but it is not up to the standard that I have found with other Lammel books. I also did not like, not having the free PDA flash card software that was in Lammel's CCNA book. All and all, this book will inform you, but you will still need greater detail into Cisco product placement, Cisco's planning model and Cisco's paperwork processes."
2,Not Recommended for CCDA,"I do not recommend this text for CCDA. For the test, Cisco Press offers two very fine texts: Designing Cisco Networks and Top Down Network Design. The latter is a destined to become a classic. Let me say that, while this book is neither poorly written nor terribly inaccurate, the content doesn't relate well to what is actually on the exam. It is that simple. If you use this book during your review, you may be very disappointed during testing."
2,Get a Cisco Press help,"You sure need ""CCDA Exam Certification Guide"" or ""Designing Cisco Network"" with this book. CCDA exam is tougher than CCNA. This title doesn't give you enough knowledge you need to tackle. You need more broad networking knowledge."
1,Not good,"This book does not have the neccessary information for someone to pass the CCDA. If someone is not familiar with general networking design guidelines, than this book is a adequate source to start with. If one wants to get a good score, it is very important to have a very broad knowledge of many networking technologies. I did pass the CCDA, but it was not because of any information in this book."
1,Isn't very funny.,"Yeah, no.Nuts will not eat away at your lifespan with acids, evil and poison. I don't know what the motivation is behind this crock, but you can find so-called ""poisons"" in any human-consumed food. Isolating random chemicals in nuts and describing their toxic effects on the human body in gruesome detail is a transparent tactic whose aim is to make you shiver so much in your boots that you are too distracted to notice logical fallacies. Again, I can't fathom the reason behind this.Maybe this book is intended to be humorous."
5,You Never Forget Your First Time,"Yep, the first time those seemingly random sqiggles of color in Magic Eye leap into formation and you're staring down at an object under all that chaotic visual mess...it's a magic moment for sure. These books are a lot of fun and worth the effort it takes to get the knack of how to do it. It took me a few tries before I saw anything here, so if at first you don't succeed, stay with it because it's worth it."
4,3D Books Never Get Old,"I bought this book because I wanted to show someone the Magic Eye pictures. They had never seen anything like them before and couldn't get it. There weren't any at the nearby bookstores so I looked on Amazon and found the original for a cheap price. I was initially somewhat disappointed because the pictures weren't as complex as I remembered, but I soon realized that it started out very simple and got more and more complicated. It's good for beginners, which is who this was for. When I received it I immediately ""read"" the whole book before I gave it away. Part of the book cover was a little bent in transport. Disappointing, but overall not a big deal. I'm glad I made the purchase."
3,Just Fun,I got this just for fun. I leave it on my coffee table and when my kids come over they like to pick it up and look at it. So do I.
5,Good One !!,I really love these books. I am fascinated by the technique used to get the 3-d affect..Thanks
5,magic eye book,The book came very fast. It was very well wraped for shipping. The seller kept in contact by letting me know when it had shipped and how to best open the packaging so as not to harm the book. We really enjoy the book.
4,It will provide you with hours of useful staring,"Images with an embedded three-dimensional image fascinate me. For a long time, I was unable to discern the interior image, but when I was finally able to do so, I was hooked. This collection of 22 images kept me busy for several hours as I went stared at each page until the image appeared. When you look at these pages from a distance, the colors appear to be ordered, but not structured. It is only when you look at it the right way that the true image appears. If you enjoy figures with embedded three-dimensional images, then this is a book that you will appreciate."
5,The Fellowship of Reason,"I borrowed this book from a friend who belongs to the Fellowship of Reason Club. I like it so much I am going to buy a copy for myself. The author stresses the importance of friendship in becoming a happy person. You learn how to find the kind of friends and how to be the kind of friend you want to have for yourself.I won't join the Fellowship of Reason Club because I practice my religion and am happy in my own church group. For people who don't belong to a church, this book tells you how get people involved with each other except there is no creed to sign on to.Members are encouraged to talk about any subject and express even outrageous opinions as part of the testing process to seehow well the ideas stack up under the criticism of friends the members trust."
4,Cute Girls Naked,"I like this DVD because the girls are really cute, but not super beautiful like a barbie doll or typical centerfold. The girls are reminescent of girls you see in real life not in just magazines, so they are truly girls next door. All the girls are young and look to have real breasts. Getting to see these types of girls naked is new, since Playboy centerfolds all look the same."
4,A ROAD WELL TRAVELED BY FEW,"I note one reader called this book ""shallow."" I feel that is not true at all. This is a story of a person who gives their all in most of their endeavors and wins every time. A person who seizes each opportunity and does the best that could be expected and with all the success through many years, she is well rooted within her family and loving husband. I don't think you can do better than that.This is an excellent book describing what it takes to make a goal of being the best in the world at what sport you do. Total dedication and untold hours of practice to achieve her goal and then to improve her life much more after the gold medal.She did it right and I believe this is a good primer for the person who wants to improve themselves. Pay attention to the detail that Peggy Fleming went through and try to do it yourself.I think this is a very good book!"
1,Fleming's lack of depth is disappointing,"Fleming's autobiography, The Long Program, does a poor and inadequate job of telling a potentially profound story. Fleming's words and descriptions do not give justice to the depth of many of the stories told throughout the novel. Tragedies such as the unexpected death of her coach in a plane crash, and the deaths of her parents are stated in a sentence or two, never getting into the emotions that surely surrounded the experiences. Readers looking for a first-hand recount of Fleming's experience with competitive skating should also beware. She just barely skims the surface of the pressures and glory of being an Olympic medal winner and World Championship title holder. Humorous and detailed stories that often liven up autobiographies are also few and far between. Due to the shallowness and straightforwardness of this book, I would not recommend it for anything higher than purely recreational reading when a few hours can be spared."
3,Insightful But Not Fascinating,When I first started reading this novel. I wasn't keen about reading it because The book seemed to be like A How to Skate book. Who is her favorite skaters and me this and me that. Until I read the chapter about Being Mom and the chapter about her fighting breast cancer. Those chapters were truly inspirational. Then I felt I knew the Real Peggy Fleming. So I'm giving it three stars.
2,Disappointing and surprisingly shallow,"I admire and respect Peggy Fleming's skating talent and her commentary with Dick Button is legendary in the sport. However, this book was surprisingly disappointing. It is very disjointed and she basically spends too much time telling us how wonderful, determined, graceful and talented she is rather than showing us examples and stories in her life and letting us draw that conclusion for ourselves. I have no doubt she is all of those things, but the ego that is displayed in this self-serving book is unprecidented in any of many biographies I have ever read. There were a few humourous stories, and her dedication to skating and her family is obvious and admirable. The number of times she tells us how great she is overshadows her efforts to be top notch in whatever she does. If you can check this one out from the library and have a long plane trip to read it on, go ahead. Otherwise, to over use an analogy, there are many better ways to spend your ""Long Program."""
2,"Peggy Fleming ""The Long Program""","Too bland. While Peggy Fleming's skating style will always be my favorite, reading this book felt like an entertainer who never really connected with the audience.The book attempts to cover a smattering of events in the author's life but it was too superficial to hold my interest. Here's two examples:-- Peggy alludes to her mother's domineering personality and provides the example of taking control her wedding, but doesn't get into any of the details or how this made her feel.-- Peggy also mentions a favorite marinated pork recipe that she enjoys making for her family, and it would've seemed fitting that the recipe be included but it wasn't.I'm not sure what the focus or the purpose of this book was/is. Is it Peggy's philosphy? An instruction book? Her life story? I think if the author just focused on one of these things, it would've been more successful in both quality and sales."
3,what a lady,"Well this book reflects what we see about Ms. Fleming in her television commentary - she is a lady in the true sense of the word. But if you're looking for an inside look at the politics of figure skating, keep looking. This is Peggy's personal story - there no juicy gossip (which says a lot about her as a person but would have made the book more interesting) - what I love the most is that she includes a copy of her choreography diagram for her 1968 figure skating program - It's interesting to see how they ""write"" out a figure skating program"
1,This book just [stinks],"One word: [Stinks]. This book belongs in the sewer outside your local grocery store. Seriously. Blue Spiccoli is about the stupidest character in the world, and has about the stupidest name in the world. This book did NOT make sense at all, and Blue is just a surfer dude using incorrect language in about every sentence. But, if you are insanely weird and would like to read it, check the sewer near your local grocery store. If it's not there (I don't know why it wouldn't be), check it out from your library, because this book is definitely not worth your money."
1,Stay away for Polaroid,"I purchased this TV online. When I called to arrange for service I was given a total run around. Finally convinced them that TV was defective. Had to FAX receipt (which they lost second page). Never got a call back. Claim someone answered my phone and said there was no one living there by that name - never tried a second call to make sure they dialed correcty. Third call, I was told unit is not covered by warranty as it might be a refurbed unit.Manual is horrible - tech service is worse.Stay as far away from Polaroid as possible!"
5,smart,"it's literally not worth growing anything without this insecticide. a little goes a long way, and be careful around cats in particular, but if you have bugs nesting in your grow room, this will fix it."
4,Pretty rare,This is fairly rare since I could'nt find him anywhere in any movie package. I orderd it yesterday it should be here soon I can't wait. Though I wonder if it looks like him.
4,Does the Job,"This is simply a standard curved section of Lionel track most of us remember from our childhoods. It is ""O-gauge"" which is the standard Lionel gauge. The 27 means that used with other O-27 curved sections, it could make a circle 27"" in diameter, or part of an oval track 27"" wide. That's actually a fairly tight curve---many longer Lionel cars are meant to be used on broader curves.I use the curved track sections for displaying rare O-gauge cars in a 12"" radius corner shelving unit. Normally I use a full track and a half track6-65014 1/2 Curved single piece of track O27to fill the space. The reason for using the track, in addition to the fact that it adds to the display, is that it prevents my expensive antique cars from rolling or sliding off the shelf. For extra safety I attach the cars to the tracks with wire-ties on the back side where the wire-ties are not visible."
3,Returned 2 times . . .,While the sports cork board is cute - I've returned 2 of them and will not purchase another. The trophy pushpins leave an imprint in the cork board as well as some of the paint was rubbed off. The first one I ordered had a tear in the cork from a pushpin being shoved. The pushpins also leave very noticeable pin marks in comparison to other cork boards I've used/had.
4,Beautiful and soothing,"As a teacher of very young children, I am always looking for music. Music children can work to and relax to. My children love Three Little Mice which we listen to while having snack. Robin has a beautiful voice!! the next Diva of Jersey City. The music is soothing!!"
2,"Disappointed - opera-like singer, hard to understand","I was disappointed with this purchase. I listen to a lot of classical music and opera and was excited to hear about this classic as nursery rhymes are important for language development.....Anway, I don't know the proper term to describe the singer's voice, but it is very formal, like opera and very hard to understand the words. Not able to learn words and sing along.I listen to NPR/classical music/opera all day long and did not enjoy listening to this even once."
2,"Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs, Robin Hendrix","I wasn't able to listen to any tracks of this CD before buying it. Now that I've removed the plastic and listened, I can't return it, so thought I'd at least warn others. I was expecting more of a folk style, and this is classical, almost operatic music. I like classical music and even opera, but found it really awful in this context. We only listened to about 5 minutes in the car before I had to turn it off. My son (almost 2), however, was laughing. Maybe he likes it. I'll be sure to read more reviews and listen to lots of tracks in the future."
2,dull and boring,"I bought this based on the great ratings, good reviews and the bit about how this was wonderful music for both adults and children. I am an opera goer and yet the singing left me cold.My son won't listen to it for a moment (but will hum in tune toother classical music orchestrated for kids, like the Baby Einstein CDs). I've owned it for a year and barely listened to it for more than a few minutes at a time perhaps 3 times! A bad (and relatively expensive) buy."
1,YUK!!!!,"I was SOOOO disappointed. I checked my order to make sure I actually got the right CD?!??!?It sounds like opera. A woman singing the rhymes in such a high pitched voice and you can barely understand what she is saying. For young children, you want something sinmple clear and fun. This is boring- they all sound alike. I think maybe a scholar would like this CD, but certaintly not young children. (...)!!I can't believe all the excellent reviews and how misled I was."
2,Poor quality and not as advertised,"This Revere ""tri-ply"" saucepan is cheaply made, lightweight, and not 18/10 stainless steel as the product description states. The aluminum disk is applied to the bottom of the saucepan; the disk is not integral to the pan's constuction and does not cover the bottom of the saucepan. There's more than a half-inch of space between the outside edge of the disk and the saucepan's outside bottom edge; unless very low heat is used, food sticks where the disk doesn't cover. The saucepan also discolors and the finish dulls easily. There are several cheaper, more efficient, higher-quality 1-quart saucepans available; don't waste your money on this one."
1,name brand gone bad,Bought 2 of these on the strengh of a revere 1 quart pan I have had since the late 60's. After less than a year later I junked both of them. Impossible to clean starchy residue and then the bottom started to show black spots which I assume was the core layer. How ever the lids held up nicely.
5,Good quality,This sauce pan is of very good quality at a reasonable price. It is well-made and handy to use. It was delivered quickly in perfect condition.
3,Well...,"I did enjoy the book, I read it for an AP Lit assignment, the only thing I wasn't too keen on was the missing pages, it would completely skip sections with only a note saying that the transciber couldn't find that page, it was very annoying and left a few very awkward gaps in the story."
5,Great stuff,"A quick arrival, high quality buy, fantastic buy, would recommend to anyone. I will do buisness with these guys again."
1,"If this book was made into a movie, it would be ""straight to DVD""","I can't believe how many people like this book! The author is clearly an amateur - I was not surprised to see this is her first book. The story barely held my interest, the characters were flat, shallow, and one-dimensional and relied completely on stereotypes. The book has a series of one-liners that you can tell the author thought were witty and wrote onto a list, then plucked them off one by one to use in her book. It appears that the writer thinks her writing is clever and witty, but it really just reads like a sad first-attempt at a novel."
5,Funny and Endearing,"Wendy French has a great talent for creating a cast of amusingly flawed family members and a host of office cube ninnies with wit and sarcasm. In today's day of telemarketing, the main character holds one of those most-hated jobs, relegated to calling people who don't want to be bothered. She reminds us that telemarketers, too, are humans, although treated like ""livestock"" on a slaughter line. Somehow she takes the story of a young woman's pathetic circumstance and turns it into a satirical sitcom that is well worth the time to sit and read. I thoroughly enjoyed being entertained by French's refreshing storytelling in this wonderful tale of comedic woe or woeful comedy. A feel-good book!"
1,sMothering for the young crowd,"This book did not have a plot but it did have a theme - whine about my life. I checked it out of the library and am glad that I did not have to pay for it, as I wound up speed reading just to see if it ever came up with a plot other than introducing a bunch of loser characters. This is a definite read if you want to hold a pity party and need company but don't have any friends."
1,Cheap immitation.................,"They are trying to hype this book as a ""Bridget Jones"".They wish!It's a fast read because there is nothing of substance about it.The ending makes absolutely no sense and if I could return it and get my money back I would.For now I'll just have to make do with using it to line the birdcage."
3,Rum drink theme,"I appreciate rum drinks, now, from the text and from the photos. On page 50, however, I can't figure out why the drink in the photo is pink, when the ingredients comprise white rum, lime juice, sugar, and ice. A light, fifteen minute read."
5,The nicest export from Edmonton - the city of Champions,"An enchantress who grabs your heart strings and won't let go. She has a rich, melodious voice which is beautiful in every language she sings. If you can possibly get this early CD of Anna Maria Kaufmann you will have a treasure you won't want to part with. The songs include gems from Lord Lloyd Webber and Leonard Bernstein and the orchestration is great. I give it five stars plus!"
2,This is not like your old Revereware . . .,Have a 25 year old set of Revereware and just purchased this 3 qt. saucepan--the cover does not fit and the quality is not the same as my old pans. This new pan looks nice and shiny but I wish it was of the same quality as the original Revereware . . . are any pans made in the USA anymore???
3,Cooking Disasters,"I am really disappointed in the quality of my new pot..Reason being, my old one that size, that I have had for years ,was much heavier. I would still have the old one ,but due to my negligence one day, I forgot it was on the burner and turned on, it boiled dry and it was ruined...So much for that.!!!!"
4,Revere Copper Bottom Stainless Sauceppan,"A sturdy product. Had 1 2-Quart saucepan for years. It got discolored. Should not place the saucepan in dishwasher or it would lose its luster, as described in owner's manual. A versatile and good cooking utensil indeed."
3,Thin metal,"Revere Ware used to be heavy; now, it is thinner. Food burns more easily because the heat is not distributed nearly as well. My old Revere Ware is 40 years old and still looks good. I use it almost daily. I don't think this new piece will do as well."
3,Revere 3 quart sauce pot,The bottom of the pot is slightly concave and does not make full surface contact with the range. Probably not a problem for gas ranges but for electric tops some uneven heating occurs. Otherwise a very servicable utensil.
1,Not like the old Revereware,"I have both new and old the stove at this moment. My old saucepan is busy boiling some vegetables. The new one cannot come to a boil because the pot bottom is uneven. It wobbles on the stove. The pot is much lighter in weight and the handle is made of a cheaper material that gets very hot to the touch. The old pan has been my favorite for years, so I asked for a new one for Christmas. I hope my sister didn't buy one for herself on my recommendation. Revere should have raised their price, rather than turn their quality product into a cheap knock-off."
5,Where's the 4 quart version?,This is a great sauce pan. It heats evenly and cleans up easily. It's too bad that Revere no longer makes a 4 quart version.
3,not bad,"I have a set of revere ware that my wife purchased about 30 years ago. We love this cookware. It cooks evenly and has lasted well. I was looking to add a couple more saucepans to our collection. The new pots are not as heavy as the old ones, they are stainless steel, but are as light as aluminum. However, they do seem to distribute the heat as evenly as the old ones. We will see how well they last."
5,3 qt. revere covered saucepan,I love it...it replaced a revere saucepan that I had used for years and it's as practical and satisfying as the first pan.It was so great to be able to find revere products!Thanks!!
1,What happened?,I haven't bought any RevereWare in many years. Guess I won't again.The structure of the pans is not the same. Not as durableas the RevereWare of better times. Too bad.
1,ZERO STARS,"I tried it twice, thinking that maybe I just got a bum pan the first time. When you put it on a gas stove, the copper bottom actually disintigrates. It is not the pan, it is the whole product line. One would think that a pan meant to go on the stove would actually not ""melt."" I'm actually surprised that Revereware puts this out. It is an embarrasment to the company."
2,Made in Indonesia,"Well, we'll see. The packaging was such that it would be very inconvenient to send it back. Much to my dismay, I noticed on the back of the pot: Revere - Indonesia. Paul Revere was all about the United States of America. That's number 1. Number 2 is: I noticed some differences between the made in Indonesia pot and the pot that was made in Clinton, Illinois, namely that the Indonesian pot is lighter in weight, the handle really does look like it would burn more easily and would break more easily than the sturdy handle on the pots manufactured in the USA. And the inside for some reason doesn't seem to be as smooth.So, hopefully, I can somehow find my way to the money it'll take to buy some USA made steel pots from Pennsylvania that I saw in a local shop. And give up on these Chintzy ""Revere"" imitation pots. Send 'em back to Indonesia.Thank you very much !"
1,warped,"After 20 years, I needed to replace my 3 quart revere ware sauce pan. So I bought one, the bottom warped as soon the pan heated up. Returned the 1st one and was sent a second one, same problem. The new ones are thinner that the original set I had.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
4,best cooking pot ever................................,I have had my 3qt. for many years...took something to a neighbor in it...and he really liked it so I bought him one......have all sizes myself..bj
4,Revere Copper Bottom 3 qt Covered Saucepan,The pan was very nice and I was very please with the Amazon experience
5,Advertised but said not available,Do not advertise if not available. Have been looking for this product for soom time. My sister ruined the one I had. You advertised this product on a cleareance sale. What is wrong.
5,Convenience at its best!,"This is the perfect size...not too big, not too small. I may have to order another just to have a back-up!"
1,Not the quality I was expecting.,"I have owned a pot exactly like this one for over 20 years. It is the perfect size for boxed pasta & cheese products - so, it gets used a lot in my house. I wanted a couple more of them - so I didn't have to continuously wash the only one I had - so that I would have enough to keep up with the demand for use. So, I bought two of these. I had problems with both of them. The bottom on these felt thinner than the original. Both bottoms warped after the first couple of uses and one started super heating the boiling water - causing water to explode out of the pan. Very disappointing. I still have a need for more than one, but I'm very leery of buying online again. I haven't been able to find it in stores, so I will be forced to go online again. Maybe I'll try a different seller, in the hopes of getting better quality."
2,Too thin,"We own Revere pots from 25 years ago and they are great. This one however is made of much thinner steel and burned the very first thing I put in it - so no, I don't like it. I will try to get some old used one next time."
1,Lightweight piece of junk,I ordered this pan beacuse I liked the old RevereWare pan I have had and wanted another. I received this pan and could not believe how much lighter and of less quality it was as compared to the original RevereWare pan I have had for years. I looked on the botom of the new pan and it is made in China. IS IS A PIECE OF JUNK. I returned the pan. I would not recommend this pan to anyone.
1,"Metal sides, bottom are WAY too thin!","We were quite surprised at how thin the metal is. The ""Revereware"" stamp on the copper bottom shows through very prominently from the inside of the pan (!). It weighs much less than our old Revereware sauce pan. Is the product just less durable now, or has ""built-in self-destruct so you have to buy a new one sooner"" policy crept in from the auto industry?According to the info that came with the product, it was made in Indonesia.We looked in several local stores but could not find Reverware at all, or could only find large sets, so we ordered it on-line here. Not worth it, it seems.My wife says she won't buy Revereware anymore."
1,ZERO stars - total junk with dangerous metal residue ...,The quality of this pot is complete junk. I made a mistake of throwing out the packaging and now I am stuck with this POS. The worst part about this pot is that the interior surface is very rough and covered with dangerous metal residue from poor manufacturing process.I spent 35 minutes scrubbing it off AFTER the pot was put through a dishwasher. I am still not comfortable using this for food preparation. They should pull this terrible product off the market immediately -- it's simply irresponsible for this company to sell this crap to it's customers.See attached picture -- the paper towel on the left shows how much metallic residue was on the pot AFTER it came from the dishwasher. The paper towel on the right is the amount of residue that was still there after I scrubbed the pot with a dish washing sponge for over 10 minutes!
2,"Cheap, tinny disappointment","It wasn't an expensive pot, but it's a shadow of The RevereWare I've used before. The lid fits poorly, which does not enhance its use for steaming. IKEA's 365+ line is a much better value, but their website is wicked hard to use."
5,Fine Sauce Pan,"This sauce pan is not massively thick, nor does it sport a huge ergonomically designed space-age rubber handle or industrial-size rivets. It also lacks the engraved name of a celebrity television chef. Yet when I fill it with water and apply heat to the bottom, the water boils. The amazing phenomenon of heating also occurs when food is placed in the pan. The finish is shiny, and the lid fits well. The pan and its lid can go in the dishwasher. I ask no more."
4,just a bit too big,"I really have found this book useful, but it will weigh you down and hurt your aerodynamics. I liked the sections on labs and differentials as a 3rd year, and found the procedure walkthroughs to be useful as a 4th year. For residency I plan to go completely with the PDA."
4,The best album of Swallow The Sun,"If you put in a blender a little bit of sadness, hate, anger, and a lot of musical talent, you will get Hope, an awsome Masterpice"
5,Buy Now,"I'd like to start of by stating that I enjoy bands like Opeth, Ahab and November's Doom. My review is from that perspective.This is the first album I bought from the band; they were recommended to me by a friend. This album is amazing. From the first track, I was hooked. The opener starts off quiet and then explodes in to a heavy, catchy riff. I personally enjoy the contrasting clean and harsh vocals. The first song is a perfect example of this contrast combining to create one amazing song. The album is full of these amazing songs. My two favorite songs are ""Hope"" and ""The Justice Of Suffering."" Since these two songs are number 1 and 3 on the album, respectively, I didn't end up listening to the entire CD for a couple of days.If you only enjoy clean vocals, this album is definitely not for you.If you only enjoy harsh vocals, you might want to consider ""The Morning Never Came.""If you enjoy a combination of both, this album is perfect."
5,Muy bueno,"Recomiendo este libro a todas las mujeres, es tan interesante y me ayudo a conocerme bastante y comprender mi vida , valorarme y lo mas importante a vivir mejor."
5,El libro que siempre recomiendo primero.,"Este libro fue -recetado- para mí luego de que sufriera una depresión. Y fue... como si saliera el sol. Me cambió mi perspectiva inmediatamente. Es el libro que más veces he leído. De todos los libros de mi colección, éste es mi favorito. Es el primer libro que recomiendo. Incluso, lo he regalado varias veces. Es un exito! =)"
1,bad,"came in 15 days when they were supposed to only 7 days maximum, better for 2 dollars more to buy in the bookstore"
3,Interesting....could be better.,"Firstly, there are no Smiths/Morrissey songs or music in this documentary. Afterall, it is an unauthorized piece.Secondly, expect lots of interviews. Can be quite boring at times, ie when Stephen Street and Vini Reilly going back and forth arguing who has the rights to the songs blah blah blah.Thirdly, this documentary does cover up til You Are the Quarry. But only in the last 10 mins of the show.Overall, it's an interesting piece but could be better."
3,the best thing about this dvd is the picture on the cover,"I love Morrissey, obviously - or i wouldn't have watched this, but as a documentary this one is a sleeper.. Details from Morrissey's career are nice, but the reliance on the twitter-twatter of past producers and alienated bandsmen leaves us feeling that we are not seeing too much of the man Morrissey really is.. I do like the descriptions of how he lives his life - rearanging furniture to confuse guests and so forth - but with no actual footage or music from Morrissey - or at least interviews with him - we feel like we are learning nothing..."
2,WRONG VIDEO PRESENTATION,"The Video advertises to be about the Viet Cong, so I was expecting a National Geographic type doccumentary of the Military of North Viet Nam. What this video actually is is a low quality US Airforce presentation outlining the American POW experience such at the ""Hanoi Hilton."" It was produced for the sole purpose of being an Airforce training video and so is devoid of interviews, speculation, outside commentary or anythingelse that would detract from a military instructional brief. Honestly it was bad, but was something totally different then what was advertized. FIX IT AMAZON!"
2,I should have paid attention,"10-Point Rating: (3.5), (4.5 if price factor is ignored)This is one of those overpriced collections of academic papers published by a university press consisting of poor paper and a terrible bind. I really should have paid attention to the fact that this book was listed at only 179 pages and measured a sparse .82 inches at the spine. For the price I was expecting a bold and challenging collection of seminal papers on the ontology of the divine. Instead, I received what could pass for a collection of the final papers of a freshman course in ecumenism. Non-systematic and somewhat juvenile in the level of presentation, it speaks volumes when the best piece in a book on the philosophy of the nature of the divine is titled ""Feminism and the Christ"" (a good piece, really)."
1,Bait and Switch,"This company misleads you. The perfume doesn't smell the same. I have been buying Lumiere by Rochas for 17 years and still have a little left. I compared the two and the one from this company does not have the same smell. I even sprayed one on each arm and asked two people if both arms smelled the same, and they said no.(I hadn't told them before hand either). Also the bottle the perfume came in is totally different from the picture on the web site, and the bottle that the real Lumiere comes in (the purple bottle); and the sprayer on both bottles doesn't spray correctly (I had purchased two bottles). I will never purchase anything from them again and I'm going to try and get my money back."
1,Worst Action Film ever,This was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. In one scene it went from winter to spring and back. The fight scenes were down right funny. maybe the actors should of watched A Rocky film to see how to throw a punch. in the end I feel it is best to save your money and watch old reruns of Batman
4,Great low budget action!,"This was a well produced low-budget action movie! Good story, good characters, and above all it was just fun!"
4,Back to basics,"This film had a good amount of martial arts which were obviously performed by the actors themselves. Very rare in this day and age. It seems anymore that there are standins for this or standins for that but when a movie like this comes along it is nice to see some very talented martial artists who are able to apply their martial prowess on film. This film was also a fantastic display of action without relying on the typical blood,gore and nudity shown in quite a few other films of the same genre. It is refreshing to see some high caliber fighting and very good acting in a low budget film. I would recommend this film to anyone who misses the days of just plain old martial arts action."
1,I call it as I see it....,"...and I see a movie that follows closely in the footsteps of the lower budget Cynthia Rothrock movies.Dragon and the Hawk has to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. This martial arts film (using the phrase in its most liberal form), had sloppy, poorly coordinated fight scenes, little to no character development, and bad editing. Dont waste your time with this flick, yor better off watching the drunks behind 7-11 duke it out, its more entertaining and at least they can fight!For the record...its LOUISIANA"
1,Fit for MST3K,"Yikes!Never before have I seen such a poorly developed plot, negligent editing, and a haphazard, undeveloped group of characters shoved into one suffering film. I would NOT reccomend this film. Overall, this film falls way short of meeting the standards of the beloved low-budget martial arts flicks of yesteryear.20 years down the line, the makers of this film will sound like Adam West when he claims that the Batman series was ""all for fun"" and ""not to be taken seriously."""
5,Awesome,Not a fun shoot em' up. A realistic take on how freaking hard it would be to be a leader of one of these nations. Interesting. Hard. Fun.
5,really interesting stuff,"This game really provides food for thought.Did not get the video/sound to work, but I suspect it would simply be a drag on the action. A friend of mine was a Northern Ireland government minister and is also deeply involved in the Sri Lanka dispute. He was sucked into the game in minutes, and wouldn't give up.The most useful part is being able to play both sides of the conflict. Many Israelis cannot image what it feels like to be on the Palestinian side and vice versa. This game gives both sides the chance to look at the other side of the fence."
3,Somewhere in Gerany; An Autobiographical Novel,"Interesting and unique book, but not as good as ""Somewhere in Africa"" which is the story of the author's early life."
4,Good tent and easy to use,"I bought this for backpacking and it worked very well. The set up was quick and simple and was easily done by just myself. The tent's sack easily holds everything with no problems. Many tent manufacturers will give you a packing sack that can seemingly only be packed by a robot with expertise in applied physics. Not this tent. It easily packs up.My only caveat is, because it's a 1 person tent, it can be snug and that means you'll rub up against the sided. Morning condensation could be your wake up call. This is especially problematic for those who use down sleeping bags that AREN'T treated. Just a fair warning.Other than that, it's a good tent if you need to set one up far off the beaten path. Might want to get a better rain fly, though. The cover on the tent isn't bad, but it won't keep out the rain if the wind decides to blow it in at an angle. But that's my only problem with it, really."
5,Good tent for bicycle touring,"I do a couple of bicycle touring trips per year. I wanted a lightweight solo tent that would be easy to carry on the bike, accomodate my 6' 3"" height and also be easy to put up and take down. I tried the Eureka Solitaire and found it to be a little too confining for me. Also tried a Wenzel Starlite bivy tent that was a little smaller than I'd like. I think the Backcountry 1 is just the right combination of size and weight for carrying on a bike or backpacking. I have used it three times now and am very happy with it."
5,Better than expected,"Took a risk buying this tent on my way to my last backcountry hiking weekend on August 17-19, 2007.It set up quickly with no struggle. I found that if I removed the poles from the stuff sack and packed them vertically I could gain even more space. This tent packs & compresses small. I love it.Ventilation is awesome even with the rain fly. I did get rained on but stayed perfectly dry and NO condensation.There's also lots of room and I'm 6'4"" @ 235 lbs, easy to move around, sit up, get in & out. I kept my day pack at the side of my feet IN THE TENT and was not cramped. Temperature dropped at night so I had to put on some extra clothing - plenty of room to shuffle about.I researched 1person tents for a while and I'm thriled that I decided on this one."
5,Eureka Solo Back Country (1) Tent,"I use this to carry on the back of my motorcycle. It is the perfect size and weight to strap onto the back of my bike, and take off for overnight trips."
4,A good tent,Backcountry 1 is a good one men tent. I like its small packing size and strong poles. Also its green colour blends easily to the surroundings.
5,very satisfy customer,I was very satisfy with the item and the speedy delivery. My son was very please and eager to use it.
3,price good,"Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but it seems a good piece of gear for the price and size"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"It is very hard not to a like a cute talking penguin, and Breathed presumably realised this when coming up with Opus. The human characters that surround the odd animal are supposed to come off somewhat loopier. This is a fun look at the period and the politics, and highly entertaining. Aack!"
3,Legends review,Unless you really like all brass band music I think you are better off buying their brassed off soundtrack - which is excellent.Dave
4,Hours of enjoyment,"This puzzle was a joy to put together. The picture has brilliant colors. It was challenging, but not too difficult. I also had many compliments on the beauty of the puzzle from others, and they were drawn in to find a few pieces for themselves. The puzzle interlocked well, and the pieces were of good thickness."
4,Oddisse's Odyssey!,"Oddisse is undoubtable one of my favourite Producer/Mcee. He has such raw wealth of untained abilities, but with that said I would like him to grow musically and as well as an artist. This album is proof that he has seriousskillz. The flow of the tracks could have been more sound. Now I understand this is a mix album but I would havepreferred the track to be much longer.Overall though this is a good album. Buy it!!"
4,Kings of the Post Grunge Genre,"I picked up this album after being turned on to ""Software Slump"" which is a 2000 release and was thrilled! This album is simply fantastic. The guitar hooks are basic but very catchy and the band has a quality that I haven't seen before.Think of Pavement mixed with a trucker driving along I-99 (in Central California for those who do not live in the golden state) and you'll get what im talking about. Its not as sound effects oriented as Pavement and not as disonant as Sonic Youth and simply lies somewhere in between. I think this band has moved into a more record company oriented (or Pink Floyd) type of sound on Software Slump but think this album is a hallmark of Indie music that is an untouched gem.A must buy if you are a fan of bands like Nirvana, Pavement, and Smashing Pumpkins but are looking for whats next for that type of sound."
3,Very good stuff...,"Having been bitten by the ""S.Slump"" bug (as in, can't get that damned CD out of my player!), I have been going-back into Grandaddy's catalogue to see what other gems are to be found. While nowhere near as polished or addictive as ""S.Slump"", this debut E.P. does show that the band has been onto a pretty good sound for a while now. The songs are somewhat sketchy and not nearly as fleshed-out as the more recent releases, but it's still quite good, well worth checking-out. I've seen many stores charging full-price for this release-- if you are looking to flesh-out your Grandaddy collection and include this release, do yourself a favour and order it from Amazon! At this price, you're sure to be happy with what is best described as a 'very promising debut'."
4,A good new career in the bud,"I write mainly because the previous review of ""4"" is way off base. ""Penance"" isn't perfect, but a lot of fun ... definitely a goodly-twisted plot. As a transplanted Minnesotan I must say the local desciptions are well done with a hell of a lot more detail (in both geography AND plot) then Mary Higgen Clark's ""Pretend You Don't See Her"" ... you KNOW Housewright has at least set foot in the state. Housewright is following well John Sandford's large shadow."
5,Great Gumshoe Detective,"This is a good ol' gumshoe detective story that brought me somewhere between Sam Spade and Harry Bosch. I'm ready to read more of Minnesota detective Holland Taylor, and you will be too if you haven't already! Can't give away anything because you have to sit on the edge of your seat and quickly turn pages like I did. Follow every idea as he feels it. I'm really impressed with this author and this series. Thanks!"
3,3.5 stars - A credible first book,"The plot is over-involved and Taylor needed a little more dimensionality. Even the character admits to his occasional TSTL moments. But the story is fast-paced with some wonderful moments and is a very credible first book. Having read one of his recent books of a new series, I do know he's an author worth reading. That said, I do recommend this book and look forward to reading the next two in the Taylor series."
2,A cluttered and disappointing mystery.,"Despite having won the Edgar Award, ""Penance"" left me disappointed. Holland Taylor, a Private Investigator who was formerly a homicide detective in Minnesota, starts off as an interesting character and the plot seems to hold promise. However, as the book proceeds, Taylor rapidly becomes less sympathetic, and his facile observations on life become grating. Morever, the plot twists are generally uninteresting, with the story ending in a whimper rather than a bang.Perhaps there's better work down the road for David Housewright, but I found this to be an unimpressive start"
3,PENANCE: CLICHE-RIDDEN AND OBVIOUS,"There are flashes of solid writing in Housewright's ""Penance,"" but it's difficult to get past all the ""tough-guy private investigator"" cliches to truly appreciate them. Holland Taylor is an combination of every bad TV cop/private eye you can think of, from his expertise in the martial arts to his adversarial relationship with the police. Though many of the reviews on the book's cover laud Housewright's ""cleverly twisted plot,"" I found it to be convoluted and far-fetched. Housewright even caps his string of cliches by gathering all of the suspects into one room at the story's climax and allowing Holland Taylor to explain it all. In spite of this, the book is well paced and, at times, enjoyable. I hope in his next book that Housewright can give Holland Taylor a little more personality than the fact that he's a Minnesota Twins fan with a dead wife and kid."
4,Great Performing,A touching story of eight year old boy witnessing parents' infidelity and struggle to keep a family together.Brilliant performing of child actor itself must to see.
2,"sometimes funny,sometimes weird","I was dissappointed in this story.Dave the monkey man seemed to be part Archie McNally and some of Carl Hiassen's characters.The heroine,Anabelle Hardy-Maratos,could have been much more interesting. She is a little stiff and apparently confused.Is she a business executive or a femme fatale. She wears a backless dress to a business meeting?Dave wears womens shoes, which everyone knows are more uncomfortable then mens shoes.The opening line was great,But the story became confusing and boring.The person who kills the scientist is not much of a mystery, and the psychopath remains at large.I would hope that the characters become more realistic,fun, and caring as the series continues.A good beginning,average middle, and strange ending with many loose ends."
1,Dated...in a bad way,"Quintessence were a solid pub band around London and England in the early seventies. I had Gunga Mai on a famous sampler on the Island Label called ""Nice Enough to Eat"". Gunga Mai is the best track on this selection. The rest sounds like a mixture of Spinal Tap and Tenacious D, with one notable exception....this is serious. Stay Away"
1,NOT GREAT,INSPIRED BUT UNREFINED CHEAP STUDIO THROW AWAYS...THE BEST I CAN DO WITH THIS...IT HAS ONE OR TWO MOMENTS THAT ARE RUINED BY SOMETHING STUPID....
4,Capable Astro-dapter,"I got this adapter to connect my new E-510 to my telescope using a T-mount tube. The telescope manufacturer offers the T-mount, and then you adapt your camera to it. I later learned that I could have just used my OM to E-volt adapter with my old OM to T-mount, but this way I can still keep my film camera set up for astrophotography separately. Because of the very fine threads on the T-mount, though, changing adapters is not as easy as it sounds. Lining up the threads is difficult unless you make the T-mount connection first, without the camera weight to fight against."
4,Solidly made T-mount adapter,"I bought this item for use on my new Olympus E-Volt E-620. It fits well with no shake or wobble. It is an all-metal item, with no moving parts. it will NOT connect for any automatic functions, nor is it meant to.I am using this adapter with an old Spiratone 4x zoom slide duplicator. Because of the approximately 1/4 thickness of the adapter and the design of the four-thirds mount system, I am unable to focus at the lowest magnifications, and the zoom factor is increased as well. I am copying old 1/2-frame slides, and still must crop at least a quarter of the image area. I had a few Minox-size slides (16x12mm) and the blew up beautifully. If you are using this item on a telescope or microscope this may not be a problem. It might even be an advantage. BUT BE AWARE: the four-thirds format magnifies about 50% more than other digital format mounts."
2,Does exactly what it says and works well,"I am very happy with this product. It connects my Olympus camera to my Celestron telescope perfectly and works like a champ. I would buy this item again without hesitation, however, I would probably buy from a different company. It took them way too long to package and ship it to me (6 days to package it)"
2,"Not her best, but worth the price for paperback","I am a big fan of Harvest which is why I bought Peggy Sue. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Apparently Tess tried out romance before she moved over to medical thrillers and this is a sad mix of Harlequin romance with just a little bit of thrill worked in the story. If you are looking for a book that is more romance than I would rec. reading this one. But if you are searching for a larger quantity of medical info & thrills...keep on searching. Tess is heading in the right direction (as seen in Harvest & Bloodstream) but needs to get past the mushy romance angle. Final thought: It's not her best work, but with paperbacks it's worth the price."
4,Fun Info,"Nearly 70 years after making her debut, Betty Boop is still going strong especially in the area of collectibles. To prove this ongoing popularity, the Biography Channel, which mostly chronicles human celebrities and historical figures, traced the origins of this cartoon character. Clips include the spicy early black & white toons and the classic spooky thriller with Cab Callowy singing ""St. James Infirmary Blues."""
4,Yesssss!!!!!!!!!!,Jumpin juhoasafats I love it. I just picked this up two days ago I love it. This group is becoming one of my top 10 groups.
4,Great studying tool,"I just passed the PMP exam and it was in some part due to the materials found in this book. First, I love the format of the book...flash cards on the go. The book is comprised of chapters for each of the process areas and each chapter contains 60 questions and answers regarding the materials. The 60 questions/answers are formatted like flash cards which allows you to quiz yourself...and the spiral bound style allows you to flip through them easily. Second, this book provides information which is not covered in the PMBOK but you need to know in order to pass the test (such as various quality management concepts, communication styles, etc).I found this book extremely helpful and would recommend it to anyone studying for the exam."
4,On-the-Go Studying,"As project managers, we become time management pros, and this resource supports this skill. I really liked this ""flash card style"" studying medium that ESI International developed. Without pulling out hefty books and manuals, it's a great way to study terms and theories when you may have only 10 or 20 minutes of time that would normally be unproductive. Its compact size makes it very portable to use when you are sitting (not driving!) in the car, between off-site meetings, waiting at soccer or dance practice, and during lunch just to name a few. It's a great accompaniment to your studying materials. Good luck in your endeavor!"
4,a great resource,"I recently passed the PMP and used this book to study at odd times, great for just flipping open and reviewing a few items. Very comprehensive alot of depth."
1,not the book for PMP exam,i passed the PMP exam yesterday. i was using this book and it wasn't helpful at all. the questions are 4 choice questions but the book is given them in a question-answer methood. i recommend looking for the right book elsewhere
1,Do Not Buy This DVD,"This is a wonderful movie, one of Hitchcock's best if you like vintage B&W; flicks. The acting is superb, and it has an ample share of Hitchcockian humor.But this particular version is the WORST digitization of a move I have ever seen. The images are muddy at best, and there is obvious and annoying digital noise visible throughout the movie.By all means, buy the movie.But don't buy this dog by Triad."
2,the 39 steps,"Product was advertised as digitally remastered. However, upon viewing the DVD was almost completely defective. Plenty of freeze frames, jumps and scrambling. Very poor quality...must be a ""knockoff"" from China!! Needless to say, this DVD will be returned. Pass on this one!!"
3,Not a good restoration,"This is a classic Hitchcock suspense movie but the sound is mushy and the visual quality isn't much better, I had hoped for better."
1,The 39 Steps,"This DVD is the worst quality of any DVD I have seen. It is unviewable. I have $1 DVDs that are better quality. Amazon should never have allowed this DVD into their warehouse let alone sell it. Is there NO product controll at Amazon? Fortunately TCM ran the movie recently and the quality was very good, so I know a good copy is out there somewhere, just not at Amazon."
3,hard to swallow,"The content of this vitamin is great, and the natural ingredients are something very important to me, but the tablets are huge, and I had to give up on them, because the act of swallowing them just about made me throw up. Even cutting them in half wasn't the greatest solution. I switched to a liquid natural whole food vitamin, which I like very much."
2,WHEELS ON STROLLER SUCK,"The car seat is great and the stroller is nice as long as you are going straight. When you want to turn, the wheels stick. I would give the stroller a 0 rating. Car seat is really nice though. Saw some ladies in the mall with the same stroller and they also complained about the same problem. I had to go out and buy another stroller because it was that awful to use.."
3,Nice Ring,The ring's are stamped sterling silver and they were shipped to me in a timely manner. It's a nice ring but it looks better in the picture than it does in person.
5,Antique wedding band set,I got this wedding set when i could no longer wear my orginal bands. I got so many wow your rings are so beautiful they must been in your family for generations.
3,price makes it worthwhile,"This product is just ok. The pump handle does not pump well without fully extending. Sometimes it doesn't ""catch"" and no air is released. The guage doesn't keep a constant reading which would be more helpful. Overall the price makes it worthwhile."
3,A Flawed Collection,"An excellent collection of short to medium length stories, all dealing with Antarctic expeditions and what the adventurers found (but wish they hadn't).I only gave this book three stars because of the horrible proof-reading. It appeared as if the original documents had been scanned in and run through OCR software without a human bothering to check the results. Some examples: in one story, Tekeli-li is printed T>k>li-li; in one story all instances of ""he"" are printed as ""be"".Other than that, I would recommend this collection to anyone interested in weird fiction set in Antarctica."
2,almost....almost....almost good,"againandagainandagain. it gets almost interesting. lovecraft's scientific story ending up with nothing much of a climax, Poe drowning in nautical technical information and fragmentary style. taine's is the most interesting one. first too little happens, then too much. could have been good, but is first too boring then too much in the overwhelming action-genre. glasby has good descriptions, but his story doesn't go anywhere. some of the other stories could have been good too. but always, something destroys. too boring, not going anywhere, lacks suspence. truly sad since many of the stories shows potential."
2,Bingo Cage and balls,"The set is very sturdy. However, the balls are different colors and the dark green and dark blue colors make the numbers extremely hard to read. I would have thought the manufacturer would have noticed that."
4,Great for little ones,"The only negative is that the numbers get rubbed off very easily. I tried to rewrite with a permanent marker, but that rubs off even faster. I'm going to try taping the numbers on next. The cage seems to be made well. No problems with balls falling out.I bought it for a birthday party, and I had a table of full of children as young as 3 playing for a long time. They loved it. My son loves to spin the cage and read off the numbers. Great for teaching number and pattern recognition."
4,Bingo game,"I teach a middle school French class, and I use this to teach/practice numbers. I call them out in French, and when the kids think they have a bingo (""Et Voila!"") they read me their numbers in French. It's great practice."
4,Give it Three Listens,"That's all you will need to get hoked on this album. Paul Kelly has been described as the Austrailian Bob Dylan, but I'm sure over there, much like it is here, that is a dangerous thing. If anything, he's a cross between a subdued Paul Westerberg and a reflective John Hiatt. Kelly has a pretty great ability to weave a tale together and blend it into an infectius melody. His lyrics, while not always complex, have a way of leaving it up to the listener to explain away, but not before he has dragged one of your emotions into the picture. If there is doubt about purchasing this CD, find a way to listen to ""Love Never Runs On Time"", and then tell me you don't want it."
5,Wanted Man,"As usual, another fabulous album from one of Australia's great songwriter/artists. Each song a story in itself. Highly recommended. If you aren't into Paul Kelly, make this your intro to many great albums."
5,jetski anchor,"these anchors work great.can fill with almost anything.dont recommend attaching more than 1 ski,wont hold up in high wind.the jetski can float away with the anchor so keep an eye on it :/"
5,Stinky sinker,"I did a search for ""doo doo canoe"" and this thing is what showed up. I guess this anchor is what you use if you're up shit's creek"
4,Great for personal water craft and large rafts,"We purchased this to anchor our ""floating island."" It worked great. It is easy to fill and keeps the raft in place. The only complaint is the top doesn't cinch down real well and thus you can lose sand and rocks out of the top when the waves push on the raft, causing the bag (anchor) to pull and tug."
3,"Good thought, less workes",They heve thpught to produce this item great. I mean the idea.But it doesnt hold my 2006 Seadoo GTX. You cannot trust this anchor full filled with sand.Maybe you can try to put a big stone with sand inside but the area is not too big andthe stone also can tear up cover.Feedback: They can make the ancor a little bit bigger and could put a hardstaff tie at the top(because it is opening by the wave).the cover should be bigger and thicker.Finally I am not happy and I wont trust this anchor if you are not watching your boat and if you dont have chance fo immediate interfering.
1,cheap plastic,"ive only used this sand anchor once, and im pretty sure the next time i use it its gonna fall apart. the top doesnt stay closed and the seams are poorly constructed, i would not recommend this product to anyone as i will be looking for a better one soon"
2,Bare Minimum for Porta-Potties,"I have used this porta-potty for a few years, but having upgraded recently, I wished I had done that long ago. It does work, but it is very low to the ground, flushing mechanism is weak and is prone to leaks. Spend a few more dollars for a better unit.MAN TIP- If you want your female companion to take to the wilds with you again get the best porta-potty money can buy. If you want to scare her off, get this one."
1,"leaks from the flush handle, now from 3 1/2"" dia o-ring","This is a very poor quality unit and should be an embarrassment to Coleman. I could find no seal around the shaft that slided the flush plate. A substantial leak occurs during each use. Now the large o-ring the seals the upper and lower compartments is leaking. No pun intended, this is a piece of crap."
1,Leaks when emptied,"I bought this item thinking, because it's a Coleman product it would be good.. It was very hard to turn the flush handle... but what was worse , was when I emptied it into the real toilet in the house, it leaked all over... I figured maybe I didnt have the knobs screwed on right.. but.. the 2nd time I emptied it, I really tried to be oh, so careful, and it still leaked.. was a disgusting mess.. it must have leaked through the flush hole. And then, when I thought it was all out, I went out side to take the garden hose to rinse it out. It looked like all the waste was out so I tipped it upside down and wammo! It still had waste flying out. What a waste of money. I am not using it again and taking the chance of it leaking.Going to buy one of those ones that has a bucket and empty it every day.and then , I read other's reviews... and wished I had read them before I bought it."
1,Leaks like a sieve,"This portable toilet worked okay for first week we had it. Then, the hose inside attached to the bellows pump, fell off inside the top half (water tank) so now we have to carry water in jugs to rinse it/flush it. The blade valve leaks and allows odor to escape and raw matter to leak out when the flush handle is pulled. Would not recommend this product to anyone. Maybe this is why it is now discontinued."
1,useless,"this toilet was completley useless! my friend dr. croft used it while we were bussing to zimbabwe and it spilled everywhere! i think the thing isnt waterproof. manager insisted that toilet should not have been used upside down, but how else are you supposed to empty it out!"
2,More like History of Gardening,"I was disappointed. It was more a history of gardens than anything else. They described historic gardens in cursory detail. Yes, it's a pretty book but most of the photos are in black & white because these gardens are the real thing (i.e. from the turn of the century), the color photos are of artwork. If you're looking for inspiration or how-to's, bypass this one."
5,A Treasure,"Everyone interested in this book should read the introduction. The author's interest was piqued when she discovered that little had ever been written about a type of garden truly indigenous to the United States, what she names, ""Grandmother's Garden"". The book is a treasure for anyone interested in history, flower gardening, art, and biography. One of the most original, interesting, and beautiful books I know of. It is in a category by itself."
5,grandmothers garden,"Read this book from a local library, and determined that I would like to add it to my collection. Found it available through Amazon as a used book. When I received it, it was in brand new condition, as if I had just purchased it from a book store.Delivery was shorter than advised.Overall, fabulous service from the book-seller."
5,Great Sliders and Connections,"I have owned the ttm57 Rane Mixer for three years and I have fun every time I use it.Pros: The Mixer works great with Serato and SL Video. I like the loop adjustment ease, and effects. Once I got used to how it worked it was easier to map in the dark. I used all of the connections on the back and I think they work great. The Mic input works better than my mic mixer. I have two Technics mk1200s connected to it for vinyl control with Serato. I like the feel of the vinyl, and the easy integration with analog. I often play sets with both, and I like to have digital on one side and analog on the other, and it sounds great. The Headphone fader is also an excellent feature, and must have.Cons: The buttons are small, I would rather have lighted buttons, especially for the dark DJ sets. I also wish the Headphone jack was higher on the front of the case due to it hitting my flight case."
2,Slow moving,"I thought that this book was quite slow moving. After spending quite a while introducing the characters, it finally started to get really good about three-quarters of the way through. If you are a fan of Catherine Gaskin, you should read this, if not, there are other books to read."
5,deep insight of lives in fear,The green Irish countryside trembles as red Irish blood colors it's pastures and byways.
5,"A moving, powerful and memorable story.","The author writes with insight and compassion about the O'Faolain family, as seen through the eyes of Kathy, an American woman married to an Irishman and living in Northern Ireland. It is a story about responsibilities and passion; about family, loyalty and love; and mostly, it is about the human spirit. Quite simply, BORDER CROSSINGS is breathtaking!"
4,It's Impossible Not to be Swept Away,"...by the tide of emotions that march across Katherine O'Faolain's heart in BORDER CROSSINGS--from love to bitter hatred, from helplessness to hope that rises when she grasps at a tiny shard of light. Hats off to Ms Bellacera for reminding us that love can conquer even the most war-torn and uncertain future. I can't wait to read more of her work."
4,"It's great, but wait","This was my introduction to (authentic) slack key guitar and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's truly beautiful stuff. I originally bought it as background music for a luau party, but I couldn't stop playing it -- in the foreground. However the CD that is in release now has two bad/damaged tracks. Unless you want some really horrible noises coming from the speakers, wait to purchase this one. I had three copies of it before I just gave up (despite the wondeful customer service from Amazon.com). I ended up re-burning the CD without the damaged tracks. Wait for a re-release -- it will be worth it."
2,apple earbuds..,"when i put them in my ears, the buds do not fit into my ear. they are so big and there is no possible way to fit. even though the sound is pretty good, i was expecting more from them."
1,Bitter Disappointment,"Cooking is a joy and a hobby for me, when accurate instructions are provided. Regrettably, I was no further into this book than page 8 before discovering a substantive error: Chicken Breast Roulade clearly must require more than 1/8 cup (2 Tbsp.) Chicken Stock in order to produce final portions of 1-1/2 Tbsp. for each of four servings, particularly after it has been reduced by half. Pages 11 and 12 show lovely photographs which, regrettably, are mis-identified. With such careless editing, how can one trust anything else in the contents?"
4,Cooking With the Diabetic Chef,"Excelent book for those who want to cook better for the Diabetic, good learning source for the non-diabetic. Would recomend this to anyone who needs additional info re: cooking & preparing meals for the diabetic."
1,A bitter disappointment as well.,"Nothing impressive about this book. In fact, this is one of those cookbooks I wish I never purchased. Does not go far enough in talking about the relationship of food and diabetes and is filled with only so-so recipes. You would be better off purchasing a good cookbook and cooking recipes centered around protein dishes."
2,works only on XP,"This game's engine does not seem to work on Windows 7. It runs excellent on Windows X P only. If you have Windows 7 Pro and download the Windows x p version from Microsoft, there's a chance it could load."
2,Gets tired fast....,"Doom series and Quake 1-2 had great single playe questlines, bosses, insane mayhem and just are perfect games that I legions of people still enjoy today, but Quake III is just a fail. Even single player is just going around in small levels fighting multiplayer bots, it gets tired quick."
5,This book is a MUST for any C/C++ programmer,"This book helped me through my courses at College and helped many other students I mentored or tutored to Ace their programming courses as well. No matter if your are a 'once in a while' coder, a UNIX/LINUX system admin, or a production quality C programmer, you can find it fast in this book, and save yourself time-wasting referencing of large tomes, online help guides, 'man' pages etc. For all of the core language features you need to know but might not remember when you really need it."
3,"Missing some essentials, and could be organized better","While the book is decent, it is missing some essentials. For example, the book has open(), but not close(). Also, get used to looking something up in the index, since it's organized by type of command/function, instead of alphabetically. If you're looking for a C reference, this isn't really the best book, since it caters more towards C++ functions. Finally, it doesn't tell you if a command is C, C++, ANSI, Posix, or UNIX system based. There are much better books, but this is about as cheap as they come."
3,"This is a good book, but...","This is a good book, but I was looking for a complete, quick reference. Also, the references could have been a little more in-depth.I give the book 3 stars because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for in a quick reference."
5,Excellent C/C++ reference,"This book is a ""Must Have"" for any serious C/C++ programmer. It is not intended for people learning to program, but is excellent for people who want to know: what is the format of operator overloading, or a C++ template, or the parameters to the strstr function. It is well laid-out whith function names and keywords highlighted so that they are easily seen when thumbing through the pages. Very good table of contents and index."
1,Sorry It's not for me and I think also not for you,"Hi. A reference of c AND c++ in only 416 pages , sorry I dont think so.take a look at Nicolai Josuttis book for example , without dealing even in the language syntax his great book about C++ library (standard) is 800 pages !so puting c and c++ in only half the space is simply not enough. the text is very shalow - herb we acpect more from you!A survey of the table of contents is far more disturbing because well over half the book is dedicated to brief documentation of the Standard C Library (and you would be far better off with Plauger's 'The Standard C Library for that). Much of the rest is a cursory and incomplete coverage of the Standard C++ Library.simply say it - NOEnjoy"
5,I Applaud Laura's Bravery & Strength,"Behind the Mask, by Laura E. Holman takes you on a page turning journey of one woman's strength as she is faced with one hurt and disappointment after another. Laura has taken many destructive routes in life, attempting to fill a void that she later finds out only God can fill. I applaud Holman's strength as she boldly exposes predators that hide behind deceitful smiles of trust. Laura reminds us we are not alone and we don't have to walk with our heads hung in shame and spiritual disfigurement, but ""God can turn your battle scars into beauty marks"".I recommend Behind the Mask to everyone that has been faced with abuse and anyone that has ever been deceived in any way. This book will give you hope and help you to stand tall, look your abuser in the face and declare, No More!"
4,Great product,"I like these dispensers. They will be handy for formula for my infant or snacks for my toddler. The only thing that would be better is if the lids on the small openings were somehow attached to the containers then you wouldn't lose them. Other than that, they are a good product."
3,"Nice concept, but seems to be tough to use","We bought this with the intent of adding one or more to our diaper bag for travel snacks. The size of the containers are good and the idea of the side opening reduces the chance of accidental spills.My biggest problem is closing the containers. The side opens up to fill them and then it screws on. The side you screw on doesn't seem to fit the whole piece very well. I can hardly get the threads lined up. If I do and the threads are not lined up perfectly, the plastic will bend enough to pop off the side and I'll have to start again. I've gotten to the point where it is easier to just try and snap the side on instead of screwing it."
3,handy but...,"I had hoped that these would be simple like another brand I had purchased, but they're not. They don't screw together easy and the openings don't line up. Formula also gets trapped in the groove for the cap. I would have purchased another like the previous brand, but it was too late. Oh well. The price wasn't ridiculous so I'm OK with it not meeting my expectations."
3,Just ok,I liked the idea If you have to go out for about an hour and just need to bring one bottle that you could use one of these containers for formula. However the tops don't screw on very easily and it's really quite annoying. Also when They are separated i don't like that you can't stack them because the tops are curved. Anyone that has a baby knows How much baby crap there is so having the ability to stack these would be a SpaceSaver!!
2,RazPak,Great convenience for powdered formulas - it is now possible to get it all in the bottle. 5 stars.
4,Pros and Cons after 1 year of use.,"I have had this product for about a year now and I can say that it has its pros and cons. Pros: sturdy, convenient, never spills in diaper bag, can be separated in to one, two, or three units. Cons: Plastic is starting to wear, the ""plugs"" don't attach in anyway to the container, so I am always scared they will get lost or get choked on, in a rush the lids can be tricky to screw on (realign over and over again). Still, a better snack container than most that I have owned."
1,Not what I expected at all...,I never thought the blocks were as tiny as they are! Not something I'm even comfortable letting my 5 yr. old play with not to mention I have a 7 mo. old who just began crawling... Maybe I can re-gift them down the line.
5,This,This item arrived in time. It really explain what is in the bible.take your time and read it with your might.
5,Onitsuka Tiger Tai Chi,I got my order faster than I thought. It's very nice shoes my husband loves it. It would be great if we get the box. Highly recommend !
5,Another good Robyn Carr read,"I always enjoy her books and look for more, would recommend anything she writes to anyone who asks (and some who don't)."
5,A Meteorological Cult Classic,"I'm an earth science teacher and initially shied away from the mass market nature of this text, but I looked over a couple of pages at the pharmacy one afternoon and was hooked. A thorough and thoroughly engaging book about El Nino - everything you need to know. And believe me. YOU NEED TO KNOW."
5,Stunning Book,This is one for the collector. Contains beautiful illustrations by the late Dugald Stermer know for his beautifully rendered and painted botanical illustrations.
4,"Born to Win, Breed to Succeed","This is a MUST READ for every serious dog breeder. This lady knows her dogs, knows her breeding programs, and knows how to produce the best! I don't agree with everything she says, but her opinions are knowledgeable and well founded."
5,Oustanding book.,"My dad got an old, beat-up copy for me at a library sale and I liked it so much I thought I'd like to have a new, totally-intact copy and bought it off of Amazon. The author covers everything a beginner should know and be informed on if you want to become a dog trainer. She's a legend and it shows. The best part is that she doesn't throw a lot of scientific jargon at you and you don't have to understand population genetics, what alleles are or anything like that to pick up this book and get a ton out of it. Great job, Mrs. Craige."
2,"So much possibility, so little result","Disclaimer: I couldn't finish it.My son and I read about 1/2 this book before finally closing it for good. Perhaps that tells you all you need to know. We kept reading, wanting to like the book, wanting to see if SOMETHING was going to happen, anything. But chapter after chapter only got us more confused and frustrated. Even as we gave up, the action was picking up -- but too little, too late.There was a real sense of originatlity to this book, a sense of going where no kid's book had gone before. But in the end, all that originality lacked purpose -- original ideas need to point to something. This book had no point. But then, we only made it through half of it. Maybe your 9-year-old has more patience than mine. Check that: has more patience than me!!!"
2,A book I could definitely put down,"I selected this book because of the intriguing cover art and interesting summary. Unfortunately, plot developments that are probably meant to be mysterious just seem vague. I should have given it more of a chance but after listening to three CDs, I found that I simply didn't care about either the characters or the final outcome of the story."
5,The Navigator,I thought the book was great after I read it! If you have not read this book I suggest you read because it is really good.
1,NOT GOOD!!!!!!! :(,"Im 10 years old and the only reason that i read this book was because im in 5th grade and i have to make survivor or else i would go down a letter grade.The first time that i read the first few chapters i was SO BORED!!!! it came to the point of the whole book almost at the end.the back sort of seemed interesting but once i started to read i wasnt paying any attention to what i was reading.The last few pages i have to admit were a bit good,but it wasnt worth it reading the book."
1,A bit pop hip hop but a few nice songs.,I wasn't able to enjoy the cd as I received it damaged but in between gliches it appeared to be fun if not a bit soft core hip hop.
1,What The Hell????,"I have the first four seasons and season 5 volume 1..Since the Complete 5th season is cheaper than Season 5 Volume 2, I guess I will have to buy the Complete 5th season, and have a duplicate of the first half of season 5......sound complex, well hell yeah it is, why they didn't do it on way or the other is beyond me. You want to rip us of with the Vol I & Vol II BS fine, don't then offer the complete season for less than half....morons......I love the show and will be buying, but seriously Dennis, why do you treat your diehard fans like this????"
1,nonsense...,"vol 1 and vol 2 are individually more expensive than the entire set? wtf? i was buying for a friend, who loves the show, but this is just plain asinine. in order to correct the situation, i am considering the following:1. install torrent client2. locate torrent files3. download the shows4. burn to dual layer dvd5. give dvd to friendproblem solved. lesson learned by everyone. moving on."
4,Probably the last good season of this show...,"I've been a big fan of the show from the beginning so it's hard for me to admit, but this show has lost a lot of momentum. Season six was weak and rehashed a lot of the same old subject matter and the final season has been fragmented and uninteresting to say the least. While I am disappointed in the way the show has ended, up until that point it is quite good so I still recommend seasons one through five."
3,good series,"We really like the Rescue Me series. Denis Leary, while crass,does a great job in this series. The show begins to take on more of a political angle in this series and it does detract from some of the plot lines. Overall, good series, but realize has lots of vulgarity. Not for virgin ears. :)"
3,Great Packaging........Not,"I'll just add, hats off to the genius who designed the outer box. You pick it up, the two inner packs fall out the open bottom."
4,Season 5 - Solid,I really thought season 5 was one of the best so far. I loved 1 and 2 and thought 3 and 4 were weak but 5 rocks.I am glad I stuck with this show! Go Dennis and co.And I do not understand all the complaints about the release of the season in two halves for those who can not wait for the whole season to come out.Did anyone really think the whole season would never be released as a whole?Same with Glee right now. I am gonna wait until the whole season is released and will not buy season 1 part 1 now but if some people can not wait... then ya pay more. obviously.
1,Bad Marketing,Bad marketing on Sony Picture's part. First releasing the set in two separate volumes and then later releasing both volumes together for the same price as one separate volume.
2,No good quality,"The rifflers have nothing to do with those shown in the picture, the finishing of the tools is too coarse and you only scratch the wood instead of polish it."
3,It is what it is,Bought these for stone and plaster work. They are basic rifflers and are good for beginners to use. They're good
5,The best book ever!,"The book is so good!!! It's about two mice, the real Stilton and the fake Stilton battling against each other. One day real Stilton gets locked out in the cold and fake Stilton takes over his life. The next day real Stilton calls Thea, his sister, and Thea says, ""Unless you know what Aunt gave you on your birthday you can't talk to me.""The reasons I like this book are:1. It's funny and it's good for humorous people and children.2. It's kind of confusing but once you read on you'll get it. It's also kind of cool how every food and drink is made out of cheese. eg. cheese chews and cheese tea.3. It's very mysterious. I always think something bad is going to happen.Even though it's not a good bedtime story, this book is good entertainment! So I think If you like funny books you should give this one a try!!!(Review by Isabella)"
3,"Small Print, But Cute","My granddaughter is an avid reader so I introduced her to my old (first edition) Amazon Kindle. We picked out this title, downloaded it, and she was reading in minutes. She thought it was really cool! I guess I'll be needing a new Kindle. Notes on the product: The story is cute but the display is less than I expected. Normally, a Kindle title fills the screen with readable print. This title did not. It seemed as if the page presentations were PDF screen shots which resulted in the print being smaller than I found acceptable. My granddaughter's eyes are better than mine, though, so this was not a problem for her."
5,Wonderful fast service,The product came quickly and I received more than one calendar when I only purchased one. Bonus.The only thing I wish is that there was one more row for numbers but this is still an excellent product. Highly recommend it.
1,Cute and worthless,"Thought that buying a WMF product I was safe in purchasing quality. This is a poorly designed, poorly made piece of Chinese rubbish. Hard to use and eventually just came apart."
5,Usa Boxers,"This is one of many Boxers in my collection, and I get lots of compliments on it. Thank you very much!"
1,Waste of time and money,"Are you looking for a practice test that will provide an excellent representation of the types of questions you are sure to find on the PMP certification exam? THIS AIN'T IT. The questions here are just cute. The authors spent more time coming up with bizarre scenarios than they spent developing questions comparable to those on the PMP Exam. I was studying for the exam and was getting intimidated by these questions because I was answering over 50% wrong. I recently took (and passed) the exam and found those questions to be relatively simple and straighforward. Questions that you would expect in a real work environment. I wasted my money, a lot of time and confidence on this book. Focus on the PMBOK, PMP Challenge! (also an ESI text), diagramming methods and earned value and comm channel formulas."
1,Not worth your money,"I tried to use this book to study for the PMP exam. I wished I had put my money somewhere else. The other references I used were far more usefull including: the PMBOK, The Rita Mulcahy Exam Prep book, Kerzner's book and the Verma books. This one just frustrated me. The questions do not reflect the exam (at least not the exam I took)and are sometime too silly. I could ace the samples in Rita's book but scored 65-75% on the same area in this book. This one is not worth your money."
2,This is a OK book,"Hi PMP friends:I studied the PMBOK first and then use this book to TEST my knowledge and prepare for my PMP examknation which I am going to take in the middle of October/01.I think this book is OK. I wish they cover more on the NON-PMBOK material. Not 2 sure I can pass the exam just by using this book.Update: I just pass the PMP exam. I downgrade my rating on this book because it doesn't help 2 much in the actual exam.I want to order ""PMP EXAM PREP"" but it is not available until the end of October/01, i.e., AFTER my PMP examination.I can only wish myself good luck as there are so few PMP examination preparation material in the market, it makes the preparation really hard.Update: I just pass the PMP exam. This guide doesn't help a lot."
1,Disappointing Study Resource,"I did not find this study guide helpful at all. It merely presented terms to be familiar with for each knowledge area (without definitions or explanations as to why they're important) and sample exams. I grew increasingly frustrated with the exams because I was scoring significantly lower (10-20 points) that I was experiencing with all the other sample exams I was taking (e.g., Mulcahy and PMP Tools). The cute scenarios didn't bug me as much as the lack of valuable insight into how to improve my score on the exam. After a couple of chapters, I simply stopped using it. Having now taken and passed the exam with 30 points to spare, I can confidently say this book was a waste of money."
3,O Tannenbaum?,This book covers more than the Christmas tree's history and actually smothers it in much more focus on the pagan trappings of Christmas and its history.Just an intro...
4,Shows lots of streams,"The video is good in that is shows portions of a lot of Yellowstone streams, including a number of lesser known streams. So it satisfies one's curiosity about what those streams looks like. And of course the scenery is all very good. It also gives some good advice on how to fly fish different streams. My only complaint is that the 4 hour length is achieved mostly by a long video of maps at the end of each disk. You are better off consulting a map or atlas for that, not a video."
3,STORY WAS PREDICTABLE,I LIKE CLAIRE LORRIMER. THIS STORY WAS A LITTLE PREDICTABLE THOUGH. I WILL DEFINITELY READ MORE OF HER BOOKS THOUGH. SHE IS AN INTERESTING AUTHOR.
4,Good Family Movie,"Story- ASettting & Costumes- AActing- AI was attracted to this movie because of the cast. They didn't disappoint. They were all well chosen and did a good job. The story takes place on this odd estate with a lot of history. The house and grounds were lovely and did a good job of creating the WWII era in Britain as well as a more distant past. There are two stories here: family ties and a mystery. Both support each other and wrap up in a way that feels satisfying. If you are looking for a movie to watch with the kids, or if you are a bit of a kid yourself, you will like it. It has ghosts in it, but that's actually part of what makes it enjoyable."
4,"unique, touching story","great actors, interesting story exploring several issues of the time, definitely worth watching, nice dvd to watch while waiting for the next season of Downton Abbey"
3,Time to Time,Nice story with excellent acting and Maggie Smith. Can't get better than that! Nice location and good flip flop between era's
3,good movie,"Very good movie. Slow at first, but builds into a really good production. No spoilers from me, just watch this, especially if you are a fan of Maggie Smith. It will not disappoint!"
2,Not worth paying for !,"I wanted to like this movie and disregarded other ratings. I love Maggie Smith and liked the genre; however, this was a very poorly done movie from beginning to end."
2,Disappointing.,"This movie could have been so good, but the director really blew it. The pacing was terrible and the storytelling got rather tedious in parts. For the most part, the acting was very good. It is hard to believe that such a stellar cast was wasted on such a mediocre production."
1,Snoozer,"Expected to like this movie with such a stellar cast and interesting story. Didn't even finish it - the film looked very dated and unrealistic - (make up, set) - story didn't really draw me in - watch at your own peril."
2,Had great potential,"This could have been a great little film- great cast, good story, etc. But the timing was really off, and some of the acting was phony. Some of the move came across as silly. I love Julian Fellowes- not his best work. Too bad."
1,What a waste,"Great cast, but ultimately a cheesy and predictable film. I was taken in by Maggie Smith - sadly, even she could not redeem this film."
4,Different ghost story,"This movie has some really interesting twists and turns. There are ghosts, a young boy and Maggie Smith. The story is simple, but takes the viewer into interesting places as the boy explores the hidden nooks and crannies of an old manor house. The actors are all good in their roles. There is a second layer story involving the boy making contact with the ghosts, who really aren't as frightening as they are frightened. The movie has a heart-warming appeal."
5,Wonderful!,I really liked this movie! If you like movies set in this time period than this movie is for you!
5,Wonderful...love it!,"I'll be honest, I adore Maggie Smith, so I probably would have loved it just because she was in it, but the movie was very good. I truly enjoyed it. Maggie's co-star is a brilliant young actor. I've passed it around to all of my family. Definitely recommend this one."
2,drags on and on,"This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. As the previous reviewer said, it started out promising and then let us down. The story drags for almost 200 pages and then gets only semi-interesting when one of the bachelors finally finds his soul mate. And I'm going to add a spoiler just because this part just crawled under my skin. Cassie doesn't even get mad at her boyfriend when she finds him in bed with one of her friends. And doesn't even say two words to him when they talk about it later on. Maybe British women don't get mad at something like that. But, we American women do! Maybe she felt like it was over, but still. Readers need to get a more emotional response than that. Please don't read this book unless you want to be disappointed."
2,Not for outdoor use or to be used with pucks,I have 3 boys that play ice hockey. They may get a 1/2 summer out of shooting on this net. It is not a strong net.
1,part was defective when installed,INSTALLED PART. DID NOT PROPERLY. WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND FLUID WOULD NOT TURN OFF WHEN ACTIVATED. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. I WONT EVER GET THAT HOUR BACK OF MY LIFE.
2,disapointingly lacking,"I myself have attended the S.A.F.E program and was excited to hear that Karen and Wendy had written this book. I was sincerely hoping that there were some questions answered in there that were dodged while I was in treatment there. The first and most major was the question of success rates of the program. This question was asked of them many times and went unanswered.I do know that there are clients/patients that go away from there helped, at the same time I've seen many go away more confused and self-injurious. Though this book seems to be well written in form and grammar, the content seems to fit an agenda. My question is whether that agenda is in the interest of finances or the people who suffer from this disorder. It just seemed like a well planned,gramatically correct visitors brochure."
4,A helpful guide to a treatment resistant disorder.,I recently came upon this book by way of recommendation. I have found it very useful in my practice of working with those who have found a powerful means of expressing and coping with their pain. It helps those who self-harm in a very understandable way.
4,"Very Good, but prolly not for everyone","I enjoyed this book, and found their methodology interesting. I also saw some of where I was heading described. I saw things I didn't like. I have been SI free for 13 days now. Thank you for writing a great book. It gave me hope, courage, and a window of opportunity."
1,Just do not work,"I have these in same room with transmitter, and have tried all ways of tuning/locating. When they work, very good, but they will not stay tuned on same program. Emit loads of static and whistles. Will only tune with volume at max on tv. Upstairs I have ARs & they work wondorously, even on low TV volume. The ARs also emit a wider sound spectrum. These RCAs are not as good as the speakers that came with my PC."
3,This is a decent product!,I bought a refurbed pair from eBay. I experienced no static issuesfrom any outlet in the house. Sound quality is OK and is betterthan wireless speakers I have tried.
4,I Like These Speakers!,"I have several different models of wireless speakers. I am an artist and I must have the proper atmosphere to create art, so I have wireless speakers all over my home by Acoustic Research, RadioShack (RCA), and ""Velocity"". The only other wireless speakers that are just a little better are also RCA but they were manufactured for RadioShack and are no longer available. The WSP250s are fine, 4 and 1/2 stars. There is some noise sometimes in the background, requiring me to switch channels in the back of the unit. Not a big problem, but, again, the RadioShack model requires zero adjustment and has a fuller sound. The WSP250s can use a tighter bass, but they sound crisp and clear. I wonder why these speakers don't sell more than they do. They work very well. They are big and I wouldn't hang them on a wall. The phased locked loop circuitry works well, and the power is adequate. Highly recommended."
4,Decent wireless speakers,"These are decent wireless speakers, the sound quality is obviously sub-par but they have very good range in my house and always work. Besides, the range/wattage/sound for under $200 is actually a pretty good deal. Plus you can buy an option internal battery for each speaker which makes them totally wireless which is super nice."
4,Good video,The guy goes over everything pretty well and in detail. The one annoying thing is that sometimes he has customized guns in there that have different set ups from a normal Marlin. I think he should just have stock factory guns for showing the disassembly etc. The video doesnt have chapter selections either so you have to skip and fast forward around to get to the part you want to know about.If you have problems taking the rifle apart and putting back together for just cleaning and maintenace you can find videos on [...] that will show you the basics and maybe save you the $35 cost of this video. I have a Marlin 336 and Marlin 1895G and this video helped me learn the parts of the guns better but a lot of it is more than I really needed to know for just cleaning.
3,Decent solo release,"Gavin Harrison is currently one of rock music's elite drummers, but before joining Porcupine Tree, he released this jazzy solo disc in 1997. Harrison co-wrote most songs with help from Gary Sanctuary (keys) and Mick Karn (bass). Keyboard maestro Dave Stewart collaborates on two songs and Jakko Jakszyk (keys) on one.This is not a drum shred album, but solid, groove oriented material that varies from fusion on ""Aim"", funk on ""Dog Day"", and softer melodies like ""A Place to Stay"" and ""Witness"". There are scat type vocals on three songs and it's hard to digest on ""Dearest Blood"", very whiny. The inclusion of the Sarangi (an Indian bowed string instrument that sounds like a cross between a sitar and a violin) on several tunes is a nice change of pace that sounds cool. If you're a huge Gavin fan I'm sure you'll get this, if it's not out of print, but if you like this style of music (contemporary jazz) there are many artists out there just as good that won't break the bank."
5,Excellent Resource,"This book is full of great information for the dedicated aquarium hobbyist. However, it can be a bit technically taxing for a sit down read or if you are just entering into the hobby. Even still, it is worth the effort to read as it contains priceless information from a well-known expert on fish keeping including practical solutions to keep fish not only alive, but healthy. Read this book and learn how to make your aquarium inhabitants thrive."
5,Time savings & Money savings for a quality vacation,"I shared this book and its ""Fun 'N Food"" card with friends visiting me in Hawaii. It saved them quite a bit of money and guided them to all the best places for the things they wanted to do. They were thrilled that I gave this to them. I'm making it a staple item for all of my visiting friends and family, in fact I'm ordering another to have for my next guest! Excellent source!"
4,NYC 40's,"Like other books in the series, captures a moment that has been lost as the world changes! Great piece for those who were there or are there now."
5,Another Book Worth the Price,Please see my review for the 1930's book by the same photographer. It is just a continuation of a work well begun by this talented lady photographer. I am just thankful that these books have been reprinted without being changed except for possible correction of typographical errors.
2,Book designed for mediocraty,"While the cover might lead you to believe that the artist of the book is competent, his disproportioned and scratchy sketches are not notable enough to buy a book of and certainly not something you want in your repetoir of skills. His use of proportions is just incorrect.This book is not a usable source any type of academic art study. The artist of this book needs to take some art classes badly.Don't waste your money if you want a good book to learn how to draw use better and more accurate references that are out there because there are plenty."
3,Basic slack key performance,A recognized master of slack key. If you are a fan you should sdd this to your library.
5,What a back saver!,My Mom bought this for her house and it is wonderful I think I am going to trade her for mine. If you are going to use the changing table it is great the extra height really saves your back. Also that you have area to put the wipes and other changing needs. And I loved that the bassinet area is the whole width vs. only half as mine (Jeep Sahara Limited XT). Don't get me wrong I like mine a lot but I love this one. This is a really well designed and thought out product.
4,Love it!!,"We use this Pack 'n' Play as a bassinet for our 8-week old and it is great! During nap time, I turn on the vibration and nature sounds and she falls asleep within minutes. And I love that it has a timer you can set so you don't waste batteries if you know your little one will be asleep in just a few minutes. It was extremely simple to set up - I did it on my first day home from the hospital and it took about 10 minutes.I don't really use the changing table part because the plastic is too cold - it's easier to just do changes on the bed or floor at night. Also, the bear mobile is cute and my daughter likes to stare up at it, but it doesn't turn on its own so I'm not really sure if many people would find that item useful."
1,BEWARE,"I loved this playard when I purchased it, but then I tried to travel with it and it is impossible to breakdown. The changer is nice when in use, but you simply can not travel with it. In fact, it will not even fit in the carry bag! Look elsewhere."
5,Love this pack and play,"I wasn't sure how much I would use this, but because we live in a townhouse, we use it ALL the time. For us, it has definitely paid for itself in the first few weeks alone.We like that the changing table is higher than on other models where the changing area rests on the bassinet - my husband is a tall man and this is easier on his back.We love the bears - we don't use them as a mobile however. We watch for them shaking as a warning sign that the baby is waking up and moving!"
4,Pack - N - Play,"Has all the bells and whistles. Only complaint is it is too wide to take from room to room w/o collapsing the entire thing to get through doorways. I bought this for my first child, will make sure to measure next time."
3,MORE THAN YOU NEED,"This is an extra sleeping space. We had a basic pack n play for our first child and it worked great! We especially liked the dark color for naps away from home. We received this as a gift for our second child and ohmygosh, there is so mush extra stuff that we never use. Color is bright and sunny, not great for naps, the mobile is nice by extraneous, as is the changing table. the sun shade is nice. Overall, a very nice gift, but not worth the extra expense. Go basic, the regular oack n play is perfect for travel and naps!"
1,it really is flimsy,"I have found this to be the most impractical pack and play yet. I am the mother of five children under 6 and have three different versions for my moms house, my house and a vacation home. I am sorry I spent the extra money on this. It wobbles and truly is not good for sleeping. Wish I could return it."
4,Love it!!!,"This was my first playpen that I ever owned. I did not have one for my first son. I have to say that I have no idea what I would have done without it. I love the fact that the changing area is attached to the playpen. Even though I live in an apartment, I use this in my livingroom. Its nice to have all the diapers, wipes and extras in one place when they are needed. The music/light/vibrating feature is good also.The one down fall is the mobile. Its horrible and boring. (thats why I did not give it 5 stars)"
5,"A ""Must Read"" even if you don't own a business...","I've been working with Doug for nearly a year, using his ""Clients Forever"" process in my business. To say my business and my life have been transformed would be an understatement! Doug is a dynamic person and fabulous coach, and I wasn't sure a book would do his philosophy justice, but it really does. It is written in an easy to understand, conversational way that makes you feel like he is in the room coaching you. The exercises are an absolute must, and fortunately they are fun to do. You'll come away from them with a whole new way of looking at your life, as well as your customers and your business. I've gone through them with my entire staff, and each and every person felt like they had gotten more out of those few, simple exercises than any other training we had ever done in the shop. This is the first ""business"" book I've ever read that made me feel sad I'd come to the end of it...can't wait for the sequel!"
4,"My Life, My Work, My Relationships","Clients Forever not only gave me an entirely new way to interact with my clients, it also gave me a new way to interact with myself. The exercises helped me to take a close look at how & why I behave the way I do and how that behavior affects the way I do business. I feel rewarded by the personal development that I've made as a result of reading the book and that was totally unexpected. I look at my clients in a whole different light now. My life, my work and my relationships have all improved and I look forward to implementing what I've learned.The book was pyschologically intriguing and fun to read at the same time. The authors gave it a down to earth approach with a true humanistic appeal. I highly recommend it.I'm looking forward to seeing Doug talk in person and to find out more about his personal coaching programs."
1,Booooooooooring,"this DVD can be sumed in one word,snorrrrrrrrrrrrre.I had to force my eyes open just to make it through the first scene.And why call it blood sister of ""LESBIAN"" sin when there is no one lesbain scene except when sister anger kissed the other girl??? I forgot her name???? any way DON'T BUY THIS DVD."
4,interesting and challenging weird short stories,"an interesting collection of short fiction with an emphasis on the weird. overall thought provoking and interesting, all the stories are worth reading and the title story is excellent. the collection would be worth the money for this tale alone."
4,A very interesting book on this topic,"The text is quite advanced but my 12-year-old granddaughter was enthralled with this book, which she used as a reference for a 6th grade report. Nice pictures!"
2,Not worth the money!,"The pocket chart itself it really nice and seems durable. But the cards are a complete waste. First, they are paper thin and without laminating they would not last long. Second, the font for the numbers is horrible and the six's and nine's look the same. Not good for teaching little kids... and Third, the numbers are colored all crazy and confusing and really not needed. I had a pocket chart for my kids at home and the numbers were made on hard board and with good font so I took them into my class."
1,One Star For Sheer Greed...,"Shame On Those That Desire OVER $700. For ONE DVD! How ""Shameless"" Can This Be? Amazon Please Reconsider This Cost! The Same w/""Lauduree"" Until ""Powers That Be"" Reduced Cost To A ""Normal"" Fee.I Could NEVER PAY ALMOST $800. And I Refuse! Yes, I Enjoy Miss.Melissa D'Arabian's Cuisine & Programme. Highly Suggest Her Chicken Dish~ 'Marengo Tango' That She Believes Helped Her Win ""Next Food Network Star"". I Agree It IS Deliciious!As For This Absurdity~No Thanks Amazon This Time..."
3,Somewhat pleased....,"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to ""real"" coilovers. Having said that, the package arrived without the spanner wrench to adjust the ride height of the shocks. I called Fabtech directly and they sent me another one, but made me jump through a few hoops to prove that I actually ordered a kit and was not just trying to score a free wrench. 2/5 for customer service on their end. The stickers they sent in the package were both damaged as well. Nothing says good quality in advertising like poorly made stickers.As far as ride quality, there is NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE between these and general replacement struts. I have had Monroe Sensa-trac, and the stock Blisteins on this truck and these do not perform any better than those do. Having said that, the Monroe struts are the cheapest... I would go with those."
5,Romance Junkie,"This book was awesome, I started reading it around midnight and that was a huge mistake because I couldn't put it down. Raphael ""Rafe"" to his friends was the perfect alpha male, handsome, rich, rags to riches kind of guy. The best part was Carin because she was the sexy, good looking, tough talking New Yorker...actually she could have been from anywhere in the USA. She was not the lame, weepy, no back bone women that most authors' like to write about. She was every one of us and I LOVED her character. Rafe being Brazilian and Carin from the USA was Latin macho way vs tough USA female...They were perfect together and it had a wonderful ending. I recommend this book highly and I will save it on my kindle forever and will read it again in the future."
2,Not much Love shared,"I also really wanted to like this book, it was readable, but I really didn't care for or empathize with either the H or the h.Both Rafe and Carin behaved badly. He expects her to comply with his every demand and basically acts like a brute. She acted immaturely and deliberately provokes him, then acts like the wronged party.At a time when Carin, a new mother, would be taking comfort in her much wanted/loved baby the child, Amy, isn't mentioned for a large chunk of the book.It was hard to believe that they loved each other and that their love would last."
5,Sandra Marton comes through again!,This is a really good one in the continuing saga of the Barons.It's a wonderful love story that captures the essence of true love between two strong characters. You won't want to put it down till it's done....the story is that compelling.Sandra struck gold here...this will be a worthy addition to your library...guaranteed
1,Extremely disappointing,"This product, while it worked, failed to reduce the numbers of black flies in my yard. I still had to douse myself with deet to avoid being bitten. After 10 days from new, the gas flame went out. I tried changing the gas tank, cleaned the unit as instructed by the manufacturer, but still no results. I have stopped trying to make it work. Save your money."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"This is NOT the ""original"" spaghetti as pictured. It is the ""Italian"" Syle Spaghetti. Big Difference in taste! YUCK! They should have stuck with the original!"
3,Not as good as the original,"We bought this because there isn't Hamburger helper spaghetti in the stores To our dismay it was ""Italian"" I wonder why they mess with a good thing."
1,Does not work for i760. Inch too short!!!!!!!!,Does not work for i760. Inch too short!!!!!!!!I bought 2. Cost too much to return... Waste of money. Shipping too high.
5,Not super-fidelity...but works great.,Plug it in...use the RCA jacks to the transmitter unit...Plug directly into your speaker jacks on your computer...I bought a SPLITTER for this smaller stereo-headphone-jack on my computer...allowing me to use one side for continued use of my desktop speakers...and the other split side...to the transmitter that sends the signal to the enclosed 2 speakers. Some periodic reception problems.....but ok once tweaked. I think these are awesome for outside and downstairs listening from your computer. The only drawback is you have to turn each speaker on seperately...BUT they both have their own plugs built in...I honestly had this up and running in less than 10 minutes.
3,It's just ok.,"I bought this keyboard to replace a failed keyboard in a data center. I thought it would be more useable and it is, but not by much. The keys are still just a tiny bit too small to type on comfortably. The trackball takes some getting used to. I use a Logitech TrackMan on my desk so I thought it would be an easy transition but the feel is completely different.It does feel like a high quality product that probably won't fail as quickly as the keyboard that it replaces."
4,a bit different,"This one's a bit different because Miss Silver is there before anyone turns up dead, a bit less than 1/4 way into the book. She is a houseguest at the Priory when the assorted romantically involved young people arrive. The Priory is, oddly enough, the never-before-seen property of one of these. In a house full of cousins and couples, how long can it be before someone gets murdered over jealousies old and new?"
2,Not if you want a real challenge,"I like Kimberly Spreen and have worked out with her before. I also enjoy other videos in the Self magazine series. However, if you're looking for a workout that will get your heart pumpinig and your muscles really working, this one isn't for you. I felt like the routine spent way too much time with simple hip-rotations and slow step-touches to be an effective workout. I felt like my time was being wasted more than once during this 49-minute video. On a positive note, this might be a good workout for someone who's looking to get some light activity in their day instead of sitting on the couch. Kimberly has a great attitude, and the outside setting is pretty. It's just hard to recommend this to intermediate/advanced exercisers."
4,Love it !,The instructor has a great personality and keeps you motivated. This dvd is good for beginners to intermediate level. I enjoyed the dance moves and the music is pretty good.
1,Dance your way bored.,"I thought that this would be a good way to get into shape, but I couldn't be more wrong. It is very slow paced, and when you are trying to follow along, they switch moves before telling you what they're doing, so you can't really follow. I would not recommend this tape to anyone."
5,water fountain,The fountain was just what i needed. It gives a steady stream of trickling water for my cat. She gets fresh flowing water whenever she wants and I stoped worrying about if she was getting enough water. It was well worth the $40 and I've told my friends to get them for their pets.
5,my kitty loves this,the moving water fasinates her and she spends more time drinking.... it's great. And the extra capacity jar works great when we are away.
3,Not what I expected,"It's been a couple of days since I finished reading this book and I still can't decide if I liked it or not. I've read a couple of other books by Melanie Schuster and I liked this one the least. It's not that the book is bad, but the main characters were just too good to be true. I found myself more interested in what was going on between Andrew and Renee that Bennie and Clay. For most of the book, Bennie and Clay were pretty much happy with each other and it seemed like all of the conflict and drama was saved until almost the very end and then it was resolved pretty easily. I don't know, it was just meh, IMO. I am curious about that Dr. John guy, so I hope that more of the books in the series are made available for Kindle."
4,Already bought the next book.,"Melanie Schuster is a very throw writer. She leaves nothing out. She could have ended the book/story several times but she answers the question every romance read asks, what happens after the ""I DO's"". I know when I really like a book I often continue the store for myself.I really loved Bennie. She is the true meaning of stand by your man. She is also her own person. Her father is a true A** but his love is true no matter how twisted. I'm from a very large family (12 kids); the book had me missing them all.I will share this book with my book club.The only negative for me is that it went on and on. A bit to worded. She did not have to give every little detail.However I am starting the next book tonight.P.S. I knew Dr. John was Big Benny's son. My mother says when you point one finger @ someone 3 more are pointing back @ you. I hope Melanie talks about it in the next book."
1,Highly Disappointed,"This book was highly disappointing. I bought the whole series the other day, because I can read these books in one day. I returned them all. Her story is really slow, it does not catch your attention. On top of that, the grammar is awful. I will never by another book by her."
3,Amazing revisit,"I read this book years ago and it's still as good as it was when I first read. The story will have you laughing, crying, and laughing again. The characters are well developed. This is a MUST READ!!!"
2,"great editorial, bad biography, uninspired",I bought this to introduce the globe trotters to my 8 year old son. We were both bored to tears. It is mostly editorial by famous people associated with the globe trotters. Very little time spent on filming them in action. And the clips shown are very short. You walk away understanding the racial component and who did not get along with who. It would have been nice to see what the globe trotters are famous for. Meadowlark Lemon is breif and at the very end. If you are looking for editorials about the globe trotters this is it. If you are looking to see the globe trotters doing there thing skip this one.
3,this was okay,"I had hoped to see a bit more tricks but it did not show much, good history lesson though. everything was okay, shipping, price, dvd,"
2,Still tweezing/shaving,It's been over 8 weeks since I started using this product for my chin hair....Still doing too much tweezing and recently went back to shaving. It ain't working for me. Next stop...LASER TREATMENTS.
1,ZERO STARS - WASTE OF MONEY,I purchased Kalo direct and used Kalo correctly and faithfully for two years. They said it 'takes time.' I saw absolutely no improvement. I do not recommend this product.
1,doesn't work,"i've been trying this for months, and it doesn't work. I've given up. Try the tria laser thing. This works!! it's very expensive, but worth every penny! I used to have to shave every single day. not anymore! No thanks to this product"
1,Not a good deal,"This is not a good deal as you can order the 4 oz spray for $22.45 and the 2 oz lotion for 29.99 from the same vendor. That's nearly $20 less from this combo deal, which contains the same items, am I missing something?I've used this product before, and I can't say if it did anything for me permanently. But it did seem to reduce the ingrown hair problem a bit. And I followed instructions to the ""t"". I'm curious if anyone else at all, in the world, is using this?"
2,Cheaper than it looks,"This trash can is much less quality than it looks. I purchased it for my bedroom. The sway part at the top is too large for the hole and frequently sticks, making it extra work to throw your trash away. Also, the size seems much bigger online. Once a few tiems are in it, it's full (the top swings through so if anything is in it's way you can't put any more trash in it). Recommend a different product for this use."
2,Poor packaging,"Amazon packed this in a flimsy box, and while shipping the trash-bin was squeezed into oval shape while the the ""top"" remained round and so won't fit. Otherwise, it looks nice."
2,Not as good as I was hoping for.,"Received the trash can about a week or so after the order was placed. When I opened it, there was no lid so I had to return it and wait for a replacement. When I received that one, both pieces were there, but the color wasn't as described. Since I was using it for kitty litter room, I wasn't too worried about it. After washing it and putting a liner in it, I started using it. The lid will not stay on. Every time I try to throw the litter in it, the lid either tilts off or falls off completely. I've tried putting two bags in the can to make the lid tighter, which seemed to help a little, but the lid still tilts off. Which, of course, makes a mess when I try to put the litter in it. I'll use this until I can find something better that is affordable."
3,Pretty but not very functional,"I wanted a cat-resistant wastebasket that was attractive enough to keep in my living room. This looks great, and it's kept my kittens off so far because every time they touch it, it falls over and the lid pops off, startling them so that they run away. This indirectly deterrent effect can't last much longer, unfortunately.As others have mentioned, the can is lightweight and top-heavy, and the lid is held on only by gravity. So if the can tips, everything ends up spilling out. If you live in a pet-free household where gravity is especially strong, this may be the trash can for you. Otherwise, I recommend that you seek something sturdier."
2,Not so good,When i first got them I was pleased but after one day working in the yard one of the fingers stitching came out. I resowed it but it split in other places. Poor manufacturing.
4,Great glove,"These are the other gloves I used when doubling up on protection for my hardwood sanding project. Very comfortable, worked great with the other gloves, oversized the other pair to fit over these so I could wear both at the same time to keep from damaging my hands."
5,INCREDIBLE,"I love instructor Violet Zaki, she is really one big profesionalist. I like her workouts. She knows what she teach us and what's really great it helps."
2,Didn't Meet Expectations,"I ordered this after reading the great reviews and also because I wanted something specifically to work my legs. Unfortunately, I found it quite boring. Though lots of repititions can be key to success with working the legs, I have done other with a few less repititions and significantly more of a burn. Did end up sweating a bit and the instructor is pretty cute with her Australian accent, but my favorite strength and cardio workout video remains Cindy Crawford's Next Challenge Workout."
2,Not the greatest,"Although this workout has a great outdoor setting, it was far from being one of my favorite workouts. The instructor wasn't very likeable and the workout wasn't very intense. It includes a lot of moves requiring you to do a significant amount of balancing (The instructor, in fact, keeps bringing this to your attention throughout the workout - telling you that if you lose your balance to keep trying it. Unfortunately, if you frequently lose your balance, you also lose the benefit of the exercise.) I made through about 25-30 minute of this dvd and then gave up on it. The next day I didn't even feel anything from it, whereas just 10 minutes of some of ""the 10 minutes solution"" segments were far more effective. I'd recommend one of those instead."
1,Is she kidding?,"The excersices are good for developing legs but, seriously...sexy? Those are the worst I have ever seen. I would NOT want my legs to look like that. Check out Jillian' Michaels' stuff, it's much better."
4,Pocket Chart Stand,I was very pleased to receive this item so promptly. The product arrived well packaged. My only dissatisfaction is with the wheels they are very difficult to insert.
2,weekend mechanic,Not bad. Larger than my GM dealer has. Unfortunately jamed on me and had to be cut off by GM dealer. They had to reassemble the truck for me. Amazon replaced it and the GM dealer and I are going to try again to make it work.
2,Does not work for 1997 S-10 ZR2,"Good quality tool, seemed well-machined and coated.It would have done the job, but there was no way it would work on my 1997 S-10 with the factory ZR2 suspension. The Lower nub was off the hole by a 1/4"" and would pop out of place after any tightening. Flipping the ""C"" around so it attached from the other side was impossible due to the welded frame member in the way.This tool isn't made to the J-36202 specification as far as I can tell, but a different one. I would guess it only works on J-42393 spec. trucks which are K35 chassis."
2,Broken 1/2 way through,Bought this tool to use on my new truck and it broke 1/2 way through the job. Construction seems to be a little cheap.
3,otc 7822a gm torsion bar unloading tool,this tool worked on my 2001 silverado 2500 hd pickup just as described however after after removing and reinstalling both sides the threads on the screw have started to streach leaving me to believe that it is a one job throw away tool
5,"very,very nice",this is a wonderful cd-g for anyone into karaoke.you would almost believe that neil diamond's band recorded the background music...can't go wrong with this one
4,Comfortable & effective wrist support!,"After using the computer to draft 10 hours per day for 20 years I've used many different types of wrist supports, but these are my favorite. They are comfortable and easy to put on which means I actually use them. I feel correct ergonomics has helped me avoid the wrist surgery that many of my friends have had."
4,Great for computer work,"Well everyone else seemed to have an easy time adapting to this. It is taking me more time. This brace feels awkward unless I am using a mouse or kb. Works well with them. For everyday use around the house, not for me."
3,Comfortable but awkward.,"This item feels comfortable and relieves some of the wrist strain but it is awkward to use. It interferes with mouse movement. It is great is all you have to do is type. But is you are doing a lot of document editing and have to move between the mouse and keyboard, it gets in the way."
3,Velcro is too strong,"I thought the item was going to go farther down my arm, toward the elbow, and the velcro is so tight/strong that I have a difficult time undoing it when I want to remove the support. This is unfortunate for me ... and I'm only 54."
1,didn't like it,I didn't feel like it was something that would help with the pain while I was typing and writing at work.
2,Didn't stay in place.,This didn't stay in place and allowed too much movement of my wrist to do me any good. It is in a drawer not being used. Waste of my money.
5,Best wrist support ever!,"I've always had issues with pain that is probably Carpal Tunnel. It affects my right wrist and is probably from typing for years and now because of texting. I had a baby last December and ever since carrying him around and also working on my laptop every day, my wrist is always tingling and hurts. I bought this Carpal Mate in beige a few months ago and it helped right away. I am able to type with no problem and it makes the pain and tingling stop. Even if my wrist was hurting in the morning, as soon as I put the support on and type for hours, my hand feels completely normal after I take it off. I just bought one for my dad and hope it works for him just as well as it does for me."
1,No relieve at all,I bought this product hoping it would at least relieve my wrist pain but its only making it worse. I've been wearing the brace all day and I keep adjusting it to see if it helps but noooo. It is so uncomfortable to wear.
1,"If I could rate lower than one star, I would...","The only thing I can imagine these being good for is at a desk job in lieu of a wrist rest. I wore for about ten minutes at my desk then up and about a bit; my wrists were seriously hurting by the time I gave up and took them off and back in the box! They did not support my wrists AT ALL no matter where I placed the wrist strap or how tight or loose I made it. If the heel of my hand was resting in the support, my wrist was actually bent DOWN, putting a ton of pressure on the very area that is damaged in the first place. Maybe if I had thicker hands, these would have worked or if I was just looking for something to support my wrists when they were resting on my desk but a sent these back QUICK."
4,"simple, cheap and slick","These things fit in oar locks and have a tiny mounting bracket. The bracket will go on my powerboat, I'll use the rodholder in the oarlock of my Livingston, so I'll use this inexpensive item on both boats. Folds flat to fit in my tackle box.I don't know if it would handle anything too large, but as my title says, simple, cheap and slick."
5,Senior Dog Loves DogSure,"A friend recommended DogSure for my Senior dog who is having trouble eating. DogSure has helped to improve his appetite and seems to have given him more energy. He loves the taste and a can last about 3 helpings because I only give him a third of the can at a time about every other day. I see an improvement in his weight, appetite, and energy from using DogSure."
4,Good read,"Once I began reading this novel, I couldn't put it down!Well written, with colorful descriptions that place you in a different, exotic world. Yet a world with real characters and real feelings.This intriguing historical romance takes place in Russia, where young Anna Stepanovna Crispin rashly marries Gregory Gadiani, a nobleman. One day, her husband walks out on her. Alone in St. Petersburg, Anna receives a letter from him, urging her to follow him to Kumari. The difficult journey to Kumari is beset with turmoil. She meets Paul Kuragin, who helps her on her journey. Only towards the end does she find out the truth about Gregory and Paul, and her feelings about them both, and chooses between the two."
4,good but glossed over,"Conducted by Kabalevsky himself, this is the definitive recording of his playful yet insightful Piano Concerto No. 3, played by Emil Gilels. However, the tempo is much too fast for Gilels to ever catch himself, take a breath, and begin to play with true feeling, giving the recording a glossy feeling, lacking any true depth, except for the beginning of the second movement."
3,Will all the horny Bolsheviks please stand up ...,"A good book by Natasha Rostova but not great at with 'Tea and Spices' and 'The Naked Truth' which I felt were true erotic masterpieces.In Captivation, our heroine, Katya, although a very sexual person was just that, sexual and not erotic. The impression that this reader got was that Katya came from a wealthy family, friends of the zars' and as such was pretty uptight repetedly thinking that she is too high in society to be used and abused by many of the soldiers and officers in this book. I guess the only time that I felt she really let her sensuality show when she fondles a young soldier on a train trip early in the book. Unfortunately that feeling and atmosphere did not continue.Now the book may not be a Dr. Zivago in its description of the conflict and revolution in Russia but we do get and idea of the times and the people...If you like period piece erotica with empasis on the period piece part then you should probably enjoy this book ...."
3,Decent,"I love historical fiction set in Russia. This book was ok, not as descriptive as I would have liked but a satisfying and pretty good read."
4,Pretty good of this type,"I could have done without the gypsy threesome, but otherwise it was exciting and well-written, with a happy ending. Overall a satisfying read."
1,Item never received,"Unfortunately, I never received this item and am still trying to find a way to get through to Amazon. I used this item before and loved them. I ordered this item at the end on November and still to this date have not gotten it. Tracking still shows departed Hebron, Ky."
3,challeging,"My children and I bought this for my husband who was very excited in receiving it. The instuctions stated that it would take 30 min. to put together. This has not turned out as stated. It took a long time just to be able to identify the different pieces. The directions neglected to name each item, and since we are new at this and not familiar with everything it took some guess work. Then my husband found that the instructions stated one thing but the picture showed something else. A telephone call to the company helped. After continuing to install some more of the pieces he found that one of them was incorrect. Again another call to the company who then was to send the correct part. After waiting for delivery we found they had sent the wrong size part. Another call etc. he finally when to a store to try and puchase the part that was the correct size. We still have not competed putting it together. Hopefully when time permits, all will go smoothly. We Hope!"
5,Great scope!!!,"This is a wonderful starter scope. The only problem I have had is my bright surrounding and getting used to adjusting the EQ mound. I bought this for my fiance's birthday and we are both left handed, so we want to do everything the ""other way""...lol. Everything viewed through the scope is upside down and turned 180 degrees. Which adds to the lefty confusion. Over time you get used to it and so far we have seen awesome views of the full moon. Jupiter was visible even with all the bright lights. The cloud bands and all 4 moons were seen easily. We were able to get some great photos of the moon, but the barlow lens is needed for a closer view and better pics of Jupiter. We also purchased a barlow lens, color filters, camera mount & bag so the scope can be carried with ease. We have not had the chance to use these accessories yet because of the weather, but we can not wait!"
2,You get what you pay for,"This fireplace screen was ordered for my parents as a replacement for one lost in Hurricane Ike. Since money is in short supply after replacing their house and possessions, they went with an inexpensive screen. They were disappointed by the quality - it is very lightweight and flimsy, and was tricky to get properly balanced on their hearth. However, since they were really only looking for something to break up the gaping maw of their fireplace, they elected to keep it."
4,screens,"I ordered these to keep out dogs from getting to the stereo speaker, and maybe chewing them. They are attractive and light weight, you don't really see them because of the color. Great value."
5,fire place screen,"This is a no frills light duty screen that is what it says it is. Built well, looks good, and sturdy for it's weight. A good buy for the price."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this for the purpose of keeping my cats out of the fireplace. It was either this or a baby gate. This looks better. It does the job. Is it light weight, yes. Can you bend it with your bare hands, yes. Does it look descent,yes. Are my cats walking on my white furniture with black paws? No. It was $25. Not $225."
2,Not that great for the price,"Wasn't that impressed with this. Needed to use it to keep my 1 year old from the fireplace and its so light, it can easily be knocked over by a 1 year old just pushing on it. Wish I'd of just put my money towards something more sturdy, even if I had to pay a little more. Plus it was dented in a couple spots, but that might have just been due to poor handling during shipping. So if your just looking for something really light and not to keep toddlers out, this would work fine. As long as it doesn't get dented on the way to you."
2,Too much enterprise manager,If you want to learn how to do things with Enterprise Manager it's great. However is has severe shortcomings on replication and full text search. Most of the info you need to pass their sample tests and exams require other documentation. The best book for that is Books Online or MS SQL Training Kit.
3,Good Movie If You Have Nothing Else To Do,This is a good movie that has nothing really to be remembered for. It is kind of unrealistic but makes you think about the future.
2,Husband Gerald Brenan would have done better,"For anyone interested in the experience of an expatriate in a Spanish village for a short time after the start of the civil war this book is OK, as long as we note there were many thousands of villages or pueblos across Spain, the war straddled the whole country, and the writer left for safety only a few months after the war started. notably before Franco's Nationalists took nearly Malaga and commenced an enormous slaughter of their republican enemies, the Loyalists, in early 1937; an event about which there is not a word. There is equally strong praise for the things the auther was pleased by and condemnation of the others. The excessiveness of both put me off. The writing is most moving in parts, but the work is unstrucutured. The author was really a poet, and it tells. The works of her esteemed husband,commencing with The Spanish Labyrinth, are a far better investment of time and money."
3,i guess its working,"I am using this product since about a month. I don't see significant changes, but yes my abdomen skin is better than it was immediately after delivery."
2,Opened/damaged packaging,"I had read a number of good reviews about this product, but when it arrived from this seller it had clearly been opened and the box was all mashed up. I haven't decided if I want to even bother trying to return it. I would recommend finding this item on sale somewhere else."
3,Damaged package,No problem with mustela staff but i do not recommend this seller since the package (also the protection seal) was torn and the pump of the gel is broken. The product does not seem new or at least to be well stored.
1,poor quality,"The 1st time I tried to use the charger, the end that goes into the motor vehicle fell apart & pieces were lost in my car."
3,Nice design but some flaws,"I just got it and started using it. It seems to be helping, but I'll have to give it more time.The brace is comfortable and yet, keeps my hand locked in position. The one issue I have is that it's velcro based and the straps are very long. The top strap got caught on the inside of the brace once and that is pure cotton. When I pulled the strap away, it yanked a bunch of cotton away as well as ripped out some of the stitching!So, the whoever designed this wasn't thinking about long term durability."
5,Great Album.,"This was the first Paul Clark album to feature Phil Keaggy on guitar and he really makes this album first rate.. Phil pulls out all the stops and displays his mastery of various techniques including volume swells, muting, sweep-picking before it was called that, and many other techniques- even beautiful classical guitar-playing that will delight the listener. . Paul's singing is good and his song-writing is even better. Very enjoyable. I saw these artists in concert and listened to them incessantly - so I admit to nostalgia, but I think many will enjoy this album on its own merits."
4,Range not as great as expected,I bought this set and 3 extra hand sets. Its great to be able to call each child via intercom instead of shouting out for them..also like being able to answer the phone from any room. But the signal does not reach as far as my bedroom upstairs which is perhaps more to do with its concrete walls than distance since I can use the phone about 25feet away in the garden.
1,No range.,"I own the base and have 5 additional handsets. Love the concept, but all I have to do is walk 3 rooms over(40ft) and I will start to lose the signal. My proir setup was a Uniden 2.4ghz system that literally had triple the range. The phone is ideal if you have voice over IP telephone service(cable modem)because you don't need to install additional phone jacks with this type of phone system. However, seeing the phone cuts out approximately 40ft away from the base, I cannot recommend this phone. I mean why buy a phone if it cuts out when you walk with it to answer the doorbell? You've been warned...."
4,Uniden Handset,"Great phone, but it should come with better instrctions. It is a bother to figure it out on your own, though it can be done. Can't anyone write clear manuals anymore?"
2,Storyline does not measure up to the sumptuous visuals,"First off, John Bolton's artwork in this book is ultimately what carries this book from being the weakest contribution in the Sandman series to merely ho-hum. Bolton's paint-work along with oil enhanced photographs give the graphics incredible depth and quite literally makes the visuals drip right off the pages.That being said, the superb artwork is dragged down by a weakly plotted storyline of vengeance (ancient Greek style) that meanders from confusing and sophmoric throughout. This purchase can only be recommended for those serious Sandman junkies who need to own every title in the series or for those who wish to savor Bolton's amazing artwork."
3,huh?,"Maybe it's because I haven't read the Sandman graphic novels in a couple of years... maybe it's because I need to bone up on my Greek mythology.... oh, heck, maybe it's just because I'm a simpleton -- whatever the reason, I just couldn't wrap my head around this book. I desparately wanted to like it. But try as I might, I had a very difficult time following the story (never a good sign), even after two readings.In true John Bolton form, the artwork is more gorgeous than gorgeous. Unfortunately, while aesthetically pleasing, the choice of models is somewhat distracting. Call me kooky, but I have a really hard time suspending disbelief enough to accept the notion that millenia-old Greek dieties come in the shape of teenagers.This was my first exposure to Mike Carey's work. I've heard lots of wonderful things about him, so I won't be put off simply because THE FURIES didn't work for me. If you're looking to try some Carey, maybe the LUCIFER trade paperbacks would be a better place to start."
3,Gorgeous but Unsatisfying,"The photorealistic artwork in this book is really stunning (though I prefer the more comic-booky art style of Jill Thompson in ""Sandman: Brief Lives"").The plot, though, was just ... blah. I didn't feel like Lyta Hall's story was really even resolved. The business with Cronus was never really explained (I guess I can pull out my old copy of ""Bullfinch's Mythology"" and look him up). Overall, it wasn't very satisfying.Another reviewer called this the best Sandman spinoff since ""Death: The Time of Your Life."" I don't agree. I think the best Sandman spinoff (other than the two Death books, which were awesome) was Lucifer.I don't know why this one was realeased in hardcover, other than so DC could charge more for it. I'd suggest waiting for paperback, or borrowing someone else's copy. The story's not worth the price tag."
5,"Clear and to the Point, Profound insight","This book has been a blessing to me ever since I got it in the mail. Bernard Bangley's modernizing of the profound and often prophetic insights of Bernard of Clairvaux is impeccable. The material is conveyed in a concise, clear manner but also allows us to peek into Bernard's spirituality and how he is feeling at the time the sermon is delivered. It is not a dry modernization, rather it is a clarification. This book is a must read for anyone seeking the Lord and to know Him in His beauty."
3,Just an average cup of coffee.,Barely a step up from canned supermarket brands. It's not bad but just not worth the cost. For [$...].(current sale price) one can do much better.
3,This model does not have a Cable Card Slot,"Don't confuse this model with the LC-37D5U which does come with a Cable Card Slot. I have come across other sites which have listed the incorrect model number as well in their description. This is model LC-37GB5U which does not come with a Cable Card Slot.Other difference I was told is that this also does not have the Over the Air TV Guide Features. With so many different 37"" Sharp Models available and coming out, it's no wonder potential buyers can get confused or mislead. It's probably best to get the detailed product descriptions from the manufacturer's websites instead since sometimes reviewers don't realize they are reviewing the wrong model.(...)There is a price difference between both models so make sure you are entering the right model number"
1,Do not subject yourself.,"Chili Mac is one of my favorite dishes in the world; I've had many different varieties. Hamburger Helper typically makes for a pretty tasty quick fix, so I was relatively excites to see this. However I was completely let down. COMPLETELY LET DOWN. I can see why people are having a hard time finding it, I hope HH is doing a recall.This has no real heat to it. The spice isn't a chili pepper flavor that comes to mind when looking at the box. The cooks must have experimented a taste test with burnt tongues because there is a disgusting, TANGY flavor that overpowers the dish like too much cologne dabbed on one who can't smell. You still want to taste the pasta, the hamburger, and other ingredients. Adding some tomato and parmesan didn't help dilute the taste of that awful ""chili"" flavor.I had to toss out a two packs I made for the whole family and a whole pound of ground beef, because we all felt nauseous. Yuck!"
3,A little too much going on in the romance department,"Two relationships happening at once bogged this book down, especially in the parts where the two male leads were at each other's throats. The secondary romantic plot felt very un-needed. The furzels were also a little over the top with the cutsie-ness. Otherwise, it was a very likable book.Overall, not a bad read."
4,Don't exspect it to be like Xanth series,"If you are looking to see where Letters To Jenny ties in with the Xanth Series, don't.The two have only one thing in common and that is Jenny Elfs portrayer...Letters To Jenny is about a young persons life hanging in the balance after a cruel twist of fate and the hands of a drunk driver tried to end her precious life. I found most of the letters very insperational for her inner soul to heal, and hope to see what becomes of Jenny Elf in the Xanth series.I gave this book 4 stars for the in depth information on the progress of this young persons daily tasks for life, and the heart of a wonderful writer to reach out and pull her back to the living.It's folks like Piers Anthony and many others similar to him that help folks of all ages take a moment out of their hectic lives and dream of something more adventures."
5,WOW!!!,"Fans of Piers Anthony were blessed with the chance to know the author better in his Auto-bi-Ogre-phy, ""Bio of an Ogre"", but we truly get to know more about him when we read his letters. There's something about personal letters than can not be compared. Perhaps it is the fact that there is no editing, and the heart is a little bit more exposed. I would suggest this book to Piers' true fans. They will be anxious to read more of his books because of the experience"
3,A mistake all around.,"The story behind this book is touching. The often intimate letters provide a glimpse into the everyday life of Piers Anthony and reveal a sensitive, candid side of him that most fans never get to see.Beyond that, it all falls down. It's important to remember that this is not a novel; It is a series of letters, written without any intent (on the part of the author) of publishing them. There is no plot, no action -- nothing to hold the reader's attention.If you're still curious, check out a copy from your local library; Don't waste the money it would cost to order it."
1,How far has Piers Anthony sunk,"You know, its nice when I guy takes his time to write to a little girl in need. But really, did Piers Anthony have to publish his seemingly sensitive letters. Is the guy really that desperate to make a buck.Piers Anthony did something nice: he helped a fan in need. But then decided to turn something that was really special into a quick fast buck, not only making him wealthier, but also enhancing this entire sensitive guy image that bring on the adoration of his fans. And, as anyone who has ready Anthony's notes knows, this egotistical writer feeds off of adoration."
1,Doesn't he have enough already?,"I'm glad Piers Anthony wanted to make one of his fans happy by writing to her. I'm NOT glad that he decided that every single word he writes must make him a buck. This book was cheesy and obnoxious. Weren't the letters just supposed to be between him and the girl? Why do I, a fan, need to see them? This book made me question his motives - if I were Jenny, I'd be upset."
5,McLeods Daughters season 2,"My mom LOVED her dvd set, she was upset when this show went off the air & was so ecstatic to receive the dvds. She has stayed up losing sleep because she can't turn them off. Excellent transaction too, received really quick in time for Christmas. I am very happy with this transaction!! Thank you!!"
5,McLeod's Daughters,I discovered McLeod's Daughters on WE network and became absolutely HOOKED. I looked forward to taping every episode on my DVR. I was heartbroken when WE discontinued the series after the third season. I emailed WE and they said it was to be picked up by another network which has not happened. At that time WE cautioned me about purchasing the DVDs as they might not be viewable in the US. Was I ever happy when Amazon managed to get US viewable DVDs and have started to purchase the different seasons. I don't have Season 4 yet so am not sure how I will enjoy the series with all the major cast changes. I have to say this is one of the best shows ever in any country and the MUSIC is unbelievably good. The CDs are worthy purchasing by themselves.
1,BAD BUSINESS OVERMAN2000,"HAVE NEVER RECEIVED DVD SET BUT WAS CHARGED ON MY CREDIT CARD IMMEDIATELY.HAVE SENT TWO EMAILS TO SELLER AND NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE.I THINK THIS IS BAD BUSINESS AND WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.ALSO, WILL THINK TWICE ABOUT ORDERING FROM SELLERS OTHER THAN DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON.I ORDER LOTS OF PRODUCT AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED NOT EVEN TO GET A RESPONSE FROM SELLERS.WOULD WARN OTHERS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AS WELL!"
3,Overpriced and the inflator is weak,It's too weak to be used for a car. This is more like a ball or bike inflator. You can get similar one for much cheaper.
5,Cute lil' Edward!,"This keychain is adorable and i'm really quite pleased with how big it is. Bigger than i thought it would be, the only thing i can criticize is that the colors of the actual keychain are a bit dull compared to the picture, but its amazing either way! 5 stars, love it. :)"
4,A silent adventure,"Kay Hoog finds a message in a bottle floating near San Francisco. The message tells about a hidden Incan city filled with gold and gives the location for finding it. Intrigued, Kay tells his yacht club that he's going to find it. Later, Lia Sha, also a member of the club and the mysterious Spiders, steals the map and sets off for Peru, with Kay not far behind.Thus, begins the Indiana Jones-like adventure which leads from Peru to a hidden city beneath San Francisco to a deadly cave in the Falkland Islands. ""Spiders"" from German director Fritz Lang, contains the first two parts of what was to be a 4-part serial. It's not the greatest of all adventure stories and has quite a few plot holes, but it's easy to see the influence it has on many of the adventure films of today. And, the acting is not bad, either.The DVD transfers are scratchy but still very viewable. Not many extras, though."
4,Needs Chapter 3,"I'm a Fritz Lang fan and was happy when this silent series released by Kino. It's great having Chapter 1 and 2 together in one set. It's too bad Chapter 3 was never made. This series may be the original influence for Indiana Jones. Action and world adventure awaits while watching out for the international gang, ""The Spiders"". Maybe someone will remake the series with all 3 parts."
4,Travel Doc Speakers,"It is very portable and convenient. It has nice sound for its size. The only thing that I did not not like is the fact that if the zen micro is turned off and you have it in the the craddle you have to remove it from the craddle and turn it on then put it back in. Other then that it is nice, I like it."
4,Creative TravelDock Works Great,"I purchased this product and for the price it is great. It works well and though the speakers are not the best, I cannot say anything bad about it. I feel that I got exactly what I paid for. Especially since I just received my $50.00 rebate check!! What a deal."
4,Creative traveldock speakers,"I am pleased with these speakers; good sound, great volume, and the remote is a handy feature. I wouldn't mind if they were a little smaller, but beyond that, no complaints. Good product."
2,Really buggy product...,"Like all Creative products, the peformance is amazing, but this product also has too many bugs. My speakers were basically brand new, but by the second time using them, they started producing this irritating ""crackling"" sound that wouldn't go away. I'm really disappointed with the performance of my speakers and really don't recommend buying them. Maybe my purchase was defective, but they have really disappointed me."
3,Quirky design. Take a close look.,"Decent enough sound for its size (what would you expect from something this small and portable), but the lid opens and closes in a non-intuitive way. Getting the lid to prop open and hold the speakers upright requires some attention. It's a good solution if you're committed to the Zen Micro (after all, it's designed JUST FOR this product), but I would have been happy to find a product that was a bit more user-friendly in its design. Take a close look at the photos and you'll probably see what i mean."
1,Very low reliability...,"I bought this from Amazon, not thrilled with the sound quality but it was ok. Then, one day, it simply stopped working. It won't turn on. And Creative really provides no support at all, so when it stops working you might as well just throw it away. $116 wasted!"
3,"It is what it is, don't expect too much.....","I like this travel dock because I enjoy having access to my music at all times. It comes with a travel bag, it's very compact, it's lightweight and it comes with a remote. These features make this unit very convenient.Unfortunately, the sound quality is not the greatest and the volume doesn't go up as loud as I would have liked. It's a great price, I'd recommend it."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"Either I am deaf or I got a defective product. The first time(and only time) I used this so-called music player, I realized I should have purchased a ""Miracle Ear"" to go along with it. I had to literally lean into the speakers to hear if it was on. This thing is weak. Trust me when I say... Save Your Money... Don't waste $50.00 like I did. Please don't do it. Creative TravelDock Zen is really stinky.P.S. I would give this thing ZERO stars if I could."
1,"great expectation, great desappointment","I live in Brazil, ordered this item and ask a friend to pick it up for me.So 2 weeks later, I opened the box, at first the power cable was broken.Ok, just I broken cable. I inserted four batteries and the micro zen, no sound. I push the unit a little bit, I hear the sound, but the remote doesn't work.I would not recommend, unless it works."
2,Not enough volume,I bought this because I like to listen to audiobooks on my Zen. The sound is so faint that I don't like to use the traveldock. The volume is normal from the zen itself with earphones but can't be heard on the traveldock. It looks great and is convenient enough.
5,Another top notch product by Creative,"Creative has the best products. This holds up, and is a great accessorie to the zen micro and microphoto."
3,good item but paid about 3 times more than what it's worth,"yes,I purchased this for my son- he loves it but I think that we paid over $100 more than what it's worth.His Creative Labs 8gb MP3 player quit working right before Christmas so I had to take it back from where I got it from.When I took it back,I found that they didn't have anymore of the same product for the same price so I had to get him the Apple Ipod 30gb which was for about $50 more than what I paid for the Creative Labs 8gb one & then we find out that he can't use the docking speaker system from Creative Labs here with the Apple Ipod so he's letting me use the docking system on hers which isn't a Creative Labs either but at least someone is getting some use out of it! It's a great product but was truly not worth the $149-$150+taxes that I paid for it on here- it should've been somewhere around $40-$50, not bad at all but definately not a good price (:"
2,alright for a while,ok this traveldock thing was great... for a while...pros:- sound is great- goes really loud- good looking- has a remote- is you plug it into the wall it'll charge the zen micro- and many more...cons:- my remote broke about 1 use. the ffw button didnt work then none of them worked.- i have almost no use for it any more because my zen micro's head phone jack broke. that really annoyed me. so i got an ipod nano!- now the battery life is very very short. the batteries only last 2 days. so i use rechargable ones.- what's awesome about it though (this isnt a con) it came with a cord that i can plug into my nano and then plug into the back of the traveldock and it plays!so i'm not really sure what to do with it now... i want to get the iHome for my ipod. looks pretty cool and its an alarm clock as well. i guess i could give it to my friend. he still has a zen micro.... not sure...
4,Very Convenient Product & Smartly Designed,"This little gem is very compact and has a bigger sound than I was expecting. It is convenient and simple to use. My 9 year old uses it and it is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about it getting broken. The hard case has a flip over cover and it also comes with a soft carrying case. It is great on trips, especially when you don't have a computer with you to charge your Zen. If you are an audiophile, the sound will not be good enough for you, but for the average person, it will exceed expectations."
1,Burned out after only one week!,"I made sure to use gloves when installing this replacement bulb, but it only lasted one week! It's supposed to last 4000 hours."
5,"Excellent material, insights into gay/lesbian life/issues","I started reading this as a loaner from P-FLAG (Parents, Friends, and Families of Lesbians and Gays) - found myself totally caught up in it. The combination of Deb Price's columns, with her insights into the lives of gays and lesbians, and Joyce Murdoch's text about the effects of the column on their own lives, expanded my horizons and commitment dramatically. This book is really a must-read for anyone who is gay/lesbian or knows anyone who is."
5,"Black Selector 100 CD Storage Case by CD3 Storage Systems, Inc",Very happy with the CD storage system and the price from Amazon. The shipping was fast and was very reasonable. I like the way this CD storage system allows you to choose the CD you want by numbers.
5,Awesome,"Cannot say enough good things about this product. Takes up very little room considering the space my disks were taking up before. Finding a DVD is so easy now with the list tray and the way the storage part opens with the disc you selected is really something. I own 2 and am getting two more after Christmas. Another one for me and one to start my son off, he can buy more for himself. I have never been so organized, all of my DVDs in one place. Amazing. Works fine and I have no problems with it not working right. Very easy to figure out and I really like the way you can type your list out their online site, save and print to fit in the menu tray. All pros, no negatives for this item. Con on Amazon: Right after my purchase of two through Amazon Prime, they went up $9. Should have gotten them all to start with but didn't know how good they worked. Amazon's prices do fluctuate as you know. Still an excellent buy if you check other places on the internet."
5,Discgear Selector 100,"The product works perfectly. Keeps 100 dvd's organized and makes is simple to access one and replace it. Truly appears to be a quality product. Although it is hard to make long term predictions, this product appears well designed and manufactured and should last a long time."
1,Destroys Disks,"I received one of these as a gift, after using it for four months I found that disk's I accessed often had severe damage to the edges where this organizer grabs them. This organizer uses a metal clamp to grasp the disk's, while durable this clamp can easily damage very expensive software. A simple coating of rubber would have fixed this major defect!"
5,Best DVD storage,"For a device that is non-electrical, this is the way to go.Simple and effective. Plus it gives you the added protectionfor your DVD's or CD's."
5,Excellent Value,This is an excellent price for the 100. In the past I have paid more for the 80. Plus this one is much nicer than the 80's.
3,Not as pictured,The item shipped was not the item in the pictured description. The picture showed the model with the hidden drawer index. The model sent has the index in the cover.Otherwise the product is ok. I decided to keep it as the price was probably for the item shipped.
2,The album for DVD covers is missing,"This product is missing the album that lets you slip in DVD covers. I originally ordered this item from QVC and loved it. I saved so much space by consolidating my DVDs into this compact storage unit. When I decided to buy a second unit, I decided to go with Amazon because I have Amazon prime and the price was comparable to QVC. However, when the unit arrived today, I discovered that the album is not included. In my opinion, the album is important to the system because we can browse the titles easily, my 4-year old can pick his movies on his own, and the album lets me preserve the covers. I'm going to return this item and buy another one from QVC."
1,Not nice,There was a picture of one a little further down the page and a special price if the second one was bought.I was not happy with the second one that I got. The picture of the first one was showed as the same for the second but in fact was not. I bought on the idea that the second one would be the same as the first but it was not and I did not like the second one and probably will not use it or order anything again from Amazon because of this fact. The picture shown here is the one I liked but not like the second one.
4,Space saver and Disc organizer,"I bought this few months ago and was really satisfied with the shipping and quality of the product. Earlier, I had piled up my CDs / DVDs in a carton box and was finding it difficult to locate them when needed. By using the Disc selector, it is very well organized and can carry them easily with the lock button provided.I see one disadvantage in the case and therefore have rated four stars for this product. The clamp which holds the disc is a metal clamp which can damage the sides of the disc if used frequently in the long run. Hence, please be gentle when pulling out the disc which will reduce the damage. I have posted the pictures for clear notification.Overall, I was happy with the product for the quality and price. I will recommend this product to others."
2,Trouble in Eden,"This book is about greed, lust, and sex. Those three themes consume the characters's existences. It shows how those born to wealth sometimes abuse their privileged positions and lose all they own. Although these things make most other books interesting, they don't work too well in this book. First, I know that this book is not exactly literature, but as an entertainment piece the three themes above do not enlighten me about the characters until the middle of the book, and by then, I just don't care."
1,Poor Quality,"When they say remnant, they mean it. Don't waste your money on this, it's not even good enough for ANY craft project. Very disappointed."
4,turning lawn into life,"Rebeccasreads recommends APPRENTICE TO A GARDEN as a meticulously detailed record of the author's four years of transforming the lawns around her first home in Minnesota.With little dashes of humor she offers:A Garden Germinates(First Winter)First PlantsGreedGrowing DreamsBeauty Is an OpinionGardens Are Four-dimensional & much, much more.There are some neatly rendered diagrams, a full bibliography & an index of the plants she reintroduced to her landscape, although there is much need for photos of before & after."
5,A GArdern in the Rain,"Love the books by Lynn Kurland, characters are integrated to make the series seem a solid history of these Scottish clans and there spouses. Nice mix of historical and present. Am still working my way through the series."
3,Patrick wasn't cool in some scenes,"When Patrick MacLeod appeared in ""With Every Breath"" he was tough as nails and cool to boot. But that wasn't always the case here. When the book began, he allowed that idiot Bentley to push him around - verbally and physically. Why? It was never explained.Patrick's job seemed so out of place in this story. It was unnecessary to the plot. Why would he even take a job if he was wealthy? He didn't stop to consider that a working class guy could use a job like that.Patrick is very dominate over Sunshine in ""With Every Breath"" i.e. very protective and very caring, but here, when he goes to see Madelyn, he must go through Sunshine first. It was stupid what she did to him. She was very bossy and he didn't dare talk back to her. Doesn't really fit the reputation of a great Scottish warrior.Overall though, Patrick & Madelyn's story was good and ended nicely."
4,Awesome Read!!!,"Lynn Kurland is very refreshing. The sizzle is more like an underlying current than an overt display as what is typical in romance BUT it doesn't take away from the story. If anything, it seems to somehow enhance it. She creates an incredible plot with characters that feel real and relatable. I love all her books!"
3,"ok, not great",Not enough fire or passion. The hero isn't terribly believable. Story kind of drags. Not as good as I hoped.
3,Okay,"This was okay. I've read better time travel novels. But when you've got nothing else to do, this will kill time and will make the time passable."
2,Disappointed,Disappointed in photos. I am from Texas and expected so much more. There are so many options here to use and missed the mark. I returned my copy. Something that I rarely bother to do.
4,My work in a coffee table book.,Naturally I like this book because it has photos of an art house that I spent months working on. For me it is a lovely photo essay of different styles to help homeowners decide the look they are going after in building or renovating. Many thanks to Amazon for helping me locate this book.
1,PAN FISHING,"VERY POOR QUALITY TAPE,FILM FLICKERS AND JUMPS THE WHOLE TIME YOU ARE WATCHING.THEIR IS VERY LITTLE ACTUAL FISHING."
2,Disappointing,"This is a simple mesh tarp. It's not sturdy and twigs,etc. get caught in the mesh and tear it. An ordinary tarp would be far superior."
2,You'd be better off with a tarp,Good weight and strong handles however the fabric is already starting to tear after a couple of uses. Also it retains more water than I expected (perhaps wrongly) and as such becomes dirty and difficult to handle very quickly after exposure to wet leaves. Pass
4,A strong and witty debut,"An excellent debut - I'd read Andy Quan's ""How To Cook Chinese Rice"" in an anthology several years ago, and it struck me as inventive, adventurous and very tightly written. This debut collection more than lives up to the promise.Quan's writing is culturally aware and very smart, but also very playful and unafraid of quirk and humor, and throughout he creates worlds where a refreshing directness, and an occasional willingness to jab at topics most writers (or most gay men) would prefer to dance around makes each of these stories very tough, in the best of ways. The wonder of ""On The Paris Metro,"" or the what-needs-to-be-said qualities of ""What I Really Hate"" are other high points - all-in-all, a strong debut.I look forward to reading more of Quan's writing.-David Alston"
2,Great picture ....not reliable,"I purchased Sharp LC-37D7U 37"" LCD TV less than two month ago.The great thing about it is that picture is really great when you watching any HD programming. Plenty inputs and great sound.Unfortunately when it comes to reliability it's a different story.The thing that get me very disappointed that TV power supply stopped working and TV just died.... after all it is $3600 set. It's been more than a week now and Sharp can not provide any resolution whatsoever.I did read similar review on CNET about the Sharp LC-37D7U failing after a week but still decide it to purchase it, because other great reviews for Sharp LC-37D7UBottom line: it is a great TV if it is a working one"
3,One disappointment -cablecard feature,"We live in an area serviced by Cox communications. A Cox representative came to install the cablecard this afternoon. To everyone's surprise, we learned from Sharp's customer service representative that this TV does not support the recording into the VCR/DVD recorder if a cablecard is used in lieu of a cable set top box. The recorder just won't pick up any signal via various connection configurations. So we had to make a decision there on whether to use the cablecard at the cost of losing the recording capability or to keep an extra cable set top box and return the cablecard."
2,"I works, but is not very sophisticated","It does what it is supposed to, but the sound quality is significantly degraded from the factory Samasung headphones I was used to.when used with regular headphones the resulting tangle of wires is far too long to be anything but a menace, or used for playing jump rope! The switches are cheap feeling as is the rest of the components."
3,ok product,"does what it says, plays music through phone. the only bad thing is the length of the cord. it is way to long. i have recently lost this, and ordered another adapter. if you don't mind bundling up the cord then go for it."
1,Buyer Beware,"Bought this for my mom who didn't want to pay $30 for the charger at the ATT store. When she plugged in the AC charger the first time, it blew a fuse and powered down her computer. Due to this experience, she did not want to even plug in this car charger and risk a problem with her car. We learned the hard way that you get what you pay for. For this type of item, you're better off going to the Samsung website and using an online coupon from retailmenot or a similar site."
3,Does not fit all lighters,This item did not fit in the cigarette lighter in my car. It keeps sliding out. I have to adjust it until it lays just right and then not touch it all so that it does not pop back out. It did however fit in the lighter in an older model truck. The car is 2000 and the truck is 1992.
1,they sent the wrong charger,They did not send the correct charger. It will not work with my phone and I don't fell like contacting them because it's not worth the effort.
4,Just what I ordered,"It was just what I ordered and came in before the ""due date"" in the mail. I have no trouble with this product."
2,Same ole story,"I bought this old dvd version in 2004. If you have this dvd I would rather save money for it. From 2004-present chapter, Viviendi mixed the contents with the Giants team highlights from these yrs and America's game.Overall I would have liked the dvd more had they changed their contents a bit."
4,thrilled to hear the wilson sisters' vintage sounds again,"I must be Ann and Nancy's biggest fan, I'm sure and the release of Whirlygig seemed like forever. This album reminds me of Heart back in the 70's with Dreamboat Annie/Magazine/Little Queen. Sand is my favorite cut, I play it on the piano everyday. Two black lambs and Elysian are also two favorites. I love these guys and they have seldom let me down. Keep doing, girls! We need you."
4,An excellent entry into the Wilson canon of music.,"When I first listened, I wasn't sure I enjoyed the CD. After listening again, I found myself enjoying most of the album. Miracle Girl, Kiss, and Sand are three standouts. Although I miss the magic of the 70's Heart, this album is an excellent continuation of Ann and Nancy's legacy. Their lyrics and harmonies are especially well done on this album. A nice addition to any Ann and Nancy collection."
4,"Different name, same faces","""The Lovemongers"" is an alias for Ann and Nancy Wilson and selected friends ... aka ""Heart."" The music differs from recent Heart efforts, however, in that it's clearly a return to their roots and simplier times. Less ""rawk"" (as the Wilson's might put it) and more personal. Fans of the late 70's era Heart will definitely enjoy this disc."
3,Great CD but lose the male vocals,"If I could remove the Vegas Gene and Heavy Sedation I'd give it a 5 stars. Great to hear new music from the Wilson sisters as I've been a fan going way back to the beginning, but I don't buy their music to hear some guy doing vocals."
4,Can't beat Heart,"With so many members coming and going in Heart, this was merely another incarnation of the band to me. But I'm guessing Sue Ennis had more than incidental input. But the Wilsons continue to be much more than oldies artists and this was a pleasant way to revisit them."
2,Not as good as it could be.,This isn't Heart. And they don't try to be. Ann and Nancy Wilson have discovered that freedom from a major label can lead a group into mediocre and boring music. A weak first full length recording from Heart's Ann Wilson and her sister Nancy (ex-Heart guitarist) and friends.
2,Ann and Nancy are capable of doing better.,"OK, so, I am in the record/cd store, and I happen upon a cut-out cd, no longer available, from ""The Lovemongers""?/aka ""Heart"". This cd is the Lovemongers: battle of evermore (Led Zeppelin), a cover song, belted out by Ann and Nancy, at their best. Another cover song, Papa was a Rollin' Stone, is another great example of the harmonies , from the Lovemongers, although no longer in print, this continues to be one of my favorites, now, if we could only get WNEW FM, 102.7 NYC, to release the interview/acoustic session with Nancy Wilson, I could die happy :)"
4,Best book in print on the health policy process,"I have used this book for a number of years now in a class I teach on the Politics of Health Policy (along with Kingdon's classic). It provides an excellent overview of how health policy is made and the politics around it, drawing on both the academic literature as well as recent policies. The second edition is heavily revised from the first and contains up to date examples. An excellent academic overview of the health policy process."
5,Easy Read that Explains How Policy is Made,I am taking a course in Health Policy and the Political System and opted to use this book instead of that recommended by my professor. This book examined all the important aspects of policy making - paying close attention to the political actors - and has helped tremendously in my understanding of the politics surrounding health policy.
4,Excellent for a quick read,This book was a required text for one of my classes. I recommend it to everyone who is looking for a quick but comprehensive reading on health policy in this country.
5,Delivered as promised and in great condition,"It came a bit slower than expected (say 2 weeks, when I was expecting to get it in one), but overall I was very pleased with the transaction."
4,Well written with understandable examples,"Very well thought out. A delight to read given the subject matter. Some of his SQL tricks will inspire even the most advanced DBA to try new things. Covers the subject very well, from theory to practical application on several of the top database packages."
5,The Hobo Philosopher,"I have several books giving brief biographies of the presidents of the United states. I imagine that there are quite a few people like me who are interested in reading about U.S. Presidents.This book is well worth the price. He gives a lot of accurate information in a few pages. All the info. is categorized and it is the same categories for each president - so comparisons can be made easily. The author, does of course have his favorites and some are looked at more favorably than some others. I would say that Clinton is rather heavily negative while Nixon is taken rather in stride but the facts are still the facts and they are there for each man no matter what the slant.This is a very good volume for reference purposes.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A.."""
4,Solid Biographical Reference,"Author William DeGregorio has done a nice job portraying the lives, loves, decisions, and biographies of each U.S. President. Readers learn more than just some basic biographical information. We also learn about what motivated them, their personal views and philosophies, their friends, loves, foes, romances, failures, successes etc. In short, we learn what made them tick. The book is readable, concise, and contains headings for the various categories. One weakness is that there is much less information on some of the more ancient chief executives, but this remains a valuable and easily-read reference."
4,A must for anyone interested in the Presidents.,"This book is a must for anyone interested in the Presidents. It is filled with an endless amount of information and formatted in such a way to find the information you need, such as The election results, The president's parents and children as well as birth and death dates. I was amazed that this book even gives the time of day the President was born and Died.This book was published in 2001 but fails to give the date of death of President Nixon as well as the Death date of Jackie Kennedy. It also shows President Taft's daughter Helen Herron Taft as still living and she died in 1987.This book was updated to include President George W. Bush, but failed to update information on the former Presidents. Overall I would give this book Four stars for it's reference material."
3,Ok light Reading,I have read the entire Twilight series and its ok....I think that Bella is immature and selfish. Edward has all the characteristics of an abusive controlling husband....Having said all that.....In three books so far Stephenie Meyer has yet to describe what Bella looks like????? That is so weird..How many books is she going to write before she describe the main character?????
4,Good Brain Candy...,"Ok so after however many years I finally got around to reading this.Why you ask? My neighbors daughter (she's 16) gave the set to me as a gift, and she gushed over-flowing how excellent the book was and that the movie was coming soon and I just HAD to read it. So I did. I liked it.I wasn't crazy about some of the expressive language (nobody really ""said"" anything, they ""hissed"" it) But as an adult who reads alot I can say I enjoyed it. The main character Bella has caught some flack for being a bit boring, and while I agree she is a bit flat, I think Stephaine Meyer made her that way so she could be more easily identifiable as ""every girl"".The secondary characters are drawn quite well for an YA book, and I can definately see the appeal for the younger gen.Lots of angsty love, longing and romantic tension.The relationship with her parents is believable, and her interaction with her friends at school only reinforced why I hated HS. It really is just a hotbed of nastiness isn't it?"
2,"Ummmm,","Maybe I'll try again, but I could BARELY get past the first page.""My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down""?Wow. I was not aware airports had windows that a person could roll down, up, sideways or in any other direction. But perhaps I just expect too much?How can anyone take seriously an author (no less a published one) who makes such a basic mistake in sentence structure? I would expect better from a high school graduate.Continuing, the writing and word choice is so......hysterical? Honestly, I could not stop laughing.The whole human girl falls in love with vampire has been done: Buffy/Angel, Dracula/Mina"
3,entertaining for teens,"I read this book becasue I coach a high school team and this book has been all the rage with high school age girls. I can see why. This book has all the drama, angst, and ecstasies of high school relationships and attempts at romance. There are the beautiful vampires and the very average protagonist ""Bella"", the latter captures the attention of the beautiful Edward. The deficiency of the story is the failure to explain why Edward would have such a compelling attraction to Bella. The writing style uses the end of chapter cliff hanger device to keep the book moving at a fairly good clip. There are also some imaginative scenes concerning vampire lifestyles. I would recommend this book for high school girls, but cannot recommend it as an adult read."
1,Please deliver all readers everywhere from vampires and zombies!,"I'm so tired of all the attention that vampire and zombie literature is garnering. ALL of, including Meyers' series is ""literary dung""; destined for the ash heap in a few years. Truly unmemorable, poorly written, stereotypical shallow characters. The only thing imaginative about it is the dollar signs that the author imagined when she cranked out this truly egregious crap. To me, it would be the sort of thing that appeals to 12 year old girls, right along with the ""My Little Pony"" movies and Justin Bieber."
2,I don't get it....,"I had no intentions of reading Twilight but I have several close friends who could not stop raving about the book and insisted I read it. After giving in, I do not understand what all the hype is about. I consider myself to be pretty open minded to fantasy fiction but this was just way too strange for me (vampire baseball....really???!!) Weird weird weird...not to mention the story was extremely slow moving and the stupidest details were repeated over and over again. The only reason I am rating this with 2 stars as opposed to 1 is because I actually read the book to the very end....although this was probably only because I kept thinking that it HAD to get better at some point in order to live up to its reputation. It never did."
2,Nothing new.....,"I have to admit, I've always been a fan of vampire literature (and television.) I'm confused, however, about the immense popularity of this series. The writing in and of itself just isn't very good- and the characters seem exceptionally two dimensional (and I don't want to be verbally abused here) but very unintelligent.And I have to admit- I was kind of shocked to see just how similar much of the storyline and ideas were to the writings of L.J.Smith-another young adult writer- whose work is MUCH more enjoyable to read.I would suggest buying this book- while it's not well written or anything new, it is somewhat enjoyable. I would, however, also seriously suggest taking a look back to older (though less popular) writings like L.J.Smith's Secret Circle/Vampire Diaries series. You'll love her work if this is your kind of thing- trust me."
5,so amazing,"ok. so i bought this book on impulse at Borders, like i do with most books. i thought it would be like any other. was i ever wrong. the first thing i did when i finished the book, was read it again. i didn't want it to end, yet i wanted to read the end so bad. :o) the characters were so vivid, both Bella and Edward, and everything about the romance between them makes me smile just thinking about it. i Recommend this book to anybody who likes to read!!"
2,Garbage,"I bought this book after reading various reports of Stephanie Meyers' horrible writing ability. I had previously read The Host and found it enjoyable, so I was skeptical about the bad reviews I had encountered. It turns out they were all true. I couldn't even finish this one. Bella is an awful main character. The writing is clumsy at best. The story leaves much to be desired."
1,Terrible Writing,"I don't want to waste anymore of my life on this book so my review will be brief. I do not understand the popularity of this book. It is poorly written. The characters and relationships portrayed are shallow, unhealthy, and annoying. The dialogue is insipid and embarrassing. I'm genuinely surprised that I suffered through to the end of it. There are SO many books that are more worthy."
4,Captivating writing style . . . sick view of love.,"While this book is written in an interesting writing style that keeps one hooked all the way through. It seems to pass off a very controlling, obsessive, and stalker type fellow as a caring love interest. Vampire or not, the way Edward watches Bella while she sleeps and often hurts her when he holds her arm seems to be an unhealthy obsession with the girl rather than true love. And Bella seems attracted to this alpha-male character which in real life would set her up for an abused wife situation. So, yes, the book is entertaining. But I hesitate at the style of passive aggressive infatuation that it promotes as love."
1,A two word review.,"1. Utter2. GarbageI tried, I really tried to like this book. My 15yo daughter loves the whole series to the point where she's read them three times, and in the interests of sharing her joy, I started reading Twilight. But I couldn't finish it, it was so boring I'd read a page or two and fall asleep.Bella comes across as a brainless, immature twit and her knight in shining alabaster, Edward, is drawn as a brooding, controlling, not very interesting or chatty social leper. Pity he wasn't drawn and quartered.I'm totally at a loss to understand how this series got to the top of the best seller lists and stayed there for so long....and is still there, when there are so many more excellent novels much more deserving of a place."
1,Yuck,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It is really boring and I didn't like it at all. Edward is creepy and Bella is dumb. My friends don't like it either. It is the dumbest, stupidest, most useless book I have ever read!!!!THE END. :)"
4,"Good, Clean Fun","I've never been a huge fan of romance, especially young adult romance, so I was skeptical when one of my friends strongly recommended this book. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Meyer reels you in with her prologue, which does not actually take place until the climax of the story. The first chapter would have been very slow without the prologue, but instead it becomes easy to plow forward. It is this curiosity that propelled me through until the climax of the story. As I said, not a fan of romance, and although some of the dialog did come off a little cheesy to me and a few characters were just a little bit flat, overall it was very enjoyable."
4,good not great. not for kids,"I really enjoyed these books however I agree that Bella is a horrible female role model but i also think it depends on who's reading the book. I honestly don't think this book and the series should be for young adults. I mean its a good series but i would never want a middle schooler reading it. A few days ago a friend of mine said she saw all 4 books in a middle school library, which i think is insane. I think the book would be better for people who have a better grip on reality and on top of the horribly antifeminist influence its also pretty racy(and gets more racy as the books progress). All I'm saying is i think the book should be read by people maybe 16 and up who realize how unrealistic it is."
5,Couldn't turn the pages fast enough,"My 15 year old daughter read it, I, (38) read it, my mom read it, she's 60. We all absolutely love this book and then immediatly went and bought and read the sequel to it called ""New Moon"". I read a lot and I don't remember the last time I felt so much for the characters in a book. You will be smitten!"
5,An instant classic!,"I had no interest in reading the books, as fantasy is not my usual genre of choice. Several of my friends were reading the books and insisted I give them a try. After the second chapter, I was HOOKED! I'm now on the fourth book, and I'm slowly feeling grief creeping over me, because the series will soon end. I hope Stephanie Meyer continues on to write of these amazing characters! Everyone should give them a try!"
3,stephenie meyer,Teenagers should love this novel. Right amount of romance and vampire lore. Should stimulate interest in the upcoming movie.
4,Twilight Review,It was nice light reading and easy read. Good character development. Definately geared to teens but adults will enjoy it too.
2,Addictive,"When I realize that I have a stack of Meyer's Twilight saga in my bookcase, I cringe a little on the inside. The writing is mediocre--barely past what I or my other high school classmates can write--and the characters one dimensional, but the plot is so addictive that it makes you want to read more. Too bad quality literature can't enrapture teenage girls the same way."
4,Twilight,"The plot of this book is mostley about Bella Swan, and Edward Cullen. Bella is a regular girl that just started high school she turned 18, and she's in love with a vampire. At first I was thinking that the book was going to be kind of boring at first but when I started reading more I thought that I should keep on reading. So bella is clumsy, and Edward is wise, nice, and worryful of Bella.I think that a person that just want to kick back and relax after a hard day should read this book.I rate this book a 4 out of 5 ."
5,Stayed up until 3:00 in the morning finishing it,"Wow! this book was amazing. I must admit, Stephenie Meyer is a talented writer!17 year old bella swan moves to Forks, a small town and meets Edward Cullen, who has a dark secret. Aside from him being a vampire, she finds herself falling in love with him, but is this really the safest path to take? Or is this relationship worth risking all, including Bella's beloved family and her own life? I am currently reading new moon, the sequel to twilight that just came out recently, and it's just as suspenseful! I'll probably be done with it tonight, if this keeps up :) no doubt about it."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"Maybe it's because I'm not really into the teen section books, but this was really one of the worst books I've read. I got about half way through, and I could go no further. Maybe it's the writing style that didn't do it for me, or the whole cliche thing about falling in love with a vampire. Whatever it was, I've no idea why this book is so popular. From what I've seen, the only people who seem to enjoy this series are teenage girls who never read anything else, but heard from their friends how ""great"" the books are, and got into them because they don't have anything to compare them to. I'll take Anne Rice and Lestat any day."
2,Kind of cute...mostly boring and redundant,"So I don't know why people LOVE this book. My opinion is that its...just okay. So its kind of sweet the way Edward treats Bella. A friend of mine described the book as making her feel ""like she did the first time she fell in love"". My feelings weren't quite as strong. I thought the book was kind of boring and I thought some of the book's storyline was laughable...I mean glittery vampires? I also thought Bella was an incredibly boring character."
1,Not even gonna read it.......,I'm not even gonna read this this book its stupid!!! Its all about romance and vampires and blah blah blah!!! Everyone knows that the best series in the world is Harry Potter!!! J.K Rowling is da best!!!!! No one can beat her...no one!!!
1,Non review,"I did not receive the book. The post office damaged it and returned it to the sender. I hope to get it at a later time, am will be happy to review it at that time. Thanks.............Anna Rogelstad"
4,"Cheesy fiction, but I still enjoyed it!","Yes, this book has lots of technical issues, and could have used some more editing; but the concept behind it was cute IMO. Ultimately, this book was about a love story; for those people who are hopeless romantics, this book can be enjoyable. Keep in mind this book is FICTION and therefore not meant to teach our youth anything; so I am not sure why readers criticize actions and decisions made by Bella and Edward because it is all FICTION. There is no moral to this book. It is simply about young and innocent love.**sigh** :)The series is enjoyable, for light fun reading, cheesy romance and fantasy. Would I call it the best series ever, NOT, but it is easy to read and gets your imagination going; especially if you have watched the movie (Edward is cute). If you are looking for a complex and well written book, then this might not be for you. If you are looking for something light and you have nothing better to do, you might find yourself reading all 4 books!"
3,The Way He Loved Her,"Stephenie Meyer did a good job capturing her audience and finding the right people to target the book's market. I can see how the younger crowd flocked to this book -- the idea of love is fresh and new for them now. Bella's character was exasperating, her clumsiness is unreal. And how is it sexy to kiss a cold dead body? I did love the way Edward felt a call to protect her -- most women want that, or I do, at least. People who like this book would really like Renee Mincey's ""Love of Pure Evil"", even though Ms. Mincey's book may be for a more mature crowd."
3,Poorly written enjoyable story,"I read this, as well as all the other Twlight books, before I allowed my tween daughter to join Bella on her journey. Although it was tediously slow and poorly written, I did find the story held my attention most of the time. I found large sections of the book to be repeditive. Perhaps Mrs. Meyer worried, unnecessarily, that the average young adult reader would need constant plot reminders.This was a quick read that I will remember for quite some time. Oh, and...I did let my daughter read it, and she LOVED it!"
2,Is this the best we have to offer young people?,"I had to check this book out given all the recent hype. I'm all for a great vampire story - but this one has absolutely no depth whatsoever. Unless you are a semi-literate teenager there is no way you could find this story interesting. The writing is so elementary it's impossible to get interested in the characters. I know what a hit this has become but I'm really scratching my head over this one. The writing style should never be a distraction to the story. But, I kept finding myself noticing how the words were put together instead of the story. The dialogue is painful. What a disappointment. I hope there are other good books out there for younger readers . . ."
1,ITEM I NEVER RECEIVED,"I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM. ACCORDING TO THE TRACKING LOG. USPS SENT MY ITEM AUGUST 4, 2008 BUT NO ONE WAS HOME. THEY CLAIMED THEY HAD LEFT A PICK UP SLIP. THE PICK UP SLIP I NEVER SAW/RECEIVED. UNTIL NOW, I DO NOT KNOW WHERE MY PACKAGE IS. IS IT STILL IN THE POST OFFICE...IF IT IS, HOW CAN I PICK IT UP? I HAVE NO PICK UP SLIP. WAS THE PACKAGE SHIPPED BACK TO AMAZON? I DONT KNOW!!!!! I CONTACTED AMAZON THROUGH E-MAIL FEW TIMES AND NO ONE SEEM TO RESPOND AND ITS ALREADY AUGUST 31, 2008. I NEED MY BOOK OR PLEASE REFUND MY MONEY. NO ONE EVEN CARE JUST BECAUSE I ALREADY PAID FOR IT. P.S. I HAVE TO RATE THIS ITEM 1 STAR SO THE SYSTEM WILL TAKE MY REVIEW EVEN IF I DID NOT RECEIVE MY ITEM.THIS IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE."
1,Junk food for your brain,"Addictive and yet completely unsatisfying once I finished the book. The premise is derivative--vampire falls in love with a mortal whose blood he wants to drink. Bella is an annoying narrator. Meyers have pet words she uses repeatedly throughout the book: glittering, Adonis, to name two."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"This book is engaging enough, but the writing isn't particularly good. Ms. Meyer needs to get over her fear of the word ""said;"" her endless, awkward ""encouraged me""s and the like became quite distracting. The phrase ""'Shh,' he shushed me"" made me laugh out loud at what was supposed to be a tender moment.I would recommend Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments trilogy over this book any day. It has some of the same elements and would appeal to the same audience but is a lot more creative and, unlike several recent runaway hits, is actually well-written."
1,Keeping Up with your Teen,"Your kids are going to somehow read these books because they are the cool thing right now. You can't stop them, but you definitely can read them along with your child. I read all 4 books to help my 12 year old wade through the mature themes covered in these books--divorce, self esteem issues, stalking, gang rape, abortion, murder, just to name a few. I think it's important for girls to understand that they cannot build their world around another person. Also, that it is OK to want things (money, beauty, popularity, sexual relationships, etc.), but if you want those things too much, it always leads to trouble. Be a parent - talk to your kids. These books are interesting, and they do open up communication."
2,Great for the young reader,I finally broke down and read this book after three different people told me they were positive I would like it. I didn't. My biggest complaint - the writing style is too juvenile. I can see pre-teens and teens loving this book but I simply could not get past the writing style. There are too many well written books out there to waste your time on this one.
2,Ick.,"I'll give Twilight this: it keeps you reading. But in a way that you want to just know how it ends and never touch it again. The way she describes the vampire Edward is just TOO MUCH! And Bella doesn't have a personality of her own, she's just too dependent on Edward. Plus Ms. Meyer, the author, did not give Bella any flaws. This book is DUMB."
3,Good but not the best ever,"This isn't as bad as I'd heard, but it also isn't as good. It's really a decent book, well written, but not amazing. I've now read all of them and this first one is definitely, in my mind, the best."
5,Love,Love this book!! And it's for all ages not just the teens & tweens as I originally thought. My husband even got into the movies!
5,Love it,"Love it, enjoying reading this awsome book, can't put it down. Can't wait to read the rest of the twilight books."
3,Newsweek Article Misleading,"I bought this book after reading the article in Newsweek. I think the comparisons to Rowling are a bit premature. First of all there is really no character development, you can never understand why these 2 love one another besides she thinks he's beautiful and he likes the smell of her, they have no substance. I get the fact that this is the first book in a series so these things should be revealed in time, but i've read the other books are trust me, they're not. It is really just teen angst ridden melodrama and i absolutely cannot believe that Newsweek would present is as anything other.I think the premise of the book is very promising as is the premise for the new book, but i can't help but think about the books they could have been in the hands of a more seasoned writer."
1,Should not be so famous,"OverratedNot a good role model for young readersI can't believe this has gotten so big, I just do not get it."
1,Just crap,I saw lots of people reading this book on the commuter train so I thought I'd give it a try. It was so crappy I didn't want to waste my time finishing it. Lots of others have already explained in detail why it's rubbish so I won't go over it all again. My advice is just steer clear of it.
3,Love the Book ... But,"I read the books, saw the film and waiting for the DVD which I already ordered. So I give it a try for the audiobook. I do this because I never try audiobook before, I am a bookworm. Nothing can keep me happy like the way I could hold my favourite book and read.As I mentioned that I gave it a try. Much to the love of the story of forbidden love between Bella and Edward, the audiobook cannot make me exciting in anyway. Not because Ilyana Kadushin's voice (her voice is really good and strong), I think because of my perception to her voice that make I felt dull and unromantic. I know now that reading the book and listen to the character voice that I had create in my mind was satisfy myself better than listen to other person voice."
5,Absolutely phenomenal!,"This book is absolutely amazing, it has changed and helped me through so many ways. It helped me overcome my depression and taught me to believe that true love does exist. I recommend this novel with two thumbs way up!"
5,CAPTIVATING for both girls and guys,"one of the best books I have ever read and that is saying alot seeing how I read like 5 books weekly, I read this in less than 24 hours you never want to put it down and i let it to my brother and HE LOVED IT TOO!!! GIRL AND GUY BOOK!!"
2,Bafflement,"I have to admit I'm totally baffled at the popularity of these books. I won't be buying any beyond the first, for sure! I don't think this book would have held my interest past possibly Jr. high .... I've found it, well, boring - not very imaginative - requiring absolutely no thought or reflection on the part of myself as the reader. The only reason I went with 2 stars was that some young girls may be interested. I'm sure glad I didn't buy all 4 which would have been my normal M.O."
4,A good read,"Twilight is is a good read if you're looking for a little romance, a little angst, and a little supernatural flavor. If you're looking for a decent-sized novel to chew on, I'd recommend this."
2,If you are not embarrassed.,"You know you read books that are like television. If books were cities, this book would be a mall in a city. Or a city that has a tourist industry based on its proliferation of outlet stores. This book was worse than DaVinci Code (Angels and Demons was better, television still). Go visit a real city, unless you are a teenager and then you aren't ready for a real city. Wait, it wouldn't hurt to visit one anyway - so I'll take that back. Go buy a real book."
3,A One-Time Read,"I loved this book the first time, but it fell apart when I reread it.The first time you read, everything seems fine and you're excited to read it. The second time you read it though, everything seems cheesy. It seems like Charlie is too gullible, Edward and Bella fall in love too fast, and Bella is too perfect.I would recommend this for a one-time read, though, but only as something to pick up at the library."
3,Uninteresting.,"I found this book to be poorly written and quite flat. It wasn't untill I was into the book 130 pages that my interest peaked a little. I wanted to enjoy the book because I love the subject matter, however I was very disappointed. I felt that the writers primary emotional descriptions for each of the characters, were that of being angry and hostile, and she left everything else by the wayside....felt somewhat repetitive."
5,"Amazingly well written, even for the 'older than YA' crowd","I am far older than the target audience for this book. I am an avid reader, and usually use the local library to keep up with my habit. I not only purchased this book, but the whole series. The author's writing style creates the sense of emotion required to pull the characters off the page and make you feel like they are a part of your memory, instead of your reading material. The story is one I will read with my kids when they are of dating age so that we can discuss the moral character that the characters exhibit, while being head over heels in love. The book is engaging,and the characters form good realisic picturesof teen life while carefully maintaining moral ground. I can't wait to read the 4th! I would have never picked up a vampire book on my own, now I can't put it down! I was so pleased to find a great book that I can't wait to have my kids read."
2,I would have loved this book when I was 17,"I can see how a teen-age girl would think it was great. It was written for a younger crowd. However, don't bother with it unless you're a teen or are a fan of Harlequin romance - or unless you like stories where the two main characters spend all of their time scowling, glaring, bickering or being ""dazzled"". In fact, you may want to read this before you let your impressionable young girls read it. Edward is too controlling and jealous for a healthy relationship. That said, about half way through the book became at least entertaining enough to finish."
2,too mushy,"ugh...couldn't even get through half of it. if you want a book where the girl fawns and obsesses over someone, this is the book for you. i can see why it's for teenage girls."
5,good book,"Def liked the book.. made the mistake of watching the movie first.. there were a lot of details left out of the movie (i.e. cullen family history, how everyone came to be) the timing is a little messed up in movie too as is how the events take place.. but i'm not reviewing the movie.. i read this book in one day.. yes.. i did.. and it was great.. if your a girl.. you will love this book.. you will want to be bella and you will fantasize about Edward and blush everytime she talks about how he makes her feel.. that for me is a well written well described book.. i'm starting the second story (New Moon) I hope its as good as the first! if you like this fantasy stuff.. this book is for you"
5,Obsessed!,This is the most wonderful love story I have read in years. Once you begin reading you will immediately fall in love with the characters (especially Edward) and not put the book down until it is finished in its entirety.
2,It's a LOOOOOOOOVE story...,"Yeah um-not really feeling the ""whole vampire thing""-the book seemed to be about a teenage love story-it was a hit at my job and I am 30+ was the only reason i read it(can't explain that)Edward being a vampire had nothing to do with anything, and they really didn't seem to be that in looooove, and the way the vampire charaters are described, couldn't somebody be able to tell in that small town that something was wrong with them FOLKS!!!"
1,Ummmm...what's the big deal about this series?,"I was prompted to read/start this series as a result of all the praise I heard about it. I tried to read. I mean, REALLY tried to read this book. Got a third of the way through and said FORGET IT. I have no idea why this series is popular, particularly when you hear rumors such as the Twilight series being ""The Next Harry Potter"". The level of writing is juvenile - I actually remember reading lines such as ""She's just jealous."" I'm not expecting Shakespeare or anything, but COME ON. I suppose if you're a 13-year-old who reads at an early-junior-high level and enjoy the trite writings about teen angst with vampires, you'd CONSIDER trying the book out. Better yet, don't buy this book. Borrow it from someone before presuming you're going to delve right into this mediocre book/series."
4,Loved it!,"Alright. I was given this book. I was skeptical. I did not expect to like it.Well, to my slight embarrassment - I LOVED it!Sure, it's teens in love - but this a VAMPIRE and a teen in love!At times I felt silly at how much I enjoyed the syrupy sweet sentiments and over-the-top emotions. But not everything you read has to be WAR & PEACE.No, this book won't change your life but it will give you something fun to read (and now that it's paperback) for a very reasonable price.And yes, I have already ordered the 2nd book in the series.Live a little and add some Twilight to your life."
5,My favorite series of Books!,Love this book. I read a lot and this series is now my favorite series!
3,Avid Reader,"I'm currently in the middle of reading Twilight having recieved this book and the second in the series as a Christmas gift. I don't read young adult fiction as I am 45+ but decided to give this a try as I have always found vampire-focused stories interesting. Who doesn't know about Dracula? I've been reading through a lot of the reviews which are a mix of both negative and positive. Granted this is not a Pulitzer Prize winner in scope or in quality, and critics should keep the target demographic in mind, but the story does manage to hold your attention...good entertainment value -- which is the purpose of fiction writing in general. If you're looking for writing that will make you think or that has some social relevance try A Thousand Splendid Suns, for example."
5,The best book of the Twilight Saga,"I'm writing this review after reading all the books in this series as I could not stop reading to write.Although I must admit the first book is the best, I still enjoyed the whole saga.Bella, a teenage girl at 17, who moves to a new school falls in love with a very handsome guy at first sight, Edward, who turns out to be more troubled than an average teenager. Edward and his family are nice vampires living among people. Nice or not falling in love with a wolf turns out to be a little risky for a lamb. The story hence folds into series of troubles trying to keep these two from each other.Very nice romance."
3,Akin to Pride and Prejudice,"I enjoyed this quick read. I wish we could have gotten into Edward's head a little more. After reading all three of the Bella and Edward saga, my frustration level rises with the lack of knowledge of Bella's gifts."
5,My fave book of all time!,"At first, I didn't want to read this book because I thought it would be scary. But it is a romance and not scary at all. I was able to meet the author and she signed my book! I am now trying to get my friends in book club to read it! I also enjoyed New Moon and can't wait until the 3rd book comes out!"
5,A Different World....,"... for me that is. This book was a recommendation from a co-worker. I have to say that I loved the book. Yes it lacked in the story line at little but over all I loved it. And yes I loved that Bella ended up with Edward. It was a typical ending, you expect it but I love it.Just read it and see for yourself and see."
5,Addictive!!,"I am so addicted to this book. I'm not a teenager, like it says you should be to read it. I'm 30 years old and love this. There are a lot of typos, but the story plot outweighs that. Be warned though. Make sure you have nothing to do because you won't get anything done but reading."
2,Poorly written,"This book was really disappointing. Not very good at all. It is definitely for teens or younger, so don't bother if you're over 16. The teen angst drove me insane and the writing was not up to par."
1,Suck on this,"By far the most naive, poorly written, over rated, garbage I've ever read. Words cannot begin to describe how sad it is that so many people find the romance between Bella and Edward to be ""dreamy,"" when in truth Edward is nothing more then a stalker. If your some one who thinks some one breaking into your house to watch you sleep sleep is anything but creepy, you're deaths will serve to decrees the surplus population."
5,Super romantic!,It was the best book I had never readed ! It was so romantic and with action drama terror and passion THANKS STEFANIE for the best book I had readed!
2,A Slow Start to a Good Series,"There's a little more high school and a little less history and philosophy in this book than I'd prefer, but it is an engaging story. Bella, an ordinary, regular teenage girl from Arizona, moves to rainy Forks, Oregon, and there meets Edward, a Dominant, brooding extremely good-looking vampire. Bella comes to love him with her whole heart and soul, and Edward confesses to her that he's afraid he finds her so delectable that he may not be able to control himself around her. Any allegories to sex are completely intentional, so you can see why so many women love this series of books.The vampires in Edward's ""family"" of choice are almost *too* good and pure, and the family love-fest scenes started to make me sleepy. Luckily some villains show up and the end is more exciting.""Twilight"" could have been a formulaic romance, and it's not, for which I am thankful. It's worth reading, if for no other reason than to get to the next book, ""New Moon."""
1,This is the Gigli of books,"Worst book I've had the displeasure of reading. Went in rather open minded, came out able to insult twilight as much as I want. They give no negative to being a vampire.Being a vampire is the single best thing ever with no repercussions."
3,Unimpressed,"It was an okay read. The story wasn't as interesting as hoped and the beginning was hard to get into, but Meyer does know how to write an excellent suspense story. I wish she had played up the mystery of each of the Cullens' backstories, as that was my favorite part. in addition, I found myself prefering her secondary characters over the main characters and I had a hard time pinpointing age on the heroine. I think that if this book was condensed and about 200 pages shorter, it would have benefited.Not a bad story, but unremarkable. I recommend Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' vampire novels."
2,Meyer is no Rowling,"I read this series to keep up with the pre-teen and teen girls in my neighborhood. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. These read like they were written by a 12-year-old. Meyer is no J.K. Rowling, that's for sure. You can blast through one of these puppies in a couple of hours. Meyers seems to make up unnecessary characters when she runs short on creativity (i.e. if 5 vampires are good, then 30 will be better). This is especially true in the last book. And book #3 was pretty useless."
5,Love these books,"These books are addicting. When I started reading them, I didn't want to put them down. It's like watching a good movie, you don't want to stop in the middle of it. I highly recommend them. They are mainly, I think, geered more towards teens, but I enjoyed reading them, and so did my friends that have read them. (from ages 13 - 46) Stephainie Meyer is an awsome author, they're really well written. The story keeps your interest sparked."
1,Audio book,"I wanted to share my thoughts as to the quality of the audio production of Twilight. The books were amazing, but I found the audio book severely lacking. There was very little emotion put into the reading of this story. I would not recommend anyone buy this. You can find more in your own imagination. I enjoy audio books and I do hope that it will be redone in a manor that will capture the characters."
5,AWESOME SERIES!,"I did read all the Twilight series, and would like to read more work about the Twilight series. I would love for there to be a sequel to all four of the series."
3,Teen novel with vampires,"Compared to most books on vampires - this book is definetly in a class all it's own. I enjoyed the book overall, it is definetly a teenage novel with many similarities to Romeo and Juliet."
3,Whiny but still engaging,"A friend recommended that I read Twilight, so I figured I would give it a try even though I'm in my 30's. I think that I would have loved this book as a teenager, but I found it hard to get past the (literally)hundreds of pages of the main characters whining. Basically, Edward is a vampire who says over and over and over again (in my words), ""Don't love me. I'm dangerous."" Sheesh. Where have we heard this before? Then Bella, the love interest states (again, my words), ""Oh but how can I not love you?"" I'm not a romantic. It just made me want to throw up a little bit.However, once I got through all of the silliness, I actually did think that it was a pretty good, easy read. It is escapism... but I really thing that the editors should have worked a bit harder!"
4,"Easy read, I found I couldn't put it down!",Ok so I have heard all the hype on this book so I bought the first one. I opened the book and read. this book is so easy to read and you get caught up in what is going on. You keep waiting for some big action but it never seems to happen. inspite of that the book was good. Good enough that my husband had to pick it up and read it. I have bought all the rest of the books and yes we have read all of them. We have looked forward to each book. The books are worth reading an you will be amazed at how fast the time will fly. Perfect to get a young person intrested in reading.
1,Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles is a real vampire series.,"This Twilight series makes me want to puke when I know that the de facto vampire series has already been written by Anne Rice. Are you Twilight fans aware of The Vampire Chronicles? Twilight is akin to Fabio novels for teenie boppers. If you are at all interested in reading the best vampire series that has and more than likely will ever be written, stop wasting your time w/this fluff and check out The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice."
4,Mom - Avid Reader,"This was a very interesting book. Definitely tailored toward the female audience. Girls can definitely relate to Bella's low self-esteem and her need to belong. She is definitely every girl. Not a book for most guys unless they can overlook the fact that it goes against their ideals of how a vampire should be. My husband is very much one of those guys who believes you should not deviate from the norm. I, however, applaud Stephanie for her imagination and courage to go against the norm on this."
1,Bordering on the verge of a cheesy romance novel.,"I read the book Twilight, after my cousins repeatedly raved to me how great it was, and I was more inclined to read it after hearing that it would be adapted to the big screen later this year. I thought, it must be good, right? First, to put it bluntly, the storyline passed dreadfully slow. There were so many chapters with really nothing pertaining to the plot that could have been easily edited out. And, the protagonist's thoughts about her godlike crush were mentioned too many times. I'm sorry, but I was wrong thinking this would be good, just since it was being turned into a movie. I mean, remember Eragon?"
1,Rip-off,"After reading it, it's clear the plot of this book is a rip-off of LJ Smith's The Vampire Diaries, an older, and much better written series.Seems originality in literature is dead these days"
2,"Quote the Bible, only to Fall for the Devil?","Meyer has listed this as the Twilight Saga. Yet, as a stickler for words (and based on the character of Bella), I can't help but have the impression that this book is more romance and chick lit than a long story of heroic achievement. A heroine is someone who saves the day; save us from chaos, as opposed to collaborating with it for her own selfish, boy-crush needs.The other definition of a saga is: a long, involved story, account, or series of incidents. This secondary definition applies. The tension is palpable in Twilight. Bella and Edward, though tediously, go back and forth (as teenagers do) in their ""saga"" for forbidden love. Not much action but if you love romantic drama, get this book. For a more popular, comprehensive review, read gaimangirl's most helpful feedback."
1,This is the worst book ever put into stores (or the internet),"Seriously? Am I the only one who actually hates these books with a flaming passion?They're not even that good. This is what these books are teaching young girls out there:1. It's okay to either have a stalker for a boyfriend or be a stalker.2. Teen pregnancy3. It's okay to have an abusive boyfriend.Vampires do not sparkle. End of story.Look I've tried to give these books a chance. But I couldn't even get past the first five pages without hating it. I've grown up with better pieces of literature such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Secret Garden, which is more proper to read than Toilight."
4,very nice read,I really enjoyed this book and will contine to read the rest in the series. I have to admit I am 31! Sure it is light reading but there is just something I loved about the characters and story.If you are skeptical I say give it a try!
3,Romance with Vampires...,"Stephanie Meyer does such a fabulous job writing Bella Swan's infatuation with Edward Cullen that you don't notice there isn't a story until you're almost finished with the book. Meyer puts a little teaser of a story at the end so you THINK that the next book will be plot filled but you will be highly disappointed.If you are a die-hard romantic you will LOVE this book (and you may even want to check out some Korean soaps/movies). However, if you are looking for the next Anne Rice or JK Rowling, you may have to read through the first two books to get to anything close to a story line that would interest you. I am both, so although I refuse to buy the third book, I am going to barrow a friend's copy and read it but I'm not in any hurry."
3,I just couldn't sink my teeth into it,"I was initially hopeful, but ultimately disappointed in this book. I can't put my finger on what was missing, but I just couldn't sink my teeth into it. And I really wanted to like it, honest. Someone told me I wasn't the target audience, but I can't imagine what the target audience would be? Vapid 14 year olds?"
5,Can you put TEN stars on this thing????,"Stephenie Meyer truly captured the feelings of true love. Edward and Bella are perfect! I love Edward! He is brilliant, and smart, and hot. The book shows feelings about life, and love.This book deserves more than ten stars, A MUST READ."
4,Love the details,"Better than the movie.Details left out are well documented here.Background of the characters not provided within the movie is enough to understand who, why, when and how."
1,Sappy,"Literary garbage, end of story. Read for yourself if you so desire, don't just take my word for it. But if you truly appreciate any form of thought-provoking writing, stray away. Now."
5,Excellent,"I love this series. I started reading book 1 on vacation, ended up getting the rest of the books and was done in mere days. I do not want to put any spoilers, if you are like me you like surprises and wouldn't want to spoil them. Avid readers who might even remotely be interested I would recommend reading the samples and if you like the writing style, just get it, I doubt you will regret it."
4,Not a fan.,"I am not a fan of the Twilight movies. I am not necessarily a fan of the books, either. But if you want, if you need, if you have to have a dirty pleasure, then go for it. This book will make you feel like a teenager. It will make you feel young. And it will provide you with more than enough fodder for the fire around your water-cooler, coffee-maker, or book club."
3,"Good series, could have been better.","I liked the twilight series, though it could have been better. I saw the movie first, and everyone kept telling me how much better the book was. I guess my expectations were too high, as I found it pretty much the same as the movie. I would still recommend though."
2,boooooorinnngggggg,"It's one of the rare cases when the movie is far better than the book, and the movie was far from a masterpiece, though entertaining."
5,Twilight,"I LOVE THIS BOOK. Well, actually, I love the entire series. I have read Twilight 4 times. It was such a great read, that it only took me a day and a half to read the entire book. (if that) I couldn't put it down. I purchased the other three books maybe 2 weeks later. It took me a week to read the other 3. I loved them all. You really can't get one, and not get the others. I almost didn't get New Moon because of some bad reviewes. I'm glad I chose to see for myself. It's all about personal preference. So.... If you're a romantic at heart, and you have an open mind.... then you'll love them ALL. If you're a skeptic, and need complete and utter realism... you may have problems. It just depends. I love Love.... and everything that it entails... the Good... and the Bad. So, this was the perfect series for me."
5,Twilight,I love this book & the entire series. It is a captivating series. You won't want to put the book down. It is an enjoyable and easy read. I would definitely recommend it!
3,Twilight,"Very light reading. I would not have purchased the series had I realized it is aimed at the teenage reader. It's not unpleasant, it' just formula and everything is expected and predictable. Now I'm stuck with the 3 books and would not have purchased one had I realized the level they are written for, and especially since they're romance stories, a genre I don't enjoy."
1,Very Disappointed; but not with Twilight,"I was expecting to receive a new book with the original Twilight cover as shown. What I got was a used book with the Twilight movie cover. I purchased this book believing that I would get the item in the picture. I did not. I am very disappointed in the sellers choice of advertisement. I would think that new means unused and that the product would look like the picture in the advertisement. In the future, this seller should be honest in advertising. For example, like-new is not new and show the actual item that you are selling. I will not purchase from this seller again."
5,Great,THis book is amazing and I just couldn't put it down. The plot and setting of the boooks id just amazing you feel like you are there and feeling what the characters were feeling
3,Overrated Story,"I will never understand the whole Twilight phenomenon. From an objective point of view, the first book was completely average. It did introduce us to most of the main characters who be in the rest of the books and a little character development was done on Edward, his family and Bella. Most of the book is about Bella trying to figure out what Edward is, accepting it without a problem, and trying to start their relationship.My main complaint is that the plot didn't seem to jump into gear until the end of the book. When I finished this book was a excited to read the next because I felt like Meyer finally hit her stride....unfortunately I was wrong. New Moon was horrible! So at least I can say was Twilight was much better than book two in the series."
2,"Great love story, bad writing.","I loved the ensuing love story, but that's about as far as it goes. It's Meyer's first novel and it shows in her writing. It needs a lot more description of the characters and surroundings. Edward Cullen does not have any faults and this gives him an unfair advantage against his opponent because you're always wondering how he can every lose when he can freely read people's minds without any side-effects. Two stars, but only because I LOVED the love-story and I think Meyer's can write some good romance."
2,Overhyped,"Read the whole 544 page novel, and liked about 50 pages worth of scenes. I thought the vampire baseball idea was excellent, but Bella bored me. Meyer had a few inspired metaphors, like the glittery vampire, and 'Twilight' -- the 'perfect romance' because all good days must end. On the other hand, the book contained so much fluff and tedium that wading through the high school emoting just to hit the highlights was a draining experience. Also found Edward on the 'stalker' side.I would not recommend this novel, unless you enjoy high school romance novels."
4,Surprisingly good...,"Again, I guess I'm really late to the Twilight party, but I had to see what all the fuss was about. Again, I give it the star rating then start to think about it and wonder if I've been to generous... What did I like? The werewolf story line - for me - worked very well. The dark secret of the tribe at La Push, the gang, the growing up of Jacob Black, the sinister description of his the other possible 'gang members.'But the other stuff: Edward's absence sends Bella into a loop of emotion that I found it really hard to empathise with. She's freezing cold all the time, she curls herself up into a ball, all the time, and this goes on and on and on and on and on.I think thats my principle problem withthe story. Too long.And yet again, the constant references to Edward, Rosalie, and the rest all being impossibly beautiful, astonishing, etc etc. Why aren't they ever a bit geeky or whatever?"
2,"Fan of Buffy, Not Bella!!!!!!","Bella is annoying, selfish and not a good role model for girls. I'm not sure why she is so helpless and needy, but she is... and unnecessarily so! I like the NA theme and read 3 of the 4 books as a screening process for my kids, but I will have to discuss what a strong and healthy lead character should look like and why the sudden infatuation with a boy without much thought is common among teenagers, but in the long run it is not healthy.I wish Stephenie Meyer would have wrote a strong lead female character, but I'm not sure if it's the strong patriarchy stressed in the LDS religion that influenced her character development of a helpless needy girl that needs the strength of men to protect her or what. But it isn't the best book I've ever read, but I enjoy the NA theme and the discussions about selfishness, independence, and healthy relationships that I can have with my kids."
1,"When you put together a bad plot and terrible writing, you get Twilight.","Twilight is by far the most overrated story ever concocted. The story in itself is horrendous. At my school, we have a little skit that sums up almost the entire series. It goes like this:Bella: Edward I love you!Edward: No Im too dangerous!Bella: Edward I love you!Edward: No Im too dangerous!...THIS IS NOT A GOOD STORY. Also the book portrays Edward as perfect in some parts, but COME ON HE IS A VAMPIRE HE HAS PROBLEMS. So yeah now I shall rant on the writing.The writing of this book is absolutely terrible, its uneven sloppy and at times capricious. I could barely stomach parts of the first book, and Id occaisionally read parts of the third book over a friends shoulder. All I saw while doing this were a bunch of small, cheesy words, and one long one that completely shatters what flow the book had.Therefore, the reason this book is popular is a complete and utter mystery to me. I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT."
1,how did this book get published?,Goodness...this book deserves less than one star. How in the world did it get published? Why is it so popular? Vampires don't sparkle! And that interview says she hasn't even read Bram Stoker's Dracula!
4,Generally Intrigued,"I was looking for a new saga to get into, and to credit Meyer, this book did just that. You've got yourself a nibble Ms. Meyer"
3,Twilight,"My wife loved the books and movies. I was able to withstand one move, but the books proved to be too sappy for my taste."
2,Not happy with this product,I was not happy with a few of the cd tracks that was not able tobe heard. I had to miss a part of the story. Other than that the storywas great.
3,Not bad. Fun read.,"After hearing a friend talk about this book, I downloaded it to my Kindle and quickly finished the entire ""Saga.""For tweener lit, not bad. If you thought that Charlaine Harris' ""Southern Vampire"" series was a bit too risque for your 14-year old daughter, this would be an OK solution. However, I was a little disturbed by how much of the Twilight Saga borrowed from Ms. Harris' work. ""vegetarian"" vampires. The shapeshifter full of unrequited love for the heroine. The gorgeous perfect vampire lover. The telepathic main character who can't penetrate the thoughts of their lover. It would have been nice if the vampires had a few weaknesses or if there were some moral parallels to be drawn with modern society.Glitter vampires?Despite the fact that much of the dialogue reads like an extended text message ""OMG, EC is SFH! WTF! Vamps wnt to eat me!"" I finished the whole saga and had a good read."
5,Re-discovered books with this series,"I just recently finished the Twilight series books for the second time. I would consider myself well read but having small children around for the last 6 years, I haven't been able to read a book without pictures for a while now. These books brought the passion for books and story telling back to life for me. The characters become real and are consistent in their behaviors. You can almost predict how they will react - hence the importance to the story telling which Stephenie Meyers does very well. I am not a vampire fan - but I do like finding a little oasis in my day and these books provided it for me. Her other book The Host was also a great read and I am grateful I had something else to read to distract me from Twilight. If not I might have picked up the books again. Now I am on the hunt for a new book to read until Breaking Dawn is released. Thank you Stephenie for rekindling my passion for reading again."
1,Boring.,"Boring, boring, boring. The author guts the vampire myth of everything that makes it compelling."
5,they walk among us,"phenomenal read. although categorized for young adults and teenagers, this is definately a good read for anyone one. perhaps a pg 13 for some content (suggestive).from the 1st page you drawn in, one of those page turners you have a difficult time putting down. be prepared when you get to the end of the book, you will want to run out and get the next in the serier.exquisite character development, and the imagery is amazing! definately the next incredible fantasy to grace the book shelf."
2,Not good,I have to say that I'm rarely annoyed by stories. This was one annoying book. I hate when characters fall in love too quickly for no reason. I hate both main characters. Bella is annoying. Edward is creepy. The end.
5,A Delicious Read for Lovers of the Movie,"If you loved the movie Twilight, you will love the book all the more. On a long weekend away at the beach I finally got to this book. How fun to be able to read additional scenes (not in the movie), get into the minds of Bella and Edward, and enjoy a teasingly drawn out romance. The first touch, not even first kiss, doesn't happen until about 200 pages in. There also are pages and pages of wonderful Q&A in this book on the inner workings of living as a vampire and as a teenaged girl. Stephenie Meyers does a nice job of creating likeable characters and good story telling without the writing getting in the way. She brings the reader back in time to being 17 as well as re-defining vampires and making them living among us seem plausible, somehow. Absolutely delicious."
2,Not Worth It,"Although, the first book is full of good epicure and the occasional metaphor, all the hype about this book is not worth it. You will feel your eyes glaze over for the detailed oh-pity-me scenes, and although there are endless descriptions of Edward, it is a decent novel. Although I thoroughly enjoy the first book, the second is not worth a minute of your time. The ultimate snoozer,as dull as dull can get."
3,A Granddaughter's Influence,"OK, I suppose I would never have picked up ""Twilight"" without seeing my 13-year-old granddaughter reading it. Carolyn is very bright, loves to read, and I respect her opinions. So I was curious to see what she was enjoying (she had soon devoured the whole series). I found the book to be quite good -- suspenseful and well written. Stephenie Meyer has a good grasp on the elations and insecurities teenage girls must learn to deal with, and the vampire fantasy is as good a one as any to explore. Young people love fantasies -- Carolyn had long since experienced dinosaur and dragon stages and had raced through the Harry Potter books. And how well I remember cherishing Tolkien's Lord of the Rings tales as a lad. I've heard some denounce ""Twilight"" as trashy and soap-operish, but I simply found it an entertaining romance. I don't really have intentions of finishing the saga, but my curiosity is satisfied and my faith in Carolyn's taste is affirmed."
2,Good for one read,I'm re-reading this for its comic value. Just got to the part where Bella talks about how stupid she is. I'm not going to argue with her.
1,Glisten - really?,"I am a blade fan. I strongly feel that vampires should explode in sunlight. I also feel that by taking away that weakness, you elevate vampires to a demi-god status.This is a romance set in a vampire backdrop. I didn't care for the romance style. Please don't hate me, Twilight fans. This is just an honest opinion."
5,A Must Read!,"Although this series is written for young adults, the writing and storyline kept my complete attention (and I'm a not such a young adult). The portrayal of vampires is so creative and unconventional but most enjoyable. This is an innocent, romantic love story that captures the struggle of a teenage girl coming of age while mixing herself up with vampires and werewolves. What a great story!"
1,I didn't care for it one bit,"As so many others I was eager to read this book, due to the big hype around it and its sequels. However this is just rubbish, and when I have a daughter I will not encourage her to read it. The heroine is so accident prone that she should live in a mental institution where all the cushioning will keep her safe. Then there is Edward, the vampire she loves. Though he sounds very dreamy he is just plain dumb. If I were a vampire I wouldn't reveal my secret after a month with the looney chick after keeping the secret for nearly a hundred years. All the laughing and questions are annoying, along with the remaining family of vampires accepting her with open arms, as if she were one of them instead of an appetizer as she should be. People out there, please don't give this book a minute of your time."
5,Twilight,It was a fun and exciting book that is full of adventures and cliffhangers which I like.I love it!!!!!
2,You must have better things to do with your time,"I had a suspicion, almost from the first page that I was reading rubbish but as you can see I have been kind and granted this novel 2 stars as the writing in places is just passable.I bought the book on the strength of the blurb on the back (when will I learn) - ""An Amazon Best Book of the Decade... so Far"". Shame on you Amazon. Anyway, I actually have just arrived at page 110 and don't intend to go further; I have better things to do with my time.Why this decision; well I checked out those ""suspicions"" on Amazon and when the one star reviews are written better than the five star reviews, then that's the time to give up.However, I can understand that this novel might have some appeal for less demanding readers, after all it's not as ghastly as Tuesday with Morrie, which was also a best seller and also reflects on the public's appalling lack of literary taste."
1,I don't get it.,"It reminds me of any other teen love story i have ever read. Nothing different except vampires which does not save the story. I can understand why people love this but its just not for me. Oh and i don't like how they treated the mythology of vampires it was all wrong. Please don't kill me for this review, just my opinion."
3,okay...,"I do have to say that this is a amazing novel. But if you had the slightest inkling of like for this book you will be blown away with what drama is coming in the rest of the twilight saga. read.read.read. this one in particular was not my favorite for obvious reasons. First it was boring in most parts but others were awesome and that annoyed me so. anyway, all i have to say is get this one over with so you can get to the drama. it will make you want to sink your teeth into the rest of the books. this is only the beginning."
5,Twilight,Okay apparently i lived under a rock when twilight the book first came out because i didnt know what all the fus was about when the fist movie came around. I was looking in the paper and had seen a article about some teens sleeping outside the theater waiting for the movie. So i asked a coworker what all the mumbo jumbo was with Twilight she laghed and told me it was a gread saga and all about how amazing the world of the cullens was. At first it all seemed kinda kidish to me i wasnt really wanting to be a big nerdy twilight fan lol but having always enjoyed a good fantasy i asked to borrow the book. I couldnt put it down and didnt stop reading untill i had finishd breaking dawn. They are great books anyone who hasnt taken the time to read this its so worth it im glad i did.
4,Recommends,Book arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. The book provided a good introduction to the characters. I was left intrigued and immediately started the next book in the series.
4,Great book for stimulating the imaginations of young adult readers everywhere!,"Growing up, I was always an avid reader, but as I got older, I stopped reading for fun because of all the school reading I had to do. When I was 10, my imagination was stimulated with the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. It wasn't until I was about 15 when my imagination was stimulated once more with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series. Then college came, and I started reading nonfiction books only. It wasn't until Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series came out that my imagination was stimulated once more. I admit, the writing wasn't superb, but the storyline and plot was enough to suck me into a young adult fantasy world I only wished I could be part of it. I love the chemistry between Edward and Bella and it reminds me of my own high school romance."
4,Enjoyed reading this but won't go on to next chapter of the soap opera ...,"Enjoyable for a good part of the book, then quite readable to the end. But I seen no reason to continue reading the series as this is another one of those books which are written with, apparently, the sole aim of seeing how many sequels can be squeezed out. The soap opera-ish mode is well in place 3/4's the way through the book. It's a shame because I think this author writes well."
3,Good but not incredible,"I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed reading this series, but I do find it incredibly overrated. There are many books out there that are far better than these and deserve as much acclaim as this one has. I have many friends who are obsessed with this series. I enjoyed it, but I'm definitly not obsessed nor do I find myself wanting to reread them. In short I would recommend this book but there are far better series out there to become obsessed over."
3,clever use of the vampire tale,"although this title is obviously geared towards the teen female reader i thoroughly enjoyed the read and have since continued reading the series. i am a 36 year old married man with a 5 year old daughter. i would encourage her to read the series when she is of appropriate age. i rarely am captured by a female writer. (anne rice, another female vampire author, is probably my last female writer of interest.)"
4,Kid at heart,"I thought that this would be just another teenage girls fantasy romance, but it has much more to it then that. If you are looking for love in all the worng places ""Twlight"" is for you. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes vampires and to those who are helpless romantics.]"
2,Twilight,"I think this book deserves five stars for the adventure, and romance that teenagers love all combined in this wonderful novel that, being a teenager,I can't seem to get enough of"
3,"Pretty good story, pretty bad writing.","After reading all 4 books, I really enjoyed the story, start to finish. Character development was good and I felt like I knew them all, which was a plus. But the poor writing style actually made it a chore to get through all 4 books. I found myself skipping paragraphs because they were exactly the same as the paragraph before, just reworded. The word 'chagrin' should NEVER be used as much as she uses it. I feel that if a different author had written the story, it would have been much more enjoyable. Funny enough, I'll be posting this paragraph as a review for all the books in the series...and I won't be rewording it..."
4,Good read if you're looking to not think about your life,"I really liked this book, especially because the story ""sucks"" you in and you don't think about your dumb life and stress anymore and enjoy reading something light and interesting that takes you away from it all. It is not deep and totally mysterious and some of the things in it are silly, but that is not a bad thing. Its a light and fun read even though the book's huge. But in between my job and commute I finished it really fast feeling glad that I picked it up. I also felt silly at first because I was reading something targeted towards a much younger audience but like I said, sometimes you need to get away from it all and this book totally helps you do that."
5,Twilight,"this book is very good. i bought Twilight from amazon,and i read it and i could'nt put it down.i think that i read this book in about a few hours or days.im not sure. i looked at another website that sale's books. someone wrote a review,and said that this book was good only if you where.a 12 year old girl. i am not 12 and i loved it. if you love anything with vampire's i think that you should give this a try. i can't wait to read thee other three books. also to see the movie when it comes out,Happy reading. Bella+Edward Forever:)"
1,Appalling,"Absolutely dreadful - no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Poorly written story that glorifies an unhealthy, codependent relationship between a whiny, emo teenager and a controlling, emotionally abusive stalker vampire - that sparkles. Blech."
1,Bad Influence,"I find it really hard to even give this series one star. I sincerly hope parents of young teenage girls read this and talk with thier daughters about how far from reality Bella's relationships are. This caracter is probably the stupidest girl i have read about in a long time. We all get upset after a break-up but lets get real. This girl has made ever one around her misserable and she could care less. Giving ultimatums to her fater, using Jackob, dumping her friends and the list goes on with many stupid things. I just want to reach in to this book and strangle the little twit. Dont get me started on Edward, com on ""you cant go see Jackob, he is dangereous"". How many times has he told Bella I might kill you? What makes him better for her then, at least Jackob has real feeling for her. Needless to say I disscourage any young women from reading thies series, it should have came out in the adult section for this girls stupidy alone."
5,Amazing,"I loved this book so much, it's amazing. It took me about 2 days to read it and I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the characters and Edward reminds me of my boyfriend. It's really hard for me that there are only two books so far, I'm like craving the story. It's so sweet and written incredibly. I can't express how much I recommend this story. It is by far the best book I have ever read."
2,Its a book for Teens and it shows.,"I'm a 46 year old woman who was advised to read the 4 Vampire books by Stephanie Meyers, by my sister and two work friends. I am now on the second book and I must say that they are by no means anywhere near as good as Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. However, I take into consideration that these books are written for a much younger demographic (although, so was Harry Potter and I enjoyed those books immensly!). Nevertheless, I'm determined to finish reading all four books. I read for pleasure, so who cares if the books are juvenile romatic cheese-balls -- it's strictly escapist reading anyway. (P. S. If you enjoy morbid humor, try reading Christopher Moore's ""YOU SUCK"" and ""BLOOD SUCKING FIENDS"" -- both are also about vampires and absolutely hilarious!)."
5,Excellent book,"I am a high school teacher who noticed many of the students were reading this book so I decided to give it it a shot. I am a huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan so I was intrigued. It wasn't easy getting the book from the school library b/c it was always checked out but I finally I had some luck. I didn't touch it for 2 weeks but when I finally sat down to read it, I fell in love with all the characters. I finshed the book in 2 days and finished the 2 sequels 2 days later. I havn't been this excited about a book since Harry Potter. I highly reccommend the books and I can't wait for book 4."
1,annoyed,"these books are aweful and should all be shot into outer space. if you think you are a vampire, you crazy."
3,Good story but way to much description on Edward,She is a great writer but way to much time is spent on describing how beautiful Edward is over and over and over and over again.
4,Just a fun...enjoyable book that leaves you unable to put it down!,"For all the negative reviewers out there leaving ""biting"" (pun intended) remarks regarding the grammatical or spelling errors, or character deficiencies, I say...LIGHTEN UP. It's a BOOK...a fictional book, for the purpose of entertainment. And I, along with countless others who helped propel these books to the top of the best sellers list, found this one quite entertaining.You just cannot help but be sucked in. I read all four books in 1 week and am salivating at the promise of Midnight Sun.If you haven't read them, I say forget the naysayers and Go For It!"
5,The best book to buy,"I really really, love this book! It is the best one out of new moon and eclipse. If you havent read it yet i really think you should buy it, its not expensive at all! if you didn't like this book you -- have a seriously strange taste. I would recommend this to girls aged about 12 to 19 or even older."
1,Death is Better than Twilight,"This has to be one of the trashiest books I have ever read.If you are over the age of 10 and you read and like this book I will personally hunt you down and forcefeed you the book.The book has zero character development, repetative use of language, gaping plot holes and page upon page of ""Edward is hot"". Stephanie Meyer systematically ruins every single vampire story. Bram Stoker is turning in his grave. GLITTERING SENSUAL VAMPIRES?! IS SHE SERIOUS? Edward, ""the ideal boyfriend"", is in reality an abusive stalker.Now if that kind of book sounds up your alley, go ahead, read it and fall in love with Edward but I and the sane half of the English speaking world will hate you for all eternity.Please face the fact that Edward is not real and will not stalk you and abuse you, making all of your sick fantasies come ture."
4,Very entertaining series. Borrowed them from my daughter...,"I was looking for something light to read when my daughter dropped these books on my lap and said, ""Mom, just trust me, you'll love them.""So I grabbed Twilight with a groan and sat down to read it in front of my fireplace. After reading for 6 hours. I snapped the book shut and grabbed the second one.I WAS HOOKED...I admit it!I'm 36 and reading about teenagers, but the writing pulls you in and makes you care about the characters. Just because the characters are teenagers doesn't mean they aren't well rounded and interesting. Stephanie Meyer has managed to make them smart, adventurous and full of life. This is in contrast to other books I've read that leave the young characters appearing stupid rather that flawed. I ended up reading the series twice in 2 weeks.A great gift for any young teen...and maybe their mother... :)Can't wait for the next installment to the series.Stephanie, keep the books coming!"
4,Sweet vampire romance,"Alright - I'm a bit bias. I'll read anything that's about vampires. But this book was not only well written = the characters were relatable. I won't even say ""for a young adult novel"" It's not fair. It was a good book that I'm looking forward to a sequel - or 2 - hopefully.The vampire myth is a bit tilted - which is nice, actually. Adds a bit of mystery. It's a sweet slightly dark romance that is perfect for the season."
1,"This book is garbage! Unbelievably poorly written. Consider yourself ""dumb"" if you liked this book",I would believe it if someone told me this book was written by a 10-year old. The content of the book is extremely predictable and immature. It's nothing but a trashy romance novel. It's very sad that so many people thought this book was worth even a minute.
1,The most gawdawful thing I've ever read,"Read this to see what all the hype was about. Wow, I'm worried for society! The book had no redeeming value,. It was a drippy romance about crushing teens. The vampire stuff made no sense. The characters were unbelievable and annoying. It was total drivel."
1,melodrama is alive. or at least undead.,"Bad writing, shallow characters, contrived plot, clunky dialogue. This book is for people for whom V.C. Andrews is too intellectual."
5,Great Book!,"This is probably the best book i have ever read! My friend read it and absoloutly loved it, she even read it 4 times and suggested it to me. I thought it sounded like a stupid story because I am not into the whole vampire thing but as soon as I started it I couldn't put it down. The book seems long with nearing 500 pages but it was so good I read the whole thing straight through."
4,twilight,"Great book, keeps you wonting more. I love the charqactors in the story. I highly recomend it. Can't wait for the next book."
1,the worst piece of fiction I have ever read,"I asked for the series for Christmas, based on all the attention these books have received. I have now taken them back for a full refund after enduring 130 pages of Twilight. I cannot believe this drivel was published by a respectable publishing house. I cannot imagne anyone older than eleven wasting their time turning the pages....NO STARS....."
4,Twenty-nine y.o. woman still finds Twilight a good read,"I was reluctant at first since most bookstores advertise the Twilight Saga series as teenage fiction, but I truly love a good vampire story and thought I'd give it a try. I used to like Anne Rice books, but she started getting a little too sexual for me, so this was a good book to start back with, since its audience was intended to be younger.I have to say I fell in love with all of the characters, especially Alice, whom I wish that I could be best friends with in an alternate reality. The descriptions of the characters made me feel like I could see them, and I am anxious now to read the rest of the series.I am giving the book to my best friend so we can talk about it."
3,Not Half Bad,I like these books books. A lot of people dont but they weren't half bad. I liked the conflict and it was full of suspense of course when edward if blabbing about how much he loves Bella you can't help but roll your eyes. And it gets waaaay to sappy at some parts.
1,A young romance novel,"Do *not* buy this book if you are looking for fantasy. If you love romance novels or vampire novels, and you are young, you will probably like it.It is 498 pages of moody teenage girl swooning over dangerous teenage boy and dangerous teenage boy dazzling her and saving her from one peril or another.I was very disappointed because it had such high Amazon ratings -- I couldn't even read the whole book. But then, I am not young, and I'm not into romance novels. :)"
1,Sorry,"So first of all I dont care if people will eternally hate me for this but i dont care. I thought that this book was good to some extent but it would have been better if it was written in a higher reading level. I dont mean having more innappropriate scenes but maybe describing somethings with a more adult view. Also the continuous desscription of how attractive and charming Edward is gets repetitive. It also seems that the boys in that town where rather desperate to get a girlfriend or Bella is perfect which is doubtful considering she can't last a day withoout causing trouble. It doesn't seem logical that four guys wanted to go with her. I do like the environment though, the rain the clouds, the lack of sun, the green, it just seems nice."
1,5 star reviews of this book are painful to read,"I am always so sad to see yet another person write about how ""amazing"" this book is. How disappointing that Stephanie Meyer is making so much money off a book that is hardly worthy of it's preteen/middle aged women audience. I have many friends and family who love this book, so I am not insulting the readers, but rather the culture that has led us to believe this is anything close to decent writing. I'm all for reading ""fluff"". Just not poorly-written fluff with one-dimensional characters who are horrible role models and project unrealistic ideals about love."
2,I just don't get it...,"I was given this book by a co-worker. She practically gushed and glowed as she told me about this ""fantastic"" book. She said that since I like vampires, I would love this one. Boy, was she wrong! From chapter one, I had to force myself to read it... only because I knew she'd want to discuss it and I hated to rain on her parade.The novel was rife with mistakes and seemed to drone on and on and on and on... you get the point. Bella is a whiny, primadona who only thinks of herself and seems to be depressed by things that would make most girls happy. Really? Really! Maybe I could have gotten into the novel a bit more if it wasn't for my extreme dislike of the main character. By the end of the book, I was actually rooting for James to kill her whiny ass! After I gave the book back and politely said no thank you to the rest of the series, she asks me to watch the movies... Oh the horror! But that's another story...~ Jo"
3,I just couldnt get into it,"I wanted to - I really did. But it just didnt happen. The dialogue and plot was just so very very slow that I couldnt gain interest. I struggled until the very end, determined to finish. All in all, I'd have to say that I'll pass on reading the sequel. That being said, Meyer is a talented writer and I would definitely be interested in reading other works (non-Twilight) from her."
3,Eh...,"I read this book a week ago after being pushed by friends.. I enjoyed it.. I guess.. But by the end I was ready to slap a few.. well most of the characters.. It was to slow for me.. Bella and Edward actually frustrated me with their ""romance"" I'm not a romance fan.. nor am I a vampire book fan.. Wait that's a lie.. I like Laurell K. Hamilton's books well enough.. I suppose if I was back in middle school again I'd enjoy it as little more.. Maybe..If you're into romance and annoying main characters than this is the book for you :)"
3,Not bad,"O.K. I'll admit that I didn't have very high expectations as I'm certainly not into vampires and werewolves, etc. But, really well done story and quite fun to read. I'll pick up the next I think now."
3,Tween heaven,"All of my friends have been reading the twilight series and kept telling me to get on board. I started with Twilight and have to say that I was incredibly disappointed until around page 400. The first 400 pages would be a FANTASTIC read for anyone between the ages of 12-17. But the real action is revealed around page 400 once you get past the first love/teen angst focused portion of the book. I have to say that I enjoyed the end of the book so much that I immediately started to read the second book in the twilight series, New Moon. I would recommend Twilight to tweens and teens, but not to anyone in their 20's and beyond."
1,Twilght series,I really enjoyed the books and wanted to purchase them for my kindle. It says I can't get them in the United States and was wondering why that is so. That is disappointing.
3,"Entertaining and ""Incredulous""","This book was written for a teen reading level focusing mainly on the Teen girl ""love obsession"". Stephanie Meyer adds alot of fluff to her writing and over uses the word ""Incredulous"". Reason that i read the book was to see what the hype was about... still havent quite figured it out yet. To be honest, Edward is pretty creepy... watching her at night, dont know why girls get excited about this."
4,twilight,twilight is an excellent book the best i ever read their love in this book isone that every teenagegirl would want to havei would give it higher then five stars it deserves it
5,Love it,I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. The movie made fun of the end of the book though.
4,"Fun Day Read, Later Books get Better!","After much convincing on my teenage sister's part I finally read it. It's a very easy read, I think I read the whole book in about 6 hours. Partly, because it did keep my attention. Yes Bella is a bit annoying on her fragility and her constant obsession on how beautiful Edward is but if you can ignore that and get into the tension between the two characters and romance of it all it's really fun to read. The later books particularily Book 3 ""Ecclipse"", in my opinion is the best of the three books. After reading all four books in about 6 days, I would say don't take it too serious and remember it's a novel for the teen girl. And please!!!! who cares if it's not giving girls the best message, it's a fantasy novel!!!!"
4,good,"The story is engaging but the style of writing is not the best. I read the books once and will continue to follow the series, but won't be rereading the books a second time. It IS worth reading one time at least."
4,Edward is Not as Creepy as Heathcliff,"This is not a vampire book. It is a teenage romance novel where the object of Bella's obsession just happens to be an unconventional vampire. (Snark Alert! If Bella had more life experience, she would know Edward's behavior is much more frightening than his vampirism.)Meyers does a really excellent job of capturing the thrill of smoldering glances, flirting, first kisses, first love. Will this story stand the test of time? I have no idea, but I think it probably will. Edward can't hold a candle to Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights) for creepiness, and women have been crazy about him for centuries."
3,you can get it for less,"The book arrived in time, no problems. I was surprised to see it is much cheaper at TJMaxx the other day."
1,Not the same story!!,"I was very disappointed with THIS version of the story. I have the hardcover version of this book and have read it several times - and LOVED it. However, this kindle version leaves out HUGE chunks of the story. Nowhere in the description did it claim to be an abbreviated version. So why is the story very VERY different?? If you get a chance to read the ACTUAL story - definitely do. Don't waste your time on this kindle version though."
1,The first in the Incredibly Long and Substanceless Book Series,"This book is, as forementioned, increibly long and substanceless. A teenage girl (that really resembles a 7-year-old) falls in love with a vampire, which is the most overused plotline there is. How many books start with this type of introduction, I moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere? All you have to do is read the back and know the whole story. Spoiler: a girl moves to a town in the middle of nowhere, falls for the incredibly ""beautiful"" loner boy with the mysterious air about him (Meyer seems to forget that no man on the face of the earth wants to be called beautiful). Of course he is the vampire, falls for her, reveals that he is a vegetarian vamp, only drinkning aniimals blood, becomes overly protective and kills a vampire that wants to drink her blood. Then theu all live happily ever after the end. I suggest you read real literature such as Harry Potter or The Hunger Games."
2,Only Once,"As the title implies, this book is only good for a one time read for the tolerant reader. As most critics noticed, there is no sense of plot untill the near end of the novel (which in turn was very cut up and dried), the characters themselves seem very…generic in such a way that the reader (mybe surivour) can almost predict what the next event was going to happen, which was either1) Bella's persistant and increasingly annoyong whining2) the prom dress sceneor3) the sparkling vampireand these were just a few examples. Throughout my observence of the books reactions, i find it commen that many individuals of the deranged/immature/illoegical to have enjoyed this novel much."
5,Amazing Read!!,"I am an avid reader. I usually read books by Dean Koontz, John Saul and Stephen King. I have to say this is the ONLY book (or shall I say series) that actually sucked me into it. I read the entire sage (4 books) in one week. I usually do not read like that. I finished these books last night and I am actually thinking of starting over again today. They are amazing. I am not a teenager. I am a married mother of 2 elementary aged boys. So I am not on the ""teenage rampage"". I honestly hope that the author can come up with another set of books like this. The characters are awesome in this story. The humor is great. I would actually catch myself smiling and laughing and I even cried. I can't say enough."
1,Worst piece of garbage ever written,this is one of the worst pieces of garbage ever written. i leave better literary masterpieces in the porcellan goddess every day. only a retard would read this. if you even remotely have a brain you would read anything by jonathan maberry. now hes one of the best writers ever. myers is dumber than a retarded retard. jonathan maberry is very knowledgeable about vampires and other monsters.
3,Good for social gatherings,I recommended this to my fellow book club members and we set up a gathering in the park for a nice social gathering around nooneveryone all started getting snacks and picnic baskets out we even brought marshmallows for later on to roast over a bonfire but it was controlled allot of the books burned real well and made nice sparks very good for kindling I would recommend it for camping trips instead of gathering firewood
3,Yes I am a 22 year old man,"I was skeptical, as I figured this book's audience was geared more towards crushy teenage girls and less for sci-fi readers. Well it actually it totally geared towards these girls, however, I did not put the book down, needing to know what would happen to Bella and if her love interest would change her or kill her off. The book is an easy read, and keeps your interest piqued as you follow the main character's struggle to live a life while dating a vampire. While this is not the best read for a mature audience, a new take on vampires and human interaction is rather refreshing."
2,Twilight,"I liked the storyline of the book, however, could definitely tell it was written for a teenage audience. The story took a long time to develop to the exciting conclusions. Also, I was very dismayed to find that the book skipped the pages between 440 and 473. they simply were not there. This was missing a very important part of the story. Please check your volumes to determine if all the pages are there."
1,I dont get the girls who like this,Ok i havent read the book but lets just say i would probably never read something like this. My ex friend was in love with the series and... Rob Pattison. I am voting one star because I dont want to read it. My teacher read the first one and said it shoulndnt be read by anyone but adults.
1,i want the time that I spent reading this garbage back!!!,"Is impossible for me to call this thing a book, when in reality is nothing more than the poorly written wet dream of an obviously mentally ill and represed woman."
2,please make it stop,"first of all we does edward have to be soo perfect? this book is very shallow nobody is that perfect yes i know its just fantasy but it gives people the idea that there will always be a guy there who will be so deeply in love with you that there won be any problems wrong and maybe there is a guy out there but it may give pople who havent been in love to expect someone as perfect as edward, atleast that was the vibe i got. second of all sense when do vampires shine in the sun seriuosythe positves it did have a great story line and she did do her best and many seem to like it but for this reader it was just sadlastly i think that people who are so obsesed and in love with anything twilight need to find a new book"
2,"Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive...","Wow, Edward is such a god, he's beautiful. He glistens in the sun, and his stare is SO intense. Blah, blah, blah. This book could've been a lot shorter if it didn't repeat the same stuff over and over. I liked it at first, but couldn't take it after page 100 or so. What a disappointment. I don't understand why this is such a craze."
2,"Guys steer clear, definitily one for the girls","I'd heard great things about this book and was expecting something really different to what I got.I've sort of come to think of the book in 3rds. The first third deals with the introduction to the story and lays a few snippets of information. The second third of the book is basically 100 or so pages of Bella describing how beautiful Edward is and how they are both so intoxicated by each others smell. The last part of the book picks up and gets really interesting with possibly the worst closing to a book I've read. Without giving too much away, we hear about how great these vampires are throughout the book and in their moment to shine when the star is in dire peril....it's suddenly a week later....then when it's asked about what happened there's a 1 sentence answer. Biggest Anti-climax ever...Girls, you might like the mills&boon; style romance and pursuit of the perfect boy.Guys, steer clear, don't waste your time."
5,Captivating from the very beginning!,"I ordered Twilight as a book that would get me over the $25 mark for free shipping. Had heard about it briefly but wasn't too eager to buy it before. Boy was I wrong! From start to finish, this book kept me reading (way past my bedtime!!) and the sexual tension between Edward and Bella made me blush! Phenomenally written book that when I was done, I rushed out to by book two (then three and four!!) I had to know what was going to happen to Edward and Bella.I am not ashamed to say that I am a 39 year old mother of two boys that absolutely loved this book. Thanks Stephenie Meyer for making us believe that love truly does conquer all!"
3,"I saw everyone reading it, so I had to give it a go...","Hey, it's not Ann Rice, but it is fun to read and if you are a Twilight fan, you will read it anyway! It was a good 2 hours to finish it.I just finished two very different but very good Vampire books that are very, very good:The House of the VampireandVARNISS THE VAMPIRE: A ROMANCE OF BLOOD"
2,Easy to sum up,"Nothing happened until near the very end. It was an interesting development but I feel anything would have been welcome at that point.Pages and pages (and pages) of Bella gasping over Edward's beauty, Edward warning Bella he is dangerous (huh - not in the bedroom department he isn't)and a depressing teen angst storyline that had me thinking it would end in joint suicide.Edward was vampire 'lite'. He was intriguing but just needed to be a little more lively, sexy, powerful etc for my liking.Bella didn't get why Edward wanted her. Frankly, neither did I."
3,Senior viewpoint,I'm having a hard time getting through this book. It's an exciting fantasy concept but written at a level for teens. It is repetitive and overly romantic. I would have loved it when I was 13-16. In the meantime I was pretty silly to buy it on the basis of its popularity.
3,"juvenile, absurd but ultimately a fun read","High school girl falls in love with a classmate who just so happens to be a vampire. Oh, well ... no one's perfect! Such is the premise we are to accept in plowing through nearly five hundred pages of puppy love and impossibly beautiful (yet suntan deficient) vampires. The love story itself is nauseatingly sweet and completely absurd, yet I suppose junior high school girls will savor every word. However the last couple hundred pages builds up to a Good Vampire vs Bad Vampire battle that is fun to read. It just about salvages the book from being labeled as ""awful"".Bottom line: best left to dewy-eyed girls looking for Mister Right but would settle for Mister Vampire. Not recommended for anyone else."
4,"Kiss each other already, jeez","I have to admit that I struggled with Twilight in the middle. The author seemed to repeat the same tired dialogue between Edward and Bella, refusing to let the plot advance. This book should have been much shorter or their relationship should have progressed beyond the tired high schoolish lines. However, from the trip to Edward's house on, I couldn't put this book down and I can't wait to read the next one."
5,Fantastic read,"This is the first book in a wonderful series. After reading the first chapter, you are hooked. I couldn't put it down. You will fall in love with all the characters. I have reread this many times now. If you like to read for fun...this is the book for you. It will leave you clamering for more....make sure you have access to the next in the series ""New Moon."""
5,great book!,"My husband forced me to go see this movie, I really didnt want to go. We both ended up loving it so much we have seen the movie over 4 times at the theater and both ended up reading all 4 books. This book has enough romance to keep a woman happy and enough action to keep a man happy. I normally read Christian fiction and was happy that there is minimal curse words in all 4 books, so teens could read. As I believe this series was geared towards. There is violence, but it is not grafic or grotesque. You know what happens, but she doesnt go into bllod gorry details about it. I would HIGHLY recommend. This #3 & #4 are probably tied in my vote for the best of the series."
3,Parents should be Aware,"Self-exiled to her least favorite place on the planet, the last thing Bella Swan expects to find is a relationship; but when her boyfriend turns out to be a ""vegetarian"" vampire, she finds herself willingly thrust into a dangerous romance that could claim her life in more than one way.Stephanie Meyer entices the reader's curiosity with her unique take on vampires. The book reads well and the characters are enjoyable, though somewhat shallow. The book focuses on a relationship that, while completely inadvisable and warped in reality, is entertaining and mildly believable in fantasy. Parents should be aware that the book contains the use of medication to induce sleep, manipulative flirting, lying/deception, violent injuries, obsessive adoration/love, and large quantities of sensual physical contact - although the individuals do technically remain chaste.ssbookreviews(dot)blogspot(dot)com"
3,"Exciting read, no depth.","I'm sure you've heard the plot of this book: a teenager girl falls in love with a vampire... obviously there isn't going to be very much depth to this novel.I found the reading fast-paced and attention grabbing, but also annoying. Upon Bella's and Edward's meeting, Bella is totally in love with Edward, willing to give her life for him without even knowing anything about him. I think this is ridiculous, and that the attraction they feel for each other is shallow. They talk about having a relationship before they even know the standards and personality that makes each unique, besides smell of blood and attraction. Maybe I'm just way too opinionated on how a relationship should be approached to really enjoy reading this book.On the flip side, it is a clean read for kids who are into vampires. It's exciting because Bella is constantly dealing with the chance that she could become undead at any moment, and if these make a kid read, it's got my vote."
4,Recommend highly!,"I loved it! The author writes in such a way that just captivates you, and before you know it, you've read the entire book."
1,TWI-TARDS!!!,What is with all the Twi-tards who like reading this crap-ola. Bella is such an idiot. Girls who read this book are idiots. She wants to be turned into a bloodsucking monster. Edward is cold like a dead body. The other dude is a werwwolf that's going to eat eat. The writer is terrible. There is nothing good hear but stuff to burn to keep me warm in the winter. What a waste of my money. I hate this book and everybody who doesn't it an idiot!
5,Keeps you wanting more!,Once I started reading I couldn't stop! And now I can't wait for the next book!!! I read this book faster than I have ever read a book before.
3,"Im too old for this, I think","I was 23 when I read this book and Believe I am too old to enjoy it.It is written poorly, for young children obviously.I dont like the main character Bellaehnot impressed with the story."
5,Love it!,This is by far. My favorite series. I get so wrapped up in it that I feel I'm a part of the book.
3,Twilight book - hardcover,"The book itself was in good shape, but the slip cover was folded in the wrong place, so it sat on the book incorrectly."
4,Surprisingly good,Very well written. Definitely piqued my interest. Having never read or seen the movie I am definitely interested now. Now onto the next book.
5,everything about this book is splendid,"From the cover to the content, i was well satisfied. The story brings you to the world of fantasy and at the same time makes the reader feels like it is possible to happen. Very breathtaking. Once you start reading, you wouldn't stop coz every turn of the page is worthwhile."
5,I'm fascinated by this series!,"I'm 24, and at first I felt silly picking up a series written for young adults. I'm so glad though that I did. This book made me fall in love with reading all over again. Twilight captured my attention and I can't get the words and characters from the book out of my head. It is such a great read, and left me wanting more. I'm now on the third book and I have a hard time putting it down, but yet I have had to make myself slow down because I don't want these books to end. I have fallen in love with Bella, Edward, and the Cullens and will feel as if I have lost friends when the series ends. I wish that there were going to be more! I hope with all my heart that the author will continue writing Midnight Sun (Edward's version of Twilight). I can't get enough of the Twilight Saga! I have been recommending this book to all of my friends, and all that have read it love them as much as I do."
4,Just a quick comment from an original Twilight fan,"Yes, I'm an orginal fan, as in I have been reading the series for a few years now. I'm not a ""twihard"" or whatever, but I have been a fan of the series for a little while. All I want to say is that I'm tired of people talking about how Bella's not a great heroine. All I'm going to say without giving anything away is if you think she's not heroic then read the last book, Breaking Dawn, and tell me if you still feel that way."
4,Liked the Novel,It was a great buy and would buy again if I get the chance to buy again from this seller.
2,Twilight was so boring that...,"...when my mother read part of it to me my mind started wandering and I started thinking about sidewalks. That's right people, SIDEWALKS. Thinking about SIDEWALKS was more exciting to me than listening to twilight. Do you really want to read a book that's less exciting than a flattened piece of rock?"
5,Couldn't put it down,"I remember reading this before it became this world-wide phenomenon. I was over at a friend's house and she purchased this book that day.. I was bored and picked up the book by chance and started reading it and couldn't put it down. Read 2 chapters in and asked to borrow it since it was getting late. Got home, and finished the book at like 2am. I remember just really enjoying the story.On the plus side: it got my friend into reading!"
1,ugh!!!!!!!!!,Just wondering WHY I spent any time reading this? Why did friends lead me astray & say how GREAT the book Twilight was?? If you are a 15 year old girl you might like this otherwise - use your time to read better books.
1,Utterly Painful.......,Slow. Boring. Utterly Painful!!! Count Chockula meets teen Harlequin romance. I finished this one but will not be finishing the series.
2,Interesting at times,"I purchased this book for my niece, but decided to read it before I gave it to her. The story is about a 17-year-old girl named Bella, who falls madly in love with a vampire named Edward.Overall, I wish the story would have been more developed. I think it focuses too much on the sexual attraction between Bella and Edward, and is a bit outrageous with the lengths Bella will go to because of her love for him. I gave it two stars, because at times it is an interesting read. I've decided to hold on to this book until my niece is a bit older. I think the sexual overtones in this relationship is for an older teen. I found their relationship to be a bit dysfunctional. I thought Edward was condescending and almost on the verge of being emotionally abusive. The author never relates that Bella's blind devotion may come from the supernatural powers a vampire may have over a human. The reader is led to believe that Bella's crazy behavior is because of true love. I did not like that message."
2,Good grief,"Uh, yeah. I have NO idea why I read this. I'm 28. I guess I was interested because it takes place in Washington. I'm not going to go real in- depth with this review. The book was not well written at all, but you do need to take into consideration the age range it's channeled towards. I might have liked it more if i was 12 or 13. I just thought it was too cheesy. Edward and Bella are both pretty pitiful, and majorly lacking in the personality department. The book was basically a lot of banter back and forth, and the ending was not even a tiny bit satisfying. The only reason why I gave this two stars was because I did make it all the way through the book.I kept waiting for something amazing to happen (don't ask me why). Lesson learned- no more teenage vampire romance novels for me!"
5,Amazing,"I absolutely love the Twilight movies, I just had to read the books. I must say I am even more in love with each of these characters now! I can't wait to read the rest of the series now."
5,Wow,At first I was unsure about reading this after so many bad reviews but I can honestly say that I loved this book however I did think that some parts were lacking and the words were repetitive but overall I suggest you read it find out for yourself
5,Loved it (:,This book was on very good condition exactly what I had ordered couldn't be more pleased. One of my favorite orders
1,How is this popular?,"This was a lame story with bad writing. How is this popular? Bella is whiney and annoying, the shiny vampire thing was silly, and the pace of the book is so slow! Nothing ever happens! Even for the young adult genre, the prose was horrible and choppy.If you're looking for a good vampire book, I would recommend going old school and reading Anne Rice. I really enjoyed Interview with the Vampire."
2,Am I the only one who fell asleep?,"This book bored me into a deep, sound sleep. I made it four chapters in before I gave up. I tried again a few months later. Same thing. Fell asleep reading it. Maybe I'll try again the next time I have insomnia. Better than any other sleep remedy, I've found."
1,$150? are you crazy?,"please- go to Wal-Mart and buy the book for $13, or go to any one of the other sellers for this book and buy it from $10-13. I think that this seller needs to be removed. Selling this book for $140 more than it's retail value is robbery."
2,Not for audiences over the age of 18!,"I was really interested in reading this after hearing many positive things about the author and series. I like vampire tales and hoped this would be like an edgy Harry Potter, with fangs. Sadly, I got a 12 year old girl's diary which read like a cheesy romance novel for the tween set. Almost nothing happened and the most action happened off page. Not good. Sorry."
1,Hmmm,"Is it just me or is this book written so simply it hurts. Bella the main character seems to obey and let Edward push her around, growl at her and such, and these two are meant to be so devastatingly in love that it is the greatest love story.... I'm reading New Moon now and am finding it even worse. It's ok .. but I don't know if its worthy of the obsession."
4,An Intriguing Story,"Bella Swan has always loved her native phoenix. But when her mother gets re-married to a traveling baseball player, Bella feels as though she is tying her mother down. She chooses to move to Forks, Washington, where her police chief father lives. While her new classmates seem enthralled with the new, mysterious girl, she feels like she doesn't fit in. The only person who isn't friendly is Edward Cullen, her handsome biology partner.Although he tries to avoid her, he seems to turn up when ever she is in trouble. He seems to be able to do things that are not possible. He eventually reveals his secret. He and his family are vampires. Knowing this secret and spending time with Edward put Bella in danger that she may not survive.This is the best of the series and none of the others quite measure up."
5,Wasn't sure at first... however...,"At first, i wasn't interested in these books. It wasn't until i had a vampire lit class in college that opened my eyes to the Twilight series. I aboslutely love them. I could not put the books down. I read all four in a month. The only thing that i don't like is the wolf thing and how the fourth book focuses on Jacob. Given what it was about, i feel she should have had something in there from Edward's point-of-view. Overall, love them!!!"
5,Brilliant name,"This book is brilliant. i think anyone who likes vampires, romance, and action should read this book. it's one of the most popular books in the world. it's better than the movie i can tell you that for sure. so you absolutely haft to read this book."
1,Couldn't get past page 6.,"Wanted to like this book, as an old vampire fan from ages past, but was put off by Bella producing enough angst over her morning breakfast to submerge my basement.I like my vampires with that traditional Nosferatu edge sans sparkles.Wasn't my cuppa."
2,Waste of time,"I'm giving this two stars because it was a page turner. However, it lacked in every respect. Flimsy characters, MIA plot, substandard writing and there's no ""there"" there. You end this book with no additional insignts into the human condition, nothing learned, no thoughts provoked, just time wasted turning empty pages.If you want to read hundreds of pages describing how handsome sparkly vampires are, this is the book for you. Otherwise, it makes a good doorstop."
2,"Not bad, but too emo.","I love paranormal books and romance doesn't bother me, but Bella was very unlikeable to me. I know people absolutely love the Twilight series, but I really wasn't very impressed. What I will say is, Meyer's view of Vampires is unique, and I did like the idea of good vampires. Although feeding on animals or criminals is not a unique concept, the whole glittering emo thing was different. I do enjoy when a writer develops the emotional aspect of the characters in the story, but I have to say, this series pretty much went over my limit. Of all the books in the series, this one was tolerable."
1,Terrible,"I cannot stress how much I hated this book. I finished it just to see if it was terrible all the way till the end, and it was.Bella Swan is a terrible character and Edward Cullen is even worse. I cannot believe how much people love this book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Why is everyone so impressed by this book?,"Don't get me wrong - she's a competent writer, her prose flows smoothly and she has a deft hand with description. But the plot? It offers nothing new to the vampire fantasy genre - fantasy and vampire lovers would be far better off reading Robin McKinley's Sunshine. And the conflict of whether or not to live forever? It's been done before, Tuck Everlasting would be an example, and Meyer's book has nothing new to say on the subject. The book is enjoyable, the main character sympathetic, but ultimately it failed to hold my interest or to say anything truly original. A disappointment."
1,Unreadable,"I found no point in going beyond the first sentence: ""My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down."" The modifier ""with the windows rolled down,"" as all modifiers should, should be positioned next to what it is modifying. Here it is modifying ""airport."" How does this airport have its windows rolled down? Why? Is an airport with retractable windows really meant, or is Meyer just a really bad writer? Apparently the latter. Ms. Meyer should have paid attention in her high school composition classes, for she apparently learned very little in them. If she cannot even get the crucial opening sentence right, one abandons all hope for the others in the middle of this ""book."""
2,momsread,"My daughter expressed a deep interest in these books so I took one with me on a biz trip to preview. I would not say that I was disapointed, I knew it was TL in the first place, but I was really surprised at how week the main character was portrayed. She takes no responsibility for herself or her own emotions, relying instead on others to lift her up and to make her circumstances more bearable. She is further portrayed as klutzy, accident prone with low self-esteem and instead of the author developing Bella's strengths, it seems she focuses on developing her dependence on a boyfriend, again to solve her problems for her and save her from herself.I discussed a few of these topics with my daughter but urged her to read it for herself. She thought it would have been a brilliant story, had Bella become a stronger person too, instead of resigning herself to whatever fate (joy with boyfriend, doom without) doled out for her. Sparkly Vampires??? This one had us both in stitches....."
1,BORING and ANNOYING,"I don't think I can even finish this book. Bella could be the most boring main character. There is no basis for their ""love."" All she cares about is how beautiful he is. Give me a break. The writing is even worse. The words that I must have found on every other page include sinuous, breath, and beautiful. It's like the writer took her thesaurus and wrote the same thing over and over again in different words. Do not buy this book. I wish I could give it zero stars"
5,"I love this book, you will too","Twilight is such a good book. You don't have to be a vampire fan to read it [trust me I wasn't a vampire fan, but now I AM!!!!]. Being written very well, combined with romance and danger, makes it the best book possibly made! I can't wait until the sequels come out and I hear that she's writing TWILIGHT from the point of view of Edward...hm that'll be really interesting!"
5,couldn't put it down!!,"Twilight was definitely the best book I've read in years. I read it all in one day. I'm a fan of Buffy too which kind of drew me towards buying this book in the first place. The dialogue and sarcasm was great. I lost myself in the humour and love story of the book. The quick paced plot keeps you at the edge of your seat and wanting to read more. I can't wait for the sequels!! Two thumbs up, great novel."
3,Teenage angst overshadows what IS a great story.....,"I bought this for my 17 year old neice, trying to bribe her to do laundry. She was so completely engrossed in this book (alas, the laundry did not get done for two days!), I thought I'd give it a go. Granted, I am not the target audience, but I enjoy my share of YA fiction. It was a great story but I could do with out the angst. A little angst would be all right but pages and pages of it got a little dull. Bella and Edward didn't really ""fall in love"" either, he kind of smelled her, and she looked at his pectorals.However, the premise is dynamite, and worth sifting through the muck to get at the grit of the story. Entertaining read, I will most likely read the rest of the books in the series."
3,"Not the worst, but not the best either.","I generally don't understand all of these 5 star reviews on Amazon, they are usually WAY off. They are once again misleading. This is a decent read -- I liked it -- but it was in no way exceptional. Some parts are even irritating in their simplicity -- stuff just conveniently happens, with no depth or realism. I was also disturbed by Edward's bullying. While, I think, the female species tends to like dominant males, we don't like jerks. A man can be capable, and even assertive, without crossing the line. Edward reads a little bit like a lunatic, at times.I love fantasy, and I've developed some sort of infatuation with vampire novels, so I will continue with this series. I hope it gets better."
3,"Love Vamps, wish it was better written","OK. So as a vampire fan I got tired of hearing people say, ""You really need to read Twilight."" Well, I have, and while I found it entertaining, the writing was poor, but I guess I need to remember this stuff is really YA."
1,bad behevior,iv never read the and i just rated it whatever.but all i wanted to say was some of these people giving bad reports and saying or mimicking something from the bible... thats unexepecteble.i believe God should have His respect.im not joking.and if you think im like thirty your wrong... im only ten!!!!!!
5,THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK NO MATTER whatyou say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the first chapter boo kI could actually sit through. the movie was dumb, sure, but the book is the best thing ever!!! I may have been onl in fourth grade when I read this but seriously all those one stars! How could anybod y not like this I have read it over 50 times and have lost it only 100! The love between the characters is totally awe worthy! How could no one like this book how!? It is not the books or authors fault that everyone makes fun of it! And that is only because of the movie! Not Twights fault! Listen to me here, if you havent read this book yet read it. You dont have to buy it you could just go to a friends and borrow it or the library. Whereever you get it dont base it off of the bad reviews because many people like it. It is not like the whole world hates it.Remember this is a good book! And, also, BYE!!!!"
1,bad book,so boring vampires used to be cool go team wolf kid or what everthis is my grandpahave a nice day
1,"Boring, Boring and did I mention Boring!!!",I read this book to see what all the hype is about. To be honest this book was very boring. The story line is too predictable. It is a story about a 17 year old girl in love. This book has about as much suspense as watching car rust. This book would have been a good read if you are a 15 year old girl. If you are anything more than a teen then read something written for an adult. The Anne Rice vampire books are a hundred times better and will keep you interested. It was all I could do to finish.
1,The Blandest Fare of Vampire Fetish,"Oh my god, Stephanie Meyer's Twilight saga is the whiniest, most intolerably annoying book I've read all summer. It features protagonist Isabella Swan who is paradoxically stubborn and endlessly self-deprecating to the point of nausea. The bulk of the book is Meyer's/Swan's vapid sophmoric prose attempting to render the superlative ecstasy and terror of immortality and vampire love.I can't keep a civil tone, so I'll end this review. Barf barf barf barf"
1,My Brain is Melting,"How? Why? Yes yes vampires have flesh as hard as marble. How about an original thought? The constant mentioning of her hair was numbing. Any teenage girl that is not only the new kid, but also the best looking knows it - come on. Boring."
4,Good Story,"I saw the movie before the book, didn't understand what all the hype was about. However, I caved and decided to try the book after seeing the various reviews of it. I like the authors style of writing and found the story easy to follow. I did feel the relationship between Bella and Edward was a little rushed, but other than that the book kept my interest much better than the movie did."
2,So overrated,"This is truly one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The author uses incredibly basic sentence structures that really distracted me from the story. It really felt like it was written by a junior high kid, at best. The story itself is interesting, but the main character, Bella, I found immensely unlikeable. When I finished the book, I was actually upset with myself that I wasted so much time."
1,The only thing worse than vogan poetry...,"has officially been written.Cut the prologue. (You're just setting up a false climax that your heroine is unconscious for anyway).On page 5: ""It ws to Forks that I now exiled myself--an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks."" Okay, first, you don't ""exile yourself"" you either ""go"" or you ""are exiled by others.""Understand, the basic stupidity of this sentence, please."
1,Boring,I honestly cannot understand how this book became so popular. It is so boring and ridiculous! The story gets so fake at times that it is absolutely painful to continue reading. I definitely won't be reading the other books that follow.
1,Badly written with an irresistable plot for teens,"It makes VC Andrews (if you are old enough to remember those books) read like high literary prose. I'm sure I would have loved these at 12 or 13 - what teenaged girl can resist this plot of an unearthly gorgeous 17 year old vampire (who is also wildly rich) in love with a mortal girl in high school? It is so badly written, so full of cliches and corny metaphors and forced events that I ended up scanning passages hoping for decent morsels to read. The Potter books at least had some decent writing and dealt with larger issues. Still, any girl 17 and under is going to devour these books."
3,Not a bad book and it's a fast read,"I liked Twilight quite a bit. I liked how smooth the writing was. It was almost an effortless read. My only problem with the book is that the author seemed to forget that some sort of conflict needed to occur in order to make the story interesting. For about three hundred pages or so, we got to read about how beautiful and amazing and dangerous Edward is. Then all of the sudden the conflict with ""The Tracker"" occurs and is handled in about 100 pages. This conflict seemed to be kind of thrown in the book and could have been developed much earlier leaving out some of the silly crush/ love parts of the story without losing any quality to the book.Overall, it was a fun book and I am planning on reading the entire series."
2,Fun Fluff,"As fluff goes, this was an entertaining tale of teenage love/angst. This series was a guilty pleasure as I have read all four books. However, if you are looking for great writing with deep meaning, get something else. Really, this is a book for tweens, don't expect Shakespeare. I would have rated it a three star fluff book except for the author's disturbing decision to have her heroine constantly express her inferiority to the male leads. I am not pretty enough, I am not worthy, etc. Give me a break!"
4,It's rare for a teen title to be so well crafted and the dialogue so adult and inviting.,"This was really interesting and intelligent book, aside from the many misnomers about my home state of Washington, and some issues that were not fully developed like Bella's attraction of danger and near death experiences hopefully the next two installments will explore these issues. I loved this book despite of those flaws and I am anxious to engage in one of the sequels. It's rare for a teen title to be so well crafted and the dialogue so adult and inviting. I think the size and subject matter will put off some teens but those that pick it up will not be able to put it down, nor will they be able to stop wondering what will be come of Bella in the next book."
1,It felt like I was reading a tween girl's diary.,"Considering all the hype surrounding this series, I thought I was in for a treat. I read The Host by S. Meyer and I thought it was tolerable and I presumed this would be a substantially better read. I was wrong.I found that I didn't care at all about the girl or the super cute boy who was mean to her. I'll admit to being a 30 year old man, and would suggest that other 30 year old men only read this if you want to understand the content of what your children are reading. But beware... your brain will hurt."
5,Brillian Book,"I actually saw the movie first and I like it so much I've bought the book too and my money was never wasted 'coz the book actually offers more. It is one of those books that you wouldn't want to put down and you just want to know what happens next. The excitement is too much when you read it, I pictured the characters in my mind and It's so amazing. The book is not very hard to understand especially for me who doesn't read a lot. I don't understand some words so I keep a dictionary close to me (I'm a Filipina) This is the book for people who wants to be entertained. For those who are young at heart. when you read it just let it go, don't fight it then you will enjoy it 'coz i was thinking that for people who forgot how to feel 17 again it sounds corny...you know those mature thinking, cannot be pleased type of people. I can't ever write a bad review about this book. I absolutely LOve it."
2,"After viewing the movies, had to see how Twilight Book 1 set it up","I'm one of the few fans of book adaptions to movies - how Grisham's The Firm translated, Angels and Demons, etc. With Twilight, which of course is already a global franchise, I had to go back to the beginning.My take is that the director, Catherine Hardwick, who directed the ""Twilight"" movie, really boiled the ocean here, creating tight characters, setting up the high school and town as best possible. I had to shake my head when she read the 'vampire softball' game scene though, as the implausibility or even rationale for ageless ""teens"" playing softball seemed very corny.I wonder if Hardwick hadn't directed ""Twilight"" if the series would have stayed as long. Again, interesting YA model of writing from Mormon author, but very lucky to have a strong female director own the first book."
5,I loved the books before the movies came out,"I read the Twilight series before the movies were in production. It isn't for everyone but I really enjoyed the books. However, I had totally different characters in my head than the ones in the movies, made from my own translation of the descriptions provided in the book. The ones in my head were a lot better."
2,The Audio Book,"Pretty much everyone knows the story of Twilight. Bella (weak human with good smelling blood) falls in love with Edward (strong vampire who wants Bellas blood) and problems follow.My gripe is the lady who reads Twilight on the audio book. The way she reads the book, enunciates the words and...pretty much everything....is horribly distracting and downright annoying.Save your money. The movie is easier to sit through then this lady reading the book. And thats definitely saying something."
5,Lakshakie!!!!! Woo Hoo!!!!,"I love this book series. New, inventive, creative, read series in 3 days and started all over again. I'm rereading it for the 3rd time. Mom takes the books away to punish me. That is the only way for me to be grounded. And each time I cry. Rataksha boo lakaa boo."
4,Vampire Love is Never Easy,I read a lot of good reviews of this series and I have to say that I did enjoy this book. I used to be a big fan of the Vampire Lestat series and like Buffy and Angel and other vampire-related media. This was a quick read and interesting too--the first true vampire romance I have read. I will probably read the entire series.
4,Great distraction from everyday life,"This book is full of mystery, romance, and a little bit of the dark side. Okay, maybe a LOT of the dark side. It is not a typical choice of reading material for me, but I am so glad that I finally picked up a copy. I lost a lot of sleep, because I literally could not stop reading! On book 3 now....can't wait to see what happens!"
5,Great Buy,"Fast delivery, product beter then expected, Good price, would do business with again, AAAA++++ Seller"
3,Good Start,"It's a different spin on vampires and it is about the romance. I like how old school Edward is and not just his values, but just the feel of him. I don't think they capture that in the films. This book is waaaay better than the movie. I do kind of think Bella is a Mary Sue, but I think the beauty of her character is that all the fangirls can insert themselves into this life and fall in love with such a handsome and romantic vampire!When Bella was figuring out the whole ""vampire"" thing, it took a while. It seemed like it took her a while to even research it and in this day and age, why would you even need to research it? Then when she discovered so much about their world, that was also taken piece by piece and at times I thought it moved along slow, but I was still very interested to read about Edward's world.I think Stephanie Meyer has the right to create her different version of the vampire. It might not be ""hardcore"" but I like that it's different."
2,UGH,"I really hate romance, but my mother insisted on buying me a copy. She found it on sale and knew I loved vampires. I could hardly make it through this book. I think I'll pick up my copy of Dracula and wash the bad taste out of my mouth."
3,Just Ok,"3 stars.I read this about 2-3 years ago, I bent to the hype and tried it out. Didn't think it was amazing by any stretch of the imagination but there are worse ways to spend a couple afternoons.I liked the book. I by no means loved the book.My biggest problem with the book is the character of Bella. She's far too attached to Edward and can't stop talking/thinking about how beautiful he is. I get it, he's attractive and she's attracted to him, move on please.The secondary characters were more interesting to me than the two main ones. I was interested in Rosalie and Emmett and their stories.I was entertained during the time it took to read it, even though I didn't like Bella. Despite the length it was a quick read, the story flowed nicely, and I was interested enough to read the next book New Moon."
4,"Entertaining, not earth shattering","While this book may have been cheesy and unrealistic, it was easy and entertaining. I don't make a habit of over analyzing YA books, I try to take them for their face value and that's what I did with this book. I had fun reading this book between some of my heavier material and that is what I look for in a book :)As far as all of the people who want to argue ""Vampires don't sparkle!"" blah blah blah... Vampires aren't real, Stephenie Meyer is an author who can write whatever she wants in to her novels, so get over it."
2,Good if you don't think about what you're reading,"I first started reading the Twilight saga when I was about thirteen, and I loved it. A few months later, I realized my mistake.Bottom line? This book would be pretty good as a drinking game. Take a shot every time Bella describes Edward as ""flawless"" or ""perfect"" or some other fanciful something. If you can hold your alcohol, you might last twenty pages."
5,Love story!!,This is the most beautiful love story ever written!!!! Its a story about what brings her to find this love of her life...and its sooooo beautifully written about her love for Edward!!!
3,A new lover of books born!,"I bought this series for my daughter who is 12. She has NEVER been a reader and I was trying my best to light a spark. It worked!!! She finished all four of them in a month and is now asking for MORE! That alone makes me a fan. Stephenie Meyer inspired at least one little girl to love to read and for me, her mother, that makes the book a success.Personally, I read the book and found it slow and the characters a little flat/bland. If I hadn't had the other three and moved from one to the next and the next, I would have thought the book was a complete waste for an adults reader. However, the story builds and builds in each one and by the end I couldn't put them down. The series as a whole was well worth reading but this book alone was weak."
3,Why did I ever like this so much?,"First of all, I find many of these reviews quite hilarious and in agreemnt of. When I first read this book (at the age of 15 no less) I fell in love. Now at the age of 18 armed with way more maturity and having read many other romance novels, I find this book very annoying and unnrealistic of any type of true love. Dont get me wrong, it is a great read, but having reread it now, I felt it was a struggle to get though the book or even get into the story. Maybe its just that Twilight is so overdone now compared to what it was a couple of years ago that it just annoyed me so much more. I found Edward creepy and arrogant, and Bella was so awkward that it irritated me. Reading it now makes me realize how young you have to be to really enjoy this romance. Overrall 3 stars, and a novel I will never likely read again."
3,I don't get it.,"I respect what Stephanie Meyer has created. I also do not get it. But I can't knock Twilight's resonance with the teen set. So, I bow my head with respect to her accomplishment."
5,Can't put it down!,"Once you get past the fact that the book is written for teenage girls, it sucks you in and holds your undivided attention, even after you finish it. It is a compelling love story that is woven into the action and suspense. It's difficult not to race to the bookstore to pick up the 2nd and 3rd books in the saga when you're done with it!"
4,a vamiric love story,"Twilight a vamiric love storyIn this vampiric love story Bella a thin pale girl from phoenix Arizona, moves to forks to live with her father. Forks is a small town on the Olympic peninsula.Bella is the only new girl in a small high school, where she meets Edward. Who is a tall very white & muscular vampire? At first Edward tries to avoid Bella only to find he cant stay away from her.Bella and Edward spend more and more time together. One night out, the first night out was all wrong for them. Now James& his coven of 2 other vampires are now after Bella. Can Edward save Bella or will this be the end.This book caught my attention when every one was reading it soon enough most teens in the U.S. were reading it. I would recommend this book for any one who loves a good romance fansity."
5,Absolutely my favorite book (series) of alllllll time!,"There really aren't words to describe how much I LOVE this entire series.All I can say is READ IT.But keep in mind:-you WILL fall in love with edward.-no other boy or book will EVER be the same after reading.oh and it's hard to believe, but the books just keep getting better!"
4,I could NOT put it down!,"This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down!! This book is like a romance novel for teens. One can sortof geus what is going to happen, but I felt like I just had to know if my assumption was right! You just get so attached to the characters! If Bella was sad in the story, i was depressed all day until I found time to read it again! Meyer just describes everyone so well that you can't help but become part of the story, part of the characters! Just read it, I would bet 50$ that you love it as much as I do! =]"
5,Much Love for Meyer's Twilight Saga!!!,This was the begining of a very beautiful relationship! One that went by far to quickly! Stephanie Meyer is engrossing!! I couldnt put the books down!!! All who read these are sure to enjoy them! My only hope is that there will be more to come.... =)!
5,Loved this book!,"I liked vampire books before this one, but it's not something I picked up right away. After seeing the hype literally EVERYWHERE (especially online) I decided to give it a try and pick it up. Seriously COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN once I started reading it. Needless to say, love love LOVED the book and everyone should give it a chance."
4,"good, but very unrealistic","I really liked the book, but often found myself questioning it. The romance between Edward and Bella developes so quickly that it seems superficial, and sickening."
3,3.5 - Twilight from the not so YA point of view,"Well, I am certainly well beyond YA years. Twilight was given to me as a gift and after seeing the movie I thought, ""Why not?"". So, I picked up the book, sat down on a misty, cool morning and started to read over hot coffee.The book was entertaining enough that I ""could not put it down""; however the characters left me wanting more. The book is very well written but I missed the depth of the main characters. I found myself being sucked in to the not-so-main characters based on their one-liner sentences.--skipping full description of the book, because if you don't know that it's about vampires, then I just can't help you.I will admit, that I enjoyed the book and hold a silent hope that Ms. Meyers will maybe take a look into her ""Foster Parents"" (the Cullens) and write an adult based series from their point of view (for those of us who are just a (ahem) tad bit older."
5,amazing!,"When the book first came out, all my friends read it and told me to read it but, I hated the whole vampire in love idea. Then, when another friend sat me down and made me read, I LOVED it! One of the most captivating books I have ever read!"
5,Easy reading,The text is not too small and flow is easier to read than expected. Brand new book that even my 10year old can enjoy though we havn't read it all yet.
5,twilight movie,"i personally love this book and it's sequals. i can't wait for breaking dawn to come out, but i don't like the idea of a movie. it's nice to see how it all play's out, and what stephenie meyers view of it all looks like. i'm sure not to perfection though, but with the book, you get make up how everything looks on your own, and i frankly don't like some of the actors and actresses that are playing certain people. it almost ruins my whole view of the book. especially edward. some of the actors are soooo much cuter. he's one of the main characters, and i know that no actor is probably as glorious as i'm imagining edward is in the book, but i still think that there could be one better than the one that was picked. that's just my opinion though."
2,Total piece of crap,"Started out good, but it all went downhill from there, from the random ""drama/action"" sequence to the predictable ending. The characters were thoroughly unlikable and flat, and might I emphasize the word CLICHE. Hey, I don't hate on people for liking it, it's the rabid Twilight fans that continually feel the need to bash anyone who states an opinion opposite from their own, that really tick me off, even though they are clearly too unintelligable to see the MAJOR FLAWS in this sorry excuse for a novel.My advice: read the book anyway, but do not let cruel reviews like mine bias your reading, nor let the floods of gushing illiterates cloud your view of the book's true worth.Also, I'm sorry that I didn't elaborate much in this review. Many of the other low-raters were able to write eloquent diatribes that describe Twilight's flaws better than I ever could. Thanks for considering my opinion. =P"
1,"wow, this was dreadful reading...","As many have already echoed, this book is very amateurish and leaves little to the imaginiation. I couldn't help but get irritated with the writing style, which was obviously aimed at teenagers. It also seemed like an homage to Anne Rice's Interview With A Vampire books, except written by a hack. If this is what it takes to get published then the literary world is in a lot of trouble. Avoid at all costs."
1,Didn't care for this story,Alot of people are raving about this book that was the reason I bought it to see what it was all about especially since the movie is coming out. I was very disappointed with the story. Everything revolved around Bella and she was such a clutz. Also when she and Edward declare themselves it was just too unrealistic.Don't think I will continue the series.
3,A great scam,"I actually liked this book (well a little). As a high school teacher, I've watched my students carrying this book and discussing it like the latest teen idol. OMG - what a teen fantasy - the new girl in town, not very pretty (well she claims - but why are all of the boys trying to date her). Bella is the Mary Sue fantasy done to life - plenty of teen angst and even the most different, richest boy in town MUST HAVE HER NOW! A cute book, but not worth the blather."
2,Teenage-Vampire Romance For Teenagers Only,"I'm not sure if Stephanie Meyer is trying to be the new Anne Rice here, but she has created her own world - a world where vampires glow! The first 3rd of the book was boring, dealing with the daily life of insecure Bella. The novel only got interesting where Bella was introduced to the Cullens and the subsequent fight with another hunter vampire from another coven, who was hunting her.If you're into teenage romance and daily life events that are repeated over and over again or if you want to relive your high school days, this book is for you, otherwise, I don't think this novel is mature enough for adults to read, it just seems rather retarded in the romance and emotional department.A movie is in the making though, starring Robert Pattison (Cedric Diggory) & Kristen Stewart. I wonder if they will portray the female character Bella as weak, insecure and needy - that will be sad!"
1,Dracula 90210,"Stephenie Meyers novel marks a steep decline for the vampire genre. No thanks. Give me real creatures of the night, and preferably ones who are at least adults. Twilight Twi-bites, and not in a good way. Recommended for tweens only."
1,Just glad I didn't have to pay for it,"This book stinks. The fact that people are happy that this book is encouraging young people to read, while it promotes an abusive relationship as ""true love"", is reprehensible."
1,Biggest waste of my life.,"Seriously, save your money and time and buy something else. This whole series (not just the first book) reads like bad fanfiction from a 13 year old girl who has never even HEARD of vampires. I'm sorry, but a person who sparkles in the sunlight, only eats animals and doesn't have fangs is not a vampire. It's a friggen PIXIE.You want a book with action, suspense, 3D/believable characters? Won't get it here."
1,I tried to enjoy it....but was unsuccessful,"I gave it a chance and read the first 150 pages. I finally had to end my pain and put it down. Not being a female, I was hoping that it would somehow give me an insight on the life of teenage girls and their time in high school. Unfortunately, it was at best shallow and often cringe inducing. Please spend your reading time on something better."
2,"yes, he's a handsome vampire","Title says it all... and that's what 60% of the book is about.The vampire is handsome.And just in case we didn't mention it, the vampire is handsome.Oh... let's throw in some action at the end to kinda-sorta have a story...Please don't hate me, I read the book, I just didn't like it so much.In an ironic twist, the movie was better."
5,Fabulous book!,"I LOVED this book! I only read it as a recommendation from my sisters. I had no idea it was about vampires which is not my normal reading. But this book was so good, I couldn't put it down and immediately re-read it when I finished the first time. I loved the characters Stephenie wrote about and loved the romance between Edward and Bella. This book draws not only teenagers into the story, but us adults as well. I have recommended the book to friends and they loved it too. The sequel is just as good and I'm looking forward to the 3rd book coming out in August. I hope the story never ends, as long as Edward exists in this world!!"
4,Fabulous!,"Like many other people mentioned, I too was afraid to buy this book due to the Young Adult label. I was even a little embarassed when I had to ask a sales associate for help locating the young Adult section in the bookstore. By the first chapter all of that was washed away and I felt like a fool for being so silly. This book drew me in from the very beginning and left me wanting more. So much so that within an hour I was at the bookstore buying New Moon and Eclipse so that I would not have to stop in between books. I can't wait to get home tonight to begin the 2nd book."
5,Unexpectedly wonderfully,"At the bookstore, I was only drawn to this book because it was so thick (I love a long read). Unfortunately, I later discovered from the back cover that it was a book about vampires. I'd never had any interest in vampires, so I put off reading it until I had absolutely nothing else to do. What a fool I was! It was easily one of the best books (out of hundreds, I assure you) I have ever read. I couldn't put it down; I couldn't sleep without knowing what was going to happen next. Even if you're not a vampire person, read this book and, like me, you will be overwhelmed by how great it is."
5,Twilight is awesome!,I honestly could not put this book down. It's full of romance and excitement. I love it! It definitely leaves you wanting more. Good thing there are three sequels!
3,jewel2581,"I absolutely loved the Twilight saga. I bought the collector's edition to replace my tattered paperback. It cost the same as the regular hardcover (on amazon). I love the black on black scroll design, the built in bookmark and the case it comes in. What I do not like is that there isn't an optional sleeve to cover the cloth cover, and I guess I expected more. Like a nicer bookmark, or for it to have a dust jacket, etc."
3,42yo woman a tad bored,"First. I'm a 42yo female. You might think...why on earth are you reading Twilight? This would be fair. I would say, hey, I'm still occasionally hip, and I'm not quite ready to write off a couple generations of good folks, so I want to know what all this flippin hype is about. My conclusion: these post-potter-philes needed something a bit other-worldly to sink their teeth into (pun intended). The book would have been pretty fun to read if it had been 50% as long. I got so sick of hearing about people's skin color and temperature during the falling-in-love scenes that I started doing crunches while reading just to make better use of the slowly passing time.A bit lugubrious at times and (since mentioned earlier) nowhere near the superb use of language, scene and character these young adults found in the Potter books, it's a fine read.Will I read the rest. No chance. But at least now I know what everyone younger than me and female is talking about."
1,I tried!,"I tried to enjoy this book, I really did. When I didn't, I read the second book to see if the story would get a little more involved and in-depth. It doesn't. How much ridiculous teen angst can be packed into one story? ""Oh, I love you but I can't be with you!"" Oh, I think I may vomit.While Meyers adds some new ideas to vampire mythology, she isn't doing anything for the teenage brains this book is targeted at. A laundry list of an average teenage life is not going to captivate many readers, and the constant pull and tug of the protagonist's relationship with Edward (the weirdly obsessed vampire) is frankly annoying. If I was a friend of Bella Swan's I would have to slap her to her senses."
5,amazing!,this book and the entire saga that follows is truely amazing. after reading the books i was at a loss to fid something new to read after because it seemed that nothing could be as good. this series really is the best ive read in quite some time. go stephanie meyers!
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!,"I loved this book. It is such an incredible unbelievable story. I was hooked immediately! I got it on CD and donated it to our local library. I have encouraged all avid readers to get the series and bury themselves in it for awhile. I am a grandmother and enjoyed it, I liked that it had romance without sex. So it's safe for younger audiences."
5,wonderful,I love this book so much that I was unable to put it down. I carried this book almost everywhere.
2,Not Worth Biting Into,"Twilight is as bad as my cliche title to this review. I found myself skipping pages in hopes of finding something interesting written by Stephanie Meyer. I only started reading it to see what all the hype is about and now I am realizing the power groups of 12 year old girls have over the media. Almost as much power as Edward Cullens mesmerizing gaze - the one thing I think that really gives him appeal - and merely because you have no choice in the matter. If this is what a ""good read"" has come to, I am not sure how I will survive the rest of my life. Please, mass media, you've already came and imposed your uneducated, uncultured, uninteresting self upon the theatre, don't ruin literature too!"
5,Hooked on Twilight... like the rest of the world.,"Well, there really isn't much more that I can say that hasn't been said in the other reviews. I really enjoyed readying the Twilight Saga and I have started to read it again last week. All the books were great, well Breaking Dawn was ""ok"". I love the characters and the way it sucks you and doesn't let go. Its like my mind is trapped in the Twilight universe and I can't get out..."
3,NO Vampires in a book ABOUT Vampires,"Ok. So this book was good over all, but I gave it 3 stars because throughout most of the book, it didn't have much about vampires. Edward Cullen and his family didn't show up till about 3/4 of the way through it. The book was mostly about Bella, and her going back and forth from school, and having homework and cooking dinner. It didn't live up to the title of a New York Times Bestseller. I was disappointed. Now on the other hand, once the action and romance started picking up it was a page turner and if the whole book was like the end it would have gotten a 5 star review from me easily. I would still recommend this book because all of the rest of the saga is very good, actually amazing and worth the time."
5,Love it,The book captures the reader from the beginning. I liked watching the movie n going back to the book and rereading it again n knowing the book is so much more detailed than the movie. Of course I know u cant put everything from the book into the movie but its fun to pick out the movie in the book
3,Shocked it was pretty good,"Even though Twilight is a thick book it is a very easy and fast read. I read it the course of 3 days during my free time. I was shocked that I like it. I gave it 3 stars because I thought it was pretty good, but not the end all be all of Vampire Romance Novels. I finally forced myself to read it because EVERYONE I knew had read the Twilight books and were talking about how amazing they are. So finally I read it. It was good (as I stated before) but I still have yet to read the other books. It didn't make me rush out and want to by them. All and all it was a fun book."
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book for the preteen and teen. My daughter has the set and loves them, she reads them over and over again."
5,good set,"The story line was one that pulled you in, and made you not able to put it down. I liked the whole series."
1,"""Interview"" for Idiots","I suppose something can be said for it if it gets young people to read, but really. Let's make sure we (& most especially the author) understand that ""Bestseller"" just means ""Most popular"" & really doesn't have much to do with quality. I thought the writing was pretty shabby. Dust ""moats?"" Come on. It was as if they were all in such a hurry to get it to press so they could start raking in the big bucks, they didn't even bother to edit the thing. If I ever see the word ""shattered"" again before I die it will be way too soon.The best purpose it could possibly serve for young people would be as a stepping-stone to Anne Rice."
2,I just don't get it..,"I tried, i really, really tried... I just don't get it! Why is everyone so in love with this series and its' characters? A love story? Edward Cullen is rude, controlling, mean at times... this is the best example of ""boyfriend"" material we can come up with for teenage girls?"
1,Extremely poor writing,"I counted six types of grammar errors just in the first chapter. When poor grammar is so pervasive that it distracts from the plot and characters, I have a difficult time continuing to read. I will finish the book because I want to keep up with what my kids are reading, not because the book is enticing to me in any way."
1,Mindless drivel,I am flabberghasted that this book wasn't snatched up by Mills and Boon. This book is the tortuous result of a Mormon housewife's erotic dream.
2,Agonizing,"The main reason I was able to finish this book was because I had to read it for a young adult novels class I took in college. The narrator, Bella, drove me crazy! The way she gushes, goes weak in the knees, and obsesses over Edward almost made me nauseous. The writing is average at best, and the overplayed drama sometimes made me want to throw the book across the room. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because she tried a new spin on vampires, albeit a weak one. I cannot believe the fascination with this book, although I can see how a thirteen-year-old girl might find this entertaining. If you're not a thirteen-year-old girl, don't bother."
4,I like this book.,"For what the book is I like it. Who said that you can't write a book that leaves everything to the imagination of the reader? So, it doesn't use huge words that half the population doesn't know, who cares? It's not the thickest of plots; however, simple doesn't always mean bad. I recommend this book to people who aren't English majors and that get easily involved in stories that they could picture themselves in; definitely for day dreamers. It wasn't meant to be an end all be all novel. It serves great purpose for sparking the imaginations of its readers. I was easily lost in my own exploration of the characters and making them out to how I wanted them to be. I think Stephenie Meyer did a great job for it being her first self written book."
4,No stop reading,"Wow!, I began to read this book one Sunday, at 11:30am. I finish it at Monday, 03:30am.This book have force, magnetism, it will tightened you.Some people have compared it to the Harry Potter Series, but they are completely differents. HP books 1, 2 & 3 are child books. Book 4,5,6 & 7 are more like to adults books than to the child books people thinks they are. Otherwise, Twiligth is an adolescent book, and it distil this spirit in every page you read. Twilight is a inmense fire. Burn yourself."
2,Sadly disappointed,This book really upset me because I have a 14 year old daughter and I would never want her to be like Bella. She is so dependent on Edward. If he isn't at school she is depressed. She is willing to go out with him even though he might harm her. She would be willing to do anything just to be with him. I think too many teenage girls have this attitude and it gets them into trouble. I rather have my daughter read books with a heroine she can look up to.
1,Horrible Reading!,The book is amazing but the reading of this has very little emotion in the words and doesn't do the book justice
1,Worst Amazon Experience thus far......,I never received this order. When trying to contact the supplier several times I got no response. I have also sent a claim to Amazon directly without a response as well. This has been a bad experience one that will definitely deter me from further purchases through Amazon.
1,Elipse,Since I have yet to receive my book and don't really have an opinion except for the lousy service I have gotten. It has been a month since I ordered the book and I have not seen it. They person I was suppose to get it from said he had been in out of the country and he would mail it that day and that has been 2 weeks ago. I know the mail is slow but come on. If I don't have my book this week I want my money back.
2,Shallow.,"Although this book had a very good main plot, it was not very thought-out and it became confusing at times. The book is also written very poorly, using common words a lot and not including any depth in conversations or descriptions.This book could have been good if it was written by someone else."
1,My point,"First let me tell you I have not read this book and I don't entend to.I am however an avid reader.From experance I can tell you that any story that is 500 pages long has to be full of page filler.Long drawn out conversations,Detailed descriptions of places and Items.No matter how good the main story is you have to wade through all this usless filler to finish it.I have found that any book that is well written is never much longer than 300 pages."
1,This book is crap,See title.Thats all I have to say about vampires who sparkle in the sun and suck on animals when they have nothing better to do.
5,please help me? i don't know if this is too cary or not.,Please send me an email to pine.eniar@gmail.com if u have the answer to my question. I am almost 12 and I'm not sure if I should read Twilight. I liked Hunger Games but is Twilight to scary for me?p.s. the rating is sort of random.
3,Not what I expected,"The book was very easy to read (I did it in 3 days).It was sufficiently entertaining to finish but not enough to seek out the sequels.I bought it because of it's popularity and because I wanted to read a romantic book.About the main characters:EDWARD: I don't really understand why so many girls love Edward so much, he is described as handsome & respectful & so on, but not enough to be obsessed with him.BELLA: She is kind of boring and has no ambitions or hopes for her future (besides Edward), she is obsessed with him!Having said that, I don't think I'll read another book from Meyer."
3,Twilight book one to hard for my 3rd grader.,My third grader wanted this as her 1st book on her Kindle. She is a good reader but this has too many difficult words.
3,Storyline intrigued... the written word annoyed,"With all the hype of this series (and movie) it seemed appropriate to read this book just to see what made it such a phenomenon.It took me only a day to read because it was written so simply, although it is verbose. The storyline itself is so far from reality it was a nice break indeed. I agree with other reviewers on many things including the lack of depth in the characters and constant reminder of the cold, stone-like vampire who was so beautiful.As an adult I can appreciate it as a YA novel, but it seems that it may tell teenage girls everywhere it's ok to be a melodramatic damsel in distress (the only way her hero will be there to save her) as far as I know needing someone that much - and rather die than to be without them -can be a very unhealthy dose of medicine. Keep in mind this is a FANTASY WORLD the author has created.Hopefully the movie captures the intrigue... it will certainly cut out all the wordiness."
3,"Fun, light reading","If you're looking for a deep thought-provoking book, this is NOT the book for you. This book is a fun read. I would call it a ""guilty pleasure"" that I won't brag about reading. I wouldn't allow anyone under 15 to read it since, like other people commented, I don't think the female heroine Bella is a positive role model."
2,In all fairness I am not a teenage girl...,"In all fairness I am not a teenage girl... Reading this book reminds me how grateful I am to have survived that swift and painful passage. The concept of the book , a ""human girl"" falling in love with a ""vampire boy"" was mildly interesting beyond that this book was poorly written and uninspiring. The identical conversation between the two main characters, ""Bella"" and""Edward"" repeated itself over and over throughout the entire book until I found myself wanting to beat my own head against the wall. The concept of 2 selfless teenagers is of course a stretch, add the trite idea of the new girl in town who never wears mascara yet all the local boys fall instantly in love with her to the fascination of the daily life of a teenager described in minute detail over and over and you too will be wanting to beat your head against the wall. Unless of course you are a teenage girl..."
5,Loved Twilight!,"This book was THE book to read this year in the middle school where I work. It was always checked out. There were dozens of holds placed on it and there was always someone asking me whether it was in and was it their turn on the hold list. Romance has never been my genre but throw in vampires and you got me. Curious to see what all the excitement was regarding Twilight I bought myself my own copy and read it. I'm glad I did. I totally enjoyed the story of Bella and Edward. So much so I immediately ordered the next three in the series. This book really captured me and drew me into the world of vampires, romance, and teen love. I didn't think it would appeal to me but I was so wrong. I'm glad I decided to read it."
4,I kind of get the hype,"I read this book not expecting too much. It was just one of those books I thought I should read because of all the hype around it. For the first third of the book my first impressions were justified - it was what you would expect of any pulp fiction. However I must admit I became addicted as the relationship between Bella and Edward progressed and then found it hard to put down. While the writing is ordinary, the plot keeps you enthralled."
1,where is the love?,"This is not a romance or a love story. Plain and simple. He is attracted to the scent of her blood and is driven by his blood-lust of her and she is attracted to him physically. The book doesn't offer us enough reasons as to why they fell in love with eachother. Which if it was true, unadulterated love, they would have fell for eachother's character and inner person. The book doesn't offer enough depth of character for either one of them to actually be in love. They fall ""in love"" too quickly for to be sincere. He stalks her. She is co-dependant of him. Nothing about this story is genuine. I think i have mentioned the word love enough so i am going to stop."
2,What Happened?,I have read all the Twilight books and this was the worst. I don't know what went wrong but I can say the others in the series are so much better. They make up for this one. Is it just me or does Edward seem bi-polar in this book too?
4,Not as Good as Eclipse,"Stephenie Meyers just didn't cut my satisfaction with this book and Edward sounds like a creepy boyfriend to be honest. Bella is a stubborn bitch that takes life too seriously meanwhile keeping a lot of things a secret which sounds dangerous. Jacob's the jerk who tries to control Bella's life and make fun of Edward's lifestyle. Charlie is the lazy dad that should be trying to sound fun or even considerate rather than being the ""Whatever, it's your choice!"". Alice sounds like she's taken too many painkillers. Plus there's not a lot of humour here so I'm definitely sorry to buy this at all."
3,ehh! Nothing new here...,Except for sparkles.This is basically Interview with a Vampire meets Sweet Valley High. My nine year old niece is enjoying it and that's about the right demographic.
5,Good clean romantic fun!,"I loved this book! After seeing the movie and reading this, the first book in the Twilight series, you just have to read the other three. Meanwhile, visit the author's website and the movie website. You may become addicted. It's a good, quick read for any female over 12 and under 100! It's clean with firely romance, but no sex! However, I warn you that you might start getting email from Vampire.com. I think Amazon sold my address to them!"
5,OMG!,"There is a reason why everyone is talking about this book this year. It is so good and after the movie, I totally fell in love with this book more."
5,"Entrancing romance with vampires, werewolves (shape-shifters really), and a normal girl caught in the middle.","A friend described this book and I thought, whatever Im not gonna read a book about high school with a vampire in love with an ordinary girl. But I trusted this friends judgement since she had recommended Harry Potter. Better than I could have ever expected. I've only had the book a couple months and I've read the whole series at least twice, and Twilight about 6x. I even dream in Twilight sometimes. YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK if you love romance and are a girl."
4,amazing book,"I must be frank and say that this is not the best written book ever, because the plot and lines are cliched and very predictable. However, I must also say that this is one of the best books I have ever read, because no other book can be so satisfying to read. Stephenie Meyer has this unique talent of making the readers happy after reading her book."
5,EDWARD!!!!,"I hope the person who forced me to read this book will be eternally blessed, because I have finally found a book that I completely love and can read over and over again! Stephenie Meyer's is a phenomenal writer, and portrays the characters and the world that they live in so skillfully that it makes you feel like they're real. It kinda hurt after finishing the book to wake up to reality and realize there's actually no Edward....sigh. Awesome book!"
3,Vampire romance,I didn't know what to expect with this series so I tried out the first book. For me there wasn't enough of the vampire side of things. If you like a little vampire (not the usual blood sucking ones) and romance this is the book for you.
5,Best Book Ever!,"I love this book so much! Twilight is described as a love story with a bite. I really belive that these books have magic in them. If you're the kind of person who judges a book by it's cover, I know your wrong about this if you say ""no way"" because you think it's all about blood and vampires. When I saw it at first I wasn't interested. Next I read it and I was hooked!From the begining, Bella always looked at the human side of Edward, but he thought of himself as a monster. In the book you'll see that the more time they spend together, the more human Edward discovers himself to be.This book has drama and romance, and it's so much like real life some may say it's realistic fiction. If you like those genres, this book is great for you. Next time your at the bookstore, pick up a copy and see all the crazy adventures Bella and Edward get into in their crazy relationship!By Lindsey"
5,The Twilight Series,I givi twilight 5 stars. This book sreies will hook you and trust me you will get lots of rest because the only thing you will want to do is kick back and read. I read all 4 books in two weeks and i will read them again soon. A must have in your libary.
4,"Not the Best YA Out there, But a Definite Guilty Pleasure","I admit it. Twilight is a guilty pleasure of mine.Despite all the terrible things about it, I enjoy it.Bella is over-dependent of Edward, yes.Edward stalks (come on girls, it's true) Bella, yes.Edward is WAY possessive of Bella, yesBella's parents give her WAY too much freedom, yes.Most of the characters are stereotype cut-outs, yes.Still, I can't help it. Some of the dialogue makes me laugh out loud. Some of the romantic scenes make me hold my breath. And I just adore most of the other Cullens.As far as literature goes, there are much better YA love stories out there.Also... I forgot how terrible the book to movie conversion was until re-reading it; MAN Catherine Hardwick did a TERRIBLE job!"
1,What is Stephanie Meyer thinking ???,I'd really love to know what a mother of small children is thinking when she's writing a 3-part story that glorifies a predatory relationship. Was she thinking at all? I honestly believe it's hard for parents to put this story into perspective for young girls so that they DON'T fall into controlling relationships. Far from helping the conversation we have with our kids Meyer has romanticized predation beyond all measure and with no real consequences since Bella bounces back quickly from any setback and right back into the arms of her predator. We need far better young reader fiction than this nonsense.
2,Question for the lovers of the Twilight series,"Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)I really like the way Stephenie Meyer's writes. It is fun. However, (maybe I am too much of a realist) if the vampires have been around for a long time, why are they just now taking high school classes?"
3,Ok but not great,"Okay, it;s been more than a year since I read this book and I thought it was going to be the most amazing novel ever.I found the characters to be less then interesting and the views of Bella Swan to be very plain.I would have liked to see a lot more character IN Bella not a shadow of her.On a good point though, it was nice to read an easier book and the story itself was interesting (could have been executed better IMHO) but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever read.So to every one who bashes it, it's just a novel and just another sign of the decay going on in the youth today; and to everyone who worships this book, get a life and read something that has more vocabulary and a better executed plot.Read it once, never going to again. It's probably less painful to see the movie.Also! The series gets worse as it goes along."
4,"Really liked it, but...",I got a little bored in parts. Some of the descriptions seemed to drag on and on.
1,Sorry for the girls who could not find anything better to read.,"I heard from my niece that it was the ""best book ever"", read about the author's love for Orson Card and Jane Austen (I love their books), so I got this book from the library and did my best to read it (waste of precious time and effort). There are so many great books to read, why pick up this vapid one? Disturbing and disgusting. Is it marketing or fashion? Does the author really like Orson Card and Jane Austen? It is an insult to them both to even be mentioned in connection with this book."
1,Not what I expected...,"I was very surprised and disappointed by this book. It has so much ""good hype"" flying around that I thought I would enjoy it. Completely the opposite.The morals of the characters are non-exisistant. I can't believe it's touted as LDS fiction and sold in LDS (Deseret Book) bookstores. Not to mention that it is slow, boring, completely predictable, silly and down-right stupid. I barely made it 1/4 of the way through. I don't want my daughter's reading this when they are teenagers."
2,This book reminds me of a naive 13 year old's fantasy of a real romance,"I gave this book a 2 instead of a 1 simply because I did enjoy the author's own twist on the vampire myth. That to me was interesting and refreshing. However, the story in general was a bit to ""mary sue"" for my taste. The main character, Bella is entirely too typical a heroine: she is clutsy and always in need of rescuing, beautiful but doesn't realize it... even though every guy in school decides to ask her out to a girl's choice dance... *roll of eyes*, and the dramatics when she is with Edward grew more and more on my nerves as the book went on. I don't see how it is possible to have a real relationship with a guy who has such power over her that she faints when he kisses her.This book reminds me of a naive 13 year old's fantasy of a real romance. And I was also not impressed with the amount of typos and grammatical errors I came across while reading."
4,For my daughter,The book was in great shape. I bought it for my daughter and she just loved it. Thank you so much.
3,Said It Was New...,"I thought I was buying a new book, but it had clearly been used before. The spine was broken. But, for the price I got it, it was worth it. Just don't label it as new when it isn't. I'm still glad I got it though!"
2,Really?,"SO Twilight the movie comes out, it sucks. New Moon comes out, that sucks too. Eclipse, Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2, they all suck. However, when I say this people are quick to shout that the books are better than the movies. I unlike most, had seen the movies after I read the books, and the books, now that I have read it over within the last four years, are surprising not that much better than the movies. Bella is equally annoying in the books. And sadly I didn't notice until I read it over. She is so codependent upon Edward that you forget she had a life of her own without him. She is compulsive and seems like she has no way of controlling herself, which is probably another reason why I stopped liking her. She is just not the type of person I once envisioned her to be when I read the book back in 08'."
2,hard to finish,"This book was really poorly written and hard to finish. I don't understand all the hype. For a much better book, with werewolves, but without vampires, I recommend Wuthering Heights and a Werewolf. It takes the classic Wuthering Heights love story and adds werewolves, and makes for a much better and much more entertaining read than Twilight."
4,Not bad at all,"I'm a middle-aged man, so this book was definitely NOT targeted to me. Regardless, it is well-written and the plot is engaging."
5,Amazing!!,Good book it is amazing to read and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through.
5,Best book EVER!!!,This is undoubtedly the best book I've ever read in my life. Stephenie is the best she never ceases to disappoint. Twilight Forever!!!
3,The movie is sooo much better!,"I thought the book was okay,,,just okay. This is the first time where the movie out shines the book, that's a first for me. The entire book is written fromBella's POV. Jacob's character did not enter until the middle of the book...and the closeness Jacob and Bella shared(as friends) in the movie was missing in book I."
1,Really?,"Okay, this book can go on my list as the WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. It's poorly written, the characters aren't well formed, and it's WHINY! Really, who wants to read some over-dramatic book about a teenage girl who loves VAMPIRES. It's embarassing that humans have evolved so far just to end up with THIS. Keep this book where it belongs, in the trash."
1,Are you kidding me?!,I have nothing to say except this book is a shame to vampires and werewolves everywhere.
4,"Don't see the film, you should read the book","Much better than the film, Twilight saga is a really good book. If you don't like fantasy, vampires, werewolves and such things; you should not read this book. If you don't like love romance, ""Romeo and Juliet"", and etc; you should not read this book. If you thing that's a horror theme, it isn't! Just enjoy, what it really is ..."
3,3 and a half stars,"A couple of years ago I notice a strange epidemic occured in my high school during the first days of my freshmen year. More and more girls at my school were reading this book and I thought ""maybe just maybe I should read this since everybody loves it."" Got the book and for me it was a page turner, probably because Twilight target audience are teenage girls. But let me tell you, I didn't fall for the ""Oh I wish I had a handsome guy like Edward that is crazy about me' trick like the majority of the readers, I only liked Meyer's storytelling. I didn't pay attention to Edward and his gloomy family that don't act like REAL vampires,you know REAL vampires hate sunlight,suck human blood, etc. Being passive was what made the book a page turning. Even though the book is a little unrealistic, if Bella was in a real high school she would be never be that popular like she was in Forks'.I don't love it but I like it, it's the other books I hated. Especially the last one. .."
5,Excellent love story,"I finally got around to reading the Twilight saga. I previously thought this book was primarily written about teens for teens so I had not gotten on the ""Twilight train"" until a friend mentioned the books and gave them rave reviews. My interest was peaked. I was pleasantly surprised how the story line held my interest with enough action not to be the same old boy meets girl love story. Their story is unique to say the least, but kept me on the edge waiting for the next page. Bella is a true independent, know her own mind kind of girl. Edward is the kind of boy-man wise beyond his stated years. A true must read for anyone who likes adventure with an imaginative twist."
5,Twilight is the best.,"Twilight was an amazing book. After I read Twilight I could not stop thinking about it, even days after I read it. If you buy Twilight I recomend buying New Moon because as soon as you read New Moon you will want to read more of Edward and Bella's story."
3,Just add Thesaurus,"It took me many chapters to get past the horrific writing. I felt like the author had her thesaurus sitting open next to her the entire time she was writing this. So painful to read. But then she hooked me and I couldn't put it down. The writing improves in book 2, hope the trend continues..."
5,a fantastic book,I am reading the book Twilight. I love it. I did not think I would like this book because it involves vampires and I automatically thought it would be a lot of blood and gore but it is a different kind of story.My sister-in-law and my two nieces introduce me to this book and I am glad they did. I cannot wait to read the series of books. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a great story. It is a great read
3,twilight book,"Was not a bad book, just not my style. I didn't feel it had any action until chapter 17. that was for me the only chapter that you felt suspense. It kept repeating the feelings, and stuff like that, but it was ok, seems like a ""teeny bopper"" story for me."
5,Hard to get started and then hard to s top,The story is good. She's not the world's best writter but it's great once you can get past the few hundred pages.
3,Great for young adult readers,"My high school students love this series. It's a basic love story, and a quick entertaining read. I must admit however that I don't understand why grown women are so crazy about Twilight. The relationship featured is that of co-dependent teens in creepy over-protective way.But hey, the kids are reading, so I hope Meyer keeps cranking out the books!"
4,"Good, but can get annoying.","This really is a good book...I promise! However, never has there been a more annoying hero than Bella Swan! To be honest, she is an idiot who only acts on impulse and cares nothing about how her actions effect those around her. Bella, and the fact that you can only read about how beautiful Edward is so many times before you are forced to fight off a stronge urge to vomit are really the book's only two flaws...in my opinion anyway!So, if you like a good read, and monsters, check it out. If you are someone who gets frustrated fast at books then stops reading, you probably won't be able to handle Bella Swan and all her actions without giving up long before you finish."
5,One of my Favorites,"I just finished reading this book. It only took me 2 days, I just couldn't put it down. I have to say this is probably my favorite book. Stephanie Meyer does a fantastic job giving the characters personality. I recently saw the movie, before I read the book. I loved the movie but it doesn't hold a candle to the book. The relationship that edward and bella develope is truly inspiring and based on unconditional love. Edward, although a vampire, is a very kind, decent and loving character. This is an absolute must read. I am going to the book store on my lunch hour to get the second book, I cannot wait to find out what happens."
1,Ugh,"I'm so sad at how poorly I thought this book, this story, was written. Sad because it has become such a pop culture phenomenon, part of a larger phenomenon of vampire-themed shows and movies. That we fetishize shallow, selfish people and unhealthy relationships and reward - idolize even - amateurish writing. I'm sorry to be so harsh about someone who put in so much hard work. At least Stephanie Meyer's hard work has been rewarded, but I am not a fan of the Twilight Series."
3,The book lover for all twihards.,"As an author ofPossessions (The Possessions Saga)I know a little something about the supernatural world. In fact before I started writing my book I spent months researching and changing things into how I saw them. However, I did make sure I kept the important things the same. I know this book has lots of people who love it. I just have never feel in love with it. That is not to say Stephanie Meyer isn't a good writer on the contrary I think she is very talented. This book just wasn't for me but that's okay I loved the movies! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys something different."
5,AMAZING,"I absolutely loved the entire series. I have to admit the first book took me a while to get into, but once halfway through I could not put it down and had to read the next one immediately. The book sucks you in like no other book, you feel like you are in the story and take things very personally. I think the author did a great job and look forward to any more books."
3,My Review,"After reading the first book in the series, I'm not that impressed. Yes, I realize that as a 36-year-old male I am not the target audience for this series, but I like to read a wide variety of genres and wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. The actual storyline and characters are fairly well thought out and developed (I could have done with a lot less teenage angst, but it was not at all unexpected.) My main problem was that I did not find this to be very well written at all. The pacing left little to be desired and the writing style itself I found to be rather dull. I will most probably be blasted for this comparison, but I picked this up likening it to the Harry Potter series in that it was very highly hyped and everyone had to read it. However, Harry Potter is very well written and entertaining, and while I've read much worse, Twilight so far has not impressed. Hopefully the series gets better as I go."
5,A must read series,This is a great 1st book in the Twilight Series. It is very descriptive and easy to read. It's hard to put down. It is a young adult book but it appeals to older people too. If you read it you'll enjoy it.
4,Vampire Review,I saw Twilight the movie b/4 I read the book. I liked them both. I found the book easy to read and I have since ordered the next two books in the series.
5,WOW... these books are soooooo good!,"Since I see that there are over 2,000 reviews on these books i will keep it short. These books are SO good! They will make even the toughest of ladies hopeless romantics. The only downside is that they were intended for teens and I partially disagree with that. I feel that these books should not be read by girls under the age of 16 because even though the characters stay ""innocent"" they sleep in the same bed every night and I don't think that is an idea that I want my 13 year olds head. In all, these are fantastic books for a more mature audience."
5,Great gift idea,I got 2 copies of this book. I gave one to my sister and I kept one for myself. It is really a great gift for any Twilight fan.
2,Disappointed!,"I read this book to see what the big deal was. I am finished, and am still wondering???? There are nearly 500 pages. It took almost 400 pages of reading for anything of significance to happen. The author goes into painstaking detail about every little thing. If all the dribble were edited out, the book probably could have been 150 pages. The characters were not interesting. The story drags. There is very little vampire activity overall.Just not entertaining or enjoyable."
1,Boring Story and No Command of the English Language,"I found this novel very frustrating. The story starts out promisingly enough but it quickly turns into something boring and lame. And, to add insult to injury, it is not even written in English, but in some kind of pseudo-English slang in which the rules of grammar have been tossed out the window. For example, Stephenie Meyer has an irritating habit of using ""who"" instead of ""whom"", even in places where the missing ""m"" is not only grammatically incorrect but also rhythmically jarring, as in the case of ""who I would have hated anyway"". Maybe somebody should give she English lessons so that her could learn the difference between subjects and objects."
1,It's a bloody soap opera!,"The series of which this book is a part reads as a twisted soap opera. The heroine likes cuddling up to a stone hard, un-dead, icy-skinned, but somehow attractive guy that no one, including her father and the population of the town where they live, seems to notice is just a bit unusual. The story probably appeals to pre-teen/early teen girls who are intrigued by the bad boys in their crowd. The author passes on the opportunity to address the several analogous social issues that could give interesting depth to the novel, for instance: to accept (or not) the outcasts among us, moral justification for morally unacceptable acts, or the attraction to danger suffered by many of our young people. This book does not share insight, nor is it of a quality to warrant purchasing it."
4,Interesting Love Story Twist,"Twilight is really a love story, not a novel about vampires. The author mixes the two worlds so effectively, it's hard to distinguish the difference. Instead of distracting the reader from a traditional love saga, the overarching vampire storylines and mysteries adds depth to the intensity shared between the two main characters. Looking forward to reading the other books in this series. Almost gave it five stars."
5,surprise like,I was surprised that i enjoyed this book so much. I am 36 years old and felt like i was a teenager again. I was lost in the mystery of this love story and the fantasy apsect. I could not put it down. Somewhat predictable but i just got lost in the fantasy. A great escape from the real world.
4,Wish I read the info carefully,"When I ordered the product online, I thought I would get the set collection. As I received the item, I was disappointed. I knew that the whole set for the $20 price would be too good to be true. So, I gave it a shot. I read the book and tried to focus on the positive sides: collector's edition, dusk jacket, red ribbon marker. Yet, the price could have benn a little more cheaper. Moral lesson: read the description VERY carefully. If you think you read it twice, then read it again and again."
5,The best book ever,I love this book and anyone who loves romance and fiction should read it. Beautiful story and a constant page turner-edog
3,A grown-ups review of Twilight,"As an adult fan of Harry Potter genre books, I thought I would check out Twilight because I had heard good things about it. For the most part, I enjoyed it because Stephanie Meyer definitely has a way of drawing you into her characters in a compelling way. However, much of her talent was wasted on endless discussion of Edmund's supermodel looks and smoldering topaz eyes - a little too romance novel for my taste. There were a lot of interesting characters introduced and I would have liked to have been able to get into their heads as in depth as Bella's; the first 75% of the book could have been condensed down to the first 30% easily without taking anything away from it. The book was defintely written specifically to adolescent girls, alienating boys and adults that enjoy the Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl style adventures."
1,a waste of time and money,"Had great reviews from friends. Found you either loved it or hated it. I know it is a teen book but I hope teens are reading things better written and more engaging. This is more of a very early, poor reader teen book. Did not like it and have the next 2 waiting to send to a good home."
1,I'm a big fan of vampire fiction...,"...and this book hardly qualifies. I was so excited when it was touted as the new ""Harry Potter"". Ummm...I wonder if the people that said that actually read the book.First off, the plot is rather flimsy. Meyer takes up a good chunk of the book to write an extremely sappy love story between Edward and Bella and throws in some bad vamps in the end to further emphasize how much Edward and Bella love each other. It's more teen romance than it is vampire fiction. There wasn't even a fight scene between the bad vamp and Edward.Additionally, it irks me that Bella is so stupid and helpless. She's also very insensitive and selfish. If this is supposed to be geared towards a younger audience, what type of message is Meyer sending?Ugh, this novel was indeed an easy read since there was absolutely no meat to it. A lot of fluff could've been taken out and the novel still could've worked. Will it have been better? Probably not."
5,The book that speaks my soul,"i have never read a book and lost all track of time and place because, i was so interested. i think everyone should read this book"
2,Could have been done better,"I read the first book, and only the first book. I had heard how horriable it was, and how great it was. I wanted to make an honest opinion for myself.First, Bella is an accurate portrayal of many teenage girls. This is unfortunate, but I can see traits shared by my fifteen year old daughter and some of her friends. Second, I cannot stand the sparkly vampire thing. The author appears to have did very little research on vampire lore. In my opinion if she wanted to make an undead creature sparkle in the sunlight, she should not have called it a vampire.If vampires are your thing, I suggest finding a diffrent book. If teenage drama about girls with low self esteems is your thing, then continue reading."
2,Meh,This book was ok. It was pretty annoying to see Bella so EXTREMELY in love. To that the point where she won't live anymore. But other then that it was okay. I am going to read the next one hopefully she won't be so annoying.
5,This is my Favourite.,Love the romance and anticipation of new and forbidden love. I have read this book 4 times. Sad I know but it is a lovely story and very romantic.
1,Save the trees! Don't buy this book!,"Brainless, brain-dead excrement.The fact that it emphasizes virginity and chasteness in a young adult relationship is laudable. The fact that it portrays stalking as romantic behavior is appalling and the fact that millions of young girls are swooning over this portrayal and hoping for a similar relationship frightens me to the very marrow of my bones."
1,Team Tyler's Van!!!,"Twilight is what I imagine a Nora Roberts novel is like, but without the porn. Which raises the very valid question of, what IS a Nora Roberts novel like without porn? Well, it's like this. 400 pages of... what happens again?"
1,Not for me,"I can see why young and pre-teens would like this book. Too young for my taste. Story not all that interesting. Found it kind of goofy in parts. Kept thinking ""oh come ON!"""
5,Butterflies will explode in your stomach,It's pretty powerful when a writer can get across this type of love to the audience. Butterflies and other feelings will explode with in yourself as you read!
4,Not my type of book but I liked it,"Young Adult romance books are not my cup of tea, but altough I should have known better, I did not know that when I first opened the book. Nevertheless, I was determined to finish the book, and I was pleased with the ending - it was suspenseful, and the relationship between the vampires and werewolves intrigued me to the point where I wanted to read the next part in this tale. As far as the main part of the book, depsite the more than usual amount of suspension of belief that is required in a supernatural romance - it does work, and well-written enough for a non fan to like the book enough to read the next chapter."
3,Twilight,Twilight is a great sappy love story. It is scarry but safe. I like the fact there is no sex & little violence. It is a fun & entertaining read.
5,A MUST READ BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is beyond perfect!!!! i am a book worm and i have read a lot of books, but this is my absolute favorite besides Eragon and Eldest and the Harry Potter series. i have never read vampire books before, but this book was absolutely perfect. i read it and its sequel within about 3 days!!!!! and i have already reread them 2 times each. i recommend this book to all people of all ages 13 and above!!!! anyone who breathes must READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!it is about a 17 year old girl that moves to her dad's house in Forks, there she meets a mysterious Edward. she falls unconditionally in love with him despite his big secret!!!!"
5,The Greatest Book Series ever!!,This book is amazing!!! I love the chemistry between Bella and Edward for they are just too intense. Once you are done reading this book it leaves you wanting more and lucky for us there are 3 more books after this!! I would have to place this book up in my top five :) Buy this Book for you will not be sorry that you did.
5,FANTASY VS REALITY,SINCE WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS VAMPIRES I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY NOT ALL YOUNG READERS ARE PINING OVER THEM...GIVE ME A BREAK THE BOOK IS ENTERTAINING AND IT IS AFTER ALL FICTION GET OVER ALL OF THE WHAT MESSAGE DOES IT SEND ITS ABOUT VAMPIRES AARRGGHHH!!!!
3,Not quite sure it sparkles,"There was this huge buzz in one of the bookstore I visited in Australia, about this book, so I picked it up. I generally like reading vampire-fiction, so this was right up my alley. The salesperson at the check-out even told me that this was a very good book.I read it in one sitting. Afterwards my immediate thoughts were that this book was a bit simplistic/shallow and shamelessly aimed at teenagers.It's mainly a teenage romance with sparkling vampires, with an okay enough plot.Maybe I expected a bit more from the book, since it was recommended by the bookstore AND the adult clerk, but alas it wasn't to be. As a twenty-something avid reader, I found myself slightly too mature for the book, and had seriously difficulties relating to the main characters.I will try the next one to see if the series improve.Recommended for teenagers, and people with teenager-brains."
3,Needs less sap and more action,"I liked parts of the book and the overall storyline has potential. Some of the characters are interesting (the vampire family and Jacob), but the 2 main characters are boring. There are pages and pages of their emotional ""turmoil"" repeating throughout the book.The action bits were good and with more action and less of the sappy ""he loves me / he loves me not"" this book could've been great."
3,Just not in a class with Harry and the gang,"Like Host, I purchased this audio book to see what it was about for my grandchildren (big Harry Potter fans) I read an article about the author and her work in Time and also she was on the Glen Beck show. The book was enjoyable, but Rowling need not worry. It just didn't captivate me like Harry's story did. It struck me as romance-light. In spite of the vampire theme, Anne Rice can rest easy too.i"
3,Could have been better,"I do not like Stephenie Meyer's writing. She elaborates on far too many unimportant details and strings you along the whole book waiting for something good to happen. I love romance novels and movies. I HATE the fact that she made EDWARD SO COLD!!! I understand he is a vampire but when I think passion, love, and excitement I think HEAT! I never ever got the true feeling of their love for one another as everytime they kiss or get close it is passionless, and icy cold!! No spark! No heat! I don't care if he is a vampire, sometimes something cold can also be hot. The idea is not put across well as everytime they embrace, I don't feel the love or the spark. The book was ok for me, the movie looks much better. The next book is horrible torture (read the reviews). I am unsure about the series. If it wasn't for the fact I had it on my ipod and didn't have to physicall sit and read it, I'd say skip it."
4,"Best book I've read in a long, long time.","I was extremely hesitant to read this, since I'm 21 and thought it was a teenage thing, but my friends literally dragged me to the bookstore, and I read the whole book in a few hours. Yes, there is a werewolf and vampire love triangle. Sounds kind-of farfetched, I'll agree. Yes, Bella is whiny and sometimes nauseatingly infatuated with Edward. All in all though, kudos to Stephenie Meyer for getting me to read again! This is the best book of the three. Can't wait for August 2nd."
1,Horrible and disappointing,"This has to be the worst book I have ever read. I picked it up because so many people were raving about it. Now I see that it is nothing more then a mary-sue fanfiction published to make emo, sexually repressed, immature girls orgasm. It really is nothing more then this authors wet dream gone wild. If you are a parent looking for a good book for your child this is not it. If you are someone looking for a bit of light reading, this is not it. If you are someone wanting to read a book with amazing characters, good story line, and an awesome twist!!!!...this is not it. This book is to juvenal for adults and to adult for the target reading group. If I could, I would have geven this book zero stars.I returned the book"
1,Eh - not worthy of the attention it's received,"My daughter recommended this book and I did read it. It seems ridiculous to me that this book is so popular. I ended up skipping all the staring, glaring, growling and generally unimaginative text, as it became repetitive and dull. I found neither character to be likeable or sympathetic and kept hoping Bella would get eaten. There might have been some interesting moments, for instance when Edward told how he became a vampire. I wished there was more about that part, but vampires seem to conveniently forget their human past. Also, I couldn't figure out how Bella could love a cold dead ""thing"" and why Edward loved Bella, a selfish, vapid, dull teenager 90 years or so younger than himself except that to him she smelled like a pork chop."
2,Not for Adult Readers,"I want to start this review by saying my neice loves this book.I often enjoy YA fiction myself so I picked up a copy to read. It was dreadful and I enjoyed Harry Potter.The plot drags on forever without anything happening.The color of his eyes are repeated so many times I want poke out my own.I got tired of reading 'he said, she said, she mumbled'. Does the writer have to tell who says every moment of dialogue?What saves the book is that it has a certain wistfulness in the characters that appeals to the teen set.The movie doesn't hurt either.However, for a book lover or a writer, this book is just a stinker.I think with some re-writing and some vamping up of the plot, it could have been great for readers of all ages. Right now, I can't imagine anyone over 19 dragging themselves through the boredom of reading it.It's okay but not spectacular."
1,This got published?,Let's say that you can ignore the rampant sexism in this book. That you can further ignore Meyer writing in all the Mormon crackpottery officially condemned by the church. That you can let slide the painfully childish plot and unlikeable main characters. There still remains one simple fact: this is one of the most painfully badly-written pieces of published writing I have ever had the misfortune of coming across.I've scored 9th-grade essays that tortured the English language significantly less. Her editor should be shot; maybe then he'd do a better job.It makes me shudder to think about what the manuscripts must have looked like before editing. I can only conclude that Meyer has the IQ of a leek.
2,Combined review - daughters...,"I just thought I'd summarize my daughters' reviews of this series for other Dad's out there. Having not read the book, I'll just submit their comments which I just heard recently when they told me the movie was coming out as this is apparently a popular book series.In a nutshell, my 15 year old thought the main girl character was ""stupid"" and ""useless"". She thought the story was ""OK"". On the other hand she hopes the movie is good and will see it because her friends will, and she would like to at least participate in coversations about the movie.My 13 year old thought the books were slightly better then just OK, but also thought the lead girl was ""stupid"" and ""weak"". She liked the movie well enough, but thought the girl, again, had nothing to say.Hey, I'm a guy and father and I'll never see the movie or read the books, so I'm just passing on my kids' reviews."
5,Oh you will get hooked!!!,"This is going to be the next big book. Watch in a week it will become number one on the list it will be a new york times best seller and it is the best surpirse hit in years. When i went to go get the book at my local book store they were all out, becuase they didn't order enough and said they had a huge shipment coming in. They said they had no idea it would be this huge. I then had to order it online at amazon.com. Anyways, this novel is an extraorinary one and i will never forget it now that i have read it. The detail of expresions on the different character's faces, their reations, and their mood changes are some of the best i have ever seen. Stephenie Meyer has created a novel that will have a place in my heart, forever."
1,Blah!,"Blah! One of the worst things I've ever read. Vampires should not sparkle! Fluffy and trite. Sad that this will be the way most young people will be introduced to vampire literature. They will think that this is the norm, while ignoring true great vampire novels like ""Interview With The Vampire,"" ""Depraved Blood: The Young Blood Suckers Series"" and Poppy Z Brite's ""Lost Souls."" I do enjoy the shirtless wolf boy in the movies :)"
5,Wonderful Book,"My sister got me hooked on the book. I think its absolutely breath taking. When I start a book I have to finish it. I loved this book so much that I actually stopped in a parking lot to finish a chapter...lol. I know there is a mention of sex in book but honestly it was addressed in a good way. They restrain from physical ""activities."" A lot of teenagers would have a hard time with that. Although in my mind there is a little action going on (my sister agrees). We hope Edward and Bella do marry and Bella becomes a vampire. If that happened before the end of the series that would be awesome. I recommend it to anyone to read especially high school aged children."
2,Not for me.,"Just couldn't get into the book, I know I'm about the only one but it just didn't click for me. All the hype but a no go."
3,"Interesting, but...","Was lured by all the media hype on this series, and movies etc. Little too much teen-age angst for me, but reasonably well written. Definitely not for senior citizens."
3,Better than I thought it would be,"Ok, this isn't Hamlet. I read it because my daughter loved it (I needed some excuse). It was better than I anticipated, probably because the movie was so horrid. I actually thought Meyer's 'adult' novel ""The Host"" was pretty good (except for a few pretty lame parts). What we read for love!"
5,great book,I really enjoyed this book. Creative and funny. This was the first book I read by this author and I have now read all the books in the series. It is not an explicit book but has a great plot and an endearing love story with it. You'll fall in love with the characters.
5,Awesome!,"This book is a must read, even if you aren't crazy about vampires. It is a beautiful story about love and the struggles that can come with it. When a vampire and a human being fall in love, forbidden love."
1,AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!,"Bella Swan- airhead girl with a creepy obsession with someone she doesntt know.edward- stalker vampire with ""a perfectly carved marble chest"", ""beautiful topaz eyes"" (get used to it, its repeated so much it hurts)bellas parents- what happened t their parenting skills? im no parent, but do they have any sense? hes singing her to sleep in her bed!!!!jacob- has an awkward exchange with edward in book 2. emphasis on awkward.yeah the whole book is basically OMG!!! HES SO HAWT!!!! but in a way a 40 year old woman says it."
1,IF CONSIDERING READING...,"i loved twilight and the next two books...but i wish someone would have given me this advice before i decided to read them:READ THE REVIEWS FOR BREAKING DAWN before deciding (watch for spoilers though!). i am so incredibly disappointed after reading breaking dawn, as so many others are. go in knowing its a possibility you may hate the 4th book and so...sigh...all the others too."
4,"Friendship, trust, and self-control...","I recently had the pleasure of reading Stephenie Meyer's TWILIGHT, a story among other things of friendship, trust and self-control.This tale is not your typical vampire love-story. This story is a story about a young teenage girl, Bella, coming of age, getting to know herself while learning to trust in others: especially that of her high school crush...who happens to be a vampire.The interesting thing about this story is that the vampire, Edward, also has a crush on her. And he too, must come to understand his feelings while practicing self control, else she becomes his prey. What I do love is Meyer's play in symbolism in the sense that what would be in most books a potential sex scene becomes that of a potential ""sucking of the blood"" scene.A wonderful story and I look forward to reading the rest of the series.J.R. Reardonauthor of ADVICE AND CONSENT"
4,entertaining,"As a general fan of vampire fiction, I immediately enjoyed Meyer's take on the more relatable ""vegetarian"" vampires. I am fond of each of her characters and respond to Bella's point of view.At first, Bella is a believable character, but she gradually she becomes more untouchable as the series continues in later books.Edward is easy to fall in love with and Alice is an ideal best friend.The inner struggles of the characters brings a level of sincerity and seriousness to the novel that, perhaps, the young-adult reading level does not.It's a delightful read that has many comparisons to Romeo and Juliet without the implicit tragedy. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good love story mixed with sci/fi and suspense."
5,best book ever,twilight is the best book ever!! i couldn't stop reading it!!i soo need to read new moon...cant wait till my mom gets it for me!!!!
1,Dear GOD NO! No cookies for you!,Seriously? People seriously think these books are good?THE VAMPIRES SPARKLE. In the sunlight. SPARKLE.LIKE THEIR SKIN IS COVERED WITH DIAMONDS.That alone should make everyone throw these books on the fire. SPARKLING? ARE YOU SERIOUS WOMAN?How could anyone think these books are good?
5,Romance and Adventures all in one.,"Not being a huge vampire fan... I thought this book wasnt for me. After picking it up and setting it down five times, i decided to give it a try. I am surley glad i did! Filled with adventures, danger, and romance this books main character Bella, is what all teens dream of being. This romance will keep you reading untill the very end. I read this book in one sitting and when i finished it, i flipped in back over and read it again! This novel sets way for a series that makes you thirsty for more! BRAVO!"
3,Twilight,"If I could give it 2 1/2 stars I would. This book, while it has an intresting story line becomes a medicore book later on. The part when Edward and Bella are getting to know each other is intresting but the ""action"" part isn't. I didn't like that part at all, it was like it transformed into a different book. I would say that Bella is your typical person in these books. Meaning, not too bright. The only reason Edward likes Bella, got an intrest in her is because he cannot read her mind. Seems weird to base a romance on that.So, overall it's a good read but not something that goes on my favorites shelf or something to reread and read over and over. Try it, see if you like it but be warned you might not. Not everybody likes this book although it seems like a lot do."
3,GREAT FOR TEENAGERS,"This is a great,real fast read for fantasy loving advanced year teenagers. Some adults may also like it as well."
5,awesome,I woud give 17 billion stars if i had the option.I can not wait to read the other twighlight books; D
1,Terrible,"This book is absolutely abhorred. The characters have no personality, the book has no plot, and it is so riddled with plot holes that it reads like swiss cheese.I will never read this book again, nor recommend it to anyone."
1,Blah,Some of the worst writing I have read. I threw the book across the room after 100 pages. The writing is that bad. I did finish it but regret it.
1,Pathetic female lead!,"I have read all of the books, not just the first one, and I have to say once you look back at what really happens throughout the entire story you realize how pathetic the main character is and how poorly written the lead male character is. It was obvious that the author is Mormon besides the fact that she went to Brigham Young University. By the time they get to the last book, the girl is 19, she gets married and has a baby, and she will be eternally happy with the love of her life. Is this really what you want to teach your daughters to look to for what create happiness, marrying a guy right out of high school and having a child? Oh, but the male character has so much money that she will still be able to go to collage. Not likely."
2,adult review,"Twilight is 300 pages of foreplay, and 100 pages of vampire chase mystery. Meyers is very good at writing about sexual tension, and there is no objectionable sexual content (for young readers) because they never get past first base. Bella is a hero because she is willing to make sacrifices to save those she loves. Unfortunately, her view of love is not as mature. This is more of a problem in book 2 than book 1, where infatuation is still the theme, rather than the sharing of common interests which should be the basis of commitment. It's a good, simple, read. It is enjoyable fiction. I wish Meyer had more to teach about infatuation vs love."
5,Loved these books!!,"After a week of complete obsession with the Twilight saga, (I haven't been able to stop reading these books until I finished them)I wanted to see what reviews these books were getting. I was surprised at some of the negative reviews that it received. I thought some points should be clarified:These books are a ROMANTIC THRILLER. The vampires are DIFFERENT from some that you have seen in movies or read in other books. This is a work of fiction from a dream that the author had on the characters.I think these books are captivating, surprising and have been so much fun for me to read. I have LOVED them! I can't wait to see the movie!"
5,It only gets better.,"You definitely have to read this one first. Once you have let me know if you agree with the casting of the movie. My guess is NOT. Edward is downright ugly, and the wigs and dye jobs .... I scoff and vomit simultaneously. But the book is great. I dare you NOT to get hooked. It only gets better."
5,One of the Best I have ever read,"This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I found it to be entertaining on top of well written. I was hooked almost from the get go. I did have a problem with the instant love that happened between Edward and Bella. I thought that it was a bit rushed. The plot was a little thin in some areas, but it was hardly noticable. There was also a little too much in depth conversation and high school chit chat but this is a Young Adult book so I guess I have to take it for what it is.I found the characters to be well developed and decribed. The good thing about the book is that all the other supporting characters had good descriptions as well.This was a fantastic book I recommend it to people of every age."
1,I wish someone would've told me...,"That this is primarily a romance novel for young women more than anything else. Sure, there's vampires, but they're not the main focus of the book; the ""doomed"" relationship is. I read the book on a recommendation from a female friend thinking it was mainly a vampire book. I wish she would've told me it wasn't. Guys, do not read this book. It will take me weeks to recover the testerone lost."
5,Leaves you thirsting for more...,"Ever thirsting for something, something that you can't get enough of as if it's the adrenaline that's pumping your blood at this very moment? Well then this book is what you should be reading. Not only does it have a twist of fantasy and an entire world of wonder but also romance that makes you want some more. It's not made just for vampire fans but also those who are basically like myself, a hopeless romantic. You become so entangled in the awkward but timeless romance of Edward and Bella that you would forget that you're reading a book. Stephenie Meyer did a fantastic job on this book and I do hope that everyone out there who isn't quite fond of reading books will pick up this one and give it a try. And I'll guarantee you that you won't put it down till the last page. And even then you would thirst for more blood... I mean thirst for more of Edward's and Bella's twisted fate."
2,A simple and overrated book.,"I was skeptical about reading Twilight because of all of they hype, but the book itself was an easy read. It was interesting, yes. However, Bella is a poorly developed protagonist, with what I felt was somewhat of an odd personality change towards the end of the novel, not caused by any of the events leading up to it.Edward and the Cullens family, however, are interesting characters, with much more depth than Bella, but as they are not the characters who's point of view is being used, the book was a bit frusterating.As I said before, the book was an easy read, but this could've been because of the way the plot seemed to be rushed.All in all, the topic of vampires has been done to death, and there is no reason that this book is considered so great in comparison."
5,On of the best books out today,"this book is amazing...you need to read it! i saw it in ""Teen People"" and it said it was a ""good"" read. After reading the first chapter i knew that those critics had no idea what they were saying...the book keeps you entertained from beginging to end!! The vampire theme is always a hard idea to keep interesting with out going into a sterotypical idea, and Meyer really does an amazing job of her own ""world"" of vampires!! I can't wait until her sequal New Moon comes out!!"
5,Loved it!!,"I absolutely loved this book...I bought it without even reading it first, just based on reviews, and then turned around and read it, in 2 days, and bought the next two books that night!! I can't wait for the 4th one!!"
5,TWILIGHT SAGA,"This book was PHENOMINAL!!! I am eagerly awaiting the final installment in the series! This is a stick your nose in the pages and stay there until you are done book!!! Gripping anc captivating, clean and an enjoyable read! Stephenie Meyer has got a gift!!!! SOOOOO worth the money you pay for the book!!! Kept me reading with baited breath each page I turned! Full of suspense and intrigue! A MUST read!!!"
5,"May be written for teens, but definitely appealing to adults","The last time I read a young adult book, I didn't have a driver's license. I was tempted to pass Twilight by based on its YA classification. However, I read a few positive reviews and thought I would give the series a try. I am glad I did. This book perfectly captures the feelings of a high school student. Where do you sit at lunch? How do you communicate with your parents? Why do you blush every time your crush glances your way? Stephenie Meyer nails all of these emotions and then compounds them with the added drama of falling for a vampire. I loved this book and it is definitely on my ""keeper"" shelf."
2,Book 1 is more than enough,"Too sappy & sensual - leave out the middle 200 pages and my criticism might be lessened. Shallow character development to the point that I had to press through the boredom. (Adolescent literature doesn't have to be shallow to be at the targeted reading level.) Of all the wonderful pieces of literature out there - classics, and modern - I can't help but feel sad that young ladies across the world (observed first-hand at my middle school) are so enamored by a story with such repetition in word usage, such an inconsequential story line, and such unnecessary sensuality. Somehow, I get the feeling that Meyers is capable of better than this."
2,Ack. . .,"I wanted to know what all the hype was about . . . the idea of Vampire Romance intrigues me, but this is so much Romance that the Vampire becomes an after-thought. Yes, Edward is perfect and Bella is smitten, but we can have a little adventure here, can't we? About page 350 the adventure heats up - excitement! A rival, evil vampire! And then Bella gets knocked out of the action so we don't even get to see the climactic battle. Fine for romance novel lovers who are too timid for the vampire/fantasy genre, but if you like vampires and werewolves, I'd suggest Patricia Briggs instead. . . or the TV series ""Moonlight."""
1,"Millenium Snow revisited, but badly","Check out the manga ""Millenium Snow"" written by Bisco Hatori. You might notice some similarities to ""Twilight"".Similarities such as; the heroine has both a vampire and a werewolf after her, the vampire saves her life near the beginning of the story, and the vampire sparkles like diamonds. The plot premise is pretty much the same. The heroine ends up choosing the vampire over the werewolf, maybe because this vampire is also choosy about his diet.One way in which the books are different is that ""Millenium Snow"" was published much earlier than ""Twilight"". Is it possible Ms. Meyer's now-famous dream of vampires in a shojo-sparkle infested meadow was inspired by a japanese graphic novel? Nah."
1,Flat,"This book is flat. Flat boring!There is nothing wrong with a simple teen romance plot (and it is a very simple plot) if the author has the characters to support it. Twilight does not. The characters are one dimensional and sexist. Appearently Meyer's believes that if the Herion (who is 15!) doesn't inspire lust in every male creature she encounters then she's not interesting enough to be the lead. Also, that all males who are not beautiful ""like diamonds"" than its ok to treat them like lesser beings and those who are beautiful should be forgiven of all sins. Same for the girls. All characters seem very vain and shallow, but mostly boring.I have read a lot of books and can honestly say this one is the worst I have ever read."
4,"A great book, except if you are full of yourself.","I loved this book.Plain and simple.I am not a book critic, I am not a professional writer, I am just a regular everyday person.I am also not a teenage girl.Either way, the book was entertaining.I love how there are essay long reviews from people who hated the book.Really if you hated it that much WHY are you wasting your freakin time writing an essay about it?I love it how these people ramble on and on about the grammar mistakes, the lack of depth of the characters, the horrible plot ect...Especially since I dont see any of them reference any of the novels they have written.So dont let a bad review stop you from reading this book.Its just a book, I mean if you want to read a classic why the hell would you read a vampire book to begin with?I found that I really liked it, its good to escape from the real world every once in a while.You never know until you try."
5,Twilight Book 1,"My copy took a little longer to get here than I was expecting, but over all the book is in great condition with very little ware and tare, I will definitely buy from them again."
4,I was surprised,"Bought the book on a dare, expecting to toss it after a couple chapters. But liked it so much I bought and read the whole series. Interesting how the young people's genre is developing. I am finding books that are earmarked for young adults to be among my favorites these days. Loved the whole concept of ""vegetarian"" vampires."
4,mild fun,"I enjoyed this light romance cloaked in a dark shadow. Basically your average teen romance story but with a vampire as the ""bad boy"" and I h=guess that's not a spoiler since the whole world already knows it! I'd read more in the series but not in a big hurry."
1,"in real life, guys who sparkle are GAY","wow. so some loser girl who has no emotion falls for this sparkley vampire. what? i read this book because it was the fad... and at first i enjoyed it. but as i kept reading i realized this book is written to make you feel like you are bella. you fall inlove with edward in book one,as bella, and lose him in book two,as bella. you get saved by him in book three,as bella. and in book four you get knocked up by edward as bella. sounds fun? not. so bella is like a pair of pants. when you read the book, you put the bella pants on. get it? its pretty funny accually. but if you want to read a book that is both fiction and amazing, read the hunger games trilogy! so, i normally give very nice reviews, but this book is just bad, plus what kind of straight guy sparkles?"
1,Don`t read this.,Ok. I could not get through the first twemty pages. it was boring and dumb. i dont reccoment thi to anyone.
5,Phenomenal book,I truly enjoyed this entire series. The characters simply jump out of the pages. A well-written and wonderfully entertaining love story that rivals Romeo and Juliet. I look forward to reading many more of Stephenie Meyer's books.
2,Did not meet expectations...,"The book came on time, however I ordered the book ""new"" not ""new-ish"" the book had a bent edge, part of the paper on protective cover was coming off, and was not wrapped in the original package. I ordered New Moon through a different company and the book not only arrived on time, but was in the original packaging. I will not use this company again."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,"Stephenie Meyer is probably one of the most creative writers I have ever read. Her interpretation of vampires is so much better than the Hollywood versions that have fangs and can not come out except for at night. The story line may seem immature, as it takes place in high school - but I assure you, this is not the case. Twilight can be read, and should be read, by people of all ages. I can't imagine another book that has made me enjoy reading as much as the Twilight Series."
2,It's Really Not That Great,"If you are looking for a fast, easy read this book would be the one you are looking for.However, if you go back to reread it and try to get anything out of it, you won't find much, just shallow characters and no plot whatsoever. Just a whole lot of pretty sparkly vampires (Since when did they sparkle?) who angst a lot, and a shallow self-obsessed teenager who angsts even more, and a relationship that is based solely on physical characteristics, which is not what true love is about.It makes a good beach read, but it's nothing more than that."

2,Kid stuff!,"This is great reading for the ditzy, hormone driven teenage girl group. Call it romance or whatever, it is just drivel!"
1,Strange,"So I see how everyone can love this book. I mean there's just so much going on, and it keeps you reading. I wanted to see what the big deal was so I read it. So as a Christian I was trying to see this book by others prospective and It was not happening. why would someone want to be in love with something so dark and evil? Why would she torture herself like that. Their love isn't even real. It's all sexual. They don't even have things in common. Why would you choose to live in a world like this. I know that this is the time where evil will look good, and good will look evil but yuck. People wrap themselves and get so deep into something that can take you to another place. Oh i almost forgot about the beginning of the book. The dedication caught my eye. Especially if you think about it. hhhmm......."
3,Could be better...,"I am assuming you already know about the plotso I won`t sumarize it. This book is good, not one of my favorites, and it could definetly be written better. The plot and storyline was execlent and I got some unexpected action. Was I the only one who was surpised by the amount of life-or-death situations?The writing is not that great. Meyer makes a lot of contadicitions in her work. The characters were unlikable. Bella is selfish, vain, petty, and kind of whitchey. Edward is kind of dumb, and he falls for Bella after hearing that she moved to Forks to let her mother travel with her stepfather.Overall it is a good book (good plot, action, pacing) with some flaws (bad writing, characters). Don't get me wrong, I really liked it, I'm on Team Edward and I watch the movies. But it would be a GREAT book if the writing and characters were better."
1,Are you kidding?,"This is probably the biggest waste of time I have spent in my life, made only less fulfilling after spending even a breath on this rubbish. There are no redeeming qualities in this book, other than that the pseudo-author, I can't force myself to type ""writer,"" somehow stumbled blindly into something that a certain segment of the population wanted. I guess it was heavy unconsumated teenage panting with vampires. The settings are not well described, nor are the characters filled out. But, primarily, the writing is crude at best, childish primarily. As any vampire would say, ""this sucks."""
1,"Loved the book, but Breaking Dawn Killed the whole thing",i loved this book and for me it should have ended here. SM killed the series with Breaking Dawn.
5,amazing book-not only for children,"i started reading this book a day before easter. i stayed up all night until 5.30 in the morning until i was done, even though i had to get up at 6 next morning. its a heart-warming story about 17-year old Bella who moves to a new town and meets Edward, who turns out to be a vampire. im not a vampire-book fan and not a romance-fan, not at all, i refused to pick the book up for over a month. but once you are over the first, say, 20 pages, you cant put the book down.you instantly like Bella, and Edward, face it, is your perfect guy. i got addicted to this book and its hard to wait until the 2nd book arrives, so i started reading my friends copy, and its totally heartbreaking. very cool though.also, its not only stupid 14-year old high school girls that like the book. i know several adults that told me that after reading the book, youre high. they were right. read this book, its the best one ive read in a long time. do it. NOW!"
5,Best Book Ever!,"I am an avid reader. I have read a very impressive amount of books and I can confindently say that this is hands down, my favorite book ever. It deals with everyday things that teenagers have to go through, yet also mixes in an otherwordly element that makes you get butterflies in your stomach. I was ready to cry when I finished reading this book, and if you havent't read this book yet, you are missing out. I will be checking the website every day from now on, to see when the movie, or second book in the series, New Moon, comes out. I'm hoping it's soon! I don't think I can wait much longer!"
1,Worst Thing I've Ever Read,"No, I'm not just saying this. No, I don't say this out of some sort of sadistic urge to bring down everyone who loves this book. I'm saying this because I feel physically compelled to: this is, by far, the worst book I've ever read. This is a terrible example of ""love"" for teenage girls and I am legitimately afraid of how it could influence a preteen reader in regards to the ways in which men should treat women. Edward is a misogynistic, loathsome monster. Bella is subordinate, refuses to think for herself, and completely dependent on his happiness. Sorry, this isn't true love. This is abuse. Essentially, if you choose to read Twilight, you're choosing to read a middle-aged woman's badly written wet dream. If you want a real romance, read Jane Eyre. Read Les Miserables. They're misogynistic because of the era, but at least the women think for themselves."
1,This book is gag worthy.,"I'm sorry, but this book made me want to throw up in my mouth. Absolutely awful!It's nothing but obsessive, psychotic, stalking garbage.Do yourself a favor and move on to something more readable."
5,I'm in love with a vampire,My friends brought me this book to read and I am addicted. On of the better books I've read in a while. Enjoyable and you could relate to the characters.
5,couldn't put the book down!,very good read for all. i wasn't sure the whole vampire theme would interested me but i was hooked the whole way through. I'm definitely excited to get my hands on the next two books!
3,Buffy for a new generation,"I enjoyed the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which focussed a lot on the love between a mortal and a vampire - and that is what this book is about too but instead of Buffy & Angel, we have Bella and Edward, characters aimed to appeal to teenage girls.I know this book may not rank as great literature, but I found it still a quite enjoyable read (with some silly parts, but not so many that they distracted me). Read this book if you want to kill a few hours but don't expect any scintillating stories or characters. For some true fun and vampire escapism, get the early series of Buffy on DVD. They didn't take themselves tooooooo seriously."
5,Vampires have lasted the test of time,"Although I am not into vampire stories and sci-fi, I found this book interesting. It was a quick read and a compelling story.Imagine being in one of the most successful boy bands of all time, New Edition; Then leave the group to become one of the biggest pop stars in the world; Date some of the most world renown celebrities, such as Janet Jackson and Madonna....Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But..."
2,Children's Book at Best,"The main character Bella is ANNOYING!! She is a constant damsel in distress - always needing her ""perfect"" boyfriend to make her happy (hardly a heroine). This book is alright I guess for pre-teens...I found it to be in the same category as Harry Potter. It could have possibly been better if it had been edited properly...the character's were quite annoying and over-reacted to everything...ah, teenage angst!"
4,comparison,Well read by the narrator. You will probably catch something you may have missed when reading this book. Listening is much more engaging for the imagination.
2,Disappointing,"After all the hype, I found Twilight incredibly disappointing. It starts out pretty strong, but withing a couple chapters the narrator, Bella, and the hero Edward are already madly in love, no build-up, suspense, or obstacles in their way, other than Edward constantly claiming he is ""dangerous."" The real action begins toward the end of the book when a very flat bad guy shows up and (of course) wants to kill Bella for no other reason than pissing off Edward.I do understand that Twilight is aimed at teenagers, but for anyone who's read a real vampire romance, this book is lacking in plot, characterization, and writing alike.If you want well-written paranormal romance, I suggest Sherrilyn Kenyon, Amanda Ashley, or Karen Marie Moning, although they are all more adult and contain sexual material."
1,Wow,This book is fairly awful. the best way I can think to describe it is better done by The Oatmeal.[...]
5,Twilight...A Delight,"I loved this book it was a great start to an awsome series! the characters draw you in and really get you involved with them. it is a love story, yet so much more than that, but in no way cheesy or overdone. the type of vampire Meyer creates in this world is very different, unique, and refreshing. i have been a fan of vampire stuff for a long time and have never seen the vampire done this way. i was very surprised and impressed. anybody from the casual reader to the advid one will love this book. and i will end this with a tip if you have seen the movie and did not like it, which i didn't, don't let it deter you from reading the book because it is SO much better! the movie was like a decaying skeleton of the story and characters, doing them no justice. well happy reading yall! :-D"
2,Disappointing,"After all the hype related to this book, I was anxious to read it. But what a disappointment. Without much interaction, the main character falls madly in love with a vampire---never mind that he could be dangerous, or the fact that she hardly knows him. I found no suspense in the story, nor truth to the characters--they were flat and lifeless. It's not a good mystery and it's not a good love story. I would not recommend it."
3,Special Edition Could Have Been a Bit More Special,"I love this book and have read it over and over and decided that I would like to own the collector's edition. It's nicer than the regular hard cover but maybe my expectations were too high. The quality is questionable, I'm scared to read it for fear it will fall apart (but then again, maybe you aren't supposed to read a collector's edition). The slip cover is cheap and hard to get the book in and out of, I like the ribbon book mark and the antiqued edged pages but was not real impressed with the material of the cover or the slip case."
3,"Its overdone, but its readable.","I like reading different kinds of books, vampire books are one of my favorites and I've read a lot of them. This book is easy to read, it flow, however, in the beginning it is so much like the other vampire books ex: The girl is always really pretty and pale, either the girl is new to the area or its the vampire guy, the vampire guy is always acting strange and warns the girl to stay away but she doesn't, the girl must be saved from harm all the time blah blah. Anyway, the book really picked up in the middle, it became more original, and I wasn't annoyed as much with Bella. I think after the relationship with Edward got more serious, the book became more exciting, and interesting to read."
3,Fairly good book...,"There are parts of this book that seem to drag on and can make the center of the book go really slow, but it picks up in the end. Overall, I enjoyed the book, I just thought it could have been about half as many pages and still had the same outcome, as much of it felt pretty repetitive. I enjoyed the book well enough to continue on through the series. It is one of those nice rainy day books that can just take you to another place. In the end... a rather enjoyable read."
5,Refreshing,"Lovely book, and refreshing after reading Hamilton, Briggs, Harrison and others. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the other authors, but this book, is just so sweet, well written and interesting. I will buy number two."
3,A romantic horror,"When teenagers get the a certain stage they give up on reading and instead opt for outings and MSN with their friends. I bought this novel for my teen daughter because she's interested in 'boys' and 'horror'. She really enjoyed the story. She went and saw the movie TWICE when it came out not long ago, and is looking for an excuse to go and see it again!"
2,The worst ever!,"This is the worst book I have ever read! But before I get tons of backlash, let me add that I really like the four books in general. The writing and the plot of Book 1 was so juvenile! However as you go on through each book it does get better. I was so sick of Bella and Edward telling each other ""I love you"" every few pages.I continued to read the other books in the series under pressure of my friends and was surprised that I actually liked the 3rd and 4rth book. Those two were actually worth laboring through this one and the second."
5,I loved this bbok & the sequel New Moon,"I would not say this book is for ""teens"" as I am a 40 yr old woman & I just LOVED both books. I read them very quickly & cant wait for the next. I am an avid reader, esp. of vampire/werewolf/ paranormal romance books. I highly recommend both Twilight & New Moon. Don't let the ""young adult"" tag scare you away if you are a ""mature adult"" you will still enjoy these books."
3,A pretty good read.,"I just finished reading Twilight for the second time. I do enjoy the book, but there are many things about the book that I find annoying. Bella is not my idea of a perfect heroine. Her whole existence is contingent on Edward and I just find that depressing. I find her character very one dimensional. She's not particularly interesting, or smart, or beautiful, or funny. She's just blah. I do however enjoy the character of Edward. I love the brooding types. I mainly just relate to the all consuming love that occurs in this book. I know what it's like to be in love, and I enjoy reading love stories. So if you're looking for a fairly entertaining love story, then I would recommend this book. If you're looking for flawless writing, characters, plot, then I would not recommend this book."
5,Re-read it as soon as I finished.,"This was one of the few scant books I flipped over and re-read again once finished.I don't see a point in retelling the story with so many reviews, I'll just give my opinion. I loved it. It was just enough in all the elements to make the story pull together nicely. Vampires aplenty, but not overloaded with the supernatural. It's one thing that kills me and turns me off with a lot of fantasy novels. I've read all the way to B.D., so I know that other forces make appearances. My point is, it wasn't crammed into a singular book, and everything was nicely spaced. I recommend this book to anyone who asks.K.K. Jolliffe"
2,Terrible writing,"Meyers is a good story teller, horrible author. These books were written on a level easily read by a 2nd grader. Awful, repetitive sentence structure. It's a good thing these books were turned into a movie, because the book is hardly worth reading. If you have any intelligence at all, I can't imagine that you would think there is any talent behind Meyer's writing skills. Save yourself a couple of hours of reading, and just watch the movie. (Not saying I enjoyed the movie however - but that's how much I disliked her books.)"
3,EMO LOVE STORY,"I'd heard great things about this book, however upon finishing it, I couldn't understand what was so great. First off, this is a love story, and a rather sappy one at that. ""I should not do this! I could hurt you at any moment! I love your floral scent!"" The banter is enough to put the most romantic soul to rest. After about 350 pages of such drivel, there finally comes a thrilling moment that seems kind of eh and then it ends. So in all, not a terrible read, just nothing I'd rather not sink my teeth into again."
5,"Oh, this is a good, silly vampire love story.","I first picked up this book in 2007. It had been misplaced on the Borders 3-for-2 table, and after finding two books that I was excited for, I rushedly grabbed this trade paperback, intrigued by the beauty of its cover. I skimmed the back description, saw that it had something to do with vampires, and figured, well it's free, who knows? The store clerk hadn't wanted to include it in the deal, but when I showed her that two other copies were on the table, she relented. A month or so later, I picked it out of my shelf and started reading it. A few pages in, I stopped - shocked that I had mistakenly picked up a young adult book. And though the language is simple, once the story got going, the book became shockingly engaging. The characters - as silly as sparkling vampires are - do come to life, and the love-triangle is well done. I plan on seeing just where this series goes. It's a fast and fun read that is totally age-appropriate to the YA market."
5,SUPERB!!!,"As a middle school teacher, I read A LOT of YA Fiction. Twilight far exceeded my expectations. The romance in it is fantastic and the mystery and suspense is even better!!! The book is going like wildfire through our school - from our gifted to reluctant readers and no one can wait for the third book in the trilogy!"
5,Awesome Book; can't wait for more!,"This book is a very quick read; it is entertaining and suspenseful, able to keep your interest for hours strait. Definitely the book you stay up to 3AM to finish reading it, and still feel great the next day. Outstanding characters, a witty sense of humor, certainly a good, fresh read. Looking forward for much, much more from this author!"
5,Adds a unique twist to tuck everlasting or the covenant,"I simply couldn't put this book down!17 year old Isabella Swan, ""Bella"" for short, moves to forks to live with her father Charlie. When she arives at her school, at lunch, she spots a group of people who stand out more, to her at least, soon realizing they are vampires. She falls in love with Edward Cullen, and... well.. you'll just have to read the rest."
4,It becomes addictive -- in a good way.,"One of my 8th grade students suggested this series to me. I am quite glad she did. Once I began reading Twilight, I was hooked. It took me one week to read all four published in the series. I, at first, did not feel any warmth for Edward, but then as I began to understand him better, I became lukewarm about his role. The overbearingness of his character is frustrating, and I never quite got used to it, and the co-dependency of all of the characters is a bit disarming for a middle school female to read, but I must say, if the book/s can be read and discussed intelligently, it's great to have yet another avenue that young teens can follow in reading. The vocabulary and sentence structures are more complicated than what teens usually read. I'm happy with Twilight and those that follow, although the last of the series is, I believe, 150 pages too long."
3,"Oh, pleeeze...","I have no problem whatsoever imagining vampires living in Washington State, going to high school and fighting grizzly bears with their bare hands...but...a man who actually wants to know what a woman is thinking?!? There is no such thing! An amusing story, with very true to life depictions of teen angst, but it's a shame to let young women fill their heads with such a far-fetched fantasy as that."
5,by far,"this was by far one of the greatest books i have ever read. it was ""Phee-nom!"" the details and characters just pull you right in. i read it on my trip back home and i didn't sleep at all. Thats 24 hours awake reading! fantastic book. 5 stars. and 2 thumbs up!"
1,Lacking in every way a book could lack,"At the risk of bodily harm and being disowned by a friend of mine who is fan I'm going to say that to compare this with Harry Potter series is an insult to J.K. Rowling to say the least. I tried to give this book a chance and it failed miserably. It was page after page boring narration and over description. The character development was poor to say the least and the story went nowhere. Bella's character was worse than a Mary Sue as she lack any substance or qualities fitting a main character/heroine. Edward is a parody of a vampire at best as I felt he either just moped or brooded around half the time or stalked Bella the other half. After fifteen pages I just wanted the book to end already. And to twilight fans, no I am not jealous of Stephanie Meyer and I don't think Stephen King is either."
2,"Well written, but I had a few issues","I was drawn in at the beginning of the book with the way Meyer makes everyday tasks seem interesting. That was all that was interesting though. Bella and Edward weren't very pleasant characters. Bella is insecure and overly obsessive, Edward is brooding and not very friendly. If he is in love with Bella he certainly doesn't act like it. There didn't some to be much plot, girl falls in love with boy, boy says he is in love with girl, but it doesn't seem like it, then, all of the sudden there is danger and drama. It seemed a little contrived. I read through the entire book quickly because it was an easy read and it was well written, but the plot isn't really that special, it can be summed up in one or two sentences. There was no mystery, the action in it seemed to come out of no where for no reason. I will probably continue to read the series to see what happens, but if it continues to be so dry, I may quit."
4,"A thought-provoking book, meant to entertain","I'm sure that, by this point, you're well aware of this novel's plot, so I'm not going to waist too much time with that. Basically, an ordinary girl falls in love with a vampire. He's perfect but their relationship seems impossible.Regarding the criticism surrounding Bella's ""average"" or ""self-absorbed"" character, and even the grammatical errors people are fussing over, I have one thing to say. We read books for the purpose of entertainment, and in some cases learning. This books provide just that, and what more can we ask for?Of course, this is no classic book that is going down in history, but it is a wonderful read that has the potential to make you think hard about life as you know it."
5,Twilight,"I brought this book for my 13 year old teenage daughter, she was totally involved with this book. She wouldn't put it down! She was excited by the book because it gave much more background and many more details than the movie. She loved it! She is currently on the second book of the series and enjoying every minute. It was well worth the money I spent for it."
5,Not just for teenagers!,"My over 60 year old Mother, who is also a Grandmother read all the books in the Twilight series. She loved them so much , she kept bugging me to read them. Vampires? Teenagers in love? No thank you, I said. I finally gave in, but thought I'd read Twilight for a few pages to say I did try it, but once I began reading I was hooked on this story. It is one of the best love stories of forbidden love around. Once I finished Twilight I wanted more of Edward and Bella's story. It is that good! I am a Mom in my thirties and would rank these books as my all time favorites. My daughters are still little, but if they were about 14 I'd feel safe having them read these books. The love story is old fashion & sweet & deeply moving. Even though I am in my 30's, I hate cursing and over the top sex scenes in books. I also don't like Vampire books, as a general rule....but give this a try. All the books are great in this series. Twilight, however is the best one!"
2,Ignore the Hype,"I bought this book because of a recommendation by a local radio personality. The book went to #1 locally following her mention of it on the radio so I took the bait. BIG disappointment! This thing is soooo boring. I can't imagine why so many people love it so much. The characters have no depth and apparently nothing much going on in their lives, since so far, we've gone to school, gone shopping, gone to school, gone to the beach and daydreamed about how gorgeous the local vampire dude is and how great he smells. Hmmm...could have been the local football jock or any other ""untouchable"" popular, dangerous-type boy I guess, and it still would not have been interesting. I guess I could be too old for this book (over 40), or maybe I was hoping it would compare to the Anne Rice vampire novels (not even close) but I will not buy the other three."
2,eye - yi - eye!,"Here's the best way to get through this flaccid tale of young love: every time the word ""eyes"" appears, take a shot. You'll be well and truly sloshed every ten pages but it makes reading ""Twilight"" a whole lot easier. Good grief! This writer needs a darn good editor. Take out all the teen introspection and endless descriptions of eyes, hair, faces, and hands, it would be half as long -- and that's a good thing! Very disappointing."
4,Little Above Average,"Let me first say, I did enjoy ""Twilight"". It was creative, inventive, and clean of smuck. An easy going read with interest. The character's were as odd and intriguing as Margaret Atwood's amazing character creations, and story was simple as Scholastic Childrens Publications. The story line had a nice plot structure. And her use of lore was definiatly not over the top. Good Teen Vampire Romance.But... (Yes there is a ""but"")Was it a Global Series Hit Wonder like Harry Potter? No. It wasn't. Such was suggested to me by many. I wasn't let down per se, but neither was I excitedly agawed by it."
4,Amazing But Not Without Faults,"Everyone has heard of TWILIGHT by now. Girls fawn over it, boys either hate it or secretly like it, and parents seem to stand by it for the most part.The idea is simple enough. Bella Swan moves to Forks to stay with her dad. While there she meets the mysterious Cullen family and then she falls in love with the dazzling son Edward. What makes it so good is it's incredibly well written. The book is laced with tension and the characterization makes the characters feel (for the most part)real. That's the good.The bad sadly took a star off my review. 1)Bella's relationship with her parents is odd, to say the least. 2) Bella has no hobbies or goals, something that seems weird for a teenager. 3) Edward is described as gorgeous...seven times each chapter. 4)Bella's pretty rude to her other friends. 5) The action seems misplaced in the story. 6) Bella and Edward just WHAM fall in love.Overall though, it's a fast paced and innovative novel."
5,what can i say?,"this is the most AMAZING book! A lovestruck vampire? What more could you want? I didn't like Bella in the beginning because, to me, she spontaneously liked a mysterious guy for reason. What makes this book worthwhile is its ROMANCE! Its sweet, innocent, and death-defying love! Read it! I highly recommended for all teenage girls especially. You'll fall in love with Edward before you can say ""bite me."""
5,Absolute Page Turner,This is another great book from Meyer. I discovered this series and I am SO glad I did. I checked out Twilight from the library and as soon as I finished it I promptly bought the whole set online. This book will keep you turning until you finish and then leave you wanting for more!
2,No sex. No violence. And the vampires aren't very scary,"I know this is a popular book, but I thought it was missing all the important elements of a vampire romance. The first 350 pages were all about who sits next to whom in the school cafeteria, and how to politely say no if you don't want to go to a dance.The last 150 pages were spent running away from a vampire fight that never really happened. Okay, it did happen, but it happened somewhere else, while the heroine was unconscious.My biggest complaint? Lack of angst. Nobody suffered. They talked about how some of them suffered in the past, but you didn't really feel it. The only feeling you got was of a bunch of overly calm high schoolers handling cafeteria politics.I wonder why such a bland book is getting such rave reviews, when there are so many more exciting ones available."
5,"I Live In Forks, Washington","The main reason I got this book was because the setting is the town I live in, Forks, Washington. Stephenie Meyer has got our little town to a tea! I literally could not put this down once I started reading, (note to self: reading and cooking dinner at the same time makes smoke detector go off, and everybody gets upset)What an amazing writer Ms Meyer is, and I can't WAIT for part two! I noticed I'm looking a little closer at my neighbors in the Thriftway store now, to see if they might be one of the 'cold ones'. Incredible book!"
4,An awesome revolution in hygiene!,"Exelent product! Every of the 544 pages are extremley soft and surprisingly don't make any cuts or anything! This is by far the biggest revolution in toilet paper: Instead of being rolled, now it comes in the form of a book! Stephen Meyer is an exellent toilet paper designer, I'm looking foward to also buy her next products. Dang, this paper is so cleaner than the usual toilet papers!I just don't give it a 5 because I noticed someone left some small letters drawn on the paper, but who cares? Now excuse me so I can buy another copy, I am almost out of ""towilighet"" paper!"
1,$20 Down the Drain...,"I bought this book about a year ago, buying it for a friend as a gift. I heard it was good, and decided to borrow one to check it out.It feels like I am the ONLY teenage girl that not only does not like the book/series, but absolutely hates it. There are many well-written reviews about this book here, and they can get more in-depth than I care to.Keeping it short:- Cliche and boring- Insult to human intelligence- Essentially an allusion to Mormonism (I can provide links to anyone who would like to read up on this)- Horrible plot holesJust a filler for the female Harry Potter fans that don't know what good fiction is."
2,not all that great,"this book was ok but everone is stuck on this book. yeah it wasnt that bad it just wasnt all that great there are so many books out there that was way better then this. people need to move on everyone is fantasizing about being bella and having a perfect relationship.p.s vampires are dead they have no heart , so how can they be romantic and sexy?"
3,A poorly written great story!,"I thought the idea for this story was great. I was on the edge of my seat through out the whole thing, and couldn't wait to find out what happened. I also thought Bella and Edward's relationship was romantic and enjoyed their story. HOWEVER, I thought it was very poorly written. It seemed as if it was written by someone in middle school. The language was simplistic and repetitive and Bella's character was helpless and annoying. I gave it three stars, though, because I thought it was a fantastic idea for a story, and I really did want to know what would happen. The writing, however, made it hard to get there. I truly wish Bella had been a stronger and more intelligent character. I hope this makes sense! I'm really on the fence with this one."
3,A Good Cliche,"This book is a cliche. A good one at that but it is still a cliche. The book was a cliche that had more in depth than any other book that I have read like it.Many people-girls-like the books because they are in love with Edward. In some ways I don't think they notice much of Bella. Instead of noticing Bella they pretended they are Bella.I enjoyed all of the book and not because like so many others I am in love with Edward, but because I can appretiate the whole book.New Moon was better because it was stepping away from the cliche of the first.The first book was still very good. I would recommend it and its sequel."
4,Good Read,"Book one is setting the stage for the rest of the series. It's a little slow in parts, but is a good read."
5,Inviting and captivating....,"This book I bought as a mistake...(didn't know it was a teen novel until about 3/4 the way through)...(I am 39) I started reading it anyway..It completely captivated me! I sat and read the book and when I was not reading the book- I craved the book!!! when I got to the end- I was sad, because I wanted to read more!!! So I ran out and bought New Moon (Sequel)(which I felt kind of foolish going to the teen section to find it) even though I tried to ease my craving by taking one nibble at a time I gave in to it.......I could not put it down!Well written and believeable-(vampires & all) you felt unbelievable compassion for these characters..I felt I knew them and wanted to know more about them and there is Edward...Ahhhh the way she describes him you can't help but fall in love with him too, like Bella..Hoping the 3rd one will be out soon and 4th and 5th etc etc..."
2,Angst and more Angst,"Everyone who sold me on reading this series told me each book is better than the one previous so I managed to make it through 2 and 1/2 books before I gave up. I give it two stars because Ms. Myers can write, but she uses that ability to give us thirty pages of story and several hundred pages more of extremely repetitive inner dialogue.I found some of her characters interesting, and the books might have been much better if we saw their stories and Bella (the main character) was sent to go agonize quietly in a corner where she couldn't bother anyone else.I can see a much younger audience being attracted to this series but the adult following baffles me. (And this is NOT a critique of fiction aimed at a younger readership, I love Harry Potter and Neil Gamman's Graveyard Book.)Becuase this book isn't so much about young love as young angst. Lots and lots of angst. And we all gotta go through it. But relive it?"
5,OMG- Stephanie is MY NEW FAVE AUTHOR,"Oh my lord. This book is unbelievably good. I started reading it Saturday morning and I couldn't put it down. Literally. My parents walked in my room at 5:45 in the morning and thought I was mentally unstable for staying up to read a book all night. Whatever bad reviews you hear about this book must be from crazy asylum patients in Romania (pun intended) I raved about this book so much that my best friend ( who by the way won't finish a book if her life depends on it) read it in three days. It then got passed on to my other friend, who is constantly asking what happens. We LOVE this book! Stephanie- If you read this review- please- PLEASE write a sequel! My friends were almost hyperventilating at the THOUGHT- anyway guys, if you have any money at all- im telling you- it should be spent on this book, or a great spa day. LOL- enjoy reading!"
3,the book is decent,"and it's an interesting take on old and worn out vampire stories. it's not ever going to receive a nobel prize, but it's entertaining and a nice place to retreat to for some reading time alone on a rainy day with a glass of red wine."
5,A MUST READ BOOK,"I loved this book and I have already read the second one in the series. I can not wait until the third book is released. The characters are awesome, it makes me wish that I was there with them."
1,TERIIBLE BOOK!,"I was given this book for Christmas by my nieces, who LOVED it, and I felt I had to read it. It was a torture that I haven't felt since I was an undergraduate and had to read Milton. I thought it must be me, but I saw some similar reactions at the Amazon site, and I was happy to see in a news report today that Stephen King agrees. Stephenie Meyer is a terrible writer who has created flat and vapid characters; besides, there is no suspense. I'll get my vampires on the True Blood series and read no more Meyer!"
5,First book that got me reading!,"I never used to like reading before this book. I loved this book because it was a exciting page turner to me. I love that fact that in this book action, and romance take place. That's what gets girl readers going. I loved the series!"
