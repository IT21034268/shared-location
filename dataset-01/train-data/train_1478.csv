3,What's it gonna be - Busta Ryhmes,"Worthwhile CD, entertaining and sets the mood I was looking for when purchased. Glad to have added this one to my collection"
3,A how to book and that's about it,"David Finn's How to Visit a Museum is a good starter book for one who wants a quick starter course in museums and art. What to look for and how to view art. I think this would be a great book for teachers and new art students. I bought this book second hand and enjoyed it as a quick refresher course. However as a whole it seemed more of a short book for tourists, as I finished it in sitting. However if you want to read a book before you travel to a large museum I would highly recommend this as a starter book for a journey into the world of art."
3,Decent if unrealiable,"Dennis Olson (Ph.D. Yale; Princeton Seminary OT prof.) is an extremely careful and thoughtful scholar, with a world-class reputation. This is an above-average entry in this highly uneven Interpretation series.Olson has a 'canonical' approach which, while accepting critical views of the Bible, makes them secondary. And this Interpretation series is geared for pastoral application. Nevertheless, his critical assumption sometimes overwhelm his interpretations. I would not use this as my first or only commentary on Numbers.Often lively and original, this makes solid (and readable) supplemental study for the student who wants a range of opinions on the text."
5,A delightful little triptych,"This episode made me love again...well no...let's not dish further in that direction. What I do think I know is that someone took out the genre wheel and made some damn fine entertainment. Yes, I could describe the details of this episode, these dances to a measure; diamonds of love; diamonds of hope and diamonds less than forever but that would be less than a goat for you dear reader. Let's just say between me and you, anonymous lookers of other people's tapitty taps, there be some spectacular creativity towards the end of the season. Just a fun episode. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did but if you don't mmm boyyo. Thank you."
4,"Quantum Physics and Malt Liquor, Smells Like Futurama","We begin with yet another iteration of Panucci's famous ""FRY, PIZZA GOIN OUT. COME ON!?!!"" followed by a classic example of Fry's stupidity and boyish naivet√©. (see I.C. Weiner). Finally realizing he has been in a dead end job for over 1000 years he opts to do something about it. The episode explodes with criminals both past and future (referencing the Tom Cruise flick, Minority Report), high speed (we're talking 15 over the speed of light) chases and Schrodinger known for his nobel prize, cats and drug smuggling. Unique characters are introduced (the gender role-reversing Chief of Police O'Manahan) and old favorites are expanded (Officer Earl). Bender attempts another crazy heist and the Hedonism Bot makes his classic, less than ambiguous advances on pretty much everyone. A formidable mix of sex, poop and non-Newtonian physics jokes."
3,Meeeeh.,"Okay episode. Not great. Kind of forgettable. I'd say worth watching once, but would I watch it again? Maybe if I was doing laundry or something..."
5,Insightful and Nerdy,"Personally, I like shows that tinker with the same ideas I ponder; this episode is the conflict between the individual and the relationship. Funny tech humor, tech-economy satire, and a good dollop of meaty plot driven by the complex relationships between the characters.Enjoyable episode."
2,Strays from science to mimic Sunday night FOX,The value of this series is typically it's creative use of the setting to explain and posit far-out theories/innovative ways to view the future... there is a seen where Leela is cut in half and her torso is hopping near the appended legs... i guess that's funny... but not what I expect from Futurama.
2,One of the Worst Episodes of the Season,"I love Futurama, and have been known to watch episodes of the show repeatedly. This is one episode I can't even bring myself to finish. It's that boring.I really think this season has been hit or miss, and this episode was a definite miss."
3,"Not as good as classic Futurama seasons, but has some gems","If you are a true fan, you will find these episodes somewhat lacking. Go straight to episodes ""The Common Cold"" 'Fry am the Egg Man"" and ""Reincarnation"" for the best this season has to offer."
2,What happened?,"Futurama used to be a fantastic, wonderful series. It was smart, witty, and fun. It seems now that they are on Cable, they've lost their wit. It seems as though the writers have given up on 'witty', and have instead decided that people are too stupid for intelligent story lines, favoring a repetitive, painfully sexualized, brand of... well, dumb-people-entertainment.It's disheartening, really. It used to be one of the best things on television."
1,Are you serious?,"This is a complete rip off of KOTH. These writers get paid way to much money to copy ideas. This is Futurama, where you can virtually do anything. And you copy?! LAME!From a huge Futurama fan."
1,A copy of the Simpsons!,"Yes, yes, I know he is the creator of both, but really??? He has nothing new? Futurama came back on just to copy other shows? Futurama had original show ideas and that is why I watched it and not the others.LAME!"
3,Appalachian Setting,McCrumb greatly sets her books in the Appalachian. She is very detailed about the surroundings in the appalachia.
5,AWESOME!,"As a long time Staind fan it is great to have a full concert in HD. The footage and sound are great, I just wish Aaron would stop smoking cigs and save his voice."
2,Eh,"This cut-price disc is serviceable as an introduction to Flamenco. The guitar playing and vocals here are nothing more or less than competent, though the hand clapping of the fandango that opens the album is embarrassingly inept. In consideration of this album's title, the absence of any audible dancing in accompaniment with this music is quite conspicuous. The performer(s?) are uncredited, which may be for the best. As a newcomer's first Flamenco album, this could be both worse and a lot better."
2,"Very good , very LITTLE.","I am very sorry that I did not get a hardcover copy. The paperback is a stapeled together , very flimsy booklet."
2,a narrow view,"this really is, as the other reviewer wrote, a one-sided view. i would browse this book in a store and if it really strikes you then go get jeff wall, philip lorca dicorcia, or gregory crewdson and see some much better work."
3,Don't Mess With Tarzan the Wonder Horse!,"A memorable introduction to Ken Maynard and his famous palomino. One of the cowboy star's best efforts, ""Come On, Tarzan"" (1932) benefits from an offbeat storyline and Ken's expert riding. Alan James directs in rustic, no-nonsense fashion. Co-star Merna Kennedy was Charlie Chaplin's leading lady in ""The Circus"" (1928)."
4,look out the window,in rhythmic text;a tale to teach children to be happy with what they have in their lives as well as the family they have
1,"First, Ogilvy on Advertising. Now Forrest Gump....","A complete waste of time that is painfully boring to read. I would sell my used copy on this site, but I have a conscience."
1,This book is a sad commentary on the business.,"""The best work in the world won't keep a client if the relationship goes bad. But it is amazing how the best relationship can keep a client, even if the work is far from the best.""Hello??? The relationship between a client and an agency should be about the work. Not about golf or birthday cards or friendships or any of that fluff. Consequently, the best relationships get the best work. Period.Solomon says you can sell work of any caliber if you're tight enough with the client. Basically, this is saying that a good relationship can help you to ""put one over on the client"" and put the agency's interests before the client's.This is brain surgery alright. To be exact, it's a lobotomy."
1,"From the folks who brought you gems like ""Act Now!""","This book is the worst of both worlds -- it's tired AND pedantic. In fact, the only engaging part is the cartoons. It offers zero insights & drones on like a bad salesman in a cheap suit talking your ear off at a cocktail party. Save your money and don't take advice about advertising from direct mail people; they're different animals. If you really want a good read about the business, try John Steel's book or, better yet, David Ogilvy's Confessions of an Advertising Man. Ogilvy's book is a 30-year old classic and is written with timeless wit & aplomb. And in a nutshell, the difference between Ogilvy's book and Solomon's book is precisely the difference between advertising and direct mail: Good advertising is creative, engaging & disarming, whereas direct mail is nothing more than a blunt instrument devoid of any charm."
1,Pure Genius!,"This book is an inspiration to anyone who demands excellence in his life. I read it to help my career, but also to help my life as a whole. It's soothing. And the writer is not only funny & smart, but funny, smart & looks a little like Chewbacca from Star Wars. (My favorite wookie!)"
2,Don't be fooled - this is for someone with no people skills.,"I was very disappointed with this book. I purchased it based on the reviews on Amazon, but the book offers only the very basics of customer relationship management tips. The only reason I give it 2 stars is for beginners. Also, the material is not backed up with examples or stories to prove out the concepts, as I have found in other sales and relationship management books. It looks like the author put very little effort into this, and cranked it out in a day."
5,"A reference every ""suit"" should own",Brain Surgery for Suits is an indispensable reference book that should live on the bookshelf of every suit.Written by one of the best.
3,A Misnomer by any other name,"I picked up this book, expecting it to be about Franz Liszt and the society that surrounded him. What i got was a rather poorly told murder mystery, surrounding an heiress. It briefly alludes to Liszt's affair with Marie d'Agoult, but only briefly. Other famous names are mentioned, such as Hector Berlioz and Eugene Delacroix, but they are treated in the same brief fashion, as Liszt and his countess.Not a truly bad story, all said, but i do wish more attention had been paid to the title character and his life, and not the second-rate plot line."
3,I almost loved it,"It started out very promisingly, not the usual historical romance. Sadly though it degenerated into a farcical ending trying to use all the characters up in a mad dash for the ending and untimately not believeable.I especially disliked how the father's character was drawn so reprehensibly and at the end we are expected to believe he shunned his daughter her whole life just so he could commit suicide to ""save"" her in the end. Oh please.Liszt sounds so fascinating (after a search on Wikipedia) that a better story should be written with him as the main character."
3,Good historical fiction,"Hopefully, if you are reading this review, you haven't read Susanne Dunlap's first novel ""Emilie's Voice"", otherwise you wouldn't be wondering about this novel. Liszt's Kiss is a very well written and readable novel. It will leave you happy that you took the time to read it and you may even recommend it to others. Not so with Ms. Dunlap's first novel. If you had to sum it up with one word, it would be ""pointless"". You can get through it because you keep hoping it is going somewhere, but it doesn't. It dies about two thirds of the way through it, and neither Ms. Dunlap nor her publisher had the kindness to stop the misery and bury the poor story. It is obvious that Ms. Dunlap is a good writer and, luckily, stuck with it to write a decent second book. Luckily I read the second first or I never would have read another book of hers because the firts one is so bad."
3,"I'm not quite done with it yet, but....","Didn't anyone else have as difficult a time as I am getting through this book? The only thing keeping me going is the mysterious circumstances that are obviously building in the storyline. Otherwise, the characters are flat, the storyline confusing and the romance aspect somewhat irritating. It started out promising, but I find myself having to make time just to sit down and read it. I read the author's previous book and enjoyed it; I expected to feel the same with this, but you know what they say about second attempts."
4,Durango kids was a great movie for kids,"This movie kept my kids entertained. They are 9,7,and 4. It was a great movie that the kids could watch and i didnt have to worry about the content. It had both my daugters and sons engrossed with the 4 four wheelers and the horses and how the kids put peanut butter on things. They thought that was funny. It's a good movie that you should buy."
2,Silly disappointing kid movie,"Colorado's San Juan Mountains from Durango to Silverton to Ouray is myfavorite place to vacation in the USA. So when I saw the preview ofDurango Kids on another DVD, I decided to rent it on Netflix. It isone of those movies where villains are cartoonish, and the kids, whilecute, outsmart all the stupid adults. The first 30 minutes showed somenice locations in and around Durango, including the steam train (that'swhy I purchased a used copy) but then it goes into time travel to saveOuray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore,intended for young and undemanding children. Don't bother unless youlove Durango as much as I do."
2,Not very impressed,"I wanted a really compact notebook case that I could throw in a larger briefcase or backpack or carry-on bag when necessary. This is as minimal as it gets since there isn't any room for anything but a few papers. But I knew that before buying it, so I'm not complaining (though a tiny bit of space for SOMETHING) wound be nice. I bought the leather one instead of the nylon one and am regretted it. The leather looks really cheap (like vinyl), the shoulder strap and the AC adapter add-on are both nylon. IMO, that just looks stupid having part leather, part nylon. While I didn't use it to lug around my MacBook, the padding does look nice & solid and would almost certainly offer good protection. I'll probably order the nylon model instead but I'm also going to look around for other options."
1,Useless,It can fit the laptop and a few flat sheets of paper only; not even room enough for the power cable or a mouse. Who needs that??
4,great case,"This laptop gives core protection for macbook. It only lacks an additional space to put your remote,headphones and other stuff.i recommend this case for anyone who has a macbook."
1,Not space for anything but the laptop !,This notebook case only have space for the laptop. It doesn't have room even for a mouse and the power cord.Beware to buy this.
1,This thing blows!,I've had smaller laptop bags that both protected my laptops better and still offered me plenty of space to put things away. This thing can barely hold my laptop and papers! Let alone the adapter or extra cables! It defeats the purpose of even bothering with a laptop bag! I'm gonna have to try and sell it or give it away!
3,Not Bad For A Potboiler,"They (some reviewers, copy on the back of books) always say Sheffield is ""the"" or ""a"" top hard-sci-fi writer. Well, that must not be coming from the ones I've read--definitely not this one. This is a good airport novel. That's where I picked it up and read it. It's got a big disaster, plenty of sex, a daring return from a mission to Mars, desperate cancer survivors, a Hannibal Lector type character, a visionary cult leader, and some political intrigue, all thrown together pretty cheesily. It's fun to read but you wont be telling all your friends about it. Most of the characters are one dimensional, and he has a lurid, exagerrated view of politics--the President ""runs"" the country, and politicians are far more sleazy in interesting ways than in real life, and execute far more bloodthirsty and deft maneuvers than they manage to pull off in real life. Would make a fun trashy cable mini-series."
2,After taste is more like it,"I enjoyed the first third of this book when the disaster was unfolding. Once the people moved front and center it was still interesting, if a lot less exciting. But, while the premise held promise (if no scientific credence),things started going downhill rapidly when the focus turned more to diddling than disaster. Am I the only one who finds pages devoted to whether two old guys get laid a bit out of place here? And, as we started running out of pages, I realized I was going to have to buy ANOTHER book to find out how it ends. That may make the author rich but it's patently unfair to the reader. I bought a whole book; I expect a whole story. Lucifer's Hammer is, hands down, one of the best. This is, hands down, not."
2,Dull,"I gave it two stars because I never actually finished it and it could have magically gotten better at the end. The beginning never takes off in my opinion. If the nation is in chaos I want to know how people are surviving, not have to plod through pages of the prez's get together with his ""beautiful"" aide while he internlly moralizes to himself about whether or not he should sleep with her. YAWN. Lucifer's Hammer, Alas Babylon, Cancticle for Liebowitz all MUCH better."
2,This is Sheffield?,"What begins as a thrilling hard-SF novel painfully developes into a hodgepodge of uninteresting characters and sluggish storylines. The ""Aftermath"" of a world cataclysm is seen through the eyes of loners, racists and a hauntingly ""Clintonesque"" president. What's missing are real people. Where are the communities, cultures and societies that must rebuild the world? I don't think children are even mentioned except as a few underground cult members.This is my 4th Sheffield novel and it doesn't compare to his earlier works. It lacks excitement, surprise and humor. ""Tomorrow and Tomorrow"", ""Godspeed"" and ""Cold as Ice"" are much better reads and, the lame attempt to attract my attention at the end of this novel only convinced me not to read the sequels."
4,A preview of what Y2K could bring us.,"Other reviewers have been thorough as to plot, causative events, subsequent events, etc. BUT WHAT THEY MISSED is the applicability of this book to those of us preparing for what Y2K may bring. Sheffield covers much of the down and dirty details of personal survival and national recovery that we may soon face. Some of the technological details in this novel, such as the cancer plot and the cooked southern hemisphere, are obviously a stretch compared to where we are now. But the religious cults, the failed microchips and high-tech equipment are all in the cards for January 2000. I learned much about what I have overlooked in my preparations and how others would react to systemic and global collapse."
4,Intriguing beginning goes slightly south,"Post holocaust type SF novel that has a touch of Allen Drury 1960's style political intrigue. The beginning is intriguing and fast paced, then the story settles down some. I have to say I liked it anyway and am interested in how things will turn out in the sequel."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY !,"Sheffield destroys what could have been [AT BEST] a mediocre disaster tale with his politically correct stereotyping of the leading characters. The only reason this effort was given one star is it's relatively interesting scenario of the possible effects of a supernova upon the earth. Unfortunately,once the stage is set Charles Sheffield chooses not to concentrate on the tale of earth & it's peoples response to this great challenge,but instead on his politically correct stereotypes and their various sexual inadequacies and perversions. Truly a waste of paper & ink. For a great end-of-the-world saga,read Stephen Baxter's ""Moonseed"" [1998] Enough said!"
4,"Once again, Sheffield's storytelling and characters shine.","I throughly enjoyed this book, and the pseudo-ending did not bother me a bit - I have two more books to look forward to.Not much hard sci-fi, but the characters, as in most of Mr. Sheffield's works, really define this the book."
3,"Interesting, but left too much wide open for my taste.","This was a decent read, but if this is a part 1 of three, I wish it would have advertised it on the cover. I think the book would have been more interesting if it had dealt more with the struggles of ""average joes"" who are fighting to survive in an average city following the Supernova. Instead, we are treated to the stories of a serial killer, the president, some astronauts, and some terminal cancer patients. Howabout a bit regarding Bob, the guy next door? Also, this book didn't seem to contain that much ""hard"" information to me, certainly nothing that anyone who's paid attention in high school and watched ""Goldeneye"" didn't already know."
3,part 1 of 3 ?,"Interesting start, but clearly the first of three. Way too many loose ends, Sheffield is not sloppy. Most amusing part is the grey panthers showing the youths how to cope with life without microchips (I would be one of them). Stay tuned for resolution of important questions, like what blew up Alpha (Niven's ""culthang bronte"" ?) and why Althea knew about it."
2,Sloppy and Disjointed,"The only strong point of this book is the character development. Other than that, Sheffield takes a rather intriguing scenario and promptly drives it into the ground. There are too many concurrent sub-plots to be able to fully develop and resolve in a book of this length. The result is a lot of jumping around from one group of characters to another until there is abrupt ending in the last chapter whithout resolution of many issues. It doesn't even tantalize enough for one to look to a sequel for the continued development of plotlines."
3,"Cheap watch, missleading information",It says Indiglo night light...this is not true.The watch is too small for my wrist...I gave it away to my teenage boy...There are better for the same price out there
4,My Son just loved it,"My teenage Son was really happy to receive this watch. It's not too big and has a ""COOL"" factor to it with the TMX brand. All in all a great purshase."
1,Not the item pictured,"I did not get the item pictured. I got what looks like a standard fobus holster, which I believe are pretty cheaply made. This one looked more promising."
5,"Light, Colour, Angels and your Higher Self.","The first book in her series on using the Light for healingand spiritual changes.Includes powerful meditationsand inspiring examples for easy and practical instructionon such methods as Constructing a Bridge of Light to theHigher Realms, energizing our physical bodies, and experiencinghe expansive energy of love. She makes it sound as matter offact and as easy as making a batch of your favourite cookies!"
1,Total disappointment,"This is not really a GeForce 4 MX 440 chipset-based video card. I ordered and received a GeForce 2 MX 400 chipset-based card. Actually, it is Diamond Stealth's S70. I was so disappointed when I received it because Diamond cards' quality is terrible, and I had very bad experiences with this brand before. I wanted to return it but I received an equal card again. My conclusion is either details of this product are wrong or Amazon people are completely ignorant about the difference between those two chipsets. I've learned my lesson, I will never buy a hardware component from Amazon. Amazon is good selling books, DVDs, CDs and even some electronics. But when dealing with hardware, I would prefer to find a specialized store. Don't buy this card, it is not worth, there are much better cards in the market for similar prices, and furthermore the Diamond brand might be the worst in video cards."
2,Meh,"The book is good in that it explains certain basic immunological techniques quite well in a descriptive sense (at least at the molecular leve), however graphically many things are left to be desired. Many topics like explaining detailed immunofluorescent or protein immunology, etc are woefully inadequate for any practical use. The first third of the book explaining immunological processes is hopeless and best left to a dedicated immunology textbook like Janeway or Abbas."
1,Clear as mud.,"This book couldn't decide what it wanted to be. There were sections that were very detailed and not clearly explained. On the other hand, there were sections that were lacking significant explanation and contained so little detail that it was impossible to understand.Also, if I had to read 'close proximity' one more time, I would have screamed. Someone should explain to the author AND THE EDITOR that this is redundant. I circled those words MULTIPLE times. Reading such a poorly written book made me wonder what else was poorly described and possible incorrect."
4,Good review,"The book's layout of the information is very informative, yet easy to read and understand. Very good CLS textbook. I highly recommend this textbook for student's taking Clinical Immunology."
2,Shark,If only looks painted the whole picture. When you first put the shark in he looks great and his swimming is great as well. However the shark basically sticks to the sides of the pool and follows it until it ends up getting sucked in by the (whatever the suction thing is called in a pool)My advice by the multiple fish instead of the shark.
4,very good collection of conversations,This collection of conversations between Frank Miller and Will Eisner is quite good they cover a lot of topics and present their views well. Clearly they are passionate about comics. A little more depth on comics aesthetics and maybe some more personal info or opinions on some non comics issues and this would be 5 stars. Charles Brownstein did a good job of organizing and editing for publication the original conversations probably lasted much longer nad would havetaken up many more pages
3,Interesting In Parts,"In this series of transcribed conversations between legends Will Eisner and Frank Miller, they touch on a variety of themes. These include graphic storytelling theory, gossip about people in the industry and the overriding argument: comic books are a valid art form.REPEAT: Comic Books are a valid art form. They dwell on this topic to the point where the reader wonders if Miller and Eisner themselves are totally convinced of it. In any case, who are they trying to persuade? This book's readership obviously takes comics seriously. Why else would they buy a book of conversations between Frank Miller and Will Eisner?In spite of this, the discussions of Graphic storytelling and the impressionistic quality of comic book art are fascinating and some of the gossip is amusing.I especially like Eisner's story of what happened when Stan Lee asked him to take over at Marvel Comics."
3,Different versions,"I did not read the fine print, (new recordings by original artist. All of the songs were by the original artist but the songs are slightly different from the originals recordings. Not the same as the studio versions or the popular versions that were played on the radio. If you are not familiar with the original versions, I guess these songs would be okay but personally I don't like them and I can tell the difference. I would not buy this cd again. Great song titles but poor versions."
2,Music is just plain lame,"My bought this hoping that my kids would be able to finally sing along with one of the songs. In an effort to ""jazz up"" these kids songs, many of them are difficult to sing a long with.The seller was great. I'm just not impressed with this Fisher Price System. Neither are my kids."
1,Not 48 tracks on my CD--Incorrectly Advertised!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The CD I received from Amazon only contained 24 tracks.Buyer Beware.
1,Toro not what it used to be,"My father was a big fan of Toro. The last snowthrower he bought I inherited and it lasted for 25 years. When I needed a new one, I bought this one. This is the third winter for it and at the beginning of each season I have to have it serviced because it won't start, even though I run all the gas out of it in the Spring as required. I may have gotten a lemon, because it certainly has left a sour taste in my mouth for Toro. Very disappointing."
1,Toro 38182 Frustration,"I was given this unit as a gift in 2003. I've used it probably 30 times in these past five years. Each year I run the tank dry and when winter approaches I fill the tank with fresh gas and oil. Despite that the unit has stalled repeatedly, has been difficult to start using either the electric starter or by pulling and is easily overcome by the snow in the northeast. When I contacted the local Toro recommended dealer, he stated that since I had to store the unit outside in the winter, it was probably too cold for the unit to start (18 degrees F).Based on my experience with this expensive unit that repeatedly stalls or fails to start, I would not recommend purchasing a CCR Powerlite 325, model 38182."
1,worked a few times,"After using the snow blower four or five times, it wouldn't start. Because it was only a few weeks old, I took it to the authorized service center. The technician said the cylinder was scarred, which was consistent with the engine being used without oil in the gas.However, for the first batch of oil-gas mix, I used the oil supplied with the blower. The second (and current) batch was a different brand, but the technician said the mix indeed had oil in the gas. The machine always had a gas-oil mix. He said he would call Toro to see what they had to say, suggesting a total engine replacement. Great.What's more, the web site would not identify the serial number on the box.I am very disappointed with what typically is a brand name with a great reputation. I could not recommend this product for any reason."
5,small but powerful,"I LOVE this little machine! I didn't have a lot of storage space and was tired of killing my back shoveling. I was worried about it's ability to handle heavier snow. It clears light snow like a breeze, the heavier snow, I tackle in smaller portions, but it takes it and clears it. The first start was hard, I had to use the electric feature and play with the choke. It's a little touchy sometimes, but if you play with the choke, it starts up great. The pull start is easy to pull with light resistance. It basically self propels as it pulls itself through the snow. It's light enough that I can fold the handle, pick it up and put it in my trunk to go clear my folks drive too! I was concerned about the oil/gas mixing, but with the oil in the pre-measured bottles available, it took all of 2 minutes. (Add one bottle to one gallon gas and mix in the container). If you're looking for something that will do the job, is light, possible portable, this is it."
1,fine when it starts,"This snowblower is fine when its working however, parts fall off when in use and starting at the beginning of the new season is a dubious proposition. I have had it repaired but, now consider the cost of repairs exceed its value. I am looking for a different snowblower. My first snowblower was Toro's 1800 powercurve. It worked dependably but, it lacked weight (it's hollow wheels were a joke)and therefore lacked traction. I bought this model hoping for more power. I got the power; it just came with a temperamental personality."
3,Didn't fit,"Item was misleading and did not fit the vehicle. However, the seller did have a no charge return label and as soon as it showed up in the UPS system the refund was given quickly. This was very impressive and appreciated. Found out that this item is not made for my year vehicle."
5,Great Lens,I picked up this lens at the end of October and used it extensively in a trip to the Caribbean. I love wide angle photography and was not wanting to spend big bucks on a unit.I'm blown away by the quality of this lens. My photos all turned out fabulous. Is it as good as a pricier lens? Probably not but in my opinion it's very close in quality to lens priced 3 or 4 times higher.
4,"Good quality, Good performance","I own a portrait and telephoto lens for my camera. I purchased this wide angle for outdoor shots. I like the feel of it, it's solid and doesn't feel cheaply manufactured. The mount is a bit tight when twisting on/off but maybe will loosen with use. The image quality is good, but a little on the soft side. I use Aperture to post process pictures to my liking. I purchased this lens based on favorable reviews comparing it to the Canon wide angle and would do so again."
5,Superb,"This lens came highly recommended from a photographer friend of mine and I am very pleased to say it does not disappoint. I used to own the Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8, and whilst this was an excellent lens, particularly in lower light conditions, I find the Sigma up to the challenge. I also find it sturdier with a more precise AF function. Very little vignetting even at 10mm, and the sharpness of the picture with my D300s is excellent. Finances prevented me from going for the more expensive f/ version, but I'm still happy.Highly recommended."
2,Warning for Nikon owners,"I received this lens recently and tested it in the back yard and found it to be acceptably sharp in all corners. What I find unacceptable is that there is no MF/AF switch on the lens. According to the manual this is only for the Nikon-mount version of this lens. The manual suggests that you use the AF/MF switch on your camera body to turn the lens to manual focus, but at least some (possibly all) of the more recent Nikon APS-C cameras (including mine, a D3100) do not have this switch. This makes the lens almost unusable for someone who wants to set the focus, reframe the camera on a tripod, and take a photo. It also prevents me from shooting more than one photo at a time without loosening my ball head, autofocusing again, holding down the shutter while repositioning my camera again and then shooting another frame. Needless to say this makes shooting with this lens very impractical. It does look like the Sigma 10-20 3.5 has the switch, so that may be the direction to go."
5,Excellent Ultra Wide (and Canon Substitute),"This is the best lens I own, also my favorite. It's built like a tank, has super quiet (and fast) HSM focusing, sharp as a tack, and several hundred dollars cheaper than the Canon 10-22mm.I have a Canon 30D and this lens was the best purchase I made for it. Composing shots can be tricky with such a wide field of view (you need to get really close in order to get an object in your foreground). The 10mm has some noticeable distortion, although it's fine for landscapes -- in fact, I think the distortion makes clouds look phenomenal.I wish it were f/4 throughout the zoom range (f/2.8 would be even better). This lens has an EF mount, so it will work on other Canon film and full-frame bodies (with some heavy vignetting).All in all, a great value. I'm very happy with my copy (pay no attention to the pixel peepers)."
5,"Better sharpness, brightness and color saturation than Canon's 10-22","I just did some test shots comparing the Sigma 10-20mm and the Canon 10-22mm. The Sigma beat the Canon hands down on sharpness, brightness and color saturation without question. I've owned the Canon 10-22mm for almost a year and have never been satisfied with the softness of the images it produces. I've even sent it to the factory 3 times for adjustment. The tests I did today show the Sigma to be surprisingly the better lens hands down. It may be that I purchased a bad Canon lens, but after 3 trips to the factory for adjustment, I would think it would have been spotted. I'm constantly being told by reps how good the Canon 10-22mm is as it has the super UD glass and is supposed to be similar to L series quality. I've never seen this on my 40D and I'm now ecstatic to have found the Sigma to replace it. This is a great lens for a very nice price."
1,returned,"I returned the lens today. Tried it extensively on a Rebel XSi. Maybe I had one of the bad copies. The sharpness was barely acceptable in the center. The corner sharpness was terrible. The images from the ""cheap"" 18-55 IS kit lens included with the XSi blow the ones taken with the Sigma flat out of the water. I will not take the chance and get another. Too much hassle and frustration. In my opinion it is not acceptable for a company like Sigma to have such sloppy quality control."
2,"Solid, but Fuzzy","I have taken nearly one thousand pictures with this camera, anything from architecture to nature. While my initial assessment of the camera was good, after having it for some time, I feel that the fuzziness of the pictures is unacceptable. I guess I felt as though it was my initial settings, or maybe becuase of the wide angle of the lens this was something that was par for the course. I have since read about softness on right or left side with this leans, but my experience is clarity is no good accross the entire frame, in EVERY situation. I will either send back for repair or get rid of it for the cannon 10-22 lens."
1,bad......bad sharpness.......,"I used this lens for 1 week and took over a 200 photos in various shutter speed/aperture combinations; all of them turned out so-so to no good. The center sharpness is ok, but the sharpness and distortion of the image becomes unacceptable, starting about half-way to the image edge.I don't believe I received a bad copy of this lens as a previous reviewer had as I didn't find one side of the image to be better or worse than the other and the autofocus seemed to be on target."
4,"excellent lens, poor hanling by Amazon","The lens is excellent. It is very solid and takes great pictures. When I purchased this lens, the lens box came damaged, even with pen markings on it. I called Amazon and they told me they would exchange it, but it was going to take 5-7 days and I needed the lens for an activity in 2 days, so they decided not to send next day or blue and I now I have a box which is in bad shape in the event I want to sell the product in the future. I also send this compalint in writing and I got no response. I was really disappointed this time with them."
5,great value,"Bought this lens primarily for interior shooting ie, architectural interiors etc. but the more I have it on my camera the more uses Ifind for it. Great for some creative photography. The lens is solidand images are sharp."
3,I fell in love with the Canon 10-22mm,"I had high hopes of a good sigma copy but ordered the canon 10-22mm at the same time to compare. I swapped out the lenses taking pictures at the same scenes and noticed some significant basic differences in photo quality just looking at the photos side by side. That was all I needed to fall in love with the canon. Maybe I could have exchanged the sigma until I found a copy I liked, but I am too busy with the canon."
2,Try and try again!,"Looking for a wide angle and a friend of mine really liked her Sigma 10-20 saying it took sharp pics. So instead of investing in the Canon for alot more I ordered the Sigma. The first copy was extremely soft wide open and closed down. Sent it back for another copy which was alot better wide open but at about f11 on up it got softer and softer, not sharp at all at f32 which seems odd since you'd think wide open would have the issues. I exchanged this lens three times! The last three lens were all the same. Thinking somethings up or it's just typical for this lens, I called Sigma. They advised me to send in my Canon 50d with the lens and they would check it out. Seems there's firmware in the lens which may not be reading my camera correctly, or at least that's how I interpreted it. Haven't gotten it back yet, will let you know if there's any change. Just beware, check the lens out as soon as you get it."
2,save to buy a canon lens,"Got this lens as a birthday gift, but sadly had to return it as it did not meet my expectations. The zoom range is great (10-20mm), but I either received a bad copy or Sigma does not offer good quality. I shot about 50-60 exposures, and I can count on one hand the number of good pictures I got from this lens. It was slow to focus, it lacked sharpness. For indoor photos this lens will leave you very disappointed. For outdoor photos, you will need great lighting and non-moving subjects.The positives: Solid built."
2,After 3 weeks I ended up returning mine,"I used this lens for 3 weeks and took over a hundred photos in various shutter speed/aperture combinations; all of them turned out so-so to no good. The center sharpness is ok, but the sharpness and distortion of the image becomes unacceptable, starting about half-way to the image edge.I don't believe I received a bad copy of this lens as a previous reviewer had as I didn't find one side of the image to be better or worse than the other and the autofocus seemed to be on target.When purchasing a wide angle lens, for the most part, it's to capture more of a given scene. This additional part of the scene is of course found around the edges of the frame. Therefore, I sent this lens back and am in search of a better one.Note, the build quality seemed solid and the autofocus was snappy. If only the overall sharpness were better I would have kept it."
4,Loving this lens,"Excellent lens for the price! Sometimes it gets a little distortion at 10mm, but that is to be expected out of many lenses when working that wide. Build quality is solid, lens feels heavy in my hand, but I don't mind that because I know it's solid. I use this lens on my Nikon D40 and it meters and auto focuses perfectly. I do however recommend shooting in the range of f/8-13 to get the crispest shots. I'd definitely recommend one."
4,pleased with the len but..,"I am very happy with almost all aspects of the lens. The price is nice and was what got my attention. The lens is very well constructed and the saturation that the lens adds to the photos is very welcoming. It has better saturation than both of my nikkor lenses. The Sigma was not as sharp as the nikkor though. This is apparent when you are editing photos or magnifying the images. However, most of my photos are landscape and it is not a big deal. There are some photos though with people that I wish their features would be more defined. The lens I bought was for a Nikon D90. Overall I am happy, but if you are concern with a real sharp image at 50% magnification I would what to test the lens first. 8x10 prints look great! As for lens features. It has auto focus or manual focus. you can screw a polorizer or any other filter."
4,Affordable and Super Wide,"If you are considering buying the Sigma 10-20 Ultra Wide Angle, there are a few things you should know:* The Hyper Sonic Motor is fast and quiet, even on this big, heavy lens.* The image quality is very good and sharp from corner to corner, even when wide open.* Construction quality is quite nice. I personally like the rubberized coating and how smooth the focus ring is.* This lens is quite heavy, so be careful when you set it up on your tripod, so you don't tip it over.* The angle of view is amazingly wide, I mean, really, really wide, even considering that is is made for cropped sensor cameras.* This lens comes with a terrific, padded lens bag and a nice lens hood. Both are awesome.* The f/4-5.6 is not very good in low light situations. Better use a flash.Overall, I am super happy with it. It works great and the images I have taken, so far, are amazing. Looking forward to using it more."
4,Robust lens and good value....,"I don't typically buy non-Nikon products but this Sigma lens does the job well for the buck. I observed that the image is a bit soft and I tried a number of camera settings to improve the sharpness. Using the lens at a fixed aperture (e.g., f/16) made a slight improvement but required increasing the ISO number. The resulting images at this setting compared favorably to my NIKON 18mm-70mm telephoto lens at the 18 mm focal point. In the end, I chose to use a normal camera exposure setting and apply low level sharpening using my software."
2,"Okay, but not great.","First, I must complement the vendor for delivering very quickly. However, as far as the product itself goes, I was not too impressed. Overall, the picture quality was good, and probably even acceptable. But at the 10mm setting, the pictures were not sharp at all when compared to my standard lens (Canon 18-200). The end result came out sharper when I took two or three regular picures with the standard lens and stitched them together to get the same field of view as the wide angle. Perhaps I got one of the ""bad"" Sigma lenses that I've read about in the other reviews, but at this point I'm going to return the lens and get the Canon 10-22mm at some time in the future."
3,"Good for outdoors, bad for lower light","I used this for the last two weeks, and my biggest issue is the poor open aperture performace. F/4 is very soft and not too usable... I found I had to take it to f/11 or f/16 (sharpest) to get good results.Its nice that it gets super wide, but its just not usable wide open in low light handheld situations. I dont carry a tripod every where I go... if I did this lens would be good, but since I like to handhold I need to open it up to get decent shutter speeds, and that makes it very soft. I knew it wasnt the fastest thing in the world from its specs, but having to stop down to f/11 or 16 really makes shutter speeds much much too long in lower light (like indoors, musuem).Build quality is very nice, I like the size and heft... but dont expect to use a pop up flash with the large lens."
5,This lens works very well with Nikon D40 FYI,"The other descriptions and details apply directly to the D40. Works fine. I like mine, would buy it again"
4,"Awesome Landscape Lens - Careful with People, Though!","If you're shooting landscape, this lens is an absolute must have -- stick it on a tripod, set it at f/8 and you're golden. Auto-focus is fast and accurate and doesn't have an issue focusing on objects that are close up.That being said, when it comes to people, it's a little more problematic. Even at 16-17mm, you get distortion at the edges, so if you're shooting groups, they will be stretched/elongated. The good news is that, at 20mm, it's fairly unnoticeable. So, if you're shooting more formal pictures, rack the lens out to 20mm and move your body or tripod. If you're shooting something more action oriented like urban, extreme sports -- snowboarding/skateboarding, etc, then the distortion might actually add to the photos."
5,Wonderful lens,"I bought this for my husband for our two year wedding anniversary. He'd been looking at the more expensive Nikon version, and that just isn't in our budget at this time, but I wanted to get him something that I knew he'd use and love.He's very happy with the lens and the results I've seen are wonderful. While neither of us are anything close to professional photographers, as the average user who enjoys taking landscapes and scenery, this lens does the job beautifully and we're very satisfied with our purchase."
4,Great wide-angle.,"This is a magnificent lens. True it is a little bit fuzzy around the edges of the picture, but I tested a Canon and it did the same thing. I feel for HALF the price this is at least a much greater value than the Canon 10-22 I tested. It is a great little lens for the price. I am sure there is a better wide-angle out there but I know that I would tell anyone interested to get this Sigma over the Canon.I never use auto-focus (why I bought SLR in the first place) so I can't tell you if it does its job well or not. Working manual, however, it does an A job."
1,i love sigma but this lens SUCKSSSSSSS,"I got the sigma 10-20 first. It was defective with softness on left side. The replacement I got was soft on the left and the right side. I googled only to discover this was a known issue, but their still out there. If u want to take a chance and keep swapping, be my guest. But by the time your done returning, you'll probably be out of pocket in shippng charges.Sigma lens's are extremely good, i still swear by them. But this one may cost u a lot more than u think.I anted up and got the canon 10-22 and well, it's now glued to the body :)"
2,becarefull before buying it,"it is a nice well build lens takes very sharp pictures,downfall is silent wave technology is not silent very noisy!!!also they advertisethe lens as af/mf means it works with my nikon d5000 automatic focusing system,but there is no on or off switch between af/mf focusing the way they explain how to focus manually does not work at all!!thats why it gets 1 star,rest is quite good,recommend it but with a becarefull mark!!"
4,Great value for money.,"This lens is the only super wide zoom available for DX DSLRs.You get what you pay for, and a little more !"
4,Received the Japanese Version for Nikon-no switch for Auto/Manual Focus & plastic Mount,All pictures shown on Amazon featured the switch for auto/manual focus but I didn't receive what was shown. Mount for Nikon version was PLASTIC not Steel as shown. I will be returning this and will hope for a US version of the lense.Lense is fairly fast but does not perform well in moderate to low light conditions.
4,Nice lens for the price!,"I don't have anything new to add besides what's already in the reviews. I took this lens to Big Sur, CA for a weekend trip and it took some really nice photos (I'll post 1-2 in the customer images section). I'm quite happy with it."
4,Ultra-wide bargain,"A nice lens for landscapes and architecture, the Sigma is compact and light for an ultra wide, but still feels solidly constructed. The autofocus with HSM does hunt on occasion, but with landscapes this is usually not a major issue. It has a sharp focus with good color rendition. At 40% of the price of the Nikon 12-24mm, this lens is an excellent value."
2,Returned due to IQ,"I was hesitant to order this lens because of the mixed reviews related to image quality differences between various samples. However, there were also some folks who apparently received a good copy on their first attempt so I thought I might give this lens a chance for a spot in my kit.When I received my order, I was pleased with the look and feel of this lens, as it has a nice solid feel, smooth zoom and focus rings. However, I simply could not get any shots that were sharp. I mounted this lens on my D3100, on tripod, and tried all focal lengths and apertures. The lens didn't start getting close to sharp until 20mm, which kind of defeats the purpose of an ultra-wide.I returned the lens for a refund instead of an exchange, because I didn't want to get into a game of ""lens sample roulette"" as it appears many folks have had to do in order to finally get a good copy. I guess I'll save a little longer and go with the Nikon 10-24."
3,Final verdict to come,"I was a bit wary to purchase this lens given the multiple reviews citing issues with the sharpness of the lens and variability in the make. However I was impressed by the overall user satisfaction and made the purchase. My lens arrived yesterday and I have taken it for a test run both indoors and outdoors, and am disappointed to say that it seems I have received a defective copy of the lens. I tested apertures all the way from 4 to 16, with both auto and manual focus, and even the objects within the focus point were blurry. I also compared identical shots to my original Nikon 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S and shot for shot, the Nikon was sharper throughout.I am sending the lens for a replacement and will update this review when it arrives. Hope it turns out better!!"
2,I got a bad copy.,Unfortunatley I received a bad copy of this lens. It was generally soft across the board with the upper left hand quadrant being extremely out of focus. I also did not like the distortion I was getting at 10mm.....it really was not good for architectural photography and I could not fix it in Lightroom. I am sending this back for a refund and spending the extra money for the Pentax 12-24 mm lens.
4,A bit soft on the left side,The build quality is good and it focuses fast. It's a fun lens to shoot with. I'm happy with the center sharpness but my only gripe is that under certain conditions the photos turn out noticeably soft on the left side.
4,A little soft,Sometimes I am really pleased with the bright color repro and it generally produces sharp images. But I'm going to wait and see before I render an updated verdict. I ran a lot of sharpness test images:at 10mm f/8 was bestat 13mm f/5.6-f/11at 17mm f/11 and most all was very goodat 20mm f8-f/11
5,Excellent lens for a good price!,"I use this lens primarily with my Canon 40D & I'm well pleased with it's performance. This is my only non-Canon lens & it's very comparable in build & optical quality. This is a good looking lens & most importantly, the optical quality is very good. Fast, quiet AF & very versatile. I would recommend this lens to anyone looking for a wide angle zoom at a reasonable price."
5,very good one,i bought this lens a month ago..and it's been of very good use to me.very good and compact ...nice desgin and TEXTURE to the lens itself.I would certainly recommend it
4,Best Value Ultra Wide Angle Lens,"This lens has excellent build quality, which is expected for a Sigma EX lens. The USM motor makes auto focus fast and quiet. The image is very sharp. The only thing that prevents me from giving it five stars is its pronounced distortion at the 10-12mm range. So this lens is great for landscape but not for architectures."
1,Not sharp!,"Was optimistic that despite other reviews about having to exchange the lens due to sharpness and that a friend of mine has a very sharp copy, I went ahead and ordered it. My first lens was extremely blurry closed down and wide open. I got a second one to find it was reasonably sharp wide open but once again blurry from f11 on up. Tried for a third one and was told by Amazon you can only return twice. Waited for my refund and I am trying again only because I know it is possible to get a good one, it's way cheaper than a Canon and hoping it's worth the pain in the ....."
3,Im half disapoinetd with this one,"When i recieved this lens i was half disapoined because is wasnt with the (HSM) option , and it doesnt the same on that shown on the photo , i dont know whos fault it was ? when i read the discreption on the amazon it tells that this lens is with ( HSM ) option , and i send an e-mail to the amazon and i told them about the problem that this product i recieved is less option than the one i ordered , and they ask me to send it back , but since i already have it between my hands i decided to keep it , there is not too much differant between the one with the (HSM) option and the one i recieved , the ( HSM ) lens work without noise , but the one i recieved make a littel noise ."
2,"just bad...not terrible, but just bad.","ive heard worse, being the reasoning for two stars. these guys arn't really worth writing a long review about, so i'll just give you my quick two cents that I don't like these guys. I know alot of people that do though, but his voice is just so dull and it's like everything else out there, I just don't like it. One way to know that you've made it in music is that a bunch of people can't stand your music. So i guess, congrats to Rufio??"
2,Nothing special,"This novel was an OK read, but nothing special. The story was somewhat interesting just because of the setting in Wales, and you want to find out what happens, but I couldn't identify with the characters at all. The awkward attempts at Welsh dialect were also a bit distracting."
2,Author doesn't deliver on a promising story line,"I liked the plot summary I'd read and the fact that it was based on a true story. Leiner's story describes an area I love and know well, so I was looking forward to that aspect. The attractive cover of the book appealed as well, and included praise on the back cover. So when I eagerly dove into this book, I was fully expecting to love it. Not by a long shot! I found her writing cliched and self-conscious. The text had grammatical and other errors that were distracting and unprofessional. The book has the hook of an interesting story line, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars, but it's poorly executed and needs an editor. It made me wonder whether Leiner's writing strengths perhaps lie in her other areas of nonfiction and children's fiction, because this debut adult novel was a big disappointment for me."
2,Nothing major,"I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this novel. Unless you've had the exact same tragic events happen to you, there is no way of relating to the characters."
1,La Fidelite: all region :Sold by: archlutenist,Bad picture quality not to DVD standards.Seems like half of my Available from these sellers purchases turn out this way.
4,A great book even if you don't aspire to be a writer,"This book is a collection of monthly columns that Block had written for a writing magazine. They fit perfectly together to make a book that is easy to recommend to anyone who treasures books, especially fiction.I loved this book, even though I am more of a reader than a writer. You will learn techniques that an actual writer uses when devising plots, character names, and even titles. Don't expect a cookie-cutter approach to producing a story. Block instead gives you many chapters that are filled with actual examples of work written not only by himself but by other writers. The discussions that accompany these examples are both educational, easily read, and highly entertaining.I believe the book has made me a much better reader. I can now often sit back and understand just why I didn't like a particular book."
2,"Content OK, Reprint Edition Horrid !","Don't waste your money on this reprint edition. It is printed on poor paper, the type has been reduced in size, the typesetting thus compacts and makes it difficult to read, and the ink has blurred.I had borrowed an earlier paper edition and thought that was what this is. Not so. Buy an earlier paperback edition if Block is your mentor. I wouldn't buy it again. Perhaps that's why there are so many ""used"" copies available everywhere. Books are written to be read; this particular printing was printed to be sold. They should have left well enough alone.By the way, I'm not a beginner. I've been writing and published in numerous venues for 42 years."
1,"not fun at all, and shouldn't be profitable","I returned my copy immediately. I don't think I've seen a printing job this bad for an item you actually pay money for. The ink bleeds all over the paper, the type is very dark (almost like bold) but spaced very close, and you can see the printing on the back of the page. Ever print on an inkjet printer on crappy cheap paper? That's what it looks like. I posted some photos to give you an idea."
5,My Bible,"This book was my bible for many, many years. When aspiring authors ask me what's the best book on writing out there, this is the one I recommend first. It's a collection of Mr. Block's Writer's Digest columns and they are just as relevant today as they were when they were first published. Anyone serious about writing fiction should read this book."
3,inspirational,"It's a pretty cute, entertaining audio-book. While it does contains seeds of practical advice, it seemed to be more inspirational and encouraging to me than anything else. A nice listen for when you are tired of writing and want to know you are not alone."
4,Another Block Blockbuster,"There are a gazillion books out there on writing, but as usual Lawrence Block is ahead of the game. Excellent book should be in every writer's library. Karleene Morrow, author of Destinies, a novel."
3,Good but--,"Block is a good writer, excellent in fact. This is a good resource, but I've read better. The gist of content, is study the market, and write steady until you are finished."
4,"Nice seat pad, but a little tight","I made it work, but it was really a tight fit over my seat (which is exactly 15 inches). Once I got it on, it ok, but you can still see how 'short' it is on covering the top appropriately. They really should advertise this as a 14 inch seat cover."
2,Hate it.,"I do not like this item. It is more than appropriate for a 10 year old. I like the fact that it had a soduku game in it, but, you can not use the stylo with it! The organizer is ok, but I mainly needed an organizer for my work and college schedules, and I had to put them in as appointments because the only options were ""Appointments"" and ""To Do Tasks."" It seems a little odd to me. I would never have paid $29.99 for it. It is only worth like $10. I returned mine. My advice is not to buy it."
3,THE BEST PDA EVER!...well...next to the palm pdas,"This thing is the closest thing you can get to a basic pocket pc. Pros:its got something like a 11mhz cpu.it can hold N E THING on note,todo and phone.cons:alarm sound is SO WEAK my dog cant even hear it. the nav is akward i mean can they have done a normal up down left right gameboy style?.it needs to be reset every 5 secends."
4,"OK, but not the best","I thought that this book was not as good as Without Feathers or Getting Even. Certain points are funny, even hilarious. However, there are largely unfunny passages such as ""Retribution"". However, there are a few good vignettes, most notably ""Confessions of a Burglar"" and ""Nefarious Times We Live In"". If you've already read his other books, this still has some laughs; if not, I recommend his two previous selections."
1,terrible.,"this book is a chore to read. i kept at it, hoping it would improve, but it continues in the same unfunny vein throughout. the unrelentingly 'wacky' style is ridiculous, but not in an interesting way."
3,Could be better,"1. Should include a list that tells readers the original Chinese titles, names, nouns of works, authors, concepts discussed but doesn't. This the most annoying issue.2. Quality of translation uneven.3. Doesn't include political-oriented works.4. Introduction and notes extremely insufficient.5. It took Norton five tomes (World Masterpieces, English Lit 1 & 2, and American Lit 1 & 2) to include the important works for Anglo-Saxon lit, but one for Chinese lit? We need more people to help Owen and the study of Chinese lit in general."
1,big drag,"""big book, big drag"" quipped callimachus some two millenia ago. Though I don't always share his dislike of literary largeness, in this case his words ring cruelly trueThe quality of the translations is overall quite poor. That is, one can't tell what is being said. The footnotes don't clear things up, and the introductory notes are often as not simply fatuous. Cyril Branch's anthology from Columbia, though not great, is worlds better than this shoddy magnum opus."
2,"Sorry, no","This is quite simply one of the sappiest, self-serving collections of poetry to be published in the past 5 years or so in America. It is AWFUL."
2,Weak and Vapid,"Why is this constant self obssessed literature still being wriiten? If Nick Flynn had any talent as a writer instead of as a whiner about his own personal loss, this MIGHT be interesting. This is not interesting."
1,Guess What?,"this book bites. sorry to say it so bluntly, but someone's got to drum it into this generation's head that their self-consumed literature of loss and want and nothing else is as vapid ether."
1,almost 2 stars!,"If my mother died, well who knows? Maybe I too would make light of her life adn suicide with similiarly trite poems. I'd like tot hink though that young writers know better than this, that such cliche subjects need to be at least treated in interesting ways. Nick Flynn's disappointing first book is one I wish I could return."
2,Hilariously Bad,Actually I'm more amused by the comments of some of these readers than I am by the poetry itself. The work is cliche. And since it's cliche I don't think it warrants any further exposition that this.
2,old fashioned and out of place,"i read this book. i thought it was self-centered and boring and does nothing with the form. these are pretty poems about bad things. a silly, old-fashioned form that's been done very much more interestingly by others..."
4,Helps outsiders understand,"One of the core frameworks of modern Japan has been its library system. Acting as an adjunct to an impressive and intensive education system.To non-Japanese who do not speak the language, it can be difficult to understand and appreciate the extensive and indeed pervasive nature of libraries throughout their society. Welch does us the favour of illuminating this. He gives a comprehensive description of the different types of libraries, at various educational levels and regions. He also puts this in the context of the traditions of pre-Meiji Japan.A very coherent presentation."
3,I found this book to be interesting because of the theories,this book was a fun read for me because I love history. I wanted to learn more on the research done by Fred Bean. He offered up some interesting ideas about what was really going on in Mexico.
2,An account from a Texas cowboy that served the army as scout,This story gives a good prespective of the difficulties encountered in the U.S. Army pursuit of Pancho Villa . It supports the theory that Villa didn't attack Columbus N.M. but took credit for the action . Many of the deeds of the cowboy scout are hard to beleive . Overall this book is worth reading for it's unusual prespective .
5,Great for my 6 year old,"Bought several of these books for my 6 year old, and he's flying through them voraciously. He loves to read, loves Clifford, so it was a perfect match."
1,Clifford and the Big Storm,I was not happy with the condition of the book. The front cover was bent in half. I would not recommend this vendor to anyone.
1,Yawn. Yanni. Yo-Yo Ma. New Age Garbage.,"Almost fell asleep during the first -- and every subsequent -- track on this unendingly boring album. No tempo changes, every song mid-tempo, undecipherable lyrics, cliched melodies -- it's all here, folks, and it's all just a big old honkin' sonic BLATT. B-o-r-i-n-g. Fans of ""Gaucho""-era Steely Dan and fans of England Dan and John Ford Coley *might* -- MIGHT -- find this collection of indistinguishible vagely entertaining.I, however didn't.I resent the fact that I will never get those 50 minutes of my life back -- what a waste."
4,"""classic"" Koontz","I have only been reading DK for about three year now. So I am more familiar with his newer work. I have been trying to read the old stuff and this was pretty good, for the most part ""classic"" Koontz."
4,A Fun Read!,"I really enjoyed this book, though others seem to have found it a little 'classic horror movie' -ish, I thought it was a really fun read. It has LOTS of detail and pulls you into feeling like you're there with the characters. It does follow more of a movie-script lay-out, but that just makes you wonder all the more what the evil is that's behind everything. The movie they made of this doesn't parallel the book at all (what else is new?) so don't base your opinion on that. Overall, a fun, really creepy, grissly horror! I recommend!"
4,One of Koontz's better offerings,"This SF/horror hybrid was first published in 1983, but it still holds up well. It mixes suspense with gore quite effectively, and the characters are vivid and memorable. Once the identity of the ""Ancient Enemy"" is revealed -- imagine ""The Blob"" as a Satanic being -- things get a little over-the-top, with Koontz throwing supernatural curve balls a bit too freely ... but the story holds your interest and you do care about the protagonists. Not a great work of literature, but a good read!"
3,TO DRAWN OUT,I loved the begging of this book but after I while I noticed that people started to repeat themselves and it started to get to repetative for my tastes. I would say see the movie but the movie was just as bad actually it was worst. Still this book was OK and I think you need patience to get all the way through.
4,good but to much sexual remakes about women,I liked the bood a lot and i am going to read more of them.The science part was very good. how he said the myth of Satan got started with the shape changer. He also used some history about mass dissapears that was very good
4,"Phantoms, another classic",If you like a book you can't put down. I highly recommend this book. It's got everything you want in a good weekend read.
2,i think it was one of his worst,"the beginning of this year i read phantoms because at the time i was interseted in watching the movie. i am a fan of mr. koontz's work and was rather disappointed in this book. i felt that it's plot was rather hard to follow and that the characters seemed, and acted, extremely vulnerable in the conditions that they faced throughout the book. i feel that this didn't have the suspense that intensity and the face of fear had. and to me he's a sucessful writer but had a flop with this one."
5,Awesome selection,This book will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. You won't want to put it down until you have finished even if it means pushing everything else aside. Koontz will keep you in suspense and excited the entire book.
3,would've gotten five if i didn't compare it 2 one other book,"Good, but not great. The characters are as cliche as the come, but the reason for the disseapearances, (spelled that wrong) is cool. But Stephen King's IT blows this book away. I'm only 14 but i can tell IT is better, with a much better nemesis and better characters. Phantoms is suspensful and mysterious, but pretty tame compared to IT'sPennywise"
3,Good but a little predictable.,"I have to admit that if you want a fluff thriller page turner this is the one. While the set up is really intriguing and you are fascinated by the unknown elements, the final conclusion and sub-plot are a bit disappointing. Perhaps it is the same effect that Star Wars has on little kids...been there done that. By the third act, you know who lives and dies before it's over and the final conclusion is a bit disappointing. . The thing that makes this a great read is the build up and the mystery behind the strange occurances."
3,The first half is better than the second,"In the first half Dean Koontz is at his best, delivering a creepy story about a band of people being terrorized by a ""supernatural"" force. But similar to some of Koontz's other works, the man becomes bored with his own story and progress grinds to a halt as the reader trudges through unnessecary scenes and descriptions that have either been repeated a dozen times before or are completely irrelevant. When we find out that the monster isn't supernatural but rather a highly-evolved organism, the story goes from highly original horror to B-grade sci-fi. The downgrade is unfortunate because the first half is fiction at its best."
3,"A good read, but not my favourite","I did enjoy ""Phantoms"".... just not as much as I had hoped to. I do enjoy Dean Koontz but I guess I felt as though this departed a bit from the themes which I normally enjoy reading from him (""Veolocity"" and ""Sole Survivor"" recent examples). The story did maintain a level of suspense the whole way through with a few big unanswered questions which nagged me thoroughly all the way through until the end (in a good way). There were times when I felt that things were dragging.... other times when I felt like certain plot points were just filler. But over-all a good story and I'm not unhappy that I read it. It was enjoyable and I did leave the book especially intrigued about the mass dissapearances upon which it is based. I think Mr. Koontz did a nice job using historical occurances to create a story of fiction. It was just a little too much at times, and not quite enough at others. But again, I don't regret the read. I just didn't love it as much as I had hoped to."
4,Recommended Read,"I am not the biggest Koontz fan (more of a Stephen King fan), but I really enjoyed Phantoms. Very creepy and suspenseful. There were a couple slow parts, but it was a solid story for the most part. I'd recommend reading this for both Koontz and King fans."
4,Good Koontz Monster Story,"This is one of Dean Koontz's better 80's books. It occurs in the town of Snowfield, CA. Jenny and her sister Lisa return to the town to find it is full of dead locals, and the monster story thus ensues. A bit dated when it refers to the technical side of the computer stuff, but the suspense and horror are well written and frightening. Has a few of your standard Koontz twists and turns, but still an enjoyable read."
4,Very good! Some problems...,"I'd have given this great supernatural thriller five stars if it weren't for the numerous instances of inconsistancies and plain ignorance. A problem I noticed immediately is the author's apparent ignorance of firearms. He makes reference to a .38 AUTOMATIC, a .45 revolver (NOT Long Colt, a police officers weapon) and one weapon even changes from an automatic 9mm to a revolver in 2 pages. The behavior of police is also amateurish. Six officers respond to an empty city, discover it is indeed full of the mysterious dead and instead of immdiately retreating and calling 'reinforcements' continue exploring WITH civilians in tow. They also seem to be unable to communicate via radio with each other. An author as prolific and successful as Koontz should be above such mistakes.Still, it's a great book and I highly recommend it. I'm just picky, especially as regards firearms and police procedure."
1,Stopped Early,"I stopped reading when the author did the math for a gun. 3 rounds had been fired and that left 7 rounds in the magazine of the revolver. Revolvers do not have magazines and they hold 6 rounds. I don't expect the author to be a gun expert, but basic knowledge/fact checking would be nice."
2,Disappointing,"I normally love Koontz and was excited for this book. It started with a bang and captured my attention immediately. I thought it would be a real adventure but instead became a huge let down. Even after the characters learn that they're not dealing with any ordinary men or terrorists that can be terminated with guns, they still proclaim ""don't go in there without a gun!"" Really! Wait, you already know it can't be killed with a gun. . . .so why . . . .. Fighting the monster/ Ancient Enemy became almost comical at the end. So unbelievable that it was not suspenseful or thrilling at all. Big disappointment."
5,Scary!,"This is a story about a woman who takes her younger sister to visit her in her small, picturesque town. When they arrive the streets are silent and not a soul is in sight. Soon they find dead bodies. Who or what caused the death of every individual in the town? This story is similar to Michael Chricton's Outbreak, only with a supernatural twist. There are plenty of scares and interesting plot twists. This is a great Koontz book."
4,500 bodie bags?,"I just read Dean Koontz's book, Phantoms. From the first page it catches you attention then holds it TO THE LAST PAGE! On the first page, you are taken to a small out-of-the-way town in northern California, called Snowfield. Here, Jenny Paige, the doctor, goes home to find her house keeper...Dead. a sheriff from a close town, there to help, calls for backup, and asks for 500 bodie bags. Dean Koontz is the author of many best selling books, I like his writing because he describes the setting, people, weather, mood, and whatever else, SO WELL. i recommend Dean Koontz's Phantoms to any one who wants to read a real page turner."
3,A solid effort.,"Don't get me wrong: I'm a huge Dean Koontz fan. But this relatively early effort, despite being imaginative and scary, felt a bit rote to me. The story itself was clever and inventive, but some of the characters just weren't up to par. There's the requisite nasty guy who's one of the first to go (isn't it always that way?), the old-timer who's been on the force for years, the sensitive soul...they just weren't believable to me, and that tarnished some of the book's credibility. It's a worthwhile book with a very interesting premise (Koontz's explanation for mass disappearances is truly frightening), but this extremely prolific author has much better books to offer. If you want an example of his best work, try ""Watchers"" (my personal favorite, and one of my favorite books of all time) or ""Dark Rivers of the Heart"". Overall, ""Phantoms"" is a worthwhile read, but don't expect too much in terms of characters."
2,Koontz was hyped as King's sole competition for so long...,"But I don't understand why after reading this book. I saw flashes of Koontz as a contender with this story, but in the end the book limped along on half-drawn characters and stilted dialogue. Koontz came up with a grand slam premise, and it was the strength of the premise that dragged me across the finish line. Without that I'm not so sure I would've made it.The characters aren't all badly drawn, but none of them really feel complete. The dialogue is at times atrocious, at others simply frigid. As a case in point, I have not forgotten--nor will I ever forget--the preposterousness with which one of the characters described the monster in detail AS HE'S BEING EATEN. I almost took off my running shoes at that point. Almost.Koontz can write well when he puts his mind to it. But Phantoms proves too stiff and underdeveloped to truly showcase his talent. Pick up Intensity instead."
2,Give it a rest!,"Well, first off it's not a bad story and it is a page turner. But...it's been done sooooo many times before and since! Shape changing monsters that can look like anything they want. Oh, and don't forget the tentacles. Why can't these writers (both books and movies) write about a ""normal"" monster, or alien, or whatever that CANNOT make itself look like a human? And why does every life form in these types of stories have to have tentacles? I'm still waiting for that great story where these themes are dropped. Please just give it a rest!"
2,"a great beginning, but nothing then on.","I had high hopes from the description in the book's jacket, but after a riveting beginning the reveal of the ""villain"" left me astonished and quite disappointed. The rest of the book was cheesy, bordering on humorous and just not up to Koontz standard. Find a different one."
3,Great book... terrible narrator,"I love Dean Koontz and always have, and while this is a great book the narration is TERRIBLE. I'm not sure why they'd choose a narrator that has a lisp, but they did. So now I can't concentrate on the story, because I'm too busy listening to the narrator lisp. I'd recommend reading this book as opposed to listening to it!"
4,Only My Third Koontz Novel,"This one was pretty good, but I actually liked the build-up of the first half better than the action towards the end. The idea of the ancient enemy was pretty neat, but I expected a little more from this one due to its high praise. I only gave it four stars because I enjoyed Intensity & Lightning more than Phantoms. Still worth the read though and here is hoping that the Dean Koontz novel I just started, Life Expectancy, will be worth it as well."
2,Pretty much a waste of time,"The first 40 pages of this book were great. I had to get up and lock my door and turn on all the lights. That is the only reason I give the book 2 stars. It could have kept up the scary and intense pace but after the first 40 pages it was executed so poorly. I hope i have the energy to try one more Koontz book. This was my first one, and it gave me a very bad impression. Anyone have any suggestions for my next try? Feel free to email me."
2,not good,"I am a Peter O'Toole fan, so in preparation for seeing his latest movie PHANTOMS from this book, I read the book before seeing the movie. I'm glad I read the book first, because that way I knew in advance that the movie would probably be lousy, too. And it was lousy. The only good things in it were Peter O'Toole and Rose McGowan. PHANTOMS is the type book that should give hope to aspiring untalented horror writers everywhere that they too can become best selling novelists. The only thing preventing me from giving the book one star is that the writing itself was actually pretty good. But the writing told an inept tale."
2,A missed opportunity,"This book shows both what I love and hate about Koontz. Great premises, but crappy endings.For the first 70 pages or so he had me hooked. A town suddenly empty of people; Marie Celeste like food still hot on the stoves. A woman and her young sister, alone, with ""something"" creeping around. So far, so creepy, and I was loving it.I was still with him when the cops turned up... but when the ""creature"" turned out to be a huge, almost omnipotent amoeba, he lost me. I stuck with it through to the end, but I had ceased to care about what happened to the characters by then.A missed opportunity. It could have been so much better."
2,Generic horror.,"Stock characters and monsters fill this story of a town that has suffered a mysterious and complete disappearance of all it's inhabitants. The first half or so builds up interest, but the rest is by the numbers. Worse is Koontz' tedious writing style, the way he has to not only explicitly spell out every last detail of what is happening (either in action or in the characters' thoughts), but he has to then beat the concepts into the readers' heads. PHANTOMS might be okay beach or travel reading, but I can't recommend it any other way at all."
3,"Now darkness has form, and devours body and soul.","I like suspense, and this book is full of it. I do not appreciate, however, gratuitous sexual writing, which seems to be vintage Koontz, at least in his earliest writing. That is why I only give this book 3 stars. However, it is a psychological roller coaster, and the thrills don't end till the last page. It is a good, fast read for those that like an action-packed yet intelligent plot. Highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, by any means."
3,Grotesque and suspenseful,"I liked the first half much better than the second. The build up was so good its hard to be impressed by the reveal of whats causing all the horror. Sorta reads like a movie, with decent characters, sets, mysterious murders etc. If you combined Poltergeist with a slasher movie and then throw in the typical old style Star Trek god-like evil being, you get an idea what this is all about. I usually prefer less explanation to more when describing suppernatural or novel beings, but the description was at least clever.There are scenes of extreme gore, so be wary.Spoiler: doesnt it take hours if not days for bacterium to do their thing, eat and replicate on a large scale? I would think that simply using soap/detergent would have been far more devastating to an oil based creature, especially one with no bones. Horror and sci-fi rarely get the science correct. Not a deal breaker just annoying. The ending went on for quite a while, and a little too cliche for me."
4,Kindle Version,"Liked:I'm a big Koontz fan and, while this is no longer my absolute favorite, it is one of the ones that got me hooked on his writing.It's an excellent story with a great, original plot. It is horror for the discerning reader.Disliked:In the Kindle version, there are triple spaces between every paragraph. Very annoying, especially as there were the same spaces between every paragraph, even when it was supposed to denote a scene change.Overall: I only dropped a star because I am reviewing the Kindle version. The paper version would get 5 stars."
3,"Could've been 4 stars, but...","This is the 4th Koontz book I've read, and I think it is the best Koontz book I've read yet. The monster was very far-fetched, but I liked the characters and much of the story."
4,Not a bad light for the price,"If you need something quiet, look elsewhere, the fan in this thing is pretty loud. Other than that, I had great PAR values coming from this light with ATI and Geissman bulbs in it. Grew out all types of corals, but probably not as fast as they could have."
4,Definately a classic,"Not only was this a great story, it also addressed an issue that should be in the mind of ALL scientists at the cutting edge of research - just because we can, doesn't mean we should.Initially I thought that the pace of the story was a little fast, and wondered what the remainder of the book was going to be about. However, I shouldn't have been concerned, as Keyes steered it away from the initial direction to one which reminded me (somewhat abstractly) of Luke Rhinehart.This is good, solid sci-fi which deserves it's place in this SF Masterworks series"
4,A touching story!,""" Flowers for Algernon"" , written by Daniel Keys is a fascinating book you can't miss! It reflects a story of a retarded grown up man who is chosen for an operation that can change his life and all the other retarded people. I think the author of this book transmits sensations that get into your heart. While reading this book I could imagine every situation and that, was probably, what made me love the book. I think this is a book out of the ordinary and the way it is decribed makes you feel like the main chararacter, Charlie Gordon. I hardly recommend this book to all of you! After reading it you will keep thinking of everything that happened."
4,Flowers For Algernon,"When I read Charlie I thought it was going to be a bad book, I thought I thought it was going to be about a guy that had mental problems. But instead it was a very interesting book about human feelings and human nature; it showed all that he had to become smarter. It was fascinating, because all of the different things he suffers to become intelligent. I think it that is very impressive how a human being has this obsession and tries to overcome it. It is fascinating and impressive. Even though it is a fiction book it is very realistic and human, and shows both sides of the human nature, (when he was retarded, and when he was smart). I really liked this book and I really recommended to anyone that wants to have a good read."
4,Through The Years,"I am long since out of Junoir HighSchool at the age of thirty-eight. I recall this reading nearly in it's entirety. I feel it ashamed that schools don't seem to be pushing reading as they did when I was a young lad. Thank goodness I have a daughter who loves to read. She is only twelve and reads anything she can get her hands on. I am Buying this book once again after all these years for her reading pleasure. Yes, this book will bring tears and joy. I believe this book will inspire any young mind or parent who wants to know what kids miss out on in reading now-a-days!. Enjoy."
5,"My favorite story, now for Kindle",I try to read this book at least once a year. My favorite book. Go read it. I think you'll like it.
3,Flowers for Algernon - VR,"This story was deeply touching and extremely emotional. It impacted me very much because i felt so involved in the story that when all the bad things started happening, i felt very sad myself."
3,"interesting premise for a story, makes for a so-so read","this book is about a young mentally handicapped man, charlie gordon, who opts to have an experimental surgery to `make him smart'. algernon is the mouse that shows successful results, and with high expectations, charlie develops quickly into a genius. written from a journal perspective, we can see the mental and emotional changes that charlie undergoes. a touching story, with a clean and simple writing style.i mostly liked the story line and character development, although the midpoint of the book made me feel like the author was reaching beyond his own intellectual means and it sounded forced, at times.definitely worth reading, but it didn't blow me away."
5,Still one of my favorite books,"I had to read this book for class in high school, but now (college and graduate school later) I still enjoy it. It's one of my favorite books. Beautifully written, and the TV movie on CBS last night did not begin to do it justice. Trust me, this will be one of your better ""darn I have to do it for school"" books."
4,"Fascinating, amazing, touching!","A fascinating novel that matains you entertained troughout the whole book, when you read one sentence you want to know what's on the next one. It talks about a retarded man that the only thing he wnats is to become smart so people can like him. He gets what he wants(advanced technology), but he realizes that it wasn't what he expected. Things happened to him... fell in love, found his family and many more! I really liked this book, it's one of the best ones I've ever read. It's one book that I enjoyed rerading, and I really got into it. It's a master piece!"
4,A page turner,This book was definitely a page turner and I was glad I read it. Keyes wrote an engaging story that was hard to put down. I'm not giving it five stars because I thought it lacked something - I guess I felt the author was trying to send a message and I wasn't really buying it. Charlie caused his own loneliness and unhappiness. It had very little to do with him becoming intelligent. Someone like Dostoyevsky could have taken the same story and done so much more with it. That may be an unfair comparison though. Flowers is definitely worth reading.
5,A devisatingly realistic story of never-changing fate,"Charlie Gordon, the main character who is mentally challenged, undergoes surgery to make him smart. This surgery is an experiment for doctors learn about the effects of this process. They had already performed this test on a mouse named Algernon. The thirty-two year old is really excited about the test. As the book goes on you realize how much the surgery affected him and the drastic changes and damage it did to his personality. Unfortunately, at the end of the book you find out that the surgery wasn't as helpful as the doctors had hoped. This proves that fate can never really be changed, even by Science."
3,A pleasing and intellectual novel,"It is a well written novel but ultimately, I found it frustrating to read. It ia written in journal form, supposedly written by a very dim-witted fellow so the grammar, spelling and punctuation drove me up a wall at first. The errors were hard for me to over-look and although they were necessary (and all of that is superficial anyway), I found myself attacking the page with a red pen. The story is wonderful and everyone else who's read it that I talk to says it's incredibly emotional (I did not find it so, but who am I to argue with the masses?) It is recommended for it's morals and story but not the style or writing itself."
2,This is about an operation that changed someone's life.,"personally i didn't like this book very much, it is about a retarded person who goes through an operation and realizes people have been making fun of him his whole life. It is completely unbelivable and it shouldn't be written in journal entries, it makes everything more confusing. But the overall idea of the story was good. It is definitely an adult's book."
2,I didn't really like this book...,I didn't really liked Flowers for Algernon... it wasn't the best book I have ever read. I read it in 8th grade for school. I found the events hard to follow because there were so many. Plus the book never seemed to be going anywhere. I reccomend this book if your patient.
3,Book iz based on my tru story!,They awthor caled the man Charly but meye reel name is Steve. The mawse was named Bertha i dont no why the awthor changd that two. one time i peed in my pants.
2,Didn't float my boat,"Flowers for Algernon provided entertainment in the biggining explaining his operation and sad stories, but I found that it was all downhill from there. I feel the book goes too in depth about Charlie's feelings on relationships. Not one of my favorites."
2,It was Alright,This book was alright. It wasnt the best.It is about a guy who is mentally challenged and get pick to try an experament to make him smarter(well and opperation). He had to take all these tests and mazes before they could do it to see if he was good enought to use. He was. After he got the opperation he thought it wasnt going to work because he thought he wasnt getting smarter. He really was getting smarter everyday. After he got the opperation he started doing more mazes and tests to see how it works. He kept getting smarter and smarter and remembering a lot of things. He could never remember anything. He remembered how they treated him in school and how the people at work treated him because he understands what they mean by all the things they said about him or to him. He never understood all them things before.
1,Flowers for Algernon,"I was very disappointed in the product quality of this book. Amazon stated this was a Hardcover Book. When I received the book, it is the size of a paperback. The print is very small!! And the cover is ""cardboard"" quality, it has no book jacket! Amazon should have been clearer on the type of book that this was.(I do love the story. - It is just the product.)"
5,Should be required reading.,"I am completely inadequate to review this book. It was way out of my comfort zone when I read it, but I just couldn't stop. It was wonderful. To be inside Charlie's head and experience his life; his old life, his new life and eventually his painful descent back to the old Charlie was just mind-blowing. This book raises so many ethical questions, everyone should read and discuss this book at least once."
5,This is the best book!!!!!!!!,I give this book 5 stars I read on my summer break. I loved it the plot was great it was the most wonderfuly written book I ever read I reccomend it to anyone
2,Ugh...,"This book is not actually as bad as everyone say it is. It's juts that SOOOOO many schools make this required reading, and only a small percentage of kids would actully find this book engaging.The plot is pretty cool, it's a very interesting thought: what if an operation could make you a genius? The format of the book; diary entries; is engaging also. However, the book goes into too much detal about pointless things...and that's why so many people don't like this book. It drags on and on, never getting very exciting.I love to read. I really do. I just don't like being forced to read horribly boring books by my english teacher."
2,not good,"When I first heard on Flowers for Algernon I thought it would be a great book that would make me cry. I was wrong. The book was good at the begging. It really made me feel sorry for the young Charlie. As I kept reading the book I realized that all Charlie thinks about is physical relationships. It would have been fine if just a few pages involved this, but that was what the whole book was about.All in all, not a good book."
1,A total waste of time.,"A total waste of time, not worth the reading time or any suggestion to any other person and this includes school."
1,Terrible!,"The publishing company should be ASHAMED of itself. This is one of the worst-edited books I've ever seen. Spelling and grammar mistakes on every page. I had to bail after 20 pages because I couldn't take it any more. WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO that this is allowed to be published???? I mean, fifty years ago, this would NEVER have been printed!"
1,This was one of the worst book that I ever read in my life,"I think this book related to real life. One is that Charlie Gordon has who a problem in that to improve his IQ,and he was looked down upon by people who belittle him because they think he is dumb. So he we went to Dr. Strauss for help which he got. Some of the reason that I did not like this book because in the middle of the book and in the beginning he started to speak gibberish which is very hard to understand. That is one of the reason that I does not like this book. Another was that it did not intrigue me so I did not want to read more. This was a real problem that I had trouble to come back to the book and reading more of the book that I thought was a complete waste of my time reading this book for me and also for you. This book is one of the worst book that I read in my whole life."
1,The worst book I ever read,"This book had nothing to interest me. The plot and characters were not appealing. The details were boring. I had to read this book for school otherwise I wouldn't have read it. Anyway, this is a really bad and boring book."
1,Do I have to give this any stars?,"This was required reading for me in high school English class. I had never in my life fallen asleep while reading before. I swear I fell asleep every time I picked up the book to read my assigned chapters. I am really not kidding. As an adult I saw this horrible book at a library book sale and spent a quarter on it just for nights I suffered with insomnia. I hope it will work years later, too. Really detested this book. No real point in reading it, unless you need to for a grade. Then, I guess, I wish you luck and lots of caffeine."
5,great insights in an interesting story,The view point expressed in this book are quite interesting. Not only an interesting story but one that gets you to think.
5,Wonderful story!,"Flowers for Algernon is a book I read more than 20 years ago but the story remains...So sad, so true, so important!"
4,Intelligence and Emotion,"An excellent story about intelligence and emotional life. It's the story of Charlie (""Charly"" in the movie adaptation), the apparently successful subject of an experiment to build the intelligence of a retarded man. But as Charlie's intelligence grows, so do the complications of his emotional life. The story is as much about his growing self-awareness, and the problems that brings, as it is about his intelligence.It's certainly readable as merciful that Charlie's intelligence, and his emotional issues, fade, as he returns to the life he had before his treatment.Algernon on the other hand . . . ."
3,Flowers for Algernon,"This book I found to be an interesting read, I read it aloud to my eight year old nephew who was really interested in the characters and the way the intereacted. I would highly recommend this book as it will take you on a journey with Charlie, how he changes and interacts with the people around him. A word of warning the last few pages you may need a hankie."
3,Flowers for Algernon Review,"I think Flowers for Algernon is an ok book. It deals with trying to make a retarded person smart.This book goes through the trials and tribulations of the effects his experiences. You get to see through a retarded person's eyes. All he wants to be is smart. When he finally is, it is not how he expected it to be. He has many hard times through this, but he is very grateful that he is smart, even though it is not what he expected. Charlie then finds out about his past, and the truth about his ""friends."" This book makes you think about the things that you take for granted."
2,"Brutally Honest, a whirl pool of emotions and yet--- predictable.","I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, ""What goes up must come down."" right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, ""coming of age"", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was before."
4,A good read,"I remembered seeing this movie as a kid with Cliff Robertson who plays a retarded man named Charly who works in a bakery and is shunned by his mom after his sister is born and his sister. He has an operation and becomes smart for a short period of time. After reading this book, I felt sorry for him because when he was retarded he was treated shabbily and when he was really smart people wouldn't leave him alone. I liked both the boook and the movie a lot. A good story telling of Charlys progress reports, a mouse named Algernon and his story on how his life changed. 4.5 stars"
3,DaveH,"""Flowers of Algernon"" by Daniel Keyes is an immersive reading experience that is both sad and uplifting. Based on mental retardation and brain science it is taxing on your soul because you want the best outcome and for a time you get partial satisfaction but it is fleeting. While the writing is brilliant this is not a story for everyone, I know I will not be revisiting it in what remains of my life..."
5,Don't pull a Charlie Gordon!!!,"Read this book. We are all Algernon's ... the points this book makes about the relative nature of perceived intelligence and the isolation and social interactions that go with it is wonderful. What we all crave is an emotional response, importance from peers and a feeling of belonging. What is intelligence anyway? Its very relative until one goes higher or lower than the norm and the table can turn quickly but to what end? We all walk the maze and this is a great book."
4,This is a fantastic book that gives inspiration to us all,"This is an enchanting story about a middle-aged man named Charlie Gordon who is mentally challenged. Every day is a never-ending battle for him. Charlie's only wish is to be a normal, average young man. Flowers for Algernon has inspired me, as I am sure other readers, to live their lives to the fullest and feel fortunate for what they have. This novel should be on your must read list. A+'s across the wall for Daniel Keys."
4,Flowers for Algernon is a touching and inspiring book,"Flowers for Algernon is a touching and inspiring book for any young reader that struggles in school. The main courtier, Charlie Gordon, should be commended for his motivation to excel in the field of education. It was also a wonderful book because it explores how ethical it is to operate on the human brain. I liked it because it was fascinating to see how Charlie's retardation slowly fades into oblivion and his IQ steadily rises. I would strongly recommend this book to any one, child or adult."
5,"An emotional, memorable book","There are few science fiction stories as touching as Flowers for Algernon. We care about Charlie because he's the focus of the story, not the experiment that makes him a genius. The ending moves us because we witness what's happening to him in human terms, not scientific ones. All good fiction is about the characters, something Daniel Keyes clearly understood. For that reason, Flowers for Algernon is- and will remain- a classic. A newer novel with a fairly similar theme- and very memorable characters- is An Audience for Einstein. Both books have a strong emotional impact that lingers."
4,Human Experiences,"Flowers for Alargenon is an exellent book. If you like science fiction and enjoy details these book is for you. Charlie, the main character of these book changes from a 65 IQ 32 year old to 185 IQ in a period of 6 months, at the same time he falls in love with his teacher and discovers his parents didn't realy loved him, if you want to know what he had to go through...read."
4,Charlie's Experience,"This is a great book full of real life experiences about a grown up retarted man, that all he wanted in life was to be like everyone else. Although this book is painful to read at times, the author's techniques don't let you put the book down. I recommend this book to everyone that likes science-fiction with a real life twist."
5,Unforgettable,"Charly is a touching movie that I recommend, but the book about the rise and fall of Charlie is far better, in part because of the stunning second half that the movie does not address. I did not want to let go of this book anymore than Charlie of his intelligent life. We go through the awareness, love and sadness of Charlie, and it isn't obvious what he and we are left with."
5,"A Tragic, Touching, Life - Changing Book","Flowers for Algernon had me welling up by the fiftieth page. Charlie is one of the kindest people one could ever cross paths with, yet people still took advantage of him and laughed at him because he was retarded. What was even more sad was that he thought they were all great friends. It doesn't get better after his operation, because all he does is alienate everyone who he used to know, and he finds out people aren't as kind as he thought. His memories of his childhood are chilling and sad, and I was on the verge of tears throughout the whole book. When he finds out he's deteriorating, I cried almost as much as Alice. Algernon's deteriation is also incredibly sad. I read it in three days because I couldn't stop turning the pages. The ending isn't the one you want, but it fits perfectly. I will never forget this stirring diary, and I assure you won't either."
5,A MUST READ BOOK!,"... I thought this book is just going to be a dumb love story book, but I was wrong! To me, I think this is a great book, the struggle that Charly has to go to kinda makes you think about life and how we would feel if we were in his kind of condition. In my opinion everone who likes to read books should read this book for sure!!"
4,tears,"I read this book a year ago and when I think of all the hardships he went through, I still cry. I enjoyed this book because of what it taught and how it puts you in a different world. Charlie Gordon a mentally-retarted man gets a chance to be ""smart"", but he finds that the world is difficult and full of horrors. Yes his intellect surpasses that of the doctors who operated and they, too become an foe. Algernon is the lab rat they tested the experiment on first, and now his brain is tuning to mush.Will the same happen to Charlie? That is a question yo will have to fingd out. I'm no spoiler! But even if your older a tear could probably come to your eye, go and read this wonderful book. ""Flowers for Algernon"""
3,Not my favorite...,"Although Flowers for Algernon was a well-written, creative book, it was definitely not one of my favorites. The way that the book was written through progress reports and entirely from Charlie's point of view was very interesting, yet somewhat confusing. The idea of the story, a retarded man gaining intelligence through futuristic surgery and writing of the experience, was great. What I think the problem was that the idea didn't really develop the way it should have; many of the characters as well as events were described very vaguely, and that confused me. What this book didn't have was the ability to keep me wondering; I really had no desire to pick up the book and keep on reading, and I probably wouldn't have if the book had not been assigned to me in English class. The point is, I did enjoy the book to some extent, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone nor would I ever read it again."
3,Flowers for Algernon,"I thought that this book was interesting. It was also very sad. Well written and an easy read. It certainly did not strike me as profound and was not what I consider to be a ""masterpiece"". As is the case with many of the books I read, I was expecting much more based on the reviews that I had read but I did enjoy the story."
3,Catching But Dissapointing....,"I recently read Flowers For Algernon, and I was undoubltly satisfied. The plot was great, yet the climax was very dissapointing. This book is about a mentally retarded boy's (Charly) insight on being normal or mentally handicapped. He and a mouse named Algernon are used by an experimentalists as guinei pigs. Charly's hopes are raised because he becomes a genius from a brain surgery he undergoes. His IQ is raised sky high, but his emotional self doesn't change much. He becomes emotionally disturbed with bad memories and feels lost in his thoughts all the time. In the end, Charly sadly turns back into his original retarded state. The ending is very upsetting and sad, because you feel very bad for Charlie. In conclusion, Flowers For Algernon is a very good book to read and educating as well as interesting."
4,book of morals,"""Flowers for Algernon"" is one of the most emotional books I have ever read. In this novel, you will follow the life of mentally retarded adult Charlie Gordon, and the experience he undergoes that makes him a genius.After an operation is performed on him, Charlie realizes the people he thought were his friends actually made fun of him all the time. He realizes that the lab men he thought brilliant were not the Gods he'd once thought they were. And he also realizes his love for his teacher, Alice Kinnian.But how long will his superior knowledge last? From his complex love life to the haunting memories of mom and dad, read this incredible story to find out about the successes and failures of Charlie Gordon."
5,Overall a great book,"I believe that Flowers for Algernon was a compelling and well-written novel by Daniel Keyes. This book talks about the realities of life and how poorly we treat mentally disabled people. It is true that most of the time we don't think of them as real people who have emotions also. Maybe not the same emotions, but they have emotions. I truly enjoyed reading this novel and I would definitely read it again. In some parts of this novel I became frustrated with the characters, but I was never bored. I never wanted to put it down because there were always compelling facts to keep me reading. Overall I think that this is a perfect book for teachers to assign to their students because everybody will be satisfied."
5,page turner,"I first read the short story in my english class back in 7th grade. The short story was really good and I knew that there had to be a novel of it. Sometime later,I found it looking through the library. This book is amazing. I couldn't put it down. It is very well written and is a page turner. Everyone should read this book."
4,"Very original, touching, and thoughtful!","I have to admit I didn't read this book by my own choice. Flowers For Algernoon was one of my summer reading books and I really didn't look forward to reading it. As soon as I started reading though, I saw that I had been assigned an excellent story. This story is a suspenseful tale about a mentally challenged man, named Charlie Gordon, who volunteers himself as a guinea pig for a very special experiment. He gets another chance at life, as an intelligent man... This book is one that will definitely stay on my mind for a long time to come."
3,Flowers for Algernon,"Flowers of Algernon was a nice book, it was different from others. It was about Charlie Gordon, who was mental disable and wanted to be smart really bad, more then anything in the world. Later on her realized that it's not everything to be smart, that it made some things worse. He also learns many things about his past and his family. It wasn't the best book I read but I think it's worth reading, because the overall story was good. They're where just some parts I didn't like."
5,Flowers for Algernon,"This is one of the most beautiful, well written books I've ever read. Emotion is poured into every word, so much that I cried at the end, which I usually don't do.If you haven't already, you NEED to read this book. It shows the transformation of a retarded man into a genius, and all of the emotional effects that betide him.I love Algernon!"
5,I love this story!,I read this book when I was in high school and it made me cry...twice! I cannot wait to finish it again and to see if it has the same effect.
1,horrible,"I picked up this book because my friend said it was her faverite and oor teacher agreed with her. When I went to the store the person who helped me find it said it was a great book and at home my dad said that it was great. So I was expecting a wonderful complex deep book when I took on my trip to NY. I was in for a big dissapiontment. From the very first entry I found my self staring out the plane window bored out of my mind. I kept reading waiting for the book to become intersting. It never did. It wasnt just that I was expecting a fabolous book and it didnt come up to what i thought it was going to be, It was just plain bad! Not every one agrees with me and I dont expect them to. But check out the bbok for your self and see what you think."
1,"A very bad book, written by a pathtic author.","I hated this book. It was very boring, because, the events in the book were very unrealistic and stupid. I wouldn't recommend this book. It is one of the most boring books I have ever read, next to lord of the flies. DON'T READ IT"
1,the second worst book ever,"For the longest time I believed this was the worst book ever. After reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I now realize it is the second worst book ever written. In both stories, nothing happens that is worth mentioning. It's just that kind of book that is critically acclaimed for how well it is written. However, the story is poor. I wrote better stories when I was in first grade.Basically, things happen in chronological order as they would in real life. However, they are not connected. It's true that in real life not everything is connected. However, if I wanted to experience real life, I wouldn't read it, I would live it. The point of a book should be to tell an interesting story. That is not what this book does."
4,A excellent book which has a lot of feelings.,"I enjoyed this book. I thought that the book was going to be boring because for the first couple of chapters all the author did was talk about his life. This book was about a man named Charlie Gordon who has an operation. Before the operation Charlie was retarted,and after the operation he was a genius. Overall I enjoyed the book and Daniel Keyes wrote an excellent book. Charlie had gone through a tough time in his life and this operation cahnges his live. This book was excellent. Brad Arcibald"
4,A brilliant writing.,"This is an amazing book. I love how Daniel Keyes portrays the many changes that occur in Charlie throughout his life. It shows how a man with so many problems is able to handle them with the help of his friends. After an operation to increase his intelligence, Charlie's life is changed upside down. He works at a bakery where he realizes people make fun of him. Slowly his brain starts developing, and he has more problems than he can handle. The reader is taken in by Charlie's many dilemmas. I recommend this book to people who enjoy an easy, well written book."
1,satisfaction guaranteed,"Being a normal woman, sex & romance mixed with adventure is a favorite reading choice. This book, however, crossed over to poor taste. I didn't like it."
2,Just ok!,"I was looking for new authors and came across Lucy Monroe. I love the whole Alpha Male thing and I loved the cover of this book as well as the write up! The sex scene was ok, could definetly have been better. I just did not feel or see the whole Alpha male thing going on! For the most part I thought the book was just ok, maybe borderline boring!"
1,Dead on arrival,"I wanted with anticipation for this product ans was let down. The charger simply doesn't work.It's been charging over 24 hours now and the charging light stays green, it doesn't change to red as mentioned in the manual.When I attempted to use it, thinking the battery was fully charged ( Maybe it came completely charged that's why it was green all the time), it's actually the opposite, the battery is completely drained."
1,JUNK,"This thing never Worked. I received it, Would not even Charge up, So I sent it back and ordered a New One, This One Showed up and Would Charge, But Lost Charge in 4 Hours of NO Use."
1,Worthless junk,"This unit wasn't able to charge up my battery enough to get it started in my Maxima, and didn't work at all in my Sienna. This was when the Schumacher device was on a full charge and I left it charging the car for 40 minutes.Get the kind of battery designed for jump-starting a car that attaches directly to the battery terminals instead. They work instantly.Additionally, the wall power adapter was damaged when I received this item, which had been previously opened."
5,This thing really works!,"This charger is amazing; small and light, and it really does the trick. Just plug it into the accessory outlet, let it charge for 10 or 15 minutes and start your car. No more need to call a tow truck for assistance for a dead battery. I now have one in all of my vehicles."
4,Well researched and very informative,"Shelves of books exist about whitetails, but very little is in print concerning blacktailed deer. Terkla fills a real need. I am an amatuer naturalist and a hunter, and I found his book to be very well researched. He cites from numerous studies found only in college archives and wildlife department file cabinets: information that is inexcessible to the general public. It compares favorably to the text on blacktails published in the 1950s by the Washington Department of Game (now the Department of Fish and Wildlife). Details include the seasonal movement and diet of blacktails, their favored habitat, and the best methods to observe and hunt these shy creatures. Forget about trying to translate what you read about whitetails or mule deer to the blacktailed deer. This book will deals with them specifically."
3,Progress Lighting P5779-19 Lantern / Questionable Color,"The glass was pretty and we wanted an open lantern so that part was good. But it is called ""Roman Bronze"" but actually it looks like it was painted brown. Not sure if we are going to keep it."
1,Doesn't work well with XP,"Used Laplink NT for years with good results but it did not perform with XP and new high resolution video, Ugraded to Gold Version 11.0. Was sorry. Don't think version 11.0 is XP ready. No matter how I configure ports or use manual setings this product will not work with my modern XP system and serial cable hook up. I get it going for about 10 megs of transfer and then it frezzes my computer.Also LAPLINK 11.0 reports start up errors. I select the LAPLINK autocorrect routine and the routine reports errors corrected please restart computer. Same thing happens next time. Have email problem to LAPLINK for solutions ... no response. I'd look at some other product before I selected LAPLINK 11.0 for an XP system."
1,Poor Quality,"This purchase reflects trying to stick to a budget. I learned that some things are worth a little more $$-especially if it's an item you might use (coffee, sugar dispensary) & see (on the kitchen counter) every day! I was trying to match the durability & price I remember paying in my college days at a small department store but apparently price has gone up & quality has gone down on these simple little products...biggest downside for me is that the lids don't line up perfectly with the canister & the little overhang (on one side) looks cheap while leading the contents to dry a quicker."
1,Mostly Useless,"Three of the lids are misaligned and the other one was broken off when I got it. The canisters are not airtight and barely close, but since return shipping is such a pain in the butt I just use them to hold teabags, lighters, and condoms. Don't waste your money. These don't belong in your kitchen."
2,Wouldn't buy again.,I am basically using this item for an accent decoration in my kitchen.They are much smaller than I anticipated and the quality is poor.Expected more from an Anchor product.
2,anchor ceramic canister set,"Received and had problem with lids aligning properly as another reviewer stated. The canisters are heavy and the color is nice, but all 4 lids are crooked when shut. The more you try to adjust them, the worse they become. Must be a design flaw or something...I guess the seal would still be airtight, but the lids not sitting correctly on the canisters makes the set look horrible when on display. I also do not like the seals are not attatched to the canisters, they slide and keep coming off."
2,"No, no.","I don't like the smell. It smells nothing like the lotion itself. It very very strong and heavy and made me dizzy. Also, it feels slimy when I washed with it. Will stick with the lotion."
4,Butter Bar,"I love my this Cocoa Butter soap, I use all the Palmer products line. If you only use the bar soap by itself it will make your skin feel kind of dry so I mix it will regular body wash. I receive compliments all the time on how soft my skin is. Would also recommend using in conjuction with the skin therapy oil after taking a shower. Perfect combination."
3,Not what I expected,Product was delivered sooner than expected. Rinses of with no residue. Unfortunately it dries my skin out a lot quicker than the Tone Cocoa Bars. Need to put some type of lotion on IMMEDIATELY once you get out the shower / bath.
2,Not my favorite,"After Captain Underpants, I had high hopes for this one, but it turns out to be just a pale reflection of ""Walter the Farting Dog."" For smelly dog stories, I'd stick with Walter; for the best of Dav Pilkey, it's probably best to just re-read Captain Underpants a few more times."
4,Gross! But my son loves it.,"I really don't like this book, just because it makes me squirm. But my son loves it. I think it is a boy thing. It is a fun book about a dog with really bad breath."
4,"Good, but heavy going","This book is very interesting but many, many characters, worlds, plots, etc. It's also very lengthy; I will probably not re-read."
4,A Rewarding Experience,"Pandora's Star is a book of epic proportions. It shows boundless imagination and is truly striking in its breadth and detail. Plot elements include (but are not limited to) numerous different worlds, an ""Intersolar Commonwealth,"" cults, vanishing stars, wormholes, interstellar starships not limited by light speed, repeated physical rejuvenation of body and mind, and a fascinatingly inhuman alien life form. It is also daunting in length. For me, the book took fully 700 pages to reach ramming speed, but it was so rich and unique that the effort itself seemed worthwhile. I intend to read the sequel, ""Judas Unchained,"" and I'm looking forward to seeing what Hamilton does with the universe he has created."
4,"a great SF read,and food for thought","My first, but not my last book by Hamilton. His characters are believable, which is amazing considering their diverse circumstances (aliens, news anchors, cops, a horny teenager, and Ozzie, a 300 year old dropout genius) Hamilton makes then all come alive. The most original alien I've seen in years adds to a great read. As I was finishing this I made sure to order the sequel ""Judas Unchained"". Hamilton had created a very rich universe."
5,Excellent,"Very good book, thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I will say however that you need to buy Judas Unchained (next book in the series) after reading it as the story does not have a resolution in this book."
4,Very long but very good!!,"I just finished reading Judas Unchained, the sequel to Pandora's Star. What can I say, it was an excruciating read (about 2,000 pages of very dense writing), but it was all worth it! An amazing story with depth and breadth, and most importantly: soul. I enjoyed it immensely. After a while I got tired of the expansive scenery descriptions and just skipped them. I'll go into them when I get back to these wonderful books. In the meantime, I'm off to other Hamilton books! Enjoy!P.S. Thank you very much Zohar for recommending these books to me, and making me buy them when we were at B&N;!!"
4,Standard Hamilton Space Opera,"Hamilton writes the best Space Opera around these days. If you liked the Reality Dysfunction series, you'll like this as well. Interesting ideas, epic scale, decent if not great characterization. Leaves you anxiously waiting for the next installment."
3,Too much of a good thing,"I read this book without the knowledge that there was a sequel until I reached the last page, which was just this afternoon. I began it nine weeks ago. I had to finish today because our library allows only two renewals. Peter Hamilton has created a thoroughly fascinating vision of our future so I can understand why he wanted to describe every millimeter of it in such loving detail. But do we really need to know the technical specifications of every locomotive, the interagency relationships of every bureaucrat, or the industrial capacity of every colonized planet? The plot was so dense and so uniform throughout most of the story that it could be likened to returning from your favorite bakery with a promising loaf of bread, and then stuffing too much in your mouth at once so that you can neither swallow it nor spit it out. You just keep chewing until finally it goes away."
2,readable...but dissapointing end,"I have a hard time not finishing a book once I start, but I came close with this one. It is simply too long, over 1100 pages, which could easily have been compressed into three or four hundred. However, the real problem is the ending, there is not one! After stuggling though the whole thing, it leaves you hanging with a little note saying it will be concluded in the next book. Are you kidding me!? You could not wrap it up in 1100 pages, you need a second book!? I am pretty sure I will ever know what happens to the commonwealth, just not worth getting through another book."
1,I wish i'd never read it.,This book seems like it came from the mind of a perverted 14 year old. The whole book is full of profanity and childish sexual themes (Almost every character it seemed like). And this book should have been half the number of pages. The plot was full of tangents and pointless long-winded dialog. I wish i'd never read it. I don't recommend it at all.
2,bloated and shallow,"Too much emphasis on exposition, and not enough depth to the drama. WAY TOO MUCH vulgarity. That kind of writing turns SciFi into trash. The ending isn't a cliff-hanger, er falls-hanger and I feel I wasted my time on this novel. When authors do this I have no interest in the sequel. Written with a British perspective and style which doesn't translate well to Yankee expectations."
3,should come with a warning label.,"Ok, first of all, its not a space opera. Very little of it actually happens anywhere in space.Second, the book should come with a very clear indication on the cover : this is the first book in the series, DO NOT start unless you are content with not getting ANY sort of conclusion to the story at the end of the first book.It really only started getting interesting in the second half, and then abruptly cut off.Some of the characters in the story ring very hollow too, and at points the environmental descriptions get to be really tedious and irrelevant."
2,Needs better editing.,"I gave up after 650 pages... his tendency is to obsessively detail every planet's geology, culture, development, and history only to have it have no actual relevance to the plot, while leaving most of the humans without discernable motivations beyond the broadly comic and obvious.Entire swaths of this ""epic"" could be cut without impacting the core story. And yes, I skipped to the end only to discover no good resolutions... only buy this if you're prepared to endure 3000 eventual pages of this largely unedited meandering.I'm not afraid of space opera: I love Iain M Banks' Culture books, Alastiar Reynolds' series, and others back to Larry Niven. But those authors provide detail to propel the story, to add relevance and texture. Hamilton is not in this league."
2,A box you may not want to open...,"Somewhere within the 1,000 pages of this book is a very good 600 page book struggling to emerge.In Hamilton's desire to craft a comprehensive future world he launches into sub-plots, characters and details that fail to serve his story line. The result is a story that plods along relieved by only moments at a quicker pace.When the pace picks up Pandora's Star is difficult to put down. Alas, these moments are far too few leaving one looking for the end of chapters in the hope that the next chapter will bring more energy.Halfway through Pandora's Star I became aware that this was only the first half of the story. Only after reading some 2,000 pages of Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained is this saga brought to a close. Given the slog to get through Pandora's Star, Judas Unchained may have to await my being stranded on a desert island."
2,The audiobook is nearly unlistenable,"The narrator starts out his sentences incredibly loud, then trails off into a barely audible mumble at the end. If you turn the sound up high enough to catch the ends, the start will be intolerably loud. I had to run the whole book through a Dynamic Range Compression filter and re-burn to CD to make it a tolerable experience. But the content of the book is pretty good, so I'm giving it 2 stars."
3,"Great story,but in need of a new editor","This is and interesting and unique situation.I think that a producer should pick this story up and make this into a mini-series or even a limited series,because the story i think is awesome. But the editor should have paid more attention to what the writer was writing and how.I found myself skipping whole chapters because,the writer just rambles on,and on about the scenery,instead of building up his characters."
5,Pandora's reviewer. Why write a spoiler for a recent book?,"Frodo gets the Ring to Mt. Doom, Gandalf lives but Gollum dies.So does Saruman, he's killed by Wormtongue.Aslan dies but rises again in The Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe.Darth Vader is Luke's father.Harriet K, WHY did you write a SPOILER without a warning??I bought this book yesterday and read it until 2am. I'm on about page 300 so not even close to half way. Now rather than heading towards the ""amazing cliff hanger"" described by the other reviewers you've exposed the whole mountain range!The reviewer above who posted when he was on about page 250 shows that readers will check this page before they finish the book. Let alone buy it.Great book, it has the same addictive quailities as the Night's Dawn trilogy."
4,Left Hanging!,"I have read books before that were part of a series and even though they they continue in the next book, each book in the series has some type of ending. What I didn't like about this book is that I read almost 1000 pages to be left completely hanging until the sequal! Other than that... it was a great book, very well written. It could have been a little shorter. There was a lot of detail, most ot it incredibly interesting but some was completely useless and uninteresting. This is sci-fi! Why do I care what color of leather pumps Paula is wearing? Anyway that was minor. Will I read the sequal? Of course! I need to get to the conclusion. I wonder if it is just as long?"
3,Just OK book,"I got bored after reading it for a while. The book has too few ideas, and is too verbose at the same time. The concept of ""rejuvenation"", that is, anti-aging treatment, is neat, but after seeing the word ""rejuvenation"" repeated more ten times on each page the whole thing starts wearing you out. A good and balanced book on how life may look in a far-future society (while also having a neat and well-developed story) is ""Looking to Windward"" by Iain Banks, for folks who like such things."
4,Can't put it down!,"I must admit, one star off for the weird grammar usage (punctuation misuse is more like it), but other than that this is definitely a page turner! I haven't finished yet, but the depth of the character profiles is intriguing; there are tons of characters to like and dislike in the first half of the book. Environments are nicely fleshed out (and there are many), and supporting characters are used sparingly. This is not 'hard' sci-fi, but includes some interesting tech. Hamilton's writing reminds me of Fredrik Pohl's 'Gateway' series, and I miss that in most of today's authors. Great find!"
4,Pacing problems,"I would have given it 3.5 stars if possible. I enjoyed reading it quite a bit. There are interesting aliens, characters and situations. There are also a few surprises and twists. However I was sick of all the exposition by the hundredth time I read a two-paragraph description of some alien plant that does little for the story. Just when the action builds up and you can't wait to see what happens, you're off to some boring and depressing trek through the galaxy or a chapter how one family lives on a ""green"" area on one planet. I ended up skimming through much of the last fourth of the book. Some of the situations set off my logic buzzer, but I'll see how the follow-up,Judas Unchained, explains them."
5,"Oh, yeah!","""Pandora's Star"" is very imaginative, full of action and populated with new worlds and interesting characters. It has the best ending of any novel I have read by Hamilton. It made me pump my fist and say ""Yes!"" then go immediately for ""Judas Unchained."""
2,No cigar,"For a 1,000 page volume one of a series, it had better be pretty compelling reading to merit the readers lengthy involvement. I got about 3/4 of the way thru this when I decided, it's just too bloated for my tastes. There's quite a bit of good space opera going on here, but I agree with some of the other reviewers, this fella needs some editing."
1,"Overwritten, bloated and in need of a red pen","I have just put this book down, a little more than halfway through. The only other author I've ever done that for is Robert Ludlum. Like Ludlum, Hamilton has never met a word he didn't like. Every person place or thing has multiple modifiers and the action is explained, rather than allowed to unfold. Add some cliche characters (Dead-head style Techno Billionaire wandering through space, 'Right-Stuff' Space Captain, etc) include way too many side plots and story lines and this wandering, undisciplined tome is just too much work. Are there no editors? No red pencils or pens? If I knew his address I'd send Peter Hamilton a copy of Strunk & White. There are still some great Alien-Culture, Hyperspace-Travel genre sic-fi books out there. This isn't one of them"
3,"Great book, but could've been half the size","This is one of those books where, when you are finished, you can say you enjoyed it and are looking forward to the sequel, but there were times when I had my doubts. There is a lot of excess and even minutia that could have been edited and the book would have been a better read w/o losing any of the story line.There are plenty of characters to like and hate (seems like more to hate) and some that seem extraneous. Maybe they will become important in the sequel. One major disappointment was the inevitable attack, it does not come until the top of the 10th inning and then the home team strikes out. I guess this is supposed to help sell the sequel, but I found it to be too abrupt. Another issue I had was the long, drawn out trip through the Silfen pathways, what is that all about?The bottom line is the book is enjoyable, and I await the sequel. I just hope Hamilton finds it in heart to condense things a little more."
3,politics!,"this book is not without serious problems. hamilton builds an incredible universe and does an excellent job immersing the reader in it. he is however often too verbose in his storytelling.what really bothered me in this novel was the many pages devoted to politics, and working of deals, buying of favors and elections, and economic tradeoffs. i just got more and more upset having to read through chapter 17, as hamilton tells the story of how the super-elite humans of the commonwealth got together and traded political favors. i don't read sci-fi to hear about people bidding for contracts to service space vessels.this book is almost 1000 pages, and when you consider that it's really the first half of larger book, it's around 2000 pages. i'd think mr. hamilton would do his readers a favor by cutting out some of the fluff. i learned in 2nd grade that writing more does not equal writing better."
1,Bad SiFi,"Unfortunately this is another example of an author that believes that the only way to sell his work is to pollute it with sexual content. Strip out the irrelevant sex and it could have been a good book, though the lack of conclusion is disappointing."
1,Publishing and Seller EPIC FAIL,"The book would probably have been good, but when I got to page 252, the book jumped directly to page 669. At page 732, the book started back at page 317 and continued until the end. Thus, the pages of 669-732 replaced 253-317, and were then repeated in their normal succession after that. The book was good until then. I would not have given this purchase any stars, but I was forced to put at least one."
3,Good but mainstream influence sucks,"Was a huge fan of The Reality Destruction...This book would have been very high on my list with exception of two things which seem obligatory in every type of entertainment:Specific promotion of interracial relationships... and how Hamilton figures that in a ""multicultural"" society that different races would totally subscribe to a single ancient culture (which does not even exist today) eludes me.And the second being homosexuality on the part of one of the main characters. 1-3 percent of the population; odds are probably not... but as usual have to work it in somehow.Generally speaking Hamilton should not play up the sex element in his novels, it never smoothly works into whatever scene he's writing when it is beyond vague references."
1,Way Too Long Not much happens some bad science,There is enough meterial in this 800 page book for a 100 page book. If you read it you should start by writing down all of the charactars' names and a brief discription of who they are to keep track of them. You can save a lot of time when you get to the chapters delaing with Ozzie's quest by just skipping them.
1,"Nice SciFi, but Too much profanity","I enjoy good scifi and Pandora's Star is certainly good scifi. I understand one is likely to encounter some profanity in today's literature, but Pandora's Star went well past the limit of what I felt was reasonable. More than once I contemplated stopping without finishing the book.I also feel that the amount of profanity and nature of the profanity fails scifi itself. In a world 400 years from now, a world that has worked to ban words like ""war"" from the collective vocabulary, I would hope that, if not eliminated, the amount of profanity people with wormhole and rejuvenation technology would experience would be far less than contained in this book. If won't happen if today's authors keep using as much profanity as Hamilton does in this book. This spoiled the book and series for me. As much as I would like to see what happens to the characters in this book, I will pass on the rest of the series because of the profanity."
2,Somewhere under all that fat...,"Somehow it all went wrong with the Naked God...ten sub-plot jostling for page space until the bitter end. The same with this tree killer. Lots of characters and very little action - and when it happens it catches you almost off guard' and in a semi-comatose state of endless pap and hackney'd character development. Somewhere under all that fat lurks a damn fine story. But like his previous soap epic it needs some damn tight editing and slicing off useless subplots and endless descriptions of hang-gliders on mountain tops, industrial parks and silly love scenes.Come on Hamilton...don't write shaggy dog stories. You have immense talent and super ideas...just compress them a bit like you used to do in the early 'leaner days' of the Nano Flower....Oh, and stop trying to write like an American. It's a bit embaressing mate!!"
5,Epic,"I could not put this book down. Hamilton has a talent for thrilling plot lines and vivid description. The characters are engaging and complex, they have real depth that draws you in. The book starts a little slowly as the author introduces the various characters, locations and plots but it turns into an amazing journey through a richly imagined universe.I love the cliffhanger ending, I found it shocking. I will definitely get the sequel!"
3,A Complex Listen,"I listened to this book after purchasing and downloading from Audible.com. I listen while I ride a road bike, so keeping track of a complex plot isn't easy. There's no doubt I would have enjoyed Pandora's Star much more if I read it. As a listen, I found it very difficult to keep track of the myriad number of characters, and often had trouble figuring out what a particular character had to do with the main plot. Folks that read it seem to have loved it, but was too complicated and too long to listen to."
1,1100+ pages of mediocre prose & dull storytelling,"I was expecting a big, sprawling, colourful galactic-milieu story in the vein of Brin, Cherryh, or Niven. Book is big alright (1144 pages!), but I've rarely come across such dull, lifeless prose and mediocre storytelling. Endless boring descriptions that convey nothing interesting or significant, inane dialogue, and a vast array of characters so indistinguishable, lifeless and lacking in depth or personality that calling them one-dimensional would be generous. I'd recommend this book only if you have alot of time to kill and don't really care how you spend it. Might be a good book to read in prison, for example (where it's size and weight might make it a good weapon)."
3,Interesting but way too long,"I guess the good news is that I found this book interesting and entertaining enough to slog through almost 1000 pages. As a consequence, I was rather dismayed to reach the end only to find that the tale abruptly stops, unresolved and I have to wait for the next installment. Hopefully, the next volume will be edited for length.One other quibble - in the preface there is what turns out to be gratuitous swipe at religious conservatives who oppose embyonic stem cell research. It is claimed that this puts the US at some disadvantage viz. Europe, but we hear nothing else about this in 900+ pages, so what was the point?"
4,"btw, I did mention the concrete is enzyme bonded, right?","I'm giving it 4 stars because if you can get past the first half of the first book, the second half (as well as the second book) start to pay dividends. Yes, he's a little verbose but I guess I got used to it and in the end the rewards outweighed the costs."
3,A little too long,"I have enjoyed Hamilton's earlier books in the series, and quite liked Pandora's Star, but not as much as the earlier novels.I felt that the novel was a little too padded out and would have benefited from a little trimming to bring back the page-turning qualities of the earlier books (they were long too, but didn't feel it... Pandora's Star, sadly does).A good effort, though, and I'll still be picking up his next work to see how it fares.Maybe one to get from the library or borrow from a friend if you don't have the money to buy it now."
2,read without expectations,"I had never read any of his books ,have been reading Science Fiction since 1954 and I know a guy who doesnt know what he is doing when I see one .The story is very good but it is so filled with useless junk that unless you are really curious like I am,you will put the book down.Someone please tell him ,he is writing a book ,not a screenplay.not good"
4,Good. Not on par with previous work.,"Unlike the Reality Disfunction trilogy and Falling Dragon, which were very fluid, sometimes I felt like I could do without so much description. Hamilton overdid it.I also found many similarities between some characters of the trilogy and this book. I won't go in detail to avoid spoiling it for you, but some were old ideas with a new twist.That being said, I enjoyed the book and could not wait to get the sequel (same thing happened with the trilogy). If you have enjoyed previous Hamilton books, you will enjoy this one too. If not, I'd suggest reading Falling Dragon first, then the Trilogy, and then this one. Take into account that ""Pandora's Star"" and ""Judas Unchained"" are one book. There is no conclusion at the end of ""Pandora's Star""."
1,on...and on...and on....and...,"Read something else. I've read other books by Hamilton, and enjoyed them enough to buy this one. Mistake. It seems as if Hamilton was trying to see how many pages he could write without anything occurring...or perhaps, how many pages of poor, uninteresting writing his readers could stomach (Hundreds and hundreds apparently). I read 600 pages of this uninteresting garbage before I finally couldn't take anymore.Maybe this is too harsh. Perhaps there is some kind of virtuous artistic gift required to write lengthy accounts of nothingness. If there is, I simply have not acquired the taste, and probably won't. There is no hero, no hope, no story, no plot, no action, and no inspiration. However, those noble readers who managed to read all 988 pages deserve some recognition for obvious virtuous traits they possess: patience, endurance, long-suffering."
1,Extremely disappointing,"Reading Pandora's Star was extremely disappointing for me. I very much enjoyed Peter Hamilton's previous works, so was looking forward to another great read. What I found was 758 pages of boredom. The characters were too numerous, shallow, and mostly unengaging. The plot was also severely lacking. Nothing important happens over most of the book. The action is better suited to fill a short story than two entire novels. The rest is filler that is unbelievably tedious to plow through. I was able to get through only half of the book before giving up and speed reading the rest of it."
2,I Agree With The Others: Needs Editing,"I'll throw my two cents in there with the rest and say that this book was just too long. It's a rare book that I start skimming certain threads and this is one of them. It finally started to pick up in the last 200 pages, but when you have to wade through 800 to 900 to get there, that is not a good thing.If it was 300-400 pages lighter, then it could be a 4-5 star book.Seems like modern fiction authors feel the need to go through this rite of passage and birth a few of these monster books."
3,Hire better editors...,"The book goes from laborious to exciting and back to laborious in a matter of a few pages. At one point about 300 pages in, I struggled with whether or not to throw it away. I kept reading, as I had already invested so much time. The story is quite interesting, but after finishing the book, there are many parts that seem frivolous and unnecessary.The biggest disappointment came in the last few pages. The way Mr. Hamilton chose to end this first of two books outraged me, and I nearly tore the book to pieces as I finished the last sentence. The end of Pandora's Star was anti-climactic and a bit insulting to the reader. As cliffhangers go, well, it was less like a cliff and more like a curb."
2,Warning: this is an unfinished work,"Yes, this is not a complete novel. This is the first installment of a collection and none of the plots, subplots, etc. are resolved at the end of this book. You are left hanging, waiting for the next installment.As many reviewers mentioned, this book has a multitude of characters. The plot lines are so numerous that it makes for a bit of confusion. I contemplated putting this book aside on several occasions, but held on to the end, hoping to see the outcome. I was disappointed. The end was not the end of the story. No resolution or closure. I'm sorry that I bought it. I won't buy the next."
4,Space opera,"Hamilton is a great author who walks the line between too much geek and not enough detail. The science he describes just plausible and in depth enough to satisfy the arm chair engineer in me.That said, he is verbose when it comes to setting up and introducing characters. More than 100 pages into the novel you are still meeting new characters and after 200 pages you are still trying to remember who they all are.Overall it is an enthralling read that, once under your skin, is impossible to put down."
2,Downhill after the first 300 pages,"If I had been asked to rate this work after the first 300 pages, I would have been hard pressed not to award 5 stars. However, the last half was a real slog. In fact, I had to skip a 100 or so pages near the end just to say I finished it - only to find that almost nothing had been resolved after all this effort. I don't mind (and sometimes really enjoy) multi book series but not this one. An editor with a liberal red pen would have improved this book considerably."
1,Overstuffed,"The terrible secret of this book, which I can now reveal without spoiling it for future readers, is that after 768 meandering pages the author needed a sequel to finish his story. Doesn't Hamilton have an editor, someone to tell him that his novel contains hundreds of pages of pointless detail, a multitude of unnecessary characters, and stupefyingly boring subplots? Yes, the premise of solar systems mysteriously enclosed by forcefields, and humanity being manipulated by a shadowy alien, is fascinating, but this could have been realized in a third of the space Hamilton used. (If you want a good lengthy read about aliens, try Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space, which is only 476 pages!)"
2,Europa II Solar Light set only average,"The prior reviews on this product looked very good and the price was simply GREAT. But, alas, the price was again, to good to be true. Each light comes with it own set of rechargeable batteries and putting the lights together is a breeze. But, like most non-wired lights, these don't put out much illumination and even on full sunny days about a third of the lights can't muster more than a half-hearted glow for a few hours at night.The clear lenses produce a pleasing soft light blue illumination. If the lights are placed about 18"" apart, they may be suitable for lighting ground cover and walkways, but don't expect more from them. However, they are a tremendous value. At less than $7.00 each, they are still cheap if only half of them work effectively."
3,"Nice looking, but don't work too well ....","I may have been somewhat naive when I bought these, having never purchased solar lights before. All of the lights work and are very attractive, so no complaints there. However, those that don't get full sunlight (in the shade of a tree/the house, etc.) stay on for less than an hour. I can watch each light fade in succession depending on the amount of light it got during the day ! I bought these in September, so maybe they'll work better when the days get longer again. Given how inexpensive they were, I'm not that put out, but I'll be wary of buying solar lights in the future."
2,Not in love with these.,"I ordered these a couple of months ago, but my patio is finally installed so I just put them out last week. In two of the lamps, the batteries will not hold a charge at all. In the rest of them, so far they are only holding about a three hour charge after dark. I suspect that the batteries that are used in these are not the best. I may buy some new nicd batteries and test to see if they work better. I suspect that buying new batteries for all of the lamps may cost more than the lamps. The lamps themselves are very attractive when they are not in the dark."
4,Nice Lights,"These lights are very nice. They emit a bright white glow and are prettier than the yellow tinted glow you see with most other lights. They recharge nicely and are nice and bright each evening.I would not put these in a high traffic area. The top lantern is affixed to the shaft with a plastic ring. This plastic ring cracks very easily. Three of mine are broke because of a car door, kids playing in the yard and bumping into it and the dog running and bumping into it. I used them to line my driveway and that was not a good idea. I highly suggest these be installed in an area where people aren't going to run into them. They should be used in very, very low traffic areas. I was not happy that the lantern breaks off so easily since the rest of the unit seems pretty solid.All in all these are great lights for the price. If you keep them out of people's way they should last a very long time."
1,Dud batteries included,"Lamps look great, but be prepared to replace most of the rechargeable batteries. At $2.50 per rechargeable ni-cad battery it's not such a great deal after all."
5,The ones to buy,"The Westinghouse Europa II Solar Light Set is the one to buy. The metal construction, brightness, clean design, and easy assembly make this set an excellent choice."
4,"Great price, need more illumination","All of my lights arrived from Amazon.com in working order. The light emitted by the LED is bright white but does not illuminate a large patch of ground. These lights are more than decorative, in that they illuminate a 6' wide circle, but they don't provide enough light for safety purposes (IMHO). Excellent price and quality!"
4,Looks great in the yard,Performance has been great. The lights last well into the night and produce good light intensity. I would have rated it 5 stars except one of the lights didn't work properly when received.
5,"Nice bright lights, work great","Much brighter than your average wimpy solar light, and much better made. Steel and glass instead of plastic. Very good value. The batteries are conventional ni-cads, so when they die, you can easily replace them.All of them worked right out of the package, but based on other reviews it appears your mileage may vary. If you get one that doesn't appear to work, you might try swapping out batteries with one that does in order to see if that's the problem. But you're a bright individual, you already figured that out.Buy them, impress your friends, astound your enemies."
2,Works OK in sunny location; poorly in partial shade,"I have had several different solar lights over the years and was looking forward to these metal, high brightness set at a good price. When compared to cheaper solar lights, these units are much brighter and whiter. However, in terms of performance I was dissapointed on a couple of fronts: on cloudy days the lights located in direct sunny spots did not light anywhere close to 8 hours and the ones located in partial shady spots lasted even shorter time; on rainy days the lights located in sunny spots lasted even less and were dim, whereas the ones located in partial shade did not even come on."
3,Need Full Sunlight,"These are very nice lights for the price. They do need full sun however. I have some in full sun and some in shade, and the shaded ones will not hold a charge, even in summer hours. So I get a mottled effect as some are brighter than others."
3,The Best,"I bought one set for home, and liked it so much I bought two more for my Summer home. They actually come fully-charged so they work right out of the box. The sets in Maine work from sundown to sunup, and their appearance adds a decorative touch.These lights are well-packed, well-made, and simple to install. And they are cheap!"
1,Bad Service,I bought this lights and 14 out of 15 failed. I asked for replacement parts they said it will take 4 to 6 weeks. After 30 days I can not send lights back. I think they are junk. Even firefly has more light.
3,Just ok,"At times, most of the lights would work and then some wouldn't work at all. I guess that's the risk you take when you get solar lights. Out of the box, a few didn't work at all. They probably would be a good product if you have a lot of light to power them but wouldn't recommend if the area you want to light only gets a few hours of sunlight a day."
2,not too happy,"3 of mine are already not working at all. I guess you have to buy 15 to get 12 that work. They are pretty flimsey too. My 2 year old grandson bumped into one and broke it clean in two. So now Im down to 11 that actually work. Guess I shoulda picked up the ones from wallyworld where they had a different brand for 14.00 for 4 lights. Dont know if they would be any better, but at least they would have been cheaper price wise."
4,IT IS NOT THAT GREAT,"AGAIN, WITH IS PRICE AND YOU DONOT HAVE TO GO OUT FOR SHOPPING, PEOPLE LIKE ME, IT IS GREAT"
5,Excellent Purchase,Great value for the $$. Easy to install. Strongest feature: Lights worked well with only about 3 hours of sunlight per day.
1,"Look good in daylight,not at night!","The batteries are horrible! If they do charge they do not last over a couple of hours. The stems are very flimsy,my dogs knock them over. If I had not kept them over 30 days they would be returned. Buy electric ones you will be more satisfied. I even checked on replacing the batteries. I will probably throw them in the trash,the batteries cost more than the light set. So you might figure out if the replacement batteries cost that much ,what grade they use for this set!"
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"The lights that work stay on for less than one hour. A couple of the fifteen have never worked... I believe that if I replace the rechargable batteries, I might get longer service. If that does help, one would have hoped that they would have arrived with better batteries.They look nice when they are on."
5,Must Read,"For the socially concious person this book is a must read. Story about the women of Juarez is a heartbreaker, but a story that must be told."
4,"Good show, some material already in Dirty Jobs","I love seeing how things are made and this show didn't disappoint. I was a little put off seeing ""repeated"" material from the Dirty Jobs shows. Dirty Jobs did a better presentation but overall this was good."
5,Xbox (360) Backpack,"This backpack is a very well made convieniance. It holds the original xbox and the 360 (with a seprate paded case for the 360 consol) - its made very durable, and holds controllers and games, along with the cords and gizmos you may need for excellent gameplay."
5,Bolso de muy buena calidad,"El bolos es muy resistente y con muchos compartimientos, ademas se puede utilizar para otras cosas"
3,Leaves out any discussion of Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs),"Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) have proven to have side effects down around the placebo level for most people. This book does not even mention them even though the first, Losartan, came out in 1995 and is now available as a generic.Don't trust me. Do your own research but just be aware this book does not even mention this important class of drugs in chapter 31. The book had a second printing in 2001 so no excuse for this.That said, I learned much that was valuable from reading the book. For example, it pointed out that exercise involving several large muscle groups raises BP only slightly. It also pointed out that vigorous exercise and certain drugs may not play well together, e.g, Beta blockers and diuretics.You just have to read widely to get complete information no matter what the subject."
4,B. Steyer,Has a lot of good info to get yourself started on the right track to taking care of hypertension the natural way.
3,A Bit Too Theoretical,"This is not a bad book. It covers a lot of ground. But at times it gets a bit too theoretical, rather than being down to earth. I saw the reviews that liked it, but several of them were by financial managers. For those of us who are not financial managers, there is quite of a bit of mathematics and theory. For example, for capital budgeting there is a whole chapter of mathematical formulas with a small paragraph saying no one really uses the formulas - they use calculators or computers. But there was no discussion about what calculator or computer program to buy or how to do the calculations with a calculator or computer. The book is also pretty much out of date, espeically in areas like the tax chapter."
2,Blah,This item was required reading for Master of Organizational Management program. Found the info to be less than helpful and not easy to apply.
4,Careful with the pillowcases - sweat will bleach them...,"I bought Celedon, Windstream, Brick and Haze all with matching sheet sets on sale. I must agree with the other reviewers regarding the softness and warmth.The only 2 big problems I have found with the matching sheet sets so far is LINT everywhere! I wake up with it in my hair, all over my duvet, pjs etc. After 3 washings the lint problem has finally receeded - So make sure you wash them a couple times before using or you'll have lint everywhere.The other issue I have faced is with the pillowcases (Celedon, Haze and Windstream). It is very strange, but if you sweat, drool, wear a face cream etc, the color on the cases fade. It looks like someone has spilled bleach on them. I will not/have not used the Brick pillowcases, for fear of the same thing happening.Regardless, the duvet covers are very soft, warm and comfortable. They made a big difference on the coldest nights in winter.If this review helped you please vote for it..."
5,"Awesome duvet, nice and soft!","These 100% cotton duvets are just great. They are soft and fuzzy. Twin size is quite large (around 64 inches??). There are buttons at the bottom to insert your fillings. Prices are wonderful. I bought a couple for my grandma, and she loves it. It help keep her warm during chilly nights. Highly recommended, and the best duvet offered by Amazon (ie., free shipping over 25)."
2,Bleached by water? But it feels great!,"I got this with a duvet cover and both feel GREAT! But after my partner drooled on the pillow case there were little spots that looked like bleach had been splatered on the pillow cases. And when sweat got on the sheets after a hot night there were spots there too. I have never seen this before and am very disappointed because the sheets feel great, but aesthetically it's a big disappointment. Anyone else having similar issues should please post them here or post how they resolved their issues."
3,Wamsutta Review,"The product itself is very nice, but there must have been a problem with the website, because i chose a different color (red)! It aloud me to select the other color and then I got this one instead. Unfortunately I was on vacation and missed the return window. Otherwise, the product is great!"
1,Seams not sewn all the way,"After I received the first one with one of the side seams not sewn shut (like it got off alignment on the machine for 2-3 seconds), the replacement that Amazon sent had the same exact thing, but in a different location. If you have any sewing skills, not a big deal, but I expect my purchases to be complete upon arrival. I am sending the second one back, requesting refund, not replacement. Too bad, it was a nice soft cover!"
1,duvet cover,i didnt order this cover and hope not to be charge for it so far i havent seen any charges for it
3,Are we doomed?,"Seems like doomsday is around the corner and overpopulation is the main problem nowadays. The documentary is well made, comprehensive and balanced. Unfortunately, I found it to be boring. I think, that the commentaries made by the scientists and experts could be more emphatic if they showed more examples of the destruction caused by man. Al Gore in his documentary is far more eloquent in his statements and he also supports them with very clear, abundant and reliable data/info. Can anything be done to save the human race? The planet will survive, but not humanity if the environmental devastation continues to worsen. What will our future and the future of our children really look like? ¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø..................???????"
5,The 11th Hour review,"I've purchased and watched three different videos on global warming: ""An Inconvenient Truth"", ""The Great Warming"" and ""The 11th Hour"". There are advantages and disadvantages to each. ""An Inconvenient Truth"" does a great job of presenting the science behind GW but is not well received by some due to the political image of the narrator. ""The Great Warming"" a Canadian documentary film, is a very comprehensive and well scripted presentation on GW suitable for all audiences. They have two versions tailored for churches, one for wildlife organizations and a general version. ""The 11th Hour"" is a hard hitting video. The first 2/3rds left me believing we are all screwed. The last segment demonstrated a lot of technological remedies to reduce GHGs but I wasn't left feeling hopeful. Everyone should see at least one of these. Maybe then we can convince our elected officials to take some action."
3,Documentary okay.,This documentary is just okay. It is more informative and educational than An Inconvient Truth and doesn't exaggerate as much. I believe it betrays global warming more factually and shows more critical thinking. It does suggest that the earth will be okay but humanity may suffer real setbacks. The documentary had less sizzle though and Leonardo DiCaprio disappoints me. He had less persona than the scientists. I thought this documentary would just copy Al Gore's documentary but it doesn't. This documentary would have been better airing on Discovery than theaters.
4,Compelling,"After viewing a colleague's copy of 11th Hour I bought the video for use in my high school Environmental Studies course. My students, most certainly the girls, know Leonardo DeCaprio. This is important because the students listen with open minds when the presenter is credible. Mr. DeCaprio's straightforward, genuine approach is far more desirable that the all-too-common boob in a labcoat. No, I'm not referring to Bill Nye. Bill is solid and effective. The multitude of Bill wannabes are not.11th Hour refrains from hyperbole and heavy-handed far left propaganda. The cinematography is evocative. The mega slum sequences are especially memorable.So, why 4 stars and not 5? Too much talking head time. The talking heads are fine, but they are in need of sharper editing. Even though I presented 11th Hour in five segments over a week's classes, the pacing felt a bit slow. Otherwise, an excellent production that remains fresh and relevant."
4,Nothing New But Well Done,Good movie but it's all kind of old news to me by now. Time to take care of the planet!! Thanks Leo :-)
5,This is a great product for a great price.,I love this Cd called The 11th Hour by Leonardo DiCaprio because it was a very informative documentary about our planet.
5,My favorite docu about our ENVIRONMENT,"I have watched a lot of these documentaries. Some are too long and repetitious and takes too much patience for me.This one moves along at a pretty fast clip. Don't blink or you will want to back it up.You get lots of extra run on special features, and some also very interesting.This is not a docu of all doom and gloom, but, of serious concerns while offering some practical solutions, Personally, I am not that optimistic that Gov. will stop corporations from putting profits before human life.Nevertheless, greedy exploitation of the earth will be stopped according to a prophecy in Revelation 11:18. God will, ""BRING TO RUIN THOSE RUINING THE EARTH."" Is that real change or what? Meanwhile, let's each view ourselves as God's stewards of a beautiful planet."
4,Provocative,Very good documentary - challanges our current way of thinking and the future of this planet...
4,some new insights for me,"I thought I knew what to expect from this film when I bought it but it was the little insights and bits I hadn't heard before that made it worth while for me--the concept of ancient sunlight, native American viewpoints on what we've done to the planet, and attempts to bring technology back to natural ideals.I would recommend it as a supplement to some of the other films on the subject of global warming."
4,Well worth it...,I paid $4.95 for my copy so was extremely pleased. The documentary provides the best all around analysis of the devastation caused by the disease that is the human race. The only shortcomings are Leonardo Dicaprio's reading the tele-prompter as if he was actually concerned and the lack of solutions proposed. Great movie for anyone who is interested in being educated about the global energy crisis and environmental problems associated with humans occupying the entire planet.
4,recommended by Sierra Club Sahuaro Group Film Club,We enjoyed the film as a whole. The photography and message were clear and important. I hope more people see it and discuss it like we did.
3,OK,"The message is an important one regarding the environment. However, I didn't feel there was anything new about the information. On the good side I think I am a bit more motivated to do more in regards to my personal impact on the environment."
4,Does for Inconvenient Truth what Blue Gold does for water!,"When I saw Inconvenient Truth, I felt I asked ""where's the film?"" It was a speech somebody famous was giving, but ultimately just a speech. 11th Hour is a FILM, which is what a documentary should be. Another great example of how powerful film can present facts is Blue Gold World Water Wars, which I also review and which has been called by press 'The Inconvenient Truth about water'. 11th Hour should be watched by all and I hope it gets the attention it deserves in a post-Inconvenient Truth world."
2,"The modern ""Faces Of Death""",Watching this was very depressing. Everything that has gone wrong in this world. Too much to think about and worry about. It is a chain reaction that will not stop.
1,Proven fabrication,"Pure propaganda piece in the tradition of An Inconvenient Truth. The planet has not gotten warmer in each of the past 16 years. This is just more anti-human, guilt-tripping, statistics manipulation with bad narration."
5,The Anne Frank Of Hungary,"Eva Heyman was like Anne in many ways: A budding teenager, spirited and observant of the world around her. Anne and Eva both began diaries when they were thirteen. Tragically, both did not survive the war. Like Anne, only one of Eva's parents survived the Holocaust, her mother Agnes, but out of guilt for not attempting to save her daughter's life she committed suicide in 1949. Read this book."
5,Really happy with this keyboard,Folds up relatively small. Works great. I often type homework stuff or talk online/ post stuff on the internet from my palm so this really speeds things up. Really like that you don't need to plug it in because it connects via bluetooth to the palm. Definitely a good investment if you plan to write anything more than a sentence.
2,A toy --- not like a real keyboard,"I wish I could get an infrared keyboard for my Tungsten, with a layout like my old Targus Stowaway keyboard for the Handpsring Visor. The keys on the PalmOne 3169WW are just small enough, and just non-standard enough that I have to concentrate on how I am typing, rather than on *what* I am typing. My fingers are squeezed together, I keep hitting the hinge instead of the space bar, and I keep hitting ""scroll up"" where the question mark key normally is.The 3169WW is technically a keyboard, and my words per minute are certainly faster than drawing graffitti. But I cannot type the same as I can on a regular keyboard, as I could with my old Stowaway."
1,Who designed this rubbish?,"This keyboard is a totally unstable design, you cannot use on your knee or anything moving, otherwise the Handset will topple over. Software installation was a no-go, and when it was finally installed, a succession of fatal errors led me to junk the whole thing. Just waiting for the pins on the T5 connector to bend or snap, and no integrated USB power.Whoever designed this contraption failed to consider basic ergonomics, and how the Palm is used on the move.Used to have the Palm IIIc and keyboard. Loved it. Stable platform, easy to use, reliable, strong connector, and great for rapid note taking. Replaced it with a T5. Progress?"
2,Worked at first,"After I got it set up with my Palm T|X, it worked fine the first 2 times I needed to use it. Now it doesn't. I'll continue fiddling with it and hope for the best."
5,Palm Wireless Keyboard,Great product. I have had wireless keyboards in the past and this is by far the easiest to use.
3,"Good, not Great","The Treo keyboard folds into a great package, it's easy to type on and works without problems (on my 650). Doesn't hold the 650 well (seems awkward) and I wish it just connected directly--ie through the plug. The infrared works well though."
2,"This keyboard is a great idea, but has some problems.","I bought this keyboard in hopes of turning a PDA into a laptop without all the hassles and size. The problem is that this keyboard is hard to open and the keys stick sometimes. Not to mention, I have big fingers and the keys are too small to punch. So think about these problems before you purchase this keyboard. It earned two stars in hopes that Palm will improve this product."
5,Palm keyboard,The keyboard works perfectly. My wife uses it to keep track of her office's calendar on her Palm Tungsten E2.
4,Good Job,"I received my product earlier than expect, however I had to call the company (palm one) in order for the keyboard to operate. The company was very friendly and solved the problem quickly. Currently, the product works and makes my PDA so much more efficient. Great product."
4,Nice addition for palm,"Works almost as well as a full keyboard, although it eats batteries pretty quickly."
2,Bad connection in a Treo 650,"When you use in a Treo 650, the keyword doesn't work immediately with it. The function key are difficult to use and my native lenguage is Spanish, worst to use."
1,palmOne should be ashamed...,"I have been using the Palm IR keyboard and a Tungsten T3, but frustrated by the missing number key row. I saw this keyboard and it looked impressive. Unfortunately, I did not see the bad experiences with the driver and the ""white screen of death"", so I too experienced it. A call to the PalmOne customer service only infuriated me-poor communication skills, zero technical help other than to tell me that the Palm had to be returned to the factory. Palmone knows about this problem, and has no warning on their download page. Fortunately, I found the Palm Forum topic on how to partially disconnect the power and reset the Tungsten. After resync and reloading all apps, the Tungsten is working again, but not with the new ""Universal"" wireless keyboard. Shame on you palmone for your lapse in quality control..."
4,"Very good keyboard, just one minor complaint","The keyboard is excellent in its construction. I read some reviews before buying and I don't agree with them. I am a big guy and can type quite comfortably with it, although it is not a fullsize keyboard, it is very similar to those in ultralight laptops.My only complaint is that the international symbols are in an odd place. I am Mexican and type a lot in Spanish so I need them, but I can get used to it. This keyboard together with my Palm TX help answer quickly my email from any hotspot and write my homework for my master's degree."
2,Not Great!,"I consider myself rather technically savvy and a skeptic of reviews. However, I have had nothing but bad luck with these cheaply made keyboards. It is suppressing that Palm would brand such junk and I would not recommend this product to anyone, even if price in an option. Stay clear and go bluetooth for about 50 bucks more."
4,Great keyboard but doesn't function well with Goodlink,"Overall I love this great little keyboard. Nice big keys. I can send messages at lightning speed, that is if I'm not connected with Goodlink. The problem is addressed in a popup on the Palm Wireless Keyboard installation CD. When the data link is live on Goodlink, the keyboard is super slow. To work around the problem, you need to set Goodlink to ""work offline"". Then all works great. Supposedly the makers of Goodlink are working on fixing this problem with a future software update. Other mail, messaging is not affected and the keyboard is perfectly responsive."
1,"Good product, bad quality.","I bought this keyboard twice.Because it's very useful and convenient, but easy to break.Two keyboard, everyone have the problem about part of button(2~4) out of work after one month's using.So , Although it is useful and cheap ,but i need to buy it every month---- It is too expensive to use it long time."
1,Palm keyboard,"Keyboard did not work on my Palm TX. My Palm is about 4 yrs old and still works, but it could be that the IR no longer works."
5,5 Star,"Simple and incredible battery life, it also collapses to the size of a wallet. Price is a little steep but anything wireless is these days."
4,Great for Traveling,"I traveled to Peru with this keyboard and my Treo and was able to work on my book on the plane then throw it into my pack for the remainder of the trip. Keys seem to stick a bit a first, but once you get going, it works nicely. Better than the alternative (paper or lugging around a laptop)."
1,Avoid it with your TREO 650,"Avoid this keyboard if you have a Palm Treo 650. When you press a key there is often no response. I found this to be particularly the case if you just finish typing a sentence and pause for a couple of seconds. It seems to work fine if you don't pause (provided you get it to work). The space key and the shift key (as well as some letters such as ""a"") are particularly prone to this problem. After a brief pause sometimes I have to hit the space key 5-6 times to activate it.I read a review by someone else who has the same problem with another keyboard. Iused to own a docking keyboard from Palm for my old Palm m500, and it was extremely reliable. This one is very frustrating! I'll return it to Amazon right away.Of course it is possible that I have a lemon."
3,"Good, but not as good as what it replaced","When my Palm M505 died, I needed a replacement. The old Palm keyboard was full size and had a very nice touch; I preferred it to my regular PC keyboard. I have large hands and could use it very easily.This keyboard is sturdier but the keys are smaller. My fingers routinely hit the wrong keys. Further, the keyboard layout is non standard, putting the cursor arrows where the ? should be. When I press <shift> and intend to type a question mark, I actually press the up arrow key which highlights a line of text, which is erased by the very next key I press. After this happens several times, you wonder why this poor choice made it off the drawing board. As the keyboard is non-standard, it is a continual distraction to use it."
4,"Nice, Convenient Keyboard w/Almost Full-Size Feel","This is, overall, an excellent keyboard. Allowing the little TX to function practically as a laptop if a pretty brilliant piece of engineering. Once I figured out how to use it, it has worked flawlessly.The main thing is the almost full-size QWERTY keyboard with a very good feel. Some of the things like quotation marks are not laid out like the real thing, and this is where I take off a star in the rating.Otherwise, it does work very well. I don't see it as particularly flimsy. Is it built like a tank? No, but it's not flimsy. I got it free in an Amazon deal with the Palm TX, so I can't complain anyway, but even if I had paid the $45 that Amazon normally sells it for, I would think that it is worth it for what it allows me to do, and conveniently."
3,"Keys work great, though not ergonomically designed","I purcahsed this keyboard for use with my Palm Tx to write e-mails and documents as doing so by hand can get tedious.In its folded form, the keyboard is about the size of the PDA with case, and is completely enclosed and therefore durable enough to stuff into a backpack.Opening it is not intuitive, but after about three times, works well. The design, though, seems a bit flimsy and awkward. The back support for the PDA is at an angle that is too deep for proper viewing when set on a table. The infrared light is set on a flimsy beam that must be bent in order to rotate. The PDA also does not fit tightly into the support. The keyboard is also impossible to use on a lap.The keyboard, though, is a good size and if on a table, is easy to use. All of the keys of a full-sized one are available. There is sufficient tactile feedback. It serves its function as a keyboard, but a better design is required."
1,"Didn't work with my T3, even with the latest drivers. 3-1-05","I returned it. VERY nice, full keyboard, if it works with your handheld or phone. Though it worked, somewhat, with my T3, the ""keyboard"" program installed on my T3 couldn't be used/customized, and the driver may have corrupted my T3, forcing me to do a ""hard reset"", deleting all info on my T3. It didn't actually damage my T3, though, as earlier posters noted, using the earlier/shipped driver that came with the keyboard on the install CD.I think I'll go with a Think Outside brand, ""Stowaway"" keyboard."
1,HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I hope that when I can figure out how to install this hardware on my Palm I will be happy with it. So far, all the help, hints, and suggestions don't work. If someone knows a secret to this TELL ME PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Palm 3169WW Universal Wireless Keyboard,"It is a really useful item, though its configuration to Spanish may be tricky. The item was recieved sonner than expected and it has been working fine."
4,"Great keyboard, quick setup","The keyboard worked flawlessly out of the box. Pop the CD in your laptop and let it set up the drivers. Then sync. Now you can use your keyboard.Bring along some spare batteries, because they will run out when you least expect it."
2,Not ready for prime time keyboard,"Perhaps if I had loads of time to fiddle with it, I could get this keyboard to work reliably. But since I'm someone who would rather plug and play and work, so far it looks like a waste of money. I cannot get the keyboard to connect reliably to my Palm T|X. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and I can't make rhyme nor reason as to why. Maybe if I spent a few hours on some discussion group or tried a customer service hotline to India and stayed on hold for a day or two. At any rate, I can't recommend it unless you just love to tinker and search the discussion groups for esoteric fixes for software and hardware that should work out of the box, especially for the prices demanded."
4,Very useful gadget from olden days,"I've had one of these for years, but haven't been able to use it since my last Palm PDA died. It's a great little keyboard with an ingenious design. Now if only I could figure out how to get it to work with my new Android tablet, I'd be happy as Larry...It's too bad IR connections have gone the way of the dinosaur."
4,Keyboard,This little keyboard is a big help in entering info on the Palm PDA that I have. It beats the heck out of a virtual keyboard. The price of this quality unit was very good.
1,PalmOne 3169WW Universal Keyborad,Product does not function as I had hoped. It's difficult to set up and even after many attempts does not work. I am sorry I spent the money.
4,Palm TX wireless keyboard.,This keyboard makes using the Palm TX a breeze. It works great and allows use in both landscape and portrait mode. Great keyboard. I wish all devices I bought for the TX worked this good.
3,Can't get it to work,"It might be wonderful. I can't find out. The driver software from an earlier keyboard will not allow itself to leave my Palm Tungsten E2, so the driver for this keyboard cannot load. I downloaded FileZ file-management software to get rid of the earlier driver, but FileZ reports that it can't delete the older file while it still contains data (?!?) Anyone have any suggestions?"
4,Morrisey goes Visual...,"The Smith's were one of the 80's most provocative bands. Steve Morrisey's departure into solo proves both musically powerful and visually appealing. Morrisey's ""Hulmerist"" is indeed fun to watch.Favorite Morrisey songs such as ""Last of the International Playboys,"" ""Ouija Board,"" and ""Interesting Drug"" are on here. They show Morrisey much the romantic that is not readily evident on his music. Too, his selection of Directors is quite noteworthy. Unlike the modern glamourboy images so prevelent on MTV, Morrisey looks very common as his followers. The fan footage, though sometimes drawn-out, shows his appeal in the UK.Clearly this video is an excellent buy for those who enjoyed Morrisey's earlier solo days. What better than to see it on your TV!"
5,And I was there....,"Finally found this vid... lost my copy years ago which was v annoying as I'm in the video!!!.. the live stuff was filmed at Wolverhampton Civic Hall (nr Birmingham UK).. queued for about 9 hrs to get in, the gig was free is you wore a Smiths t-shirt. Can't rememeber which tune it is, but the camera zooms right in on my face.. my only claim to fame.. apart from touching Morrissey's foot during the performance!!... outstanding stuff..."
5,Morrissey Lives......................,This Dvd is awesome I ordered from amazon because it was never released in the united states only in the uk.I love the video ouiji board which did not appear on the oye esteban collection I Highly Recommend this dvd To True Morrissey Fans. Because Morrissey is probrably the best singer other than David Bowie to ever egxist. Which is more than I could say about this corrupt music industry which seems to be releasing junk..........
2,meh.,"I must say, I was extremely disappointed when I brought this home and fired it up. The graphics are bad, the control setup is awkward at best, the cutscenes look horrible, and, above all, it's SHORT. I beat it in about four or five hours. I admit, it was kind of fun throwing chairs around and shooting webs ('kind of' being the key phrase), but it's nowhere near fun enough to make up for the rest of the game. It's cheap, but I wouldn't even pay five dollars for this. Don't waste your money.By the way, I'm 17, but I don't have an account so I had to use the kids thing."
1,This CD is not what you are expecting...,"I was really disapointed when I got this CD home...this does not have the radio version on it...sadly. That is the reason that I bought it...and it is not on there...in fact the only versions are a dance version (which is OK) and then the horrible rap version....that is really bad....and I really think this is a waste of your precious hard earned money. Don't waste your gas money, don't waste the money to buy it, don't waste the time and energy to pick the CD up, don't waste the energy it takes""~ to scroll down and read all of these reviews. This CD is bad news...but if she had put the radio version n here instead of the rap version, it would be a four start CD. The rap song brought it way, way, way, way, way down in terms of review points!"
4,good,"Tha best track? tha damizz remix wit Krayzie Bone and Da Brat, that remix can kick tha original song's bootaaay! i give all that to mariah, krayzie and da brat"
5,Believe in Mariah,"This single is awesome! Although she is collaborating too much, and prefer her old image instead of her new image. But she still sings beautifully, as usual."
5,Excellent and Top-Notch! A Must For Any Jaguar Enthusiast!,"This book is expertly written by Ian Cooling and the collectibles are superbly photographed by James Mann. It details the fascinating memoribilia and factory-issued artifacts that paralleled the growth of one of the most successful British car makers of this century. From the early Swallow beginnings to the XJ220 and XK8, the book explores brochures, racing automobilia, posters & advertising, models, mascots, and badges. I see something new everytime I open the book...and you don't have to be a Jaguar owner or enthusuast to enjoy it. One of the favorites in my Jaguar library."
4,GOOD read. Lots of strong ideas to take away with you.,Very well written DNA-punk novel. Compelling plot with some good irony and socially interesting ideas. Just enough science to inform and lets your imagination fill in the gaps. Good charcter development that doesn't get in the way of the plot. I read it twice about a month apart and enjoyed it equally both times. Lots of good ideas to explore with your mind expand after the book is closed
2,"I like it, but it's missing alot of pieces","Yes, in the future you can look like Madonna or Elvis. But why would you step on a subway train with five Elvis' sitting around? How do people tell each other apart? And would you want to look like Elvis if thousands of people already do? These are some of the obvious questions this book overlooks. There's more. The picture of the future is interesting, but foolishly described. The flow of the book is sporadic and I get the feeling the author isn't well versed in biology or genetics to give compelling details of the books creations. I would suspect Junior High boys would love this story. Much of it made me think of storylines explored in the Ninja Turtles cartoons! Cowabunga, Mr. Young!"
2,Great lens... for the short time it lasted,"Loved this lens when it worked... however now, only one year later, this lens doesn't work! Short circuits new Nikon D90 camera and won't AF on D50. I can't afford to be buying a new $500 lens on a yearly basis - I'm extremely disappointed in Sigma's longevity."
5,Good lens for the price,"This lens has proven to be a good ""all terrain"" lens, so is the only one I am carrying right now.The only possible concern is the lack of OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) but so far so good.I am putting my 18-55 to rest for a long while...For the money I think there is no better option."
4,Outstanding lens,Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. She loved it and the lens performed exceptionally well. Great lens at a fantastic price. Highly recommended it.
4,Worth the price!,"I just received this lens today and I already went out to shoot. I love the lens. I am a hobbyist so I just shoot for a hobby. I am very pleased with this lens. Reading numerous reviews, it was said that this lens was very slow, however in my opinion it works just great. It feels solid in my hands and it's pretty comfortable. Very easy to use, but it's pretty heavy. I ordered and asked for 2 day shipping. Ordered on the 21st of September and got in the next day afternoon. Faster than I asked for. Bottom line, very good purchase, and I would recommend this lens to other hobby photographers."
5,Easy for a beginner to use,"I am very new to digital SLR photography, and I got this lens just a few days before going on a trip overseas. Even with virtually no practice with this lens and little experience with SLRs at all, I ended up getting really great pictures. The zoom was powerful (for the money) and it also gave me good detail and texture shots close up. I brought another lens on the trip, but after the second day it stayed in the hotel and I used this one exclusively. It was easy to learn and simple to use right away, and I'm looking forward to learning more about its capabilities as I gain more experience with SLR photography. It was a fantastic purchase for me, and I'd get it again with no hesitation."
4,"Use it, love it.","I recently took the lens to the mountains of West Virginia and loved the results. In river humidity, summer heat, waterfall rain...it performed flawlessly and the photo results were excellent. I have not used a more expensive version of this type lens but for my use, rough treatment, hiking ...I would certainly say ""get it, use it, love it."""
3,not very impressive,"my review is so so.. picture quality is not very impressive when you zoom the lens. at 200, its very blur and not satisfactory. at low zoom it is good. I would go for nikon lens by paying more money to get the good quality photo."
3,Not without flash,"Limited use, but for my preference for non flash photography this cannot cut it indoors. Yes, I need a faster lens but don't have $1,000."
2,Hate it,"Its a ok travel lens, and there are better travel lenses out there (Sony 18-250mm). Avoid this one at all costs.."
1,You get what you pay for,"Yes, it is better than a cell phone camera. And no, it is not good enough for DSLR - there are better choices."
4,SIGMA 18-200,The picture quality is good... the vividness is not so good.... The control for apareture and shutter is very easy with Nikon D40..... I am using it for quite some time.... and the performance is good..... Its a good buy....
4,Pleased overall with lens,"I was looking for a good all-in-one lens and the Sigma 18-200 has met my expectations. Picture quality has been very good. The lens also seems to be built very well. My only complaint is that it takes a bit longer to focus, especially in low light circumstances. However, I have only compared it to the stock 18-55 that came with my camera."
4,Very good walk-around lens,"I've had this lens for about 9 months and have shot thousands of photos with it. It's really a great lens for a frequent traveler like me. I keep it on the camera and toss it in my computer bag and go. The very wide zoom range is ideal for everything from group shots to shooting sports from the stands. For this capability and price, it does have some drawbacks, of course. It's rather slow, and therefore not well suited to shooting intimate gatherings at night or dimly-lit museum exhibits; you'll have to crank up the ISO to 1600 to get decent shots. And its images are noticeably soft in the middle range. (Get a $75 Canon 50mm f1.8 ""plastic fantastic"" and compare.) I'm preparing to give this lens to my niece and upgrade to either the OS version (optical stabilization) or maybe the Canon 17-55mm f2.8 IS (image stabilization) and a long lens, which would be much more expensive and less convenient. This Sigma is hard to beat."
3,sigma dc lens,"the quality of this lens seemed to be good for the price but i was not happy with the image and sharpness in my pictures.I returned the lens for the canon L f.4 70-200mm,non is model.This lens is the ticket in the 600.00 price range,no complaints what so ever.If you want clear results,spend the extra money."
2,Returned and like the Tamron pzd more,The sigma is a great price but I found it well worth paying extra for the optical stabilization of the Tamron pzd. This sigma is great if you do mostly tripod work but I missed many great photos since they were blurry when hand held especially inside or shutter speed less than 1/60.
1,Does not fit Samsung DSLR,"The product description on this site is a lie. Nothing on the product packaging or manual suggests that it will fit a Samsung Digital SLR camera, and in fact the lens does NOT fit my Samsung NX10 DSLR camera."
4,Pretty good lens for the $.,"This lens works pretty good with my Nikon D40 and I have made great shots using it.After about a year of use I got no complaints and would buy it again in a heart beat.Note: there is some lens creep but not terrible, the the OS makes an audible chirp sound and the auto-focus motor makes a very high pitched sound that's a audible too (not as much as the OS tho), but it's not that bad and I can easily live with this."
4,Great fit for Nikon D40 with seldom focus glitches,"I had a Nikon D40 with the standard 15-55mm lens. Felt the need for a lens with a higher optical zoom. Nikon lenses are more expensive and because I am not a professional photographer I bought the Sigma lens. Since then I haven't attached the standard 15-55mm Nikon lens. This is the perfect companion to my Nikon D40 for casual photographs for a casual traveller. Nearby subjects or faraway mountains, birds etc I don't need to change the lens. Have been using it for now more than 3 years without any issues.The only minor annoyance is that sometimes the lens and camera will take a few seconds to adjust. I have to press the click button 2-3 times on very rare occasions for a photograph to be taken. During this time there will be some camera noise since the motor will be moving trying to adjust."
5,Great for not having to switch out lenses all the time!,"I bought this lens for my new Nikon D7000. I haven't got to use it very much yet but so far I'm very happy with all the photos taken. The lens is very easy to use and isn't to noisy. It is a little on the heavy side, but that does not seem to be a problem or disadvantage so far. All in all I think it's a great lens to have for convenience."
3,3.5 Stars might be more accurate,"First impressions after having the lens for 1 week, using with the Nikon D200 (upgraded from Nikon 24-120mm VR):1. It is loud. When auto focusing or engaging the OS function, the lens makes a chirp sound. Doesn't really matter from a performance perspective, but it is annoying.2. Auto focus in the dark takes longer than the 24-120mm Nikon. Not sure if this is the camera or the lens, but the lens just doesn't seem happy to do the nighttime auto focus.3. Range is amazing. From full tele to full zoom, the photos look great.4. OS stabilization seems to work just as well as the Nikon 24-120mm VR's did.4. For just over 1/2 the price of the Nikon 18-200 VR, no matter how much quieter/faster the Nikon is, this seems like the better value for the buck."
3,THE 'one and only' travelling lens.,3 stars because of:1) soft corners at 18mm (f3.5)2) vignetting at 18mm (f3.5)3) lens creep (self extension of lens barrel while walking) if not retracted/lock at 18mmThis lens has the most useful range one can possibly have. It has become my only lens for short travelling trip when I don't want hassel of changing lens. I took only this lens with my Canon XT to Amsterdam (5days) without missing my other lenses at all. Here are some photos taken with this lens in my website:http://www.theteh.com/html/london_street_.htmlhttp://www.theteh.com/html/croatia.htmlhttp://www.theteh.com/html/index1.htmlFor this price range (other than the Tamron 18-200) there is no other lenses that can compete!
2,Lens faults,"I purchased this lens to attach to a Nikon D-60 SLR camera. It was to be used in my many excursions with a travel/exchange group. This year we went to Turkey. At first I was satisfied with the lens but it commenced to give me camera errors that read sort of,"" Lens not fully attached to camera"". To correct I locked the lens and tightened. This happened approximately 15-20 times in an eighteen day period. Also, the lens developed numerous spots. In handlind the lens while on the camera I either put the lenscap back on, or cupped my hand over the lens to prevent burning, and was in a very dry area. I would try another one in the future if I can be assured the manufacturing and quality assurance has improved. I am NOT an expert in lens quality, but believe this particular lens is and was faulty."
2,Enter title here...,"Ok so I got this lens due to the zoom range. Its a great range to have one lens mounted on your camera the majority of the time. That would be nice if the lens would produce decent sharp pictures. I shoot outdoors all of the time in Phoenix AZ. For those of you who are not familiar with Phoenix it is a desert here. Never a lack of sunshine no matter what the season is. With that in mind I never have my shutter speed below 1/250. For a while I thought it was my camera hinting to me that it was time for an upgrade. I then tested my camera with my crap kit lens 18-55mm. To make the test fair I turned off IS and set the shutter to 1/250. Perfectly sharp picture, unlike the sigma. Glad to note that the Sigma 18-200 was promptly returned."
2,"Good looking, not a performer","I'm not sure if the lens that I got was just defective or representative of the product as a whole. I will say that this lens is in the process of being returned and replaced with another brand. It was nice to think that one lens would answer all of my needs but there is a reason to go with a DSLR and that is the ability to change lenses for varying circumstances. This lens performed average at most focal lengths but as I approached 200mm the quality dropped off to a very unsatisfactory level. I will put in a plug for Amazon, they worked with me to return the product within their return policy so when I ordered another lens I went back to Amazon."
3,"Pretty good, be careful with soft focus. I expected more.","I have a Nikon D-80 and somehow it's pretty hard to get the right focus. Also, If I set the focus in TELE and pull back to wide angle or midle range, the focus vary :( . Sometimes you cannot tell by looking in the camrea's screen but when you have it in the computer you see the no focus picture. I expected more from this lense."
1,Not for full-frame camera,"I cannot properly rate this lens since I only took 2 photos with it before returning it. I gave it one star because this lens cannot be used with a full-frame camera. If you intend to use this with a crop sensor, stop here and read another review.The two photos I took with this lens (on my 5D Mark II body) were at 18mm and 200mm. At 18mm, you could only see about 2/3 of the image. The rest was black and blocked by the lens. Even at 200mm there was a lot of vignetting.Basically, if you ever wanted to use this lens on a full-frame camera, don't."
4,Very Nice LEns but the AUto focus,It the perfect lens for an amature photographer. It is ten time better than the regular one except that the autofocus is not working somehow for a D3000 Nikon. Its zoom is very good and it is not that expensive and was shipped to me earlier for time and very good.Perfect lens for people whol love details
3,Sigma and Canon -Bad Combo,"In 25 years of using many cameras and lenses it always seems that Sigmaand Canon have issues when paired together, this lens is no exception.The Sigma electronics on this and the 18-125mm DC have problems focusing accurately at most focal lengths on Canon bodies. Especially at 18mm forget even trying, instead you must zoom first and then zoom back out. The 18-200mm can be sharp at 18mm IF you get the correct sample (Some are terrible, bad quality control) AND you get the correct focus. The lens is sharp enough up to about 80mm, beyond that it becomes quite soft.If you take the chance on one Look for a cheap one branded under Quantaray on Ebay, you can pick one up for around $100-$115. The lens really isn't worth any more than that."
3,A good book but kind of slow by Callum Cotter aged 10,"The Wheel on the School is has a great message about how people working together and never giving up can get things done, but it's a bit hard to read and has no action."
3,Ok but not an adventure. By Lucy O'Driscoll,"The Wheel on the School had a great message,that if everybody sticks together then we can do great things.But unfortunately that message was brought to us very slowly and with no adventure.I think it is a good learning opportunity."
3,Bedtime treasure,"I am almost finished reading this to my two children as a bedtime story. The gentle and yet human and humerous characters and events depicted have led to some wonderful late night realizations and conversations. I am so happy this book has found it's way into my famiy's life and my children's memories. We are reading an edition from the library, have had to renew it and feel like it should become a fixture on our bookself. I preread it before reading it aloud and am sad that our family time with it is almost over."
3,Why don't the storks come to Shora?,"I read this book because: 1) It was Dutch 2) It had a wildlife component. The book moves rather slowly compared to contemporary children's books. However, it does cover themes like learning, imagination, co-operation vs. rivalry, and how you can go beyond the limitations you have set yourself in your mind. What really impressed me was that unlike contemporary children's books, childhood nastiness, feelings of hatred, dislike, envy, guilt and shame are incorporated into the story in quite a bitter form. No beating around the bush or dodging the issue. However, I cannot say I was rivited by the book."
4,The scientific method in action!,"I was assigned to read this in college... in order to study the scientific method and how it applies to elementary schools.Indeed, science is a strong theme in this story, but what totally got me was the idea of a village coming together for a dream (so sue me, I'm a sucker for those kinds of stories).Here we have a class of kids who decided they want to bring storks to their village. Because we all want giant birds lying around on our roofs. But why aren't their storks? How can they get the storks to come?This turns from a theoretical experiment into an exciting and touching adventure to make a dream come true.Adorable and great literature indeed."
5,Timeless and Thrilling Tale,"A tale all children should read once they have mastered chapter books. Although written in the 1950's it remains a timeless and perfect lesson of good family, friends, and community relationships, plus the respect for nature. It has thrilling and suspensful events which hold your attention through the 298 pages. Most of all, the story is filled with love and happiness."
4,"Interesting , very interesting",The wheel on the school is a story that would make me and my friends to work together. It is about 6 children from a fishing village called Shora. A girl called Lina starts the adventure with a little piece about storks and that's when the fun begins. I especially liked the bit where Jells tries to get the wheel from a farmer and then the farmer sees him and ow. that is one sore ear for Jella!
2,Seems pretty simplistic,"I bought this dictionary as a gift, choosing this one because of it's ""pocket"" size feature and being quite cheap.After receiving it, I was very surprised at how simplistic this book is, and is quite big for being ""pocket size"". I have a different brand of pocket dictionary of another foreign language that is quite small and use very religiously. This Tagalog one pales in comparison to what I used and what I was expecting.There are no pronuciation explanations, as I guess they assume you know how to pronounce the words already. But then again, reading Tagalog is pretty straightfoward, as opposed to trying to read, say, Chinese or Russian, where the characters are totally different. But you wouldn't even know where to accent the syllables either...A total for 88 pages with 44 pages devoted to each Tagalog - English, and English - Tagalog. I guess you get what you pay for. And I'm not paying this much for this book. I'm returning this one!"
1,Not what I expected from the title,"I found the title, ""23 Race Routes to Ride Yourself"", misleading. My hope was to find detailed maps so that I could find these routes myself and ride them at my convenience. Instead, the content is mainly a description of scheduled cyclo-tourist events on these courses with the only route detail being a single page map of the courses which offers no route markings or numbers. The only way to find the actual course would be to overlay the book maps onto real Michelin maps and hope you could duplicate the route.I think a better way to find the Tour of Flanders route (for example) would be to take a good map into local racing shops and ask for help. The $20 I save by returning this book will pay for at least a few decent maps."
3,"uh, well it was ok..","It was ok.. I like aspects of the story but I feel that you really arent getting the engame that one would expect after Origin. The art is good, not great.. doesnt suck you in and add anything to the story. I would buy something else but it is supposed to be the end.. Wish it would have been better. I'd give it a C."
2,Not very good,This one was not very good. boring. You don't learn very much more about Wolverine and what you do learn is not very interesting.
1,Did not live up to the hype or hope!,"This was a really, really dissapointing novella. The ending is awful, totally anti-climatic and without meaning. The great contribution to Wolverine as a character is finding out he has a brother and the secret the specter of Xavier makes vague reference to. To make it all even worse, the promise of ""the end"" isn't even fulfilled. Very, very poor. Let's hope this is the beginning of a phoenix moment for Logan."
2,Wolverine-The End...More like..Teh_Suxx,"I am a die hard Wolverine fan (yeah yeah, get in line) but im sorry, this whole story line was a dissapointment. I don't consider myself an expert in writing, but as far as art goes, I know my share, and this is probalby one of the least moving art layouts used to sell logans story and reviewed well. (I'm discluding some of the real old bootleg ones with some scary and lame art of Logan)Anyway, the story is based on the plot from Origins (one of my favorites) and it seems like there is no support in the story line! Its just so farfetched and obsurd. The character of Wolverine isn't represented well either. It has some good classing Logan one liners, but they aren't anything I would put on a bumbersticker. I would have given this 1 star, but I still love Marvel, and more so Wolverine. Why did I ever read this../wheep"
2,Stick to the middle years,"Leaping from the alpha of Logan's life to the omega, Paul Jenkins (of questionable ""Origin"" fame) decided to use Marvel's ""The End"" series (a sort of ""how did they die""/What If? occasional series) to cap Wolverine's life and, in the process, further seal the hero's storyline. Logan is now old, having outlived his X-friends by a century or so; his mutant healing factor is starting to fail but he continues to seek the answers to his identity that we regretfully learned in Jenkins' previous outing. Suddenly, Wolverine has a brother who knows all the answers and teases Logan with them -- but only if he assists in a scheme to wreak havoc on humankind. Ugh.Coupled this time with muddy, unexciting art by Claudio Castellini, ""The End"" seems to say that Logan's life must both begin and end with a fizzle. If you like Wolverine, do yourself a favor and stick with the stories in the middle.by Tom Knapp, Rambles editor"
3,"Wolverine: The End...no, not really","Most of my knowledge of Wolverine has been from the movies/cartoons, back issues of the X-Men comics and crossovers. I recently purchased Wolverin: Origin and was very impressed with it. So naturally I wanted to see how his story ends (since I just read the begining) well, needless to say I was very disappointed. This book can be the first arc of his ending, but it is not THE END. Many more books can be written about Wolverine after this story arc. That was my biggest disappointment. Other than that, the story was okay."
3,"Not quite ""The End"" at all","Paul Jenkins, who scripted Marvel's hit Origin, provides a fascinating follow up with Wolverine: The End. This time under the banner of Marvel's popular ""The End"" series, this 6 issue TPB begins with a much older Wolverine receiving word of the death of his life long arch nemesis Sabretooth. Soon enough, Logan is face to face with his long lost brother John, resulting in a confusing and bloody battle which doesn't quite end anything at all. Jenkins, who is one of the best writers in comics today, leaves more questions than answers, whether that was his intention or not is unknown. Wolverine: The End's main weakness however are the pencils of Claudio Castellini, which seem to break down as the story progresses. That aside, the TPB still manages to be an average comic at best, but for those hoping for some closure, you won't find it here."
2,The End? I hope not,"The artwork in the book is great, but the story was really blah. Origin was great, I dont like how this doesnt tie up all the loose ends either. Pass on this one, Wolverine fans."
2,Just So So,"Since this comic has been reviewed so many times I 'll just said that it was dissapointing. Not only for the coloring but mostly for the story. Just so unbelievable even for a comic book. It doesn't make sense that the brother decide to show up after more that 150 years. He tells wolverine that he has always been watching/following him. Then he beats him up so badly that Wolverine almost die and shortly after he offers him to be partners? Ha,ha"
2,Not good,"I too, will join the ranks of protestors against ""Wolverine: The End"". I actually like the idea of an old Logan, following his final years, but this publication is simply not up too par. The story (picking up the ""Origin"" trail) is, too put it bluntly, bad. The amount of actual information given about Wolverine is next to nothing, no explanations are given, no insights. The plot is very weak and boring, bringing in a two-dimensional main antagonist in the shape of Logans brother and generally following a far too well known pattern.The artwork is not the best I've seen, yet I don't find it as bad as many other reviewers seem to.There's nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing plausible, nothing. A cup of thin broth. One for the completists."
4,"Great, uplifting debut","I bought this CD a while ago after hearing ""Cross the Line"" on the radio and have not regretted doing so. The genre is along the lines of Christian (strong emphasis on the Christian) pop/rock. The singer (Dustin Ruth) has a great voice and seems to have passion for what he does. The band definitely has talent, and the songs are quite catchy. I took half of a star away from my final score because some of the lyrics are a bit bland at times and could have been improved upon (though this is not too detrimental a problem). I took the other half of a star away because a little after half-way through the album, the songs start to slow down and seem kind of repetitive. Still, Ruth has created a debut album that is worth looking into, particularly if you are looking for Christian-based, uplifting pop/rock music."
5,A very tasty chip!,"These chips are crisp, tangy and a nice change from barbecue flavor chips. If you like spicy foods, you'll love these. The blue cheese is not at all overwhelming, just adds that extra ""bite."" The box of chips arrived well packed, nothing broken, and the expiration date was over 3 months in advance, making this a very good value, considering the 20% discount Amazon had during November."
5,Best pepper chips out there!,"Love love love these! They are well seasoned, thick and greasy. Yum! They have so much flavor. No other pepper chip compares."
5,Best chips ever,"These are probably the best-tasting potato chips ever. Chips certainly aren't the healthiest snack food out there, but at least these don't have any trans fats."
5,Great chips,"Got a nice tang, As far as blue cheese flaver, its so mild that people that hate blue cheese will still eat these and like em as long as they dont know. >=)"
2,Most of the Bags were open,"I've eaten these Krinkle Cut Salt and Pepper Chips for years. I was very excited to find them on Amazon. I bought the 24 pack specifically so they would be fresh every time I opened them (opposed to buying an 8 or 12 oz larger bag).When I went to get a bag this evening, I noticed they were slightly open and the chips were stale. I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open. I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips. They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude. The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier. Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now? I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season. Hopefully this was just a cranky CSR and not indicative of Amazon's direction for customer service."
2,great product but stop raising the price...,"I like these chips a lot. They're very crunchy and the salt/pepper taste is great. However, like most everything else here on amazon as of late, the prices are going up and up and up.I was paying 23.20 for subscribe and save...now it's about 26.50. Soon, these chips will be as much as getting them in the store and that is a shame.I have been a very loyal amazon prime member for some time. It's really a shame to see all the prices going up...Besides that, these chips are great...just wish they kept them at the price they were at...."
2,OK but not great,"First off the krinkle cut chips are far inferior to the regular style kettle chips in my opinion. Secondly, the flavor doesn't really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese. They taste kinda weird. It's probably not the best type of flavor to put on a potato chip, even though I love wings."
3,Meh...,"The Buffalo Bleu flavor isn't that great, at least to me. It is a sort of barbeque flavor with a hint of tang. I prefer the salt and ground pepper flavor, much more tasty."
5,"These are great-nice texture, really crispy. Super treat. Worth the calories!","I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good. The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ ! They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know. They are much more flavorful. Never had this flavor before. before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!These arrived in a case of individually wrapped chips. Each one was in great shape. No open or broken bags. No mess, no crumbs.If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!"
4,"Great product, terrible packaging...beware...","No complaints about the chips, they're great. However the box arrived from UPS half open and when I opened it completely, I found one chip bag had exploded and all the other 23 bags were crushed or semi-crushed. So much for that! Not blaming Amazon or UPS but next time this happens, I will return the order."
5,Great chips,"Hi:I bought a 24 pack of these 2 ounce bags (size you would get at Quiznos or Subway with a sandwich) since they were less than I could get them at Costco in a equal pack of Frito chips. I had tried previously by buying a bag at my local Albertsons and they are good. Good chip for dipping sicne they're a little thicker than Lays. The chips are fresh, crisp and great tasting; perfect for putting a bag lunch for work or school.NOTE: Bags are made extra thick paper with a plastic lining for freshness and very difficult to open by hand. Use a knife or scissors."
1,Where is the blue cheese??,"These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips. Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again. I really love blue cheese, but I can't taste it in these chips. I should never buy anything I haven't tried, and now I'm stuck with all these bags of chips that I don't like. I have tried the salt and cracked pepper flavor and wish I had bought them instead."
1,A little stale,"I usually love these, but somehow, on arrival, they were actually a little stale.. although the dates were good.. I would not buy them again through Amazon.. We could still eat them, but when I have bought them in the store before, they were nice and crisp.??"
1,Check the label,"The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are ""All Natural"" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain ""yeast extract."" On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with ""NO MSG,"" but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer."
2,Powerful punch,"Wow, these chips bite back. I loves me some salt and pepper potato chips, but these have little bit too much spice for my liking. Also, the portion is a little too much. If you like spice, then dive in."
1,Beware!,"I opened a bag of these and poured them into a bowl. One of the chips on top had something black on it. It looked like black tar or melted black crayon. I assumed it was a contaminant of some sort, since it didn't resemble any kind of food ingredient. I wish I had not bought these chips. I am now wary of all Kettle products."
1,KETTLE CHIPS -- DISAPPOINTINF,I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORSSALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPERTUSCAN 3 CHEESEN.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERSTHEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME. IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
5,My Horizontal Life by Chelsea Handler,This book is hilarious! I laughed the whole way through and couldn't wait to pick it up again. Read if you love a good laugh.
1,Utter Crap,"Pure garbage. I was forced to read this by my liberal Sociology Professor at the University of Washington. . Give this book a read if you are a proponent of gratuitous sex for the sake of sex itself and with no fear of the sociological or health ramifications. The author brags that she cannot remember the number of sexual partners she has had and that, quite frankly, is a laudable goal if you truly want to be ""sexually free"". The author is basically a spun out drunken whore who has issues with her daddy and is striking out as a result. Poorly written and even more poorly edited. Clearly rushed into publication to take advantage of Gen-X's hunger for popular culture with the word sex in it. Utter crap."
5,Too funny,Made me think back on my youth. Tremendously funny.Must read for women of experience. Could not stop reading.Thanks Chelsea.
2,Humor just seems condescending...,"Not a great read. This book and its humor is very self-absorbed, with little redeeming messaging. It revolves around a consistent condescending attitude and lifestyle. Some humorous moments, but the humor is never self-deprecating and only seems to be mean-spirited. Not my thing. (Also, the voice on the audio book version is not a good match.)"
3,Funny,"Most parts are really funny in this book. I was wondering about some parts, because they don't seem plausible, but alas, it's Chelsea Handler, so anything is possible. I liked the fact that she wrote this without any qualms about her sexual escapades, or lack thereof in some cases, and found that candor refreshing. I have always liked Ms. Handler in terms of her sense of humor, her writing is decent enough, and it was a quick read."
2,It was ok,Got old after a while. Not too much of a fan of this one. He other was great and a recommended read!
3,"Funny book, great easy read","This book was a very easy read. I enjoyed the book. I would recommend it, just not to any young people. Haha"
3,Funny but...,"I found the book to be rather amusing. However, towards the end of the book, it became quite dull and not as entertaining. It was a decent read, overall."
3,My horizontal life,"Funny, fast read, she's the R rated lucy. The ending left you hanging for more. Might look up herOther books."
1,offensive,"I don't take issue with a raunchy sex story. I don't take issue with a little off-color humor IF it's well done (example: the Simpsons). what I do not like is the blatant racism in this book. this book was offensive, boring and not at all funny. she sounds like a dumb teenager bragging about her exploits, all the while she manages to insult Asians, African Americans, and little people. I pretty much stopped reading after that, so who knows who else she managed to insult."
4,Love it!!,These are some great stories. I have LOL at almost all stories because she knows how to tell stories and the little details that MAKE each story funny!!
1,Awful,I have only read 25% of this book and would never purchase it again. Juvenile is the word that comes to mind. Or mindless. A total waste of time and money.
3,Meh,"It would agree with another reviewer that this is a nice vacation-type read. It moves quickly and the chapters aren't very long. I would describe this book as a collection of short stories about Chelsea's sexual conquests (and failures). If you don't know the type of personality that she has then you're in for a big surprise. There were only a few times that I laughed out loud. Most of the time I just thought to myself, ""What a slut"". The book is okay for what it does. If you don't read it, you're not missing much."
1,My boring life,"This was so shallow and boring! Basically, this is just a series of sexual encounters punctuated with alcohol and drugs. Oh. La. Ti. Da.Basically,the action is predictable beyond predictable. The main character, a woman, screws a random guy on a one-night stand. She drinks. She screws some more men. She drinks some more. The resolution? In a tantrum because the guy she picked for the one-night stand of the moment has had so much cocaine he can't get an erection, she decides she's going to ""take a break"" from casual sex and hunt for a husband. Fifties throwback much? Ick.I kept thinking there was some emergence story coming out of this, as in stuff like, ""Crank"" and the other Hopkins' books, or even a struggle story. No such luck. She may have a TV show worth watching, but this book is NOT worth reading, free or not.Don't waste the space on your Kindle nor on your bookshelf. You will regret it. I promise."
1,Female Tucker Max wannabe,"The book was recomended to me by a friend so eventhough I was not really too convinced I've decided to give it a try. And was soon sorry that I did. The language used is really basic and there's nothing really happening besides the girls sexual innuendos that are also explained on the level of a 16 yo teen experimenting with life. Nothing you'll read is any different to what you'd have heard many times before from your friends if you're not a complete prude. And as with Tucker you'll constantly have that feeling that many things were made up just so that ""different"" experiences could be put in the book.I guess the book might be interesting to people with very conservative approach to sexuality as it might speak to them on situations they didn't encounter, but it is so poorly done they'd be better off watching some erotic movies or porn."
1,A waste of time and money,"It looked like funny escapism. Turned out to be racist, often offensive (and I am not easily offended) and stupid. She isn't funny, has no insight to impart, and the book has no direction. It is just a rambling account of the people she has slept with, without even detailing the sex to make it slightly entertaining. Do not waste the time or money."
3,For the ladies...,"I love Chelsea Handler. I really do. A huge fan. However, this book is really written for the ladies. Being a gay guy I thought that maybe I could wrap my brain around the stylings of a single female who loves vodka and men. But in the end a lot of the charm and appeal is lost on me...I may love vodka and men but I'm certainly not a single female.The stories are funny though and written for a quick read. And I think most 20-30 ""somethings"" will find this quite humorous. I was hoping for more hardcore juice...but most of the time Chelsea just ran short of being a true tramp and was more like a little girl dressing up in mom's heels and make-up."
2,Waste of time,"I'm not a huge Chelsea Handler fan but was hoping that this book would give me a deeper appreciation for her style... after all, friends have raved and raved about this book and her other.I cannot believe this book was published. It is hands down the most lateral book I've ever read; no beginning, middle or end but most of all absolutely no climax. Boring.Yes, true to her comedic-ways, there were several funny lines but most of the writing seemed forced and a pathetic attempt at trying to be hilarious. Her stories were more pathetic than anything and the characters lacked depth. Her tangents were nonsensical and left me wondering whether her book was even read by publishers or simply put to press because she's achieved some level of fame.I'm kinda pissed I wasted money on this book... 2 stars is pretty generous - I'd give it a 1.25 max."
1,bad stuff!,This book is the worst ever. It should not have been published. Trash all the way and written I would guess by a 8th or 9th grader trying to be worldly!!
1,I was looking for some very light reading...but this was terrible,"I read a lot of different types of books for graduate school and research. As such, I was looking for a ""break"" and knew this would be light reading. However, I have to say this book was rather revolting. I guess the words that come to mind: sad, pathetic,lonely...What I thought was going to be humorous and maybe occasionally edgy turned out to be incredibly offensive and disgusting. I found myself incredibly grateful for my sobriety after reading this book. If it did anything, it served as a reminder of how life can be really meaningless and lonely to some. What was meant to be funny was so, so sad in reflection."
1,Where's the redemption?,"There is one thing that all memoirs should have... redemption. Or at least be so funny that it doesn't matter. This fell so far from the mark of being a good memoir. It was just - sad. I would have loved to see her end up in rehab and maybe married to someone with no sexually transmitted diseases. It was like *giggle* a story *giggle* about this *giggle* little girl *giggle* in this grown up *giggle* body - that drank entirely too much (and *giggle* thought it was funny), would find the nearest guy and go screw - maybe if his penis wasn't too big or small or whatever other problems the author seemed to have. It wasn't even that funny. What a piece of junk. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,It is no wonder....,I am not surprised that she is so into alcohol and drugs. It is a typical way to numb feelings and to escape--she admits and even jokes about her own tendency to lie a lot and to sleep with assorted men without any meaningful connection. Good luck getting a man to marry you (her stated goal) once he reads this book. Who would trust such a person? Poor girl.
2,my horizontal life,This is one of the worst books i have ever read. its a book about a woman who drinks too much and is a slut. I cant see what all the excitement is about when its a woman who sleeps with anyone with a penis and if she is missing a penis she sleeps with a bottle of Ketol One. Thats a week of my life Ill never get back.
2,disappointing,i was dispappointed by this book. at first pleased to find a sexually liberated woman. there were quite a few times i cringed through the book and i honeslty did not laugh out loud. maybe it's different while she's on stage but i don't find her funny. she even seems quite conceited. i am for the sexual liberation of women. i don't see how that fits with ruining your health with alcohol and drugs. the only good tip forone night stands is the advice to never go anywhere without your car.
2,Tucker Max is way better,"Taking out any kind of morality issues, this book is not entertaining. It's the same base plot repeated chapter after chapter. Anytime I thought a story would take a humorous twist, it just ended with her leaving the situation completely. Don't get me wrong, that's a good decision in ""reality"", but it makes a very boring book. If you want a ""sex-capade"" book that makes you laugh so hard you cry, read Tucker Max's ""I hope they serve beer in hell""."
5,Awesomeness,"As a big fan of Dave Glenn and Tucker Max's books, I was recommended this book by a friend and loved every bit of it. Finally a WOMAN who's brave enough to put a book like this together! Chelsea's hilarious writing style gives the reader an honest insight into the mind of women. And anyone out there who condemns her as shallow needs to get off their high horse and start living in reality. We all have our secret desires about sex. Chelsea simply puts it on paper and holds nothing back."
1,Garbage,"I'm sorry, this book that I was so eager to read left me very disapointed. Don't waste your time, a real piece of crap!"
2,2 stars because I laughed a couple times...,"This is just a badly written book. Some of the chapters remind me of papers I would have gotten a bad grade on in high school. The author meanders around topics to fit her jokes in, and maybe needs an editor or co-author who can help with the writing part of it.My other problem with it is... Well sure, it's trashy, I knew that going in. But it's not sexy. These experiences sound gross and embarrassing and not even a little fun. Does Chelsea like sex, or just notching the bedpost? Many of the stories are not about having sex, but about waking up not sure if she had sex, or about coming to her senses and leaving before having sex. Maybe that's part of the joke. Because this book was controversial for being about a woman who has a lot of sex. But Chelsea's life seems to be ""horizontal"" because she passed out drinking most of the time. Did anybody else notice how much drunk driving the girl must have done?"
4,Really enjoyed this book!,"Laugh out loud funny!! quick and easy fun read! she tells it like it is, and its hillarious!! i now want to meet her fsther!"
3,just ok,"Funny at times, really funny. not believable however. i It was a fun experience. only a few typos. Worth the price .."
2,It was ok,I thought I would like this book more but it was just ok for me. I won't say I did not laugh at all at any of it but most of it I just didn't. I think she was trying to hard to be funny in most of the book and it just came across like she was a drunken slut. I am not trying to judge her but the whole book is about sleeping with men (a lot of men) and drinking. Yes I read what the book was about but I still read it because it was supposed to be funny. A lot of readers did find it very funny tho and that is great we just have different taste on what humor is but I won't be buying anymore of her books.
2,Meh?,"Sigh,Chelsea isn't a terrible writer, her comedic pen is pretty good, but yeah....I guess reading about drinking until your wasted enough to take a stranger home just didn't hold my attention after the umpteenth hook up."
4,VERY FUNNY,"This is a great ""fun"" read. I am a huge Chelsea fan. I would highly recommend this book if your in need of a good laugh."
5,Guilty Pleasure,"This is a great guilty pleasure. Of course, this is comedy and not perfectly autobiographical. But there is enough detail here to make it clear that much of this is real! And it's really funny. Chelsea Handler is at her best when the stories share the unnecessary detail that paints the entire picture. She is not only witty and smart as heck, but daring. This reads as not only funny, but so realistic, yet never sad- despite the pathetic nature of some of the situations she finds herself in. For example, a chapter entitled ""skid mark"" - are you kidding me? A classic."
4,Fun From a Distance.,"I purchased this because it was recently on sale and I'd been tempted to purchase other books by the author. For whatever reason, I don't watch Chelsea Lately, but I find her funny. When reading autobiographical stuff, I often ask myself if I'd like to hang out with the author.In this case, no.I would have loved to be friends with her while I was in my twenties though. She's fun to read about from a distance and has a lot of crazy, probably only slightly true, anecdotes and I laughed a fair amount. Enough that I purchased and readLies that Chelsea Handler Told Me (A Chelsea Handler Book/Borderline Amazing Publishing)and I'm listening to the audiobook version ofAre You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea."
5,I never laughed so hard in my life!!,OMG I just finished this book. It made me laugh so hard that I actually cried. My stomach is still sore from laughing. I've always loved Chelsea's stand-up & her TV show ... this book was vintage Chelsea ... brought me back to those free-wheelin' sexually liberated 80's! A quick read - I started it this afternoon and couldn't put it down until I was done. LOVED IT!!
2,lost my interest fast,stories hopped around alot. Found myself skimming through the book and not actually reading it.
1,Who's been giving this five star reviews ?,I've just finished reading this book .I was lured in by all the five star reviews .BIG MISTAKE !This is a tedious account of assorted one night stands its neither funny nor interesting .Don't bother !
2,"Mildly Interesting, Not Terribly Well Written","Carrie Bradshaw (the ""Sex in the City"") Chelsea Handler is not, as been noted in other reviews there is no fashion and no self reflection. To my mind there was little humor either, unless you find the words ""large penis"" funny, apparently a recurring theme for Ms. Handler. Mildly amusing might be a better description for this tome. Unfortunately, it was written at about a fifth grade level. It has been edited well, so far as grammar is concerned; and that is about the best thing I can say about it. Ms. Handler drinks a lot. She has sex a lot. She does not seem to be terribly nice. Her show is often much funnier than this book. If you want to read a funny semi-tell all, read ""Running With Sissors"", and skip this one. I am sorry I bought it."
4,My Horizontal Life,"I am very satisfied with my order. As promised, the book came in pretty good condition. I received the book almost two weeks after ordering it, so it could have been faster. But, for the price, I was extremely satisfied."
5,Hilarious and Liberating!,I had seen Chelsea on the Jay Leno Show and Girls Behaving Badly but this book truly displays her brillance as a comedian and her dedication to the sexual liberation of women. Who else has the guts to admit goggles and odd fetishes are not only for men? I have recommended the book to all my colleagues. My girl friends rolled on the floor with laughter and my male friends read the book like a manual hoping to get a glimpse of how they could get a woman like that in bed! I can't wait to read the next one!
4,A hysterical read,"Okay, so admittedly, this might not be the great American novel or a stellar piece of literature. BUT...if you are just looking for a great laugh, Chelsea is the place to go. And if you've ever had a one-night stand yourself, or even an awkward sexual encounter of any kind...this book will probably make you feel a lot better about yourself and will make you see the humor in your own situation. It's a great summer read, and perfect for girlfriend roadtrip read-alouds!"
3,Funny but short.,"This book was read after ""Are You There Vodka?"" I thought some of the subject matter was a little redundant, although the stories were different. There were some funny parts, but I liked her second book better. It was funnier, written better and longer."
5,Awesome,This book made me laugh out loud a lot. I probably talk about it more than people care to hear but Chelsea Handler is great.
4,Laugh out loud funny,"This book was great. Definitely fulfilled what I was expecting out of it. It kept me busy and laughing out lout on my cardio machines! What I liked the best about the book was her ability to make very uncomfortable situations funny. Also, the events she shared in her book are stories that are never told my women who are embarrassed. It made me feel better about one night stands that I had. I read a review before I read the book about it being demeaning to women. I think it is the opposite. Most women go through it and do not have the guts to talk about it. The turn their head and pretend like it didn't happen. Mind you there were a lot of ""one night stands"" but still worth sharing. Thank you Chelsea!"
2,Beyond Raunchy,"I've read other Chelsea Handler books and thought I knew what to expect, but this book was beyond raunchy. Not an enjoyable read."
5,It's a quickie,It's Chelsea Handler she's always hilarious unless you just don't have a sense of humor! And it's a quick read!
4,My review,This book was good and made me laugh but towards the end it didn't keep up the momentum. Was definitely worth reading though and I enjoyed it.
3,A bit too much,Parts seriously had me hysterical. BUT it was a bit overboard at the same time. I've got a warped sense of humor and am by no means prude but she's just too damn easy.
3,A fun read,"I don't care much for Chelsea Handler's writing style, but a few of the stories made me laugh out loud."
3,Good but not great,"As Chelsea's first book, it was ok, but it was not as good as her latest one, ""Hello Vodka, It's Me Chelsea"". If you are going to read them both, read this one first and then Hello Vodka. If you read it, the other way around, you may be disappointed."
3,Horizontally challenged??,Sadly I liked the book. I feel a little voyeuristic! Not sure if that is spelled correctly. This book reminds me a lot of all the years in my 20's I don't remember very well. :)
1,ugg,"This book was picked for my book club. I could not even get more than a few chapters in. Maybe I'm too much of a prude, but the stories seemed so unreal, over the top, and stereotypical. I like funny stories, but this was just...not..funny. Fortunately I just borrowed the book so I didn't waste any money."
1,my horizontal life,i cannot believe anyone but a retarded pre teen would find this remotely funny. 0 stars from me. give me my money back.
3,dissapointing,I have to agree with the 'dissapointed' crowd on this one. I like Chelsea but found the book not that funny and not very believable. At any rate I did finish it...
4,Great Book to Take on Vacation!,"Fun, easy to read and very entertaining. I laughed out loud many times. Wonderful book to take with your while on a vacation trying to unwind."
4,Hilarious Chelsea,This book is typical Chelsea! She is always cracking me up and loves a good looking stud! Thanks for this great book Chelsea!!!
4,Long Live Handler,"My Horizontal Life was such a good book. I have been a Chelsea Handler fan for years so when I learned she was also and author I was thrilled and went and got my copy. The essay's are so funny that it left me contemplating weather she was telling the truth and making this up. But if I know Chelsea from watching her show, there is no doubt the tales are real. Every chapter in this book is another tale of Chelsea's relationships and one night stands. It was wonderful."
5,So funny I can't put it down!!,I got this book yesterday and haven't put it down since. Chelsea's recap of her hilarious run in's with random guys is great. I've even taken the book to work with me to hide and read it because I couldn't wait till i came home to finish it. Its an easy read and will make you laugh out loud I highly recommend it to any Chelsea Handler fan or even if your a fan of Sex and the City. I can't wait to get her second book!
4,"Brilliant, extremely entertaining...","You don't want to put this book down. You could have the attention span of a flea and still read this book in one sitting. It's that good. Handler is on the cutting edge and will pave the way for many female writers in the future. I also recommend my favorite book about sex and the Kama SutraSex and the Perfect Lover: Tao, Tantra, and the Kama Sutra"
5,Better even than my life!,"I loved this book! I gag and laugh at this book and read stuff out loud to my husband to giggle over as well who sometimes gets the humor and sometimes does not. I think sometimes it simply is a matter of who gets this seriously funny woman. I find her raunchy look at sex simply amazing and funny in a way I love love love! BUY THE BOOK, READ THE BOOK LOVE HER LOVE ME!"
5,Hilarious,One mess up after another in Chelsea's life is our entertainment in this book. These one night standa are hilarious. I highly recommend to any of her fans and new ones!
3,better towards the end,"easy to read as it almost seemed conversational. some parts/language might make you cringe a bit, but she told it as it was... I liked it better towards the end where a bit more depth/true feelings were shown. her ""vodka"" book is much better (feels less empty with more real stories)"
2,Funny... but no work of art,"I brought this for my wife as she thought Ms Handler was funny on TV, It was a okay read, very funny in places but not great, actually in places actually a bit lame."
4,Hilarious,"Great read.You are invited inside the author's psyche and her bedroom. It's a bit voyeuristic, but very funny. Chelsea has a great wit. It was reassuring to see that she seemed to eventually outgrow her promiscuity. In the end, sleep around can be funny, but she admits that it isn't really as fulfilling as an adult, monogamous relationship."
5,laugh out loud funny!!,"I read this in the airport, while getting my nails done and in other various places....and laughed out loud in each place. It is a book too not take to seroiusly, as its chapter after chapter of one night stand experiences. She is funny, honest and always has an opinion....its rare that I laugh at loud while reading....this was tons of fun! Love her other 2 as well. When is the next one coming out???????"
3,"Not bad, but Kindle version has odd characters","I enjoyed the story even though I could not identify with Chelsea. The writing was clever and quite funny.It did annoy me, however, that several times there were odd characters in the Kindle edition (both on the physical Kindle and on Kindle-for-PC):locations 1281-86: case of ? CDlocations 2256-63: suite} Thislocations 2337-42: while you're pregnant ... ?/ you'relocations 2425-31: I spotted my ? versionlocations 2538,46: ""Why not}""Anyone else experience this?"
3,My Horizontal Life,I enjoyed this book alot. Very funny. Though I think it would've been much funnier if it wasn't based on true events. I think alot of it was made up.
5,Chelsea Handler is hysterical,"Laugh out loud funny. Definitely not for teens because it's basically short stories about one-night stands with some graphic content. As an adult, I found her voice laugh out loud funny. Each story was more hysterical than the next. Her brand of humor is definitely on the crude side, so if that's not your bag, then I would skip it. If you find dirty, straight forward humor hilarious, Chelsea Handler's books are a must read!"
3,Not bad,"Good book. Many parts had me laughing, some shocked me too. Funny. Explains a lot as to why Chelsea handler is as funny as she is."
3,She really is a slut,"Chelsea 's sexploitations are as boring as she is. She says she's reformed, but you can't teach an old slut New tricks."
4,None,i loved this book not as smooth as her other bools but great def laughed out loud and will read again
4,LOLing the whole way,This book was so funny. Better than Vodka it's me!! I was reading in Starbucks and was literally laughing out loud.
4,Funny book,"I have never been a fan of Chelsea, but I heard her on The Howard Stern Show and was impressed by how open, honest & funny she was. I decided to give her book a try and it didn't disappoint. It's witty & funny. She is very candid about her experiences & is a great storyteller. I have become a fan & look forward to reading more about Chelsea Handler. Definitely recommend!"
1,MY HORIZONTAL LIFE,NOT FOR KIDSI DID NOT LIKE IT BOO I SHOULD HAVE NOT GOT OR READ IT THIS IS MY OPION
3,Not so Horizontal !,"The humor is marginal and the chronicles of her sexual romps do not exist. There are NO funny ""One Night Stands"" whatsoever, A huge disappointment !The funniest part of the book is the very beginning, when her sister dares her to take a picture of their parents having sex. After that it's pretty much benign tales of her being drunk and that's about it. I returned my copy for a full refund."
2,Funny at times,"This book had it's funny parts. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I laughed aloud a couple times. Easy to read in an afternoon, but not quite as memorable as other memoirists.David Sedaris, who writes memoirs is the master. And If you like knarly memoir humor, Laurie Notaro is excellent."
3,Just ok...not side splitting funny.,"From reading most of the reviews, you would think that this was a drop dead hilarious book but, in my opinion it really isn't that funny. I thought it took awhile to get going and even then it had it's slow parts. But, I must admit the last three chapters do make up for the rest of the book!If you are looking for a book you can spend a day reading curled up on the couch and be somewhat entertained then this is the book for you. Afrer all, it is a very quick read. If you are looking for a book with side splitting laughs, you might want to look somewhere else."
1,Not worth the $,This book was wat too short and dissappointing. It also ended abruptly. Dont waste your $ too.
1,nothing special,"I chose this book to improve on my English, ha-ha... I was sure it will be written in an easy, comprehensible language and I was right. However, the book itself... hmm... if most of us had nothing to do we could write even a better one about our horizontal life ;)Choose this book if you want to read just for readings sake, if you are tired after work and just want to relax..."
5,Soooo funny! I just love this girl!,"After watching a few episodes of Girls Behaving Badly and The Chelsea handler Show....I thought..""I love this girl and the way she expresses herself with no shame."" I rarely ever read but I was so eager to get her book. So I ran to the bookstore to get a copy of her book and I finished the whole thing in a day. It was absolutely hilarious and I'm so happy I bought it. I reccomend this book to anyone who dosen't get offended too eaisly and just wants a good laugh. I love her wit and way of thinking and I'm really hoping she will write another one soon."
5,Hilarious,"It was so funny and dirty all at once- I just loved it. Chelsea is so wrong, it is just right."
2,Reader,This is my first read of Chelsea handler. I honestly thought the book would be longer. It ended rather abruptly. Yet it was entertaining and shocking at times too.
4,Good book,Very good book!!! I enjoyed how the author is very detailed and realistic. Great author and great format in book.
3,Funny,If you like Chelsea lately. This is the book for you. She is very witty and I can almost hear her voice in the story. Her poor parents. It wasn't a constant wet my pants laugh but I did get a good chuckle at times hence the three stars.
2,TMI,"There are some funny bits, but after a while it gets tedious. I kept getting that awkward feeling I get when I'm around an good friend when they are drunk and making an ass of themselves. It's only sort of funny at first and then you just want them to go away."
1,NotMyChoice,"Absolutely an outstanding first chapter, full of humor and laughs. That's where it ends. The rest is all about a drunk slut who had no more sense about what's right and wrong. It wasn't even a good ""X"" rated version. Wouldn't be worth it even if it were free."
2,Handler is one lucky train wreck,"Handler is a train wreck who doesn't know when to stop sharing/lying, although her willingness to take risks and make fun of herself is a key factor in her persona and her success. I'm guessing being the youngest of six kids had a lot to do with it. Like most creative twenty-somethings for whom college and/or traditional employment isn't the obvious choice, it takes her a while to figure out her personal path. I was disappointed by the book, probably because it was so well hyped, and with the exception of a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, I expected it to be funnier than it was. Although I do enjoy Handler as a comedienne, and I would have loved seeing her in the green M&M costume."
4,Screw & Tell,"I'm a big fan of Chelsea Handler's. She's hysterically funny on her E! Show.I must've loved this book because I read it in about 2 days. I laughed out loud several times (her uncontrollable capacity to lie her way into and out of trouble is gleefully fascinating), especially in one chapter where she tries to pass herself off as her ""own twin"" to avoid an embarrassing encounter.One itty bitty constructive comment: She should've avoided the tendency to beat herself up here & there, judging herself, her drinking, her partying, her age/maturity level, as it doesn't exactly ring true (since in the very next chapter she's back to her hard-partying ways again). Next time she should stick to writing only about the fun stuff, or she should save ALL the guilt for the final chapter.A very fun and fast read!"
1,A Waste of Money,"If you enjoy juvenile or even infantile humor, then this is the book for you. But if you're really looking for humor, don't waste your money on this collection of so-called ""one-night stands.""These stories might be funny for stand-up comedy in front of inebriated fans, but in written form are not even close."
1,"A sad ""Groundhog Day"" existence","All of the little vignettes are pretty much the same, girl gets drunk and has cheap sex. Was expecting the female version of ""I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell"" but this falls very short. Save your money."
1,Take your $ and go buy a coffee instead.,"I LOVE Chelsea Handler! I HATED this book.She should have called it ""How to be a Ho."" Her other book ""Are you there, Vodka? It's me, Chelsea."" had a few stories of her sexcapades, but at least it wasn't page, after page, after page, of all of the guys she's slept with. I could barely finish reading it, half way through I just started skimming the chapters and realized that if did take the time to read it cover to cover, I would have wasted a few hours of my life that I was never going to get back."
1,"Not funny, girl","This book is only what it says it is-a collection of the stories of one night stands. It is not wry, sarcastic, insightful, and the most it is not is funny. Not humorous at all. I was expecting so much more, got it to read aloud on a road trip. Ordered it from Amazon, when it came I started and completed reading it at my dining table, it is a fast read and that is all I can say."
2,No Sense of Self,"I like to watch Chelsea's show, and she has a wry sense of humor; however, the way she conducted herself as a young woman is both frightening and sad. The thought of two underage women constantly drunk and inviting Godess knows whom into their beds, including criminals and absolute undesirables, wreaks of low self esteem, lack of self respect and no boundaries. I have to wonder if young women know they are putting themselves in danger when they get drunk and go home with strangers?? Not to mention diseases???? This lifestyle is not healthy. Think before you leap or read! I don't recommend this book to young women, who may be influenced to behave in unhealthy ways."
1,Unbearably Tedious,"Hmmm, she must've slept with all the people who wrote the glowing reviews, too. Maybe that'll be her next terrible book."
1,Horizontal Crap!!!!,I honestly kept reading this book hoping it would get better. It did not. I was waiting for some dirt and nothing happened. It was more of a rambling crap fest. I know people that sleep around and the stories they tell are much better than this. I really didn`t care about the part where the doctor was gay. It didn`t shock me at all. I`ve heard worse. Some people just want to write books because they are famous....
1,This Book on CD arrived at my house and wouldn't work.,"I ordered this Book on CD. But after trying 4 different CD players, it would never work. I have no idea how to rate this CD because the product won't play! I just mailed it back to the sender hoping that they will either give me my money back or send a new one."
4,This book made me laugh,I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. My life is and has always been boring and when I read I live my life through theirs and I have to tell you this was fun. This book isn't for everyone and I certainly don't agree with how she lived her life but you have to enjoy her humor. She says what everyone else thinks and I see nothing wrong with that.
5,Pleased =),"Very pleased with my order. Book came in perfect condition, much better than expected. Always love those kind of surprises. Great read, very funny. Recommended."
4,Review,A delightful read was pleasantly surprised by the laugh out loud read. Would purchase another of Chelsea's books in a heart beat.
4,"If your 20s were boring, live vicariously through this book","I'm partial to Chelsea Handler anyway just because I love her personality, attitude, and her humor. While this wasn't my favorite book of hers I loved it from cover to cover. It was funny and the adventures she landed herself into explains why her comedy is so funny. I'll admit, she's not for everyone. Her humor might be too raunchy and crass for someone that is not ok with booze, drugs, and promiscuity."
4,Humorous like her Tv show,I like Chelsea and this book is in keeping with her humor. I see now why her Tv show is so popular.
2,"Love Chelsea! The Book, Not So Much",I am a big fan of Chelsea`s and i heard lots of great things about this book. So i had to read it. I was a little disappointed. Nothing spectacular and some funny moments.
4,I love reading auto-biographies that are interesting and fun.,"What I Loved: Chelsea is so very Chelsea in this book. She gets herself into the most unique situations and always seems to keep a sense of humor about herself. She manages to make even the most uncomfortable situation funny.What I Liked: She never names people--she gives them cute little nicknames. I also like the chronological order of things, her situations change as she gets older and she doesn't try to make herself look like a saint.What was So-So: Not a darn thing! I listened to this on audio book and found myself laughing out loud often.Why I gave it a 4: I love reading auto-biographies that are interesting and fun. Chelsea managed to keep a sense of humor about her life and relay that to the reader/listener.Book Received From: Purchased on Audible[...]"
4,Hilarious!,"I don't think I have laughed so much or so hard while reading a book. The stories that Chelsea recounts are very well told and are so humorous. Some of the things that happen to her are so happenstance that I can't help but question if they are embellished. I love that she is a compulsive liar when she drinks; the made-up stories she tells the men she meets are beyond hilarious. And the encounter with the midget is priceless. I absolutely love/hate her dad too. He is so quirky and beyond offensive!If you are looking for a light, quick, funny read, this is it! I thoroughly enjoyed all of her stories and her brilliant one-liners."
4,Chelsea is funny!,I gotta say this book is pretty funny. Love Chelsea's writing and thought process. She's just outrageous and hilarious! But I have to wonder how much of it is exaggerated to make it funny because I can't imagine any person being involved in so many crazy predicaments. Very entertaining though.
5,AMAZING!,"""My Horizontal Life"" was a great read. It was very entertaining, and very descriptive. I shared excerpts of it with several friends and after I finished it many people wanted to borrow it. It's a book that will make you laugh over and over."
1,Beneath the Losers She Ridicules (Not Literally),"To paraphrase James Joyce, this is a strange title for a book that has neither a one night stand nor a horizontal author."
5,I pi$$ed my pants laughing,"I am, by my own account, Chelsea's equal...when it comes to attitude, sense of humor, and agility in bed(s). I laughed SO hard through this book my husband thought I was crying in bed. At one point (ok, so more like 4), I pissed myself from laughing so hard....Definately a good read. And I like how each chapter can be read individually, like when you're on the crapper...though I read mine in bed last night and had to change the sheets this morning.....If you're rude, crude, and not embarrassed to be peeled off the floor at a party...READ IT..."
1,What a waste,"What a waste this purchase was, what a waste this addict's life is. This trashy collection of sexual experiences reveals a few genuinely humorous spots, but to me screams out that this gal has addictions to booze, drugs and, oh, yeah...sex. What she didn't get from her lax, anti-moralistic parents has her jobless, running from man to man, drinking and drugging (and DRIVING while in this condition), and seemingly confused and without goals. Harsh in her judgement of others, she has no room to criticize, when her sexual conquests far outnumber her overall IQ. She often tries too hard to be funny, and winds up just sounding extremely pathetic."
4,It seems they are all the same no matter the generation,"Very very funny! I could relate to some of the episode's, too big, too small, black, married, dumber than a door nail. These were back in the day, my day, I`m 10 years older than Chelsea, and some were just embarrassing, like the one I called the Screamer! Wonderful, intellectual, good looking, athletic, owned his own company, this is SILICON VALLEY in its heyday, 1978 - 1985, great sex from a great Italian from New York. But, and this is a big but, when he climaxed he screamed bloody murder at the top of his lungs. I swear that I hurt him Of course I went back to see what this was all about and he did it again! Oh well he was such a great guy, this went on for a few years, so what's a few quirks between friends?"
4,Funniest Book ever,I had to knock one star off because the book was way smaller than I thought it would be. I read it in entirety in about 3 hours. Kind of selfish but her writing leaves you wanting more. But that being said it's a very quick read sure to make you laugh out loud. There were many times I had to stop and reread what I just read to my boyfriend so he could laugh as well. I love her books they are hilarious.
5,FUNNY!,"I have read a lot of ""funny"" books, but this is the funniest thing I have ever read. It's frank, slightly vulgar, and HILARIOUS!"
2,"very ""so-so""","I was told that ""Are You There, Vodka..."" was hilarious, so I bought both books. I haven't as yet read that one, but after reading ""Horizontal"", I'm not making this book a priority. Disappointing. Also, unsettling to read about someone quite gifted living such a pathetic and skanky life."
1,I want my time and money back!,"Five stars?! WTF people? I can't even tell you how dull and offensive this book is. I don't mind edgy literature, but this is just one boring pile of garbage. There is nothing smart or creative in this book. It's filled with generic story lines and terrible writing. I did not relate to the character in this book nor did I like her. She comes across with no awareness of self. All I can say is dumbdumb!"
4,Funny,"Funny and irreverent, Chelsea delivers short stories of her life. Not for the conservative, but a good read for the not-so-faint-of-heart and a light, breezy, funny read."
4,Easy Reading,This book was not as good as her other book but still was entertaining and worth purchasing. It is an easy read.
2,Just a Quickie,If you're looking for something to read on an hour flight or just for a quick one nighter this book would be a fair performer.
1,decieved by 5 star ratings...this book is horrible,"i was interested in a light comical read and what i got was this poorly written collection of nasty conquests. she argues the importance of sex when getting to know someone, then takes a dump on her point by describing all her messy drunken sexual feats with nameless trashy men. what important things did she larn about these men other than to give them idiotic nicknames and barely remember half of the sex she supposedly had? none of the sex is even recounted in all its filthy glory."
1,Sad....,"I bought this book to read over my spring break (I""m a teacher). I thought a good, light, funny - slightly on the naughty side book would be a good distraction. This book made me sad. If these stories are really true - poor Chelsea. If they are lies - poor Chelsea. To write a book about someone who spends so much of their time drinking, doing drugs and having sex with any man she finds hot - sorry - not my cup of tea. I am very accepting of alternative lifestyles and people doing what they need to do to be happy. I just found this book to be a story about a very sad, angry individual who engages in some pretty high risk behaviors. I'm surprised she has survived these experiences without getting raped, seriously hurt or diseased. High risk behavior is not something to promote - nor make fun of."
4,Good read,Very entertaining book. I enjoyed reading and I will definitely look for the rest of the books that Chelsea has written
5,Guaranteed to keep you laughing if you have that kind of humor,"Chelsea Handler books aren't for everyone but luckily I share a similar humor with her. I think a lot of her stories are written slightly tongue-in-cheek. As cruel as she appears to be to her conquests, she knows how to make fun of herself, and that's the kind of comedian I appreciate. I don't read her books for thought-provoking allegories, I read them because I want to be entertained and I want to laugh so hard that I too, pee my pants a little. This hasn't happened yet, but it's probably because my kegal muscles are a lot stronger than hers. I definitely recommend this book if you share a similar sense of humor with her and want to start saying words like ""coslopus"", ""chunk"", and ""nugget"".A definite plus to reading her books is that sometimes I'll be somewhere and suddenly think of a line/story she wrote and start laughing out loud for no reason."
2,the worst Chelsea book,"the worst of the Chelsea books. She sure is rich, famous, funny, cute, clever, smart, ballsy, odorific and a good tv show host."
3,Interesting,Interesting read. No surprises. Wanted to read more about how she ended up with her own show. I was surprised that the title was literal.
3,My Horizontal Life,"I liked it for the most part. Think, no matter how crass any of us women can be, sharing the skid mark story could have been left out."
2,Not as good as her 1st,It was a quick easy read but not as funny as her 1st book. Kind of pointless - no plot.
1,Disappointment,"I found her other book, ""Are You There Vodka, It's Me, Chelsea"" very amusing. I didn't laugh hardly at all reading this one. I almost didn't even finish it. The only positive is that it made me glad that I'm no longer single or on the bar scene. I'm just glad I read it for free on my Kindle through my Amazon Prime membership."
3,Not as much fun this time around,"This was a fun read, but I didn't think it was as funny as Are You There Vodka. She's always entertaining, and doesn't disappoint, but I guess I was hoping for even more over the top stories."
3,Very Interesting book,"Chelsea Handler is a crazy lady!! This book starts out with her taking a picture of her parents having sex and ends up with her taking a break from men. In between is a rash of one night stands and partying and tons and tons of drinking. I can't say that I am a Chelsea Handler fan, I may have watched a total of 5 mins of her show on E!, but reading this book makes me want to check it out. If you want to read about an alcoholic sex fiend this is a good read for you. It made me laugh, I could relate to some parts of it as well."
4,Raunchy & sarcastic in a good way.,A comedic look at a life of sexual escapades which many of us that came of age in the 70's & 80's can relate to. :)
1,"boring, was practically forcing myself to read",i wouldn't waste your time and money if i were you I learnt a lesson if a book is a bestseller it could still be totally lame
2,Borrrrring.,"Okay, Chelsea, so you've done all these wild things. So what? You've made it BORING to read about. All these little stories just get boringer and duller. I am so disappointed. This book is not even funny. It's not worth the time. And I am going to stop wasting my time by writing a review for this book, which can be summed up with one word: Unoriginal."
4,Fast read,This book was entertaining. It was hard to put down because her stories are interesting.It was the first time in a long time that I have finished a whole book without getting bored.
4,Fun-ny,I love Chelsea & her humor. Definitely laugh out loud throughout the book. If you like Chelsea this is a must read book.
1,Wasted Money,"Let this review be a review for both Chelsea Handler books I bought. Crapola!Terrific comedienne, she should do what she does best and writing books aint it!"
4,Love,"So much love for this book. It's hilarious and so awesome, I couldn't put it down! Absolutely fabulous writing! Way to go Chelsea!"
4,Think like a man,An interesting read that will crack you up! I like that it's well written account of being a single woman who is not afraid to approach sex and relationships like a man. And most of us girls have at some time done the same. It's nice to know their are others lol
3,Funny and Sad,This was a fun book to read but I found myself becoming sad for this woman and a little tired of her endless pursuit of meaningless sex and mindless drinking. (Of course - the title does give it away!) There are moments that are laugh out loud hilarious and clever - and those make the book worth it. A great read for the beach - and one to give away to a friend after reading. Not one to save and treasure for rereading.
1,Not enjoyable,"I read this book only because it was like passing by a horrific traffic accident and having to see the carnage. I thought it was going to be something mildly enjoyable for a vacation read, but it wasn't even that. Not well written at all, just thrown together in a very haphazard way."
1,horrible horrible book !!,"Before this book, i was reading some heavy stuff and i wanted to read something light,funny, a no brainer.I like Chelsea ,but this book sucks big time , it's boring, not funny at all and she seems to be a very shallow person with no respect for people's feelings ,let alone for herself. Although she is funny on her show and stand up gigs, this book reeks alcohol and Chlamydia from cover to cover. I wonder if she ever has caught any STD?? ,because one can not party that hard without any consequences."
2,Just OK,"This was the second book of Chelsea Handler's that I read and it is probably a good thing I read it second. While I found this memoir to be witty and entertaining, I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea. I expected more hilarity from a book based on Handler's lifetime experience with one-night stands. I also expected more pizazz, which I didn't get.Again, it was witty and entertaining. If you are a die-hard fan, definitely read it. If you are looking for a great memoir to read, I would probably skip this one."
4,Very entertaining!,"I found the book to be very entertaining. I kind of, couldn't put it down. It was definitely typical Chelsea."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Heard the book was equally scandalous and humorous.What impressed me: Handler lays it all out there, without shame. There is no notes of apology in her tone, which pleased me to no end.What disappointed me: For a comedian, Chelsea Handler just isn't very funny. I applaud anyone who is open about their sexuality, especially when they don't conform to today's moral standards, but Handler comes off as trying to hard to be outrageous as opposed to just being secure in herself.Recommended: Maybe. I'm going to try another one of Handler's memoirs, but I fear she may continue to come off undeservedly self-important a la Augusten Burroughs."
3,disappointed,"was expecting more. it was a collection of ""almost"" one night stands. kept waiting for it to get good. the stories felt like a collection of not funny enough cast off's in her comedy routine."
4,Pretty good,"I like this book 'cause it was funny. That's pretty much what kept me going to finish it. And I gave it a good rating because of that since not many authors can be so open about their sexuality and funny at the same time, especially realizing their mistakes.The reason I didn't give it a 5th star -- the lying. I mean it's all fun and games 'til you realize lying is not gonna work -- then you *should* cut back a little. Sure the lying had a lot to do with the hilarity factor, but in the end, it didn't help with the desired effect.I loved the midget story."
5,So Funny!,I loved this book. It is laugh-out-loud hilarious! The dumb-dumb chapter about her roommate is the best
3,"Funny girl, not so great writer","I've been obsessed off and on with Chelsea's show, Chelsea Lately, so I was excited to see what she had to offer in the memoir department. Content-wise, it was exactly what I was expecting: blunt, provacative, shocking, and ultimately hilarious. Unfortunately she makes a much better host/comedian than she does a writer. Her prose is juvenile at best. Not that I should be looking for some amazing work of literature from Chelsea (which is why I still rated it a three), I was just put off by how bad the writing was; Creative Writing 101 stuff. For a quick, funny read, it's great. It's candidness is quite admirable."
5,Like listening to your outrageous friend!,"I loved this book, it was hard to put down, so I read it all in one night. I purchased the paperback from Borders (I had a coupon) and I was not dissappointed with my purchase. The book has a total of 213 pages and it just reminded me of my very outrageous friends. They just know how to tell you a story that will just crack you up! I will definitely recommend it to my friends."
3,Chelsea is great,I love Chelsea Handler. She's funny and easy to read. Be prepared to read this in an hour or two.
1,gross,"how has this awful , meritless, currently fat, and generally snarky unpleasant THING entered our world? please make it stop. go buy a Grace Kelly book and wonder? okay? Disgusting"
2,Patricia,"This book was not well written at all! Occasionally, there was a clever sentence or paragraph but those were few and far between."
2,Disappointed,"I love Chelsea Handler's show. She's funny, and there are usually equally funny comedians guest-starring.Her sense of humor didn't translate into the book. I can't remember laughing once, or even smiling. As for the book being about one-night stands, she seemed fairly conservative about what she included - which is at odds with her typical style - and while the title suggests a lot of sleeping around, most of the sexual encounters she detailed didn't end with intercourse. I'm not saying I expected a play-by-play or anything, but her life has hardly been horizontal.I guess what I'm trying to say is, the book makes for a semi-interesting memoir, but it isn't about a series of one-night stands. And in my opinion, it isn't funny."
3,Not what I expected,"I did enjoy the book, and thought it was funny. I expected this book by Chelsea to be more like her stand up routines or her bits on the her TV show. It was more like random stories about hook-ups without the same charm as listening to her on TV."
4,Easy Read & Entertaining,"I enjoyed reading this book. I read it over a long weekend, and the chapters just flew by. It was easy to read through. Chelsea Handler wrote the book from her own personal experiences. Each chapter is a new experience from her life. The stories were real and a bit humorous. It wasn't extremely funny, but kept me entertained and interested in reading til the end of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a light-hearted, quick read."
5,LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY!,"okay, I used to never understand people saying they laughed out loud while reading a book. Well, I know now after reading Chelsea's book, I couldn't help myself. I'm talking tears so bad from laughing that I had to keep wiping my eyes. She is hilarious! If you have any hangups about sex, or drinking etc., pass this book up. Otherwise, sit back and ENJOY!"
1,puerile tripe,"promiscuity used as a blunt instrument and demonstrating that bad taste is not necessarily humor. mp2, jupiter, fl"
2,Maybe I'm not the target audience?,"This book must have been written for women who have lived a very demure life. Maybe they, having enjoyed living vicariously through the author, have the book all the five star reviews that boosted its score.I for one have found Chelsea's adventures neither funny nor titillating, and , since there is no dept whatsoever to this collection of vignettes , I consider the book to have no redeeming value .She gets 2 stars based on looks alone. Yes , after reading her sophomoric stammering sexual stories , I feel I am entitled to make a sexist statement myself."
2,Boring memoir with faint touches of humor,"On TV, Chelsea Handler can be funny, but it doesn't carry over into this book. Mostly about one-night stands that feel highly embellished to appear humorous except they really aren't. Comedy based on self-centeredness, fuelled by alcohol, doesn't appeal to me."
2,Not my idea of a good time...,"I have a pretty racy sense of humor but I found this book to be, well....really sad. Its just a bunch of stories about a drunk girl having sex with random guys."
1,Don't bother,"I can't believe that so many people actually enjoyed reading this book! The only thing positive that I can say is that she is very smart to use this title. It was very misleading and I am sure a lot of people picked up the book expecting something racier.The book is more about mocking men's physical traits than it is about one night stands. If you really insist on buying your own copy, I'm putting mine up for sale. Maybe I can make my money back."
1,"What A Racist, Self Absorbed, Small Woman - Get Over Yourself","Wow - I was so excited to start reading this book - thinking it would be funny, light and a good read - Was I WRONG. Not only is she racist and way over the top, she is very full of herself - This book reads like a fly on the wall commenting on her slutty and boring life which lacks anything with substance, actually quite sad. I would rather watch the fly on the wall."
4,Chealsea Handler,Good book. I love her. She is so funny and a good writer. Can't wait to get her next book.
4,Really enjoyed it!!!,"I am a huge Chelsea Handler fan. In many aspects her and I have a similar personallity. I found this book to be very entertaining. It's hard to believe all the stories but she is either very creative or a little insane either way it was worth my time. If you like Chelsea, its wrth a read."
4,You Can't Help But Laugh,"Are you tired of winter? Are you sick of politics? Do you need something mindless to read? Are in you in the mood to laugh? If you answered Yes to any of these questions, then My Horizontal Life is your type of book. I'm a happily married middle aged man and I found myself laughing at some of the craziness that Chelsea has gotten herself into. I loved the characters in the book. The book is very easy to read and at times, a real page turner because you knew a twist was coming. During these tough economic times -- we need to laugh and Chelsea Handler provides perfect relief."
1,Boring Book,Not a good read. Not enough substance to any one story. I didn't even finish reading it because I was so bored.
1,Not too good,"If you into description of drinking, sex, and drugs, it would be fine. I did not care much for it. And I'm not a prude either."
4,Light read for a good laugh,"For the most part I really enjoyed this book but I thought the way the book ended was more of a cutoff and didn't leave me completely satisfied. I also have to wonder if 100% of it was factual because it does say Memoir/Humor..? Overall a good beach read, light and easy."
3,Entertaining!,"Good read for anyone who experienced their twenties wild at heart & now lives a life of scheduled play-dates, domestic monotony, and occasional early am nookie. It's fun to reminisce about those days of why not...."
4,Good book on a sad sad life!,"Chelsea is funny and poignant, she doesn't leave much to the imagination. The only problem was that the ending didn't lead anywhere. At first it was super funny but by the end it was sad. It just ends with a sad mess of a life."
5,laugh out loud,I am not much for comedy but this left me laughing literally out loud on more then one occasion! My husband looked at me often as if I had three heads due to the laughing!
3,Entertaining,"I liked this book but didnt love it. There were times it was laugh out loud funny and other times I just kind of thought ""Really??!"". I thought the way it ended was a little odd. I wondered if the stories were all true or some of them were made up? It is small, easy and quick to read and will make you laugh out loud in parts."
3,Eh...,"I got this book because it was a recommendation in lieu of some of the other 'off-color' reading that I order from Amazon, so I figured why not? I ordered it and took some time and finally sat down to read it! It was GREAT....until the end..."
5,Great Book,"This book was really funny and the stories are absolutely ridiculous! I definitely recommend this book, Chelsea Handler is a great author and she really knows how to make you laugh!"
5,What a funny book!!,"This is a hilarious book!! I love every short story she told. Chelsea is really honest about herself in this book. She puts all her craziness out there for people to enjoy it. It is and easy read. Too bad I haven't heard great things about the book that follows this one. However, this book displays well her comedy skills."
3,Good Read,"If you have a lazy Sunday when its raining and you want a bit of a chuckle, grab this book, no wherenear as naughty as it suggests"
2,Boring!,Didn't like it all. Boring and kind of disgusting. What did I expect right.....I couldn't ready much of it.... Basically a throw away.
3,"Not really one-night stands, as far as I remember","I DO remember she trashes New Jersey, but that's as old as can be.I'm trying to remember what I got out of the rapid-fire hail of bullets that is Handler's voice.She talks about a series of short relationships she has, and some of it's funny, but sometimes it's just sad. Sometimes I felt sad for the guys.There are some funny stories, like when she asked an extremely spoiled guy to be her ""date"" at her sister's wedding, and when she went on a cruise with her friend ""DumDum,"" but I expected more.And if she drinks half as much as she says she does, I think she should worry a bit. Alcohol is not kind to middle-aged women."
3,Not as funny as thought it was going to be.,I have always enjoyed watching Chelsea Lately and thought that Chelsea Handler was so funny but I didn't laugh once when reading this book. It's a good book but if your buying it for a good laugh then I would not suggest buying it.
4,Chelsea Just Wants to Have Fun,"Warning: Chelsea Handler is not for everyone. She can be insensitive, profane and politically incorrect but she is also likeable and best of all funny, funny, funny. She's a girl who just wants to have fun, so what if her idea of fun is vodka and a man??These essays are humorous and there are a few that everyone can relate to. Some are over the top but all of them are funny, even the ones that make you cringe a little. It is a book that makes you laugh, or roll your eyes and wonder: What was she thinking? It's also a book that you can share with your friends, because everybody knows somebody like the people in this book.If you like your humor a little twisted and enjoy Chelsea, who is clearly a hot mess, then read this book."
4,My Horizontal Life,"Damn funny! Chelsea is a crack up and this book is a very quick, easy read. This was a book that allowed me to leave my stresses of the day at the door and just laugh. I couldn't put it down and finished it in one reading session. If you are a bit straight laced - this isn't for you! An open minded approach to ones sex life is required. :)"
3,Reads like popcorn,"The book chronicles the author's sexcapades and dating adventures from her teens to her late twenties. I read it in just two sittings. It's a light, fun, breezy book that reads like popcorn -- it's enjoyable and yummy but maybe not the most sustaining. There's not much in terms of character development or deep revelations here. Still, parts are laugh out loud funny, and it's fun and easy entertainment."
4,Exactly what you'd expect... for adults and FUNNY.,"If you've ever watched Chelsey Lately on television then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect with this book. It is a bit racy, but funny as hell. I can't imagine her family being very pleased as they read it... but who cares! It's honest and some parts will make you laugh out loud."
2,My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One-Night Stands,"I read her previous book and laughed till I couldn't laugh anymore, This book,however, was so not funny ..... I ordered her next bood and only hope it is as funny as the first. I would not recommend this book to anyone,"
2,Rich Jewish Girl,"Ms. Handler is basically a little blonde tramp from a wealthy family. No idea were the money comes from but they have a house on Martha's Vineyard and Chelsea always seems to have a car and plenty of money to enjoy lots of sex without actually doing anything. It must be nice going through life knowing your parents will always pay the bills. Stories and she get boring around page 130. She also is very proud of how much she drinks and all the naughty drugs she takes. It all goes to show that if you are pretty and have money people will think you have talent and give you even more money. She will turn out to be an burned out blonde nobody remembers, Very sad, not funny at all."
2,not the best tell all,"was at a car shop and read the book in one sitting. She is not as wild as I thought she would be. The book is kinda boring, I had much higher expectations of drama and excitement,"
5,Loved it!!!,"I, like many people, live a very busy life with work and home and find it hard to find time to fit reading a whole book into it. However I could not put this book down and finished it in 3 days!! By far the best book I have read in the last ten years at least!! I love Chelsea and her awesome sense of humor. This book is a must read for anyone wanting a good laugh from the words of a quick witted, intelligent, and funny woman!"
4,It's a funny book!,"I read this book immediately after reading 'I hope they serve beer in hell' by M Tucker, and I did not like it at the beginning - it seemed like forced humor. But it gets a lot better as you read it. I definitly recommend it."
5,FUNNY,"I got this book as one of my Amazon Prime Monthly books. I had read her ""Are you there Vodka? It's me Chelsea"". Laughed through that whole book so figured why not try another one. This book is just as funny. She has defiantly done some crazy things in her life and is not ashame of any of them. Be prepared for a great laugh and severl ""are you kidding me"" moments!"
3,This book was good....,"not great... I actually liked her newer book better (are you there vodka.. its me Chelsea).. After reading that book first, I was thinking this one had to be even more raunchy... but it wasn't what I expected. It wasn't bad... I enjoy the way she writes. I just was let down after reading the other book first."
5,Hilarious,"I read ""Are you there Vodka, It's Me Chelsea?"" and loved it so much that I immediately ordered ""My Horizontal Life"". Chelsea has a brilliant way of telling stories that makes you fell like you are out having a drink with a close friend. Not one to pass on to my grandma but definitely all of my girlfriends!"
3,Read it for my book club....,The book was an easy read...Finished it in a couple of hours... It was funny. Was I ROTF LMAO?... eh..Not realy..But ...it was pleasant and produced some giggles..
5,LOL,This is one of the funniest if not THE funniest book I have ever read. I picked it up to read on a 13 hour flight from Japan to the states and I could not put it down. I was seriously LAUGHING OUT LOUD and I'm sure everyone around me thought I was crazy. I highly recommend this book! Chelsea is hilarious!!!
4,Good read,"Hysterical! The title says it all! This book kept me laughing from start to finish! I dont know if her stories are all true or if they are embellished some, but either way it makes for a fun fast read! Her humor cracks me up. Cant wait to see her next book that comes out in 2010."
5,This is a must-read!,"Chelsea Handler is absolutely hysterical! I laughed out loud throughout the whole book! Brilliant, extremely entertaining... you don't want to put this book down. You could have the attention span of a flea and still read this book in one sitting. It's that good. Handler is on the cutting edge and will pave the way for many female writers in the future."
1,Waste of Time,There is nothing below a single star to give otherwise I would have given it. Since I borrowed the book I can't say I wasted any money but I think the time I spent reading it was a wate.
2,Misadventures of a Self-deprecating Minx,"What one person may find hilarious, another views as ho-hum. From reading some of the other reviews, I apparently am in the yawn minority. I don't know, maybe it's because I'm a middle-aged guy. A half dozen, forced smiles was all Ms. Handler's book elicited from me. Also, the veracity of her adventures comes into question due to the fact the Ms. Handler portrays herself as almost one step short of being a pathological liar. If you are someone that is looking for a light, summer read and doesn't want to worry about having to use a dictionary, you'll probably enjoy this book. It wasn't my cup of tea."
5,HILARIOUS!,"IF YOU ARE EVER IN A BAD MOOD, NEED A LIFT, CAN'T SLEEP OR JUST WANT TO LAUGH, LAUGH, AND REALLY LAUGH, YOU MUST READ CHELSEA'S BOOK! IT IS SO FUNNY, THAT WHILE I WAS READING IT I HAD TO LOOK AROUND TO SEE IF ANYONE HEARD ME LAUGHING SO HARD! I REALLY HAVE TO THINK A BOOK IS FUNNY TO LAUGH OUT LOUD--MOST ARE MILDLY FUNNY, BUT THIS BOOK WAS A JOY TO READ. SHE GIVES US HER HEART AND SOUL AND HUMOR! i LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT AND CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SHE WRITES A NEW BOOK! I WILL BE FIRST IN LINE TO BUY IT!"
5,Hysterically Ribald Read,"The stories in My Horizontal Life are orignal, honest, compelling, and laugh-out loud surprising. Handler puts the target on her own back by shining a bright light on her behavior in dark rooms. Refreshingly unapologetic, the author offers the reader her post-coital confessions - the kind reserved for best friends. I read this book in one sitting. Handler pulls no punches and has a one-in-a-million comic point of view."
1,Not a very good book.,"I love Chelsea Handler as a comedian and as a writer, but this particular book did not catch my attention at all. This is a pass."
2,Interesting Life Chelsea.,"Ok, but how do you remember all those encounters? I guess they were worth remembering. I wonder if you would change anything?"
5,Hilarious!!!,I love Chelsea Handler!!! Laugh out loud funny as usual. If you're having a bad day or just need a pick me up you can't go wrong with this one. Her delightfully raunchy humor will have you laughing the whole way through.
4,The Third Book Improves The Series,"Well, the author sure has a knack for ending books on cliffhangers! The mystery and intrigue is certainly deepening as this saga progresses. The plots have twists and turns and the characters are strong. As each one progresses, I am more and more interested in this unique story."
5,Book three just doesnt quit...,"The third installment of this exceptional series continues the thrills and lays on the intrigue as we deal more thoroughly with the royal family of Amber...they make my family look like the Bradys...and Corwin continues to kick a$$ and take names. Arguably the most intelligent, well-written, and exciting fantasy series ever written."
4,The real deal,"5 stars for the seller, there was a minor problem & they were very helpful!As for the product itself, it's the real thing - it smells the way it's supposed to. My mom loved it!"
4,"Mellow, but wonderful!","Marc Antoine is one of my favorite artists, and Hi-Lo Split follows suit as far as nice, mellow ""driving"" music. I often listen to him in the wintertime, because his music makes me think of the warmth of the tropics! I usually don't care for ""covers"", but he does a nice job with ""Spooky"" (originally done by the Classics 4). There are also a couple of tunes that will have you tapping your toes. If you like relaxing music, buy this CD - you won't be sorry!"
1,Horror?,"Whoever wrote the first sentence of the Product Features is obviously not a parent, describing diaper changing of a baby boy's diaper ""as an even bigger horror story"" just goes to show phobic our society has become!!! Now that's a HORROR Story!Product Features* Changing a baby girl is not all glitz and glory. Changing a baby boy is an even bigger horror story until now!"
1,Do not buy these!! Keep your money!,"I thought these would be great, NOT!! Total waste of money. They are so lightweight and small they simply don't ""stay"" where they need to. It's like trying to get a cotton ball to stay on baby. Just use a baby washcloth to cover baby while you change his diaper to prevent ""sprays""."
5,great idea and love it,"What else to say but they are fantastic. So much easier to clean verses the changing table cover, your clothes, babies clothes, a towel, socks, and whatever else was nearby.The only down fall for us was that at 6mths our son realized he had something down there and started pulling them off and trying to eat them. We have since had to take our chances at diaper change time since we can no longer use these fantastic teepees."
1,"Cute, but dumb","Cute little shower gift as a joke, but less than useless in actual practice. Unless you have a third hand to hold it down while you're changing your baby... they don't stay on by themselves, and even more so if he actually pees!!"
1,Not on a squirming baby,"These are a great idea, however, they are too small and are impossible to keep in place on a squirming baby. If your child is still while you are changing him, these may be a great option for you.Don't waste the money - throw a diaper over them."
2,not the best for your money...,"These are a great idea but in reality dont work too well. They are too small and once my little boy starts peeing they fly off, babies-r-us has a larger version that covers the entire area (like a sports cup) rather than just the tip top that I prefer."
3,cute but...,"You know, this a cute little idea. I purchased them after my husband & I were both...christened...I thought it would be perfect. They simply don't help for us...he wriggles and their gone. Seriously, buy a pack of inexpensive washclothes."
2,"Great concept, but not as useful as I hoped.","I think the concept of the peepee teepee is a good one. However, in practice, they don't really stay on very well, and at best, simply divert the ""flow"". If all you can really do is redirect your baby's pee, than an extra diaper, wash cloth or even a wipe will do the job. As cute as they are, we're just not using the ones we bought. I do think I'll stick them in my diaper bag, though... just in case I'm running short on wipes."
4,These Teepee's came in handy!,"My husband was disgusted when he found out I spent money on this product. ""What a waste"" he said. Well, the same night I received these teepee's our son had a very bad diaper rash. I put the teepee on and used a bandaid to secure it. He was able to sleep diaper-free all night long without making a big mess. His diaper rash was gone the next morning! My husband was impressed. The only improvement I'd wish for is for the teepee to be more absorbent. Maybe make some out of the same material in diapers?!"
3,cute,"I bought these because they are cute and all the celebrities were buying them as well. It was good, because during a diaper change, he peed and it soaked up so much of the pee! I was surprised because its so small. It was good because I didn't have to change his clothes again, the bed sheet under him, etc. I hardly use it now, because its too hard to keep it in place."
2,silly,"I read this book and felt sad I wasted money on it. This book is weird and I don't think in this world there are as strange of characters as in this book. Women with a"" breast power physic night"", come on! Unless you are totally out there who would be part of something like that? How many of us get together with other women and look at each other's breast to help us cope? How did this book get such great reviews? Who is reading this? Save your money."
1,I actually complained to the publisher!,"I don't know why this book was written or why anyone published it! I even wrote a letter to the publisher to complain about the grammatical errors, misspelled words, etc. There were so many mistakes that I was distracted from the story, itself. The beginning of the book was promising, which is why I downloaded the whole book after reading the sample, but it never really went anywhere. And if you're going to have a character learn how to use a gun to protect herself and other characters repeatedly tell her to ""Shoot to kill!"" someone ought to use a gun at some point!P.S. The publisher never responded to my letter."
2,Boring,"Another one of those books that seemed promising, but just went nowhere. The characters were fairly interesting, but the plot just didn't hold my interest. Would not recommend."
4,Sweet Victory,"A bit vulgar in places for me, but nonetheless an interesting book. I laughed out loud in places, cringed in others. The author described terrible abuse of many different kinds that had been inflicted on most of the main characters. Although those sections were so difficult to read, the characters' personal triumphs were uplifting."
3,very good reading but rather predictable,"I love Cathy Lamb's work and find her very safe and fulfilling. This book was no exception. She writes good stories that fill you up but are just so NOT REAL. It's a feel good read and you will enjoy it but it's not real life and things just don't all fall into place as this book suggests. I loved reading it, I couldn't put it down even though in my heart I always knew where it was going so it won't disappoint but beware that you aren't going to have a surprise ending to this book.I recommend that if you're looking for a good beach read, this is your book. If you're looking for a book that's hardy and deep, then look for something else."
1,Not worth buying.,"Did not even finish this book. I usually keep at it hoping it will get better, but gave up halfway through this one. Would not recommend it."
4,julia's chocolates,"Entertaining. Starts a little slow but picks up pretty quickly. A good read; however, the ending is too fairy tale-ish."
2,Couldn't finish,We chose this for a book club. I had trouble with it. It didn't grab me. My book club friends liked it and found it amusing. I really just couldn't get passed the first couple of chapters. I found it typical and kind of stupid. Nothing extraordinary.
4,Recommendable read,"Someone recommended this book to me, and I in turn recommended it to someone else. I found this book, while sometimes outrageous, a completely enjoyable reading experience. I think that is why I did like it...the outrageous characters made me laugh out loud, and I couldn't wait to turn the page to find out what else was going to happen. The right amount of joy and sorrow are thrown into this book....what more could you ask for?"
1,Couldn't finish it. Wouldn't want to.,"After a riveting opening sentence that promises great things to come -- ""I left my wedding dress hanging on a tree somewhere in North Dakota."" -- it's downhill fast and hard. The female characters' disparaging attitudes toward men are tired, dated and just plain sad. Then there's the bizarre, new age-y ""wisdom"" on display in the ""let your breasts speak to you"" scene. Oh puh-leez. That's where I bagged it (very early on in the novel). My recommendation: Don't waste your money, time or mind on this tripe."
2,What am I missing?,"When a book is so highly rated, it puzzles me as to why I don't feel the same way. This was a ""canned"" romance. I am not a chick lit reader unless the book gets great reviews as did this. The story was fine but so predictible. I really expected more based on other reviews."
1,I actually lost brain cells reading this book.,"One of the worst books I have read in years. I actually believe I lost some brain cells. What a waste of time. Clearly, I am in the minority here, but it was trite and predictable. It was as if the author went back to every ""chick lit"" novel and ""chick flick"" movie she had ever seen, pulled all of the eccentric characters from them, and dumped them into this crappy book in hopes that women would love it. Here's a ""zany"" sample: Women salting their vaginas in a group setting as part of celebrating their feminine side (yes, you read that right.) Here's another one: ""Strong, lithe, commanding, tough-looking Dean Garrett strutting across the room, running his hands through his hair in agitation, was sex in motion."" Really? C'mon . . . I'm smarter than that, and so are you. Spend your time and money elsewhere, unless you're interested in a Harlequin Romance book hidden under this cover."
4,Great story about love lost and found,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this book was. From the beginning I was laughing out loud and at the same time felt for the main character's situation. The cast of 'characters' was unique and not predictable which made it more interesting to want to get to know them the better.The only predictable part was Julia playing hard to get, understandably after being hurt and not trusting, but all love stories have that same pattern we all are used to. The other stories and characters gave it some substance.If you liked The Knitting Club this one is even better. They both have similar genre involving a group of women dealing with and overcoming their life situations.Enjoy!!"
4,Mouthwatering,"Cathy Lamb's debut novel happened to be my debut with Cathy Lamb's novels. And what a great debut! This book is filled with characters who alternately make you laugh and cry (or better yet, cry because you're laughing so hard). And the dialogue is quick, witty, and wicked. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, and had a hard time not only putting it down, but seeing it end."
4,Great read,Great book with lots of wisdom and insight. It will keep you hooked and surpise you with each page you turn.
1,"Predictable, Boring, and Irritating","Don't bother with this book. The characters are not developed, they are all predictable, and every single scenario is a cliche. This book wasn't even about chocolates! I thought it was more about Julia working in a library and meeting her ""dream man"" (rolling my eyes). There was no complexity to this book at all. Every time you get excited and think something, ANYTHING is going to happen and actually be developed...nothing happens. I didn't laugh either...there's nothing funny in this book. And I just wonder how I'm supposed to believe an abused woman comes to a town where, coincidentally, all the friends she makes are abused women as well. Stupid, stupid book."
1,Awful book!,"This book was AWFUL! If you want to read graphic details about women stuck in abusive relationships and how abusive men treat them, this is the book for you. I also found the part of the story line about women meeting up to undress and talk about/look at their privates parts just too weird. I don't know what page I stopped on, but I don't think I made it to page 100. Don't waste your time or money. It deserves no stars, but I think you have to give it at least one to write a review."
4,Truly feminist literature,"I enjoyed this book and have passed it on to a friend. It is feminist and funny. Sexual abuse of children is woven into it and the difficulty in finding love with a good man after all that abuse. There is friendship, courage, love, loss, and a happy ending."
4,Julia's Chocolates,"Julia's Chocolates was an easy and fun read... fun, as in ""laugh out loud"". I can't wait to read another book by Cathy Lamb."
1,ZERO stars,"ZERO starsOne of the worst books I've ever read; I finished only because I needed it for a couple of challenges.Julia Bennett has left her fianc√© on her wedding day, driving cross-country to her Aunt Lydia's home in rural Oregon, where she will bond with Lydia's circle of women friends who enjoy regular Psychic Nights. The characters are all one-dimensional; here's a sample description of the women: ""A psychic with a twitching eye, a bald woman chasing down her guns, and a mermaid-type mother crying."" As for the men, they are either tall, handsome gentle giants or mean, evil, violent abusers.And then there's the whole ""Faux-Bohemian pseudo-feminist psychobabble"" thing. How about this sage advice: ""If you're confused, summon the strength in your breasts, ask your estrogen for answers, demand that your femininity give you advice.""I rolled my eyes so often I made myself dizzy."
4,Realistic,"This book was a wide expanse of characters that you grew to love. The author led you through with the central character to a new awakening leaving behind an acoholic mother with many boyfriends and a controlling, abusive fiancee. The central character was very brave when she left her wedding dress in the tree and started forward without a planned goal. People tend to put up with what they have rather than advance into the unknown. So often people are abused and will not leave the abuse because they cannot accept what they cannot see. The aunt was a delightful eccentric who pulled the central character into a world that allowed her to grow as a person and to heal from the abuse."
4,Julia's Chocolates,"Cathy Lamb has created another wonderful reading pleasure. It is funny, brave once you start you are confronted with an entire batch of new friends and you will not want it to end!! After all, how many of us have wanted to hang your wedding dress on an old tree and take off!It is also special because I have just found Cathy Lamb as a new author plus she also is from Oregon!! We are so proud of her accomplishments!Thank you Cathy Lamb!!Wanda"
1,Julia's Chocolates,"This book was a total waste of money. It is not well written, and the story line so boring I couldn't finish this book. I gave it 90 pages and then gave up. If you read at a college level and love good writing pass this one up for something more stimulating and believable."
1,Trite and so unrealistic,"When I bought this book, it had nothing but 5-star reviews, so I was really looking forward to it. I was so disappointed. This book is one of those highly oversimplified, sappy, fairy tale type books where the main character comes from hardships, changes her physical location, and her enitre life changes. Everyone sees her worth the instant they meet her and love her immediately, everyone she cares about is the most exceptionally gifted person at whatever they do. Nobody judges superficially as they used to, and the main character now suddenly has the power and fortitude to stand up to all wrongs and give so many gifts to the world.I honestly just found the writing ludicrous and the storyline laughable. If you are looking for a story with some substance or realism, skip this one. If you just want some immature girly fluff, this is the book for you."
2,Unexpectedly poor...,"I was very surprised to be completely disappointed by this book. It was a poor cross between ""The Divine Secrets of the Yaya Sisterhood"" by Rebecca Wells and ""Chocolat"" by Joanne Harris. Both of these wildly popular books had a unique way of capturing the spirit of the characters. Yet, ""Julia's Chocolates"" fails to deliver that sense of knowing the people you are reading about. This novel seems to take elements from both of these books, and mishmash them together, to create something lesser than either.The characters are more like caricatures, and none seem fully developed. Each one seems to be 'putting on a play', but not establishing themselves.I wanted to love this book, and kept plugging along, even when it became repetitive and predictable. I wish I could say it ended better than it began. The beginning few pages were the best in the novel."
4,"Quirky, violent & inspiring - not a light summer read","Overall I liked this book, but certainly see why some have not. It is schlocky & unbelievable in spots, especially seemed hard to believe that she (a college grad, seemingly in touch with reality) didn't know her ""Dread Disease"" episodes were panic attacks. I'd have liked it more if it was quirkier & less violent, but I did find it to be inspiring.Reminded me quite a bit of Sarah Allen Addison's ""Sugar Queen"", I probably like Sugar Queen better."
4,A Tasty Treat,"This is a fast moving tale with likable characters. They are eccentric, but very likable, and I enjoyed it very much.."
5,Best Toy Ever,"I am rating this toy based on its ability as an mp3 player,I don't know about the online barbie world.This is a great mp3 player.And its not just for little kids.Its realy easy to operate,and transferring music to this mp3 player is super easy.Be aware that it is not compatible with mac. It has buttons on it where you can fast forward, rewind, play, pause, and the volume controls.The volume doesnt go up very high and you can't view the song that you are listening to.It comes with ear phones with adjustable sizes,and it has different outfits that you can mix and match,the price is very affordable and over all it is a great mp3 player."
4,Barbie Girls MP3 Player,"Our last Birbie Girls MP3 Player only lasted about 8 months until the sound no longer worked in one ear, but at these prices it's worth it for my 10 year old girl to buy another, she really enjoys the website that she has access to when she buys the MP3 Player."
3,Frustrating experience with the barbie website,"Let me get this out right away. The MP3 player works just fine. But my daughter was equally looking forward to a ""free 1 year subscription with premium content"" to www.Barbiegirls.com., a kid safe online community.Just connect the device to the computer and visit the website and the rest is almost automatic. Or so it was supposed to be. We were utterly unable to connect the device successfully and redeem the membership promise. Worse, the website forgot my daughter's user name and password for the lower tier membership after only a couple days use. My daughter is trying to be a big girl and control her disappointment, but I am frustrated too.It is going to be multiple helpings of hassle trying to get the website problems ironed out.Thank goodness the actual MP3 player works without a problem"
3,Great for young music lovers.,"My 8 year old daughter recieved this toy as a birthday present, and she really enjoys listening to it. The volume does not go up very loud, so I do not have to be concerned that she could damage her hearing.The only issue is the toy's durability. We are currently on our third player in less than a month's time. The first player simply didn't work at all. I exchanged it for a second that worked for about two weeks then just fried. I was able to exchange the second for yet another player. I just hope this one lasts a little longer. If you do purchase this toy, be sure to keep your reciept."
2,we had high hopes,"we had high hopes for this mp3 player. my 9 year old daughter saved her money and bought herself this. it DOES NOT work with subscription services like itunes or napster. you are going to have to purchase tracks. even after i purchased songs from walmart site, we couldn't get them to stay on the player. also the player kept turning off every few seconds even after fully charged. this thing is cute though. cute accessories to go with it but we are returning for one that is compatible with napster. it's just easier that way. my daughter was heartbroken."
4,Daughter Loves It,"My 7 year old daughter wanted this toy and finally received one.The software and player were very easy to set up and due to her extensive CD collection already, within the hour she ripped and loaded it full of High School Musical, Daughtry and some Fleetwood Mac.Considering the value of the toy for the price, I'd recommend this easily. It had about 500MB of open storage by default and with a spare mini-SD card I had laying about, she was up to 1GB in no time."
1,Very unhappy,"I am having and have had a very hard time getting music on the player. It is not very loud, does not work like it should for the money I had to pay for it. I tried to return it and was told no it had been to long. I brought it early because of Christmas. SHe did not get it til after the time had expired for refund. CRAZY. NEVER WILL I BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN"
5,For a 3 year old!,"I got this for my three year old and she loves it and it is very simple for her to use. It holds about 150 songs, more if they are short like most of the kid ones!"
5,Excellent Little Known Leslie Nielson Film!!,"Frank Dayton(Leslie Nielson)leads a group of crooks to steal one and a half million dollars from an Air Force Base with an awesome climax.Also,Co-star Laine Kazan sings superbly!!This is an excellent,little known Leslie Nielson film!!"
3,"OK, but a little biased","I found this a very useful book for planning our trip to Disney but it's ties do Disney made it seem a little biased. Being the only ""Official"" guide, I get the sense that it had to be approved by Disney. It gives some very helpful hints about things to see and descriptions of the attractions. However, it didn't seem to criticize any rides and having been to Disney World four times I know there are things worth avoiding. There have been other guide books that will tell you what to avoid and what is worth seeing. Whenever it comes time to plan a trip to Disney, any book is a fun read and gets you excited about the trip, but this one doesn't top my list of objective travel guides."
2,Too Biased,"I used to enjoy this guide, but since I read Bob Sehlinger's ""Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World,"" I will never trust Birnbaum again. Sehlinger doesn't play nice, while Birnbaum is required to, given that he has Disney's ""official"" stamp of approval. Meaning: Every attraction is worthwhile. Disney resorts are the only way to go. And don't even THINK about other offerings in the Orlando area (most famously, the Universal Parks). I don't think so.It's interesting to note that when Universal Studios Florida was in its infancy (circa 1991), Birnbaum included a page at the very back of the book concerning the park. Circa 1996, there was no mention of it. I guess The Mouse nixed it. (Should you be planning a trip to Orlando, by the way, check out the Universal Parks. They're out of this world.)"
3,It's An Inside Source Alright....,"Inside source? You bet it is. A biased marketing guide disguised in the form of birnbaum. There is just, a slight, bias here. 100% positive spin approved and edited by Disney, the corporate playground designed to separate to part you from as much money as possible.With ""insider tips on how to save money?"" It's officially the only official guide. That means that honest information won't entirely be presented. It's not Birnbaum's Guide, it's Walt Disney's Guide. As long as the people who buy this realize this, that's fine. If you aware of this but it doesn't matter, you deserve to spend more than needed. If your unaware that this guide is cut through Disney, you deserver to be suckered. All in the ""corporate family entertainment."""
5,Haven't needed yet,Haven't used yet BUT when I need it I will have it. Patches can get trapped in a berrel if you don't have a puller well it's just stuck there.
5,New phone service or upgrade,This was a GREAT and inexpensive way to get new phone service! I was able to read all about the plan and pick the one that was best for me and my family. The phones cost me 1 cent for three phones. The phones were brand new and worked wonderful. I saved so much over going to a store! Don't let the store fool you. They will tell you they are giving you the best deal but you pay more at the store! Amazon is almost free! I have also done upgrades for one penny at Amazon.
5,WELL ROUNDED,A WELL ROUNDED BOOK THAT GIVES INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO AVOID INTEREFERENCE WITH HOSPITAL STAFF ALONG WITH BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES TO HELP THE PATIENT. A GOOD RESOURCE FOR THOSE WHO VISIT THE SICK IN HOSPITALS.Boundary Wars: Intimacy and Distance in Healing Relationships
4,Shoegazer fuzzpop,"Good album. This band should do well on the Indie Rock scene. Guitar is fun and trendy with good fuzz chords and stringy ""cure like"" counter melody from lead guitar. Good lyrics. Check out Gwen Mars, Echo and the Bunnymen and My Bloody Valentine for other good similar bands."
1,I need a manual for this?,"The cover price of this book would give one more than adequate funds to build a lovely incense stash and purchase a couple of cool, simple burners. Here's my book, for free: buy a bunch of incense at a shop, or at the sidewalk mon's incense table or online- be adventurous and unafraid of your own instincts. Now, burn it. Write down their names, and mark which ones you like or don't like. Don't buy the stinky ones again. How hard is that? I could see if this book told one how to make incense, and believe me, I'm a book person, but heavens, have we gotten so helpless that we need this to tell us all about how to enjoy something so simple? Proof you can truly publish anything these days."
3,Not A True Favorite of mine about incense....,"If you get this book, it DOES NOT teach you how to make your own incense. However, it only tells you how you can have incense in your life if its a stressful one. This book doesn't really tell you all the things that can also release stress as well, besides incense. Its not a book that i would recommend to someone cause its very cut and dry and very blah with its content, however, the pictures are very well done."
2,Nice Book!,"I am primarilly writing this review in response to the unecessarilly harsh review given earlier. I read that review once before and it put me off of wanting to buy this book but just recently I saw it for sale used and bought it. I am glad I did, too! This is a beautiful little book with pictures that look like they should be in a $60.00 coffee table book The content it more about the love, experience and joy of burning incense than it is a complete treatise on the subject and, to some, may be filled with a bit too much New Age sentimentality and ceremony but overall this is a wonderful, lovingly written little book that I think most people will truly enjoy. It is not really for someone with considerable experienced with incense but if you are just getting into incense I think this is probably the best book available."
2,Not COMPLETE,"As it turns out, the title of the book is a bit misleading. The C model installation and/or removal of the right side cartridge stop is completely ignored. The left side cartridge stop is covered in detail, but it's a completely different critter than the stop used on the right side. Also, the DVD picture quality is not good, especially on a large display. The DVD is a poor quality copy from a VHS tape that needed better production techniques from back when it was produced. Having said that, most owners will find several hints and secrets in this production that are quite valuable. Since this DVD has no competition in the subject of 1897 Winchester shotguns, it's this one or do without."
2,Dr Gaster forgets very important words that make it powerful,"At first the cover was beautiful and then I read it. He even states clearly that he was lazy and did not want to translate the names because they were encoded. Without those words, it's nothing more than foolish reading. He totally removed the magical abilities from the text. Perhaps on a later date, he'll finish it."
3,Intelligent Choice,"I must agree that the author left out very important Divine Names vital to the book as a whole, yet I believe that he was justified in doing so. Perhaps what the actual manuscript contains is so powerful that it is meant to be hidden. I think this was a very intelligent choice by the author, though I'm sure by doing so many people find the book useless."
3,The Sword of Moses,"J Pedro Feliciano? Hi JOse' LOLROF this is Alister Crowley's smarter brother. Didn't you write ""The Trumpet of Moses""?You said you bought The Sword of Moses and were disappointed that Gaster, for some obscure reason, omitted nearly all the magical and divine names. And you hoped some day a new version of The Sword of Moses would be published, containing the entire text. Well the 1973 and the 1970 printing have the complete translation. Your 1989 paperback appearently was circumsized by an intoxicated Rabbi on the day of printing.The translation done by Moses Gaster was published by London in 1896. I have a hardback copy printed by Weiser in 1973. It is complete. I have found it quite satisfactory."
1,same blade available for fraction of this price at amazon!,"look elsewhere for the same blade, you can get a 3 pack of em for far less than 90 odd dollars these vampires are charging for one.!!!why does amazon allow this to happen? caveat emptor! (that means 'buyer beware' )"
4,Great little frying pan,My fiance and I have been using this little frying pan several times a week for the past month and so far it's been great! It's easy to clean and is a complementary match for our Circulon Toss and Turn Pan. It feels sturdy and cooks evenly.
1,Don't buy this item!,This skillet is very small! The 8-inch is measured from the top of the Skillet so it's too small for any type of cooking! Don't buy it!
2,Not Enough,"I must advice to the potential Sys Admins lookin to sit for the certification exams , that this book is certainly not Enough. Coz certain chapters Like ""Backup and restore"" are not extensively covered considering the scope of the exam. By all means you need another source of information."
5,wealth of information,"This book contains not only an up to date list of the material covered in the Solaris 9 exams, but also a lot of practical information valuable to anyone using Solaris 9. The author gives the reader a knowledge of the tools needed to use a Solaris system more effectively. Questions at the end of each chapter enable the reader to assess their skills in each test area, and the CDROM based testing tool provides the look and feel of the actual exams. I have also tried the Exam Cram book, but find this one to be muchmore thorough in preparing me for the exams."
5,cutting down the ribs,it's the most entertaining collection ever put together. I will love to give it a try.
4,Great toy,My Son spends hours loading up the bucket with anything from Cheerios to rocks and delivering them to their destination. We have had to reassemble the crane from time to time which is easy to do. Some of the small plastic parts have snapped off the buckets which have been hard to reattach even with my favorite Superglue!
4,Great ministry tool,I use this book to explain to children and through them to adults about what baptism is. It has good theology. Unfortunately it's a bit US Lutheran specific but apart from that it's a great resource and the kids enjoy it. (So do the adults.)
4,Joe Pass Jazz Guitar,"The Book is in excellent condition and will be of great value to me in the future. Unfortunately, it is several levels above my current skill level, and I am not ready for it yet. This of course, is my mistake and I have no complaints."
4,"Good, BUT not great.","I liked this book, but I was not excited by this book. Traviss has fallen prey to the Stackpole-Zahn trap of only being able to write Star Wars books that envolve their favorite/invented character. She has to write about Mandos. So what better way then to envolve Boba Fett. The Boba Fett story was a good one, but I spent most of the time thinking what does this have to do with the main story line. It is resolved somewhat abruptly at the end. At times it was distracting from the main story because it seemed to be more fleshed out. I wonder (and hope) that Fett continues to play a part, but not at the expense of a truly interesting story about the transformation of Jacen. Overall this it a good read and EU fans will enjoy it. By the way KOTOR fans will enjoy a reference in this book."
3,No Empathy (spoiler ahead),Ugh. I am actually eager for Jacen Solo to meet his end. Must we suffer another pass at the Hero Unable to Handle Ambiguity story again?
4,Reaching darkness,"Life turns full circles even in the galaxy of Star Wars. To watch the collapse of yet another brilliant star is tragic indeed. "" Sad this one is"""
4,My son loves this series!,My son has really enjoyed reading this series of books. Gives great insight to the movies. Would recommend to kids and adults alike.
1,Poor book in a terrible series,"The characters in this book often make decisions that make no sense based on their values or past expereinces. I wonder if the authors in this series have read or care about the Star Wars universe. This book and the others in thie series seem bent on old allies becoming enemies and killing or attempting to kill each other. Luke tries to kill his nephew, Luke's nephew kills Luke's wife and tortures Luke son and on and on it goes. The inclusive of Bobba Fett and his ""family"" seems almost a ""nice"" diversive compared to the Jedi trying to kill one another."
4,Well written and readable,"I wasn't crazy about the first book, ""Betrayal"", basically because I needed a magnifier to read it, since the font was so small. However, if the print was larger it would have been probably over 500 pages, which would have made the book too long (and it was too long anyway).This book, ""Bloodlines"", was much better and smoother. I disagree with some of the criticisms that Luke and others were in denial over Jacen's turn to darkness. Luke and just about everyone else (except Mara) was keenly aware of Jacen and quite suspicious about it. But a war was on and everyone was involved in their own way and role, which explained how Jacen was to change. This is the first Star Wars novel I've read from Karen Traviss, and I plan on reading more from her."
1,Worst Expanded Universe story line yet,"I've had the pleasure of reading several dozen of the Star Wars Expanded Universe books. This was the first one I actually had trouble finishing. It is dark and throughly depressing. If this is where the EU is going, I'm not following. I'll stick to the books before this series in the chronology. If you care about the Star Wars main characters, avoid this book and the series entirely.On the other hand, if you are a great fan of Boba Fett, you'll probably enjoy his return. The expansion of his character was the only worthwhile part of the book."
2,Definitly my least favorite in the series.,"It was hard to follow, and didn't really have much to do with the past book. This author also made one of my favorite charecters, Boba Fett look really bad. It was the only book in the series that I didn't really enjoy. You will probably have to read it if you want to know what is going on in the series, but it won't be the most enjoyable time of your life. I got very bored of this book really fast."
1,old,"Old, outdated, for the newbe. If you are just getting started backpacking this book may be ok. Veary basic."
4,"Semi-nice history of the politics involved, but a dud otherwise.","Lacks most of the statistical data, such as; the EEW,or Empty Equiped Weight, weight of pay load, etc. Few nice charts, but printed too small to read well."
3,works great good price,I use these as bike gloves as well as weight gloves and they work well. This is my first pair of mesh and I like the airy-ness of them..
5,Excellent Gloves for wheelchair or bike riding,"I purchased these they are great, wear well and well worth the money, I highly recommend them, First I used them for my manual wheelchair, I no longer need a wheelchair so now I use them for bike riding. They are very comfortable and fit great."
3,"nice gloves, poor quality","These gloves have ample padding and grip, but instead of leather between the fingers there is a nylon material and after the first use the stiching between the nylon and the leather started to unravel."
3,Awesum gloves for work outs .,"The gloves are good in use but they lack looks , but are great for weight lifts . The stitching of these are little bit loose , but they do the job.....!! The padding at the palm is very less , good for beginners . and the price is just awesum.....!! The stitching at the fingers curls when u try to weight lift , that's the problem with these gloves..!! but still i luvvv them ... i would recommend this to a friend... :))"
2,Uncomfortable on the fingers,"I bought these for weight lifting at the gym and for the first 2 or 3 uses they were fine. I don't really like the mesh on the back (I think that it just looks a little dumb). But the real problem came after a few uses the fabric at the end of the fingers started to roll and form a little ball between my fingers at the bar. It might not sound like a big deal but when you get enough weight on the bar it really hurts and I find myself having to stop reps short and adjust the fingers several times eah time I work out. I will admit that I have somewhat small hands and that my fingers are not really thick, but for that reason I bought a medium size and the fit seems good until I start lifting."
5,Gets the job done!!!,"off the chain good product good price. It helps protect my hands from the harshness of the gym equipment, i love it !"
4,Great fit,They look and feel great. I will get a lot of use out of this pair of gloves. Nice amount of padding for my barbel workouts
5,Good,They seem to work fine for what I need them for. The velcro strap comes in handy too. They definitely keep my hands from getting ripped up on the chin-up bar!
2,Runs Large,"The mesh is stretchy and the leather is pretty big. I ordered a medium and should have gotten a small. The leather section is way too large for my hand. I have athletic hands, narrow but not small -"
3,Love the mesh and white goes with everything.,"I ordered these gloves in white because I wanted something different than black. They are excellent on helping to prevent callouses on my hands and the mesh is very breathable.Sizing: They are on the small side. I used the measurements they provided and it said I was a medium. When they arrived they fit around the palm of my hand, but its tight around my wrist. Next time I will order a large."
5,"Excellent Quality, Excellent Price",This was exactly the type of lifting glove that I was looking for because it matched the style of glove that I had previously. If this is the style of lifting glove that you are looking for you will find that these are an exceptional deal. After one week of use they prove to be very durable and offer cushioning in just the right places so you can focus on the amount of weight you are lifting rather than the toll that weight takes on your palms. I was also impressed with the speed of delivery. I am a soldier currently serving in Iraq so it was important for me to be able to have it delivered to an APO address.
2,Started coming undone after a few weeks,"There are better gloves out there. These started to come undone after a few weeks. And they weren't very comfortable compared to other gloves I've used. They have nice padding (which it why I gave them 2 stars) but if you are looking for something that will last awhile, these are not the gloves for you. Keep looking."
1,Valeo Gloves,These gloves were a piece of crap no padding at all and also it wasn't even that big for an extra large this is an example of why going expensive is sometimes the best idea
3,"Good, for now","I bought these as a starter pair of gloves based on others reviews. They're a great starter pair but I'm definitely seeing the wear and tear already after just a few weeks. As other people have mentioned, they do fun a bit small. I have very average size female hands and bought the medium and while they fit they're a bit snug."
4,Definitely helped with the calluses,These gloves really helped with calluses on my hands.I do a lot of weight lifting at the gym and these were really handy.I have had them for about two months now and they seem to have survived the washing machine.I hope i can find the link which i can use to upload the pic that i took two weeks after i used them...hope that helps.
2,Shoddy construction,"The gloves were not put together very well. The seams were crooked, and there were a lot of loose threads in the seams. In my opinion they would not have lasted very long, but I will never know because I returned them."
2,Kinda lame,"Good:1.) They fit well (medium) and cover enough of the fingers to protect them from heavy weight lifting.2.) The mesh back keeps hands from getting too sweaty.3.) Durable. Had them for a few months. Use them about 1-2 times per week.Bad:1.) The mesh back is not very comfortable.2.) The mesh back does not look cool enough for me. Has a lame 80's look if you ask me.3.) Padding is on the light side. Doesn't do much for 35lbs+ dumbbell.4.) The gloves had a funky smell since receiving them and has not gone away.5.) Strangely, although durable, the materials that make the gloves feels cheap."
2,Eh...They're ok...,"Good for the price, but I'll definitely shell out the extra bucks to get a higher quality next time.Not highly recommended for anyone who has more than $10 to spend on gloves"
2,Disappointing,"The thread started to unravel the first time I used them. The padding is comfortable, but I don't expect they'll last for very long. Definitely wish I bought a better quality pair."
3,Cute but don't last long,These are very cute and match everything however obviously being white they get dirty quick but that was not what I found fault in. The mesh on these gloves don't withstand repeated use very well. The mesh became weak after about 4 months and ripped. I have since ordered Valeo's black gloves for women that have no mesh. So far so good.
3,not bad but fell apart within 1 year,"These gloves aren't the most comfortable, padded, deluxe lifting gloves in the world, but they are just fine for the price. Washable and so far they haven't shrunk. They do run small- I have small hands and got a medium and they fit pretty snugly.Update: they never got quite ""white"" again over the months (I lift 2x/week), which didn't bother me, but the seams also fell apart within a year. I'm going to look into those ""grip pads"" instead."
3,comfortable and lacks enough grip,"I'm a frequent lifter, lifting around 250lb-345lb per workout. I do a lot of clean and jerks, squats, etc. almost everyday. These gloves are very sweat absorbing and soft which gives a nice feel when lifting. After a few uses, the leather grip started to become very slippery like a snake skin feel due to the excessive friction caused by the bar and keeps slipping now but for the price of this glove. You cant complain i guess."
3,"For the money, I cant complain but back is starting to fray","These are cheap gloves, so dont expect to much. Their leather fronts are pretty solid, but the back messing is pretty flimsy. It had already begun to come apart after only a few uses. You can still use the gloves, just doesn't look very nice. Another thing is the finger holes have started to curl in a bit (this maybe because mine are too big) but that can get painful when you are lifting heavier weights."
5,Great,"I bought these gloves for my husband and he loves them. He said that he works out more because he has them and they fit great, and they are light."
4,Good inexpensive lifting Gloves,These gloves are great for the price- Nice and lightweight and inexpensive. I recommend them! I used them to lift weights while preparing for a Tough Mudder and they helped keep my hands slightly less calloused.
5,Love these gloves!,"These gloves are comfy, durable, and if you get the right fit won't move around. I also love the white since most lifting gloves are black. My sister was jealous of mine so I just bought here a pair for her birthday. Great product=)"
2,L = Too small.,"Given this 2 stars only because a size L looked more like an S. I'm a 24 yr old male with average sized palms and though I ordered a size up, it still barely fit. I've returned it and am ordering the leather gloves from Rex that I've been using for over a year and love (they tore recently)."
2,"Didn't help my workouts, beware sizing issues","I saw another review saying these ran small, so I ordered a large, since too small gloves would be useless. Well, gloves that are too large don't help in any way as well. The mesh feels cheap and the leather (whatever) feels lower quality than those Wal-Mart brand lifting gloves (which I can only find one of, and hence why I ordered these). I wanted gloves to help for deadlifts, which hurt my hands sometimes. Instead, they make my grip even worse, but aren't worth returning so I'm stuck with some useless gloves."
3,Basic,They serve the purpose and were cheap enough. I've seen others since that are a shaped better for a woman's hand. I'll wear these out before I buy another pair.
1,Horrible,"Horrible quality, run big, tough, and the mesh is ugly and rough. Would not recommend them to anyone, male or female! Do not buy!"
2,already tearing,I have worn these a few times and they are already tearing. The padding is nice though. Not sure I would buy this kind of glove again
3,They work,"I'm a 145lbs 5'7"" female will long hands and they are a little big but they work. For the price it's ok. The mesh is a little annoying."
4,Good value for lighter gloves,"They are a bit small for the size, but they are streching nicely. The gloves are not has heavy asmy previous ones, but they are well-made and quite reasonable for the prize."
5,lifting gloves,"I selected these gloves based on the color and mesh over the top of the hand. They are extremely comfortable, breath well, and are easy to put on and remove. I wanted white so they would look less masculine."
3,Lasted 6 months,Lasted six months going to the gym for an hour 5 days a week! They are comfortable... the top will wear out fast...
1,Bad craftsmanship,"Obv at this price range one has to be reasonable with what to expect. However, one glove is completely unwearable because the index finger opening was mis-stitched and sewed halfway shut. Can't get my finger through the hole at all :("
4,"Gloves, lifting","My wife loves the design of these gloves. They do not get stinky and wet due to the breathing fabric, and are comfortable."
4,nice gloves,"not too expensive, but they didn't feel very cheap either. good for sparing me some callouses ^-^"
5,Comfortable,These gloves are comfortable. I never owned a pair of lifting gloves before. I ordered size large and I really do not have very big hands I would say normal sized. However at work I wear large gloves as well. These gloves fit great and vent heat and sweat correctly.
1,Too small,"First, I bought a large, then an extra large (XL). They did not fit so I returned them. I went to my local Gold's Gym and bought a pair of XL which fit perfectly. These gloves come very small."
4,Nice glove,"I like it, nothing fancy but does the job it is meant to do. Not think but not thin either just about right"
2,Should I return to should I risk my health to use it?,"I am satisfied the design, but I become worry about the safety issue, when I saw discover the following warning (in tiny print) on one of the product labels: ""WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" Welcome any comments."
3,good for small hands,"bought these for my bike riding, but even though I only wear a size 8 ring, these gloves were very tight in a large and they don't come any larger. Great if you have very small hands. Nice construction and looks great and very reasonable price at $8+ but run very small. would suggest men's sizes which only come in black."
2,Not impressed,"The pointer finger in one of the gloves is freakishly small.The other glove is tight and barely fits, even though it's ""extra large"".The back looks like it was knit by somebody's grandma and is not comfortable."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","Got these in September to replace the Harbinger pair that I lost. After about 2-3 weeks using them for about 3 hours a week they started fraying in the webbing, it got loose and not as tight over the hand. Also, the finger holes either stretched or lost their elasticity because it did not hug the finger any more with the fabric. Nonetheless, they do their job. But I wouldn't buy these again, you're better off getting a sturdier pair that won't fray over time."
4,Comfortable and functional,"They did what they were supposed to do. They do not trap sweat in between the gloves and your hands. My hands are tiny, but these fit like a......glove."
1,Poor Construction,"Got these gloves as a gift and I guess you might as well expect the poor quality for the low price. The right hand glove is perfect. Everything is sewn that way it should be. The left hand glove is poorly sewn. Once I put it on, it looks like a knitted blanket with hardly any of the holes visible and doesn't fit my hand the way the other gloves does. If you're looking for lifting gloves, pay about 10 more dollars for a really good pair."
4,good for the price,for the price these gloves get the job done. I have been using them for a couple months now and they do everything I expect of them.
2,Not suitable for strength training or weights,"Good:Fit is good.Bad:The gloves bite hard on fingers when lifting weight because the edges are cut blunt. As one of the other reviews has highlighted, the gloves that you receive are different from the ones shown in the picture. The ones in the picture seem to have lot of cushion on the palms but not on the actual product delivered.The leather on the palms is stiff and doesn't allow the glove to contour to the hand. I have not seen this on other gloves.The mesh on the outer side makes them look like girls biking/dancing gloves from 80's.They may be suitable for other sports like biking but not for strength training"
2,"Nice looking, but not good quality","The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that the mesh was frayed, and some stitches between the leather and the terry-cloth lining were coming apart. I had to re-stitch it, and secure the mesh with some cotton yarn I had lying around the house. They also run on the small side. I have small hands, but they're somewhat chubby, so I ordered a medium size, but the gloves are tight and they pinch my fingers, which is very uncomfortable. I don't think that anyone should have to fix something they just received, which I had to do for both gloves.I had higher expectations for this product, considering the reviews it has, but I was disappointed with what I received. I don't recommend these gloves."
3,Unique content with quality control issues.,"This collection has some shorts that are very interesting as peeks back to an earlier zeitgeist. There is a form of coarseness that runs through some of the older work, the ones that I never remember being broadcast on Saturday morning. For most of us, this is probably the only way you'll ever see them, and they're interesting. Some of the war era shorts are downright strange - by modern standards.The film transfers to video, especially for the older works, is atrocious. There was so much dirt on the film that it is a significant distraction. Cleaning film prior to transfer should be standard procedure, unless the major production concern is being cheap. The later works from after WWII and into the 50's look better. However, you've also already seen them."
3,"Some truly great cartoons, but a lot of filler too.","There are some really great cartoons in this set, especially the one-shots like Rocket-Bye Baby, Wild Wife, Chow Hound, The Hole Idea, etc. Unfortunately, WB has continued their trend of adding filler cartoons that they began with volume 3 of this line. A whole disc devoted to Bosko and Buddy is inexcusable in the last set of a collection that has snubbed Foghorn Leghorn and Pepe LePew (and where's Hippity Hopper and Sylvester Jr? - one unrestored bonus cartoon doesn't cut it). So buy this if you're a WWII buff or a completist, otherwise stick with the Spotlight Collection to avoid wasting your money on a whole disc full of Bosko and Buddy cartoons."
3,Back in Time,Most of the collection was alright but Bosco wasn't our favorite and these collections are still seriously lacking the road runner and coyote. Also we would like to see more sheepdog which so far has been very few. Please give us an entire disc of road runner/coyote and sheepdog!
2,Some gems on here; crappy packaging again,"There are some great cartoons on here. A lot of filler, though. I agree with the previous reviews: Bugs, Daffy, etc. they need to complete the collection, before going into other characters.The packaging is the usual crappy digipak. Paper is a stupid medium for packaging DVDs. It wears out. The overlapping disc holders scratch the discs. Disc 4 was scratched when I got it. Many others have the same problem.Put them in plastic Amaray box!!! They actually work. And they can be made from recycled plastic. At $45-55/set these are not throwaway items. Don't sell them as such. Digipaks are cheap looking."
5,Highly Entertaining,"This collection of cartoons will entertain anyone between the ages of 5 and 95, as they embody something for everyone, and are fairly intelligent, so as to allow adults and children to be equally mesmerized. If one loves the sixties, this set will please, equally so for anyone with a dispososition toward the fifties; the themes are sometime innocent and pure, and sometimes quite tongue and cheek, if not outright pleasantly sarcastic, overall, these are remarkably entertaining."
5,H8ers Step off! WB Golden sets rock,"sadly this is the last set. I have purchased 2 of every set. One for me and one for my Dad. This doesn't have as many of the looney tunes fam as others but the ""War-time"" toons are awesome. I love that on the case it says Not suitable for children! Kids today are too soft! Hitler and the Gremlins from D Kremlin is a must see! It is unfortunate that this is it for us as we all know they could continue to produce these sets. There are other sets with more bugs, daffy, and roadrunner not to mention Sam & Ralph but all 6 volumes are worth owning!"
3,"still good, but weakest of the lot","So many reviews already, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.Love these collections. The only thing that would make them better is to make them all the main looney tunes characters and eliminate all the other warner brother cartoons. Unfortunately, this one had an inordinate amount of those and was the weakest of the collections. I don't think I recall seeing the brainwashing one yet with ""Elmer Fudd, millionaire, I own a mansion and a yacht"" so there still must be more but I wish they wouldn't just add so much ""fillers"" that I consider rather useless."
1,I paid $65 for this?,"Honestly, what did I pay for exactly. There is something majorly wrong with this DVD set. 2 out of the 4 discs are complete garbage. I thought I was going to see cartoons with Bugs, Tweety, Sylvester, Daffy, etc. Instead, all I get is cartoon after cartoon of German / Nazi banter and WW II crap. They should rename this Looney Tunes WW II edition.... not Golden Collection. It's a waste of $. Don't bother."
3,takin' in by packaging.,If you look at the packing you would think that it's WB's war cartoons and yes there are some of the good ones but that's only the second disc the other three are just generic looney tunes and they're great but I want more of the war era cartoons. So I'm slightly disappointed in the set.
3,Not the way I wanted it to end...,"For me, the Golden Collection sets have been a lot of fun--They have allowed me to re-connect w/ the cartoons I loved as a kid and to introduce them to my children. And some classics I've been waiting for are in Vol. 6 (""Goo Goo Goliath"" and ""The Oily American,"" in particular).But this collection is heavy on cartoons that pre-date my experience--which, I admit, is probably a big selling point for some other fans.My biggest disappointment is that ""Design for Leaving"" (""Not the wed one! Don't ever push the wed one!"") was left out.Bottom line: I'm glad I bought Vol. 6, but I doubt we will watch as many of these cartoons as often as we watch most of Vols. 1-5."
3,Looney Fan is a bit disappointed,"I currently own volumes one through five. Many of the toons featured in this collection are the ""ancient"" creations and are not of the main Looney characters made famous by Mel Blanc. It's worth owning; but it's not something that I'd view frequently."
3,"Not bad, but BE WARNED!","I bought this through Amazon recently. I think Warner Bros. has just about exhausted material for this series, or else they don't care any more. More and more old, less funny stuff seems to be included with each new issue.My biggest complaint with this set is that many of the cartoons have commentary over them, some guy talking all the way through! I have been unable to find any way to shut it off. How annoying! Just be aware that not all these cartoons will be as enjoyable to watch as past ones. It is really annoying that they couldn't have made it optional to hear the yakking."
5,Very Relatable; Our son was mezmorized,"This DVD was a great tool to offer our son a way to see that other kids have similar experiences, questions, and fears when starting preschool. It also seemed to bring out a sense of pride for his own school. It was remarkable how much he tuned into the similaries and differences between Buddy Bear's school and his own. We also bought the book ""I love you all day"" about a mommy giving her son the reassurance that she loves him when they are together and also when they are apart (and he is at school). Each were great! Good luck. The best advice we got was 1) make sure your kid knows you think his school is a great and that you want him to be there and 2) try dropping off and setting short goals: I will come back for snack (30 minutes) then leave again and come back for Yard...etc."
2,Not To Good!!,"Although, I'm a huge Danny Gill fan, I felt that this DVD was not done well.He gave a lot of information, but did nothing to tie it all together. If you began watching this DVD knowing nothing about modes and scales, after watching it you'd still know very little.It seem like I was always saying...""Soooooo now what?""If you're thinking about learning more about modes and scales, you'd probably be better off checking out what else is available, because I'm sure there is far better info than this.This DVD just leaves you feeling even more confused!!!"
3,Nothing magical here. Automated old temperature method.,We have this for 5 years. I dont think this device is anything magical. It is just the temperature method and nothing more nothing less. I am saying this becasue from our experiance if you miss a date the device go to panic mode . It will put more yellow days all along. This is not worth 400$. I would say 200$ max
4,"interesting, subtle","A Hill Without a Name is interesting and subtle. The poems proceed through the seasons giving it an almost cyclical feel. None of the poems are slight, which, in my opinion, is a defect of much haiku written today. However, some are too long, but only a very few. In any case, I enjoyed it quite a bit."
3,They live by night / Side street,"I would have liked to submit a review on this title. Only I can't, because inside the case there was a different DVD, with a completely different noir double feature.I decided to keep it, when I saw it was interesting as well. So, it has become a funny item in my collection, with ""They live by night / Side street"" on the cover, and ""Where danger lives / Tension"" in the interior."
1,Way too big !,"The skirt is more peach color than pink ! IT IS VERY LONG AND VERY LARGE . I WEAR AN ADULT SIZE MEDIUM AND ITS KIND OF LOOSE ON ME ! I ORDERED THE SIZE LARGE FOR A 12 YEAR OLD BUT IT""S WAY TOO BIG . CONTACTED THE SELLER 2 DAYS IN A ROW TO GET PERMISSION TO RETURN IT . HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM YET ."
5,Great Customer Service,"The product description was for the striped shirt, skirt, belt & scarf. When the package arrived it was just a poodle skirt. I called Customer Service & Nicole explained that they were aware of the product descrption error. My daughter's program was less than a week away & I would not have ordered the skirt only since shipping was nearly 1/2 of the cost of the item. Nicole immediately corrected the problem & sent the correct outfit. She called me the next day to confirm the item would arrive on time. This exemplifies how customer service should be handled. WELL DONE!!!The outfit is a youth large (10/12). It was slightly small, but she is in between a size 10/12 anyway so it definitely worked. The felt material is very nice and stands out on its own without needing a full slip. The poodle on the skirt is adorable & sequined."
5,remarkably wry,"more than half a century has passed since this little gem appeared, yet it stands the test of time. why? like all great humor--oral or written--this comedy of errors is firmly rooted in reality. its protagonists stand halfway between hope and fear. we understand their desires, their motivations, their anxieties because they are ours. this is the only book not written by jane austen that has prompted me, repeatedly, to laugh aloud. besides its surpassing treatment of the ever-present human need and struggle for security and comfort, this slender volume also serves as a period piece: in the personage of mrs. blandings, the author quite unintentionally paints a picture of the dominant view of women, in the age before liberation, as fanciful, frivolous, and helplessly dependent. if you check your gender at the door, you'll find this delectation well worth the reading."
3,An Amusing Period Piece,"After 60 years this book is still amusing. And it still ought to be read by anyone building a house because its all too accurate. However, it really does feel like a period piece of 1940's New York manners and writing (which it is.)"
4,The last of Y&T's greats,"""In Rock We Trust"" is an album I can recommend without hesitation. It is one of my favorite albums, though I know it's not without its faults, few as they may be.""Rock And Roll's Gonna Save The World"" is yet another great leadoff track, and the hit ""Don't Stop Runnin'"" is one of my favorites. To paraphrase George Carlin, you don't have to be Fellini to figure out the nature of ""Lipstick And Leather,"" and I'll put ""This Time"" up against any other power ballad.The problems: ""Life, Life, Life"" and ""I'll Keep On Believin' (Do You Know)"" kind of drag along a bit. Not enough that I'd skip forward, but enough that it kind of slows the pacing of the album.It isn't their best, but it's in the top four. Very much worth purchasing."
1,Genuine Houserockin' Christmas,"I bought this CD for ""Stay A Little Longer, Santa"" by Shemekia Copeland. I had heard this song on the radio and I like it very much. I do not like anything else on this CD. It is really BAD. It is very hard to listen to this music other thanShemekia Copeland. I would buy more musiic by her."
3,A Very Good Basics Book,"Witchcraft, Magic & Alchemy, a great book of the basics. This collection of information gives a good foundation of witchcraft, magic, and yes, alchemy as well. Descriptions of the three sections are included in the work, as well as a semi-endepth look at the different parts, and what makes witchcraft, well, witchcraft. Try it out for atest drive, it'll answer most of your questions"
3,nope you can't cast spells with this book,thought it'd have more magical spells and stuff but it was more like a history book. It went on the never reading it again shelf.
4,Not in our Genes?,"I liked this book. It had an intricate plot and nice pacing. Dr. Chern could have used even more doctor speak as far as I am concerned.I would have liked a bit more on the other characters, but that is hard to do when the story is told from the point of view of the author.The story would have been better with fewer bodies. The author is too calm surrounded by so much death.She takes unreasonable chances.Still, I was left wanting more.Excellent first effort. Please put more stories on the menu."
3,It's ok,"Have not had it a year and the corner is peeling back. Not ""durable"" enough I guess you can say."
5,"Unusual, haunting","I bought this after a writer I know enthusiastically endorsed it in a chatroom. I loved several songs immediately, Chancellor, Starpainters and Trick Rider. I had to listen to the rest before I appreciated the originality and beauty of this entire CD. Mr. Downie is trying something new and it took a while for my ear to catch up. When it did, I was in love."
2,Interesting but extremely uneven,"Those anticipating a reprise of the turbulent hip venacular may want to give this debatable solo disc a wide berth. Clearly not the musical force behind his day gig, Downie relies on resonant background effects and airy engineering to add heft to some rather rickety compositions. Lilting ballads ""Vancouver Divorce"", ""Trick Rider"", and ""Lofty Pines"" are the keepers here, along with a sloppy garage rocker called ""Canada Geese"". The remaining songs on this drawn-out release are little more than fussed-over filler; genre pieces like ""Elaborate"" and ""Every Irrelevance"" are generic and uninspired, while the ponderous spoken-word segments - complete with Director Atom Egoyan on classical guitar - are likely to alienate any listener not incontestably enamoured with, well, ponderous spoken-word segments."
3,Excuse me? A four pack?,"I confess to being no great shakes when it comes to DIY so perhaps I am missing something here, but I would be interested to know why anyone, other than a dextrous octopus, would want to buy a FOUR PACK of 5"" needle-nosed pliers?Answers on a postcard please.Olly Buxton"
4,"""Mystery of manners""","I would call this a ""mystery of manners"". It portrays, in a credible way, Jane Austen, her siblings and her fellow inhabitants of the village of Chawton. All strata of society have representatives in this novel. The historical characters are embedded in a mystery story which is fun to read. The made up character of Lord Trowbridge, as revealed in his letters, adds spice to the novel. Some aspects of the murder of Lady Imogen strain belief, but this is not a major negative."
5,Great Book,I truly enjoyed the inside look at MLB during an era where I really became interested in baseball. It's especially interesting to look back almost 30 years since it was first published and see how some of the predictions/projections fared.Boswell is a great sports writer.
2,Not suitable for computer use,I bought this headset for use with VOIP phones. The microphone was either defective or or has the wrong impedence as the the sound had extremely low volume. Speakers did not have adequate volume from the notebook's built-in sound card. A USB sound card was able to boost the volume. Sound quality was not up to the standards of cheaper ($25) headsets. The earcups produced much echoing. Earcups have very stiff foam padding that does not accomodate to the shape of one's ears - very uncomfortable.Total disappointment. I returned these headsets.
2,Very messy,"Small children use this and even with long-handed stamps, they get their arms and hands covered in one colour whilst they are using another. And whilst it does wash off - eventually - a fair amount of soap and water is required. That said I have yet to find a stamp pad that is 'wet' enough to be easy to use, but not messy!"
2,Decent Product - Bad Shiping,"The product unfortunately came in an open cardboard box from Pakistan and it clearly banged around a bit during transport. It placed a series of dents on the tube which makes it somewhat hard to use the full range of the plunger. It still works and much more control is needed, but could have been avoided if some styrofoam or air bags were used."
3,"Good, needs improvement",It worked well when it was new. The piston becomes sticky and difficult to push after few weeks of use.
4,Ear syringe,I haven't had a chance to use it yet but the quality is just as it was advertised. The shipper did not communicate shipping date so it made it kind of frustrating. It did arrive within the specifed time however.
1,Never by from BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES.,I bought an item there is 4 month. The seller never sent the package. USPS tracking info: Status: Electronic Shipping Info ReceivedPierre a very unhappy customer and I'll not buy from Amazon.com.
3,Good but sketchy,"It gives a powerful blast of water and does a good job of cleaning the ear out. However, the product is pretty sketchy. I recommend this product with caution. I think it was new when we got it but was hard to verify for sure."
3,It's ok,No matter what you do...air will get in this. The quality is not the greatest. The pressure is not comparable with the ones at Dr.'s office.
5,a Great collection of some of Lionel's biggest hits,always been a Huge Lionel Richie fan and his videos are really cool. I've had this collection for some time now and he always made fun and feel good videos. he would give you various vibes in his videos. the songs are tight and Lionel is One of the Greatest Artist's ever. I bought all of the Back to front stuff back in 92.
5,NOT ON DVD? !!!!@@@@???!!!!,"Anybody know why this best of the Stooges, their first movie is not out on DVD??!! All of their others are!!"
2,"'Have Rocket, Will Travel' (Sony Pictures) Running time: 76 minutes","As huge of a Three Stooges fan I've been since about the age of ten, here recently was my first time I sat through this 1959 waste-of-time film. Moe, Larry and Curly-Joe do manage to scrap together a few (and, I'm talking very few) laughable scenes. But for the most part, Curly-Joe (Joe De Rita) is a total dork. At least Joe Besser had his moments - sort of wish he'd filled the role of Curly-Joe in the six Stooges feature films."
5,Moe and Larry welcom Curly Joe DeRita,"In 1957,the late Moe Howard and the late Larry Fine finished their 24-year business at Columbia Pictures,filming 190 two-reel shorts with Moe's brothers Curly and Shemp and Joe Besser,respectively. Besser quit The Three Stooges to take care of his ill wife and the Stooges continued their careers with feature films. So Joseph Wardell,aka Curly Joe DeRita became the third Stooge. In fact,Wardell was originally chosen for the third Stooge after Shemp died in 1955. But Wardell was working with another act at the time and was contractually forbidden to quit. But when that contract expired around the time of Besser's exit,Wardell again got the chance to join the team and did so. So,we see the boys visiting outer space,complete with gags,of course. There's a party at the end,and of course,pie-throwing. What a hilarious film! A must for all Stooge fans."
1,FILMY!!!,"I hate face washes that leave you skin fealing just as oily as it felt before you washed it, which is what this scrub does. I buy scrubs to clean my skin! This scrub is aweful. Maybe it does the ""anti-wrinkle"" job, but frankly I can't stand to use it more than the 3 times I tried, so I will never know. If you like a CLEAN feeling after you wash your face, go with the Clinique Exfoliating Scrub. It works VERY well, and leaves your skin feelign fresh, bare, and clean. I should have known better, if it's not broken DON'T FIX IT! ;)"
2,Not the best choice...,"I ended up trying three different camera straps for my Canon 20D (and now 40D) before settling on one. The grip I'm reviewing here got sold with my old 20D because it didn't work for me - I didn't really feel any more secure using this grip than without one at all since it only wraps around in one direction. The second grip I bought from Sammy's camera and the tripod screw mount fell out of it almost destroying my camera (bad design - it was just glued in!).If you have a Canon or Nikon SLR, I'd highly recommend the Nikon brand strap - even though it's made by Nikon, it still fits Canon cameras. It's much more adjustable, and I feel that my Camera is secure when I'm using it. Nikon makes a good quality product which is more than I can say for the other two grips I tried."
4,Get's the job done,"I use this strap with a camera that has a battery pack, so the first thing I did was remove the bottom attachment from the strap. The strap works fine, and can give an extra level of comfort when holding the camera without the neck strap on. The only issue is that mine and my wife's hands are very different in size, so we're constantly readjusting the strap back and forth. The positive being that the adjustments are easy, and hold well when in use. The downside is that for the Canon T2i, the card slot is right under the strap, so when tighter, it can be a little tougher to get the card out. (if you get photos through a card reader, or change cards often)"
2,tiny hands only,"I do have large hands but not gorilla size by any means. What I cant' do is get to the ISO wheel On top of the grip and my finger doesn't find the shutter button easily on the camera with the strap on. It may work for nimble young hands, mine have 60 years use on them. the upside is the mounting screw has a threaded hole for tripod mounting. not off center. I think I'll just keep wrapping the neck strap around my wrist like I've been doing all these years."
5,Nice hand strap for SLR,"I use a ring flash/macro lens for dental purposes. This makes the camera rather heavy. I wanted a hand strap for insurance purposes to guard against accidently dropping the camera. This hand strap works well. Easy to attach, it still allows easy access to the CF card and the battery."
4,"Functional, but difficult to install","The strap was functional, but was not very easy to install. There may have been a clip missing for it, and there were no instructions included with the strap. However, once secured to the camera with the assistance of a clip from the neck strap, it worked well."
3,ok,"received this for christmas... does what it sayes it does. only thing I'm not fond of is it gets in the way of working the zoom on my camera. I have a cannon. you can reverse it to use on either side so, if you want to use both hands it would be a go for you..."
4,Good value.,I purchased this hand strap for a Canon Digital Rebel XT and it works well. Does exactly what you'd expect and is reasonably comfortable. Strap holds well. I'd recommend it to others.
5,Bird flew through here,"I am a Charlie Parker collector, and this concert makes my collection shine even more. I'm still looooooking for some more ""bird"". Anybody know where i can find or excavate ""One night at Birdland""????????All I can say is ""The washington concerts"" is awsome, there's even an interview with red rodney...."
3,Not as good as the San Francisco recording,"Pleasant, but without the fun or soul of the San Fransico recording. Of course, it may be that I am biased by having owned that one for so long and being so fond of it . . ."
4,"Overall, very good","Just recently broke my DLO blue hard case so I needed to find a replacement. This seemed to be well-made and good fitting. I was actually surprised as to the superior quality it offered over the DLO case. It fit so much better and the material just felt better. It comes with a screen protector and click wheel protector, but I just used the screen protector. There is actually a hard plastic screen built into the case covering the ipod screen for added protection, which I thought was a cool feature, but there were specks on it. Not a big deal, but slightly noticeable, it probably doesn't come like that with every one but you never know. Overall, I am really happy with it and it looks like it will last for a while."
3,gotta love TR Knight,you have to realy enjoy stupid hummor to like this movie... its one of those total mochary flicks... if you want to see the god father mocked this is the way to go...it was a fun film to watch and of cource TR Knight (the reason I got it) was simply adorable! all an all a good watch
5,Laugh out loud off beat comedy,"I love this off beat wild comedy ala early Woody Allen only sicker, funnier and with more heart. TR Knight is great as Jeff and Danny Aiello is excellent as Pop. Buy it."
5,Nonlocal Psi Experiments,"Your skepticism will melt away as you study these experiments in Psi.Fact is stranger than fiction, we have arrived at ""quantum consciousness"", still unexplained, but functioning in many ways and many people."
3,'tude,"phat ass track, but ya gotta like dance music. hyper & repetitive, sort of like 'fired up'. It's all about the music and attitude. You'll get it."
4,"Funky Green Dogs, ""Body [Maxi - Single #1]""","""Body"" was the first single to be released from the Funky Green Dogs' second album, ""Star"". It's important to know that Tamara Wallace took the position of vocalist for the Funky Green Dogs at this point. The label, Twisted, released ""Body"" in two parts. This is the first. The Radio Edit of body is an upbeat, happy disco-dance song about physical attraction and want. The jumpy feel of the song makes one want to get up and dance. The Club 69 Future Mix (Madonna, ""Nothing Really Matters""; Cher, ""Believe""), done by Peter Rauhofer and Georg O. Luksch, follows the tribal drum pattern special to club 69. Though musically, only two chords are used throughout the piece (as a melodic backup), the mix does a relatively good job. The last track, the Ashley Beedle Sirius Red Hard Mix is a house mix, with additional lyrics.The track listing is:01. Body [Radio Edit] 3:5802. Body [Club 69 Future Mix] 7:2203. Body [Ashley Beedle Sirius Red Hard Mix] 8:28Good job."
5,Excellent for Kids,I have a 13 year old boy that has had trouble with behaviors for years. This book helps him understand that he is not the only one and talks to him in a way he can understand. We usually sit down and discuss his answers and this helps him stay focused. It also helps bring us closer together and opens the lines of communication.Wonderful!
2,jumps around too much,"This book was suppose to be designed for children that are identified as SED or ADHD, yet I found myself (as a professional) getting confused. It would mention a topic in one chapter but follow up with 'we'll read more about that in another chapter.' Not good for many of the kids this book was made for."
4,Pros and Cons,"I am an elementary school counselor who works with many children with difficult behaviors. I purchased this book because it sounded like it could be very helpful in working with the students I counsel and was presented as the only PBIS Tier 3 book on the market. It has some great information and resources but I feel that I would really need to ""rewrite"" it and ""redesign it"" in order to be used with younger elementary students. There are some great forms included in the book that you can copy and use with students. I would recommend this book for use with 3rd grade students and up. Another bonus to this book is there is a website that can be used in conjunction with this book called ""Dr. Mac's Amazing Behavior Management Advice Site"". Overall I would recommend this book for use with students 3rd grade and older."
4,Great For Little Tonka Fans,"I ordered this for my three year old son who loves anything Tonka. I was expecting an animated video. I was surprised when it arrived to find that it was actual construction equipment with voices added to a storyline.This is one of two videos available. In Scrapper's Baby Brother Scrapper the dumptruck finds himself in a dilema. It's his birthday and Scrapper has went to his work at the scrap yard. Expecting a big surprise from all the other equipment Scrapper is disappointed to find out that the only thing special about the day is having to watch his baby brother (a Bobcat loader). Keeping an eye on his baby brother becomes a big job, more than he can handle. He wishes that he didn't have a baby brother only later to find out that a baby brother is a blessing to have to have.The sound and picture quality isn't as great as with new videos. That doesn't matter to my son though. He loves the story and seeing the construction equipment."
1,what a let down,"I purchased this because I'm pregnant and my son is still nursing but my milk supply is really lacking. I read this was safe for pregnant nursing mothers and the reveiws seemed good but it hasn't helpped one bit and the taste is horrible. I would suggest buying the smaller bottle first and try mothers milk tea,I found that to be helpful."
4,Product does work,"After nursing my son exclusively for 8 months, my milk dried up suddenly when I became pregnant with my second. My son had never taken to a bottle, so I was desperate for something to help give me some milk supply back. I had heard of this product before, so I ordered it. In the few days it took to arrive in shipping, I was able to introduce my son to a bottle and formula, and wouldn't you know it- he doesn't want to nurse anymore! This product did help increase my supply- not back to pre-pregnancy levels, but it still helped, and now I nurse my son once a day 1st thing in the morning."
2,Didn't notice any improvement at all,"I was still pumping for my infant when I got pregnant again. I still wanted to continue, but I noticed that my supply was decreasing due to the pregnancy hormones. I tried everything I could to boost my supply and nothing worked, so I was so excited to find this.I didn't find the taste horrible, but I was willing to do whatever I could. Unfortunately, this didn't do anything. No increase in supply, nothing. It's an expensive product and if it worked, I wouldn't mind, but it was just a waste for me.Maybe it helps for some, but I think sometimes you just can't fight mother nature and the pregnancy hormones that may make your supply dwindle. What a shame.."
5,Well Worth The Money,"I listened to the audio, probably the best audio I've ever heard. It finally wakes you up to the reality of Doctors and why people continue to be sick. Great book, Great Audio, Smart man. Thanks Joel Wallach for opening up my mind."
5,Outstanding piece of literature,A must have for any household. Proven results time and time again from the information contained in this book.Highly valuable.
3,Money-hungry Wallach know his stuff... BUT,"Dr. Joel Wallach certainly knows his stuff. He knows the importance of minerals in diet, knows which foods to eat, and has studied long-living cultures and received his information from others who have done extensive research. What I do not like about this book is the fact the entire book is basically Wallach preaching about his supplements and his involvement in different supplement companies. His colloidal minerals are a very good, important supplement but some of his recommendations are strictly because his company happens to carry that certain product. All in all, it's a great book for someone with poor eating habits, and is in poor health. For the educated ones, you can find better material on the internet these days.. or in Robert Barefoots book ""The Calcium Factor"", which is the best book I have ever read in my life."
2,Dangerous Advise for Kidney Stones!!!,"I am a kidney stone patient, after a couple of medium stones spread over 4 years I decided to follow Mr. Wallachs advice and started with agressive calcium supplementation, like he recommends, after 2 years I ended up with two big stones [one on each kidney] and several smaller stones on BOTH kidneysIn my experience calcium supplementation only makes the problem worse, I recommended all kidney stones sufferers to look for information, according to my research magnesium supplementation would have made more sense. My stones are calcium oxalateHopefully this helps people looking for an answer on this extremely painful condition"
1,"Sorry, but it's a lot of bunk. Glacial milk and colloidal minerals are the new snake oil.","Dr. Wallach's medical quackery and multilevel marketing pyramid scams are pretty extreme. PLEASE do some independent research before relying on any information in this book. One is not entitled to their own facts. Please check sources. I'll add a couple useful links in the comments, since Amazon filters links from these reviews."
3,Take with a LARGE grain of salt...,"Makes some very wild and unsubstantiated claims... but what I did find interesting is how closely his [current] advice [in ""Live Doctors Do Lie"" tape] parallels that of Atkins, Sears and Peskin... all low-carb, hi-protein gurus."
3,Sabbath inspired garage metal,"Not a bad listen. VELOCIPEDE is a two man studio project that has doomy elements inspired by Black Sabbath in places. Christian themed lyrics on now defunct Christian label R.E.X. Can't go wrong for the .10 cent used price listed above! Give it a listen! Favorite track: ""Blue Skies"""
1,Do NOT buy a product from Unique Imports,"Amazon should not associate with this company. I don't have a problem with the product. It just did not fit a 16 inch Toyota wheel. It was too shallow, it did not have the depth to fit the wheel. First, the company should list the 16 inch wheels it will and will not fit. Second, the company should NOT charge a 10% restocking fee and return shipping, especially if they do not thoroughly represent their product and charge shipping to receive their products. Amazon, rethink your relationship with this supplier. DO NOT order ANYTHING from this company, EVER!"
5,Clinique Take the Day Off Eye Makeup Remover,"Nothing else works as well as this product. It's easy on the eyes, it moisturizes, and it's great for sensitive skin."
1,Where do I begin?,"I ended up having a pretty nasty allergic reaction to that product, but even if I hadn't I still wouldn't be happy with this stuff. It left my face greasy and gross to say the least. It also seemed to take more effort than expected to remove the makeup. I just wanted to try something new for makeup removal, but I believe I'm going to stick to my usual products."
5,Take the Day Off,"I ordered this excellent product at far under the retail store cost. It is non-greasy, yetremoves eye makeup without rubbing and leaves your eyes feeling refreshed.It's nice not waking up to raccoon eyes anymore!"
3,Eye Makeup Remover,"I tried this product and it did just what it said that it would do . . . only too well. After one use, my eye lids were ashy and overly dry. I added clinique's moisture surge to combat the dryness but started to notice wrinkles and my skin changed after the 3rd use. I returned it as I figured I didn't need anything that strong. If you do, then by all means get it. Otherwise there are other brands that do the job just as well. Neutrogena's extra gentle eye makeup remover pads worked better for me."
5,Clean,Clean and nice fit. Better than eBay. Better than waiting in line at a brick and mortar store then paying wayyy too much for the same item. Besides the local stores didn't stock then and took too long to order.
1,Waste of money and time.,"The first quarter of this book was somewhat enjoyable, but it went straight downhill after that. It seemed like he wrote the same thing over and over with little variation. And he didn't need to constantly update us on the condition of his bowels - once was sufficient. I hated, hated, hated this book, and I regret the loss of time spent reading it. Sorry for the poor quality of this review - it's kind of like the book."
4,Works well,"It's Lidocane, a pain killer. It works pretty well. That's all there is to it. Keep some in your kitchen and your shop."
1,Good for a while- FREEZES,"This player works its great efficiency in the first few attempts, sinks greatly with Windows media center edition. It gives hitches, freezes, and the key pad has become dysfunctional!!! I would examine thoroughly before investing in this item. It is a sleek player, bigger than your average player. thanks"
3,Not bad. Not great either,I only purchased this CD because I heard they were a local band.It's pretty good but nothing special. It sounds like rehashedMachine Head. The trippy parts aren't very trippy and come acrossas filler until the next heavy riff comes along. It'll collectdust along with Systematic and Machine Head's latest joke of a CD. Pretty sad commentary on Bay Area music.
1,Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! It hurts my ears! Make it stop!,"Being very open to listening to all kinds of music (and yes, that does include some heavy stuff) - I decided to borrow a friend's copy of this cd (he hated it too, by the way). I struggled to listen to any of the songs all the way through - really trying to find something good about this cd. I couldn't. It's terrible. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
2,This is a ....damn boring album....,"I really wished I had'nt wasted my cash on this album. At heart its just another washed up nu-metal album, no charicter, no real emotion, just repeditive non-sence. The lyrics stand out as one of the worst charicters of this record, with dumb mindless anthem like songs, that have about 4 words in each track. Washed up & boring, I wouldnt buy this if I were you."
5,Tyte stuff,"The minute i but this cd in i knew it was goin to be bad a**. And i was right. They have a good groove and the beats are very catchy. I recomend this to anyone who likes pantera,machine head,slayer,and korn."
5,Wow,"I have heard a lot about Skinlab over the past few years, and I finally bout this album. A mixture of everything that you could want in a metal band. A must have."
5,Pretty Good New-School Thrash!,"This CD is very good! My favorite songs are ""So Far From the Truth"" and ""Know Your Enemies"". I would reccomend this CD to fans of Machine Head and Fear Factory."
4,Hard to Explain,This band is hard to explain. It is metal and rock done with a raw emotion that comes through in the vocal delivery. The songs are very memorable and catchy. They were definitely an under-appreciated band.
5,a true masterpiece!!!,for any industrial music fan this disc is a must. slightly different versions of songs from Circle of Dust/Brainchild and worth having even if you own that disc. 5 stars!!!
2,"Nice concept, yet a shame...","Andrew Chapman is the sub-author of FF gamebook 12, 'Space Assassin'. Although the idea of casting the reader as an expert assassin was a unique touch to the character - whose mission is to infiltrate a tyrant scientist's spaceship - I found Andrew Chapman's execution of this concept very poor. While it starts off promisingly enough, it soon begins to flounder along the way. It's just not exciting nor as challenging as an assassin's mission should be. Save for some novel quirks, and a few thrilling moments, 'Space Assassin' is little more than a collectors item. Another thing, I found the end paragraph extremely disappointing - as if the author had become bored and detached from writing this gamebook altogether. One star is awarded for an original concept, another devoted to his attempt at broadening the Adventure Sheet to include Guns and Armour. Apart from that, there's not much else to credit 'Space Assassin' for."
2,Space assassain,"Space assassain starts of pretty good, with a awesome variety of equipment,guns grenades, but the bad point is that ,unlike normal fantasy books,you hardly know anything about the futre the enemies , so you are blind when you open the book, and will find it hard to survive."
4,Sarah Rules !,Sarah and her dog are two of a kind !Living with a ghost that never leaves her be and a house full of memories.Always enjoyable.
2,Not too good,"I know that this opinion is different than the one of many other people. Most people actually seem to like this book...I didnt though. It was pretty boring and -in a certain way- annoying to me. I disliked the main character, Sarah Booth Delaney. Shes simply too much of a wise guy for my taste. Another thing that other people might find charming is the ghost Jitty, who talks to Sarah Booth...for me, this was just stupid.""Splintered Bones"" is not a bad book...its well-written and the story is okay too, but all in all, its not a masterpiece."
4,Timex 1440 unisex sports digital watch,This is an excellent watch. I wanted a small easy to read watch with the date and time available while being water proof. This watch filled the bill well.
1,cheap and breaks easily,"This is not a very rugged watch. We bought this for our 9 year old, and it stopped working within a few months. A new battery didn't help."
4,Army time anyone??,"Not bad, but I hope you know Army time, 0:12 = what time is it? Who knows?Cool concept, timer, alarm clock, stop watch, 12-hour and 24-hour time. Not great, but just shy of it."
5,perfect for 8 yr old,I bought this for my son's 8th birthday and he loves it! Easy to use stopwatch and he loves the indiglo function!
3,"cute, dual time, single day&date, stop watch, timer, alarm but little loud. 2 months in - moisture covers the display",just got this today. bought this and the white one. the pic of the white looks smaller but they are of the same size. both beeps for every click of the button but the white is less louder.took about less than 5 minutes to setup. the band is rubberized and slightly translucent. looks durable. might last a couple or more of years of opening and closing. does not look less than $20. will try to wear it daily. will try to swim with it this july 4th :) update later.see pic that I'm uploading.2 months into owning it... i have worn it in the pool and beach tons of times now and now it is displaying moisture. am sad :( i loved wearing the watch. going to see if i can have it returned and repaired.
2,"Women's or children's watch, definitely not fit for Men in any way","The description is misleading for sure. This is not truly a ""unisex"" watch. The band is entirely too skinny for my liking and I do not have a big wrist. Previously bought a different style of the Timex 1440 sports watch that was listed as men's and it is more appropriately sized for Men and works great for me. I'm sure this watch will function great as mine has done but I returned it almost instantly after opening it out of the box. I would not recommend this to any adult male and possibly some Women as well. More appropriate for someone petite or children."
5,Good kids watch,Bought this as my son wanted to wear for his daily schoolday. I didn't want to buy a expensive one. He loved it and wears it daily. Very good for playful kids like my son and is well worth its price. Surely a good watch at a good price.
4,Timex,This was a great watch for the brand and price. I grew up wearing only Timex and was greatly satified with the product.
4,Swim Fan!,"I was worried that the band would be to small when I ordered it, but I had no problems with the size. i love that I can use it to time laps when I am swimming. My only complaint is that it doesn't change time easily - or like my other timex watch. Wish me luck, I lost the directions and am off to google it."
1,Didn't work,Good looking watch but I couldn't set the time. The rest of the buttons seemed to work but not the timesetting mode.
2,This isn't unisex!,"I was looking for a digital watch and I loved the price and model of this one. Although this is not a unisex watch, but woman's. It's too small for a man. Sad..."
1,do not buy!,My son wore this watch for 1 day when one of the buttons actually fell off. The next day it got wet and filled with water. Complete waste of money.
3,Nice and Light Weight,I just got this watch and it looks exactly like the picture. It is very light compared to the usual sports watches which are bulky. Looks pretty and stylish. I went through the manual and managed to set the time in around 5 minutes. I have to see how long the watch survives before the battery dies down.
1,watch broke after 2 time wearing it!,"Bought this watch for my 8 year old son for Christmas. He wore it that day and the next day, by the next night the pin to set the stop watch fell out and that part doesn't work anymore. I am very disappointed with the quality!"
2,Allergic to band,My 10 year old son got this watch for his birthday and absoulutely loved it. After wearing it for a couple of weeks though he developed a rash around his wrist where the band touched his skin. This kid has never been allergic to anything in his life. He is so dissapointed because he loves the watch but can't wear it.
2,Cheap watch of low quality,"This product has the feel and quality of a very cheap watch (don't let the picture fool you). Although the Amazon price seemed great, the watch isn't worth half the price. Save your money or spend a little more and get a higher quality watch. We returned this to Amazon."
5,Great quality at a best price,I like this watch very much. At first in November 2009 I bought Armitron sport watch. I spend over $35 on the watch. It belt broke in December 2010. And I couldn't find any other good watch in stores. So I finally decided to try out my luck on Amazon. I found this cheapest watch. I was thinking about the quality of the watch because of the price. So anyway I add it to my cart and left it there for a week or two. Finally decided to give it a try. So I ordered it and the next day it was here. It is very light very soft belt. I fixed the time without reading any instructions. Can't even feel that I am wearing a watch. I really really like the quality. I just love it. I would recommend it.My watch broke today Sunday October 21st 2012. I am looking for a new one. I have used this watch heavilly. I might have took it off only 3-4 times since I bought it. I have really used it. The watch lasted for a year.
3,small size more for a women or child,Size of the watch was deceiving. looked much bigger than it really was. I know the measurements where there but who reads them or understands the centenmeters stuff anyway. It is a very nice watch for the price but keep in mind it is a small watch. I gave it to one of my grand kids and they like it. Have bought me a man size watch from walmart.
3,"LADIES WATCH, NOT UNISEX","Unless you have very small wrists, this watch is way too small. Pay attention to the picture showing the size in millimeters, the other photographs make it look normal sized. Although I am returning it, it is a solid looking Timex watch and I was attracted to the low price."
4,A Moment in Time,"I needed a watch to wear every day - while working around the house, in the garden, while grocery shopping. This watch really fits the bill. It has nice large numbers as well as a date. It's very useful and comfortable as well. The price? Can't be beat."
5,Like the watch,"It is bigger than I think, but the size is what I just want. Easy to read the digits and easy to operate. Furthermore, the prize is good."
4,Light and easy to wear while running.,"I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for a sports watch, but especially to anyone who wants a smaller watch face and band, as well as a light weight. The watch is very comfortable to wear and I found it easy to operate and use. I have no problems seeing the numbers on the face and I was impressed by the number of different time functions. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it isn't easy to reset the count down timer. If you want to train in multiple, repeated intervals of the same duration this may not be the watch you want - personally I use the stopwatch function and pay attention to the time as I go, which works just fine for me."
2,Ugh,"This is not a unisex watch, the dial is too narrow. It's clearly a woman's watch. The band is narrow too. Would not get for ANY male."
5,I LOVE this watch,"After researching much more expensive watches online, I stumbled across this watch in Target. It was about $15, and does everything I wanted: a timer, a stop watch, completely waterproof, an alarm clock, and a plastic band. It has the indigo light too. It is a perfect ""mommy"" watch because I never have to take it off when I am in the shower or bathing the kids. I can time my kids to get things done which they enjoy. I have had it for about six months. I waited to write the review to make sure it lasted. It has. My only complaint is that the buttons are hard to push, but for the price, I am extremely satisfied."
4,Great Watch!!,I got this watch for Christmas a couple of years ago. When I have watches they always get lost within six months of purchase. But since this watch is waterproof the only time i ever take it off is in the shower. My only complaint is that in the water if a button is pushed water seeps in. Otherwise I would recommend this watch over any others!!!
1,Don't buy if you need a water resistent watch,"This is a great little watch, if you treat it right. Perfect size and colors for a young boy (9 years old), but it is NOT waterproof. My son wore it in the bath tub and it is ruined. The alarm is going off randomly, the lens is all fogged up and now the digital readout is completely funky and incorrect. If you don't plan on taking it in the water, however, it is a great little watch. I am giving it a one star because Timex advertises it as water resistant to a depth of 165 feet. It clearly is NOT."
1,Didn't work,"Five minutes after setting the time, the watch had already fallen behind by two minutes. We reset the watch and waited ten minutes and the watch was behind by five minutes! Now it is behind by a full twenty-four hours. Also, the numbers would randomly flicker and disappear. Very disappointing for our eight year old!"
4,"My Son Loves it , very sturdy",Got this for my son for Christmas and he's worn it everyday since then. I'm sure it won't last as long as it should as the strap is cheap plasticky stuff but for $10 I'm sure we can replace it.
5,A great gift for a 9 year old boy!,"I loved the way my Grand Son's eyes lit up when he saw the watch.And, his first comment was-- I thought it was going to be too big.Oh yes, it's the perfect size watch for a child his age.After looking at many other watches, it was such a relief for me to find this watch from a trusted brand."
2,"Not pretty, but it works","CONS:- Its small. I don't care what the description says, this is a women's watch, not unisex.- It beeps on every button press. Its very loud and you can't disable it.- Its not very pretty. The silver area around the watch face in the product picture is actually chrome plastic, and it makes it look really cheap. This is probably my biggest problem with the watch. The product picture makes it look better than it actually is.- Can't review your lap times on the stopwatch.PROS:- Cheap (you get what you pay for)"
1,i'm a big man with a girl watch,"When I bougth it. the description was a unisex sport watch, but is so small that looks great on my 5 years old son."
1,unhappy camper,"after recieving the watch. which came on time, my son now tells me that the light does not work anymore. i have not had this product for more than a few wks. if thats the quality of the product. i would not recomend it to anyone."
4,nice youth watch,"Bought this for my son's b-day. He loves it. He treats it very well so not sure I can comment on durability. he loves using the alarm feature to remind himself of responsibilities at school. great price, no hassel. happy with it."
2,Expected Better Quality,"We ordered this watch for our son for Christmas. It's his first watch and he was very excited to get it. However after just a few weeks, the upper right Start/Stop button fell off! The piece is so small he didn't realize it was missing, and he stopped wearing it because it wasn't working. We order our presents well in advance to be prepared for the holidays so we can't return it to Amazon ($^@*#) and Timex charges 50% the cost of the watch if we send it back to be repaired. Frustrating. A $20 watch should last a kid at least a year or two, right?"
3,Expected a little more.,"Being a unisex watch i thought the face would be bigger, its the size of a females watch. Serves the purpose."
2,Not for a man....,"Nice looking watch described as unisex. But when I got it, I decided that no self-respecting man would wear it. Gave it to my daughter."
3,"Works great, but not for men.","So I got this watch for an upcoming trip I have and when I opened the box I was greatly disappointed. The term ""Unisex"" does not apply to this watch. From the small wrist band and small face, to the glittery face and small print, it does not make a good mens watch. On the other hand the watch works fine, its very easy to set and change the time and it keeps the time very well, but I will probably end up giving it to my niece. If you do want a better watch I would recommend the Timex W89 Ironman, it is definitely more expensive but it will last a life time for an athlete or anyone. To Finalize, Men do not get this watch unless you've seen it in person."
1,Worked well for a few weeks...,"This watch is simple, but I just needed it for a trip out of country and other basic uses. It held up well for a 2.5 week trip in Africa with only a few scratches on the front. I didn't pay much for it, so I knew it would have some bumps and bruises. It also served as my alarm every morning without fail.Upon returning and going in the pool a couple of times the glass began to fog up. A day later it is no longer working. It switches between setting the date and time. It will give off periodical beeps, and none of the buttons respond when pressed. Although it is an inexpensive, I expected it to last for more than 3 weeks of use."
1,Couldn't set time,The instructions were easy enough but the watch would not respond when I pushed the buttons. It says to hold the 'set' button for 2 seconds and the seconds will begin flashing. Some of the time it did that but the hours would never respond when I hit 'mode'. I worked with it a long time and then finally returned it.
4,Beautiful watch,"It is practical, easy to use and cheap. This watch was a gift for my son and he liked"
3,Decent; missing a couple key features,"Overall, this is a reasonable cheap plastic digital watch. It tells the time and date. It can do alarm and timer and stopwatch. I like the strap; it looks more robust than some.It's missing a couple of important (to me) features that the slightly-more-expensive ones have, though. Specifically:* You cannot decrement, only increment. If you want to set the time back by one hour, you have to hold the button down as the watch cycles through the other 23.* The watch beeps at every press of a button. This cannot be turned off."
4,"Good watch, it works, but looks cheap",I give these watches to less fortunate kids because the cost is low. I buy may brands and styles from time to time. This one just looks cheap.
5,Simple design,I bought this for my Nephew and he liked it very much for its size and simplicity. I recommend this for boys below 15.
4,Brother loves it!,"I bought this watch for my brother's birthday last year and must've ordered two by accident, because he tells me now (a year later) that he got TWO. Turns out it worked for the better, since after he lost one, he just took the second one. Now, he goes everywhere with that watch. To sleep. Even in the shower. He looves how its waterproof!Great purchase overall :)"
2,Unisex?,"I'm sure the watch is fine. I don't know, I'll never use it. It's called a unisex watch, but the face is really small. I think they should go ahead and call this a woman's watch. I showed it to friends and they agreed. Again, a fine, cheap sports watch, I'm sure. But, if you are a guy, I would keep looking."
5,great watch!,"I lost this the first time and ordered the same exact one again - this watch is great - reliable, resistant, and worth every penny!"
3,Good watch with a couple flaws,"Good watch for kids. Durable and waterproof. 2 flaws, though:1. It's impossible to find replacement bands. When the plastic band gets old and cracks, you'll have to throw the watch.2. To replace the battery, you have to take the band and put it back on, which is a royal pain for this watch."
3,smaller face than I thought,"My wife needed a waterproof watch for swimming. I wear a Timex IronMan watch, which has a big face and jpir;y beep function. The watch I got has a much smaller face than I expected. It is a good Timex, with date, stopwatch, indiglo, and an alarm. This makes a difference because we are both vision impaired, and we like bigger numbers."
5,"""MeAnT FoR EaCh OtHeR""-TULIPS","Don't Die, My Love. . .made me cry. . .laugh. . .and wonder. . .it is a GREAT love story that will touch you and create a warm and special place in your heart. . .because of this book. . .my favorite flowers are TULIPS. Sometimes you wonder. . .if there are any people who are as in love as JULIE and LUKE were. . .they shared a TRUE LOVE for each other. . .*does Lurlene McDaniel have an EMAIL address?!*"
5,You'll CRY for hours,"I've read many of Lurlene McDaniels books,and out of all of them this one is the best..If you like her books becuase they are romantic and sad,you'll absolutly LOVE this book.It's is such a good book because it reaches inside you, to your heart and really makes you feel for the people,and care for them...This book was so good I'd give it more then 5 stars...."
5,The best book in the world,I think that Don't Die my love is the best books for young adult teens because it shows that some time things to go wrong and there is nothing that you can do about it and the book is one that i have read at least three or four times! and i would recomned her books to anyone that can read i can't seem to put the books down there is only about 3-4 book of hers that i haven't read! READ THEM
5,No book can beat this one!,"Lurlene McDaniel is one of my all time favorite authors. I have read many of her books from the first word to the very last word, and Don't Die, My Love absolutely captured my heart and left my tears soaking the pages. I cried of joy, pain, and hope because that is what this book has given me. Don't Die, My Love brings you into a whole new world of literature and trust me, this book is one in a trillion."
5,Heart-Warming Love Story,"Julie and Luke are soulamtes, they were put on this earth to love one another. But when 17 year old Luke has the ""flu"" that he can't seem to shake off, Julie gets worried and sends her honey to the doctors. Things go downhill from that point on. But while Luke undergoes chemo, Julie stands by her sweethearts side, and is glad to say she loves Luke Mudlenhower. This brilliant novel shows how much one couple has to go through, and there fight to rid this evil war going on in Luke's body. Lurlene McDaniel has truely outdone herself. This novel will make you cry like a baby, but on the last page, you know that everything will work out. I advise you to buy this book, and this can't-put-it-down- eyes-glued-to-the-page book will show what love is all about."
5,This book is the best that Lurlene McDaniel has written!!!!!,"This was the first book that I've read by Lurlene McDaniel, and I have read several others since. This book was really sad and I cried throughout most of the book. It reminded me of how sad and tragic these illnesses are. I know. I have lost two very special friends to cancer and I miss them dearly. Lurlene McDaniel's books show a true portrayal of how these illnesses affect the patient's life as well as those who love them. Keep up the good work Lurlene McDaniel"
5,The BEST book ever!,"Wow! It's the best book I've ever read. I cried SOO much after I read this book! It is the perfect mix of romance, trama, and everything! It is very well written. My two closest friends and I have read it SOOO many times, even one guy in my class (the guys in my class don't read and when they do it would never be about anything like this) wanted to read it. I have not found another book better than it!"
5,The best of Lurlene McDaniel,Don't Die My Love is one of the first books I ever read by Lurlene McDaniel. And to this day it is still my favorite. I began reading her books when I was in Middle School and now I am 23 years old and still rereading her books. I am now collecting her series in order to keep them in my classroom when I become a Middle School Teacher. This book helps to teach about Leukemia and also about teenage love. Julie and Luke are very realistic characters. I also believe it's good for teens to be able to read stories that open their awareness. Many of McDaniel's books helped me become more aware of myself and how I treated others. I hope that she continues to extend these messages to young people through her writing. Don't Die My Love is a truly inspirational story.
5,great book,this book was one of the very best books i have read. i really injoyed it. it was like a rollercoaster. up and down up and down it never was borning. it keep me going. i could hardly put it down.
5,The Best Book Of All Time!,"Oh my God! My cousin told me to read this book, and I was like, what? I looked at the title, and thought it would be a waste of my time. It looked kinda corny. So not true. Once I started reading it, I fell in love. The book is so touching, you just want to read more and more of it. When I finished it, I went into my bathroom and sobbed for about a half hour. I recomend this book for any one, romantic or not. Read it, you'll love it!Also read- By Lurlene McDaniel: Til Death Do Us Part, Saving Jessica, and Please Don't DieFor die hard romantics- Anything by Julie Garwood or Judith McNaught (also known as Amanda Quick) Read these if you're a teenager, they're adult fiction."
5,Don't touch that remote! Read this book instead!,"This is the best book ever, it is my favorite of all Lurlene McDaniels' books. The end is a real tear jerker. Be ready to read a book that you will never forget, and make sure you have a box of tissues handy!"
5,Fantastic Read,When a friend first gave me this book I hesitated to read it but as soon as I began I couldn't put it down. I ended up finishing the book the same day and then went out and baught my own copy. Since then Iv'e read it about a million times and still cry at the end....:(
5,THE BEST!!!,"This was the best book have ever read!! I bought when i was in 6th grade, i started it and never got around to finish it. When I was 7th grade I decided to give it another try. I read it and couldn't stop reading!! I never imagined i would actually cry in a book!! But you feel like you actually KNOW these characters!! And let me tell you, Luke is the most PERFECT guy!! Anyway! I am now going into 9th grade and have read the book at least 3 times!! If you're ready for a good cry and the best romance novel ever, then you HAVE to read this book!!"
5,The Best Romantic Book Ever!,I loved this book. I thought that the way that Luke treated Julie was awesome. I cried the last 5 chapters when he was dying and when they went on their trip. I definitely recommend this book to teen readers if you like romantic novels.
5,It will take your heart and squeeze hard.,I never really read any tear-jerkers before. But I couldn't put this one down. It is very sad. But it is also so extrodinary on how love can keep a promise even beyond the barriers of life and death.This is a book to read!
5,My Favorite Book,"This is definately my favorite book ever! I knew from page one what the outcome would be, (I cheated and read the last 2 chapters before I started the book!), yet as I read it I wanted the ending to change. You get so involved in a book as great as this, that you feel like an unseen character instead of just a reader. I felt everything Julie felt, and cried uncontrollably. I must disagree with people who find it bland and boring. Yes, all of McDaniel's novels touch on death, but each are unique and interesting, but none compare to ""Don't Die, My Love"""
5,love goes on 4ever,"i have read this book sooo many times i know lines from it! and every time i read i still cry my eyes out. this book is so good that i brought it 2 disney world w/ me. & when everyone in my family was resting,planning what they were gonna do i was reading my book. can u belive it. i was crying in the happiest place on earth. i couldnt put the book down! the first thing i did when we got back into the hotel i got my book and read it. this is such a sweet/sad book. if u like romance, this is the book for you.every time i read this book i get chills wishing i had a guy like luke in my life. & feel sorry 4 luke when he gets ill & 4 juile when she loses the love of her life. so 2 every1..READ this book."
4,One of my favorites,I love this book. I rated it four stars but I would have made it 4 and a half. I didn't like the ending and how Luke dies. He should have just made it through the surgery but the ending is fine anyway. It is still one of my favorite.
5,beautiful,"I have read this book many times. Every single time, I cry for Julie because I know how much it hurts to loose your best friend. The first time that I read this book, it was three months after my best friend succumed to cancer, and I was lost in the memories of them. This book describes both Julie's pain and the hospital much as I remember feeling and the places that I waited for my friend. Even if I did not know the pain of loosing a friend at such a young age, I would have still cried with Julie. I still would have cried tears of pain with her at the death of her best friend and tears of joy when she discovered his posthumous gift. Definatly read this book, just make sure that you have tissues handy. Luke and Julie's story is one that must be told."
5,Tears have fallen from my eyes because of this book...,"This book was the best i have ever read. I cried my eyes out. I can picture myself in Julie's shoes... if i lost my love i would be devistated. Mrs. McDaniel's works are true art. They are so beautiful and full of such reality that it's uncanny! I love her so much. Her books opened a new world for me. If i was to be stuck on an island with only ONE book... i would deffinally choose this one. I have read it 4 times already, and i'm a proud owner of it. : )"
3,"This ""Lovey, Lovey stuff""...^_^","I actually decided to read the book because so many of my friends recommended it to me. They all told me that it was a GREAT book. It was okay, but not as good as I expected. Yes...it was a ""touching story"" and all, but too ordinary. It's something you've already seen much on soap operas and movies. But of course, this is just an opinion of a non-lover. If you're a girl and had already read it, you might have a totally different opinion from mine. ^.^"
2,THE EPITOMY OF REDUNDANTCY,"If this was the only love story written by this author that I had ever read, I would think it was great. However, upon reading at least three of these short novels (by the same author) I found that the style and even exact context were similar, if not identical. Always focused on death, dying, and sickness, these novels display human suffering and the supposed release of such by the miraculous occurance of a check from an anonymous person. Three times I disovered the same words within different novels. Clearly a strong lack of imagination and unnecessary redundance. Did the author actually get paid for this act of self-plagerism?"
5,nice quality,"I am happy with the quality of this belt. The leather is thick, the buckle is hardy and the grommets look very nice. The note and candy in my package were a nice, friendly touch."
2,Cheap belt,"I didn't expect much, but this belt lasted about a week of daily wear before the grommets started coming off. I don't think I'd buy this again."
5,incredible,"I read somewhere that Devin Townsend thought himself more a studio as opposed to live musician. That makes no difference whatsoever to this live album - the intensity is jaw dropping. SYL is not the kind of the music to have playing in the background while you do something else - it is so powerful and complex it demands your whole attention. I'll often find myself standing rooted to the spot for thirty minutes when I put on their music - this album is especially the case. I also think S.Y.L sounds a lot better here than on the original version. I agree though, would have liked to see Underneath the Waves on this. If you're already a fan of SYL as you probably are, you'll know how intense they are and are probably wondering if it really is worth getting this album - let me just say that I have listened to City over and over, and seen the band twice and this STILL surpassed my expectations."
5,great live album from a great band,SYL are really heavy and brutal on the albums but live is where they REALLY Shine(good song too)!...even though the list of songs aren't that many they still chose some of the best songs to put on an amazing live album!...sure it has some overdubs on it but that's ok!still a great live album from an amazing band(which i'll be seeing soon!!!) and the bonus studio tracks are classics as well!...especially centipede!..if you like that song you'll love the Alien album
3,OK not as good as alien,This CD is ok. You can tell the band has progressed since it was recorded. Non the less still S.Y.L
5,top line,"If there is one thing I won't skimp on in my camping equipment, it's the water filter. Dysentery, or worse, just doesn't sound all that appealing to me. It's small and much, much lighter than carrying 50,000 liters of water."
5,Kept Me Healthy in Nepal,"I used the Combi for three months in Nepal. The filter allowed me to avoid polluting that beautiful country with hundreds of empty mineral water bottles. Another excellent reason to schlep your own filter is that travelers who must buy their drinking water tend on average to drink much less than the body needs. With a Combi you will spend less, pollute less, and enjoy consistently clean, good-tasting water. I do suggest traveling with a few more activated carbon refills than you anticipate you'll need. The water quality in developing countries can be rather poor. Replacing the carbon often keeps the water tasting good and provides additional peace of mind. Be careful about taking the Combi to cold climates -- the wet ceramic element will crack if allowed to freeze."
5,Nice for the price,"The Katadyn Combi gives you the filter life of the Katadyn Pocket for a lot less money. True it isn't made of all metal, but it is sturdy. The bottle top adapter works well and it is easy to disassemble. Great product."
5,One of the best out there...,"I've had my Katadyn Combi since 2003. Chose it over the Pocket because of the ability to use Activated Carbon and I got a good deal... $120 including a spare filter and an extra set of gaskets. It can be screwed onto a Nalgene bottle or a regular bottle. The housing is actually quite sturdy but not as tough as the Pocket. It's seen a few backpacking trips in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, Inyo National Forest, Yosemite NP, San Jacinto, Ventana (Big Sur) and SE Asia. Pump rate is good at ~1L/min and the pump handle is big and comfortable. Filtered water tastes great. If you're concerned about viruses, add a chemical solution into the filtered water, wait 15 minutes and you're good to go.Since then I've bought the Ceradyn for home use and a Gravidyn as a gift. Besides being cost-effective, they've all hold up very well. Ceramic filters rock!!!"
5,Nothing Better,Best foundations sponges I have ever used! When I could find them in the stores I would buy out their stock because these particular sponges were very hard to find!
5,Just right,Works great for applying foundation or moisturizer. Better than any I've purchased in a cosmetics department of a local retail store.
4,Sheen Simply Shines,"When I first saw this movie as Child it left a big impression on me.I recently purchased the Direct Source VHS version and the story and acting still stand up pretty well. Still One of my all time favourites. Martin Sheen doing an early rehearsal for Apocalypse Now.The film which features Martin Sheen for the most part is the only actor onscreen. Most of the other characters are filmed at a distance or photographed from Sheen's perspective. An interesting tool in filmmaking.Sheen's performance has never been bettered and he's given some standout ones over the years.The VHS copy is a little washed out at times but overall it didn't spoil my enjoyment. I look forward in this Digital age to seeing a DVD copy with commentaries from Director/Actor.Anyone in the business, take note."
3,One Beautiful Love Song,"This song is one of the most beautiful love songs I have ever heard. As a strong beleiver in fate and destiny it reallys strikes a chord within my soul. In response to one of the other reviews this song does appear on LeAnn's album ""I Need You""; although it's a slightly different version it is still great."
4,A new chapter begins,"""Deep Space Nine"" was always my favorite Star Trek series and, although it's been more than ten years since this book was first published, I'm glad I finally got around to reading the relaunch. Since many of the most interesting original characters departed the station in the series finale, author S.D. Perry faced a major challenge in replacing them. She succeeded both at reintroducing the old cast and bringing in some new faces. It doesn't hurt that the crew of the Enterprise-E is on hand as well.As the first of two parts, this novel is all rising action with no payoff, but it seems to be setting the stage for some spectacular developments. I hope Perry is able to provide a climax that satisfies the expectations she has raised."
5,Excellent!!,"I haven't been this excited about Deep Space Nine in a long time. Reading this book makes me wish the series was still on the air to explore the post-Dominion War era. I particularly like CDR Vaughn and can't wait for his continued development. Although there is a lot of history behind the story, this is still a good start for new DS9 readers."
2,Not all that great,"This book is 100% build up and 0% resolution. They should have just put book 1 and 2 together as a hard cover because you cannot read one without the other. It's basically character developement and interaction. The plot slowly drags along. I'm glad to see that the DS9 series of books will build off each other essentially creating an ""8th Season"" of the show, but this ""episode"" doesn't really look that good. If you really like DS9 and feel that there are good and bad episodes but all of them are worth watching, you should probably read this. If you plan on reading Abyss: Section 31, you should also probably read this because they go in order. Look for my review on Book 2 once it arrives and I finish reading it."
3,"Not great, but not bad.","This is a quick read, and does the job of forwarding the ST timeline. It's not a bad book, it's just not among the best Trek."
4,Awesome !,"I'm not familiar with Karen's work since I've only read like a couple of them. But I really like how the main character find that there is other things in life than her violin and how she misinterprets everything in her life as a major disaster. It makes you think at the very end, if both Brie and Jorie found happiness or not at least the main character Brie (Sabrina) grew up and realizes that she needs to listen to the people around her and stop thinking too damn much ."
2,Misery doesn't love company,I worked my way through this book hoping the situations would finally resolve; at the end I just felt like it was all sexual situations and no romance.
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book. I found it difficult to follow because the transitions between present time and flash back was very weak and often times not even available. I also prefer to see strong women portrayed--the main character left me frustrated most of the time. I have all of the other Kallmaker books and this one ranks at the very bottom of the list.
3,What happened to Kallmaker?,"I usually love Kallmaker's books, but this one disappointed me. The main characters just aren't likeable. Bree is horribly immature. Her one love is her music and when that is gone, she is nothing. Jorie is too scared and confused to know what she wants. (Although I agree with another reviewer - I liked Diane and Pam.)Kallmaker spends too much of the book centering on the negative that even the reader becomes depressed.I will buy Kallmaker's next book. But if it is like ""Maybe Next Time,"" that will be the last book of hers that I buy."
2,Maybe Next Time,"I've been a HUGH fan of KK's since I picked up the first book, but this was 2 bits shy of terrible. The story on a whole was fairly good. WHAT I DISTASTED was the jumping around from the present to the past; from one point in time to another. I never knew where the story was in BREE's life. She needs to tell this story in a more patterned clear cut cohesive manner. God what a waste of my 10 bucks. I think this one sold on her reputation and if the next one is this bad, I will not buy another KK book."
3,And just like that,This story was okay. I'm sure it's me but the story line and all have the same shape and I'm finding myself a little bored.
4,really... 4.5 stars,"maybe next time is a great story with a lot of feeling, research and anguish. i don't know what was so hard for the other readers, i found it rather easy to follow the book. kallmaker has a great talent for bring a character to life. of all the thigs i've heard about artistic geniuses, they are only a genius in one area, while failing in others... which makes sabrina starling fit the bill quite nicely. i know i wanted to knock bree and jorie around for being so dense about each other, but i understood it...bree was too driven by her musical needs and jorie was too scared by it. this amount of angish reminds me of watermark. it's dark and depressing at points, but there's redemption and light at the end that gives hope... i loved all the details so rich in imagery when kallmaker describes sabrina's musical ability, obsession, and talent... makes me want to listen to classical music ^_^"
3,Maybe next time,"Well don't bother reading the back of the book for what this book is actually about. I gave this story 3 stars because the writing is what you expect from Karin Kallmaker, even if the story is not. If you're looking for the traditional romance then Maybe next time is probably not for you. Instead try one of KK's other novels.I actually found this book incredibly depressing in a lot of places."
3,Exasperating!,"I can sum this book up in one word ""Frustrating."" The story had so much potential, but it ended up being a major let down from what one expects from such a talented author such as Karin Kallmaker. A few times I had to stop and re-read the back of the book to make sure it wasn't Kallmakers alter ego Laura Adams. (I kept expecting a pirate to appear so it would start to make sense!)I only give it three stars because even though it was disappointing, it was still well written and some of the dialogue pertaining to the violin was really exceptional."
1,Not recomended,"I bought this for my daughter last years for christmas, horrible product... I dont think it even lasted 1 week before it was broke and not by her. the casing started falling apart, so I just glued it back together and about 1 more week later it would no longer connect to the eye. And became trash!!!"
3,Crystal Brandy glasses,"Crystal Brandy glasses (4) there were a bit smaller than what I had expected. But they will suffice.Barbara Gamache, Fl."
4,Da Jesus Book,"Da Jesus Book: great reference, We lived there for 3 years, great to get back to the local feeling again"
5,fuuuuny,"if you've been to Hawaii and have any exposure to pidgin, you'll love thisif you've been to Hawaii and have any exposure to pidgin, you'll love this"
5,Get Da Jesus Book,This book helps you understand Christ and Christianity from a different and more basic point of view. The language is totally different from English (American) and it gives a translation that gets more to the point.
5,Da Best Buy,"I bought this Bible because I teach Sunday school to 6th graders. This is so much fun! We have a memory verse each week and they can read it out of the Da Jesus Book. If you want to get kids excited about what God's word says, then get this one! My purchase got to me quicker than promised and in great condition."
5,The Bible in Pigeon English,"This book is well written, and true to the Bible's word. It cracks me up, just because I'm from Hawaii, and it's written as the locals actually talk. It actually was easier for me to understand than the King James Version. I love it. I would recommend this to anyone who's a local in Hawaii. Otherwise, the words used would be hard to understand if you're not used to talking in this manner. Very good book. It is only the new testament, not the old testament, so don't expect the whole Bible in this book."
5,A totally new way to read the Gospel!,"I do not profess to know Pidgin but reading the New Testament in this translation puts a whole new view of the Good News. It is not easy to read this, but the intentional slowing down allows one to reflect on what is going on here."
5,A must have!,"I love this book! It has a really good history section and very nice photos, even one of a fennec fox, a theorized relative of the chi.The only section that is missing from this book is a chapter on breeding, but for the pet owner this book has it all. There is even a section at back to put a photo of you dog and record other important info.The health section is reasonably through, and even shows photos a many common problems along with what to do to treat them. Has a good chart on diseases and what causes them, however does not mention some other problems like hypoglycemia, hrdrocephalus, collapsing trachea, patellar luxation, pyometra and cryptorchidism. However this info is in lots of other chi books and info can readily be found online. A must have for ever chi owner in my opinion!"
5,CHI-WOW-WOW,"I believe this book is a must for any Chihuahua owner or anyone thinking about getting a Chihuahua. The breed can be fickle and is not the easiest to care for with its potential genetic problems the breed faces. -Luxating patellas, gingivitis, and temperament issues just to name a few.This was the first Chihuahua book I bought to research the breed before buying one. I know a lot about dogs in general, having worked at a veterinary hospital for many years. Even so, this book was able to teach me a lot that I didn't already know. With that being said, I was pleasantly surprised.It has a section devoted to puppies, general care, health issues, and much more.I also love the hardcover, full color pages, as well as up-to-date information. You will not be disappointed when purchasing this book!"
1,Ignorance! No Grapes! No Raisins!,"I thought by now everyone knows grapes and raisins can be deadly to dogs. I'm also giving this book a one, and the author should be held responsible for giving such bad, incorrect information. This one BIG error renders this book no good!"
3,Date night,Date night I think it was a chick flick where you can injoy yourself and special evening . Tina Frey is a funny lady in the movie
1,Movie,"Hated the movie. It was tasteless. The humor was rediculous - falling into the same category as what the society deems ""normal."""
2,My misake,The lenses were smoke im a surgeon so... Does not work for me cause i need to use in the operating room
5,"Odd, But cool","Hmm...Is it metal? Is it Medieval? I dunno, But It's quite good (To me anyway). Having had it up to my eyelids with Pop-stars and Rap/Metal I found this bag-pipe laden Lowenbrau-drinking music palate-cleansing. I do not, however, recommend listening to this album while chemically afflicted because the carpet turns into a giant two-headed wolf and tries to eat you. Anyway, It's better than the second album, entertaining, and certainly not something that the radio will overplay until you hate a perfectly good song (ie: Du Hast)."
3,Difficult To Review,"One of the finest metal e-zines gave this album all of 0 out of 10 points accusing this group of being clowns who play anything but metal. It may be a first for me, but I heartily disagree with them for once. This album is difficult to review because In Extremo has tried to generate a new musical style with their music. They play medieval minstrel melodies with a definite metallic edge. Not the modern, crunchy, speed metal style of metal. There are distorted guitars accompanying the music, and the vocal delivery definitely reminds one of metal. My opinion is that it succeeds overall, but I have an impression that it is a bit of a gimmick. On the other hand, I hope that the band fleshes out its style to make something that is In Extremo and not ""just"" medieval tunes with a distorted guitar, drums and metal vocals."
2,Disappointing-at best,"Katherine Roberts seems like a nice, well-intentioned lady, genuinely interested in helping golfers. Her PAR, BIRDIE, and EAGLE level Yoga for Golfers tapes and DVDs are minimalist at best. There really is very little there. I would highly recommend Yoga for Inflexible People or Vinyasa Flow Yoga. These programs are filled with VASTLY more help,information, and instruction at less cost. Or, if you are really serious about helping yourself, look up a local Yoga instructor and have them guide you for a few dollars more."
5,This song has got all the Groove you want,"In my mind the best clubbing song to hit the Clubs, ATB have done it again with another amazing song.Listen to it and I'm sure you will agree"
2,Ok.. but certainly not great,"For such an inexpensive game.. what was I expecting?Some games are ok.. but overall, it's a little lame. But hey, for the price, I'd have to say you're getting what you pay for."
