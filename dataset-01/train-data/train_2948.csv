5,"Famous Ballet Music - Gaite Parisienne, The Sleeping Beauty, Coppelia, etc.","Well orchestrated and played music from these famous ballets, many of which I've heard before, but didn't know the names. Beautiful music that stirs and inspires."
4,Very Good,"The author has turned her personal experience of being robbed into a plot for character Faith Fairchild (amateur sleuth and professional chef, caterer).This book is more of what I expect of K.H.P. than her last book. After the death of a close friend in a robbery and her own robbery, Faith takes it upon herself to find her cherished belongings as well as the culprits. Not as easy as it sounds due to the nature of antiques and collectibles.Of course Faith is still trying to juggle motherhood, catering, friends and being a wife as well as her detective work. All in all a very good mystery."
3,Pretty good story marred by a contrived ending,"Until the end, this was an entertaining book -combining suburban break-ins, the antique business and the death of a good friend. KHP's descriptions of New England life are right on target, and Faith Fairchild is the kind of amateur sleuth who can use the little coincidences of life to find a killer.Two things bothered me: the revelation of the 'master criminal' and the capture was just hollow, but more distressing was the fact that Faith really didn't get motivated to work on the burglaries until she was a victim- after her friend died. She seems to spend more time agonizing over the inordinate amount of silver and jewelry stolen from her than grieving for her friend."
2,Who took the silver?,"THE BODY IN THE BOOKCASE by Katherine Hall Page had a lot of pluses going for it, but never made it to the end.The final pages read like ""I've got to end this somehow, but how?"" Too stiff and clumsy when considered against others in the series.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
1,"Depressing--none of the ""cozy"" charm I value","I have enjoyed the Faith Fairchild/Pix Miller series, which made this book a great disapointment. I only read about of half, before I gave it up.I think, prehaps, making Faith a victim was too close to home. It is natural that she wanted her things back, but the book focused on her distress to the detriment of the more attractive, cozy atmosphere I found so pleasant in the rest of the series."
3,Just okay,"There is nothing terribly special about these folders, but for the price I guess I expected them to be stronger. I also expected vibrant colors as seen in the picture. Instead, they are the same drab colors as most folders of this type and flimsy cardstock paper. I do like the thicker cardboard insert to make them stay flat on the bottom, thus the three stars. I think that is a wonderful idea, just expected a more quality product."
3,meant to store more,These hanging folders offer an accordian pleated bottom with a cardboard reinforcer for that bottom. They do not address the problem I have noticed with such folders at work: that heavily loaded folders tear away from the metal hanger strips. Therefore I found them rather disappointing.
4,An improvement,"The cardboard insert that gives these files a broad, flat bottom is what makes them better. We use hanging folders for most of our files, including several years worth of bills, medical records, auto, financial, receipts and more. A single file can get overstuffed very quickly. The cardboard bottom gives an overstuffed file more stability. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the metal hangers are thinner than those on the Globe-Weis folders I've been using, but as long as they don't bend or break, they should be fine."
3,"Fairly low rent, ploddingly effective","I'm not sure what I expected here, but what I got was fairly low-rent but ploddingly effective: a sheet of cardboard strips with perforation is included. You rip one off the sheet, flip out small tabs at the end of each strip, insert the tabs into two small holes at the base of the folder and, viola, there's your Extra Capacity Hanging Folders with Box Bottom (some assembly required; services sold separately)."
4,It does the job...,"First off, I'm not going to complain that these folders don't have tabs. I use a label maker for my personal files anyway. What I look for in folders is stability, size, and function. These folders meet all three of my needs. The most important probably for you is stability. Let me assure you that these folders are a solid set. I had the generic brand from Staples last go around, and for some odd reason the glue that held the filing cabinet rack guides for most of the folders came undone and forcing me to either staple them or toss them."
3,Very specific uses.,"These hanging folders are sturdy and well made and they will work well if you need them to hold things such as books or bound items. They do not work well at all for papers or loose things. I tried to just not use the expander part in the bottom for some items, but then of course the folder is too tall for the file box. I did manage to tape some of the bottoms together to make regular folders out of them, and that seems to be working fine. They're good folders, but they are for a very specific need, so be sure to read the description carefully and know what you're buying."
3,OK but be prepared to assemble,"These hanging folders come in three colors, which is better than one, but if you want to color code files it would be nice to have four or five colors. The files come with a cardboard insert that stiffens the bottom of the folder so that it will not fold when you have several files in the folder. You need to take time to install the insert. It would be more convenient for the folder to be assembled when you buy it. The folder comes with transparent file labels, which are easily inserted. The gauge of the folders is adequate, but I would prefer a thicker gauge. All in all, an acceptable product."
4,SMEAD does it again,"I've had different brands of folders, some bought by myself, some from my employer, so far these seems to be the highest quality, however they come at a premium cost, and if you're not going to use the expansion, it might be an issue to fit them in regular size drawers.The folders are produced from high quality paper (or carton depending on your definition), with nice bright colors, and a smooth solid feeling. They're durable so far, and the expansion allows filling lots of items in a single file. However, as I mentioned above, if the expansion will not be used, it increases the height by an inch, and if your cabinet is the exact size, they will not fit - unless you fold them inside.I'd recommend these folders, if you're in need of durable, wide storage of papers. Otherwise, if you need cheaper, or smaller folders, I'd recommend buying another product."
4,THE THRASHING SLIPPERY FISH STORY,"This book is a very entertaining read about murder and mayhem delivered in the fantastic style typical of good Irish writers. Each chapter written by another author, one never knows how many twists it will take...the story line rather like a thrashing slippery fish..you just never know where its going to end up! If you've got a good sense of humour this one will bring more than a smirk!"
2,Just OK,The book got off to a great start and was pretty good up to about half way through. Then it took a nose dive. I was so disappointed with the ending. What happened ????.
2,Don't let the picture fool you!,"I just received this necklace. While the shipping and handling was remarkably quick, the product was more than disappointing. The picture makes it look so vibrant, but it must have had a heavy backlight. The necklace itself is DULL, DULL, DULL. There was also a foreign hair caught in the clasp and a strong, unpleasant odor attached to the whole thing. Also, make sure to check the return policy. With shipping and handling, the necklace is $15, but if I return it I will only receive $10 -$2 restocking fee - my own shipping costs=maybe $6. Make sure to note ""Amber colored."" There is no way it is real amber. I gave the necklace two stars only for my own stupidity in not noticing these things ahead of time."
2,BEWARE!! Some may not receive this actual game!,"Let me tell you how shocked I was when I installed this game and it looked NOTHING like what was pictured on the packaging. The ACTUAL game that I received from Amazon looked like something from the early Eighties!! There were none of the ponies my girls expected... No Sunny Daze, no Pinkie Pie, No Skywishes and no Sparkleworks... This one has Ivy, Morning Glory, Sun Sparkle!?!?!?What is even More weird is that even the CD ITSELF has the new ponies pictured on it. It lookes identical to the picture listed on the box here on this website. I don't know what they sent me but it is a very Outdated my little pony game... I am Blown Away! The only reason I didn't give this games less stars is that the daughter I actually bought it for doesn't understand that its the wrong game... and she loves to play it anyway."
4,Insight into the Early Schwarzkopf,"Although most Schwarzkopf fans will have a lot of the lieder in this set, very few will have the opera selections, most of which are sung in English (Magic Flute, Traviata). The interview is also very interesting."
3,Saturday afternoon fare,"Not really disappointed with this DVD was after the Stoney Burke episode, but, boy was the rest old? Never heard of Dickie Jones, Keith Larsen, John Bromfield had to really search my memory to remember Clayton Moore Buddy Edsen etc. Quality of the DVD is not too good, boy can't get over some of the so called Classics. Still I can't complain was after the Stoney Burke. Will the Stoney Burke series ever be released on DVD?"
3,I've got no time to view item,"Due to busy engagements, I haven't had the time yet to view mypurchase. I hope that during the long cold winternights I findthe time to do so.Max Wolper"
3,A bit of a disapointment,"First of all forgive my English, it is not my native tongue. Having read A Glastonburry Romance first and being overall pleased with it I was looking forward to reading this one. Overall it misses the mark in generally the same manner as Glastonburry does, the start of the book throws you in a new scenery, convincing enough and quite evocative and you get the feeling of truly being displaced and part of a new life (at least if you don't live around there)but the problem is that you are introduced to a large number of characters and story lines but none of them end up leading anywhere (a bit too much like normal life...). I mean what is the point of stepping into the minds and psychological processes of a dozen characters if nothing ends up happenning ? You keep reading quotes about Powys being the Dostoievsky of English literature but I plainly don't see it... I suggest you get any book from Dostoieivsky before this one (which is what I did)...."
4,another talented mc of the future,yall slept on this and his second one but when restless with dre comes out you will realize he is the best west rapper after lunch hung and rass kass
4,Xzibit keeps it true,"If you like underground rap, you must like Xzibit, its as simple as that... his singles were out way before this album came out,(3 card molly was in Beat Junkies volume 2) and I was very impressed by this album when I first heard it... What U see is what U get is one of the best song that depicts a street life and there are many other meaningful songs that differentiate Xzibit from any other fake Radio MC's... get this album, you won't be disappointed"
3,What U See Is What U Get,"Xzibit in my opinion is the illest MC from the West Coast. If you truly into lyrics and a true hip-hop head than this CD is for you. What You See is What You Get is the bomb. Xzibit keeps it real thru the whole album. On ""Focus"" X to the Z displays his lyrical skills and diversity. This album is tight lyrically but the tracks wasnt bangin, the production could've been better. Its a good CD but not as good as his first one ""To The Speed of Life."" - that one was bomb - a hip-hop classic in my estimation."
5,This is a Dope CD,"Xzibit shows his lyrical skill in this phat album. It is an improvment from ""At The Speed of Life"". ""What U See Is What U Get"" is the rawest song on the whole album. All the songs on this album are great. My Favorite songs are ""Shroomz"", ""3 Card Molly"", ""Los Angelos Times"", ""Handle Your Business"" and ""Nobody Sound Like Me"". In Conclusion, this is a must have for Hip Hop fanactics like myself."
5,Awesome,"It was amazing and sweet. I loved the story line. It had me laughing, crying, and smiling while I read it."
5,compelling and raunchy,This is a hot read about men who need to do a job and need to get laid. It's got similar action and tension to Yellow and is as sexy as Kizuna.
4,a bunch of indie bands paying a nice tribute to the 'mats,ok - I'll admit to being a huge mats fan... and that's exactly who this album is targeted for. The indie bands on this album - while they may not be the most recognizable faces in the world - do a great job of paying homage to the songs while still putting their own unique sound & energy into them.and what's scary is that I find myself preferring some versions of the songs from this CD over the 'mats originals! Valentine & Kiss Me On The Bus come to mind immediately... heresy!so suffice it to say - I think all huge mats fans should get this CD. it's a worthwhile tribute... and a rockin' good time.
2,Nothing beats the original,A fair sampling of indie-bands doing The Replacements. It's hard to tell the differance between the bands because they all sound similar. Just made me want to listen to The Replacements versions. The two female groups were the highlights.
5,An excellent reference book,What a great purchase. This is a detailed reference book for anyone wishing to better understand the anatomy and function of their horse.
3,Cher is almost at home on this hard rock lp,"I really love a couple cuts here, as they are good for the genre of power pop rock. ""Julie ""is a real ""bad girl"" cut, and ""You Know it"", with Les Dudek is a winner, but all in all Cher is more appreciated in ballads. Even ""Young and Pretty"", is not up to the best of Cher. It's worth a listen, but thank god Cher is not Joan Jett."
2,What should have been a 4 track EP with better production,"These songs (the rest are throw-away, especially 88 Degrees): Take It From the Boys: 2 stars. You know it: 3 stars. Young and Pretty: 2 1/2 stars. Fast Company: 3 stars."
3,Room for improvement,"Pros:It's the complete poems of Blaise CendrarsIt includes the original FrenchIt has an introduction and translator's notes on the textsCons:The French and English texts are in separate portions of the book, rather than on opposing pagesThe French texts are presented in a smaller font and without any of the illustrations that accompany the EnglishThe background notes on each section/poem are all at the end of the book, rather than placed at the beginning of each section/poem to which they referThere are no indications in the texts that a given poem or term has associated notesThe poems are presented in uniform size and typeface, without any attempt to reproduce the originals' extra-textual featuresI, subjectively, prefer other translations to Padgett's."
3,Couldnt be described as used but like new,"Found this watch on Amazon and took a chance. It retails in a brick and mortar store for about $1700. Amazon has it for approximately $1400. I bought it for $950. At the time of purchase it was described as like new but used.I would not have described it as ""like new"" I found a small scratch on the band latch and there were several deep scratches on the band itself where someone had tried to remove some of the links without using proper tools. It was still good value for the money but was not really as described.Always wanted a Tag"
1,Save your money.,"Daniel Quinn is lucky to have Ted Turner as his patron. This book is a waste of time, money and paper (all of which Quinn should be sensitive to). Spiritually it is empty. Metaphysically it is absurd, and comically it is not funny. I had hoped for much more."
1,A waste of good reading time.,"Don't bother with this book by Quinn,it is nothing like previous works. I found it a total waste of my time."
1,Hey up there! Louder! (And funnier...),"Ahh, well. Judging by the other reviews, this is a ""cult classic"" by one of those guys who figures out how to write cult classics and then makes a career of it. As a professional outsider I hadn't a snowball's chance in...the afterlife.The book is plainly intended to be funny, and I had the intuition that the authors were lampooning something--but I still have no clue exactly what they're poking fun of. The Tibetan Book of the Dead? H. L. Gold's American Book of the Dead (or whatever it's called)? Both are on my list but I want to learn Gaelic and German first, and that may take awhile.Without any grasp of the context within which this work exists, I can only call it shallow, mean-spirited, and worst of all, boring. Self-indulgence at its worst. Save your money--or learn a foreign language instead."
2,Author's Light Dims,"Quinn's most disappointing novel. While it is written in an entertaining style, reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's, it offers few of the profound insights of ISHMAEL and its sequel. I searched for some light, and occasionally found glimmers. Darkness and cynicism are not this author's strong suit."
1,this one should have stayed unpublished,"this book is a complete waste of time the only enjoyable part is the introduction, the rest seems like some inside joke between I don't know who. This book is not worth any money or time"
1,Read book description above. It's the best of the book,"Reading the back cover of the book, text that is given in the editorial reviews section above, you are reading the most clever, the funniest part of the book. The next best is the Introduction - coincidences, human interaction, human fraility. No need to read beyond that. The book is clever, making marvelous connections to real historical people. Unfortunately, the cleverness is useless when the clever premise and/or connection degrades into drivel ... often close but never successful, funny or perceptive. There's too much good and excellent literature to waste your time on this. Even if you wish to mindlessly kill time, you can easily find better mindless reading."
1,Not worth the money. Choose from ANY other replacement.,This cord is only 6 feet long. This is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter than the standard cord provided with HP laptops (about 9 feet). It borders on being unusable. The description and the fact that it's manufactured by HP suggest it's just like any other cord...it is NOT. Do not buy this product.
4,Past life sage,"Mind Probe-Hypnosis was recommended by a master hypnotist I recently met. He is a student of Dr. Hickman's and relays the most fascinating story of their meeting. This book is one of the more interesting books out there on past life regression, and the possibilities of past life regression. The cases that Irene Hickman presents show how, in many cases, the effects of past lives affect what we are doing now and how we are doing it. She presents a balance case for believing in the authenticity of past lives, but strongly urges further scientific research to validate it. She discusses past lives in the context of principles that are taken for granted in the eastern traditions, but frowned upon here in the west. Read with an open mind, this book is mind altering and enlightening."
4,Good Workout But...,"I own the 1st TBL DVD and Love it. I was expecting the same with this one. Well, this one is a bit different. They added the other trainer in and for me.... her voice is a little annoying. She does not keep her count as well and seems to mess up a bit. However, she does work you! I enjoy doing the Functional Flexibilty, Boot Camp, & The Men's Cardio Max. The Men's Cardio (I am a woman) made me feel as though my legs were going to explode and they felt great afterwards. I felt as though I had the beautiful runners legs that I have always wanted. ;)~ I definitely recommend owning a Workout Ball. They use it several times in the video. They also use a medicine ball but my ball works just as well since it has sand inside so that it does not roll. Hand weights are important too. You set the workout for as long as you need by choosing the workouts from a menu with it keeping track of the time for you. I recommend this video. U can't go wrong for only $10."
3,Not enough Bob!,"It's a decent workout, but not enough Bob! Too many props needed too, but I just improvised on that one. I liked 1 better because I find Bob really motivating and upbeat as a personal trainer.You do get a good work out, but it just doesn't seem as fun as the first one."
3,Ok,"If you loved the biggest loser 1 workout, then I believe that you are going to be disappointed. This workout has a lot of new things in it, but most of the workouts you can not do in your house unless you have a vaulted ceiling. It has some balance ball workouts that you need to raise the ball over your head. My ceiling was not high enough. So I missed out on a few workouts. And unless you are doing the more intense workouts, you do not get to work out with Bob, who I believe is the more inspirational trainer than Kim."
4,no cardio,The cardio in this tape is lacking. The toning and strengh training is great but it is too chopped up and you never get a chance to get your heart rate up. The first video was much better!
4,Good workout,"I rated this 4 stars instead of 5, because while it is a good workout and has some good segments, I truly think I like the first one better. This splits the girls and the guys, except for the stretching etc and I like the way they combined guys and girls in the first one better. Still, very motivating and challenging."
2,Not a safe workout for the knees,Lunges and squats are the two exercises that destroy the knees. The Biggest Loser workouts are full of both. I recommend that you avoid at all costs...your knees will thank you.
1,For Beginners,Good thing I borrowed this from a friend. This is not for intermediate or advanced fitness levels. I found the work outs slow and barely broke a sweat.The music is also bland. I would recommend this for a warm up.
4,biggest lose 2,"I like the DVD, but it only works in one of my DVD players, and of course it's not the one in the exercise room. I have to use it on my computer.It is a good work out."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to see BL was coming out with a new DVD. I lost all my baby weight with number one. I LOVED Bob and the workouts were great. I was bummed with this DVD. Kim annoys me and she is EVERYWHERE. I thought the ""girl"" workout that she did was too tough. I had to keep stopping and I'm in decent shape. I was able to do all the workouts on the first one with no problem. The segments were a bit strange. I was happy to have a shorter cool down as I couldn't be bothered with the LOOONNGG one from the first DVD, but it doesn't have relaxing music like the first, and again it is KIM. I was bummed the entire workout and I'm not looking forward to doing it tomorrow. I think I'll go back to the first. I really disliked this DVD. :("
2,Disappointed,"I purchased Vol. 2 with great anticipation because Vol. 1 was fantastic. Well, there was not much to be excited about. To my disappointment the workouts were not as fun to do. I did like that Vol. 2 had workouts that were only 10 minutes for the days that you didn't have much time, and they are hard workouts! But none the less, Vol. 2 was a disappointment I'm afraid to say."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!,"This is a great workout dvd. I love the fact you can personalize your workout!!!! All the moves are clearly and easily explained. Don't be fooled it feels great and seems soooooooo easy, but go slow, because you will feel it the next day. I've been walking for over two years and wanted to add some variety. This is just perfect!!!!!!!I am telling everyone at Weight Watchers about it."
3,Good workouts but requires a lot of equipement compared to first one,"These workouts are good, but I prefer volume one hands down. The low-impact options are minimal in this version and the one low-impact version requires equipment not commonly on hand and not advised on the jacket. I have hand weights at home so that piece was not a problem, but I don't have an exercise ball (the large one or the small ""medicine ball"" type) and really don't have room for those. If I had known those were required, I would have skipped this DVD in favor of another."
5,Love This!,I'm a huge fan of this show and watch it all the time! I was so excited to know that we could order this DVD and workout like they do! It's a very instructional DVD and you can customize it any way you would like to. It even has a workout type for women & men! It's a great addition to my other workouts!! Plus I love seeing the people from the show doing the workouts!
4,It is a good workout,"I am a fan of BL having lost 50lbs on my own before BL was out there. I got this as a Christmas gift after having my first child and it kicked my butt. One of my complaints is there is too much talk. I guess I prefer instruction without the chit chat about how I'm feeling it burn.. I prefer the segments with Bob in them over Kim partly because Bob seems a bit more down to earth, though Kim's segments are tough. My other problem is that there seems to be a lot squats & lunges in the different segments so there isn't much variety as I had hoped and the arms & abs only have the Bootcamp 15 minute workout (Granted I prefer toninng my abs, butt, & arms). I haven't tried the men sections but after reading a couple of posts I will. Overall it is a good workout!"
3,okay...but not as good as Vol 1,"I am a huge fan of the show and I was excited to receive Vol 2 but it left me a little disappointed.PROS: 1)It offers the ability to customize your workout, you can do a little or a lot. 2) Old favorites Suzy & Matt make appearances 3) The workouts offer variety by using weights and exercise balls 4) Regular people (not Barbie dolls) doing the exercises right along with meCONS: 1) Unlike Vol 1, they do not offer 1-click preset workouts (b/c of all the options - I keep forgetting which workouts I like and find myself starting and stopping) 2) There seems to be a lot of hidden commercials (At the end of a workout Bob talks about Jennie-O turkey) 3) the cool-down in Vol 1 is beautiful and tranquil - the cool-down in VOl 2 is low-budget and rushed 4) My biggest complaint is Kim - I personally don't enjoy working out w/ herI will continue to use this dvd for variety along with Vol 1 and maybe keep a cheat sheet with it to help remember the workouts I like."
4,Great for getting a workout,"I bought both 1 and 2 and just happened to get the second DVD first. I do like the fact that you can vary your routines through the menu selections. You do get a workout! Whew! I'm torn as to whether I like video or not though. I like seeing REAL people, but I 'm personally having trouble with the fact that they all weigh the same as I do now. I know I'm not fit like they are. But it makes me wonder (and question) whether or not I can ever attain a goal 120 with a starting weight of 170. If they are still in the 150 range, will I ever get past 150 on my own? I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to lose weight. I did feel great after doing it once and I expect that I still will. I know some people said that it's distracting sometimes when the background people are out of step, but that's mild. You can't expect to stay in step every time. I just wish that they had women who were in the 120-140 range so I had something to look forward to."
2,Good,"I like the video, but not as good as the biggest loser 1. The video is broken down differently had hard to set up a total workout, also the woman instructor in the video is half dressed and I have a hard time looking at that while I'm working out. I try to set up the workout with Bob Harper leading them even thou they are designed for the men. Like it ok, but would chose the first one over this one."
4,Not bad for the money,"The workout video (to tell the truth) isn't my favorite of all of the Biggest Loser workout videos, but it still does get you sweating. I wish the workouts were a little more intense and thought it was odd that they broke the workouts out by ""men"" and ""women"". None of the other Biggest Loser DVD's I own do this, so thought it was weird and even a little discriminating."
4,Barbie On Steroids Trainer Not Necessary,"This is a great workout that complements Biggest Loser 1 very well, adding variety to cardio, toning and sculpting. Very challenging, and I see and feel my body changing. Unfortunately, Bob Harper is not the only trainer in this one. An additional trainer, not part of Biggest Loser, is added. My wife and I call her ""Barbie on Steroids."" This takes away from the ""real people doing real workouts"" feel, and her too perfect body is distracting. If you are choosing between Biggest Loser 1 or 2, choose 1."
2,Incomplete,"Good book, but my order was incomplete. According to the product description, there was supposed to be a student study guide included. The main text was the only thing included in my order. I would have given a 5 star review, but that's hard to do when you get jipped out of half of the product. Things like this keep me from wanting to order online. I use to shop with Amazon pretty regularly, but problems such as this seem to happen more often than they use to. There is a lot to be said for the personal service you get at a brick and mortar store, that's all I'm saying. If you don't need the study guide (I do, I'm enrolled in an aviation technology program), and you don't mind buying from a misleading seller, go for it. I, however, intend to take my future business elsewhere."
3,Interesting Record of His Personal Observations,"Granted, this is not McMurtry's best work, but if I were sitting beside him, and we were chatting ""in a stream of consciousness"" way, I would find his thoughts interesting enough, sharing as one tourist to another, in an unhurried, leisurely exchange of views. This is a period in his life when McMurtry was having to face ""loss"" and the reader needs to include this understanding in his analysis of the book. I feel I learned more about McMurtry as a person, from having read Paradise.Evelyn Horan - authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book OneJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book Two"
3,A trail of books,"The book tries to place a finger on what love (or search for paradise or an undefined ache) means. The author/narrator is visiting Marquesa (Paradise on earth, as felt by a variety of authors over the last 2 centuries) while his mother is in death bed. Mother dies one day after the author returns. A quick read, but not necessarily thought provoking. It almost felt like the author could not penetrate into his own ego-chill (to consider one's own non-existence - Erik Erikson reference in the book). The book is filled with references to books which provide a background to the author's thoughts, which is very useful."
3,A good academic resource on science fiction cinema,This is a very good anthology of articles about science fiction movies and television. Most interesting is are the ones about space travel and Spiegel's article about the Fantastic Sitcom.
4,The value is in the packaging,"It's a nice and handy book. However, most of the salient points in this book, which is about the sloppy and rather misleading math behind the Bush Tax cut has already been made in his New York Times Op-Ed articles (which could be read for almost free.I like this book, and as with all Krugman's books, it's highly readable and enjoyable. His arguments are convincing and clear. But, I've read them before. So I'm giving it less stars. The fact that it comes in a handy book form that can be read and marked easily, does create real value, though."
1,AdvanceClocl #2060 Alarm clock,"Ordered two of these alarm clocks, One was inoperable out of the box. The second is still working after one month. The quality is not what I had expected. Apparently no QA at the factory. No way for refund from Amazon or the supplier. Probably won't purchase from them again."
1,Noisy & Cheap,I plan to donate this piece of crap to Goodwill. It is very difficult to wind. The second hand is ridiculously (comically) loud. It is also unattractive. I absolutely HATE it and wouldn't recommend it.
2,For Collectors Only,"This album was recorded at a time when her record company wanted her to record more pop sounding sounds. The result is an album that doesn't represent the typical Loretta Lynn sound or material. There aren't any forgotten Loretta Lynn hits to be found on this album, and with so many wonderful Loretta Lynn albums yet to be released, I wonder why this album was selected. Vocals and production are first rate, the material is not. This makes a good addition to round out a Loretta Lynn album collection, however, for the casual Loretta Lynn purchaser the better albums are: Coal Miner's Daughter and Loretta Lynn Sings the Hits of Patsy Cline. Perhaps another reviewer will have a more positive response to this album."
3,Your Attitude is Showing,"I liked this book not only because of my teacher who taught the course it was used for, but because it really helped me deal with some things at work. Even though it looked as if it got wet when I got it.....it in pretty good condition otherwise."
5,german perfection,"I am using mostly Rotring pens.This fountain pen comes with F nib and a ink converter.Ink flow not always perfect as Waterman, first I install a Waterman ink cartidge it was moderate.But when I filled the converter with Namiki ink Pen completely went into a new level.Perfect match with Namiki ink, nib is almost like a M and excellent ink flow.Build quality on this pen is perfect, when you handle you fell the weight,it is quite heavy and useful for everyday carry.I totally recommend this pen, for 20$ it is definetly a steal"
5,shows a lot o what it takes-,"Not only does Aaron have a clear idea of what he wants with this dream and how he should relate to his audience and stay right side up through all this... but...Every Parent of performer kids should read this.She shows a healthy attitude in supporting and encouraging and advising her son, and we also get to see how true she loves and adores him, and how she wants everything right for him now and later.Angling Aaron to the real and ready in performing- but also in his bigger life.Aaron's girls will get a lot on how he thinks on performing and people and family and stuff in his life, but mom really shows how to help rather than over-handle her performer kid.Looks like he's in good hands and she's lovin every minute."

2,Well-researched but tedious,"This book might be a useful resource to scholars researching the history of the CIA's Science and Technology Directorate. For the general reader, however, it is a tedious story of bureaucratic infighting that quickly becomes a chore to read."
3,Dry text with a few gems of info,"Richelson has written a very complete, documented, book on the Directorate of Science and Technology. However, unless you are looking for how government organizations function, or don't function, there isn't much new information on the technological accomplisments of the CIA that hasn't been written about elsewhere. I found the detailed reporting on who hated who, and how the defense department fought with the CIA for control of programs only slightly interesting. The technological achievements of the CIA were really interesting but sometimes amounted to a half page of good stuff, then back to the petty infighting within the government. I don't recommend this book unless you are doing a research paper."
4,Interesting Background and History,"Readers seeking information on any aspect of the CIA must bear in mind that the available information is very limited. So many aspects of what goes on simply cannot be revealed. Keeping that in mind, ""Wizards of Langley"" offers an interesting history of the Agency and background for the DS&T. It does not go so much into details of the Directorate's everyday work as it goes into the history and politics. It does not come to life like a story of individual people, but is interesting nevertheless."
1,The Fascintating Turned Dull,"I agree with the other reviewer that this is an incredibly boring book. It should be a crime to take so many fascinating projects, problems, and people and turn them into endless, dry, droning lists. There IS no narrative to the book. It reads like a Google search on technology...without any of the interest added by being able to check out the links. I bought the book because I heard the author in an interview, and he was very interesting. Too bad none of that comes through in the book."
5,Interpretation at its best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dr. Richelson, who is a senior fellow at the National Security Archives, gives a highly recommendable interpretation of the Directorate of Science and Technology, at the CIA. His book is based mostly on declassified documents, making its stories highly believable and interesting."
2,"The poetry I can deal with, but the political commentary I can do without","The poetry I can deal with, but the political commentary I can do without. I happen to agree with most of his political observations regarding war, but IMHO every venue does not need to be a forum.The last chapter on interpreting another poets work was less than helpful to me, personally."
5,Maturity,"This is a great book by Robert Bly. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in living a more mature, peaceful, and accepting life."
2,Odd Vehicle for Political Bias,"R. Bly probably has something interesting to say regarding the duality of the collective unconscious, but as I became more offended by his repeated, incongruent insertion of his radical political views into the text, my interest in deciphering this obstruse thesis dwindled. If you believe as Bly does, that the tens of millions of traditional, conservative Americans living in certain areas of the country are intrinsically evil, maybe you can choke down the pious little pamphlet."
3,"Beautiful, but unclear","This is a great performance by the Tristano band. Good selection of tunes, unfortunately the recording is poor quality and when the group breaks into their familiar unison runs the mix gets really muddy. This is a good record for someone who can't get enough of the Tristano school, but if you aren't familiar don't start here, Tristano is nearly inaudible under all the other instruments, in particular the guitar."
3,adam and i,"sure ""from mighty oaks"" is overblown and sappysure it is lame lame lameit does not measure up to many standards of what good music must givebut ""adam and i"" gives honestygives a song of a father's love deep and puredeep and puresacred"
1,Buyer Beware of Pirates,"Someone in Russia has decided to copy both of Ray Thomas' fine solo albums. He then sells them on to other knowing or unknowing people to flog on Amazon, ebay or anywhere. These cds are NOT factory sealed originals. The originals have never been re-released since the original pressings. Nor has Mr Thomas authorized copying these albums in any form. These cds are illegal and a breach of copyright laws. The Thomas cds are just the tip of the iceberg, these people have done this to hundreds of artists. No royalities are paid to any of these artists. Help end pirating, boycott these sellers!"
2,it's ok,"The binder is ok. Not worth the price though. It's nice the binder flips over to the back. But w/in 1wk, I noticed the RINGS do not stay properly closed - so papers can easily fall out when I flip through pages. Rings are not strong."
5,Best binder for taking notes,"I just purchased this binder to replace my 5 Star Flex Notebinder (which was a useless, poorly made product). So far I love this binder! I am using it to primarily take notes and it works great because of its hinged ring apparatus. The rings are not attached to one particular side of the binder which allows the rings to flip back and forth while note taking. Which means you can fold the front cover around and behind the back cover and have to binder lay flat on a desk while taking notes (something that you really can't do with most binders). This was completely worth every penny I paid for it."
3,"Decent, but doesn't last long and not that different from normal binders",Taking notes is not as easy as it looks in the picture. It's only convenient on one side. Binder starts breaking apart after a month of usage.
2,Love the idea but...,these do not hold up well. After just a few days of light use they are cracking at the seams. Too bad because it's such a great design.
1,Box of Sun,"I am extremely disappointed! The image shown for the item was the Rainbow Box which includes the Box of Sun.For $175.00 I expected to receive the Rainbow Box! When I called the store I received no response to my question.I am still waiting for an answer. $175. is a lot of money for one smnall book, however long out of print and originally sold as part of an ensemble.Please explain!Doris Shawdorishaw@optonline.net"
5,Love to see my home town Tucson in this picture.,"Wonderful Movie, Just seeing my home town Tucson, Az in the back ground was really nice. I knew all the mountains and where they were, and Audie's acting was good, he played this role great. I wish that this movie was on DVD. Some of the places that they filmed was out were I live. Just a great movie. please see it if you can."
4,Get the facts and be able to laugh at those that don't,"For many the wearing of the kilt is full of surprises and confusing issues. This book plainly gives insight as to the appropriate use of the kilt. There is also information on accessories that one may or may not decide to use.Things you may find in this book include.The difference between a lady's and a man's kilt (Very important).Why weapons and finery may not be appropriate.Alternative ways to keep from buying expensive accessories (Some make your own diagrams).And great insight as to the differing opinion of the puristsand the more commonly acceptable way to do things.Whether a long time wearer or a newbie. A must read tokeep from being embarrassed.For all those also that really want to know ""What does a Scotsman wear under there?"" The author has given some very appropriate ways to respond if you are so asked."
5,A must have,Mr. Thompson knows his stuff when it comes to kilts and other Highlandwear. More info than most Americans would even need....
4,A wonderful resource for anyone who dons the kilt.,"This book is a wonderful & humerous resource. I generally suggest it for the first-time kilt wearer, but it may also be read with pleasure by the person who has worn the kilt for many years. You'll enjoy reading it, and will learn from it!"
4,Informative little primer on kilt wearing.,"Informative little primer on kilt wearing. Written by a Scotsman, it's a great resource written in a concise fashion about the wearing of the Scottish kilt. I would say, however, that if you wish to wear the kilt in America, some of the formality shared in the book really seems a bit heady. I enjoyed this as a good read and now will use it as I upgrade from a ""casual"" hiking kilt to a more formal ""Prince Charlie"" kilt."
2,Skip it,"The real title should be ""Computational Conformal Mapping in 1975."" It's far from the state of the art, leaves out major topics and contributions, and has barely any reproducible computation in it. At best an introduction to classical, little-used methods."
5,GREAT INSIGHT INTO ELTON'S WORLD,"He is a true one of a kind. You get to see him at his ""DIVA"" best. It's funny and also sad. His life seems to be one of the boy who never really grew up emotionally.One example of this...jumping on a plane alone while on vaction without explantion only to return a few days later with the excuse;""A woman looked at him sideways"" while taking a tennis leson. Just when you are laughing and having a good time it's over."
3,Inside the Life of A Superstar,"Tantrums and Tiaras gives us a look inside the personal life of Elton John during 1995's Made In England Tour. Shot on video by his partner of then two years David Furnish the viewer gets a warts and all look at John's daily life on the road.Beginning with the video shoot for the single,Believe, and covering the European album promotion tour the film moves into the stars interaction with family and friends. There is a touching scene with his grandmother that is not to be missed and a hilarious rant about flower arranging. The film then covers the Academy Awards and ends with concert footage of the American and South American legs of the tour.This is one of the most honest portrayals of a star that I have seen. The commentary recorded 13 years later is just as informative as the film and offers a good retrospective on the couples busy schedeule and their relationship. Extras include some deleted scenes.See it if you are a fan."
2,I adore Elton!,"But this DVD is a little boring. It was done by his husband, David and is amatuer quality and just not that good. I did like the segments with his Mother, though."
4,The Second Ever Rumble,"PPV Name-WWF Royal Rumble 2Date-1/15/89Buyrate- 1.5Attendance-19,000City --Houston, TexasArena - The SummitThe Hart Foundation/Jim Duggan over Rougeans/Dino BravoRockin' Robin over Judy MartinHaku over Harly RaceBig John Studd won the Royal Rumble"
1,High ratings for this? Are you folks for R-E-A-L?,"Fortunately, it has been a long time since I read anything this sappy, sophomoric and/or senseless. Frankly, I'm amazed this series was published. Adriana Trigiani is a harlequin romance writer at best (i.e. fabio visits the farm), and it's unlikely she'll ever produce literature of quality. I left this book in a Portland coffee shop (on purpose), and it was still there when I returned two weeks later! Go figure, eh?!"
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring",I don't know how any reader could give this book a five star rating. I was hoping it would get better as I kept reading but it didn't. It is so predictable and the characters aren't drawn out at all. The key parts in the book are thrown out at you with no preparation at all. ( )
1,ZERO STARS IF I'M ALLOWED,"I don't even know which adjectives to use to describe this book. I found it so BORING. It is predictable, sophomoric, juvenile -- I don't know how anyone could rate this as high as some of the reviews I've read. While Ave Marie is charming at times, the book reads like a bad Fannie Flagg novel. I know one other reviewer said not to waste your money on this one -- I agree."
3,Wellllll.....,"Ok, I've gotta say, I'm a little disapointed...almost more in myself then this book. After reading all the wonderful reviews this book received, I was extremely excited to read this series, so I bought all 3 books and got to work. Well, I was not overly impressed.I took me a week to finish this book, I just couldn't get into it, no matter how much I forced myself to sit and read it. It moved verrry slow, and the characters were just so-so. I kinda never really got to like Ave Maria, she irritated me, and Jack Mac didn't have much of a personality at all, but there were some other characters that I thought were ok...Pearl, Iva Lou, and the Italian family. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, just not great.Trust me...I'm really bummed about not loving this book. I'll still read the other 2 seeing as how I've already bought them...hopefully the story will pick up a little though."
4,ENJOYABLE READ!!!,"This is not a macho man's book.This is not a true """"chick"""" book.This book is about """"people"""".People, in general. You get to meetthem and get to know something about them.Very interesting read--I enjoyed it!!!"
4,light hearted story about a woman's search for happiness,"A nice, light hearted story about a woman's search for happiness. I really identified with the area Trigiani wrote about because I grew up only a hop, skip, and jump away (about an hour or so from Big Stone Gap). She had the language of the area and a lot of the characterizations spot on. Even though the story is fictional, it felt right. I know Powell Valley High School and areas such as Coeburn and Norton. I know the coal mines seeing as my dad worked in one for 25 years before Black Lung set in and eventually killed him. Heck, my sister and her family actually still live back in one of the ""hollers"". Anyway, it was a nice little story that brought back memories of the area I grew up. I will continue the series."
3,Big Stone Gap,"I enjoyed this book, unfortunately I read the sequel ""Home To Big Stone Gap""first. I liked that book more. Thought I was missing something in the series."
3,"Cute and Cozy, not Compelling","This was the sweetest love story! But it was slow (took me several months to finish) and not much of a page-turner, despite the super-endearing characters and awesome setting. I'd still recommend it as a beach read."
4,A pleasant surprise...,"I was given this book by a friend who knew of a family connection I have to the Gap. I wasn't expecting much, but needed a break of the boatload of mindbinding nonfiction I was working through. Last weekend (during the summer), I picked it up and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. After a few pages, I didn't want to put it down and, though I pretty much knew what was coming, I really enjoyed the read. I'm looking forward to Trigiani's sequel and now plan to explore Amazon for similar works of fiction."
3,"Charming, but predictable","Ave Maria Mulligan and her band of mountain friends are a very likeable and amusing group to kick back and spend summer down time with. Ave Maria's life at the opening of the book is really jam-packed with wholesome activities! As the story develops, however, we understand why she feels the need to fill every waking minute.If I hadn't read it at a time when I was on vacation, though, I might have thought I had wasted my time due to the predictable, fairtale nature of the story. And Theodore's sexual nobility is really hard to believe!"
1,PASS ON THIS ONE,"I really get angry with myself when I read a book in its entirety and find no enjoyment in it whatsoever. This was the case with this book. I should have put it down after 50 pages but I kept on plugging on. The town does seem charming and the scenery beautiful but could the characters be any more boring. I like a main character to jump out at me....Ave Marie couldn't do that if she tried. This is a character who can't seem to make up her mind about anything. The highlight of the book for me was the bookmobile scenes. Other than that, there's nothing else to it. I hate to be so negative about a book but this one didn't do it for me."
2,Peculiar,"And sadly, not in the good way. There are times when reading this novel was like eating rice pudding mixed with ground glass - tasty at times and terrifying at others because you don't know what you're about to swallow."
2,Nope,"I found the writing juvenile, the dialogue irritating and boring. The premise was great, just, for me, didn't deliver."
3,An okay read,"I am still reading Big Stone Gap and it's a fast little read. However, I think Ms. Trigiani should've researched her Tennessee cities a little better because the NBC affiliate station WCYB is NOT located in Kingsport, TN. It is located in Bristol, TN/VA, though Johnny Wood IS in fact the weatherman at WCYB and STILL is! WKPT is the ABC affiliate in Kingsport. This may be trivial, but for me living in the area, it felt like a slight.The characters of Big Stone Gap are likeable although I would like to tell Ave Maria to quit whining so much. I did like how she handled her Aunt Alice, though she should've told her where to stick it.All in all this is a good weekend read or vacation book."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I found the characters to be shallow. I did not care what happened to them. There are way too many inaccurate discriptions of where things are located. An example, is that the last time I looked, Roaring Branch is located between Big Stone and Appalachia. At least that is where it was located two years ago when I was there. That was where it was when I was a child and went there with my grandfather to seine for minnows. I loved her Aunt. She is a true hillbilly type character."
1,Disappointing : (,"Sadly, I was disappointed with Big Stone Gap. While I loved the setting and small town feel, I greatly disliked Ave Maria Mulligan. Instead of a successful, independent, businesswoman, I found her to be a selfish, whining, self-absorbed woman who was dependent on not only the men in her life but her friends and employees as well. All her relationships, from Theodore and Jack, to Iva Lou and Pearl, seemed one sided. What did they have to offer her. She often wasn't there for them because she was busy wallowing in her own self-pity. Her distaste for Fred Mulligan was the nail in the coffin for me. Very disappointing and I wouldn't have finished this book if I hadn't been reading it for my book club. Hopefully, we won't have to read the sequal, I don't think I could take any more of Miss Mulligan/Mrs. MacChesney!"
3,"Feel Good, Small Town Romance","A moving story set in a small town in Virginia. The main character is a single, sucessful town pharmacist. She is considered an outcast of sorts since she does not fit the town mold. She learns more about her past, her family, and her own self worth through the novel. In the end she finally confronts her ability to love. The characters in the book are very likable and real. The only complaint I had was the love story seemed a bit unrealistic, but I will read the sequel and see how it all turns out!"
1,BEWARE WHEN MOVIE STARS TOUT A BOOK,"I should have know better when I saw that Hollywood people were touting this book.....they should stick to acting because obviously they don't know good literature. This book reads like something Nora Roberts would have written while in high school. The characters are under-developed, unmotivated and plain out boring. The highlight is supposedly a visit by Liz Taylor to the town of Big Stone Gap. Even this part was boring. My advice -- read something by Lavyrle Spencer, Nora Roberts, Fannie Flagg or Billie Letts. Don't waste your time on this one...I'm sorry I did."
2,Like Listening to Someone Rambling On and On,"The main character is telling the story and she rambles on and on, jumping from topic to topic. You start getting interested in a particular situation and almost mid-sentence, she switches thoughts and starts telling about another character. It seemed as if the author had a bunch of thoughts scrambled in her brain and she put the words to paper without unscrambling."
2,Big Stone Gap,"I understand this is part of a series, which I obviously will not read. It is the first - and only - book by Adriana Trigiani that I did not find interesting or enjoyable to read."
2,This Gap is pap,"I am bewildered by all these gushing reviews; I didn't think there was anything special about Big Stone Gap (except maybe the hype it generated). This is straight out of the touchy-feely- quirky small town-love comes a knockin' when you least expect it-Oprah genre. Apparently, these are themes that resound with lots and lots of people. And I'll admit it--I did read the book in its entirety, so it must be somewhat compelling (either that or I'm a masochist, because I did go on to read the sequel, which I REALLY would not recommend). Anyway, if you've read any of Oprah's other small southern town selections, there's no real reason to bother with this one."
2,An interesting world but...,"Big Stone Gap provides an interesting view of life in a place with which most people would be unfamiliar. If you're from the mountains or have a great curiosity about life there, then this book is recommended. Otherwise, it's not. Many of the characters are cliched (examples: the chainsmoking, gruff employee with a heart 'o gold; the good-time girl that all the men adore, also with a heart of gold of course). The writing is often unbelievable. A favorite place of town residents isn't just good, it's ""magical."" The heroine tends to make speeches on the spur of the moment that sound like what she'd say if she had several hours to write a speech."
1,No Literary Masterpiece Here,"While the scenery sounds beautiful and some of the characters are charming, I found this book to be very dull. So many parts were very predictable while others were nonsensical. Perhaps this is the author's chance to go back to her childhood and relive the wonderful times in Big Stone Gap; I guess you had to be there because I just couldn't get attached to this book."
1,THE SAME OLD THING......,"I saw this book reviewed in People Magazine and thought it sounded good and might be worth reading. I know many other reviewers gave this book high ratings but I found it so boring and unoriginal. The main character, Ave Marie, seems shallow and undecided about everything. The surprises in the book were poorly handled. I kept waiting and wanting for this book to get better but it never did. I don't know what the hoopla is all about regarding this book but I agree with the reviewer who said, Don't Waste Your Money on This One."
4,Wonderfully Charming,"Adriana Trigiani's ""Big Stone Gap"" is a wonderful tale of Ave Maria Mulligan and her small town ways. This 35 year old, unmarried woman in rural Big Stone Gap, Virginia tells an enchanting story with so many humorous characters. I loved the small-town aspect of the story and the unique way that the author tied everything together. The revelation that she isn't who she always thought, starts this tale of self-discovery and wonderful adventure. I was thrilled by this book and didn't want it to end. I loved Ave Maria's character and found her to be very believable and easy to identify with. A great book about a real person. It's a well told story. I think you'll enjoy it."
4,First of a trilogy,"Ave Maria Mulligan leads a carefully ordered life in the little town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia. Surrounded by the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Ave Maria seems oblivious as she performs her duties as pharmacist, member of the Rescue Squad, and director of the local historical pageant. Her beloved mother has just died and has left her a letter telling her some family secrets which shake up her well-ordered world. Without her mother to ground her, she begins looking for new meaning in her life and decides that she needs to travel to Italy to meet the relatives she's never known. There are two men who are interested in her, but she decides that she needs to keep one as a best friend and ignore the attentions of the other one. This is the story of a woman who comes of age at thirty-five and who finds what she has really been searching for all of her life. The small-town characters are reminiscent of Fannie Flagg's characters and are delightful. This is recommended reading!"
2,BIG STONE GAP HAS SOME GAPS,"At best, this book could be compared to a substandard Lavyrle Spencer offering. The story is weak and the character development is non-existent. While the description of the town is delightful and the visit by Liz Taylor quite humorous, the rest of the story is lacking. Anyone who is giving this book 5 stars must be a friend of the author or has lived in this area and enjoys reminiscing. I originally purchased this book because I heard Carolyn Rhea, of Sabrina fame, tauting it on the Regis and Kathie Lee show as one of the ""best books she has ever read."" I waited until the last page for it to become one of the best books I ever read. IT NEVER DID. I guess I wasn't surprised to read in the ""Acknowledgements"" at the end of the book that the author thanked Carolyn Rhea -- obviously they are friends. Need I say more....."
2,Big Stone Gap,"A good and easy read, but lacking substance. I guess I'm just not a ""happy"" ending, everything tied up tightly, type of person. All in all, I expected more."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE,"The previous reviews on this book are either very high or very low. I might be in the minority here but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked. It is a story that has been told dozens of times before except that the setting is different here -- Big Stone Gap. There were a few parts I did find enjoyable but for the most part, I couldn't wait to be done with it. The main character, Ave Maria, seemed so one dimensional to me. Nothing she did was a surprise. The rest of the book was mundane and trite. The trip by Liz Taylor and her husband was supposed to be the highlight of the book; perhaps in the author's eyes -- not for this reader. My opinion is don't waste your money on this one."
2,Entertainment industry hype?,"I suspect this book has such great blurbs (Whoopi Goldberg, Rosanne Cash, etc) because this woman made so many contacts when she worked in Hollywood. It's the only thing that would explain why this mediocre book has such a buzz right now. I finished it and it was ok in a Hallmark Hall of Fame kind of way. But it is certainly not a great romance novel or anything. Read a good Nora Roberts instead."
5,A terrific read,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I opened up ""Big Stone Gap,"" but at the end of it I was completely hooked by what Trigiani has done with the characters in Big Stone Gap, Va. She has written a lively, hugely enjoyable novel that's full of humor and heart."
3,A modern Fairytale,"Ok... I guess I have to explain the three star rating....Let me start by saying I liked the book... I liked the main character Ave Maria, her independence and her relationships with almost everyone in her town. I also enyojed the description of what life is like in a very small and tight community, where everyone knows everything or mostly everything about everyone else. I live in a very large city, so it was a nice change.I think the problem for me started when the book, which seemed like a very realistic and believable story at first, turned into a complete fairytale with Prince Charming and Fairy God Mother included... Its not that I don't like fairytales, I just wasn't expecting this book to turn into one.Also, I found the characters to be extremelly stereotyped, although most of them were nice.Still, I loved the fact that in the end the book is a happy, lift your spirits book, and it is definetly an easy read."
3,a fun read,"I read this book because my college-aged son met & interviewed the author. My son read the book & thought I might like it. How nice that a son can pick out a book for his mom!I suggested this book for my book club, and now that it's my turn to ""review"" the book & the author, I find that I can't remember much about the book. That doesn't speak well for the book.In other words, this book is a ""fun read"". It didn't change my life. And yet, I did identify with some of the characters. It's ""cute, fun""."
2,Big Stone Gap,"Didn't work for me.the main character is Frustrating , and the story is pretty unrealistic. I found myself saying 'really?'"
5,She doesn't dissapoint,"I have always enjoyed her style of writing, she's very descriptive and being a New Yorker myself, she has a way of taking me to familiar places and pulling you into her family and their traditions."
3,BIG STONE GAP.,Big Stone Gap.. i am enjoying it and i find its easy reading after a busy day. I would not hasitate to recommend to my friends.
3,Polaris Booster Pump Seal Kit,"I ordered this seal kit for a Polaris Pump which I thought would be the replacement part. When I went to replace the seals they were the wrong size seal kit. The info on line for this kit wasn't real plain, but the service was great."
4,backup plan,"the pool pump shaft seals i purchased were very inexpensive. good idea to keep 1-2 in your stores because when needed and purchased at the pool store they cost much more. then you have to travel slowing the progress of the job. good idea to keep extra gaskets o-rings, etc. as well."
2,Good Pics,"This is a decent book for prices and examples but didn't give much description on identifying. For instance it explains the different metals used to make the jewelry, but not how to identify which metal you have in your piece. Good for pics but not too good for identifying/dating pieces."
4,Outstanding,"A Sensational book on the topic of ""unsigned"" that is way over do. With hundreds of pieces featured and color pictures. I love the way the author formatted the book by categories ... makes looking up pieces easier. A very welcomed addition to my personal library books on Costume Jewelry!"
2,"A lot of pictures, no real information","This book contains a lot of pictures but no real information. I was hoping that it would help to provide identification unmarked costume jewelry pieces or at the least provide more information. All this book does is present pictures and contains no real information that would aid in identification or even help to pinpoint era. Sadly, I can not recommend."
1,Unsigned Beauties of Costume Jewelry: Identification and Values,Very helpful in identifying and valuation my vintage jewelry. Recomend to any vintage jewel collector.
1,Unsigned Beauties of Costume Jewelry,"An excelent reference book, however, sellers/buyers need to know a particular designer to find items. Not all items are referenced. Sellers/buyers need to do MUCH more research if they are looking for something special."
1,Title is misleading,"I purchased this book as many people probably did because it says identification and values on the cover. It does not help the collector identify pieces, it just describes in general the pictures shown, ie: Large brooch with blue rhinestones, blue strawberries with special caps of gold on long gold stems, etc. It does not help people to identify the age and maker( or possible maker) of the jewelry shown.It does not show the backs of the pieces which is so important in identifying jewelry. I have many books on jewelry as I have been collecting and learning about vintage jewelry for over 20 years, this book was useless for me."
5,I still don't understand why Candlemass never became HUGE!!,"This is av very good compilation of the BEST scandinavian metal band EVER. If you like really heavy melodic metal that steams of agony this is the band for you. They invented doom metal in the 80's and still I havent heard anyone making darker music (including loads of modern posers who just found out that Depeche Mode are really good ( they always listened to them but hid the records from their friends)).You can trace influences from the likes of Black Sabbath and Mercyful Fate but Candlemass certainly got an own unice sound. The soaring cryinng from the operatic Messiah Marcolin are amazing. A real metalconossier shouln't be allowed to make the sign of the evil eye if not familiar with true classics like Solitude, Mirror Mirror, At the Gallows end and Samarithan just to mention a few.But be warned. This is SLOW, DOOMY metal and it rocks like HELL (literally)."
5,still need a manual trash compactor,"I broke the one I had that Joy Mangano on QVC at the time had made. I fell and hit the back of my head on it. I have looked high and low for another one with no success. Joy, please take notice and give it back to us."
4,I was a teenage teenager,"I picked this up purely because of the title and it became an instant classic which I must have re-read at least ten times throughout my terrible teens. It was such strange, sad, quirky, funny and sometimes outright hilarious story, I still love it today.Essentially it is a novel about friendship and finding your identity in that strange nuclear winter between childhood and the adult world, with some madcap adventures involving such things as hearses and coffins and lunatic undertakers. What more could a fledgling goth have asked for?I went on to read some of Zindel's other writing such as the Pigman but they didn't have the same spark as The Undertaker's Gone Bananas. A must, if you like odd fiction with quirky characters."
4,One-of-a-kind!,"If only the rest of our lives were as eventful as this book! It's so funny,with an original plot. I like how Bobby and Lauri didn't care what others thought of them and had zany adventures. I was an outcast once,so I can identify with them. It shows that at times some popular people are vapid and have everything backwards;the outsiders are the ones who know what they're talking about. It took Lauri and Bobby to get onto Mr.Hulka's crime. Everyone else thought he was innocent and they were crazy. The game Bobby played with Lauri to allay her fear of death was humorous,although a bit morbid. The pranks they played were amusing. If you want to laugh and think,read this book."
3,OK,"the selection of movies is OK but there are too many grade B movies and documentaries in it, still worth the money"
3,Not What I Expected,"I usually give books a 50 page test. If I am bored after 50 pages, I put the book down and slowly back away. Sadly, this book was one of THOSE books. I just couldn't interest myself in the story. Now, I am one of those american's who devour just about anything british,(um... hence, the name...) but even that aspect of the book couldn't keep me reading. I was bored and couldn't have cared less about the characters. I hate to give a bad review, but if you are searching for something in the lighthearted, chick lit category, this is not what you are looking for."
2,Outdated and detached...,"I guess after reading The Nanny Diaries, which I liked, I expected this book to be similar. It wasn't. Melissa, an American, goes to England to work as an au pair for the Haig- Ereildoun family after loosing her job and calling off her wedding. The writing style is strange (it's not written in a diary format) and it seemed like it was happening many years ago...I actually couldn't tell the exact time period it was set in. There really is no plot, so it's hard to describe it much further. The only thing I did like was the whole culture shock Melissa went through. That's about it."
3,Middling -- 2 1/2 stars,"I had high hopes for this novel, but it failed to spark my interest. Originally published as Do Try to Speak as We Do, The Diary of an American Au Pair comes across as a guide to British terminology. Thus the former title is better suited for this novel. The novel is centered on the culture shock Melissa experiences when she moves from San Francisco to work as an au pair for an aristocratic family in Scotland. From then on, Melissa chronicles her misadventures with the Haig-Ereildouns family - most of which is centered on the cultural differences between Americans and the British. There are some amusing moments, but not enough to make it interesting. I recommend The Nanny Diaries instead."
5,What a Pleasant Surprise!,"I have only listened to two other BBC audio releases of the missing Doctor Who stories and have not been impressed with the way they have put them together, but I was surprised in listening to this one. The main problem is that these audios require more exposition from the narrator and often don't. This would be fatal to a story such as The Celestial Toymaker, with the multitude of visuals it featured, but the BBC smartly works out a very descriptive narrative read by Peter Purves that doesn't detract from the original content. One of the best I've heard and well worth a listen."
2,Confusing!,"Amazon, what are you doing to your Kindle readers? I just want the above book in Kindle version with all the drawings and index, however, it seems there are various versions without any clear indication which version has been edited by Robert Post with the drawings and index.Apparently we cannot expect Amazon to bring any clarity, so who can help me picking the right apple?"
2,No TOC or illustrations,"This seems to be a fascinating book written just after the famine. However, the previous review notwithstanding, the file I downloaded has no TOC or illustrations. Without these (especially the TOC!), I quickly gave up trying to read it."
5,Fabulous lucky find,"12 years ago I lived in a modest 4plex in a rather marginal part of Long Beach, and one day walked out my door to a street festival I'd not heard about (probably because of way too much overtime). Ruby Diver was playing, maybe 30' from my door. Normally I avoid such events as the quality of the performances is frequently low or the music is simply not to my tastes. But this time; Wow! I later found them playing at the Lava Lounge (a bowling alley that had lots of good shows...very appropriate for this band) and the audience clearly loved the show. This is still one of my favorite finds from ~15 years in LA. Fun, funky, catchy tunes...I wish there were more. I bought a spare copy ""just in case"" when I found out they broke up (the lead singer moved away). Love, love this cd. For all the bad theater in LA (and there's plenty) there's some great music on the streets(which is less well known, sadly)."
5,So glad I bought this!!,"I went back and forth when trying to decide whether this was a needed item or not, but I ended up giving in and buying it. And I'm so glad I did! It works great for cleaning fans and also for getting cobwebs! One of my fans was extremely dirty and it only dropped a couple little lint balls; most of them stuck to the fibers. I had also been looking for a cobweb duster for those pesky little cobwebs you see floating around every once in a while and this doubles great for that. Very useful and effective for cleaning."
4,Nice duster,"The duster works as advertised and cleaned the fan blades with one swipe. I have not used it extensively, so I don't know how well it holds up. I does do what it claims and doubles as a floor duster also."
5,Ceiling Fan Duster,"This ceiling fan duster is a Godsend for me. It grabs the blades of the ceiling fans. slides right over them, so they don't get away from you."
2,very narrow,I gave a 2 because it didn't work with my living room fan (it is not a huge one)it worked very well with my bedroom fans (minni ones)
5,Great Product!,"Works as advertized! Very light weight, easy to use, and does the job. It is much lighter weight than a broom, so it is also very handy for removing cobwebs from walls and ceilings.The directions suggest rubbing it with your hand before using it to create some static electricity, which in turn helps dust stick to it. We did that, and it really does the job. No dust falling on the floor or furniture; it all stuck to the duster.The duster is also very easy to clean - just wipe it off with your hand. And when it needs a good washing, either hand wash or toss it in the washing machine.It also arrived very quickly - sooner than other items in our order.Very happy with this purchase."
3,Average Ceiling Fan Duster,"This is not a telescopic wand on the duster. You can reach your fan blades from floor level but if you have vaulted ceilings and want to use this duster to clean corners, you will need a ladder."
4,Good product,Works well. Not the easiest to line up with the fan blade and I am a little concerned about how well it will work after washing removable duster head.
2,Not enough substance,"The ""feathers"" on this thing are too soft to really get the dust off well, but it's better than climbing on a ladder with a dust cloth."
4,Finally,"It was pretty gross to see how much dust and schmutz had accumulated, but overall the fan duster worked fine. A little tricky to feed onto the blades of my fan, but once I got the hang of it, worked like a charm. Don't forget to clean the mechanism ledges above, AND put something below to catch all the dust and grime builde-up!"
5,Works great,"I have a very tall ceiling in my den, so this has worked great for dusting without getting the ladder out."
1,Disappointing,"This product was a great idea. It does get the stuff off the ceiling fan. Unfortunately there's nothing to keep the stuff adhered to the duster so it flies all over the room before the fan is turned back on. Pledge, or something, would help but if I could reach the ceiling fan to put furniture cleaner on it, I could clean it and wouldn't need a Ceiling Fan Duster."
3,Just okay,"Not as much attraction as other duster wands I have had. The pole is sturdy and does a decent job on the walls. If you have a lot of dust on your fan, you will not get it all with just this."
4,Ceiling Fan Duster - Cuts Cleaning Time Drastically!,"This is a terrific cleaning tool! Ceiling fans are wonderful, but sure get dusty, so this is good for simple whisk of this tool and both sides clean. Only one draw back, dust tumbles down, if it's thick enough :) as mine was! Error on my part is it doesn't drop in washer for cleaning, my bad. So a shake or two out the door and tada, good as new. I would recommend to friends for this is a quicker-ceiling fan cleaner for me. Cleaning ceiling fans isn't a priority on my list, but this sure makes it fun! Amazon, thanks for price & quick delivery."
5,makes life easier,"This works great. It easily slips over the ceiling fan blades and picks up dust. For even better results, spray the duster with Pledge or something similar. It really works well then too. I even use it to quickly run over my window blinds."
1,Corporate G-R-E-E-D,"Dreadful. This project, obviously designed to milk the already-dry Cline vault, serves neither the great singer nor the guests (only Willie, who actually knew Patsy, sounds authentic). Fake arrangements, fake chemistry. Forego this ghoulish desecration and buy Cline's great originals."
2,"Patsy plays ""second fiddle""","I have to downgrade this CD to only two stars-- Patsy Cline is subordinated to both the background music and the other singers. Instead of singers with background music this CD has foreground music, with the singers in the background. The session ""sidemen"" overwhelm the singers' voices. In most of the tunes the modern singers also come on stronger than Patsy. Patsy is, for the most part, relegated to the role of ""second fiddle""-- her famous name is being used to make money, and to promote the careers of the modern artists."
1,Unnecessary Duets Album,"The goal of this project was to pair Patsy's timeless voice with current popular country/inspirational singers and produce something that was both classic and fresh at the same time. Unfortunately, the producers chose to re-record the music to these classic songs with Nashville session musicians and while it sounds pitch perfect, that is exactly the problem. The slick shimmering production comes across as really cheesy. Using synthesized strings takes away the authenticity that made the original sessions so memorable and takes away from the honesty and rawness that makes country music what it is. They'll never be able to recreate the magic of Patsy's original sessions, so why try? If you're curious as to what it might sound like to hear Bob Carlisle sing with Patsy Cline, first of all, why would you be? Second, you'd be better off imagining it in your own head. Stick to her original recordings. They sound just as good today as they did 40 some years ago."
2,Mind Numbingly Boring,"The subject matter of this book has the potential to be interesting. However, the author kills any interest you may have by repeating herself over and over. She spends about 2/3 of the book letting you know that she herself is a product of the white middle class. She also goes on and on about what she is going to examine in the book without ever actually getting around to examining it. Also, a considerable portion is devoted to the author's dilemma about whether or not she should have an abortion after unexpectedly becoming pregnant while having a casual relationship while writhing the book. This book reads like a general outline of the author's diary and it's BORING. She never truly examines the psyche of middle class suburban white girls in America - just her own meandering self observation. Skip the book.P.S. - It's interesting that the first reviewer of the book shares the same surname as the author."
5,This tour bus is not small......,"I saw this amazing tour bus at stores.It`s not small.It`s huge and realy cool.I dont think I will get it,but I think it`s totlly hot.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
1,Flashback Fever,"I do not have this toy, but was reading another review for this toy and it said this bus was the Bratz Flashback Fever Bus In a different color, That person was right. If you look at both pictures, you wil know that the buses are exactly the same except the color. how cheap."
1,Beware,Beware of Bratz toys!!! We have purchased 3 Bratz vehicals & they ALL fall apart!!!! Very expensive but made very CHEAP!!!Parents save the box so you can return it if your unhappyJO JO mom of 4 girls
1,"Silent Hill - Reproduction 11"" x 17"" Movie Poster","i wish i could give this no stars it was not a reproduction it was a complete fake the colors were washed out the image is slightly crooked and it has a white border all the way around it i have seen the official ones in this size class which were meant for comic book store displays where they had the newspaper and this is obviously false goods with the border it is actually smaller than 11""x17"" i can't begin to state how angry it made me when i opened it and saw that border let alone the fact that the colors are wrong i put it in an area not highly visible since i bought it and the returns policy makes it way to much work for what its worth one of the worst things about it is all my friends see it and can identify that it is a cheap nock off and i got ripped off which is embarassing because not only have i played the games we went on opening night to see the movie"
3,JUST ME,THE TITLE WAS GREAT I ENJOYED IT HAD NEVER HEARD THIS ARTIST BEFORE BUT ENJOYED HEM AND WOULD BUY OTHERS BY HEM
5,Children of the Lion books,Love the series. Plan to continue until I have the entire set. Have enjoyed reading the books very much. Thanks.
3,I don't know,"Great voice. Average songs. But, production? It becomes very obvious that the two producers have chosen to use this album to spotlight their musical abilities. There are styles of music (Metallica, for instance) when it is appropriate for the guitars to overshadow the vocals. But, not country. If you believe a country singer need country musicians to back her up, you won't find it here."
1,The sophomore curse claims another victim,"Danni's first album 29 Nights is one of my favorites and I was very anxious and excited when Whiskey/Prayer came out. However, I am very disappointed with this effort. A Shot of Whiskey and a Prayer pales in comparison with 29 nights. Nothing about this disc lives up to 29 Nights. The writing is average and Danni's voice sounds weak. None of the up tempo numbers match the energy of If the Jukebox Took Teardrops or Weren't You the One. None of the ballads match the poignancy of 29 Nights or Touch Me. In fact, I found Shiver of Lonesome and Can't Build a Better Love to be down right lethargic. Save your money on this one folks. If you want some more ""real"" country, get Heather Myles' Highways and Honky Tonks or Joni Harms' Cowgirl Dreams."
3,not half bad,"The first disc, especially the Hungarian Rhapsodies, is really wondeful and I suppose worth the price of the album. But the second is about as bad as the first is good. The choice of music is second-rate at best, and the piano on the Tchaikovsky sonata (which is a pretty dreadful piece anyway) sounds like Aunt Polly's out-of-tune parlor upright. I also wish that the people who designed these albums had come up with better packaging--it's very difficult to remove the discs without touching the recorded side."
5,Great Gift Idea!,"Super good idea for grandchildren or children, especially since it glows in the dark! And a great price with fast shipping!"
3,Dim,"Not as bright as we hoped. Cheaper than led. And be careful, distance is hard to judge in the dark. not easy to catch. Now I wish I had spent the money on the led."
5,Love the Football!,Got this as a Christmas gift for my grandson and he loves it! Was delivered early and product more than met my standards.
2,Sent Flat,This was sent flat and it looked used and I bought it new.It also did not have a box it was wrapped in plastic.
3,Ok,"The only problem I have with this item is that the finger grips started ripping off after the first 5 throws. My son loves the fact that it glows so instead of returning, I super-glued the grip down. So far so good."
1,"Bought New, Looks Used","I received a defective football but had to give it to an 8 yr old last night for Hanukkah so there was no time to return it. The ball was discolored, almost looked dirty. Some of the black print was wearing off in various spots and there was some plastic red stuff but the hole where you put air in the ball. I bought it new and it looks used. My nephew didn't care b/c he's 8 but I would have preferred to not give a gift that started out in that condition. I would have hoped whoever shipped this would have inspected the product first, especially since I see other reviews with the same issue."
3,this is a junior size?,"This ball is not the junior size I was looking for, too big for my 7 year old's hands. Nice football, nice grip, nice everything except the junior size is misleading I thought it would be smaller."
3,Returned this as it looked cheap.,"I cannot attest to the working quality of the ball, I returned it because it looked cheap and did not light up from the inside like I wanted."
4,Glow was Great,Very good purchase for a my grandson...glow was bright enough to play at night...would purchase again...My grandson really LOVED it
4,A good read but not very comprehensive,"The author is definately very qualified to write this book. He generally keeps the reader engrossed as he creates the backdrop and context for each of the fairs. Unfortunately, he doesnt go very in depth into any particular fair, and the reader is left craving more photos. The author frequently boasts about his extensive collection of memorabilia, but too little is shown. Its enjoyable for a quick read, but if you are interested in more in depth knowledge and imagery, you should investigate one of the more comprehensive books."
5,D.A. Carson's Matthew Commentary,"I have come to love reading D.A. Carson. His exegesis is thorough and his harmony of the gospels, defending God's Word from liberal textual critics is superb. His style of writing is scholarly yet readable. The format of the EBC leaves much of the sources in the comments, and apts for limited notes at the end of each section rather then footnotes, which hinders the fluidity of each comment. D.A. is in the process of updating this commentary, but if you're not willing to wait, buy it used for a reasonable price."
4,Great Barrette: wish color was less dark,"Love love love the barrettes by this company. This barrette was great, as well. Very very well made and high quality. My only negative about the barrette was: the color wound up being dark and darker than worked with my dark hair color. That probably is my mistake. In future, I would choose lighter colored barrettes from this company. I bought some lighter color barrettes from this company and they have been spectacular, especially the multi-colored one with Swarkovski crystals."
4,Outrageously Fantastic!,I LOVE THIS ALBUM! If you haven't heard it you must check it out. You'll like it more and more with each listen too. These guys are awesome!
1,Mounting Problems for EFS lens,"The Bower tele-converters work only on Canon's EF lenses. It will not work on the Canon EFS lenses. There's a difference in the way the EF and EFS lenses are made. The Canon camera body will accept both EF and EFS lenses, but Bower tele-converters only accept the EF lenses.Also, I am trying to get the Bower converter to work with a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 on my EOS Rebel XSi. But I'm having very limited success.The auto-focus will not work. The camera searches and searches, but to no avail. It must be manually focused. And that's a big pain because the ring you must hold in order to manually focus the lens is tiny and I end up touching the lens filter about half the time.If I could get my money back on the bower tele-converter, I would."
2,Piece of crap,"I usually don't like to write poor reviews. But this really requires it. I was OK with the idea that the focusing was poor in low light. However, I can never use autofocus with this extender. It simply won't work. And while I was expecting some degradation in quality of the image, practically all pictures using this are unusable. I would not recommend it."
3,Does it work with Canon Kit Lens 18-55mm(58mm)?,Does it work with Canon Kit Lens 18-55mm(58mm)?Does it work with Canon Kit Lens 18-55mm(58mm)?Does it work with Canon Kit Lens 18-55mm(58mm)?
4,Performs as expected,"First off let me say that South Bay Camera handled my order very well. I really chose a teleconverter based on price. With that in mind I am very satisfied with the product. I confirm what other reviewers mentioned that the AF ""hunts"" for a focus at higher magnifications so I had to use manual focus. Other than that, I had no other problems with it. FYI, I used the converter on my Canon 75-300mm f4-5.6 III and my kit lens (18-55mm). It worked on both."
3,Good image quality poor auto focus,I use this teleconverter with the Canon rebel XTI and the Canon EF 75-300 f4-5.6 III USM lens. The image quality is fine but the autofocus is poor. The lens (with the teleconverter) focuses very slowly at focal lengths under 270mm and at full 300mm it will not autofocus at all. Manual focus works just fine.
4,Decent fot the money,Does not give you the feel of 2 x zoom but it does help.If you are using an image stabilized lens you will lose the Auto Focus abilities of the IS lens
2,Some good with some bad,"I am please that the Bower 2X lens mounted to my EOS Rebel XT and performed well with my Canon EF 70-300mm zoom lens. But when my Canon EFS 18-55mm lens would not mount to the Bower 2X, I was very disappointed. The extra 1/8"" of rubber-like material on the inner Canon EFS 18-55 lens will not allow it to fully seat in the Bower mount."
5,Happy chopping,"I saw this knife on RR's program, ordered it and I love it. I have the 5 inch knife also but this one is my favorite. I own a very good set of Henckels knives that I've had for about 10 years (and still use), but the Furi is the one I now use the most. Does a great job of cutting up veggies, especially nice for chopping denser things like squash or potatoes. Nicely balanced."
5,my favorite knife,"as a cook at a well known nyc restaurant, i spend a minimum of 3 hours a day with a knife in my hand. over the years, i have used many brands and types of knives. I've owned german--wustof, messemiester and japanese--global and mac, but i find myself constanly reaching for this knife. it feels really comfortable in my hand. it's well balanced in is great for everything. if i could only own one knife, this would be it. I would also like to note that anyone with hand or wrist problems including arthritis should give this knife a try. i've had tendonitis from cooking and the ergonomic design of the hand has been a tremendous relief. at first it may feel a bit awkward, but it soon feels comfortable. i'm just a little embarrased now that it has the rachel ray print on the blade. that's not something you want seen in a professional kitchen."
4,Great knife/great price,"I'm becoming more and more of a 'foodie' as of late, and saw this knife advertised on the Food Network and then saw it in a chef's store here in Seattle, so I picked one up.Overall, a very easy knife to 'wield' and surprisingly lightweight, when compared to other santoku knives. The only thing I felt was kind of silly about it was the copper tip at the end of the handle.. I don't know anyone whose hands are sensitive enough to 'feel' when a knife has gotten off-balance, let alone anyone who would actually shave down the end of the handle to rebalance it.Nevertheless, I feel like I got my money's worth and have enjoyed using it as I build skill/confidence in choppin' like a pro."
2,Celebrity endorsed Chinese junk.,"Ok, I get it the perky girl from Macy's perfume counter uses these knives because she gets paid to. Who really is impressed with that, given her culinary qualifications?The handle of the Furi is pretty comfortable, the the balance is nothing like a Shun Santoku, nor is the blade quality impressive. It is a typical chinese produced knife; ie; soft steel and poorly ground, and who knows if the steel has been properly tempered...They get points for a good design idea, but the knife as a whole was a huge disapointment after all the hype about it.Rachel Ray should stick to selling perfume and makeup, leave the knives alone.Want a real knife? Pick up a Shun Santoku. Razor sharp (literally) and extremely hard, they have the best quality construction on the market. The classic and Elite lines are my personal choices in the kitchen.Skip the Furi."
1,The only star is for the balance....,"Well balanced knife, very comfortable to use. BUT, this knife will not hold an edge. After a preparing a couple fairly simple meals this knife couldn't cut hot butter. Very dissapointing. If you're going to spend this much on one knife, get a Henkels or Wusthof."
5,Furi Coppertail East/West Knife,"I don't know what I would do if I didn't have this knife. It has become my number one staple and essential tool of the kitchen. It is balanced very well and very comfortable to hold. I love using it for chopping herbs and garlic. Because it is wider than most chef's knives, it is very easy to scoop up chopped food. I feel like Rachel Ray when I use it! It's the best knife I have purchased."
2,Light Weight Cussler,I've been a Cussler fan for years and love the tongue in cheek macho style of the heroes and their JamesBond style female companions. But this effort disappoints. The plot is undeveloped and jumps to unexpected conclusions. The extreme violence meeted out to the badie at the end is uncharacteristic of Cussler and spoils the effect. Above all the Admiral's secretary gets shameful treatment. Sorry Clive you bombed ot on this one. EdwardBear
2,"Welcome to the cold, mean Pitt","There are several things missing from this book - Al Giordino, Rudi Gunn, a historical prologue, and a nice Dirk Pitt. Pitt stumbles all over Iceland in this ridiculous adventure, seeking some bad guys whose motives are to take over banana republics. Oh yeah - that's a compelling theme. I couldn't help but notice how much I disliked this version of Dirk Pitt. He's definitely not the heroic figure in the first half of the book that I enjoy in most of Cussler's adventures. At one point, a kindly old man helps Pitt, and I expected his name to be ... you know who ... but it wasn't. And the end is supposed to stun the reader, but it only nauseated me. This is definitely the worst of this otherwise, excellent series."
3,Do we really want to see the feminine side of Dirk Pitt?,"I am a big Clive Cussler fan. Iceberg, however, does not come close toCussler's best. Where were Al Giordino and Rudi Gunn? These two charactersreally add flavour to Cussler's stories, but they were never mentioned once in Iceberg. I envision Dirk Pitt as a ""James Bond"" type. His undercover disguise as a gay cross-dresser really seemed odd for Pitt's character. Despite the above-mentionned weaknesses, Iceberg was still entertaining enough to deserve three stars."
2,Skip this one,"This is one Pitt novel you should skip. I kept waiting for the plot to grab my attention, and now that I've finished the book, I'm still waiting."
1,maximum stupidity,"I really can't think of a more horrible book that I've read besides ""Iceberg"". The prose is bad, the story is boring and the fight at the end of the book happens in Disneyland. Come on."
1,Good beginning degenerates into sexist trash,"A coast guard patrol plane swoops over an iceberg and lo! It spots a strange shadow in the ice. It turns out a large fishing trawler has somehow become embedded in the ice! Hmm, cool premise (sic), does the book deliver? NO WAY. Written in the early 70's but really something that has all the narrowmindedness of something from the 30s, this potboiler has a James Bondish hero that you can't wait for the bad guys to hurt, sexist and homosexist lingo that is supposed to be amusing but is just gut-plunging nauseating. Insipid dialog, plastic characters, cartoon villains, this one has it all. Save your money"
1,"Horrid, outdated, very poorly executed","One of the worst books I have read; outrageous storyline, very amateurish writing, ridiculous story..What a waste of time..Misogynous, overtly pathetically homophobic for no apparent reason than to add some off-colors to the story; it made no sense, and was so far fetched; one can suspend reality only so much before the absordity sets in..The hero was nothing but a caricature, plot holes abound, inconsistencies all around topped with a most ludicrous ending...AVOID...."
1,Utterly Ridiculous,"Ridiculous. What a ridiculous story. One of his earlier efforts, Clive Cussler fortunately, went on to write much better books. The plot is contrived and does not hold together well, the characters are unsympathetic, and there's an unfortunate amount of chauvinistic behavior towards women. The story line is not worth going into, it's never believable, not for a single minute.The Dirk Pitt character is extremely unlikable for a main character, I'm not sure if Cussler thinks he might appeal to some men as an alter ego they want to be like. However, the author is not able to pull this off - Dirk Pitt comes across as a kind of third-rate James Bond - he has the killer instinct, but none of the cool sophistication. Reading Iceberg left me cold."
3,A book to be read when you are extremely bored!,"This book is one of those novels where you want to find out what happens next, but can wait. This is the first Dirk Pitt book that I have read and it is pretty good (but it is no indiana jones). BUT DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE COVER, IT IS NOT A NONSTOP ACTION THRILLER! It is all around, a non-suspensful book, with a little bit of action. I think it is a book you should get from the library. The story plot was thin, but it did start out ok!"
1,A Story as Cold as Ice.,"A Story as Cold as Ice.When I read my first Dirk Pitt Adventure book, it had me turning pages like there was no tomorrow. When Cussler made this book, he was thinking of making buck not a book. The new Iceberg is half as thin, and half as good as it should be. The author jumped through the adventure, not telling us in good English what happens. The book starts out great, and has you flipping through pages in wonder. Then the point dulls, and you have to keep on stopping to think: what does he mean? And it only gets even worse. With a book like this, you can correctly predict the ending one hundred pages away. It all starts when a blazing ship melts into an iceberg and is found a year later. Of course, Dirk Pitt is sent to investigate and has a wild time with lots of twists. Unfortunately, to tell anymore would give the story away. Final conclusion: go spend your money on a real book."
4,Cussler - always entertaining,"I enjoyed this book very much. Cussler is like an old friend that never lets you down and you feel at home with. Escapist ""trash"" with characters that would be great fun to have a beer with after they finish saving the world"
2,One of Cussler's weaker works,"I have to concede that I am relatively new to Clive Cussler and have only read six of his books, all of which are Dirk Pitt adventures written solely by the great man himself. I had high hopes for this novel, having come off a fabulos run of previous Cussler novels including some earlier works, but sadly it was a disappointment. The key issue being that the book lacked the chemistry created by the Dirk Pitt and Al Giordina banter and schtick. The other wearing aspect of the novel was Pitt camping it up to ensure the antagonist underestimated him. That might have been fine 20-30 years ago, but reading this type of plot device today seems dated. Another example is the way in which the female character (Tiddi) was written (i.e. as a weak dumb woman). Having said this there is a nice twist at the end, which I quite enjoyed. Probably only one for diehard Cussler fans."
2,Too much going on....,"Pretty good book as far as fun and games go, but I wish Mr. Cussler would tone it down a bit with larger-than-life plots and ridiculous ideas. This book would be indefinitely better if the scope of the story did not involve whole continents, 500 presidents, millions of people and so on.Dirk Pitt was meant to be likeable and desireable. Instead, he comes off as an arrogant, selfish fool, who is extremely sure of himself, an apparent sexist, homophobic megalomaniac, and a killer with no remorse, who always finds a way to explain away blowing up people and shooting a person or two.I only recommend this book if you have nothing else to read or if your other reading choice is a local newspaper. There just isn't anything believable about this particular story and the characters are not likeable - there is nothing one can relate to in this book."
2,Not nearly as good as Cussler's later work,"A co-worker told me about Clive Cussler's books and I started out by reading, Flood Tide, Atlantis Found, Trojan Odyssey, and Black Wind. All of these were great books that I had trouble stepping away from. Next, I read Iceberg. Iceberg was originally released in 1975 and is one of Cussler's earliest works. It was okay but not even close to being as good as the other books I had read to that point. Cussler's skills have obviously improved over time. I would suggest to anyone new to Cussler to start out with his later work and then go back to his earlier work if you are still interested."
3,Good read,"This was my first trip into the ""NUMA files"" and I have to say it was a very fun read. The plot held my attention and kept me turning page after page, I ended up reading it in about three days...becuase I couldnt put it down.There was a bit of a sexest attitude toward women...""DOnt worry your pretty little head, and go make me some coffee"" attitude throughout. But, it was still a good book. I am going out to get the rest of the Dirk Pitt novels."
4,"Good, solid Dirk adventure.","Entertaining early Dirk Pitt adventure with a good plot, great locales, some surprising twists and a number of classic--and brutal!--Dirk moments. Word to the wise: if you've yet to read this one avoid the next reviews as they contain considerable spoilers."
2,"Good ideas, bad execution","Cussler's books are usually well driven plot-wise, but his actual writing has improved since this turkey was published.I've read several of Cussler's works (and enjoy the NUMA files more than Pitt, by the way), and found them to be fairly standard adventures with facinating plot twists. But the characters often are a bit flat.This is by far the worst of the Cussler works I have read. Even for its time, the misogyny is overpowering and the (not so)latent homophobia is annoying as well. Many of the characters are as flat as the paper they are presented on.Cussler got better in his writing and his characterizations (if only a bit), and his works make for good beach/down time reading. But give this early work a miss."
3,"There's a ship in an ICEBERG, but not for too long. Not his best, but still enjoyable.","For A book, Pry one of the best. But for a Clive Cussler novel, well, not so good. I never really did get what the deal was with Tidi, 'cause when has she been an interesting character, she's a secretary! And what about Kirsi Fyrie? Is she supposed to be Dirk's girlfriend? I mean, COME ON, she's in the book for about 7 chapters altogether. What about Christian fyrie? He's in chapter 3 (or was it 4?) as a dead corpse, with alot of junk on his hands. Do I have to mention the probe, it was mabye mentiontioned 2 times.But the plot was kept good at all times, and the main adventure took place at Disneyland, on the ride Pirates Of The Carrribean, where they fought like there was no tommorow. A creative idea. Read this one after the ingeniosly crafted story Raise the Titanic, even though it came first, so you can see how different this was then the famous Titanic fantasy."
2,Not his best work-not even plausible,"Some of the stuff in this book was so hokey that I almost hurled. Like bein' able to see a boat through a few feet of ice, or the shootout in Disneyland. Dirk Pitt just isn't a believable character--just your standard issue dashing, cynical, super-agent surrounded by a buncha standard issue sidekicks including the grumpy cigar-chomping general."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"I enjoyed this book, the plot was good, characters were alright, but I jus think it could have been much better... First, where was Dirk's friend Giordino from the first book? Theres no mention of him at all in this one... But the plot was good, the last little turn at the end I thought was a little predictable, but overall a great read, cant wait to read Raise The Titanic !!!"
3,Qxygen Workout Music Volume,"I am an aerobics instructor and I much prefer original artists when I choose music. This CD has great vocls and good music. I use it to warm up. It is too slow for the cardio portion of my workout. When describing a volume and the word HIGH is in its description, it should specify how many BPM are being promoted. When I see High on a CD, I am gaging that workout will be in the neighborhood of 150-165 BPM or even higher. This CD is in the 125 range."
3,Less Than I Expected,"I have most of Vollenweider's CDs already, but was willing to purchase this one because I was interested in the remixed versions. In my opinion these ""new"" versions have not changed enough to justify the price of the CD. However, if you intend to purchase only one Vollenweider disc, this would be a good one. My recommendation: purchase a used disc."
4,Classic...,just wanted to also pass my review along. i pretty much love all of the songs on this one album. i have listened to it who knows on and off over the last 8-9 years and its one i could never forget. i am glad others know of it as well. i would recommend to anyone.ps. thanks to jason for recommending this to me way back when it came out. can you believe i never forgot about it :)
4,... a box,Let's face it ... it's an empty box. Ande the only reason why I bought it is because I was tired of all the bob vehicles lying around on the floor. At least this way my son enjoys cleaning them up. The material of the box is much sturdier than expecte and it comes with a set of stickers ... so you can assign a space to each vehicle.
5,game show at it finest,Thank you to all the people who put MXC together. You have given me hours of great entertainment. The quick thinking names and commentary are TOP NOTCH. It is worth every dollar Amazon.com is asking for.
1,Let Down,"Would not recommend buying. Not only do you have to buy Volume 4 to get the rest of season 3 episodes, they left out the first episode Almost Live (and not on Volume 4 or volume 5) which was the best and they put Season 3, Episode 11: CSI/Forensics vs. Children's EntertainmentSeason 3, Episode 12: The Master Debaters on Volume 4 messing up the order of the episodes."
1,What the BLEEP?!?,My DVD set arrived with Disc 1 and Disc 1. Has anyone else received the same thing?
2,NOT all episodes in season three,WARNING: You do not get all of season three. Season three consisted of 27 episodes. Here you only get 13 episodes.
2,weakest of the series,"Of the three seasons this is definately the weakest of them. It has a new (and lousy )announcer and is edited to pieces, maybe for legal reasons? Rent don't buy and this is coming from a big MXC fan."
4,Father's Day Gift,"Daddy, Will You Dance With Me? by Sandra Schoger Foster celebrates special moments between fathers and daughters throughout all stages of life. It is a beautiful little gift book, perfect for Father's Day or any special occasion you want to impart love to someone who may have everything."
5,Sweet Book,"This book was a gift for me from my daughter. It is a sweet book that illustrates a close relationship that a father and daughter can and should have throughout their lives. What a blessing from God our children are! It's so important to cultivate and maintain that closeness as we go through life, being there for each other."
3,Not very convincing afterlife material.,"I really feel sorry for the author of this book. After the loss of her daughter, this grieving mother is desperately searching for answers. She starts to think that different coincidences in her life (she calls it ""synchronicity"") are messages from her daughter from beyond the grave. While some of her experiences are unusual, she interprets things like finding a penny on the ground or hearing a popular song on the radio as a sign from her daughter. At one point she interprets finding a penny with the current year on it as meaning that her daughter wanted her to make a new start. Everytime she sees a picture of a rose, she thinks her daughter is trying to tell her something. Clearly, if we are looking for a particular symbol, we will find it, because you would have overlooked it if you weren't searching for it. It's nice that these experiences helped her to cope with a tragic loss, but it's definitely not convincing afterlife reading."
5,2nd Purchase,"I read this book over 15 years ago, lent it to a friend and haven't seen it since. I remember feeling extraordinarily good as i read her words; i can't explain it. I just felt happy. Synchronicity is definitely more than just a word, it's enveloping to all of your senses. i don't think will ever get my book back, so i am buying another one, and that's ok; it has probably helped many people since it left my hands..."
3,Beware then be happy,"I recommend this only to experienced Norton users who are aware of the pitfalls (no support, labyrinth of looping phone menus and a web site worthy of any soviet bureaucracy). Uninstall any previous versions completely--even earlier Norton products--and restart before beginning the install. Don't put this on any machine older than a couple of years as each edition since 2003 dogs the speed and performance of the computer to a point you'd weigh the consequences of operating in the wide open without protection (not recommended unless you're a potential client of mine with lots of spare change). NIS does a great job when it's set up and running properly. I like Ghost and have moved many clients away from traditional backup programs to it and I appreciate that they include the older version for older operating systems. Symantec makes some good products and is that infamous 900 lb. gorilla, but it could be soooooooooo much more if had even an inkling of real support."
3,Half and Half,"Half the deal is good. The Norton Internet Security is cheaper than on the Symantec website, so that's a good bargain. The Ghost, though, is really quite an annoying program. It does back up the data (supposedly), but there isn't a way that I could find to get it OFF the hard drive so I'm not sure how it will help, considering if the hard drive crashes, it is unusable. It also really slows down the function of other programs because it is constantly running in the background. I ended up deleting the entire program from my computer and hoping for the best. Therefore, I'd suggest that you just go ahead and buy the Internet Security alone."
2,This was a Bloated package... VS the NEw 2009 / 2010 Norton IS is LIGHT / FAST,Bloated .... KAspersky was ruling all over this back then. Now NIS 2010 is neck & neck with Kaspersky depending on which testers & virus/web threats thrown at them (that you read).
2,Norton Internet Security 2006,Seems to be thorough but it frequently slows down my operating system so that it is unusable. I need to temporarily disable Norton to be able to use other applications. I have been warned by others this is a problem unless you are using a higher performance PC. I would not recommend this product.
3,Decent,This product has caught me 1 largemouth and a bunch of sun fish. It is a very small lure and the hook is hard to set on bigger fish.
5,great glow in the dark ball,this ball is great if you want to shoot around at night and dont have the lurury of a gym to go to. i just put it in front of my headlights on my car for a few minutes and i'm ready to play for a few hours. very cool.
2,Lame,"My two complains are (1) after leaving that thing in front of a light for 15+ minutes, it glows for like 30 minutes, which is less time than what is useful. Secondly, (2) the size of 28.5 inches in circumference, which I understand is advertised, but the word 'official' is confusing without specifying official 'for children / WNBA)'.On the plus it still beats any other ball while playing at night since it is white."
2,It does not glows up as it should. Only one half of the ball lights up at night.,Its a nice ball but it only lights up one half of the ball at night. I returned it to Amazon. It's a nice idea for night outdoors games but the glowing quality if not good enough.
3,Decent for night-time shooting,"This ball was OK, nothing special. It handles a bit awkwardly, not having quite enough bounce to it. It also has a tendency to lose air a little. Maybe mine was defective or something but I had to re-pump it once ever 3-4 days. The glow worked really good at the beginning, you could see it from blocks away. It faded over a couple of months though, maybe I left it in the light too long.Also, if you're planning to play outdoors and you have a problem with your court being dusty then this ball is not for you. If it gets dirty then it covers the glow and you're better off getting some sort of a light if possible.Overall I think this ball is OK for shooting around or having a fun pick up game, but I wouldn't use it to practice dribbling or playing an actual competitive game."
2,"Smelly plastic, toxic?","It is a very cool ball and really glows but it smells really bad. Your hands will smell afterwords. Remember reading that the glow in the dark plastics can be toxic, just makes me wonder about this ball."
2,basketball,Purchase as a gift and am very unhappy with quality. The basketball will not stay inflated.1 1 1 1 1
3,Item is not what is shown in picture.,"I ordered this leather looking pouch type baton holder and received a hard plastic clip on holder. It is a nice swivel ASP clip scabbard, (3 3/4"" long) but not what I wanted. Amazon's item model number 52237 matches what I got, but no way resembles the picture. I wanted a scabbard that would conceal the baton. I will probably keep what I got because I don't think they have a scabbard as pictured."
1,WHAT THE HECK?,THEY MESSED UP THIS ONE. Half the footage was cut oout of the video DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
4,Good Album,"Angel Corpse play fast, tight,and somewhat old school, but brutal music. Nothing ground breaking, but still good. What really made me want to review this is the guy up there who said DISGORGE is dumb and not technical. Disgorge from California are very Brutal, Heavy and yes technical, Check them out! You dont need to put down other bands to praise another..."
4,"Mindblowing, vicious technical death metal","I gave this album 4 stars because, although it's trully an amazing album and one of my favorites, it's a real doozy to listen to. I both love and hate this technical death metal stuff because, even though it's incredibly awesome to listen to, it takes a few listens to get used to. It took me a few weeks to catch all the zings and zangs and little hooks and subtleties that make this album make sense. After I caught all that, this became one of the best albums in my collection. But until I got used to crazy rhythms and off-kilter time changes, it just seemed like a garbled mess. So beware. If you're easily befuddled by technical music, stay away. But if you like your death metal incredibly talented and crazy, buy this album!"
1,Terrible,"This CD was terrible for me. I was looking for something good to run with or use on the elyptical machine. Every song is 200 beats per minute and every song sounds exactly the same. There really isn't any words to the songs and definetly not useful to be motivating. This might be good for background music for step areobics or something, but terrible for the average listener! I was very disapointed..."
4,First of many readings by Author Kelly Kenyatta,"After reading the intros of ""Red Hot Halle"" and ""Aaliyah"" on Kelly Kenyatta's site, my appetite grew to learn more of the two stars. I was excited when my book order arrived. I tore into the package and started reading Halle until my eyes couldn't stay open any longer because I couldn't stop reading. I'm almost through reading it and I'm enjoying every bit of it. I felt like I was there.............. When I picked the book up the next day to finish reading it, I found out there were only two pages left, but I was yearning for more, more............. I like Kelly Kenyatta's style. Her explanations of the other people in her stories are informative. It brings people like me, who don't know them, up to date and put me/us in a familiar time and a place. I couldn't wait to start reading Aaliyah. I have become a fan of Author Kelly Kenyatta."
4,A concise overview,"Mellinkoff's THE MARK OF CAIN was originally published in 1981 by the University of California Press. Focused primarily on material produced during the medieval period, Mellinkoff surveys the history of the legend of Cain and the nature of his mark as represented in literary texts and the visual arts from antiquity to the twentieth century. The book is fully indexed, contains a bibliography and endnotes, and concludes with 22 plates of reproduced artwork."
2,Not what you would expect-- ---in a bad way!,"When I saw that this cd had the bomb hip hop logo I thought it must be good, since I have loved all of their other compilations. But this cd was not what I expected. I was thinking it would be a turntablist alblum, with scratching and trickery, but it wasn't. It is basically just old 80's electro. It sounds like it could easily have been made by some dude with a little free time and an electric synthesizer. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly horrible, it's just not worth [price]. Maybe if the tracks would have been mixed toghether it would have given the alblum more life. When I listen to this cd I imagine Gary Coleman breakdancing naked in his basement."
1,"Does not work , can not recommend",I bought 2 while I was in the US and unfortunately the do not fit in the in Germany and after I bought an adapter they did not work.Both did not deliver the correct voltage.
1,Completely useless,"Too bad I lost my money on buying two of those. One of the two stops working after seconds, the other broke down after a minute. Just hope people will read reviews and not waste their money as I did."
1,don't buy it,It will not fit into any standard wall receptacle or extension cord in Germany ... the SIMRAN engineering team failed to know german standards!
1,Poorly researched data; factual errors,"I just received my copy yesterday and am up to the beginning of the ""D"" section (the movies are listed alphabetically) and I've already been disappointed by numerous factual errors by the writer (writer rather than ""author"" because the title ""author"" carries with it a certain level of professional expertise which seems scarce in this book). For example, her description of the story line for Creature from the Black Lagoon obviously is confused with the story line for one of the sequels to that film and is totally wrong. Most disappointing."
1,Can't Judge A Book By It's Cover - or Title,"I so looked forward to this book! Sounded great, reading all those memories,experiences and and recollections of ""golden era"" horror films. I counted exactly one memory, in the forward. This is NOT a book about memories. It's more reference book than nostalgia. It's a book of one to two page synposis with partial cast and crew listings for several dozen horror movies. Sort of an expanded TV guide listing. But the real monster here is the misleading title. I will attempt to get my money back, because I believe the title is ethically on very shaky ground."
4,A brilliant electro-tech-house mix from Tiga - better than Sexor?!,"Like many of you, I've been waiting for Tiga's debut album, Sexor, for quite a long time - although it just came on out on import, it still isn't available in the States - and even then, I feel it's a tad disappointing; sure the singles are there, but not much more - but THIS brilliant double-mix-CD by TIGA and Australian DJ AJAX is a value-for-the-$ collection of the coolest, hottest electro-tech-house tracks of today and tomorrow - really, not one bad track in the mix, including several of Tiga's own hard to find singles & remixes - I especially like traxx/mixes from Justus Kohncke, Thomas Anderson, Dieter Schmidt, Freeform Five, and more - if you tried to buy all these import/promo 12""s to create this mix, you'd have to spend hundreds of dollars, so $20 bucks is a steal!"
5,Very good description of product,This is exactly what I was looking for! Site did very good job of describing the product and providing photos of it.
4,Hope it holds up,Can't give it 5 stars since I don't know if it will hold up. I have had to order this handle twice now and they tend to break easily. For now it is working as we wanted
5,Great!,"Despite what amazon garage says, this product does fit a Chevy S10. It is pretty sturdy, comes with all the necessary hardware, and it is easy to install. Can't ask for much more."
4,Kenny At His Best,"Had all of Kenny's songs. Was especially looking for his songs with the First Edition. If you remember those, you're showing your age along with me. Was completely satisfied."
5,Something Special,This single seems to be exactly what the dance community needs. The song is not too fast or too slow. I can't wait for the song to arrive in the stores. Keep up the good work Trina & Tamara
2,Sure Didn't last long,"While the wood parts were fine, the grinder mechanism snapped a few months after I bought it. Seems cheaply made."
2,IMPORTANT! WRONG PRESSING!,"I bought a new, unwrapped copy of this rare, out-of-print CD from an Amazon vendor. However, the manufacturer screwed up. The wrong album got pressed onto this CD. Instead of the 10 tracks that are supposed to be on this CD, there were 12 tracks. Instead of them being songs from 1956 to 1966, they were songs from the early 1950s from artists like Perry Como, Bing Crosby and Doris Day. I got a refund from the vendor but my next step is to try and contact Vintage Collectables. The only reason I bought this CD in the 1st place was to get the song Pink Shoelaces by Dodie Stevens. That song in itself is hard to find and it's not available as a download either. It's hard enough to get pre-Beatle era Top 40 songs these days so needless to say, I was really annoyed that this happened."
4,Nice little bag to hold a body and lens,"I'm using this bag when I want to travel really light.Several configurations:1. Body + Small zoom + primeD80 + 17-50mm + 50f1.82. Body + Small zoom + speedlightD80 + 17-50mm + SB600 (Tighter fit but it works well).If you've ever used an older Domke, you'll know how difficult the metal clips are to open. On this model, however, the clip on the shoulder strap is really easy to open. I hope Domke implements it on more models."
5,Perfect fit!,What a perfect choice to carry a digital camera and extras with you throughout your day. It can fit a Canon G9 with plenty of protection and room to spare for wide angle lens and mini tripod.
4,"nice small photo bag, with reservations","i got this to hold my Panasonic FZ50 and accessories. the size and shape are perfect for that, and the bag is a comfortable carry. I disliked the very loud label- this is a stealth photo bag, so why announce that it is a Domke? Luckily, my wife removed that annoyance. also, there is no place *inside* for a permanent identification tag. fix these and it's a great bag for a small photo kit."
2,Nice bag for m43 - but wax all over gear & clothes,"This bag could be really nice. It fits my OM-D with all 4 lenses + flash + filters + spare battery. Perfect size, really.What is not so good is the wax treatment. After opening and closing the flap a couple of times, the wax is on your hands. From there it goes to your camera and the lenses. And stays there. I just pulled to camera out of my Pelican case for some shots. Still full of wax from the last time I carried it around in the Domke (last month!). The wax will also rub off the bag and onto your clothes. Not good neither (I live in Northern CA, moderate temperatures. Can only imagine the problem is worse in warm weather).Wax and photo gear is not a good combination, so that Domke bag stays at home very often..."
2,Domke quality has slipped,Domke has noticeably lowered the quality and size of the F-5XB compared to another F-5XB I purchased a few years back. The padding is no where near quality it was before. I would have rather paid a higher price for the F-5XB and received a better built bag.
2,bag too small for me,"I purchased the Domke F-5xb camera bag through Amazon. When it arrived on Mar 9 I removed it from the boxI put my Nikon D60 camera with lens attached in the bag but there was not enough room for anything else.The bag was too narrow. After looking it over, and thinking about it. I decided to return it to Amazon fora refund.On tuesday Mar 10 I ordered the Tamrac adventure 4 camera bag from Amazon. I received it Mar 12.The Tamrac bag is a big improvement. And I'm satisfied with it. Willie"
2,The bag which could've been great...,"Domke has some good products and some not so great ones. This is the latter.I had to remove the velcro so I wouldn't wake up the neighbourhood every time I took out my camera. Then, if the red badge wasn't loud enough, the strap buckles definitely were. Can only just hold a Leica and a couple of lenses, and looks too much like a ladies handbag to pass as a ""discreet"" camera bag.Not recommended for street photography. Save your money and get a Billingham instead.."
5,It's a Pelican,"In my line of work I do a lot of traveling. The conditions are somewhat austere, and I wanted a ""suitcase"" that can haul my equipment and clothing around in complete protection. I wanted something that has a military appearance, and that I could use as a footlocker that I can sit on or work on. This is what I got and it's perfect. Not too big not too small. It's a Pelican case, waterproof, weather proof, bullet proof. Get it with the 1659 lid oraganizer."
2,Pelican case w/foam 1650,"I was disappointed when I received the case because it was different than the one portrait in the advertisement. The carrying handle and the closing devices/hasps are different than the ones I already owned. I am beginning to suspect that this case is a just a bad replica of the original. I am saying this because I already own a 1650 case that I bought at a military store and the cases are different. In addition, the case shown in the picture is not the same I receive. Again, not happy with the case I received."
5,Gay Asian Softcore,"If you like to watch young asian men (with naturally hot bodies and very cute faces) exercising and then relaxing in the shower and steam room, you will enjoy this dvd. There is no frontal nudity however there are some very hot shower and steam room scenes."
1,Not What It Appears to Be,"I was trying to buy an audio portion of the BBC series, ""All Creatures Great & Small"". What I got was a compilation of different artists, none of whom Ifelt were worth listening to. They did not make clear in the description of this item that it was NOT from the BBC series, and again, Amazon made no attempt to make the seller be more honest. This is the second time I've been stung on Amazon by sellers not being forthright about their products and in both instances, were trading on someone else's name. Doesn't help to contact Amazon, because they don't address the problem.Just beware - this is NOT an audio from the BBC series and I don't think you'd like the ""music"" on this CD. I returned mine immediately.Be careful with Amazon. They are not careful with how they label itemsfor sale and show no interest in fixing errors."
2,Greasy Hair,"I bought a bottle of this because my mom had a bottle when I visited. It smelled so nice and made my hair really easy to style. But after using it for a couple weeks my hair just feels greasy all the time. This is really weird because I have very dry hair. It's not for me. So, the quest goes on."
5,Gets the job done!!!,"After trying everything under the sun for my 11 year old daughter, we finally tried Bed Head Self Absorbed Mega Nutrient shampoo and what a difference it makes!!! The other stuff would never really get her hair clean, it always looked and felt a little grimy and dull. Now, after using Bed Head, her hair is silky shiny again and clean as a whistle like it was when she was much younger. My hair can pretty much handle any ol shampoo but my daughter is another story... This absolutely works for her and with Amazon prime and subscribe & save discounts it costs about the same as other name brand department store shampoos!!"
4,A great deal - great scent - handy,"I love the large pump bottle. I see some don't...but for me, it is the best thing since sliced bread. Great for the shower. The price was right too.Also, my hair color lasted well with this (mild?) shampoo. Scent is fruity and yummy. Kind of a cross between melon and grapefruit.My only fault with this shampoo is that there isn't a lot of lather with it. I found myself using more, more, more to get the lather I enjoy. Three squirts. I am used to more lather with only a third less from costlier shampoos. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Great product crappy bottle,"I love BedHead Self Absorbed so much that I even ordered it as a subscribe and save. The first bottle I received was damaged during shipping. Not a huge deal, they replaced immediately. The only problem was the bottle itself. I knocked a bottle into the shower and the bottom broke! So I thought ok not so bad yet but out of 3 bottles, All three have broken!! I am very disappointed with the packing. I guess I will have to go back to Paul Mitchell!"
3,hype,"The shampoo was introduced through a sample single shampoo packet. The single use packet seemed to tingle to the hairfollicles. With the thought that the shampoo would be beneficial to healthy hair, two containers were purchased but the tinglingsensation was not present. So the tingling was one time marketing tool to entice. duped"
5,"Great book, easy transactio","Fast shippment, no problems, book was exactly as described. Recommend to other buyers and I would definitely do business with them again. Thanks."
1,machine made poorly brook after first hour.,poor machine brook after first hour all i did was put candy in it and put the first amount of money and it brook. cost me anther $30 to fix it.
5,Splendid Spur,"I was very interested in receiving this book as it gave insight of King Charles I & II from their servant's point of view. I received a behind the scene view of the kings. For being very old, this book was in very good condition and I take pride in ownership. Thank you."
5,I wore this one out. I came to order a new copy.,"This book offers some very tasty (but not low-fat, really, but who needs it?) and simple recipes with fun titles like ""Salmon Ella"", ""Pro-Pasto Salad (I've Never Been Anti-Pasto)"". It also offers menus of what to have for certain events like a barbecue and when the boss comes for dinner, that sort of thing. I also thought the artwork complemented the humor of the book. The Butterscotch Banana Bread was the best I've ever made. Check out ""My Mother-in-Law's Meatloaf"" and then ""My Meatloaf"", both on the same page for comparison."
5,Gift for a grandson,"He was absolutely delighted with this set and I imagine we'll continue to get other sets for birthday gifts, etc."
1,Back To 1966..or 67?,"Like most everyone else, I first heard ""Start The Commotion"" on the Mitsubishi TV commercial and it didn't take long for these 48-year old ears to say ""Hey I already got that on an old Ventures album"". Within minutes of looking through my old vinyl, I had located the track ""Wild Child"" from the The Ventures' ""Wild Things"" album circa 1966 or 67. ""STC"" directly lifts the starting bass line from the Ventures piece and the short guitar rift is the first 3 notes from Nokie Edwards' lead guitar work from Wild Child. Hope The Ventures are getting their royalties for this one. Wanna hear the original? Try finding a copy of Wild Things; The Ventures; Liberty / Dolton Label BST-8047."
1,Disappointed,"I was excited that this was the long version of that cool Mitsubishi commercial ""Start the Commotion"" and really hoped that at the very least a few more songs on the CD would be a little similar to that cool hip sound. Let's just say that I was very disappointed to find that is the ONLY song (in my opinion of course) that I liked on the entire CD."
1,I learned my lesson . . .,"The wonders that remixing a song to 30 seconds and laying images of models in a sportscar over it can bring. This album is simply trashy, distracted, and soulless. The comparison to Fatboy is totally apt, as neither one can crank out a song without the utmost concentration, preferring instead to loop grating samples and inane lyrics around beats with the attention span of a fly. Why did I think that there would be some funk and some juice here? Oh yeah, those models in the sportscar . . ."
2,A pearl among swine.,"Ooh la la very good, cowboy 78 very good, start the commotion great (that's why it's in the commercial) rest of the album hip hop, tribute to a hooker, rap (with a xylophone?) a bunch of time consuming noise. You would have to like start the commotion very much to buy this CD so I did."
3,Maybe not for everyone,"I liked ""Ooh,lala"" and ""Start the conmotion"" a lot,but the rest seemed a little repetitive and monotonous to me,I couldn't make myself like the entire cd,but,then again,I just bought the whole thing because of the Mitsubishi ad..."
3,Not really commotion but just okay,"The Wiseguys' ""Antidote"" has some great moments. Of course there are the snippets that Mitsubishi took for the commercial - those are the most well known. They sample from a variety of sources including classical pieces and spoken word, and rework them in sometimes surprising combinations. In the end, however, those snippets are just that - brief moments - and the album descends into repetitive hooks ad infinitum. By the time you get to ""Start the Commotion,"" and picture yourself cruising with the sexy women and men in your imaginary sports car, you've figured out the formula for the ""Antidote."" Which makes listening to the last few tracks a bit forced. If the Wiseguys' goal for the ""Antidote"" was to create background music for commercials and parties, they definately succeeded. But if they ever want to create something that lasts beyond the first listen, they need to learn how to push harder at the edges."
1,One hit wonders,"The only great song that this band has, is ""start the commotion"" as heard in the Mitsubishi commercial. This will be their only hit; it's the only good song on the album."
3,"If there is a cd single somewhere, get it","For most, this will be that cd you bought for the one song and the rest turns out to be [...bad]. For me, there are a few tracks that at least made me feel I didnt totally waste my money. Track one is pretty decent and Cowboy 78' I think is tight. Ooh La La you might listen to a few times over but kind of grows old after a while. And of course Start the Commotion is smoov. But overall the cd is average to the big beat fan and some [...] to the ""buying it cuz of the commercial"" fan. This is Big A in the Hiz-A keepin it Riz-eel"
4,Great groove here......,"In a world of what seems like a trillion DJ LPs here's one that's worth giving a listen.""The Antidote"" covers a wide variety of beats and grooves ranging from bumpin' club style hits such as ""Start The Commotion"" (yes that is the song from the Mitsubishi commercial) to chilled out trip hop beats like ""Face The Flames"".The use of some super old lounge and jazz samples is great, and the rhymes on cuts 3 & 11 hold their own."
4,"Even before all the TV hype, this CD was hot","Yeah, the Wiseguys' songs have been overplayed thanks to numerous TV commercials and movie soundtracks. I had this CD before all the hoopla. I loved it then, and I still love it now. Some CD listeners have complained that only the more danceable songs (e.g., Ooh La La and Start the Commotion) are good. I feel that you have to listen to the whole CD start to finish to really enjoy it. It's a total music experience that varies from downtempto hip-hop to big beat-ish dance music to mellow grooves with interesting samples....but in my book, this is one of the better CDs of its genre. If you like it, also check out Handsome Boy Modeling School."
3,A good pick up for Big Beat fans,"If you like Fatboy Slim, that's big beat. And the Wiseguys follow suit, and that they do it well helps. I was particularly impressed with the tracks 'Ooh, La La' 'Cowboy '78' 'Start the Commotion' and 'Grabbin Hands' which has serious hip hop roots. They manage to combine good production value along with creative sample selection for a good sound. Granted there were a few songs to skip over, but the overall mood of fun the fumes from this effort is overpowering. The track 'We Be The Crew' just taunts you into thinking that you should write your own lyrics and flow right along with the beat. This is a good pick up for any fan of Big Beat, or Hip-Hop for that matter."
3,Enjoyable but Forgettable,"I have listened to this album about four or five times now, and there are only two songs out of fifteen(!) that I have any memory of whatsoever - ""Ooh La La"" (which I had heard before) and ""Start the Commotion."" Other than that, the whole album passes by without leaving any lasting impression on me. Granted, it's certainly enjoyable big beat and good to have on in the background, but there just isn't enough memorable music on this album to warrant further listening."
1,start the commotion rocks,"I bought this CD for ""start the commotion"" and it rocks but the other 14 tracks were a disappointment. Start the commotion seems out of place with the rest, hip hop or whatever that is called. I say trash but you decide. Please listen before you buy. I did buy this for the one tune mentioned, so I do not feel that I got gypted. Start the commotion delivers 5 full minutes of driving/listening pleasure."
3,Bought It For One Song,"This is the group that produced the hyper-catchy ""Start the Commotion"" which is currently used in a car commercial. If you know the commercial and love the song, buy the CD, cause the tune's never going to get out of your head till you do. Aside from that track, this is an average, Euro-[junk] ""is it rap or techno or what?"" album."
4,"""Start the Commotion""","The song ""Start the Commotion"" is the best song! I first heard it on a comercial. Then I started hearing all the time on the raido. Now I can't stop listening to it!"
5,Short & effective!,"This is a great all-over toning workout when you're short on time or want to pair it up with a short cardio workout. Be advised that there is more emphasis on the lower body than the upper, but the squat & calf work alone are worth the price of admission. If you don't have the Firm's sculpting stick a weighted bar or body bar can be substituted & light dumbbells can be used during the 'twigs' portion. (These twigs weigh 2 lbs each)Just choose weight for your fitness level. In some cases the stick is used for balance so a wooden dowel or broom handle would work as well. While I wouldn't use this sculpting workout exclusively, the unique moves may work your muscles differently enough to shake up your exercise routine so you will see continued results. Pam cues exceptionally well & beginner modifications are always shown. The music is decent & in my opinion & worth the 30 minutes of your time."
4,Good for what it is,"This workout presents itself as a minimal equipment workout,which it certainly is.And it is the usual Firm quality with good instructors.It will work your muscles in a different way but the lack of equipment does present major limitations.I would recommend this one as a travel video or an occasional addition to your usual routines to mix things up.It is a good tape but it won't be a mainstay for most people beyond the beginner level."
3,Trackman track worker,it a good learn item for me i had never used it but i have and exam and i see it good for me.
2,The Blankie vs. Dad's Pumpkins,"If your children still have a beloved blanket, they may find this story has a less than happy ending. Whether or not the quilt in the story is a gift from the garden or cosmos, cutting it up to protect pumpkins from frost seems rather cruel. Even if the little girl in the story couldn't bring it to kindergarten, she could've been comforted by it when she came home. Despite the rich colors and writing, I can't imagine any kindergartener willingly sacrificing such a wonderful lovey. Most would've been in hysterics to see such a thing cut apart before their eyes, just to protect vegetables. To have twelve jack-o-lanterns in return seems a pretty poor return on a very emotional investment."
1,Not Loving This Purchase!!,This peeler is awkward for me because I can only use it with a downward motion. It takes off too much flesh when peeling potatoes and carrots. Poor design. This one is destined for the trash bin.
2,A bitter disappointment,"Tin Machine II is significantly worse than Tin Machine, perhaps indicating that Bowie was tiring of his latest facade.It is, however, not unbearable. Most of the tracks can at least give you some old-fashioned rock n' roll bop.Baby Universal and Goodbye, Mr. Ed are a couple of the strongest tracks Bowie has ever written. Too bad practically no one will ever hear them."
4,Beautiful Bedding in a Bag,I was able to update a bedroom with new bedding in a bag. The colors & prints were easy to coordinate with other accessories and artwork to make an inviting space to retire to.
1,horrible fit. door lock wont stay in.,Do not buy these replacement handles. Go to a salvage yard or pick a part. These are not worth the hassle. I replaced the driver side handle in my 96 tahoe and these things just dont fit correctly. Money wasted. Next time i'll just go to the salvage yard and find some factory door handles.
4,"Well made, fit isn't perfect, easy to remedy.","Like other reviewers, I was a bit disappointed with the fit. It took me about two minutes with some black silicone and solvent to get it to look great (and not leak water into my door). Price was great, and it does seem to be a bit sturdier made than the OEM."
4,Informative and interesting,"This book isn't rocket science... But it is a great way to gain some sanity and understanding when your toddler is driving you mad. It explains why children do what they do, and that in most cases, annoying toddler behaviors are important developmental milestones and NOT just a child being 'naughty.'"
4,Good quick reference guide,"This book provides a quick and easy reference to common toddler behaviors. It is well researched and presented in a quick and easy format. It's not an in-depth child development or behavior modification book but does provide a handy format to look up target issues, find out why your child does things in a certain way or at a certain age, and offers tips for coping with the behaviors. Sometimes just knowing the why behind something is enough for a frustrated parent."
5,"Great book: fun, smart and practical",I read an excerpt from this book in Redbook and bought it on its first day. You can tell Jana Murphy really understands toddlers and did her homework for every chapter. The style is funny and honest and the book is full of suggestions you can really use.
3,An average read.,"This book wasn't what I was expecting. Easy to read and understand, but definitely - like another reviewer said - a lightweight. Good enough information, but not life-changing and not the first I'd reach for if I'm needing some guidance with my little guy."
3,Not a big picture book... but good for what it is.,"The book is fine, but it inst all that helpful for an overall picture of toddler behavior. It is great at explaining some examples (whey do they....) and is an easy read, but only a back up to your basic toddler behavior book (I like the happiest toddler on the block)"
3,The Bare Minimum,"I really thought this book would have a little more backround information. Like the above reviewer I felt it was very light. I don't think I would have purchased it if I had seen it in a store and flipped through the book. The most helpful section was on hitting, but it was still basically common sense or repeats of other information I have read."
2,Basically a magazine book,"This book shouldn't be called a book. The information is so light weight I would classify it as a compilation of articles from parents magazine. You can find this stuff anywhere, just go to babycenter and you will get the same, if not better information. Not enlightening, unless you have done zero research. So annoyed I payed for this thing!"
5,best book out on early american aviation!,"Before I read this book, I knew absolutely nothing about what it was like to fly in the early days of American aviation. After reading this book, I felt as if I had been there on each of the many dangerous flights that Tony Jannus had undertaken. What a man, what a man he must have been."
4,The author really knows his subject,"I met the author in Tampa Florida on April 18, 1998. His grasp of the subject as well as the subject of early American aviation is amazing. I encourage everyone to read this book. END"
4,A True Patriot,"The Journal of William Thomas Emerson is a story of a 12-year-old orphan boy. He makes friends in Boston, Massachusetts after his family died in a tragic fire. He learns of the horrors of the war, that he never thought was true. He loses a friend or two in the struggle for American freedom and finds that he, himself is a patriot awaiting for liberty. He puts his life in danger to help a group of patriots find the American cause. When his friend Henry is in danger, he is a true friend and finds the one thing that is necessary for him to say goodbye. This historical fiction book is a great book, and I recommend that you buy it."
2,Don't read it!,It wasn't very good in my opinion. It is about a 12 year old boy in 1774. His parents die and he runs away to Boston and lives with Mr. Wilson. He becomes a patriot messenger and helps find things out about the British.
1,The boring life of a colonial kid,1 This book The Journal of William Thomas Emerson is about a boy who's parents die when he is young and he is token in by a kind lady. He struggles day by day to keep business whill the British haras him.2 I thought this book was very boring because it was very stupid.3 This book has a lot of external conflict. It has a lot of external conflict because he must deal with the harasment of British soldiers.4 I gave this book one star because it was extremly booring. I do not recommend this book to anybody.
5,Involving Tale of Medieval Life,"Ann of Cambray is worth hunting Z-Shops and Auctions for. It is the beautiful tale of an intelligent and passionate woman living in the 12th century England. This is no fluff-romance tale. It is a tale of death and destruction, loyalty and alliances, murder and intrigue. Ann's love for her overlord complicates her life and sends her all over the kingdom in a desperate attempt for everything to be peaceful and settled. Castles and Kings fall in the struggle, men die and women mourn. And through it all Ann of Cambray forges bravely on. A wonderful tale written by an Oxford historian. Fascinating detail and endless surprising twists of fate."
5,Deaing with issues,"John went to a rodeo school to learn to ride bulls. John learns His new best friend, Kit is gay. Now John has to deal with riding bulls and pressure from his friends and family because they think being gay is indecent . Now riding bulls is easy compared to dealing with reality. He has to deal with his own sexuality and find out what is more important to him. What his friends and family think,or his friendship with Kit.I liked this book because I am interested in rodeo,and suggest anyone else who is interested in a rodeo drama to read this book."
3,Glad I read it but probably won't read it again.,This interesting book was almost more than I wanted to know about our current knowledge of the giant squid. Almost.The thing that made the biggest impression on me [and it was not a good one] was the sailor who stabbed the eye of a large squid. I just don't understand that kind of reaction to something unknown. If the giant squid were a real threat to mankind no one would go near the water.I shudder when I think of the brutal ways we have treated other members of the animal world. It is a good pick-up and put-down book. I read it at night in bed and it never kept me awake.
1,TERRIBLE writing on a fascinating topic,"I'm sure Richard Ellis is a fine fellow. But I just can't understand how _anyone_ gave this book a positive review, and I'm 2/3 through it. The redundancies are ridiculous; it's like he never reread or edited. So on page 108 he gives you a long quote from what he tells you is an article from Roper and Boss -- and in _the very next paragraph_ he gives you _the same quote_ again and attributes it! Amazing! And this kind of thing happens continually. How many times does he tell me how big, say, squid axons are versus human axons? I mean, really: this book went totally unedited. Beyond that the comments of other reviewers that he kind of struggles to fill a book about the squid, are true. Of course some of the amazing footage of the past couple years could've been used to pad it out another chapter, but, there's just not enough there there, or at least Ellis isn't able to make it seem so."
4,Almost scientifically accurate,"As a scientist, I had 2 objections. On p.48, he continues the myth that eyes of cephalopods and higher vertebrates exhibit the principle of ""convergence."" In fact, the eyes of mollusks, arthropods, & vertebrates derive from the PAX-6 gene, which has been highly conserved in evolution., This is NOT convergence. Ellis, p.241, confuses Insecta with Arachnida, when he describes the former as having ""eight eyes."" This is a confusionnin taxonomy on his part."
2,So-so (but exhaustive) survey of info about Giant Squid.,"This book covers a lot of information dating back quite far. The fact that extremely little is known about the Giant Squid makes the length of the book somewhat impressive. However, Ellis is not the best proofreader; he includes a fairly significant quote twice in three pages almost verbatim. His summary of the Squid in Literature and Film becomes fairly personal as he takes potshots at other historic authors. And his summary of Squid Models, while detailed, is a bit strange; substitute Train Models for Squid Models and the chapter becomes only slightly less relevant. This may have been included because it was a canned piece.The book is not nearly as good as I thought it would be, but it has its moments."
2,A monstrous disappointment,"I was looking for a good popular science book and this book sounded intruiging. However, it reads more like a senior thesis on the squid. Its sheer number of block quotes and accounts of similar sighting to similar sighting made it hard to get through. Also, he never really bothers to explain a lot of terms or give us a good introduction on the squid. Why is that Mr. Ellis? I guess because this book is for squidophiles with experience, and I was just looking for a good, informative read."
3,Rehashing of known information,"I've given ""Giant Squid"" a three star rating because it deals with a subject I am interested in. On the other hand, I expected more from it. There is little new here. It is a reasonably comprehensive overview of the mythos and known facts of Archeteuthis, the giant squid. It offers little, if anything new, and some opinions--such as the squid being a rather flaccid creature rather than a a highly mobile and active hunter--are almost certainly wrong.At the same time, my opinions are colored by the photographic findings of Japanese researchers of a powerful and mobile hunter of the depths. Rather than a giant hovering in the deeps, snagging occasional flotsam, fish and squid that drift by, we see a mobile, powerful creature that fought, possibly for hours, before tearing free and leaving a writhing tentacle.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"
2,More is written about the giant squid than is known.,"To paraphrase someone, I thought I'd like this sort of book, since this is the sort of book I like. But I didn't. The giant squid seems like a fascinating subject to me but apparently not enough of one for the author, especially with a lack of fancy and speculation on Ellis's part. Perhaps there isn't enough known about the giant squid to fill a book. The book seems like a long, dutiful graduate paper - exhaustive and heavily referenced (40 pages!) - in short, too much to the point."
4,"""I said tentacles, not...""","A well done and impassioned piece of pop science. Upon completing this you can honestly claim to know more about the giant squid than your friends. There is something of a problem with the book in that, so little is known about Archeteuthis, it's tough to fill a book with something more than marine biology. This is evident in the ""naming of the squid"" chapter and the exceedingly dull chapter on giant squid models.However, the subject matter and transparent excitement of the author win out. You know Ellis admires this beast, he shows it, but it does not detract from the science. Very worthwhile."
3,interesting book considering how little is really known about Architeuthis,"I have been intrigued for many years by the giant squid. (I love calamari and I make a marinated squid dish that is truly terrific.) So, when I read this book and realized how little marine biologists really know about the giant squid (and even little squids it seems), I was a bit disappointed. I was also disappointed to learn that they rarely if ever show up in the northwest waters of the U.S. The book is about as well written as it could be about a subject of which so little is known. But at least I now know as much about the creature as anyone else. Great cocktail conversation, eh?!?"
4,georgia descendants,"This is a great research tool if you are a NeSmith, especially from georgia. I gave the book to my father for his 64th birthday.There was a picture in there of his grandparents, that have been long gone.The system used for generation to generation is a little confusing.The stories and pictures through out the book were great,not just birth and death dates like most genealogy research."
1,Dissapointing,"I was dissapointed with the quality of this book. It sits on my shelf only 3 chapters read. There is more loud-writing than persuasive argument in this book and unfortunately it reinforces the stereo-type of the militant hand-waving feminist (note this reader was not impressed with ""Whose science"" either). Not recommended for philosophers (incidentally, Harding edited and wrote a very good introduction for an excellent philosophical book on the Duhem-Quine Thesis, ""Can Theories be Refuted?"")."
1,A study in the non sequitur.,"Harding digs up all matter of bizarre ""evidence"" to support her thesis that science is radically sexist. Unfortunately, none of the arguments she makes have anything remotely close to validity, never mind soundness. This book does a great disservice to people in general and women in specific by enthroning sloppy thinking, calling it ""feminine""."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"After I read ""Blinded"" by Thrasher I was really excited to read more of his work. He definitley has a different style of writing. I was not impressed with ""admission"" or ""Sky Blue"", so when I purchased Gun Lake I really wanted to like and enjoy this book. But, alas after wading through the first half of this book and the myriad characters which seemed to go back and forth without any ryme or reason i put it down and had no interest in finishing it. The plot is confusing and for me anyway if I don't get a least a clue of what the story is half way through a book I lose interest. I'm sure others will like this book, but for me, too many characters, too confusing and just not a good read."
5,Gun Lake was so Suspenseful!,"I absolutely LOVED Gun Lake, it was adventurous, suspenseful and amazing. Following the lives of everyday people only to collide with gun toting prison escapees, will leave you never wanting to put this book down! You will love the excitement this book entails as you follow along with Travis Thrashers Gun Lake~A Thrill Ride....Guaranteed! Enjoy!"
4,Great Art Kit,"Finally, I've found the perfect art kit. Purchased this for my then 5 year old nephew who loves to draw. He still uses this set and he's 8 now! The assortment of items is excellent, markers, colored pencils, watercolor pencils, sharpener, eraser, clay, oil pastels, etc. We too had problems as mentioned by the other reviewer w/ the hinges on the case. The case looks great but doesn't hold up. For the price, you get a lot but they should knock off a few bucks if they can't build a decent carrying case. Overall, we're all happy w/ the purchase. A great kit for any budding artist who's beyond crayons!"
4,A Little Something For Everyone,"Tony Humphries produces an impressive laidback set with a selection of tracks that can probably satisfy most electronica fans. No doubt a ""house"" album, Fabric 04 teeters on the edge of being almost loungey in its tempo. Probably not the greatest of sets to dance away your pent up energy on a friday or saturday night, but definitely worth a spin in the CD player for more sedated moods.Humphries mixing skills are worth the listen alone, but it's this transition in mood that occurs halfway through the tracks at ""Late Night"" by Floppy Sounds and ""I Cant (You Know)"" by Dun Taylor that truely make this a better than average house set. Disappointingly, Humphries leaves this very cool sound for more lovie-dovie lyrical house with the next three tracks. A groove killer for me.Overall, a good set, good tracks, great mixing, but too many love theme vocal house tracks for my tastes. 4/5 stars."
5,Wham! is slammin' and jammin',"I first heard this when I was a teenager and being a fan of Wham! naturally wanted to buy it. I had been looking for this for years. Of course back then it was on VHS, so I am glad that I waited for technology to evolve =) and having the DVD is WAAAAAAY better. My Mom even listens and watches it from time to time. It's great. However, there are some videos that I wish were on there, but I like the ones that are included just fine."
4,young guns video does exist,"the young guns video does exist. I have downloaded it on kazaa, and it is not a live video. It has a story and is a real music video. its just a shame its not on this collection."
3,old school wham videos like young guns,"FYI... there is an older video collection from Wham out there... ""Wham the video""... it has the older stuff like wham rap, young guns, etc...it ends with careless whisper i believe- freedom isn't even on it, although it is played over the end credits. Try to hunt it down... I have it on VHS from 1985!"
2,Where's the rest of the best?,"I'll get straight to the point... no ""Bad Boys"", no ""Young Guns (Go For It)"", no ""Careless Whisper"", no ""A Different Corner"". I am quite cheesed off. I realise that ""Careless Whisper"" and ""A Different Corner"" are technically solo hits for George but they ARE on Wham! albums. As a matter of fact, ""Careless Whisper"" was released as Wham! (featuring George Michael). Please don't get me wrong; I love George Michael and I love Wham! but I just wish that there was more substance to this DVD compilation. I would love to have a commentary by George AND Andrew (they still talk, you know) and a making of some of the videos, maybe ""Blue - Live In China"" or ANYTHING live. Yes, I realise that the ""Everything She Wants"" video is ""live"" but it is just the studio version dubbed over a live video segment. Unfortunately, this is what happens when Columbia/Sony Records releases a Wham! DVD without George Michael's input. Well, that's all for now. Ciaoooooooooooooooooooooo!"
4,Pleasant surprise,"It was by accident that I found out ""The Best of Wham!"" would be released in DVD. Being a huge fan since the beginning, I didn't hesitate to buy the DVD, and I was hoping that this DVD would includes something exciting... It's great to be able to enjoy Wham! videos with DVD quality. This DVD includes all Wham! video except one, Bad Boys. Though they never made Young Guns video, I have seen the performance of the song on the british program, Top of the Pops, and I was really, really hoping to see the footage of the appearance on this DVD. I would've liked to see a little extra effort on this production to make this DVD ""Best of"" collection, truly the ultimate best. Yet, this is a great buy for any Wham!/George Michael fan, and I have absolutely no regrets. The short 4 years of Wham! are packed in this DVD."
4,Explore some unknown gems.,"If you're looking for an album of well-written but rarely heard American orchestral music, this is the disc for you. The recording is not without its flaws: the editing is sometimes less than professional, and conductor Julius Williams often seems more intent on getting the notes right than on bringing out the romanticism in the music. But the selection represents some of the best of the unknown, from Lee McQuillan's lyrical violin romanza to Beth Denisch's raucous fanfare to Jack Jarrett's beautifully conceived symphony (the only truly neo-Romantic piece on the CD). The highlight of the album is the Symphony for Chamber Ensemble by Leroy Southers, a sadly neglected composer whose music is in the style and of the caliber of mid-century American greats such as William Schuman and Roy Harris. This is one of the all-too-rare recordings of his music, and the second movement---brilliantly constructed and achingly moving---is by itself worth the price of the CD."
2,3 Step Designer Step Stool,"Nice Looking, but not easy to move. The bar at the top isn't smooth and it hurts if you try to move the stool with one hand. Also, it arrived with the top plastic piece broken on one side. Disappointed. Not worth the trouble of returning."
2,Too heavy and unwieldy,"I have ceiling-high kitchen cupboards and ordered this step stool to use in reaching the upper shelves. However, I should have paid more attention to the listed weight, as it's very heavy and oversized for a ""step stool."" My old folding step stool fit easily between the washer and dryer, or in the pantry, but this thing is huge and even though I have a large kitchen, pantry, and laundry room, I could not find a place where it could be stored. Amazon is wonderful to deal with, and I'm returning it for a smaller (and lighter) model. Contrary to another review, though, mine arrived very well packed in a HUGE box."
2,Wow- this thing is heavy!!,"this step stool looks great on the web.... I had a costco branded one that fell apart literally-- so Iiked that this one was load rated and seems to look nice enough. Unfortunately, when it arrived (it took a month BTW) it was so heavy that my wife and my son could not reasonably lift it and move it around safely.... step stools are presumably for people on the small side to reach stuff that is on the high side, so a product made from a light weight material is called for, not so for this one. I order 95% of my ""stuff"" from Amazon/ web but this is the kind of thing one should go to a retail store for I think..."
3,Sturdy Enough But Won't Stay Closed,"I certainly like the sturdiness of this step stool. However, the rail is useful only has something to add to the sturdiness of the product - not something I would hold onto going up and down.The one thing that needs to change - there is no hook or anything to keep the step stool closed for storage."
4,a very good sturdy choice,"This step stool is very acceptable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had to get used to it- when you step down the steps are not as staggered as you might expect. However, it is very stable and locks in place."
4,Not what I was expecting from Denise... in a GREAT way!,"I have a ton of fitness videos, and picked this one up on a whim. I am SO glad I did! I was surprised at how efficient the entire program was.. it was fast moving, but I felt like my entire body was worked, and worked well. I almost gave up on Denise after her Burn Fat Fast video, which was frustrating in that it didn't provide a high intensity workout.I completed the entire program tonight, and it was FUN and not in a dancy, breezy way - but in a way that moved along without getting boring.Beginners will definitely get frustrated with this because it IS Denise, and her cueing is atrocious.. BUT if you exercise often, and are familar with a variety of moves you will catch on quickly. I highly recommend this dvd for exercisers wanting to throw in some great variety (which there is a TON in this video) I am now a happy (boot)camper!"
3,"Good, but needs more upper body toning","This dvd is 20 min cardio, 20 min toning, 10 min stretch. The cardio is good, but they put the abs at the end of it. I wish it was in the toning section. The toning is mostly squats/lunges with some weights. They need more arm exercises. I add my own back/chest ones at the end of the workout. Otherwise, I'd have given it a 4. The Personal Training dvd is much better. Get that instead of this one if you dont already have it."
4,MUCH more than I expected from a DVD!,"First things first: I'm in good shape. I run about 5 days a week (4-5 miles) and do strength training. This DVD kicked my butt the first time I did it, partly because I wasn't expecting such a good workout! It's a GREAT lower body workout. Expect a LOT of squats! It also does a good job working your core, and of course, it's great cardio. It doesn't, however, offer much for the upper body. You'll have to do that seperately. It's not an easy video, but it's not boring, either. Great for rainy days that you don't want to turn into off days, and it beats the treadmill!"
2,Not my ideal...,"I had high hopes for this video. Some have complained of Denise Austin's cartoony voice, but I found it to be somewhat encouraging. Her fitness moves are really good if you're looking for something to transition beyond beginner level. She incorporates a lot of yoga moves into the workout (ex: downward facing dog), so it allowed me to stretch and exercise at the same time. However, I was looking for something really intense, but this is at best intermediate level with slow moves. I'll continue looking, but for now I'll stick with Billy Blanks and Cathe Friederich videos."
3,too annoying to watch frequently,"As far as a workout, this was pretty good -- able to get the heart rate up and work up a bit of a sweat in 20 minute chunks, which was what I was looking for.But Denise drives me nuts. I couldn't take the constant chattering and coddling about what a ""champion we are"" as we ""train like an ath-e-lite"" while we ""think about how good we'll look in a bathingsuit"" because I'm ""a fat burning machine!"" If it wasn't constant, or if it was in a different tone of voice, I think I could live with it. Her form was pretty good, though one of her minions was wearing high-heeled sneakers which really rubs me the wrong way.When I ordered the dvd, I thought I'd be able to put up with it, but now my next step is trying to mute the volume for the dvd so I don't throw my TV out the window."
2,not so good,"I CAN SEE THAT BEGINNERS WOULD BE CHALLENGED, AND AT MY LEVEL THE WORKOUT WAS OK... BUT I COULDN'T NOT TOLERATE HER VOICE/DIRECTION & TALK ABOUT A DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS!!!! IF YOU WORK OUT REGULARLY, YOU COULD DO YOUR OWN COUNT, OTHERWISE, GOOD LUCK!THIS ONE WILL COLLECT DUST IN THE NEAR FUTURE, UNLESS I DO IT ENOUGH TO TURN THE VOLUME OFF & FOLLOW THE LIP-SINKING!!!"
2,Denise does not keep to the beat and her cueing is bad!,"The workout could be good if she would only cue correctly, sometimes she looks lost. This is not good for beginners as it's too hard to follow.I wish I had chosen a different DVD."
2,Just okay,"If this just came on my TV and I hadn't stuck it in myself, I'd seriously think this was a comedy skit-a workout parody. She bounces around like a cheerleader and is laughably over the top with her expressions. It's seriously like someone let the air out of a balloon and it's going all around the room out of control and making funny weird noises. There doesn't seem to be a real focus to the workout, just to keep randomly moving.The only good thing I can say is I did sweat a little and there is variety. It's not one I'd buy over again."
5,Good choice to build a strong body!,"Since the first time I used this video, I felt impressed with Austin's enthusiasm to urge the audiences to keep doing it strongly and effectively!The videos are well divided into short parts and you can select or order what parts you're going to do first or later.I've felt my bodies get some changes in short time. If you're looking for a video to build your body up, I recommend Denise Austin: Boot Camp. You'll never be disappointed for sure."
5,Denise keeps getting better!,"I have a few of Denises workouts and I think this one is one of my favorites. It is a great workout that lets you feel you really did something terrific for your self. She is encouraging and does the work along with you like all my favorite instructors. Best of all, the 2 twenty minute sets for any level, you just up or lower your own intensity level. i am so happy that so many great instructors are making workouts for those of us short on time but wanting to have it all!"
2,Not my favorite,"I'm a fan on Denise, but this video didn't do it for me. The weight training wasn't very difficult, but the cardio did get my heart rate going. The cues were also terrible, her staff couldn't always follow her. The staff is also a little annoying (especially the guys) because they have over exagerated expressions - you can tell it's fake.I'd recommened Denise's hit the spot pilates before this video - that's my favorite."
4,Enjoy this DVD,"I have several of her exercise DVD's .... This is not my favorite but I do enjoy it. It's very cardio-intensive, it certainly works up a sweat, but I don't feel like I get enough ab and arm workout from it. I will do the cardio section along with my Shrink Your Female Fat Zone DVD but if I do this whole DVD then I add an ab and arm workout from another DVD. But, am glad I purchased this DVD."
3,fairly good,"Denise always strikes me as being more bubbles than soap, her ""Im proud of you"" irritates me, she uters too many unnecessary words but the workouts are fairly good even if short, to get any substance one has to do both.Not in the karen voigt, kathy smith, gilad range at all."
2,Annoying,"I imagine the DVD would do as it promises and get a person in shape but I can't get past Denise's whisper voice... I thought the first time I played it I was just in a bad mood. But the second time wasn't any better. I've decided to give the tape away because her voice annoys me so bad. It was like she was talking to children and it made me want scream - use your ""big person"" voice."
2,Not for me,The workout itself is not too bad. Definately works up a sweat and is a pretty hard workout. I hate it so much because Denise is over the top annoying. I can't stand her voice or her comments. If you put the video on mute its not too bad. I guess it depends what your looking for.
2,"Good cardio, weak strength workout.","Workout was ok- I was looking for a good cardio & stength mix, but feel this workout was definitely more cardio. Transitions between exercises were rushed and confusing and Denise's cues were very sloppy. Strength exercises were very fast and I found myself going at my own pace so I did not compromise proper form. Denise is a little annoying and far from a ""Drill Sergeant"" and I would probably put the tv on mute if I ever use this DVD again."
4,Let me just say,If you don't like denise austin don't order her dvds then bash her in the reviews - denise is peppy and happy shouting out encouragement - yes she's bad at cueing but its not really that big a deal just deal with it - the video is intense it kicks my butt sometimes i can't even finish it but you get a good workout and its 20 minutes out of your life - you can do it
3,It's okay.,"This DVD is okay. I like the (2) 20 minutes workouts, but something is missing. I don't feel like I worked out as hard as I could have. But I'll still do it. I agree w/ another reveiwer that there is a little too much jumping."
5,I lost 25 pounds,Just follow her instructions and enjoy; I couldn't believe it until I lost 25 pounds. This is great!!!! I recomend it to every body specially if you are in your 30's.
3,Descent Workout,"The 2 workouts are descent workouts & I do feel good after each session, the stretch is great (especially after the squats & lunges). But I dont like kickboxing & there are a lot of kicks in each section. I feel very rushed through the ab sections & like that got thrown in as an after thought. The strength section has similar moves as her Burn Fat Fast - Cardio Sculpt workout but w/a slight difference. Overall it is a descent quick workout."
4,Sweat!,"You will sweat sweat sweat! But if you live on the second floor of a building like I do, you might not want to do this exercise and tee off your neighbors. It's a lot of bouncing, and a lot of things that you need...rope, weights, mat, etc. While I do feel the burn, I think that maybe there are better ways to shake a few pounds."
3,Good Sweat!,I've been working out for the last 4 months after 2-3 years of inactivity. I am was around 100 pounds overweight when I started excercising and eating better. Since then I've lost 30 pounds. I bought this workout DVD and was not disappointed! It's probably a little too much for those who are just starting out (like I was 4 months ago!)and not enough for those hard-core extreme exercisers. It's just right for where I am right now. I like Denise's bubbly personality but sometimes her cues and/or rhythm are off. This is a faster paced workout. Sometimes I do one section or both and then always the stretch. It does help me get a good sweat!
2,Lacks a polished presentation!,"This is my first Denise Austin workout video and I will never buy another one!I'd expected someone as established as Denise would take the time to properly teach the routine to her workout crew and be sure they've practiced enough times before making this into a DVD and charging money for it. Everyone continuously messes up their moves which drives me absolutely nuts. Possibly I'm too picky, but regardless of how good of a workout this is, the misteps of the people distracts me from getting a decent workout."
2,too bad,"this is the worst denise austin dvd to date. she truly acts like a confused overexhuberant cheerleeder. i have always been able to tune her out in the past but her lack of instruction makes it impossible. sometimes she tells you, sometimes she doesn't. both of the workouts on this leave a lot to be desired. as does the stretch. not sure this would be recommended for beginners as she bounces from one move to the other without warning and haphazardly, but experienced would be bored with this very quickly. and just a quick remark, when you think of boot camp what do you think of???? um duh!!! lots of running, jumping jacks... high impact moves. that and absolutely no where on the dvd does it say low impact. try the personal training system using the low intensity aerobics section."
3,Stop Talking Please!!,"This is my first experience with Denise Austin and it will probably be my last. Although the workout itself is pretty good, (I was sore afterward) she is so annoying I almost can't overlook it. She is a parody of herself! It's hard to follow at times but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it after a few tries. That is if I can handle her again..."
4,Great Video!,This video is great if your looking for some good cardio. You do need to have good balance for some moves. She moves right along through it (like Denise does) but its pretty easy to follow. I am very happy with this video.
4,Good Workout,The workouts on this video are pretty intense although only they are only 20 minutes each. Austin can sometimes seem a little strange but she gives a good workout!
2,annoying and poor cues,"I don't care for this workout. I find Denise's cuing inadequate, her stagey personality annoying, and the workout poorly paced. There is no attention to form so it would be a terrible tape for beginners. Experienced exercisers will handle the rapid transitions because they already know proper form. Others will strain to follow along."
3,"Denise Austen, Boot Camp Total Body Blast","I must say that I'm a bit disappointed. Actually, I expected more, considering that title. The workout presented by Denise Austin is simply not challenging enough. After going through both routines I wasn't in the least exhausted. This DVD may be suitable for a complete beginner, but for an experienced exerciser there are not enough challenging moves such as many repetitions of pushups of different kinds. From a DVD called Boot Camp I would have expected that. Moreover, I would have preferred one longer workout to two short ones."
4,great workout,I just tried the bootcamp workout and did all 3 sections. The cardio section really got my heartrate up and that was great. The second section was a mix of cardio and strengh. I would have liked a bit more strength exercises but I am just going to use heavier weights to get more from it. The flexability section was a great way to finish it off. I really enjoy her upbeat attitude.
5,One Of Denise's Best!,"This workout dvd will really get your metabolism revved and your heart pumping. The high intensity intervals are short but they are challenging --right from the beginning. I always think...Oh Denise Austin, this is going to be so easy...well this isn't what I would call easy. In fact it left me breathless. Denise, as always, is fun and motivating and if you incorporate this workout into your routine, you will see results. This is a really good workout -- even for an advanced exerciser like me!"
1,Straight from SNL,"Oh My God! I could not keep a straight face during this workout video. Denise Austin has her eyes open as wide as possible, and it sounds like she's talking to a bunch of sesame streeters. She should really consider developing an exercise program for children. I could not take her seriously. She sporadically jumps from move to move and by the time you start doing the correct move, she jumps to the next. I'm all for high intensity, but let me know what the hell to do before you go balls to the wall. The only plus is the 10min stretching section."
2,Denise just throws it together,"Like other reviewers said, Denise has been doing this for so long and yet she is so inadequate. The impact is definitely much higher in this workout (which is rare), than in most of her other DVDs that are typically extremely non-challenging, but the whole routine feels thrown together, made up as you go. There are NEVER enough reps, sides are not worked evenly and if I hear, 'train like an athlete' or 'bootaful' one more time I have to throw up. I normally get pumped up with high-impact cardio, but this workout is extremely non-motivating even though I was sweating pretty good. She talks non-stop in a very annoying manner and the music is blah. I felt very unsatisfied afterwards and I'm so done trying her workouts. Denise is seriously far below the standard of today's instructors."
4,"Great Workout for younger, stronger audience","I recently purchased this work out DVD but find it too difficult for me. It is a great workout and I'd recommend it for the younger and stronger audience. I would like to see something similar for the Senior audience.Thanks,Joyce"
3,Challenging! Great flexibility training.,"Only 20 minutes per session, each boot camp session is challenging! I especially like the strength training sequences. Fast & fun. The flexibility training at the end is a must do! Good for all levels because you can monitor your pace."
1,Hated it,"I hated this workout. I do a rotation of workout videos that include Power Yoga a la Rodney Yee, Brian Kest, and Shiva Rea plus Jillian Michaels Power Shred when I am short on time. The Jillian workout is similar in concept to the Denise Austin one, but she just blows Denise away with superior organization, cues and motivation. I couldn't believe I wasted my money or time on this DVD and donated it to Goodwill after doing it only once."
2,Boot Camp Cardio feels more like Sculpting without weights,Thankfully I only borrowed this from the library. I tried the Cardio portion of the workout but it's more like fast sculpting without weights. Needed a cardio workout for rest days between toning not more toning.
2,Annoying!,"Wow, the workout is great but unfortunately Denise talks the entire time. It's almost as though she doesn't even breath in between words. And annoying stuff like ""come on you can do it"", ""your great"", ""ok"" and she explains every single move her body makes even if it's lifting an arm. And I mean every move. And just fills the void with whatever comes to mind. And her eyes are huge and she just looks crazy.I had to mute it after 5 mintues. But if I can put that aside, the work out is good. I probably won't do it again though. Maybe someone else would love her and not be annoyed though."
4,German lessons,"I bought this without realizing I needed a voice input to fully use the lessons. Other than that, the lessons are good."
5,Easy to follow,"This is the bare bones, no fluff, respiratory equipment guide. Follows clinical check-offs and tells you exactly what you NEED to know. Well worth the envestment for any student or RT."
4,Just what I needed.,Needed a competency check off for the Bird VIP and it was exactly what I needed.
5,WAY OUT THERE!!!,"Basicly, these japanese black metal guys took every kind of music that you can imagine (yes, everything...grunge, classic rock, electronica, industrial, gothic, punk, country, drone, metal, jazz, reggae, swing, cabaret, noise) and made one extremly weird album. It's hard not to like this album, allthough I don't think other bands should get this carried away...but for the sake of this kamakazi blend finnally being done...than it certainly should come from the japanese. Sigh has accomplished the ultimate weirdness. If you need something that is just way, way, way out there....this is it."
5,Imaginary Fantastic,"Absolutely genious. That guy Mirai (the man behind the band) is fantastic and he sure knows how to throw us in some psicadelic dream with his latest album. The melodies in this album are so simple, so NWOBHV, that it is not possible to be absorbed by such sonic richness, always discovering a new sound, a new layer every time you hear it. That's what make a brilliant album, I think, and this for sure is one."
2,Doesn't work on dvd players,I bought this because I lost my cord to my portable dvd player which needed an aux on one side and a 3 rca on the other. So I ordered this and it doesn't work. Not sure why. Fortunately it was cheap so I didn't waste a lot of money.
1,Wired incorrectly,"Could not get this to work with my portable DVD player. Pulled the 3.5mm plug out slightly and the audio worked. I assumed that some wires within the cable were incorrectly connected or reversed. 3.5mm plug has 4 contact points, which makes sense as the inputs are video, L-audio, R-audio and common ground. Tried another identical RCA A/V to 3.5mm cable and it worked fine. Good thing I only paid $2.50 for this piece of garbage."
1,didn't work at all with my galaxy S!,"I did whatever the other reviewers suggested, but I was able only to get sound out of my tv. No image. Very disappointing!"
1,audio/video cable,"Cord appears t be of good quality in construction. However, the color-coded plugs are not correct.....the yellow (normally for video) is actually one of the speaker jacks, and the red is for video. This reflects poor quality control...."
1,No Stars if I could,I READ OTHER REVIEWS OF SAMSUNG CAPTIVATE USERS ON AT&T SAYING THIS CORD WORKED. NOPE I WASN'T SUCCESSFUL AT ALL ON EITHER TV IN MY HOUSE NO MY FACTORY DVD PLAYER IN MY JEEP. I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A HIT OR MISS ISSUE EITHER. I STARTED NOT TO BUY IT DUE TO BEING ONLY $3+. NOW I STILL HAVE TO PURCHASE AN EVEN HIGHER PRICED CABLE NOW TO SEE IF IT'LL WORK.....NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS AT ALL...
2,Review on 3 RCA AV Camcoder Video Cable,"I am happy with the delivery service, however, the product was of inferior quality and defective. On first test, the audio cable was good but the video cable had interferences and didin't work.6FT 3.5 mm to 3 RCA AV Camcorder Video Cable Sony JVC 6"
1,Piece of JUNK!!,"The price should have alerted me. This thing is a piece of junk!! The spacing of the contacts on the 1/8"" plug is not standard. Very poor or non-existant quality control. Don't waste your time or money! I can't believe that Amazon continues to do busines with these clowns."
1,Worthless ZERO STARs should be an option,Ordered this item as a replacement for my lost JVC everio cable. Item did not work! plugged it in to my tv and all i got was a scrambled picture like the old porn channels. Called JVC costumer support to see maybe if i didnt have a setting correct on my unit itself. They said no that was not the case. tried to use the item on 3 different tv's and a 2nd camcorder. Paid 3 bucks to learn a life lesson you get what you pay for. Not worth the trouble to return.
5,FANTASTIC,I am extremely thrilled with the camcorder video and audio cord...........since I hadn't had the cord we werent able to watch our many videos and now that is no longer a problem.........thanks for the quick service.
1,Does not work for Roku 2,"Despite the fact that an Amazon search for ""Roku 2 AV Cable"" leads you to this product, it does not work for Roku 2. I should have been warned off by all the reviews that say it doesn't work for other products, but I (foolishly) trusted Amazon's search results.And, like others, it's not worth my time to return it for a $2.36 item. Maybe I'll get out a soldering iron and fix it, or maybe I'll order one straight from Roku for $10. Sigh.For those interested, if you look at the 3.5mm plug side from the tip to the base, this cable goes like this: White (left audio), Yellow (video), Ground (common), Red (right audio).A Roku 2 AV cable goes like this form the tip to the base: White (left audio), Red (right audio), Yellow (video), Ground (common).The Roku's wiring seems more logical, so I suspect this cable is for something unusual, though I can't say. In any case, if you're getting this for your Roku box, unless you like the smell of solder, skip it."
4,works great,"exactly as advertised, video transfer quality is good. might could have been a bit longer, but does the job well."
4,works for samsung vibrant just use red for video,this cable works good you just have to use red for video instead of yellow.
1,not for Roku,The cable I received would not work on the Roku device I purchased. I ended up finding on ebay for about $6 - $8 that did work. Save your money and get that one.
4,VIdeo out for Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S),"Simply plugged this in to my Samsung Captivate, enabled video out, and I had picture/sound from my phone on my tv. Not much more to say, worked as expected.As others have said, I had to swap the red and yellow cables, so red for video and yellow for a sound channel. I don't think this is the cable's fault, I imagine Samsung didn't follow the standard for this cable type."
5,works great,"The cables seem to work as advertised. I don't have occasion to use it very often, but it works ok."
5,Great !,"I was really happy with the part I needed, working as it should be. The Price? Oh, you can't imagine ! Thanks much !!"
4,it works not perfectly but it works......,"i bought this item because i needed to connect my wd tv live to a regular tv that doesn't have a hdmi connection, when i tried it the first time it didn't work. there was no signal on my tv, so you don't have plug the cable in the same order of the colors. it goes like this:3 RCA / tvwhite / yellowred / redyellow / white"
3,Good product -not compatible.,"Good product -not compatible.with the ROKU box which uses a similar cable, but different connection scheme.Not the seller's fault, Just different cable."
4,Great company,"I order on a Monday got it Wednesday. There was a problem with this cable sent an email heard back in a day. They sent a new cable the next day received it 2-3 days later works great.....They stand behind There products like no other company I've bought from..I will differentially be spreading good word about your company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I also bought other cables (2-Audio, a splitter, 2-3.5mm adapters) all work great."
3,Didn't work.,"The cable was bad on my portable Panasonic DVD player. I bought this to replace it. This one was way worse so I thought the video out was bad on the player. Foolish me! I just checked this cable with our brand new player and this cable doesn't work at all. Argh!Edit - 4/6/12It does work. However, the colors are all wrong. A bit of a pain but does work."
5,Perfect,Needed this 3.5mm AV cable for an old camcorder. Does what it's supposed to without any problems.
2,cord did not work,"JVC cord for my camcorder did not work, when I sent email got reply that I would get a refund, but didn't happen. I was impressed at first with the quick mailout, but unfortunately didn't work."
1,Non-standard cables,These cables look like regular AV cables but are wired differently and do not work with conventional gear like JVC a nd Panasonic camcorders.
5,Great cable for Samsung Vibrant,"I purchased this cable for use with my Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant phone to connect my phone to my tv. It works very well as long as it is hooked up correctly. It is necessary to plug the yellow connector into the red plug and the red connector into the yellow plug. Upon plugging it in and enabling ""tv out"" in the ""display"" setting on my phone, my phone became visible on my tv. I can watch Netflix, check email, text,view pictures, play music, etc all via my tv when it is connected to my phone. I don't know how often I will use the cable, but I really like the added functionality it gives my phone."
5,What a great price!,"I couldn't believe the price of this cable with free shipping to boot. It took about 4 days to arrive, and the postage sticker on the bubble envelope said it cost 80 cents for them to ship it. WIth only 74 cents left after the shipping cost, I can't believe they can sell it this cheap.I ordered this as a replacement for the AV cable on my Viewsonic NexTV box. The wiring on my player was proprietary, so I had to modify the cable to work correctly. It was cheap enough that I wasn't afraid to ruin it. Now my $135 media player is useful again."
1,Pathetic,I thought it was a standard 3.5mm to RCA cable.May be I am wrongI swapped colors in all permutations but it still did not work...a total waste of 4 dollars.Btw it did not work with my Cowon A3.
3,puzzling but functional,"Upon receiving this, I assumed it was DOA. I was just planning on using it to run audio from my mp3 player or laptop to the aux. inputs on my receiver, and plugging this in, I heard only a single channel.I filled out the digital paperwork to return it to Amazon--more as a way of blowing off steam, it would barely be worth the effort to get my $3 back. A family member suggested I test the voltage, and let me use his meter, which revealed that all three rca outs were connected to a length of the 3.5mm jack, they just correlated to the wrong color coding. I never would have though to try plugging the yellow plug into the audio input, but that's what got it working for me.The cable works fine in the end, but wasted a whole lot of my time trying to figure out a manufacturing mistake, thus it gets a poor rating."
3,Works great but Red and Yellow are switched,"I use this cord to plug my laptop into my external speaker system. Only one side was working and I couldn't figure out why. As the other reviews mentioned, the red and yellow are switched. Plug the yellow cord into the red socket and the red socket into the yellow cord. Once I did this, my issue was resolved."
4,Works fine,This was purchased to connect my Mini-DV Camera to my tv/dvd recorder/ VCR. It works fine. The cable is of standard construction. It does what it is supposed to do. Worth the couple bucks I spent on it.
5,camcorder video cable,"A great cable cord at a great price. I like the ""sideways"" jack because it is not as easy for young fingers to crimp the chord. Shipping was quick and everything was exactly as expected."
1,HORRIBLE,Got my cable in the mail and it doesn't work called in and i got stuck in a loop of computer responses not worth my time
1,3.5 4 pole pin-out not correct for Roku.,"As sighted in previous reviews, this cable is ab-normal compared to cables with the same connectors. The sleeve for this cable is the 3rd RCA's center and the next conductor on the 3.5mm 4 pole plug is the sleeve for the 3 RCA connectors. In the electronics world this would be frowned upon, but in the world of consumer electronics it's apparently acceptable.However, my Roku and, perhaps many other devices the sleeve of the 3.5mm 4 pole plug needs to be the sleeve for the 3 RCA connectors. A 3.5mm 4 pole plug's sleeve is the one closest to the plastic part of the jack. You can identify that this conductor is indeed the sleeve because it has a lip that comes into contact with the front of the jack, electrically sealing the connection from outside interference. In some cases the front part of the jack can also be part of the device's chassis or electrically connected to it.Can anyone confirm this using something authoritative like a black-box catalog?"
3,Does NOT work with captivate,The Samsung captivate uses a different grounding scheme than is used with this cable. If you try to plug it in you will get a bar across the screen but will not be able to see.
1,THROW THE DICE... hope you get a working one.,"From everything I've read here and my own purchase, I can honestly say that you MIGHT get a working cable, you might not. I was one of the unlucky ones whose cable did NOT work. And in case you're wondering if it's a technical issue, it doesn't work on my camcorder or anything else either for that matter.I HAVE a working cable that works on my camcorder AND my Samsung phone now just fine. YES, the Captivate is wired weird so you have to reverse RED & YELLOW from a standard cable... but I guess that's how Samsung sells a ""special"" cable (where they've already painted the colors differently for you, how nice).Seriously, go to Radio Shack and buy one of these you KNOW will work. This one came from China (which I didn't know until after I bought) so I definitely wouldn't gamble!"
1,Nope,"Bought this with the intent of being able to bring an xbox around with me in the car for road trips, thought I could use it as an AV IN for my portable dvd player from my Xbox, plugged it all in, nothin' but static. Sending back soon."
1,SCAM! DO NOT BUY!,Doesnt work at all. all u'll get is a scrambled picture (if ur lucky). I've tried ALL COMBINATIONS and i've NEVER got the sound to work ONCE! They're just making money off of shipping and the price is so low that they figure no one would go through the hassle of returning it. PURE SCAM! DO NOT BUY!!!
3,"Fine for camcorder, not Epic 4G","I bought this cable because I thought it would work for a video out for my Samsung Epic 4G. Turns out it doesn't. I should have investigated better on the settings of my phone first, but I saw reviews that said it would work (not on this site). Epic 4G has not setting for TV-Out like other Galaxy S devices do.On the bright side, it works fine for my JVC HM100. Soooo.. I guess it wasn't a total waste of money. And it was way cheaper than the Radio Shack cable I bought last time."
1,Inferior product...DOES NOT WORK WITH SAMSUNG VIBRANT!!!,I bought this cable based on reading some reviews stating that they work with the tv out feature for my samsung vibrant phone...not the case!!! I tried everything including changing the connections for video input and such. It simply does not work!!! Beware!!!I can't imagine this being an isolated case as others have the same experience.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
5,Wonderful...,This product works great. Insert red in Yellow slot in TV or other devices. It works great....Now am able to view my mobile contents in TV (Youtube too...) wow.....
5,works great for sony camcorder,"don't have any complaints, they work well with my sony camcorder. loaned the cords out and never got them back and these replacement cords work great."
4,Allows me to plug up my captivate to my TV with success.,"Pros: Does its job and lets me get TV-out from my Samsung Captivate.Cons: With my cable the red and the yellow needed to be swapped when plugging in. Still works fine though.For this price, I don't mind having to swap a color for another when plugging in to a tv."
3,Wrong cable for hero video camera,"My fault thinking I could save a buck.Need a 2.5 mm plug not this 3.5 plug.Too many details when buying all the bits and pieces, just buy the damn cable from Go Pro.Cable seems ok,again my fault not seeing the size difference."
1,Weel Cheap is as CHEAP is,"Well I bought this cable for my wifes My Touch. First words out of her mouth, ""is this cable suposed to be this loose"". She tried every what which way of colors and still no such luck on getting a picture on the TV. After some trial and error and I mean ERROR the cable accessed her phones system making random calls and acting like a mouse gone amuck inside her phone. I dont recomend this cable. The seller is o k just not the product."
1,Did NOT Work with my T-Mobile Samsung Vibrant,"I bought this to use video out on my samsung vibrant. I tried all combinations of plugging it in. Even with the red and yellow swapped, it still did not work. I only tried it on 1 tv, but I doubt I will fair better on a different one.I'm not sure if it's a US vibrant phone issue, but my vibrant is a US made phone. I've heard that this cable works fine with UK vibrants."
1,Unsatisfied,This item wasn't what I needed for my phone.It was the wrong type of cord an I needed something to connect from my device to my tv.
1,Did not work,"Product was DOA. No connectivity though the cable. It was cheap, but cheap doesn't cut it when it does not work."
5,Another cable,"Best invention since sliced bread. Really, what can you say about a cable? I bought it, it works, enuff said."
4,Fun . . . but must also buy the CD,Great Stuff ! ! !Kindergarten kids love the CD that goes with it. You need to also buy the CD.Teacher Power ! ! !
5,"Great Slide, Works As Advertised",This is a great slide and works as advertised. I used this slide to make a BOSS GT-10 patch for a song by Lynyrd Skynyrd titled Freebird. This slide served it's purpose for me. BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg: [...]
4,More smiles from Canada's famous gay couple!,"Again, Sean shows how the everyday life of a gay coupleis filled with its ups and downs and humour. Sean takes usthrough a wide range of situations including the infamous'gay bashing' series as well as dealing with issues suchas AIDS. At the end of this book, Sean gives us a littlenarrated story about 'The Steps' in front of the SecondCup at Church and Wellesley. A recommended purchase for diehard Doc & Raider fans!"
5,Excellent,A near complete and very readable coverage of Omar Khayyam's life and times. It covers his time and works while clearing misconceptions and shedding light on some of the reasons for Omar Khayyam's continued relevance. .
3,Smart Babies,I have always heard that classical music improves your child's I.Q. I liked the samples offered here. I hope I like the C.D. as well as I liked the samples! Kathie
2,Christmas Gift,Was very pleased with how quickly it arrived in the mail. Haven't opened it yet though. Got it for my 6 yr old son for Christmas. SUPER EXCITED! WIll give further review after he opens and uses it. Great packaging though.
5,Super hero costumes,My 3 year old LOVES these costumes. The capes are a little long for him yet but not to the point that he will trip on them. He loves the fact that he can choose who he's going to be each day. This was a great investment for our family.
4,"These are cute, but hard for my kids to put on by themselves","Finding a Robin costume is nearly impossible. My kids love all of these, but they can't get them on by themselves, as they tie in the back. Otherwise, they have been a huge hit."
4,"Favorite gift, but cheaply sewn","This was by far my son's favorite Christmas gift! He's been wearing at least one of these every single day for the last week.The shoulder seams is not ended well, so it is already starting to unravel on a couple of them. It is easy enough to fix, but still a little annoying."
5,Perfect dress up costumes for little boys,Bought this for my son last year and the costumes are still going strong. My son randomly wears them and enjoys being a superhero on occasion. These are perfect because they go over whatever the kid is already wearing. They now have some spots on them and Im not sure how to go about cleaning them without ruining them. Overall a good product though.
4,great gift!,"yes, the quality is not the best.... but this is a costume, what do you expect?It is a great gift, my nephews loved them. It has been 1 year and they are still playing with them... nothing has falling apart yet.definitely worth the purchase."
1,superhero costume set,These are poor quality half costume shirts that go over the boys like an apron and only on the front and top.
3,Great for role play but not as durable as one would hope,My 4 year old son loves to role play with his little pals in these costumes. He likes that the cape(s) are very long (ankle length). The nice thing for adults is that the costumes slide easily over their head so the children are able to change costumes themselves without any assistance. The bad thing is that they are not very durable and not machine washable. The tie that goes around waist have all ready come off after only 6 weeks and the hem around the neckline is beginning to unravel.
4,BOYSDELIGHT,"While I love the Costume Trio I was a bit surprised that it was only the top portion that was included in the box. Maybe I missed something in the descrption. I was under the impression that they were full costumes. I decided to keep it anyway. When I gave it to my 5 year old on his birthday he was a little confused as to why it was only the top half. It is much easier for him to get the costumes on and off himself when playing so that it one good thing. I thought that the price should be a little less expensive since it is only the top portion of the costumes (like in the picture on the box). Nevertheless, my son was delighted when he opened the box and overall, I would recommend this product."
3,Good value but not the best quality,"It is a good value to have 3 super hero dress up tabards (poncho-like outfits that require tying the front and back together)for this price. My kids really had fun with them. However, for those who want to use these tabards for Halloween customs, you will need to get color coordinated long sleeve t-shirts/thermal shirts and long pants to complete the outfit. The set comes with the Batman and Robin masks. However, the Batman mask flared out and did not fit my 3 year-old's face well. I ended up purchasing a separate black Batman mask which was a much better fit. The fabric is pretty flimsy but it is good enough for infrequent use."
2,myreviewing,The products are just pull-over sheet with prints. They are not a clothing.That is why they've pictured upper part only. Very cheap custom; we were embarrassed at the party. Only good thing is mask were well made.
4,Super Hero Fun,"I bought this as a gift for my friend's son, turning 4 years old. He loves to dress up in the batman costume, he had his father dress up as robin. They told me the quality was good. And he always ask to wear the costume to daycare...lol. I've seen the princess dresses for the girls. Its nice to know the boys have dress up fun too."
4,Our kids insisted on sleeping in their costumes,The kids had non stop fun with the smocks and masks. the additional arm and leg covers were useless and thrown away. The only problem we had the ties are not sewn on tightly and I had to re sew them back on. Besides that it is a great dressup toy.
5,Fun super hero set,"This super hero set is really fun. The costumes are more like bibs with capes than shirts. That is not what I was expecting but it is actually very cool because the kids can put them on and off right over whatever they are wearing. My 2.5 year old really likes them and so do the other boys and girls in the neighborhood (mostly 4 and 5 years old). On a side note, I am surprised how much the kids like Robin ... I wasn't sure they would even know who he was and/or if they would want to wear his costume. It turns out that Robin is maybe the highest request."
4,"dorky, but my kids love them","These are pretty dorky, not fancy, we probably wouldn't use them for halloween costumes. But they are PERFECT for everyday costume play. The fact that they're just open tunics is actually an advantage for free play, because the kids can easily put these on themselves rather than fancier costumes which are often difficult to get on and off and which definitely need mom or dad's assistance. My kids also love that each costume has a variety of accessories (arm bands, leg covers, etc.), which for some reason they really dig."
5,Very cute and fun.,Cute and fun! This costume set was great for my five year old son and his friends on his birthday.
3,"Son loves it, but don't know how long it will last","Thought this would be a great present for my 3.5 year old. How could you go wrong with 3 dress-up costumes in one package. But you get what you pay for. These costumes are just tunics (open/no seam on the sides) that go over the child's head and tie around the child's waist. The cape does hide the tie. The material does not seem very durable and actually seems very cheap. The masks are much better and seem of higher quality. However...my son loves it. Put Batman on Christmas morning, and he wore it all day. Only took it off to take his pajamas off to put on his Christmas outfit. He wouldn't even take it off for our pictures, gave up on the fight. Maybe he loves it because it doesn't get hot like many dress-up costumes, it is wide open on the sides. In the long run, he is very happy with it, so that trumps my opinion."
5,great gift,"I gave this to my son for his 2nd birthday. The capes are a little long for him, but it hasn't been a problem. He loves them and will be able to wear them for several years if the material hold ups to wear and tear."
5,Great Superhero Set for ages 3+!,"It's a nice set for the money. Everyone (boys and girls) who come over want to use the costumes and I love that they go over their heads so they won't outgrow them too quickly. The cape is great and attached so it can't fall off. It's perfect on my 5 year old son, and a bit long on 3 year olds, but you can pull up the cape when you tie the waist."
4,Worth the money,"My grandson loved this product. (4 yr old) It is only a front piece with a cape and leg or arm covers, but this makes it very easy to get on and off. He is having a lot of fun changing them out."
1,not worth the money,"This dress up box is a complete rip off. For the price, you get very little - just tunics and masks and arm and leg bands that are way too big. The tunics are made very poorly and the tie in the back ripped after 1 day of use (on both Batman and Superman). Although my son loves it, I can't believe it cost $25. It should cost about 9.99 tops."
2,Broke within seconds of first try-on.,"I gave this set to my 4 year old grandson and the ties pulled right off the cape during the first try on. Needless to say, I was really embarrassed, so we quickly switched capes. I just spoke to my grandson on the phone who asked for a new set because he loves it so much and now two pieces and a strap on the mask are broken. My daughter offered just to sew them back on but that's not the point. The quality is so poor that it made me angry to pay good money for this just to have it fall apart."
5,Super Hero Costumes,"My grandsons and friends absolutely love dressing up as super heroes. If you are looking for a way to get your kids away from the computer and TV, consider these costumes; you won't be disappointed. Imagination is alive and well."
5,My boys love this set!,I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday and he was thrilled. He loves to dress up with his 6 year old brother. They have a blast dressing up in all the costumes and fighting crime. I would recommend it to anyone whose child loves to imitate super heroes.
4,3 year old loves it,I got this last year for my three year old for christmas and he loves it still. When he has friends come over they will get all dressed up. I can even fit into the capes and play with them. Good present
4,Nice combo set for little boys.,"For a 4-year old boy who loves super heroes, it doesn't get any better than this. The material used for these costumes feels a bit thin and flimsy and I will be curious to see how long it lasts. Decent quality for the masks and arm gear (pads). I suppose it will all last as long as his interest lasts. I hope."
2,"4 year old loves it, but poor quality.","This costume set is the most cheapest quality I have seen. On the upside my 4 yr. Old loves it.The only thing I like about it is he can just throw them on over his clothes and I don't have to dress/redress him every 5 minutes for a costume change. It works, just not very authentic looking at all. They are more costume aprons than anything."
5,Hours of fun!,My son received these last year for Christmas and is still playing with them. he loves to dress up as his favorite super heros. This is definitely worth the money!!!
3,the costumes,I recieved the box in rampant timing but didnt realize till a moth later that both masks were missing...so we had to go buy masks
2,Chintzy,"This would have been fine if it had cost $5, but it was not worth $20. Really chintzy/ cheap. Would not recommend. We sent them back."
5,4 year old LOVES it,"My 4 year old son absolutely loves this. The first couple of weeks, he would switch costumes every 15 minutes or so. The only downside is that he can't tie them on himself.Pros: great fit - this fits my 4 year old just fine and even my 10 year old nephew could wear it.my son loves them, regardless of anything else - he just wants to keep playing and pretendingCons: cheaply made - I had to sew one of the ties back on because it fell off.the armbands and legbands are pretty lame - they kept falling off and my son gave up on them pretty quickOverall, I'm giving this 5 stars because it is such a great idea, my son adores it, and although it is cheaply made, it isn't terrible and for the price - it was definitely a great deal"
5,Fantastic costume,"Fantastic for the price you pay. Worth the buy, my boys loved it and it can be worn in any weather. The masks was of quality fabric and is safe to wear without fear of sharpe edges. Would definitely recommend this to anyone."
1,Case Sent Without Foam,"I ordered this expecting to the get the 1600 in black, WITH foam. I received a case without foam. When I called Adorama they said it was a mistake in the advertisement and that they didn't carry a 1600 case with foam, only without foam. Money was spent on a rush order at a different company so I could have the correct case by the time it was needed."
4,Great,Book arrived in good condition - one minor dent which occurred during postage but otherwise fine. Arrived in a decent timeframe too.
3,"Some interesting points, but...!","There are some interesting views and doctrinal stand points made in this video, but it does go on a bit. A bit more grafics or input from others would help, rather than just listening to one man, who does well to string together the history (His story) from Genisis to Revelation through the window of prophesy, but does so for so long that it's easy to drift away from. Decent long-term view of prophesy."
3,A Good Read,"Heart of a Thirsty Woman is about Josie Tolliver's desperate search for her missing sister, Cheyenne. I enjoyed Josie's eccentric personality, her outlook on life, and the people of Sage, Arizona. Her father, Brewster Clay, was an intersting guy with a colorful life. I found Clarence impossibly dull and Cheyenne less than desirable. Overall, I liked the book, despite Josie's childishness. But I think I would buy it when it came out in paperback."
5,I loved this book.,The main character in this book is a woman who leaves Appalachia to move to Arizona to find what she's looking for. This book is so good that it has inspired me to do the same.
5,Great songs stay with you--want to hear them over and over.,"Heard ""Best Part Of My Life"" while in Lake Tahoe over the weekend. Mr.Howe was interviewed on radio(590 AM). Also played was ""Thank God You Live In America"". Wish his songs were played on LA radio. I'm glad there are still people with high family morals, despite so many having accepted low morals from our President. I wish Mr Howe the best."
5,the best cd you'll ever buy!!... Rachel Bott,"Kirk is my uncle's son in law..which makes kirk my cousin i think..me and my family went to mexico with them, and luckily he brought his guitar..we would go on the roof of the house, and sit watching the sun go down, and kirk would play his guitar and when he played (the best part of my life) and another song that isnt on the record..me and my sister and her friend started crying..there family is the greatest family and i miss them and hope to see them soon..( love you kirk, jona, taylor, tanner, hunter, and chasey poo ) hope you see this..bye!"
3,Vicarious insider (through her eyes),"""Regrets Only"" is a flawed blockbuster from another era. The characters' voices are so similar that the dialogue sounds the same, no matter which of the unsympathetic characters is speaking. Yet this reader gobbled it up because Sally Quinn is the ultimate been-there-done-that writer. What she's done and seen most of us will never experience except vicariously.And isn't ""vicarious"" why we read?"
3,THE MONGOLS (INSTANT VIDEO) - IN NEED OF RESTORATION,"THE MONGOLS is an obscure 1961 Italian movie starring Jack Palance as ""Ogatai"", the son of Genghis Khan - a character who squarely has his jaw set on war with the Poles and conquering the city of Kracow. Anita Ekberg plays ""Hulina"", Otagai's instigating mistress and love interest. Unfortunately, the film stock for this film is so severely degraded, that when I attempted to enlarge it (on my laptop), it was met with disasterous results. However, I was able to finish watching it by leaving it on the smaller setting. Although some historical liberties were taken, it was actually enjoyable. So if you have eclectic film tastes - this is a good one time recommended rental.Closed Captioning is not included for the hearing impaired.THE MONGOLSGenre: Action/DramaRun Time: 1 Hour, 55 Minutes"
1,Not good,"I brought this 4GB Drive and it started give me trouble from the day one. When i try to add files to the drive, the old files become unreadable. Each time i have to use this drive, i had to format it and copy all files at once. Waste of money..."
4,A different title...,"This is a very nice collection with a great variety, though I prefer the instrumentals over the vocals. Be aware, however, that it is identical to the collection called ""Best of New Age"".Also, there is a 2-CD version of ""Moonlight Moments"" containing the music of just the 2nd and 3rd discs."
1,Do not buy this Blu Ray if your Blu Ray player is not multi region.,"This Blu Ray was made in England, for region B only. No warning about this fact, in this site. Amazon omitted to do it. I bought the Blu ray and had to give back it because my Blu ray player is not multiregion."
5,Another great book from Lauren Brooke!,"This was a wonderful book, as all of the books in the Heartland series are. Amy is trying everything to cure Mercury of his fear of jumping. She tries everything, but without success. Her last hope is a Native American (Huten) who lives in Ocanumba and has a 'magic touch' with horses. Against Ty's advice, she leaves Heartland with Mercury to go stay with Huten and his family for the week to get Huten's advice on how to cure Mercury. Only, she learns Huten looks at things from a different point of view. She doesn't get it at first, but after a while she begins to understand Huten's way of healing horses.READ THE HEARTLAND SERIES! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"
3,"For teens, not adults","I loved the DVDs for the TV show but the books are written for the teen market, not adults. I expect they're well received by the audience they're aimed at."
5,I say Every New Day is the best !,"I love Every New Day , it's when Amy and Ty start arguing over how to cure a talented jumper called Mercury , but when Ben's help doesn't work Amy goes to an indian to learn that you don't focus on the end result but to step back and look at life a different way ."
5,My Favorite!!!,In 5th grade my AG reading teacher told me about the Heartland seires I used to not like to read but these books hve changed my mined!I am on #15 but Every New Day is my absolut favorite Heartland book! I love the new charachters and the new setting!! I loved the way Huten (amys moms freind) works with his horses and helps with Murcery I wish I could Give it thousands of stars!!!!!( I will Be sooooo Sad when I Have read them all but im looking faward to the nw series Chesnut Hill!)
5,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS BOOK ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AMY AND TY FINALLY START GOING OUT. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE THE FIRST BOOK. BUT THEY START FIGHTING OVER A JUMPER NAMED MERCURY WHO REFUSES TO JUMP. AMY TAKES MERCURY TO HUTEN A NATIVE AMERICAN HORSE HEALER AND FINDS A WAY TO CURE HIM. AMY AND TY MAKE UP.(I WISH THERE WAS MORE ROMANCE/KISSING) LAUREN BROOKE NEVER EVER EVER STOP WRITING OR I WILL SERIOUSLY DIE. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYBODY. ALSO READ ONE DAY YOU'LL KNOW AND REST OF HEARTLAND SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Wonderful, hard to put down, hate to see end stories.",These stories are beautiful and compelling. I wanted them to go on and on! It would be wonderful to see a full length novel from this talented and gifted new author.
5,An accomplished collection seldom seen in a first book,"I enjoyed this collection immensely. The stories are wide ranging and literate, more in the New Yorker vein than contemporary flashiness. They cover every range of life, from childhood to old age. Highly recommended."
2,HARRY CONNICK ON HEROIN,"I like these songs; I like the genre here; but if some ""go over the top"" this one sure goes way ""under the bottom."" Take a Harry Connick Jr. record, turn down the speed -- but shoot Harry up with heroin first! Gloomy is the word. I don't think this album is worth purchasing. By the way, that's not to say that Mark Eitzel isn't worth listening to at some point -- I would recommend ""Snowbird"" to vindicate him from this awful grandma's basement crap."
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,"Picture makes item look rusted and old but it was ""new looking"" metal. 2 Stars because it arrived fast. But now I have to return it."
1,"A Cowboy, A Loser, and a Clueless Wife in the World's Ugliest House","I first had the ""pleasure"" of seeing this mess at a film festival-to say that it did not go over well is an understatement. While it tries vainly to be a Tennesee Williams type melodrama of secrets and forbidden love it really is just a showcase of bad acting and even worse storytelling. The husband's a closet case mope, the wife's a dim bulbed dope and the cowboy has the worst fake Southern accent outside of high school productions of ""Steel Magnolias"". Scenes that are supposed to be high drama elicited laughs from the audience and if you can't see the ""surprise"" ending from a mile away, maybe it's just best that you lay off of movies for a while. I do give this film one star because the house it takes place in is an absolute riot of color(a laugh riot)."
1,The 'Ranch House' Is The Best Part,"Cashing in on the huge success of ""Brokeback Mountain"", newcomer Gregory Christian writes and directs an 80 minute story that begs to be shot. It's barely soft-porn, when a young gay cowboy is picked up at a ""junction"" and taken home to be a handy-man. After sex with the husband, the wife gets into the scene and the whole thing just blows (only it just doesn't - wink, wink). It's a silly tale that goes nowhere and ends nowhere and we wonder why good gay films aren't made more often."
1,Waste of time and money!,Pity there is not a minus star rating - I was forced to rate this 1 star which it does not deserve. I cannot believe I wasted my money buying this junk. Serves me right for not reading reviews first.
3,Such violent reactions to a B movie!,"Granted, the house was garish with disgusting colors and frilly lamps. Granted this was not Streetcar. But I disagree about the acting... much better than in Brokeback Mountain, folks. If you gave it a chance, the performance by James Michael Bobby was nuanced, sensitive, sweet and vulnerable. He has... unfortunately... gone off the radar because of relentlessly negative reviews like the ones we've seen here. The reviewers don't in any way strike me as experts or cognoscenti [look it up]. They sound like the typical type of person who has failed and wants to blame their shipwreck on everyone else. If anyone knows how to locate Mr. Bobby, please put that in a review. I have a screenplay with his name on it. No screen test required. He's another Brando, but the Archie Bunkers of the world want his head. Sad! Just like Romney's 47% crack."
1,TOO BAD FOR WORDS!,"NO ABRASIVE SEXUALITY BETWEEN THE ACTORS...........YOU CAN MAKE A MOVIE,SUCH AS THIS............MORE SEXUAL,DIRTY IN A GOOD WAY? IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOO BORING. I WASH MY HANDS ON THIS MOVIE."
2,Cowboy Junction,"Easily the worst movie I've seen this year. The production was amateurish from start to finish, with a poorly written story and bad acting. Really more of a video than a movie. The house had more ""character"" than the actors, and I found myself distracted by the sheer garishness and color choices apparently made from the reject paint at the local home center store. Based on this one experience, I will be adding the writer and the actors to my ""stay away from"" list, as this can't have been an isolated incident for any of them.A truly unfortunate experience in movie watching"
2,Descent,"This is a descent book, and the information on forwards and defenders is adequate, and at times good even. I thought the book was a little thin, and particularly I thought it lacked in discussing various roles and attributes and positioning for midfielders. I would also not consider this an ""intermediate book"" it is more of a basic-level of tactical understanding, good for a beginer moreso than the advanced or intermediate tactician.In my opinion the midfield is the most important aspect of the game, the link between defense and attack, and the core of possesion and it is largely ignored in this book. A massive flaw to an otherwise descent book.It's worth a read I suppose, but it is hardly earth-shattering or special."
5,Good introduction to strategic elements,"A good introduction to soccer strategy, and excellent review of the most accepted playing systems. It's not only suitable for coaches, but also for players and tv fans interested in getting an understanding of the sport's dynamics."
3,Common,"This book is not very comprehensive into specific details about tactics and how you may formulate certain aspects of football.To me it provides knowledge and helps you to identify what the opposing players are doing and what you can do to counteract those tactics.Most of the defensive tactics explicitly supports the role of a sweeper and how you can make him/her effective even if you don't use him/her in there.The attacking tactics mainly expains the runs the forwards should be making and how to create space up front.As someone said before,excluding the midfield from this book makes it difficult to grab certain concepts and the linkage that should be made between attck and defense.It's no must read to me but I guess you can learn a few things.P.S. I am currently studying phys. ed. to eventually become a football coach.I'm not actively involved in teaching or coaching currently therefore my views may be considered 'amateur'"
3,"Good, but turgid","The cover of this book is a bit deceptive. The diagrams inside the book are simple square and circle diagrams and make no reference to any current or former players. I found them to be a bit less interesting and less dynamic than they could have been.The writing style is, in my opinion, unnecessarily verbose and dense, although I think there's some good content. The book will reward rereading, but was a bit disappointing."
1,dont' be fool,"This molding looks nice in the pic and very attractive the price too. But it only looks like. Please be aware that the price is per foot. More than $3 per foot for 5/8"" rope molding? Got to be kidding. It is way too expensive. Most sellers sell the moldings in 8 feet long price. This seller is price per foot."
3,Higher rated if better examples and Function reference,"If you want to display a form how do you do it? The key is using api function calls. So where is the comprehensive list of api calls along with easy to understand examples? There is none. Not in this book. You have to think of what you want to do then brouse the index in the back and hope something jumps out. Then you have to go to the various parts of the book where the fuction call is indexed and determine what the call is doing by analysing the sample code. The whole process works but, whoa is it slow and exhausting."
5,WOW What a suprise!,I bought this book and read it to my 26 month old daughter. She only took a bottle at night and I told her she was a big girl now and she needed to say bye bye to the bottle. I read her this book twice and handed her a bottle of water instead of milk and she looked at me and I said bye bye bottle. She said bye bye and has never had one since that night. It was so easy I wish I had done it long ago. Now she even sleeps all night!
2,Pastry Crimper,"Unfortunately it does not work well o soft doughs. I had hoped it would make it easier to seal mushroom turnovers, but it just ripped the dough. Back to pressing with a fork."
2,Meh,"Replaced OEM shocks on my '02 Z-71. Don't see much difference. They were touted as performance shocks, better than the OEMs. My suggestion is to just buy the OEM if you are looking to restore original ride and handling."
1,is she kidding me?,"the dance moves are awkward.it is very stupid watching it not to mention doing it! i have absolutely no plans doing this thing called ""Dance Mix"".infact, i will return it and loose some money just cos i do not want to ever see it. some dance moves are meant to be fast some slow...UGH...please if you want to see results in a week(that is,do it twice a day and eat smaller portions), get her BOOT CAMP (1)."
3,It's just okay,I own one other Denise Austin DVD (Yoga & Pilates-Love It!). I agree with some of the other reviews; there is not much queueing and the camera angles are weird. I think they had to edit it that way because Denise or one of the other dancers were out of synch. Denise is all over the place in this workout. If you focus on the guy in the back or the woman to the left of Denise then the moves will make more sense to you. It got my heart rate up. I will use this again for days when I need something fun to get me moving.
2,Bored,"This is good for beginners and Denise's instruction is very good. I was bored to tears with the music, her whispy voice, and basic moves. I love dance exercise videos, but there are very few that are for intermediate to advanced exercisers and that are fun."
2,Bland Workouts,"There's not much to say except bland workouts, which makes me want to choose something else to do. Choreography is bland. She tries to make it exciting by saying, ""Have fun with it!"" Wouldn't need to, if the choreography was more interesting."
3,"Great videos, but................",.............I will probably never use them. Dance steps are too fast so it is impossible to learn them.
1,Not Happy,"I write reviews very rarely. Mostly positive ones, but I have to say this was a disappointment.I fast - forwarded through it to see the dances and work outs. They are short and quirky."
3,Disappointed this time,"I have used Denise's dvd's for years and was excited for a routine that would allow for some dancing. However, I was so disappointed that these dance moves were hard to follow, difficult to learn as there was very little footwork shown. I won't use this dvd again when she has others out there that are easier to learn while giving a good workout. I love Denise's workouts, you will too."
1,"If you have two left feet, forget it","These dance moves are not for beginners. I have two left feet and I found it next to impossible to keep up and get the steps right. The Latin dance was the most difficult. ""Broadway"" style was OK. And the ""club"" moves? I have never seen anyone at a club dancing like that. If you want to look like a fool, by all means break out these moves at a club!Denise Austin is by far the most annoying instructor I have ever seen. Too cheery, talks constantly, and keeps saying ""Arriba!"" and other ""motivating"" slogans. I don't like how all of the exercisers are 20-somethings with perfect bodies (the kind you can only get with the help of a surgeon). Why not show people of different ages, and different body types? These people look like Barbie dolls."
2,Not so much,"I should've listened to that little voice in my head that said, ""remember? you don't like Denise Austin videos!""I was out looking for an exercise DVD and found this one on clearance. I thought why not? So I got it, and I'm not too thrilled now that I've tried it. My favorite part (and the only part I like) is the dance sculpt part. But other than that I don't really care for the DVD. I just don't like Denise's style and I think she's too peppy for me. Sometimes I also feel she is a little rushed (this is from what I have also seen on some of her other DVDs) Anyway, if you are a Denise fan you may love it. If you don't care for her then you really won't like this one. If you are/have been a dancer, stay away!"
3,Not bad...,"I love Denise Austin but I'm not super thrilled with this DVD. I'm finding that with her newer DVDs, she's not explaining the workout or what's coming next or how to do the moves as well as she used to. I think once I do the workouts enough and know them by heart, I'll get a good workout, but until then, I'm just frustrated. I'd encourage someone looking to get one of her DVDs to check out her Personal Training System DVD (I LOVE that one!)."
3,Not very interesting,"I've been doing home exercise videos for years and was disappointed in this one, my first Denise Austin program. The moves are easy, not terribly dance-y and didn't get my heart rate up enough to break a sweat. It's much more like a warm-up than a work-out, and I'm not a coordinated aerobics queen.Her Hip Hop was soulless but perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the music. It's really much more like a rhythm machine playing background to a lounge act. For dance fun, I'd look to Donna Richardson, Kathy Smith, The Method, Crunch or the international series from Acacia.Note: before publishing this review, I attempted to downgrade my rating to two stars. Perhaps in fairness, I'd give it 2.5."
2,Denise Austin can't dance,These dances feel like someone who didn't know how to dance just made them up after watching people who can dance. You feel like you're just impersonating what you think dancers should do.Her warm up goes way too quickly. She doesn't give you adequate time to stretch before changes positions. I almost pulled a muscle trying to follow her so fast. BE CAREFUL!
5,Great workout and you have fun doing it,"I've heard of Denise's name through other people, so I thought I'd give her a chance. I was not disappointed. She does a great job instructing you and getting you motivated. This video has 3 different styles of dance. The jazz portion is fine, but not my favorite - and that's only because I have so much more fun on the urban dance and latin segments.This is a good video because you don't really feel like you're exercising - you're just learning dance routines. But the next thing you know, sweat is pouring down your face! Good stuff and a fun time."
3,Awesome,I like the tape because you can choose what type of dance you want to do. And also there is a warm up and cool down.
5,Pretty Good!,"I have worked out with Denise Austin's DVD's on and off for quite a while. I like Denise because I feel she is honest in wanting to help people get in shape and I believe she enjoys what she does. This DVD wasn't hard to do and it has variation which is nice and helps to keep your interest perked, especially for us 'older'ladies. Kind of a pick and chose type of thing. I liked the Latin dancing the best.Maybe this isn't everyone's cup of tea but I think it is pretty good."
3,decent,"i don't know about anyone else who has used this dvd but i am an actual dancer and to be quit honest this video did not make me sweat one bit. on the other hand it is a fun way to get moving, i recommend it for anyone who is just starting out."
1,IT WAS NOT THE DVD I ORDERED. THERE WAS A DIFFERENT DANCE VIDEO ENCLOSED.,"When I received the DVD and opened the case, there was a different DVD enclosed. It was a Dancing with the Stars DVD. I was disappointed that I didn't receive the Denise Austin one. I really like her exercise DVDs. I took a picture of the cover and the DVD that was enclosed but couldn't find a place to upload the picture."
2,This is a joke,"I have tried working out with this video 5 times now and each time I think ""this is a dance video""? To me there is no ""dancing"" about it. I have purchased 3 of her exercise videos and each time I ask myself why? ....it must be marketing. This one looked like it would be different and fun, but believe me it's not fun nor in any way challenging...it's just plain boring. The whole video was more or less a warm-up.In all of her exercise videos it would be helpful if Ms. Denise would explain the benefits of each exercise move like Jane Fonda does. Whether it works on your cardio, certain muscles groups, or balance. I think that would be more beneficial than watching someone overly perky jumping around and not breaking a sweat. Don't waste your money."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I used to be a huge Denise Austin fan when she had a daily exercise show, but I was highly dissappointed in this DVD. She really lacked the enthusiasm that I was used to seeing and the dance moves were awkward at best. I will most likely sell this DVD at my next yard sale. :("
2,Just okay,"For what its priced at, its an OK buy. But really, I have a decent collection of workout DVDs and this one is way below on my list. Really low. I agree that its meant for a light workout. I think the title is misleading, FAT BURNING? You need a little more action for fat burning.I think dance moves are not too difficult if you are not big into dancing. You'll get it after trying 3-4 times. But it does not have the retention factor, very generic and its pretty dull and doesn't take you to 3-4 times, because it gets boring.Please realize that this is my first workout dvd on any type of dance. Maybe, because it takes 2-3 tries to get the moves, I find this a little boring. I think I prefer more of the kickboxing and sculpting videos that I have on me. A dance video would have to be really entertaining and very effective for me to fit into my regime."
2,Too much talking!,"I was looking forward to dancing the pounds away until her grating voice just wouldn't stop. It's one thing to have to listen to her falsetto perkiness throughout the dvd, but to then be subjected to it over and over (short of turning down the volume) is more than I could handle."
5,History in 3-D,"""Civil War in Depth"" is a fascinating piece of work. The stereoscopic photographs literally jump off the page when viewed properly with the enclosed 3-D viewer. Many of these views were previously published using only one side. Thus the true look and clarity of detail was lost, but within these pages the pictures come back to life!In speaking with Mr. Zeller at Chambersfest 99' in Chambersburg, PA, I found many of these views were never seen until most recently; with several more unseen views recently surfacing after publication. If the opportunity ever presents itself, by all means, see his slide presentation based upon his research.Many thanks to Bob Zeller for the excellent work and detail that went into this publication and I hope to see more newly discovered views in a possible up and coming book.I highly recommend this book to fellow Historians and Civil War buffs. It's a must for your collection!"
3,"Good IDEA, except flawed in execution","The CONCEPT of this book is wonderful, the viewer is adequate and servicable, but as the photo image is enlarged so are the half-tone dots (screening) which make up the picture. I only wish that the pictures were more finely printed, more like the continuous tone originals. As it is, in magnification the dot screen appears very coarse and distracting."
5,Amazing!,This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. Not only does it give you the history of the photograph but also a large amount of photographs of the Civil War. View common Civil War photos in a whole new way and also some never published pictures.
3,"Beautiful and informative, but difficult to use","I'm thrilled that Mr. Zeller put together a book on such a vital and interesting subject, but I find it very difficult to use the plastic stereoscope with the stereoscopic pictures. The viewer is a little too flimsy, and the the book is hardbound, so is hard to keep open when viewing the photographs. Could this be redone with a spiral binding and a viewer that's a little sturdier? I managed to see two photograph pairings in 3-D, and it was delightful, but the rest eluded me."
4,Very Helpful to this Novice,"My great-great grandmother was supposedly born on St Patrick's Day in Dublin...how and why she got from there to Alamosa Co (250 mi from everywhere) before the end of the ninteenth century has been a lingering question of mine for many years. Mr Baxter's book has given me an approach to the question, not to mention a curiously practical guide to the civil and religious meanders of the British Isles' last 1000 years.He presents the information I need to start... what to expect, what not to expect and where many genealogical goodies are stashed both ""over the water"" and here not 5 miles from my home, as it turns out. Who knew?If you are reading this Mr Baxter, thank you so much for the hours and blind alleys you have no doubt saved me from..."
2,not sour.,the aweets arived well packaged however they were not sour because the coating was ruined there was an even selection of the flavors but we cant sell them on.
4,"Youthful, tender and passionate like no other La Boheme","Gheoghiu and Alagna have delightfully matched voices, youthful, passionate and vulnerably tender. I have tended in my later years to dismiss Boheme as a too-well-known pot-boiler of little interest for me. Not with these two - they have managed to create a Boheme revival for me, at times bringing tears to my eyes."
3,Better for less,"For half the price you could get Tebaldi/Bergonzi/Bastianini/Siepi/Corena - and Piero De Palma - all conducted by Serafin in perfectly decent sound, also on Decca. Or of course de los Angeles/Bjorling/Beecham. Those two are my favorite recordings, but there are other good ones as well. The point? I don't hear anything on this release that surpasses - or equals - several other good recordings of Boheme. Given that it's on Decca, I suppose we should be thankful we didn't get Charlotte Curch and Josh Groban in the lead roles. Alagna and Gheorghiu are far better than that of course, but compared to the competition, they really are second tier artists."
4,just a budding opera listener,"Interesting to read all of the succeeding reviews. I would seem to be exposing my lack of musical judgment by admitting that I find Scano's performance exhilarating -- she radiates a tartness & brashness that I associate with Musetta. I wanted to find more recordings of her after listening to this La Boheme, not Alagna or Georghiu. Perhaps this is a result of my inexperience, or perhaps I haven't been influenced by other's opinions (yet)."
3,Only Gheorghiu Shines!,"actually, the only star here is Gheorghiu. She is really great! If are her fan, you'll probably enjoy this recording very much.Alagna is a great tenor, although he always sounds like he is in a hurry... He should take his time and enjoy his own singing a little bit more. Not to mention that he is generally too loud! He should listen more Domingo, and less Pavarotti.If you want a good ""la boheme"", try the one starring Domingo, Caballe and Milnes(SOLTI), or the one with Pavarotti and Freni(Karajan). Both are great!"
3,"Terrible scoring, magnificent Mimi","If you like to listen to Gheorghiu, you might like this album. Reviewer Hogseth is right on but too generous with his stars, I think. The scoring of this ""revised"", return edition is certainly different, but not an improvement on contemporary versions. Alagna sobs annoyingly. Angela certainly had a sore throat after Act 3 from her ferocious coughing which was fortunately absent during the death scene. Chailly should be ashamed of himself for this abysmal Boheme which is rescued only by the lovely singing of Gheorghiu, Alagna if you turn down the volume, and Marcello. If you don't have a copy of the Beecham version, buy one while it's still available and find out what La Boheme should be. This Chailly production doesn't gel, and is painful to listen to, largely because of too close microphone placement and overpowering orchestral dominance over the singers. The recording sound quality is superb throughout."
4,Good knife,"I like this knife. It is very sharp and cuts thru vegetables easily. I find that the 5 inch blade is too short for some slicing jobs, such as cutting large onions or potatoes, but still gets the job done."
2,"Performs great, but blade cracked","I received this knife for Christmas last year and loved it, but about a month ago (after just 10 months of use), there is a crack in the blade. I have no idea how it happened. I hand-wash all of my knives, so it did not go through the dishwasher. I only use it to cut vegetables and fruits. I didn't drop it and I am the only one who uses it. I have owned a lot of knives, but I've never had one crack in the blade. I will buy a Henckels or Wusthof to replace it."
2,"An average knife, at best","I purchased this knife, along with its 7"" sister, as a gift for my wife, who was taken by the santoku knife craze. It works well, sharpens easily, but does not hold its edge any longer than other knives in our kitchen. Maybe that shouldn't concern or surprise me, but considering that Furi charges a premium price for this knife, I would expect exemplary performance, not average. Nevertheless, it is a functional knife that we both use regularly... after sharpening."
5,"Coppertail Knife, Rachael Ray","Awesome knife, we love it, both the real chef and the amateur.Great size for the little lady, and fine for the more big boned sorta cooks in the house.bfg"
3,Not a chef,"This was our first purchase of a chef's knife. It is smaller than expected. It cut very well at first. The weight was great. However, we've only had it a few months and it needs to be sharpened."
2,Furi-ous about this knife,"This knife not only came shipped in a flimsy plastic pouch, it arrived with a dull blade! I had to sharpen ii before it could be used. Unfortunately, it needs to be sharpened each and every use. Verydissappointing, because the knife is actually very comfortable to hold.More comfortable than most knives. If the blade is dull, who cares how comfortable the handle is! I'm going to stick with favorite German steel from now on. Total waste of money."
1,RR is hot but not with these knives,"I bought this knife a year ago as a gift for my sister ... it has good weight to it and the blade and handle are all one construction. However, on my last visit I got the knife out to use and it was so dull it wouldn't cut uncooked meat. I have it home and have spent a good 30 minutes sharpening it. The knife does not hold its edge and has developed rust marks. I cannot recommend this knife. Actually I am a embarrassed that I gave this knife to her....I own several Global knives and that is what I am getting her to replace this one...a dull knife is dangerous."
5,More Than Just a Book,"Clay has done more then write a book, he has opened his heart and his old wounds for the sake of helping others. My 10 year-old daughter has had an ongoing problem at school with some girls who bully her. I bought her a copy of Clay's book (which she so thrillingly got autographed!)She not only read the whole book, and she is not that fond of reading, but we discussed alot of the issues that came up in Clay's life and tried to apply what he had done to my daughter's situation. My daughter is now standing tall, has more self confidence and has learned how not to let those girls bother her. I am very thankful to Clay for giving my daughter and so many others the tools they needed to learn how to love themselves. I urge parents to get this book for their child, and don't forget to read it yourselves, it is very inspiring."
5,enjoyable,I enjoyed reading this book very much. It was written quite well and the large letters was easy to read.
5,Wonderful read,"Clay finaly lets his fans into his life. Just enough to keep us interested and to let us see how he grew up, and why he made the decisions he made. At the same time, he seemed to understand how much is enough without telling us too much in the way of personal information. Its a tricky lesson to learn for a lot of authors but Aiken does a great job on this book, capturing some painful moments in his past, and ending each chapter with the snarky sense of humor his fans have come to love.I also enjoyed all the snippets of wisdom from his mom, friends, and teachers.The best thing about this book was knowing that I wasn't the only tortured nerd out in the school system! LOL So thank you Clay for making me feel less alone.I recomend this book to any fan of Clay's and to non-fans as well."
2,Oversold,"I read a few of the reviews of this book and I am wondering if there were pages missing from the copy I have because I found nothing inspirational about it at all, nothing I could use as helpful advice for my child.I don't know why Dr. Phil chose to feature this particular book and author on his show and I wrote to his producers registering my disappointment. I have to believe that Dr. Phil did not even read it.. We all take risks when we buy books endorsed by celebrities like Dr. Phil, Oprah, etc., this was a first (and last) time for me.I don't have much more to offer in the way of a review other than to say this is not a book for parents looking for advice on bullying. If you have some interest in the personal musings of Clay Aiken you might find it entertaining but to call it inspirational is a gross exaggeration. For me it was a wasted $20.00 and next time I will check first with my local library."
4,Great,"I liked the book and found it to be a very good memoir. I also found that the book stood even without the writer being famous or having a ghost to assist him. After reading this I read A Brush with Darkness by Lisa Fittipaldi and found that you can be inspired, motivated and enlightened by people who are deemed to be famous....both are on my highly recommended list! If you need to be jump started to change your life read BOTH of these books."
3,Revealing Story,"I recently finished his book in just a few hours. Excellent! The book reveals his life as a child, facts about his biological dad and his step dad, and his lovely mother. Many chapters actually moved me to tears. This man is humble, extremely talented and gifted.A definite Must Read! You will enjoy the trip down memory lane with Clay."
5,Inspirational,"When I read this book I laughed, I cried, and reflected to my own experiences. Clay Aiken has so much wit and is a wonderful story teller.I would recommend this book for anyone but especially kids that get picked on at school, as Clay was. His childhood was filled with pain but he chose to rise above it all. From his biological father to his step-father,he had always gotten the short end of the stick and wondered what it would take to be loved. Wonderful, inspirational reading."
5,Clay Faces the Abyss,"Clay Aiken is about courage. He is about love. And he's about joy. This book moved me. Clay is able to stand at the edge of the world -- prostrate exposed, vulnerable and sensitive -- look into the great wide dark abyss and not be afraid to enter that abyss with his eyes open, fists clenched and his chin up. Clay knows who he is, and he lives by a code of honor and pride that only maybe 10% of all the world (though that may be overestimating it) can hold themselves to. I admire Clay and hope he keeps opening doors."
3,not the best but inspirational,"This was surely inspirational, even though it was not that well written. the first part started like a child narrating, but his writing got much better towards the mid part of the book; it also gives us a glimpse of what clay had been through in life and surely he had to go through much from a indifferent biological father to dealing with a narrowminded stepfather. with his unusual looks he was clearly picked on and bullied by his peers. knowing all these gives the readers an insight of his unique and unusual persona, and how he will definitely continue to struggle with issues for most of his lifetime.whatever happens I believe that it is his talent, drive and motivation to succeed that will keep Clay on the track to superstrdom. there is really no one quite like him and I really wish Clay AIken all the luck in the world."
1,Should be categorized as fiction,"Clay has proven that he is incapable of telling the truth, so none of the ""experiences"" he cites in this book can be relied upon as actually having occurred. A complete waste of money."
5,Truly Inspirational,"I loved this book written by a very wise young man, someone who has taken the negatives in his life and turned them into a source of true learning about what makes a life lived into a life worth living. Clay speaks from his heart, relating things he has learned about coping with some of the things lots of children have to live through, in a simple easy to read prose many young people could relate to. I think this is a very encouraging and inspirational first book by someone who is still young enough to remember what it felt like to be abused, bullied and at times treated very unfairly but who has used his God given talents and mature attitude to overcome and turn the negative into a joyful positive."
5,Wonderful book for any age,"If you liked Clay Aiken before, you will love him now. A popular adage among the Clay Nation is ""We came for the voice, we stayed for the man."" If you don't understand what this means, then read the book. You will get it.This book will take you through Clay's emotional journey from childhood to American Idol to the present day. You will learn about the passion behind the voice and about Clay's work with special needs children that lead to the creation of his foundation, the Bubel Aiken foundation (http://www.thebubelaikenfoundation.org). Clay has a wonderful vision for the world, and I can't wait for his dreams of inclusion to come true.You do not need to be a fan of Clay Aiken, the artist, in order to be a fan of Clay Aiken, the man."
4,Great for fans,"This is a book that would hold a lot of interest for Clay Aiken fans. Clay discusses aspects of his life growing up, that many of us can relate to. Reading about how he overcame difficulties is inspiring and heartwarming especially for younger reader"
1,only lasted about 10 months & I had to use my warranty on it!,Battery was dead after about 10 months of service & I had to explained to the local dealer about the warranty & paid them $57.00 to get a replacement which makes this battery extremely expensive.
1,Should be 0 stars.,"I've had 4 of these batteries in the last 2 1/2 years. They die on me every 3-6 months. These batteries are made to absolutely no standards. No heavy loads, they just up and stop working right. I've only had 4 because after I bought the first at Pep Boys, they've exchanged the successive bad ones.We have a professional battery test machine at work. I tested battery 4 after receiving it and letting it charge and it was only putting out 85% of it's rated power. That's 15% lost just sitting on the shelf.I'm about to go in for a 5th and I will not be putting it in my car. Instead, I'll be buying a DieHard Platinum from Sears."
3,Not as good as it should be !,This book is not half as good as it should be. It seems to be badly edited and hastily compiled.There is no flow also.Sumit.
4,Wonderful History Info,Students learned so much about Ellis Island in watching this. Some parts might be a little tedious for younger children. I used it with gifted 4th graders and they seemed fine with it.
5,Worth watching by everyone whose ancestors came thru here,"I enjoyed this view of Ellis Island, particularly the shots of the building before it was restored to it's present state. And seeing some of the museum is special, if one cannot get to the Island, this is a good representation."
4,"Good quality, nice picture!","Good quality, nice picture! Color layer is strong and pieces were accurately cut out.A lot of patterns make this puzzle strong but interesting."
1,Not the Real thing,"Just so you know, the songs on this album are not by the original artists.I expected a true ""various artists"" mix - what I got was poorly covered versions of all the songs. If you just want something with a beat to help you workout, fine. But if you expect ""real"" mixes by ""real"" artists - you will be sadly disappointed. This is true of all these volumes. And certainly, at $20, you'd be much better off buying any of the Ministry of Sound CDS, which are true compilations of club hits - by actual artists."
4,Works great...,"The laptop rolling case exceeded my expectations with the dual use and functions. However, it wasn't as big as i thought it would be. But it certainly does the job!"
4,POTOMAC SwissGear,"Compact, sturdy. Multiple pockets for a variety of uses. Wheels are sturdy. The handle is easy to collapse and expand. The laptop case enclosed is of good quality. Great price for what you get. I had a Samsonite rolling carrier prior to this and I like this one better."
3,"Handle broke with first use! BUT, Beach Camera came through!","I would not recommend this case because on first use, the handle already broke off completely from the case. HOWEVER, Beach Camera came through and fully refunded back my money, including shipping. I would definitely do business again with Beach Camera...thanks again!"
1,Looks Nice... but handle broke quickly in normal use,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas 2011. She started using it in January, gently mind you. By Feb 8 the retractable handle broke rendering it entirely useless for the purpose of a rolling bag. Wouldn't spend my money on something so easily broken had I known."
3,Great product but too big for me.,"There is nothing wrong w/ the Potomac rolling case. It's a quality product. However, I travel on regional jets quite often and find it too large to fit comfortably under the seat and heavy. I enjoy the computer bag that comes w/ it. If you have documents and many electric accessory this bag is good."
3,Luggage,"This is an alright travel bag for 1-2 days. Not what I had expected, a little small for 3+days. The quality is great as expected with Swiss Army gear and the laptop bag is great for travel and security at the airport. Capt Dan"
5,Just what I was looking for....,"The POTOMAC from SwissGear Double Gusset Rolling Case is exactly what I was looking for. The Executive Director of our agency asked me to purchase a rolling case she could take with her to conventions and workshops. One that she could put her laptop in, and several files, plus office supplies she might need. It had to be light enough for her to use (she is only 5' 1"" tall), and the wheels had to roll smoothly for her to navigate turns, hallways, etc. I ordered this, and it was better than the description on amazon.com! It is very well made, sturdy, has plenty of compartments to store items, the laptop section is nicely padded, the wheels roll very smoothly, and the handle telescopes up and down with ease. The Executive Director loves it, and she might want me to order another one for her associate."
3,can this bad handle 2 17in laptops with cables?,"I am looking at the Potomoc I have 2 laptops that are 17"" Will this bag work? I'm trying to say away for a huge bagCn any of you help?"
3,I expected a little more in quality department,"Yes, it is a very good cd with a few songs that I would call legendary, but audio quality is hard to describe as good. Dub is something that I enjoy a lot due to quality of sound, but not with this cd."
5,Cate Brothers Live,"This album is excellent. The five members of the band are all great musicians. They complement each other and no one tries to hog the stage. The music is a blues/soul/pop combination. This was recorded live at ""Chester's"", a small club in Fayettville, AR. The best..."
4,Wants some? Get some!!,"This guy is bringing in it like he got something to say. Somebody must have told him he couldn't rhyme and he set out to prove them wrong. He says, ""I chose, to keep the rythm moving like James' shoes, I up on Hill Street making you busters sing the blues!!""on ""Hate to break it"". Its a solid debut piece. I met this guy and he is cooler than a fan. Check it out. You WILL like it."
4,Own Massages at Home,"Instead of going out somewhere to get a quick massage or just to stretch out, this is a great way to relieve some of the muscle soreness after workouts."
2,Not enough info,"I found this book frustrating. It gives great information about setting the pond up, but not much information about keeping a pond functioning properly. For example, it lists one solution for fixing aphid problems, but doesn't show pictures of what they look like so you have to guess if an aphid infestion is really what you have. I was disappointed it had so little information about dealing with plant and fish problems that inevitably come up after awhile. I also think it would have been helpful to have added more pictures of the plants it suggests using in container ponds. I guess I would say this book really is a super simple guide to container garden ponds, but unfortunately it doesn't cover or simplify many of the complexities that arise after it is completed."
3,Wait and See,"Although Ms. Kotovo displays a potential to become a virtuoso in her own right, but it is too early to tell. I will reserve my judgment until I hear her play more ambitious classical pieces. The classical music world is trying to find a successor to J. Du Pre (Nobody knows what could have been), and she probably comes closer to her than anyone else. Everyone is enamoured with Yo Yo Ma these days (by the way, he plays the same instrument Du Pre played), but he does not really understand the true passion behind music. Technically competent but emotionally flat. . ."
1,Garbage,"This was my first exposure to Ms Kotova's work, and I have to say it does not inspire me to listen to her more. Perhaps I should have started with some other work of hers. The folks who glow about her tone, etc obviously have no exposure to REAL cellist. Suffice it to say, if you are a true classical music fan, run away from this garbage as fast as you can. If, on the other hand, you live by the brilliance of cHarlot Church, or Andrea Bocelli, then this is exactly the sort of thing for you. For those who sincerely want to hear what alternatives there are to this cellist, may I suggest anything by Janos Starker or Mischa Maisky, and Anner Bylsma for variety. THEN we can talk cello."
3,Sweet tone,"I discovered Kotova through a Readers Digest article, and was intrigued, so I bought the disc. The many short selections of the cd is not enough to fully determine what she can bring to the great masterpieces. Based on the selections contained on the cd, one can immediately tell that she is a great cellist with a deep resonant tone. The standards, like Vocalise and Petroushka are well played. The other pieces have been orchestrated by Kotova, which makes the interpretation unique. I always enjoy hearing common pieces in new setting. Let's wait till Kotova tackles some warhorses, like the Shostakovich concerto, or the Bach concertos. If it's anything like her performances here, they will be welcomed by the classical community."
1,One wonders what can we expect from Philips next!,"What is it: good looks or a good instrument? Since when such mediocre playing would interest Philips enough to sign such an artist? Very upsetting! This is 'music for a russian dinner', exactly as NYTimes wrote. The cellist and the orchestra are mediocre, the conductor is even less than that!"
2,Mediocre effort,"While not entirely lacking in emotional resonance, this book is definitely a drop in quality from Donaldson's science fiction and fantasy. I got the impression that he tosses these mysteries off, for fun and without much attention to detail, between writing the books he really cares about. It's not that it's entirely unworthwhile, but mostly the characters resonate only in two dimensions, and come off as insanely obtuse. The plot is so simplistic as to be laughable. You'll have it figured out by Chapter Two. This can be a fun, quick read nevertheless, but don't expect the grace, dignity, and care that Donaldson generously lavishes on his sci-fi/fantasy works."
5,fascinating,"'don't want to give away anything from this theory that reads like a good mystery so i'll be brief:i'm not a shakespeare expert but i found this book thrilling and convincing in the case and narrative it presents supporting a theory of ""who shakespeare really was.""i am aware of the more widely accepted (and respected?) theory that shakespeare was the 17th earl of oxford.nonetheless, mr hoffman gets my vote."
1,The Crystal Stair,"After hearing great things about The Crystal Stair and The Inner Door, both wrote by Eric Kline, I decided to order five of each for gifts to friends. Upon receiving The Crystal Stair, I opened it and began to read it.Within the first six pages, I found it is just another ""money maker"" from one who does not Know. Eric Kline is writing of things that he does not know. As he states; ""Jesus who is Sananda is the Ashtar Commander of the extraterrestrial masters."" The Other Side does not contain chain of command, for All is equal. He also states; ""We are in the third-dimensional reality, and will leap into the fifth-dimensional or higher level."" The Other Side it the ulimate, there is no higher. He writing indicates teaching from higher beings, but they do not teach they Inspire.Two foolish books wrote by a foolish man. Do not buy!"
5,A must read for anyone on the Path to Ascension,Since this book came into my possession it has been on a continual journey. Everyone who has read it has been truly uplifted and passed it on to a friend. Most have ordered it for themselves. It is a book that you will read several times and refer back to often as events occur in your life.
3,something lost from live set to cd,"i am a huge fan of hardware, having seen many of his shows over the past four years. however, after buying this cd, i realized that something is often lacking in his recordings. his cd's lack the power and atmosphere of his shows, and i rarely find myself listening to his lps after a few weeks of listening. they lack the complexity of his sets. i recommend that true trance fans, especially fans of the darker orlando trance scene, check him out live, but i feel there are many other cd's out there that are more powerful than this one."
5,a crucial and fascinating story,"The 1979 rise of Nicaraguan workers and peasants inspired freedom-loving people around the world. The FSLN led a massive mobilization that uprooted the long-standing Somoza system of repression and subservience to U.S. capitalism. The armed people began a road of social justice and genuine sovereignty. Led by the Sandinistas, they defeated the invasion of counterrevolutionary contras -- armed and commanded by Washington. Yet the FSLN, at the moment of its greatest victories, turned away from the road of leading the workers and peasants forward to the overturn of capitalism. Instead, they reversed course and abandoned land reform, workers rights, and sought to become an inoffensive bourgeois political party. Even that modest ambition was thwarted, and they lost power in 1990."
5,If you want great music of The King of Pop then you will love this cd,I wasn't real sure if this CD was the one that I really wanted of The King Of Pop and I went online and read the reviews and decided to take a chance and it is a great Cd it is of good sound and quality and I am so glad that I purchased this CD so Michael Jackson's music will live on forever!!!! It was so easy to order online. The instructions to order online was easy and took hardly anytime to put in my order.You will love this Cd it is great!!!!!!
1,ripped off by amazon,never received product and amazon wont replace nor refund product just accused me of telling a lie
5,GODS GIFT TO ALL OF US IS GONE !!!,"As always, every song he sings makes us feel better. MICHAEL, you will be missed very much!!! GOD must have needed you more. Love YOU, Maureen ..."
3,Michael Jackson CD arrived without disk!,"The first Michael Jackson CD we ordered arrived in the plastic seal, looking brand new. We opened it and there was no disk inside! The replacement you sent was fine although the jewel case was cracked. The CD is okay, though and we are enjoying it a lot. Thank you for taking care of this so promptly."
2,As if you haven't spent enough on this guy yet...,"There seems to be no end to the crass commercialism of Michael Jackson and his record company.You have pointless 'remix' cd's (old material, slightly tweaked)...you have his new album coming out in not one, but 3 flavors (all the same material mind you, just different cover colors)...and now this re-re-issue of more of the same hits but released at the same time as his latest to seperate you from even more of your hard-earned cash.Folks, you'd save yourself a lot of effort if you just earmarked a percentage of your paycheck to go straight to Jackson, as this is all that he's getting you to do.King of Pop? Nah...more like the King of Recycling."
4,"You can't ""Beat It"".","This is basically the same hits disc that was part of his ""HIStory"" double album, but without the second disc of new stuff. It's a simple 1 disc best of, that I think is better than the recent ""Number Ones"" release. Included here is ""Rock With You"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Bad"", and ""Black And White"", among many other hits. For the most part this has what it should, but I do miss ""Human Nature"" and ""Smooth Criminal"". The ""Number Ones"" collection is similar, but I think this one is his ""Greatest Hits""."
5,enjoy yourself,i have been looking everywhere for this song. its sung by the jacksons. i remember back in the day when they were a guest on Cher. could someone please tell me where to look for this song? thanks.
4,Can't beat it...,"After the untimely death of MJ, I realized that I was a fan of his music but did not own any of his records. For my needs, this was a great album which contains many of his best songs. The only song missing was Human Nature which I downloaded on to my iPod. My wife and kids also were happy with the album."
5,Helps heal the sadness,I loved Michael Jackson. I still love Michael Jackson. This CD has helped keep him around when the feeling of loss is overwhelming.
4,Amazon Verified Purchase,"I like it, it arrived on time and in really good condition. I would recommend this seller."
1,History Doesn't Repeat,"Michael Jackson was always declared The King Of Pop. But, why did this re-release only half the record than the whole record? I'm surprised. The other ten songs from the History Past, Present, and Future Book 1 are not on this collection. This is not worth buying. The earlier 1995 release is much more worth the dollar. Beat this collection."
5,It's great!,I am a tried and true fan of Michael Jackson and enjoy listening to this CD. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan.
5,Michael Jackson greatest hits,"Super album and a must for MJ fans. Got most of the good ones on it, so lots of enjoyment."
3,"5 stars for the material, 0 stars for the record company","This CD has no reason to exist. It is merely the first disc of the 2-CD History set, ostensibly remastered, although the sound is already of excellent quality on the original. There is nothing new added to the contents or the packaging, unless you count the cover photo. Better they should have added another hit or two. If you have the original CD you do not need this one at all. (...)"
4,great collection but missing too many songs,"this collection is great but its missing too many big hits. this is what the track listing should have been1. don't stop til you get enough2. off the wall3. rock with you4. she's out of my life5. the girl is mine6. billie jean7. beat it8. wanna be startin somethin9. human nature10. pyt11. say say say12. thriller13. i just can't stop loving you1. bad2. the way you make me feel3. man in the mirror4. dirty diana5. another part of me6. smooth criminal7. leave me alone8. black or white9. remember the time10. in the closet11. jam12. heal the world13. who is it14. gone too soonif this would have been the track listing and the set was a double disc instead of a single disc, this would have been the only jackson disc most fans would need. nevertheness it does include all his biggest hits and is a great introduction to the king of pop. (for a better introduction, get thriller first which is a better album than this.)"
4,"Good, But There Are Some Missing...","I think it was a great idea to release this so the casual MJ fans wouldn't have to buy the double-disk History. There are many great MJ tracks (""Thriller"", ""Remember the Time"", ""Rock With You"") However, there are some great songs missing...""Smooth Criminal"", ""In the Closet"", and the beautiful ballad ""Human Nature."" Plus, for this one-disk issue, I wish they would've went ahead and threw on ""You Are Not Alone."" But again, for the casual MJ fan, this is a good buy. All of the songs you are probably familar with are on here. Enjoy!"
5,ONLY THE BEST,"THERE ARE ONLY THE BEST SONGS OF MICHAEL, BUT THERE AREN'T SONGS FROM INVINCIBLE, BUT IT'S GOOD."
4,Only a partial look at HIStory,"Greatest Hits-HIStory (which is basically disc one of his HIStory album) is a total hit & miss.Of course the greats are represented(Billie Jean,Beat It,Don't Stop..,Rock With You,etc)but what was unnessesarily included(The Girl Is Mine,Heal The World) outweighs what should've been included(Human Nature,Off The Wall,Dirty Diana,Say,Say,Say,Will You Be There).Maybe the best of ""HIStory continues""(Scream You Are Not Alone,Earth Song,Stranger In Moscow) should've been interspread with the old hits.It may not be HIStory but it would've justified his place in history"
3,Not a good source for Carolyn Bessette information.,"This back of the book cover led me to believe there would be interesting information on his wife, Carolyn. Ha! There was practically no information on his wife. I learned more about her in a single magazine article then from this book. It has the basic geographic info: born, lived, schooled. Boring. If you are a diehard JFK JR then go for it, otherwise there are much better books on him. If you are looking for Carolyn info, look elsewhere. Period."
4,Not much about last few years of life,"I enjoyed reading this book it was very informative and easy to read. However, there was NOT much written about his romance and marriage with CAROLYN BESSETTE -LESS THAN 5 PAGES!! This disappointed me. Tons of info about his youth and school days were revealed, even about his dabbling with narcotics. But, if you want more recent biographical material this is not the book."
2,Less Jack and Jackie; More John-John,"I felt that this book had too much information about Jack and Jackie and their lives together and about Jackie's life after the assasination of JFK and not enough information about John's childhood and adult life. It was very difficult for me to stay interested in this book. While I finished reading it, the ending was very disappointing. Most of the book was about Jackie and how she raised her children. I would not recommend this book to friends."
4,Still mourning the death of an unforgettable man,"This book had many good points, and I finished it fairly quickly. It made me laugh out loud, and at other poignant moments I cried. I enjoyed reading about John's college exploits, his years as an assistant D.A. and details of his relationships with the ladies. It was vividly written, capturing my imagination in a way that presented me with a good sense of his splendid personality, in turn giving me an evengreater admiration of the man. Too much time, I think was devoted to his early childhood days, and I was disappointed that missing was a major portion of his later life after the debut of GEORGE, and of his married life. I would recommend this book, though, to anyone wanting a keepsake to revisit the memory of our beloved John Jr."
2,"Shallow, biased biography","This book was very disappointing primarily because important events were completely left out of the book. Missing from the book was a critical amount of material concerning the last days of JFK Jr's death, and the circumstances and display of poor judgement that lead to the fatal crash that claimed three lives. It was as if the author in her bias toward her subject sought to depress the truth so that her Icon would not be tarnished. The investigation into his death is not complete, but there are certain facts to the accident that cannot be explained away merely because of mechanical failure. The incomplete ending of the book is only one example of the fluff over substance the author employs."
1,Bait & Switch,Ordered the stove marked down to 18.95 from 128.95. - A heck of a deal! Item described was a Primus multifuel stove - item received is a Primus multitool. Buyer beware.
4,Christmas Can't be Far Away,"Check out ""Christmas Can't be Far Away"". I was not previously familiar with this gem. It's got lyrics and a tune that were perfect for Uncle Burl. The other lesser known songs are fine as well. The more popular songs are less interesting with the exception of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" which has some of the weirdest rhythms I've heard on this song. The ox and lamb could not have kept time to this. Overall, very appealing overall."
4,Great Christmas album even for non-Burl Ives fans!,"Burl Ives was primarily known as one of America's greatest folksingers; and that quality is the strongest part of this album. In addition to Rudolph (from the TV special) and Holly Jolly Christmas, Burl really shines best on songs that tell wonderful stories, most notably ""Christmas is a Birthday, Christmas Child, and Christmas Can't be Far Away"". You've probably never heard most of these but I guarantee these will enhance the experience of anyone who enjoys the yuletide season. He is less spectacular on the standards such as ""White Christmas"", and ""Silver Bells"", (probably due to our familiarity with the Bing Crosby versions) but they are nevertheless sturdy, well-produced versions. My kids love the whole album, but I enjoy the whole thing, I am sure, for different reasons. The production is 1st rate, and Burl can spin a story in song as well or better than anyone. Try it and you'll find at least a few gems in here."
4,Frosty Lives On!,Always enjoy Burl Ives' voice and singing style. This is a wonderful showcase and one that will get played during the holiday season.
5,excellent lyrical view of two concertoes,"... i am just going to add a few lines to those reviews already here for this cd... yes, rachmaninov takes a nobler approach than most pianists and to me this is rachmaninov... melancholy and general flow of music, two traits emphasized by ashkenazy in this recording (a fact also confirmed by his choosing of the simpler and more lyrical cadenza in no. 3 which rachmaninov himself played) make this a top notch performance in the market today (i would also add earl wild on chandos, argerish on philips, rachmaninov himself on naxos, janis on mercury living presence, and richter on dg)"
5,One of the best,"Ashkenazy plays with plenty of power and passion in these recordings, and the sound quality is quite good. The Second is superbly executed, but the Third could be a bit more tenderly played. But, as Rachmaninoff said, this concerto was written ""for elephants."" It's still one of the best renditions I've heard, and is at a good price. Don't pass this one up."
1,"Opinion of a ""true"" believer","I read the book and took the class that the Way International sells you with the book. V.P. Wierwille is a genius! He was able to brain wash so many people with this book. The book is well written and flows through topics well. It is an excellent FICTION novel. I can sum it up in one word, CULT."
1,Poorly writtren,"Most of the material in this book is a poorly presented copy of the information contained in 'How to Enjoy the Bible' written by E. W. Bullinger in 1906. Do yourself a favour, read the originals, which are well written and well presented from the pen of a true Biblical scholar."
1,Victor Paul Wierwille was a cult leader,"I've read this book and studied this book for over six years...As another review stated, Wierwille copied much of his material from others, what he wrote was not original. He was a cult leader of the worst kind, he took some truths and mixed it with his cult teachings and lies. Please, do not bother to order this book, it will be a waste of your money and your mind. The basis for all of Wierwille's teachings -- as is the basis for many Christian cult leader's teachings is: 1. The Bible is translated improperly. 2. The Bible is missing parts. 3. The Trinity is a fake concept made up by men. Thus is the foundation for most all of Wierwille's teachings..."
5,He told the truth,"This man was a true researcher of God's Word and did learn from many others such as Kenyon, Bullinger, Stiles, Leonard etc... I have been a student and now a minister for over 25 years and have found on my own that this book is worth its weight in gold. To those who disagree all I can say is that you followed a man and not the Word."
3,Walk in the Clouds is fantastic,"A walk in the clouds is a charming wonderful movie, 5 stars. A good year wasn't very good at all."
5,Chavez production,"Nice cd full of fresh instrumentals. This music is powerful westcost undergroud hip hop, but slightly different than others.Beats are very clean and deep, with addition of some trip hop grooves, which produces nice slow(but also strong) tempo. Wery rhythmic.Sounds similar to Dialated peoples or Swollen Members.Recommended."
1,no audio CD/explanatory key,"This book without an audio CD and an explanatory key is useless. My seller charged me full cost for it but did not send me an audio CD and the key, watch out when you place this order.Will any one help me now and immediately? I take IELTS on October 6th 2007."
5,"A delightful DVD installment in the award-winning ""Travel with Kids"" series","Travel with Kids: Alaska is a delightful DVD installment in the award-winning ""Travel with Kids"" series. Following the Roberts family as they see the snow-covered wilderness of Alaska firsthand, experience dog sledding and horseback riding, visit Anchorage and observe wildlife, in this presentation sure to delight armchair travelers and prospective Alaska vacationers alike. bonus features include a trip planner with a wealth of information about activities, accommodation, and transportation, a family travel tips and resources section, and an ""Alaska at Home"" section including a wildlife guide, crafts and recipes. Highly recommended. 85 minutes."
4,Work as expected.,"I had to replace my girlfriend's shifters. I was told I could fix the old one's by soaking them in warm water, but didn't want to bother. For the price it was worth it to me just to replace the old ones. They shift well and do what they are supposed to. There isn't much more I can say about them. They came will new cabals and cabal housing. What more can you ask for for the price??"
2,Low quality USB,"This USB barely lasted for two weeks, right after saving some files from a laptop computer the device completely stopped working and not it doesn't even turns on. However this one could be a defective model but as far as I got to use it for my college duties it was a big disapointment."
3,wave-finder surf guide: Indonesia,Book seems to have alot of info (I am going next spring) The first book fell apart. I sent it back Amazon and got another copy and it fell apart also. This is kind of frustrating for a book that I had planned to travel with. I have a copy of the central america book and it seems fine.
2,Cute but not functional,"This costume is so adorable but the buttons wouldn't snap properly or would come undone and the ""fur"" would shed and get all over baby's face and mouth. He was very uncomfortable."
1,Where is all the fur!?,"I just received my costume today, and am extremely disappointed with the lack of fur on it. It is not even close to the picture, the thickness on the arms an legs is 1-2"" at best, and the fur on the head isn't much longer than my son's real hair. Talk about misleading pictures!"
2,tempos distorted,"I heard some of this --not all. I found it too fast and rushed in several parts, which made it irritating. Also it was somewhat overblown, trying to make a dramatic effect---like the most magnificent music ever---befitting greatness and royalty. But it doesn't need to be exaggerated. It was all too much. It shouldn't be too slow of course, as if to accomodate a slow ballet dancer. But too fast loses the charm and full value of these wonderful melodies and instrumental harmonies. Too fast tempos are very distracting, at least for me. Not everyone agrees and it depends on how fast."
1,Soul singer with no soul,"I bought this CD because I thought 'Gee... anyone discovered by the great Johnny Otis must be great'. WRONG! I've heard recordings made in house garages that sound better, the sound is hollow, Heather Marie sounds like she's standing six feet away from the microphone. Then there's her singing, to call it 'amateurish' would be kind. I'm assuming that Mr. Otis' regular musicians were on vacation and he recruited musicians for the session from a local Junior High School... And the material of songs! Predictable, predictable, predictable. I'm happy I bought this CD used (I'm only out $5.99 plus tax). I rest easy knowing this mediocre piece of music will be heard by a very limited audience. Now do yourself a favor, check out Dinah Washington, Big Maybelle, Lavern Baker, Etta James and other great R&B/Blues singers. Forget you ever heard the name Heather Marie and don't even think about ordering this CD. Johnny what were you thinking?"
3,More about the women and not the man....,"When I first started reading this, it seemed more about the women (his mother and wife) than the Marquis. So, I read further to prove myself wrong.....not very successful. I had read another reveiw about this book that said the author sounded like a mother chastising her son; that sounded pretty close to what I read from the book. When it comes to the Marquis de Sade, I beleive that the author should have a presence, but not a(n) seemingly overbearing/opinionated one like in this book. I didnt finish it; after a few pages I realized this was not what I was looking for: something about the Marquise de Sade, not the women in his life.If you want some type of psychoanalysis-biography of de Sade( which I want) this isn't it. It seems well researched, just not about the right subject."
1,An interesting monster made boring.,"Considered one of history's more interesting monsters, this book reduces the poor Marquis to a pathetic victim of his plain, bourgeois wife and his domineering mother-in-law. It relies much too heavily on quoting correspondence written in the florid style of the period. Oddly, each time Sade staged one of his orgies at least one of the victims complained to the authorities and he was promptly jailed. The activities described seem tame compared to what is available on the porno shelves on any video store in the country."
3,Needs a little more substance.,"As a current Methodist wanting to learn more about my religion, I was hoping for a little more detail. This book is a little too basic although it might be a good first reading for a person who is considering joining the Methodist religion. On the plus side, the information is clearly presented and is easy to read."
3,Something really basic,"I'm actually a Catholic, but I've been interested in finding out why the Methodist methods (try saying that 5 times really fast!) are different from ours, but yet, in some ways they're just like our ways of doing things. Unfortunately, when I saw this article of reading I thought it would be longer than what it actually is...cause it looked like a book from what was being shown on the site. But actually, it isn't really a book, it's like a pamphlet. So i was disappointed in that i spent that much money on something that looked like I could've gotten from a church.But, it was pretty informative.There's probably better forms of information, more in depth forms of information about this branch of religion out there that's more lengthy. But, if you just want a basic idea of the practices Methodists partake in, then this is worth getting I suppose."
4,Good resource,A good book to have to help answer questions about the Methodist Church and understanding how they worship. It is especially good for new members of a Methodist Church or those seeking more info.
3,Good to a point,"This book started off promising, and I really enjoyed it up until part 5. From there, I started to lose interest, things got dragged on, and like several other reviewers I had a hard time finishing it. The ending wasn't horrible, but it was definitely just a way to wrap things up and end the story. The MD has an interesting plot, but it couldn't live up to being a fulfilling read. So, I liked it to some extent, but it won't be anything I'll be remembering in the future."
2,Horror Fantasy,"The Greek god gave 6 year old Billy a magic stick that could heal or kill.He made bad things happen to his Granny and his brother. Bad things happen to his parents and he lives with relatives whose daughter has Billy's son, Judge, a crazy. Billy becomes a Doctor and finds a cure for Aids but creates a far worse plague, ORVIDS. Bad things eventually happen to Billy and Judge takes over and I can't believe I really waded through this book."
2,"Sadly, a waste of time","The story is OK, but the writing is ... well, boring. I am not the kind of reader who requires a lot of action, but I do need the language to speak to me. Otherwise, why not just read the plot summary? Disch seems to think that his personal distaste for his characters (Catholics, racists, facists, and self-serving people of all stripes) is by itself adequate to captivate the reader, but he doesn't write with a style that connects with me emotionally. He has a kind of deadpan approach that doesn't work well for subtlety or understatement in the context of a novel. His sense of evil is sincere, but lacks drama. I am sorry I spent the time with this book, and recommend that you don't bother with it."
3,Croatian Evil,"The real message of Mary must be to warn us and to remind us of the evil which befell the Medjugorije area just 50 years ago. In fact, her first apperance was 50 years to the day when several hundred Sernian women and children were led up the limestones hills by Croatian Nazis to be tossed alive into deep karst pits. These Croats, motivated by a deep religious zeal, killed in the name of the Catholic Church. Mary is here to remind us of that evil"
1,"""retold to make it easy, a negative star""","Be aware that this edition is ""retold"" in order to make it ""easy"".The words are not the author's and this editiondoesn't have all the chapters that are on the original book.Unfortunately these facts are not part of the product description."
5,"Birthday Party: ""Live '81-82"" CD","A good representation of the Birthday Party live (for those of us who weren't there). All songs are stellar versions, even those hard to imagine live (orchestral arrangement on ""Nick the Stripper"" is well-compensated by guitars). There are two never-before-released songs, both of which are great (esp. ""Pleasure Heads . . .""). And if you're still wondering about this album's merit, listen to their version of ""Funhouse"" (believe me, no matter what your expectations, it's better).If you want some visual to accompany the audio, seek out the live Birthday Party video ""Pleasure Heads Must Burn"" -- two shows (one with Phill Calvert on drums & the other with Mick Harvey replacing him) separated by the video for ""Nick the Stripper"" (shot in a city dump, the extras being inmates from a local insane asylum). Therein contains video to document the song ""Pleasure Heads . . ."", which could not have been done justice in the studio (a la the MC5's ""Black to Comm"")."
5,psychotic,"The birthday party have always been one of my favorite bands. This record is so intense. The version of ""KING INK"" is terrifying and the vocals are absolutely psychotic. Makes A. Vega's hoots and hollers seem tame, sane and sad. This band existed when alternative music really was alternative. Pick it up and worship its intensity."
4,Long Overdue,"I've been a potter for two decades and teaching for nearly as long. I've thought about writing this sort of book for all my first-timers who come through the door and am delighted that Ms. Enright beat me to the punch! She's done the job with insight into the essential soul of all would-be potters, and she's got style!"
3,"Plenty of equipment room, low on quality","This backpack has a ton of room for your camera, a handful of lenses and what not. I however, am just starting out, and have but an SLR and 2 lenses, and so the extra room in this bag equals unnecessary bulk for me (the bag is extremely bulky).The upper compartment is fairly small, but what can you expect, when you purchase a bag specifically designed to protect your camera equipment.I was disappointed in the quality of the straps and harnesses. From an adventure backpack standpoint, the harness system is poorly constructed, and uses cheap plastic. The bag itself, however, appears sturdy and handsome.I ultimately returned my bag, due to it's overwhelming bulk for my needs, and a broken plastic buckle on the waist strap assembly. (I ordered it refurbished, so the broken piece may be a result of poor inspection) I chose to go with the Lowepro 35091 Primus AW Premium Backpack."
5,Very well built product,"Very well built product. I can tell this will hold up. It's like a tank. I bought ""refurbished"" but I can't find any imperfections."
4,All Around Perfect!,There is plenty of room for my Sony Alpha and its 4 lenses. I also like how it can easily store my laptop with plenty of padding to keep it safe and accessories in the top pocket. The perfect all around backpack for laptops and cameras.
4,Great for a day trip.,"I bought this bag for my husband for the coming vacation. It's just perfect to hold the equipments, but not much room left for personal stuff. It's great for a day trip, but if you're expecting something you can carry for a long trip, it's not the one.The material is great, has lots of padded pockets for every accessories, and can hold a laptop securely."
3,Poor customer service for returns,Received the item promptly without problem but had difficulties trying to return the item when the person who received the gift didn't like it. It was nearly impossible to reach the company by phone which was required before sending the item back to the company. Finally got a response from the company by email after a few days. I doubt if we will order anything through this supplier again from Amazon.
4,"Great quality, great project",The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because NOTHING is perfect. This backpack/computer/camera case comes close though.
4,"nice design, I'm afraid it's a little too big for its actual capacity!","The bag is good if you are traveling not meant for a daily basis,i think the bag is too big, and plus you cant carry much in the upper pocket. I thought i could use it in a daily basis like going to school carry my books and my camera too, but no, the bag is too big to struggle with it everyday. Thou the size of the bag it is pretty comfortable to carry even if you have your laptop in it too. Definitely recommended for an excursion or something like that."
5,Awesome for traveling!,"When I travel I like to limit the camera gear I take with me. I just went to Alaska and brought: canon 40d, canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS with lens hood, canon 17-40mm f/4.0L with lens hood, canon 50mm f/1.8, 15.4"" dell laptop, 8gb memory card, 2 2gb memory cards, 1 1gb memory card, remote switch, a couple filters and a couple optech rain covers. Everything fit in this bag with ease and I was still able to throw my light coat into the top pocket.When I'd take it out hiking or around town I'd just leave my laptop back at the hotel locked in the safe and it was pretty light. Incredibly convenient.Tamrac offers straps to hold a tripod on the bottom for about $8 for a pack of two. They suck, don't get them. Figure out a way to engineer your own. They come loose too easily and will fall out. I've already lost mine. :("
4,Camera Backpack,"I bought this backpack for a trip to Africa. I was carrying a digital SLR camera and lenses. Obviously, I couldn't check those items. I bought the backpackto use as my carry on as well as in the field. It was very good as a carry on but a little big for the field. I don't really know the best solution for this type of dilemna. It is very good quality and has great slots for lenses, memory chips, etc."
4,Seriously constructed,This daypak style bag from Tamrac is built with all the right stuff. It is divided nicely to fit you camera gear and some other stuff-like a snack or whatever. The only thing I found not so perfect is I couldn't arrange the dividers to support my Canon 20D from moving around freely inside the bag. The bag is really designed for the larger camera bodies like the EOS 1D or Nikon D2x.
4,Great product,"Looks just like the picture, the quality of the material and the stiching is good. The only thing I would do is make the opening for the laptop a little larger. Other then that it is great and holds all the stuff I need to take with me in one bag."
5,Great product,"I am using this camera bag in the Fire Department and it has been great. It is well laid out, and well built. I would reccomend it for anyone trying to carry a computer and camera equipment."
4,Great Bag For International Travel,"We have had this bag now for approximately 3 years and have taken it with us to over 10 countries. We lug around 3 lenses, a DSLR, camcorder, compact digital camera, filters and sometimes (strapped to the outside) a tripod. This bag has held up quite well with no tears or rips. All zippers still work as new. No broken buckles. This bag also enables us to quickly slide our laptop in and out when going through security checks. The back straps and the 'sternum clip' are comfortable and make carrying these loads very pleasant. The bag also fits comfortably in the overhead bin of all the planes we traveled in and will even slide under the seat in front of you during some flights."
3,Traditional Christmas Classics,The album was advertised by The Music Store as being NEW AND SEALED.The album arrived with a cellophane wraper but there was no seal.The CD appears to be ok but I can't verify that it's NEW?John
1,"Hooks up at 54Mbps, gets hot.",The card has a transfer rate of 54Mbps with a Linksys WRT610 router. Not impressed. The card gets very hot and loses the wireless connection. I went back to my internal card on my Dell Inspiron 1501. Waste of money.
2,Does not work with Vista,"The internal wireless card failed on my HP laptop and I thought this PCIXpress card would be a less expensive option to replacing the HP OEM part.However, I could not get my system to recognize the card even with updated drivers that I downloaded from Belkins website. I am running Vista 64-bit but still no success when I tried to run it with either 32-bit or 64-bit drivers. I returned the item."
2,Card has worse reception than laptop built-in WiFi,"I bought this card to replace a Belkin card of same model that died in my laptop. I thought I needed new card, until I tried built-in Laptop WiFi during same day that I ordered the card. The built-in WiFi actually improved the signal reception between the laptop and the router over what I had experienced with the old Belkin card. The Amazon, vendor, Digitalet, is good, and provided a credit after I returned the Belkin card (un-opened) and documentation. The price for the card was good also, but the card apparently is not good because my built-in WiFi had noticably better reception than card, and still allowed me to connect through router and USB hub to the printer for printing. Recommend using your built-in WiFi (N Standard) rather than buy and use the card."
5,Great price for cards ability,"Purchased this card for a failed internal wireless (HP DV6000 series)and after my most current D-Link USB unit just died after 4+ years I purchased something on a budget...this was the best price for what I needed; the local stores had units for way too much and this fit exactly what I was looking to get...perfect fit into the express slot, reception is great from anywhere in the house, and the final thing I'd like to comment on is the compact size when it's installed into the slot. Great Price, can't be anymore pleased with this purchase."
1,Not compatible with windows 7!!!,"I bought this adapter a few days ago only to find out that is is not compatible with my PC running on Windows 7. review the compatibility with your current operating system before buying it because it seems that only works correctly with windows xp. I even called belkin and they dont take responsibility for issues of compatibility. The worst of all, it does not say anywhere in their website that this device does not work with windows 7. Be alert before buying it!!!!!!!!"
4,Its a good cheap card that works quickly and installs easily,"My father in laws HP laptop lost its built in card somehow. No matter what I did it would not work, figured it was toast. I also figured it would cost more than $100 to ship it off and get it fixed so decided to try this one because the linksys expresscard cost almost $100. This installed quickly on an XP laptop. The software started auto and installed quickly. Inserted the card and it was recognized and found my wireless network. Haven't checked throughput but it appears to be as fast as what I'm getting out of my Dell laptop with builtin wireless. Happy with the item. I am sure it will never come out of the laptop so the lacking case is no concern for me. I am not a great tech, but with this install anyone who can open the box could install the item. That means a lot."
1,Customer service is horrible,"This turned out to not fit the computer I bought it for. So I contacted the company to see about returning it. They said they could only do that if the package was unopened. So I asked them how I was supposed to find out it didn't fit without opening the package. This is a wifi card, not a game or something that I could copy. So after I leave a bad review I suddenly have a return code in my e-mail from them. Now it has been nearly a month since I returned the item. They still have not returned my money, or given me a credit, sent me an e-mail, I have not heard from them at all. I will never shop with Digitalet again."
3,"Too much Bernstein, not enough Mahler","I own every Bernstein Mahler recording but place this one pretty far down on the list. The Vienna Phil. plays gorgeously, and the engineers capture everything in super-bright, detailed sonics. I can remember what a blockbuster this produciton was in its day. But Bernstein underlines with heavy ink, barely letting a single bar of the music speak for itself. James King is a bluff tenor soloist, sounding too burly and not sensitive enough to the text. Fischer-Dieskau tries to outdo Bernstein by dramatizing every syllable with leaned-on emphasis but showing no natural lyricism or poetic surrender to Mahler's line.If you want the baritone version of this masterpiece, there is an excellent reading from Salonen on Sony with Bo Skovhus outsinging F-D by miles. An earlier, less exagerrated reading under Kletzki shows F-D off in better form for his many fans.Overall, a disappointment from a great Mahlerian."
3,Mostly Lenny!,"Bernstein famously identified with Mahler but, though he brings many insights into the composer, his supreme egomania gets in the way here.The baritone alternative works surprisingly well but the conductor can't resist infusing the whole work with his self-indulgent pulling and twisting and, at times, with his dripping sentimentality.Though this approach has its frequent rewards, I can't imagine, for myself, having to live with with such an overdone interpretation.Mahler has put enough emotion into his music without having more forced onto it."
4,missing a star for the sound,"This is a stupendous performance. I loved it - _after_ I fed the audio files into Audacity, added some reverb, spread out the stereo image, and adjusted the levels so that the places where the original engineers inexplicably faded in or out from the entire sound picture had been compensated for. Then I could hear the sound of Bernstein and the orchestra rather than the Decca ""sonic spectacular"". I don't normally do this kind of fiddling with the sound but this disc really needs it. I know it was the way things were done then, but it results in balances that were not intended by Mahler and interruptions to the melodic lines of the players and soloists, and to modern ears it is terribly annoying.That said, the other reviewers are right - it is a thrilling recording in every way, and I don't share the reservations about James King that some people have."
2,Pretty warped,"This movie about 5 nerds who create a sex tape of a drugged out female celebrityand then post it to the internet was pretty twisted. Kinda like a guilty pleasureas it did have some entertaining parts but the storyline was way over the top.I wasn't happy about the stereotypical depictions of women or men for that matter. Unlessyou like humor of the lowest common denominator, avoid it. If you like sex humormixed with some twisted values and warped excuse for morality, try it, you might, I repeatmight like it."
3,"This floss really is shred proof. However, it ...","This floss really is shred proof. However, it doesn't clean as well as some other brands. It slides very easily between teeth, but being so thin and flat, it doesn't remove as thoroughly. I'd recommend this floss to people whose teeth are very close together, but it wouldn't be the best choice for others."
3,Lantern Guide for EOS not illuminating,"While the guide is more useful than the included Canon instruction manual, it is a substandard users guide. Filled with marketing hype -- not enough practical examples of how each camera function works for my needs. No index (which in my book, is mandatory) makes the guide hard to use. A table that lists which features are avaialble in each mode would have been very useful and easy to do, but is not included. So, overall, three stars for trying -- and for adding to the meager user information provided by Canon."
1,spend your money on something else,not that helpful... u shouuld buy a photography book for the how to's not this one.
4,English life and love,"This was my first look at a book by Mary Sheepshanks. It was a great read-like a modern, humorous form of Jane Austen. The characters held my interest. It seems obvious that Sonia's devotion was more to the Dunstan manor than to her husband. Sonia , an artist and mother, seems quite selfish at times, not really trying to understand her husband, Archie, and he retaliates by having a brief affair. Neither of them seem to work very hard at repairing their marriage. Sonia's mother-in-law is obnoxious but fascinating. The author does an excellent job of describing the Dunstan children, who are lively and individual. I thought the ending was great, not really a surprise but satisfying.The author gives a tantalizing glimpse of life in an English manor house."
3,A Tortuous Read,"I am a huge fan of Rosamunde Pilcher, so I ordered this book upon her recommendation. I enjoyed the book after a fashion but it was laborious getting in to it and meeting all the characters and putting them in place. I would read books by Mary Sheepshanks in the future with hopes of a story that meandered a little less but Rosamunde Pilcher she is not."
4,Delightful fun,"Kirkus' review above is reasonably accurate in its description of the plot of this book, but is quite patronizing. Granted, it's not great literature, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.It reminds me of Joanna Trollope, Katie Fforde, and, a little, of Mary Wesley, though I don't think it quite as good as theirs. Can't always have the best, though, and this is definitely a good read.I wonder who Kirkus likes a lot?"
3,Disappointing book,"This book had its amusing scenes, but it was too predictable. I read the excerpts here and Rosamunde Pilcher's comments about the book and bought it because of those. I'm glad I bought the paperback edition."
4,Office Fun For Everyone!,"We have this in the office and it doesn't get old. Some people have gotten pretty creative with the types of noises they can make. You can really recreate many different types of farts with this stuff (long and slow, quick and sharp, etc...) Hillarity ensues!I doubt I would let my youngest son play with this, but for older kids and adults, it's a riot!"
3,flarp,"the container is too small for all the flarp, last time it was in a bigger container which made it work better"
5,excellent book .,"An eye opener, If you want to know the identity of the forces ruling the earth this is the book, the earth is truely given into the hands of the wicked.."
3,What the book is about,"I haven't read the book yet, but I got a description from one of the buyers, hope it helps:Follows the description from the back cover of this Regency Romance:""you are trying to fob me off. But I shall have you! I adore you!""Miss Alyssa Eliot's virtuous heart sank as she listened to the Marquesa of Stanwood's wild declaration. The silly moonling was but ninetten, and Alyssa, at five-and-twenty, was firmly on the shelf. Whatever would his fierce father, the Duke of Carlyle, do when he learned of such a mesalliance?Even so, no one could have predicted Carlyle's wrath--or Alyssa's strange attraction to him. Only thirty-six, and still smarting from his deceased wife's scandalous behavior, he was more than willing to brand Alyssa a scheming strumpet.He would teach her a lesson she would never forget...and learn one about love in the bargain."
1,THIS IS NOT FLASHDANCE! WHAT IS SO ABOUT IT?,This shirt is in no way Flashdance Material here. That Movie was released in 1983 and that featured torn (sweatshirts) shirts with their neck and all the elastic bands cut off as well. This shirt is a pretty shirt but a regular shirt with absolutely no reference to the movie.
1,I wish I could like this author,"Among the rest of the glowing reviews for Rick Riordan, I must be the in the definite minority--I just cannot get into his style. I've read (or tried to) his first two books and was mildly interested but not enough to finish them. And I am an avid mystery reader so this is unusual for me. Again with this latest book, I lost interest after about 100 pages. Maybe he's just not my style--I prefer Michael Connelly, Dennis LeHane, Robert Crais. Sorry, Rick. Keep your day job."
2,Was not happy,"I live in a basement where it tends to be damp/moist, unfortunately the steamer developed mold and had to get rid of it. You need to ensure it's dried before storing."
5,I would definitely recommend this product to friends ...,"I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family. This dental floss doesn't break or tear like other dental flosses do. Just like its name GLIDE, it glides right between your teeth for easy cleaning. I also used this product on my children's teeth and they preferred it to children's dental floss. The mint flavor is pleasant and not overbearing. It's very easy to use and I will continue using this product."
2,I have been using the dental floss for ...,"I have been using the dental floss for awhile now and have found it to be very slippery. I feel that it's hard to keep around my fingers, it slides off. If I use a longer piece, it tends to tighten around my fingers. I also feel that it glides through my teeth too easily. I don't feel that I would recommend it to family or friends."
5,My family liked this product. We liked how ...,"My family liked this product. We liked how easy the floss glided between our teeth. It had a nice hint of mint that wasn't overwhelming, but gave it a nice taste. We would definitely buy this product. I would recommend it to family and friends."
3,This dental floss lived up to its name. ...,"This dental floss lived up to its name. It did """"glide,"""" but it was a little too slippery. I found it difficult to control as I was flossing. On the positive side, the flavor was fine and it was better than some other flosses I've tried that don't easily slide between your teeth. This still didn't live up to my regular product, Johnson and Johnson."
4,Almost a perfect fit for our Fast Feed 76023-510.,"We own an Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Trimmer, but the combs that came with it have not lasted that long. I tried to find combs for the specific model that we had, but they were all much more expensive sets, so I took a gamble with this set to see how it would work. The only difference in the combs are three plastic lines on the underside of each that raises the comb up to high to slide onto the trimmer. With a razor knife I was able to remove the three lines easily and the combs fit perfectly. The best part was that I saved myself a bunch of money."
3,Doesn't Fit My Oster,"Bought this for my Oster 76, not realizing it doesn't fit. Oops. Can't blame these guys... they clearly state that what models the guides fit. Amazon, however, pulled this item up when I searched ""Oster 76 Guides"" - my fault for not reading the description to verify, and trusting Amazon's search results. :)3 stars because I don't want my review to be positive or negative (I haven't actually used them). I just want to warn other 76 owners who may end up here like I did."
2,clippers,They are too cheapily made and did not work very well on my oster clippers. not recommended for professional work
1,Doesn't fit,"Not worth the money, invest in metal clips, way more life to them and they wont break our pop off mid cut"
1,not as advertised,They claimed to be a universal clipper set for Oster hair clippers. Funny that they don't fit on my Oster.
3,Got the blender I wanted,"Only needed one item of the group, but had to purchase the whole kit. Easy to order, got fast and pretty good buy for the money."
5,The Family That Works Together,"I've owned and used this book since it was first written. It's subtitle is: ""Turning Family Chores from Drudgery to Fun"". I've lent it to many of my counselling clients and it has been very helpful when attempting to increase family co-operation. 10 chapters cover a multitude of helpful, encouraging ideas in clear, concise language. Topics include managing money and handling allowance; maintaining co-operation with teens;implementing 8 practical pointers to accelerate Change; developing an encouraging style, etc. It is especially useful for families who struggle with the old-fashioned (way they were brought up) methods of demanding obedience. 10 chapters cover a multitude of helpful, encouraging ideas in clear, concise language. Topics include managing money and handling allowance; maintaining co-operation with teens;implementing 8 practical pointers to accelerate change; developing an encouraging style, etc."
3,Worrisome,"This book does have good advice, but is way too negative. It emphasises how quickly you can ruin your dog for life, which isn't what a new puppy owner needs to hear. And if you have gotten your puppy before reading the sections on choosing a puppy and breeder you will feel doomed perhaps. I think the Power of Positive Dog Training is much better. Having a puppy and working with it should be a joy not an overly anxious experience."
4,Good Information for New Dog Owners,"My husband and I are becoming puppy parents in a few weeks, I've worked with dogs before, he hasn't. I was looking for a book that would have some practical advice on how to prepare for our pups arrival and how to train our puppy to grow into a well behaved adult dog. This book offers practical, common sense advice and also gives some tips that one would only get from a professional trainer. The book is repetitive at times, but I believe that is done to help drive home a point. It is organized into very helpful chapters that align with the developmental stages of your puppy and is focused as much on training dog owners as it is on training dogs. The ""deadlines"" provided are really guidelines and let you as an owner know what the critical points are in training a dog, but just like kids, all puppies are different, so you need to do what works for your dog. I've already marked important pages and anticipate looking back to this book often as I work with my new pup!"
3,Before and after getting your puppy,Book was interesting with a different approach than I would have expected. Will pick and choose to meet my goals with what works best for me. I would say it was definitly worth buying. This book was recommended by the breeder I got my girls from.
3,traditional fundamentals in an unpleasant tone,"Very happy I checked this book out from the library before buying it (now I won't make that purchase). This book teaches traditional fundamentals, but leaves no room for variations or individualization. If you have no help (or a trainer) and know nothing about puppies, this is a great jumping off point. Some of the author's warnings may seem impossible and dire, but if you take it with a grain of salt and follow the concepts, you should be just fine. If you're familiar with the expression ""he wrote the book"", then this is ""the book"". That said, it is such accepted knowledge that you can definitely find other books with a kinder tone that present the information in a more flexible format."
1,Too Condescending,"I read the reviews for this book that it was really condescending, but my breeder had recommended it and I thought, I'm a big girl, I can take it. Well, this book was over the top. I actually could not finish it. I felt like I was being yelled at non-stop. While his methods are fine, the overall tone was to me, unacceptable. I read 4 puppy books in all and would recommend all of the other three: The Art of Raising a Puppy, by the New Skete Monks, How to Raise the Perfect Dog through Puppyhood and Beyond, by Cesar Millan, and Imagine Life with a Well-Behaved Dog, by Julie Bjelland. I would definitely skip this one as there are so many other great puppy books our there."
4,Well worth the effort to Read,"One of the better books I've read on training. Most of the ideas presented are very good, although the average person will have a difficult time fully adhering to some of his suggestions. There's a little too much ""My approach will work every time."" My experience is that dogs are a little like people in that they have their own personality, and what works with one will not necessarily work with another. These are really small ""complaints"" and most of the book provides very practical and good approaches to training your dog."
1,Antiquated Attitude,"This book is terrible! Don't waste your money. Dr. Dunbar repeats himself by telling the reader what should be accomplished without ever really describing how. My all-time favorite part of the book is when Dr. Dunbar suggests socializing your puppy by introducing him to 100 people ... and that the reader can accomplish this easily by inviting male friends over to watch sports on TV; and female friends should be invited over for chocolate. Dear Dr. Dunbar, I can only assume that your dog-rearing skills are as antiquated as your social skills. And in case you haven't noticed, the 1960s were half a century ago."
1,I've read 40 pages of this book...,"I had to stop reading this terrible book. Dunbar is sooooo negative. I wanted a ""positive"" approach to raising a happy healthy puppy as titled in the book. I'm not new to dog ownership, but I have not had a puppy for a few years and wanted some current advice and I feel that I regressed after reading 40 pages.I had to stop reading this book because I felt that I would never succeed. I do not have 100 friends to come to my house to meet my new puppy, I will not hand feed my puppy ALL meals- is he crazy? I am not going to purchase a Kong for each hour of the day, the ""errorless house training"" is full of errors.Dunbar made me feel like I am destined to fail if I don't follow all of his steps. I will mess up in training, and if I do I will ""ruin"" the dog and make him ""educationally retarded.""I'm sorry I wasted money on this book."
3,It's ok...,Very strict philosophy on dog training. I'm all about a well-trained dog but you have to take this author's methods with a grain of salt.
1,"too authoritarian, don't waste your time.","I found the author to be very authoritarian in his view and advice. I got the sense that it was all or nothing. That if you failed to do one of his recommendations or do it at the wrong time, that you were doomed to have a puppy that would become a great problem later. Also advice such as take two weeks off of work to work with the puppy once you had brought them home is beyond the pail, especially given the current economic times. Do not waste you time with this book. Go get one of Ceasar Milan's books, you will be better off."
5,I wasn't sure...but it is really working,"This book was great! I got it before I got the dog and read/followed it carefully. Not everything in book worked exactly as Dunbar predicted (my puppy wasn't very food motivated). But I stuck with it. Just 2 months later, we're potty trained, listening to basic commands, and happy being left alone. Really recommended, just stick to the plan he sets out!"
3,A bit overwhelming,"This book made me feel a bit overwhelmed. It has been a while since I had a puppy and a dog trainer recommended this book. Dr. Dunbar says you need your puppy to do so many things before the puppy is three to four months old ( ex. Introduce the puppy to 100 people before its three months old ). My puppy was two months old. To make myself less overwhelmed I'm taking one thing at a time and as for the people, there trickling in. I think he means well, he just comes across the wrong way."
4,Some good advice...,"We are getting ready to get a new puppy and thought this book would help us prepare for that journey. While I do agree with the thought that some of the ideas are a bit unrealistic, like introducing your dog to 100 other dogs in the first month, I also found this book to be insightful and helpful. I do not read it as ""do this or your dog will be a nightmare"", but more as guidance and incorporating as much as we feel necessary. This is in addition to classes and other training manuals.It is a well written, short book. I feel it will be helpful to have as a reference as any subject is easily found."
3,Rigid and unrealistic,"I eagerly bought this book based on the glowing reviews. While the basic philosophy behind the book -- humane training -- is a desirable one, I found that Dr. Dunbar's approach is extremely rigid and unforgiving. He advocates ""errorless chewtoy and house training."" As anyone who has trained a puppy knows, there is no such thing as ""errorless"" training, and the expectation is unrealistic. The tone of the book is often patronizing and off-putting. If you are interested in this book, I recommend reading several other training books to temper the rigid advice."
5,It doesn't take synths to be ambient,"While the category of ambient music nearly always involves electronics, Bruce Kaphan has created a new kind of ambient with his steel guitar. The album's subtitle is ""Ambient Excursions for Pedal Steel Guitar,"" and that says it all. The steel guitar is used to make nearly all the music on the CD, but not in a style typically associated with that instrument. A track such as ""Outpost"" is as spacious (and space-y) as anything by Eno or Serrie. The effect of listening to the piece is like quietly floating high above a calm but endless sea; utter serenity. The CD is not just a homogenous block of spacey atmospheres, however. Kaphan mixes it up with oriental or near eastern textures on some cuts, and also begins ""Back to the Light"" with a techno-ish swirl of grungy, chopped-up backwards guitar loops. ""Slider"" is a highly intriguing disc that I will undoubtedly return to many times in the future."
3,Slip sliding away,"The more ambient tracks on this album seem to work for me. The first couple tracks seem to meander. If you like this stuff, search out some of Ry Cooder's soundtrack work, specifically the Johnny Handsome ST. As well some of the work of Michael Brook."
1,bad design,"Pro: the burning air from the laptop is good for warming hands in cold winter.Con:dark screenSince I bought this laptop, I swear I will never buy any product of Dell. There is no manual in the shipping box. There is no built-in microphone on my D410."
2,Tarnished People,"I think Heffernan may be a capable writer. He, perhaps, captures the language and actions of the usual police department in any given city. However, he seems to enjoy burying his readers in lots of f'ing profanity every other f'ng word. Also, the disgusting diatribe about gays and lesbians is way over the top. This is the second of his I've read and it will be the last. For those who enjoy down and dirty police stories, you will like this one. It doesn't get more down and dirty than Tarnished Blue."
4,Good Group!,"This CD is pretty good. I love all the songs on it and I especially like the Inspector Gadget song (the movie's good too!). I have to agree with most everyone else, this is a great new boy band!"
2,LET'S ROLL?-I'M STILL WAITING....,"Like a picture that fades as it's copied over & over again, so do these ""boy bands.""LFO & Youngstown are examples of this.Unlike the originals (Backstreet Boys, N'Sync), Youngstown is just a faded copy. Largely a Disney created, or at least promoted, band the only catchy tunes on this CD are indeed the themes from Inspector Gadget, Genius & Jett Jackson.The only other hooky tune is Don't Worry. The rest of the Cd sounds like leftover,boring,filler songs that were recorded by BSB or N'Sync & never made the cut. Let's Roll? I'm still waiting...."
5,The next best boy band. . . . . has arrived!,"So far, I've heard 2 of Youngstown's songs-""I'll Be Your Everything"" and ""The Prince You charmed"" and both of them are surprisingly very good! I've heard ""I'll Be Your Everything"" from the movie ""Inspector Gadget"" and I've heard ""The Prince You Charmed"" from the Disney Channel Original Movie, ""Genius"". Youngstown is the best new boy band after the Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, and LFO (I hate 'N Sync 'cause they copy Backstreet Boys and are Backstreet Boys Wannabees so I don't consider them one of the best boy bands....) and I think they should be given a lot of credit and support! So, if you like BSB, 98 Degrees, LFO, and (I feel really sorry for you but also 'N Sync) then you'll love Youngstown! I can gaurentee you 100% that as soon as you can buy this CD, that you definitely will!P.S.: Don't forget to catch the Disney Channel Original Movie ""Genius"", 'cause it's the best! Also, you'll love the movie, ""Inspector Gadget""!"
1,Why did I buy this? Why?,"I think I was temporarily insane when I got this. There are only two songs that are worth listening to on here--""Pedal to the Steel"" and ""I'll Be Your Everything"". Those songs are the reason I bought this CD and now they're the only ones I listen to. The rest is just mindless, stupid, poppy trash. Don't get me wrong, I love pop music. I have CDs from *NSync, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore and lots of others that I like a lot but Y-town doesn't have the writing and the hooks that they need to keep audiences happy. There's just no originality. Hopefully their second CD coming out in August will be more entertaining, better written, and more cutting edge. Love~Butterfly"
4,Their not my everything....but close,"The 3 guys that make up Youngstown (DC, Dallas and Sammy) put together a pretty good debut cd. The number one hit, I'LL BE YOUR EVERYTHING, from the movie ""Inspector Gadget"", came across as a great hit. They have great harmonies and sound. They did show off some more of their talent by writing a couple of tracks, so that was great to see. As I usually say I like it when the artist do at least some of the writing. Other tracks worth mentioning are PETAL TO THE STEEL and IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. The guys sound great together. There is some rapping on the cd, not my thing, but not worth giving a bad rating. And they look good on the cd cover as well! Let's see what they have planned for their sophomore production."
1,IT STINKS,"that inspector gadget song is soooo stupid ""if you want it automatic, just call out go go gadget?"" oh please! If you want a good boy band, buy 5ive or n sync. Please stay away from this group!!!!!!"
5,A great addition to your toy box,Silicone cleans easily is super slick with just a little water based lube goes in easy and is a real pleaser.I only buy silicone toys/dildi's now AAA+++
3,"Wimpy board, especially if your sink is large.","I do have an oversize sink, I like this style; had a wooden one for years that finally gave up the ghost. The board is OK on a flat surface, but over the sink it flexes so, that I wouldn't trust it for cutting anything harder or heavier than a ripe pear, with a sharp knife. I do use it to seed, peel, and chop tomatoes, where the over-the-sink idea is especially helpful. Bigger and thicker would have been better."
5,Monomax shocks and struts,"I installed the KYB Monomax struts and shocks, along with a Daystar 1"" spacer lift in the front and Fabtech 1.5"" add-a-leafs in the rear on my 2002 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab 4x4. I am very happy with the ride. Very controlled. I notice no harshness at all."
1,What a waste of money!,"I can't believe this is actually a Baby Jogger product - one would think they'd make a drink holder that doesn't interfere with the seat positioning! You cannot use this holder with the City Select seat in the forward-facing position - the ""knob"" on the inside blocks you from re-positioning the seat. A complete waste of money."
1,waste of money,"It fit my City Mini 2011, but the only position it worked in was sticking way off to the side in an obnoxious way. I was super excited to use my cup holder for my Starbucks latte, but it spilled everywhere just walking out the door. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,It really DOES NOT fit the city select,"I purchased it and tried everything, even the suggestions from some reviewers. IT WILL NOT FIT! I looked it up on the Baby Jogger web site and of course in cursive at the bottom of the description it states ""*The Universal Liquid Holster will not fit the City Select, City Select users should order the City Select Liquid Holster""."
1,NOT for Baby Jogger City Selct,Beware that this product does not fit the Baby Jogger City Select as it is the only one with a square instead of a round handlebar.
4,Holds drinks well for us caffeine addicts,Holds drinks well. Though coffee drinks still slosh out of the opening if full; but as expected with any holder if on the move. Only one that is adaptable for any stroller. Used same one for three different strollers thru the years. Cannot be without it!
4,Works as designed,"This product works well when attached. As you move the stroller handle up and down your drink stays level. The holster is big enough for a 20oz bottle, don't think you are going to be able to fit a large nalgene bottle in this thing.If you are using this on a baby jogger, make sure you remove it (has a quick release so you don't have to unscrew the whole thing) before folding it up. This think sticks out on the side and will break easily even if you are being extra careful with lugging your stroller in and out of your car. It isn't hard to do."
1,the bugaboo cup holder works for the city select.,praise be: the bugaboo cup holder (with the largest clip attached) works perfectly on the city select. skip this one.
1,Not for us...,"If you like this style of cup holder than you should like this. It seems very sturdy, like it would hold up well. We are not fans of this style but bought it just to be sure and compare to the Sunshine Kids and the other style Baby Jogger called the 'parent console'. Both of those attach and hang between the handles. We prefer the parent console. It looks like it belongs on the stroller. Doesn't dangle off and seem ready to break. We like that you can use one parent console style for 2 cups and still have a velcro storage area. You can also just have one cup and 2 velcroed storage areas. Stoller still collapses easily with console attached."
2,Not sturdy enought,Loved the idea but not the hassle. It needs to be adjusted constantly and more often than not I end up placing my drink somwhere else.
1,Not worth it,"This is was a waste of money for me, I have the Citi Select double stroller and the cup did not attach over the bar that had rubber but had to be on the metal so was in the way of the second seat. Every time I folded my citi select double stoller the cup holder would get in the way and then it broke - what a waste of money. The design was desfinately not though through and not for the Citi Select Double Stoller."
1,Absolutely does NOT fit the City Select,"After reading the reviews for this cup holder, I decided that the folks who said this did not work on their City Select were probably not reading the instructions correctly. After all, other owners reported it worked just fine. Well, it just doesn't work!! The handlebar is TOO wide to attach the holder. I have no idea how anyone with the City Select that I purchased got this holder to work. Perhaps there is a different model with a thinner handle bar - this is the model that I have: Baby Jogger 2011 City Select Single Stroller. Please don't waste you time and money ordering this cup holder if you have this stroller."
3,"Not for Phil & Teds, Yes for Maclaren","This cupholder did not fit around the tubing on the handlebar of our Phil & Teds Dash stroller. The opening is too narrow on the cupholder for the handlebar on the stroller--for the square sectrion and to try to wrap around the foam on the handle. We did not try to remove the foam covering on the handlebar, but the bar does appear to be thinner underneat the foam section. We tried to push back the foam covering, but were unable to push back enough of it to accommodate this item. We could not wrap the cupholder around the foam as that was also too wide.It did fit easily on the handles of the Maclaren Quest. It is wrapped around the foam on that stroller, and we expect that there will be an indent after some time if we leave it on. And, we're able to folder the stroller with the cupholder attached."
5,i love it,"The baby jogger have very good quality and i trust they.i know they made in china,but that`s america standard!thank you!!"
2,Doesn't fit on a Maclaren Quest,"I'm sure I would love this cup holder if it fit on my stroller, but I read the reviews that said it would fit on a Maclaren, and it certainly didn't fit on mine. Maybe our model is different. We have a Maclaren Quest, so just FYI for those that own that model. This is not the cup holder for you."
5,Excellent resource and guide to a functional intuitive skill,"Since I helped to write, edit and prepare the books I am somewhat biased. However, in this book you will discover how those ""feelings"" that often guide your decision making can be identified, developed to become and incredibly useful skill in both decision making and the creative process. Dr. Emery's ""students"" include some of the country's top executives and business leaders. Easy to use and follow."
2,"amazing content, but too many errors","I agree completely with the reader from Ithaca. The last timeI used it for something important, there was a serious typo in aformula, and much time was wasted."
2,Too many typos,"I agree with two other reviewers R. Meyer and ""A Customer"". This book has too many typos. I just read a few pages in Chapter 15, and find quite a number of typos. For example on page 261, below section 3 heading, \mu=d/\lambda should be v=d/\mu. In Eq.(15.4d), inside exp[], the number 2 below the first \lambda should be deleted, and IG(\alpha^2/2, \lambda) should be corrected as IG(1/\sqrt{2\alpha}, \lambda). I'm disappointed that there are so many typos. It will be better if the authors could at least provide an errata online. But I don't find such an errata."
4,It's Not Harder for WP,"Wilson Pickett has lost nothing since he ""found a love"" with the Falcons! His new tracks have the intensity and tight arrangements that made his a soul superstar in the '60's. This man still has it and he doesn't spare it in this CD. Well worth getting - I only wish it had been longer."
4,Classic Artist meets Great Producer,"In true, raw Soul, you can go ""home again"" - if the singer keeps to his roots, has good lyrics, a good studio, a good mix, real musicians playing real instruments in real time. Mr. John Tiven even provides guitar and organ (and wrote some here too).Also on the scene to help make it work are historic names like Don Covay and Dan Penn.The title song sounds every bit as fresh as any *released* material from the '60s or '70s from WP; ""Soul Survivor"" is another cut that could have made-the-cut on any of the early albums.Pickett himself is co-composer on *five* tracks, and there are no tentative fillers, either. Some songs imply that the star is willing to offer painful, confessional reflections, no holds barred - he admits to playing rough with players willing to play dirty.OLdies But Goodies are great - witness Wilson in ""Blues Brothers 2000"" - but what a gift this is to record collectors - and any other fans of gritty, corporeal Soul."
2,"It's the songs, not the singer",Wilson sounds every bit as hard and soulful as he always did. This album is remarkable in that there's not one memorable song (or even a hook) on the entire thing. A real bummer.
4,looking for something more interesting then commercial radio,"this, like most of the lilys previous albums is something more than a common cd. it's full blown entertainment. it is extremely uncommon for me to actually play an album more then five times. i don't understand why commerical radio chooses to force monotonous, muddy sounding music down our throats, when there is brilliance around the corner. favorite tracks are ""and one"" and ""socs hip""."
2,Starved for music?,"I must confess to not understanding this. Why don't you go buy records by the Kinks, the Zombies, and the first six or 8 Who records? They do this, all of this, and they do it much better, and it sounds real--not like some late 90's pop experiment."
4,Its the lilys man,"As a follow up to Better Can't Make Your Life Better - it seems like everyone, myself included, expected huge things from Kurt and Co. Unfortunately, they got an album that was a strong as its predecessors but quickly fell to the wayside as Sire refused to market it. A lost gem of an indie rock album, its worth a try for those who were into the Apples in Stereo and Asteroid #4 sixties pop of the nineties. Some of the better songs on the album include - Leo Ryan (our pharoah's slave) and Dimes make Dollars. While not as inspiring as its predecessor - it runs longer and takes its time. A pleasant listen that likes to give more than receive - its worth checking out before you buy that Beachwood Sparks album you've been thinking about buying."
4,Lilys near the top,"I admit to an initial moment of disappointment with this disc, which is not as astonishing as ""Better Can't Make Your Life Better"". And yet, it's still great to have - the riffs out of nowhere, the rapid shifts in tempo and mood, etc. I take back all the bad things I've said about Hartford..."
2,Hamlin Violin,"I purchased this violin for my wife, an adult over 50 and we have no children left at home. The children are married or off to college and do not live close by. I stated this because I didn't want anyone to think that some child was messing with this violin.The violin has trouble keeping tuned. Also the bow cracked before my wife had a chance to use it. She is taking lessons from an elderly lady who has complained about the violin strings becoming loose too easily.I would highly recommend looking for another product."
4,Heads Hands & Feet do 2 songs here (film is also known as THE HERO),"I've not seen the film, but the soundtrack features two swell tracks by Heads Hands & Feet: ""Homing In On The Next Trade Wind"" and ""Hail The Conquering Hero"", both written by Tony Colton and Ray Smith. Both sides were issued on the US Capitol soundtrack LP AND on a Capitol 45!Rather good music by Johnny Harris....but these two Heads Hands & Feet makes this a worthwhile purchase.As of 2006, these two tracks are the only ones currently available, as all of the other Heads Hands & Feet CDs are out of print."
4,Bonney is wonderful -- everything else falls slightly short,"Pergolesi's Stabat Mater is truly one of the greatest ever written and these artists are really top-notch. I recommend this CD because Barbara Bonney is really wonderful in it. And Rousset's interpretation is very smooth, layered orchestral textures against the voices. I'm glad I have it. However, against Bonney's strong, pure sound and mostly perfect intonation, the orchestra does sound flaccid at times, and Andreas Scholl's remarkably beautiful voice is unable to mask slightly flat intonation. That can be annoying but otherwise it's a great early instruments recording."
5,"Marcia, Owls Head NY","Doesn't get much better than Tebaldi, Bergonzi and Von Karajan---I can't stop listening to this recording ! I think it is magnificent ! There may be ""better"" but not for me---I thought this was wondrous !"
2,A nice picture book,"TRAIN OF THOUGHTSDesigning The Effective Web ExperienceAUTHOR: John C. Lenker, Jr.PUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesThis book is not what the title lead me to believe it was about. I thought it would be a ""show-and-tell"" of how to design a better web site. It might even have been about how to improve on some effects you already were using.Rather it is a colorful picture book of dry discussions on what should and shouldn't be done in a web site. There are no step-by-step instructions on how to do these suggestions, no ""show-and-tell"", no CD with files to help you walk through the ideas, just small print and lots of pictures.Train of Thoughts reminds me of a very dry college text that is all talk and no show."
3,Interesting but over designed,"This book is not one that is easily read. The pages are heavily designed graphic design treats, but the text and the messages play second fiddle to the layouts, distracting full color background images, and other visually focused entertainments and explorations. This book perhpas makes for a coffee table book, or a book to flip through to find ocassional inspiration, but not much more. The written ideas are lost in the visuals."
4,great sign,"This sign is so cute and just has a nice humor to it. The only thing I was disappointed about was the size. I thought it would be bigger, but it still looks great and ended up being the perfect size for where I put it."
4,Great!,The disc works great. Inexpensive and it came in the mail rather quickly. Happy with our purchase. Would recommend to anyone!
2,The only memory stick I've ever had problems with,This card worked fine for several months but now it displays file errors on about 20% of the pictures I take (and of course won't display them). This is the only card I've ever had that I've had any issues with. Since I can't really trust it for important pictures I've gone back to an older smaller card.
5,Review:SanDisk 2 GB MemoryStick Pro Duo,"it is a good one, I think it is working fine as of now, I need to compare the access speed and usage speed. As of now it solves my purpose and it is good."
1,Slow delivery,"Product is nice. Even though I selected 3-5 days delivery and paid for it, the product is delivered after that."
5,"Excellent Product, Great Price...","I got this one for a great price, had really good shipping time, even was ordered before Christmas and got really well to the destination.Excellent product, nuff to say."
2,Perfect For Your PS2!,Bought it as a X-mas gift for my son and he absolutely loves it! He's downloaded more than 350 songs on it already! It was on sale here for a killer price for 2GB of memory which would run you close to $100 at a local store.
4,Okay,"The stick works fine, but it doesn't come with an adapter like the description says. This is really annoying, as it makes downloading to my PSP a lot harder than it could be.Still, I would reccomend this, as it is an affordable way to get a big card for whatever device you're using."
5,Good storage for my pictures,"I take photographs immensely, and so this was the perfect size of a memory chip for me whenever I travel. I do not need to change my chip mid-way, and it is compatible for my computer as well. Good value for my money."
2,Deceptive picture makes you think adapter is included,"I too am disappointed that the adapter is not included. The picture of the item shows the retail package including an adapter. A careful reading of the description of the item reveals a reference to the ""optional adapter"" so I guess this is Amazon's escape clause. I consider the picture, being of a different item, to be deceptive."
4,great product for the right price,worked well with my sony digicam and also with my psp!its the next best thing from sony's own!i always have good faith with scandisk and it had never let me down!
3,Item not as advertised...,"as others have mentioned, amazon has misrepresented the product by sending the ""gaming"" version of sandisk's duo media. actual product shipped doesn't come with an adapter and looks distinguishingly different from the picture. the 3 stars is for having to ship the item back for a refund. sandisk's media normally deserves 5 stars for its speed (faster than Sony's pro duo media) and reliability. but i can't accurately rate this product because i never opened package."
2,Not as described,"a little disapointed when this arrived in just a zip lock bag, when it says it was in retail package in the description. Still the right part though, but all in all not how I had expected to get my order when others were available and i chose this one since it was ""new in package"""
4,Doing Good,"Memory Stick is working fine.Delivery is perfect,that means received within the mentioned delivery date."
5,excellent service,received item much quicker than expected and have had not one problem. Great gift for my son and great price.
1,Incorrect Product Description,"I ordered this product for my brand new Sony Cybershot DSC-P200, which uses memory sticks (full size). I did this because it said:* Adaptor included* Compatible to all MS PRO devices with the use of the AdaptorWow, there is no adapter in the package, just a plastic case and the memory card. So I can't use it till I go buy a new one. Thanks guys."
3,Pay attention to the details,Please be advised - one of the pictures is not accurate. This item DOES NOT include the adapter.
3,Adapter NOT included!!,"Just so everyone is clear on this: The adapter for this is NOT included. One of the pics shows it as being included in the package, but this is false. Also, a reviewer from 2006 said the adapter is included, but it's not anymore (says so in the description too). the adapter is absolutely needed to operate it in a digital camera."
5,SanDisk 2 GB Memory Stick,My son loves the memory stick. He plays an online game everyday on his PSP and this card allows him the space and speed he needs. Thank you.
3,Memory stick,I bought this cause I needed it. It works as it was supposed to. I haven't had any issues with it.
1,No Adapter Including - Wrong Product Shipped.,"We bought the Regular SanDisk 2GB Memory Stick PRO Duo WITH THE ADAPTOR, but Amazon shipped us the ""Gaming version for Sony PSP"" WITHOUT THE ADAPTOR and this is completely useless for use in our Sony Digital Camera and Sony Camcorder.Calling Amazon Customer Service did not help.Trying to see if SanDisk can help us.Very disappointing and frustrating."
3,"Ordered 2,Only 1 works...?","I ordered 2 of the cards to go into PSP's I bought as Christmas gifts,they arrive today but only 1 works the other says error I tried to format it still doesn't work.1 works fine,I guess the 2nd is defective? I really need these cards for the psp's I bought my nephews....."
5,Great for PSP,"A couple of things to clear up about the item. First, the adaptor WAS included with my order (part of the package). Second, Sandisk duo sticks have faster transfer rates than the Sony sticks (even their high-speed line). The price can't be beat and although I selected the ""super-saver"" shipping (free) the item arrived within 3 days! Super cool.For those of you utilizing your PSP to the fullest, it's a great thing to step up your storage to 2gb and this is the one to get. It wasn't too long ago that the 1gb sticks were at this price. Double your storage, double the fun."
5,2 GB MemoryStick Pro Duo,"I bought this for PSP use and it works fine. The PSP doesn't really need a ""Gaming"" MemoryStick... I bought two of these and went to the ""Format Memory"" option on the PSP and it works as if it where a gaming one.I also used one of them on my Sony DCR-HC85 Video Camera and it holds up to 1,000+ pictures. Great deal for the price.*****"
4,Reliable,"This is a great memory stick. However, it does not work in a Sony adapter to make it work in a regular size memory stick port. Other than that this product works well."
5,Great Product with A Great Price,"My grandson loved this; it was just want he wanted and it holdes so much stuff....ie movies, songs, games. I loved the price. Great price for all you get."
5,Trust SanDisk,I bought this memory stick for my Sony Ericsson W810i. Gives me enough space for pics & music. Thats what i wanted. Haven't encountered any problems as yet.
5,Works great,No problems with it. Upgraded from the 1 gb Sandisk and have never had a problem with their products.
5,perfect for traveling,"I maintain an overnight bag in my car for emergencies and unexpected events (no I was not a boy scout). These tooth brushes are small enough to fit in the little bag, include a cover for the bristles to keep them clean and undented, and extend to be a traditional size brush. I have recommended them to many people to use similarly."
2,Huge,"This toothbrush is about three times as large as my previous travel toothbrush that I'm trying to replace. Not compact at all. When folded, measures 4-1/4 x 1-1/8 x 3/4"", which is more than the space taken by a typical full-size, non-travel toothbrush."
3,"Some solid music, worth buying.","This is a dope cd. A nice mixture of styles and beats. I saw LMNO's name on it and bought it automatically, but there are plenty of tight songs from the other fellas. If you like M.T.V. style music, this isn't for you. This is some dope aboveground stuff."
5,Relevant,"This book helped me break out from the robotic way of Christian living to truly discovering who and what God is all about. It being written in a standard, non-fancy vocabulary, for me, is a plus."
2,Use with Caution.....,"Unless you're a bookkeeper geek, Peachtree is not something you can do alone. For those who enjoy bookkeeping and have assistance from a some-time Accountant, it is sufficiently flexible to handle your needs. It's not cheap and to evaluate properly consider: training, 3rd party charges and Best Software nickel and diming you for every little thing. For example, this upgrade is totally unnecessary, except to obsolete their earlier versions. One finds very little changing and what does change, is unimpressive -- most items on the above feature list are not new."
1,Full of Bugs and Slow,We are forced here to give it one star - The program deserves NONE!We couldn't agree more with the comments below. The product isextremely unreliable and slow. We have been struggling with this for several years now and the last upgrade seemed to have made things even worse. We will have to look for another program.Not recommended
2,"Not bad, but there are better alternatives","Peachtree is ok, but I do not recommend it for several reasons:1. It has a very old interface. Make you tired and bored after a while!2. Very complex. For example, you have to type 10.00, instead of just 10!3. Old technology: Now we are in 2005 not in 1990!And other thing I did not like.I would personally recommend Small Business Manager (SBM) from Microsoft http://www.microosft.com or another alternative and less expensive is Quick Business Manager (QBM) from Business Aim http://www.bisaim.com. There other software I could recommend but it seems that these two are really using great technologies such as Microsoft .Net and SQL Server. Good Luck."
1,"Hard Har Har, Very complex!","We are not in an industrial age any more! We want better software, much easier to use, and better interface. Why Peachtree is that hard? Remember DOS? How hard it was when Windows came about? Now peachtree is like that if you have used better software: Old tech."
1,Tricked,Ordered Peachtree 2005 Complete accounting and received a replacement disk that you can't register therefor the product is useless. There was nothing in the ad that stated this was a replacemnet disk. False advertisement on their part I do believe. I would not suggest buying from this company.
3,Not his best,"I found it hard to sympathize with the stupidity of the main character here.Good book in parts, but a touch of the ""Mills and Boone"" in many places.I found the author's ""Past Caring"" much more to my liking."
1,Interesting plot but amateurish dialogue,"I must admit I was intrigued by the plot synopsis on the back cover of this novel but I couldn't take it seriously after reading some of the awful and sometimes hilarious dialogue. I even read it out to my family and some friends (Try it with a Noel Coward accent!!) and brought tears of laughter. I couldn't read past the second chapter. If you see it, read the synopsis, ponder at what might have been then leave off reading for a while!!"
3,A Shaggy Dog Story,"This was a wonderful book up until the last section where it seemed as if the author had written himself into a corner. It was almost as if someone else, someone in a hurry to be done with it all, had finished the story. The cleverness and imaginativeness of the rest of the book were swept unconvincingly aside leaving the reader feeling cheated for having been carried along only to find that the author apparently grew bored or unable to explain what he had so masterfully begun. He halfheartedly answered a few questions raised and then got bored and wrote ""the end."""
2,"Wierd Story, plot.","A surrealistic plot which jumps between fantasy and realism. Not the best Goddard book I've read. In fact, I didn't finish it."
3,Light entertainment,"Ian Jarret, a photographer, was taking pictures in Vienna when he came across the figure of a woman dressed in boots, overcoat, gloves, scarf and fur-trimmed hat. That's how Ian's affair with Marion Esguard started although both were married at the time. Marion suggests that they make a clean break and a fresh start once they return to England. She lets Ian photograph her naked on their bed after passionate sex.Back in England, Ian declares to his wife Faith that he doesn't wish to live with her anymore and leaves her as he is about to meet Marion again. But then he discovers that the films he brought back from Vienna are blank and exposed as though in a deliberate and calculated act of destruction. In a subsequent phone call Marion admits having sabotaged the films and declares not being able to see Ian again for obscure reasons.And so begins a wild chase for Ian after the woman he loved so much and after the secrets that lie behind her strange existence."
4,"Very good, but a lot of annoying spelling mistakes !!!","Okay. I agree with all of the above rewiews. This is a great book. BUT... maybe i'm the only one who finds it annoying, but damn !!! They should have triple checked the spelling !!! Some of the ""shortcut-keys"" they mentions is wrong. It's like they forgot to change the default-key!!! And a few places they have a menu-link that's not in the program. Try findign ""Window/Arrange all"" in ""SymbolEditMode > Edit in new Window"". I sure can't !! Small errors that's really annoying !!!"
1,Live in Someone Else's Heart,"Hey, remember when really long album titles were cool? I thought I would identify with this disc with Brady Brock and I both being recent college graduates; I was wrong. Instead of singing about everyman troubles of stretching a paycheck to cover rent and beer, he's singing about his friends and their love problems. Gone is the self-centeredness of twenty-somethings. Brock's vocals, reminiscent of Ben Folds, sound untrained and an upright bass adds a nice low-end element to several tracks. ""Walk, Don't Walk"" is made perfectly for an indie film soundtrack. Brock is not without talent, it will just take a couple more records for him to get there."
4,"Krenz, Castle or Quick (her pseudonyms)","I read all of her books. Have not been disappointed yet. This one about the girl who asks the tycoon to marry her (temporarily) and to keep her brother's electronic co. going is another winner. The bother has died in a plane crash, but she doesn't believe he is dead."
5,One of my all-time favorite books,"Jayne Ann Krentz is probably my favorite author and this is my favorite of her books to date. All of the characters are likeable and interesting and Oliver Rain is a fascinating, sexy hero. I have all of her books but if I could only keep one, this would be it"
2,My first Kindle purchase and wasn't worth the $7.99,"If this were a movie I would suggest that you watch it at the dollar theatre on a day when you had nothing better to do because the writing is not good. It doesn't make sense, not very descriptive and not worth full price. Perhaps a dollar."
2,Replica of her Amanda Quick's Scandal,"If you've read her Amanda Quick novels, this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel, ""Scandal"".Heroine proposes to hero, who has a hidden agenda. Of course he's rich and he has almost the same history as ""Scandal"", whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w/ the debt, and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father's friends/business associates want paid right away. Of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up. But his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path.The book is so similar that a couple of times I caught myself looking at the cover to make sure I had the right book. The only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time."
2,Too much going on,"I can't put my finger on exactly what I don't particularly like about this book. It wasn't terrible, but after this second reading I wouldn't read it again. Safe to say I didn't like Oliver (and yes I can understand how he became the control freak he was) and Annie wasn't particularly bright either (no excuse I can think of for that). JAK's characters/books can be repetitious. But I do like some of her writing. I just won't buy any more at this time."
2,Not her best effort....,"This story started out promising, but it just kept going downhill. Annie was far too forgiving; I wanted to shake some sense into that girl. I thought Oliver was a jerk who didn't deserve Annie. My favorite books of Jayne Ann Krentz's are Sharp Edges and Sweet Fortune."
4,Acrylic Wine Goblets,These are nice pieces. Great for taking out on the patio where you wouldn't want broken glass.
5,Very well built,This little light is very bright and works well. I have carried one in my pocket almost every day for years. If you have one that gets broken just ship it back to ASP and they replace it free!
3,I didn't like this product very much. I ...,"I didn't like this product very much. I use floss on a regular basis. This product had a good minty flavor which I liked, but after using it for about one minute, the strands of the floss started to fray and separate. This was a major drawback. By the end of flossing, the piece of floss was in tatters. It didn't have a smooth feeling against my teeth. Also, the packaging was very big and clumsy so it takes up a lot of space in a suitcase or purse. Overall, I give it a C-."
2,Look elsewhere,"I purchased this item at a local drug store, not through Amazon.The floss gets caught between tight teeth, both molars and incisors, and consequently gets frayed and tattered. The floss also occasionally jammed in the dispenser, requiring me to pull at various angles to free it up. Poor product in a poor container. It is a functional product, it does the job, but not pleasant to use. The only consolation is that I bought only one."
5,A Phenomenal Book,I think the other reviewers have definitely given great reviews of this book by Dick Temple. There is not much more I can add than to say this is one of the most special books I have ever read. It is a must read by anyone interested in Icons and in exploring their own spiritual journey to God. This book may change your life! The book is very readible and easy to follow for the lay-person like myself who is neither a philosopher or theologian.
1,NOT RECEIVED ORDER AFTER 13 DAYS,"I ORDERED 2 FOG LIGHTS FOR MY JEEP ON THE 18TH OF JANIT IS NOW THE 30TH. NO LIGHTS. CONTACTED COMPANY, GOT THE RUN AROUND. SPOKE WITH FEDEX AND THEY SAID ""THE COMPANY ORDERED THE TRACKING NUMBER BUT THE ITEMS HAVE NOT BEEN ELECTRONICLY SCANNED BY A FEDEX REP. IN THER WORDS THE ITEMS HAVE NEVER BEEN SHIPPED. THE COMPANY IN QUESTION ACTUALLY TOLD ME,""WE RESENT YOUR ORDER"". WHEN I ASKED FOR A TRACKING NUMBER TODAY, HE REPLIED,""WE USED THE SAME TRACKING NUMBER"". I DON'T THINK SO.IF I GET MY ORDER IN A COUPLE OF DAYS I WILL APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THINGS DO HAPPEN, BUT DON'T LIE ABOUT IT AND EMAIL OR CALL WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE."
2,Confusing,I am a beginner to screenwriting and would NOT recommend this book for those who are just starting out. Kate Wright writes in convoluted sentences that do not make sense. She trades clarity for obscurity. Her examples are worst than her writing. I have read part of Syd Field's screenwriting books and found them to be more clear. Field's book is accessible while this book is pretentious and not helpful or detailed enough.Do not waste your money buy Field's book.
1,This Sucks,"This script coach claims to have gleaned all her glorious wisdom at the knee of Tennessee Williams, then proceeds to impart her knowledge through examples from two asinine movies--Titanic and Fugitive--and one entertaining yet hardly deep, Tootsie. And she does this with vague, unclear, convoluted sentences with her own coined, unnecessary jargon to say something that once understood could have been said in a few simple words. I hated it. Read McKee."
2,ax's and shields,While I found this kit to be rather nice in picture but rather auckward in play. I have been collecting castle Lego kits for 9 yrs now and from the old Forester meets Black knight routine Lego has come a long way. However price wise Lego has come A llllllllllllllong way (no offense). I oppreciate the realism of the banner covered stead. And the creativity of the chain mounted black war horse just adds to the fun that Lego always included.
2,Sad Little Story,"As an admirer and reader of most of Naipaul's work, it is sad to see the shallowness of his recent novels. Magic Seeds is a story of the inner commentary on life by characters with no insight, who lead passive, childish and sterile lives. What a waste. Perhaps, in his bitterness, Naipaul finds amusement creating these wretches or perhaps, in the end, he really has nothing to say.Give it a pass. It is empty."
5,Good,This book was in great condition when I purchased it. It was to the point and as interesting as you can make philisophy be...gave very good examples and clear understanding of what everthing means.
2,"Pretty sad but it does the job, in a tasteless, trashy way.","I would never display a real sword on this trashy thing, let alone 6 of them. However, I only bought it for my bokkens and I guess it does the job.The craftsmanship is sub-par. The little samurai guy is plastic and the factory worker who screwed mine on was either drunk to the point of being half blind or 4 years old. Re-seating the screws fixed that problem, though.The other letdown was that the package came with wing nuts to hold the horizontal parts to the sides. Easy to assemble, sure. But they pretty much removed any class this thing ever dreamed of having. I'll be making a trip to the hardware store to replace those fasteners.In conclusion, you get what you pay for. Or maybe not, because I've bought other small home furnishings for around $20 that put this junk to shame. It'll be OK with a little more work from me but seriously, don't buy this to display real weapons."
5,Eating Healthy Taste Great!,"This book is terrific for the heart healthy individual. I met Kenneth Sylvester some time ago when he began working for Mr. Mitchell. I find him to be one of the most kindest and caring individuals I know. To show how good (especially the crab salad and muffins) these recipes are, I have incorporated a variety of them into my every day diet. I have lost a total of 81 pounds in just over a year. With these recipes, eating health taste great!"
5,Low fat low sugar,This was a fabulous cookbook. Combining both low sugar and lowfat is vey important. Terrific recipes! I have tried most allof them - they even taste good and look just like the pictures.Instruction very easy to follow ...
5,Great Healthy Cookbook!,"This cookbook is excellent! Most of the recipes are very simple and easy to prepare. Finally there is a cookbook that you can use for a lifetime of healthy eating. All of the local retail outlets are temporarily out of stock. Barnes and Noble now have this book in their system, but it is not yet available in their stores. I had to borrow a copy from my neighbor. Thank you Amazon for making this great book so readily available. Again, this book has something for everyone and the recipes and illustrations look believable enough for the average person!"
4,Georgia Atlas and Gazeteer (Topo Maps!),"It seems very nicely done (but I was expecting greater detail for the roads). 60 Maps cover the entire state, at a scale of 1:182,000. Needless to say, while small roads are all shown, only major roads are labeled with route numbers. Generally useful, for bouncing around the back roads, and it would probably be very nice when coupled with a GPS. But I had hoped for more, or possibly a different scale for cities and towns. I assume the whole DeLorme series is the same (but I don't know). Price was right, and I'll keep it in the car, but I'll have to supplement with county maps."
5,Super hero squad squad!!,my son loves Super Hero squad and he is not always around to view it..during its boardcast t 7am & 3pmso the dvd first season helps
3,It's OK,"I ordered this as I was eager to own the complete first season of this show on DVD. However, I was disappointed to realize the audio of the episodes is 2.0 instead of 5.1. Also, there are no subtitles; therefore, I recommend the Shout! Factory distributed DVDs of this series."
4,"Very beefy, but not a complete substitute for real sockets","I bought the King Gator socket hoping to use it on the cover for my house's water feed at the street. This cover has a pentagonal-shaped ""nut"" and, rather than buy a dedicated (and expensive) socket for that, I figured I'd try the Gator Grip socket with its ability to conform to odd-shaped sockets. This would have worked except that the barrel of the Gator Grip was so large that it didn't fit in the recess of the cover! This is not really anything wrong with the Gator Grip, but it does highlight a potential problem if you want to use it in an area of tight clearance.I was impressed with the construction and finish of the Gator Grip socket, and the pins were very beefy. I do note that when you buy it from Amazon it comes in a plain cardboard box, not the retail card packaging as shown in the picture."
1,Junk nothing but a paper weight,i used this tool twice first time it worked great the second time however was a completely different story the socket keep sliping in the hex nut i was attempting to remove i lloked at the socket and noticed several pins where broke and wouldn't return to there position so i stuck a screw driver in the other side to attemp to force them back in place it worked tryed it again same story but this time several more pins where stuck so i just threw the piece of junk away and cut my losses i hope eventually a universal socket would come along and fix that issue because it would be nice to have one socket to do it all
1,PIECE OF CRAP TOOL,"Bought this tool to remove locking lugnuts, as described by manufactor. Did not live up to ANYTHING they desribed. Tool was broken inside of five minutes and did not even loosen the nut. Unbreakable solid steel pins, what a load of BULL! Wish I would have bought the ten dollar knock off from the gas station to learn this lesson. Do not believe the meaningless hype."
5,Johnson & Johnson Reach Extra Wide Dentotape,"Strong, high quality ribbon floss that does not shred like all other brands I have used. I culd not find this particular product on any store shelf, but I found it here. Shopped Wal~Mart, Osco, CVS, Walgreen's and Target, no go. Stocked up two to make sure that I'm all good for quite awhile."
4,Just what I was looking for,"The Reach Dentotape Extra Wide Floss, Waxed was just what I wanted. Wish flavoring would be added. I have recommended it highly except for the normal ""string"" taste."
5,A book to help you do the maximum,"There is a subtle but very important difference that separates this book from the competition. EXTREME SUCCESS is not just advice about how to become successful. This book offers powerful, specific strategies to expand current success into new areas and levels. This message really resonates with ""high achievers"", people who already may be very successful but want to find greater success, and do it with balance, focus and ease. Highly recommended."
2,nothing new here,"This book is mainly about how macho Rich Fettke is and how we should all be like him. His seven rules for success are obvious and not especially enlightening. There are better books about success. ""The E-Myth Revisited"" is a very useful book about succeeding in business, and ""Your Money or Your Life"" is a very useful book about developing a satisfying life."
2,Worth the $1.99 I paid,"According to the author, if you work hard, you are ""struggling"". And if you don't work hard, you will succeed. But you will need ""success partners"".The rest of the book, the author tells us how he got visions and revelations while skydiving, mountain climbing, mountain biking and bungee jumping. Does that mean that a person who is physicaly handicapped can never achieve extreme success?????I got this book in the bargain bin for $1.99. And there are a lot more copies... makes you wonder, doesn't it??? Before you trash this review... ask yourself... which part of what I wrote isn't true????? Leave this PoS on the shelf!!!"
5,Extremely Useful!,"Wow! I have read a number of self help books and this is one of the best.To me self help and success are about being happy and fulfilled, not just about money (although money is a definite part of the equation). This book addresses most areas of my life that I am interested in making the best they can be.It has very pragmatic ideas and excercises. It's not just concepts, it's things you can actually put into action. The examples and anecdotes make it easy to understand and fun to read.Some well developed ideas I like included 'you create your own luck', 'if you seek struggle you will find it, if you seek ease you will find it', and 'FEAR Focus Explore Assess Respond'."
5,Worth its weight in gold!,"Rich seems to take the mystery out of success that enables anyone to succeed despite current or past setbacks. I've read quite a few other success books written by the likes Tony Robbins, NLP authors, etc., and they are all great, but Rich has found a way for you or me to take those small steps that eventually become giant strides without us even realizing it at first.By making sure that our lives are on their way being balanced Rich asks ourselves some tough questions (that are hard to answer sometimes) but really get the job done. Super salespeople ask the tough questions to their customers, Rich is no different. By being truthfull to yourself we enable the changes to take place that we want...not only on one level but on all levels. Much thanks to Rich for enabling me with the tools for Extreme Success!!!"
3,itrip griffin for Nano 2nd Generation,its an ok ok productbetter that the off street products that i tried earlierwhat i really like is that it fits very well with the old ipod nanoperformance could be better as the signal varies when even kept inside the carthere is a hiss sometimes and interference
3,Works..... but not great.,"I love the way this transmitter integrates with the Nano. It fits perfectly and makes a neat and tidy package, however; the transmitter is so weak that you MUST place the unit VERY close to the receiver and/or its antenna. Even then, there is often more static/interference than I'm comfortable with. If you find just the right spot and don't move, it works fine but while driving, you should expect inconsistent sound quality. I think it's worth the price but please don't set your expectations too high."
2,Pure Disappointment,"I bought the Itrip because of the reputation Griffin has. I am simply disappointed with this product. The range is extremely short & is sometimes filled with static. I would not recommend this product to anyone, especially at a cost more than $15. Griffin definetly dropped the ball on this product. Next time I won't be purchasing a Griffin product."
1,"Slow, dirty and very flimsy","Hamsters are fast critters. So why did they make this thing run so sloooow?This is a fun toy for our chihuahua, but just for 3min. Can't see why anyone would purchase this for a human... well, maybe if your child is super allergic to animals.Anyway, the ""hamster"" itself seemed like it got out of it's box to party with rats or something... 'cause it arrived veeery dirty LOL!It feels like a 3-5$ toy."
1,"Hamusuta, the Happy Hamster Ball's Poor Design!","My Rat Terrier, LuLu, loved this toy. She enjoyed pushing it around and trying to get the Hamster. The problem with this toy is:1. You have to ""open"" the ball to turn on and to turn off the Hamster.2. The two spheres that make up the ball is difficult to connect back together.3. The spheres connect by matching and ""popping"" opposite ""bumps"" into matching holes, not easy.4. And the ""bumps"" do not fit deeply and/or tightly enough to keep the two spheres together during play.This saddens me because my dog really loved to chase this hamster in a ball around the house. But once it pops open, I don't think it is safe for her to have the small, mechanized hamster, still running, to chew on."
1,Don't buy!,"I got this for Christmas gifts and when I opened it...after throwing away packing info, the ball will not stay together. The kids wanted this for Christmas so I plan to give the hamster and not give the ball.Even though,I know they will want to know where the ball is."
1,Not for little ones with long hair.,These are very cute. They roll their little balls around. BUT BEWARE.... They will suck your little ones hair right out of their head. My grandbaby now has a bald spot right in the front of head...Gone... This hurt her also. They are dangerous. I am throwing them away or returning.
3,Good Substitute,"My children were asking for 'Zhu Zhu Pets' for Christmas, but I wasn't going to pay higher than MSRP so this made a very good substitute. They were quite happy with them; no regrets. Be careful if your child has long hair - it will get caught in the wheel if they get too close."
4,Good replacement for Zhu Zhu,"Since Zhu Zhu pets are impossible to find at reasonable prices, we tried one of these instead. We were able to take the hamster toy out of its ball, and use it with the zhu zhu accessories. It worked pretty well for the most part. Others have figured this out too, so now they are getting harder to find! Cracker Barrel was sold out!"
4,Fun toy,Our school fundraising event had this item as a gift for selling 50 items. My kids are lucky to sell 5. My daughter was devastated as she really wanted this toy. So for Christmas I bought it for her and she loves it! It really is fun running around the house and our dogs sure are entertained by it. It was well worth the $7.95 plus shipping we spent. I have a very happy 8 year old who didn't have to sell $1000 worth of junk to get it! :)
5,Hamsuta the Happy Hamster,"This is the second Hamsuta the Happy Hamster that we purchased. My daughter enjoyed her first so much that when it got malled by our dogs, we decided to purchase another. Hamsuta has been a very entertaining toy for my two-year old daughter and my husband and I as we watch her laugh and giggle with glee. My daughter loves to play with it by herself or with others. Friends have gotten a kick as well. The biggest disappointment is the ball that comes with Hamsuta. It's made of hard plastic and is not very durable. Ours has been dropped one too many times and is now cracked but...we've gotten our money's worth."
4,Daughter loves it,"I wasn't sure if I would find the zhu zhu pet so I got this and my daughter (5) loves it. She also has a zhu zhu pet and she plays with both. This one doesn't make all the sounds, but it is nice it comes with a ball. It is much less likely to end up behind a piece of furniture. It also only uses one battery! I bought some of the 'clothes' that people were selling for the zhu zhu pets and they fit great! I also got one for my Grandma's cat. I am not sure if the cat likes it too much, but my Grandma (100) loves it as well!"
3,Ok for the price,Like a zhu-zhu pet but doesn't have the quality of one. Good enough to play around with. Less costly than the Zhu-Zhu. Comes with the ball at no extra price.
3,Ball Comes Apart Too Easily,"The grandkids love this little hamster. My main complaint is that they ALWAYS open the ball and just run the hamster across the floor. I guess this isn't too bad since the kids are having fun but I guess I could just buy a hamster and forget the ball. Further, the way the two hemispheres fit together makes it impossible for a child to reassemble the ball.....so granddad must always reassemble the ball."
4,What a great alternative to Zhu Zhu,"My 8 year-old son discovered Zhu Zhu pets and asked for one long after they were readily available. We found the Happy Hamster - which comes with the ball - in the NY Hall of Science for $9 and he was thrilled to get it. Given that the 45 minutes he played with it so far may be all there is, I am happy to have avoided the Zhu Zhu hassle."
5,FUN!!!,"It's such a cute toy! I like it way better than the zhuzhu pets because the noises they make annoy me so much, so I got this cute better quiet one instead. And when it's in its ball and it hits a wall it will turn around, but when it's out of its ball and hits the wall it just stops. I wish I could have real pets, I love this hamster so much!"
4,My Yorkie Loves Hamasuta!,"This is great toy for my Yorkie. If she is too rough with it, the ball comes open and the hamster is free. My dogs waits until I put it back into the exercise ball before resuming play. It rolls on carpet fine but is better on hard floors. I use a rechargeable AAA battery and it lasts a long time. You can't go wrong with the price."
2,zhu zhu pets,I purchased two pets for my 8 and 4 year old kids. The first problem was opening one of the pets to put in the batteries. A little hard to see the right way to open since it is just a raised area on the underside and you know how hard it can be to see 'so called' directions that are imprinted on white plastic. The kids enjoyed playing with them. The one other problem was that my daughter got a good chunk of hair (she has mid-length fine hair) pulled out when it got stuck around one of the pets wheels. These wheels go around very fast and there should be some type of guard around the wheels to prevent hair from getting wrapped around them and ripped out. I guess I would say these pets are fine for older kids but keep an eye or don't get them for your younger ones.
3,Kids lost interest quick.,"It's cute and works as described. However, after watching it do it's thing a while the kids lost interest. Not quite the substitute for the ZhuZhu I expected. Or maybe the ZhuZhu is not all that great either."
4,Hamusuta in a ball,"Came right on time. Daughter (6 years old) loves it. It was a holiday gift and it's still ticken. And the price, fantastic! Suggested to others to buy as gifts."
4,Hamusuta,"This is really cute. It goes all over the carpet. Turns around when it hits a bump. My grandson asked if I was sure it wasn't real because it ""knows"" to turn around when it comes to an obstacle. Had us all laughing."
3,"Cheap as they come, but fun!","This toy is as cheap as they come, but my toddler wanted a hamster and I wasn't about to bring a real rodent in the house. I bought this for him to play with, and he had a blast holding the ball in his hands and watching the hamster roll about in circles.The ball is hard plastic, and pretty clear so you can see the hamster fairly well. Though it's not very durable, and after a few drops (which with kids you expect) the latches did not close completely. The hamster works in and out of the ball, and could ""scurry"" over our hardwood floors with ease. Up close the hamster looks very fake, but in the ball and to a toddler - real enough to save me from sawdust and rodent droppings. A winner in my book."
3,Works as advertised (for a while). Bad cat toy.,"I bought this to roll around the floor and entertain my cat. She is just not interested in anything that won't move on its own, so I tried this. The toy does roll around the floor, and quite well. If it hits something, it just turns around and goes the other way. The problems are that it makes too much noise - cat just stares and runs away - and the battery dies after about 30 minutes of use. I bought the heavy duty energizer batteries, and the thing just piddles out after 1 or 2 uses. Not very economical (or environmentally friendly). This might be fun for a very small child, but no good for a cat."
3,Okay for the price,This little toy is great for the price. I was trying to get something that my son would be entertained by for a long time. It is a very adorable toy good for children at least for five years old. It would also make a great pet toy for your cat or dog chased around the house or yard
1,Junk,"Junk, not worth your time and trouble to get lasted maybe and minute, hamster does not even make ball move."
5,BEST PET TOY,"My cats love this toy. Recommend it highly. Instructions a little off. Battery under mouse body, not on bottom. Pull body off the motor part. Easy to set up and run. Rarely stops, because of obstructions. Great design."
4,Great toy for six year olds,I bought the track for this toy at a Christmas craft show only to give it to my grandson to find out the hamster didn't come with it. They should have made point to tell me that when I bought it. I ended up having to buy the hamster online. It was a very cute toy that was fun for the kids so I am glad I purchased it but would have preferred to have them sold together!
3,Hamusuta the Happy Hamster,"Sometimes, you don't know whether to laugh or cry. That is kinda how I feel about Hamusuta. He's a hamster, and a happy one at that. He isn't very durable, but he does work. I guess this would be great for someone in the 5-9 year old range, possibly an alternative to getting your son/daughter an actual hamster. Much less upkeep. There really isn't anything wrong with the product, but I just don't really see how viable this thing really is. Maybe I'm just missing the point."
1,You get what you pay for,"Cute idea, but it broke almost immediately and never worked again. It just isn't very well made. Would not recommend it."
3,Hard to close,"I bought this for a 2 year old because he loves to play with my pet mice. The only bad thing about this toy is that it is very difficult to close! you open it to turn the hamster on, but when closing it is hard to line it up exactly and get it to stay shut. I ended up giving him a real hamster ball to put the fake hamster in, and it works so much better."
3,Almost as good as zhu zhu pets,"This hamster worked fine, rolled the ball around and when it hit an obstacle, reversed direction & kept going all over the room like a roomba, lol!! It doesn't make sounds like a zhu zhu pet, but it doesn't need a stabilizer either to work the ball properly. The price was great, too! It seems to use up batteries fairly fast, so I use rechargable AAAs."
3,"amusing toy, you get what you pay for","For the price its okay. The ball opens up easily, I have to place tape on the sides."
5,Awesome book,"This is a really great book. I'm a huge rodeo fan, and I just couldn't put this one down. It gives a great look at some of bull riding's top men, a peak into their everyday lives, careers, and thoughts. I highly recommend this book to everyone who loves a good book."
5,You're on the bull & traveling with riders in this book.,"Best nonfiction book about professional bull riders you'll find. Coplon weaves through a bull riders world both in and out of the arena. Be ready to shake the dust off your back when you finish this book--you'll feel like you've been on the back of Bodacious. Coplon makes you feel like you're partners with the top bull riders--Tuff Hedeman, Ty Murray, Cody Lambert, Jim Sharp, and legend Lane Frost. Read how the Professional Bull Riders Assoc. began and will continue to grow for decades. Best rodeo book I've ever read-again and again and again."
3,Warning,"Before you purchase this for your car make sure you find out how much it will cost to program it at the dealer. Saturn in NYC costs like $110 per hour for labor. Also, if your Saturn has problems with the body control module and you end up replacing it, then the remote will stop working because it's prgramed for the previous BCM. Just a heads up!"
3,"Cul De Sac-'Crashes To Light,Minutes To It's..'(Thirsty Ear)","Not as good as this title's follow-up release 'Immortality Lessons'(see my review),but still decent enough.Thought that 'Crashes To...' was also tough to describe,but here goes... experimental post-rock.Ten cuts with a total of 72:54,so it is a long record.Best two tracks that held my full attention were the nearly ten-minute ""A Voice Through A Cloud"" and the disc's other lengthy tune ""Sands Of Two Jima"".Line-up:Glenn Jones-guitar,Michael Bloom-bass,Robin Amos-synth and John Proudman-drums.Just might appeal to fans of Jessamine,Tortoise,Flying Saucer Attack and Jim O'Rourke."
3,Too monotonous of an album,"I think the music is actually good, but the problem is that there is little variation from song to song. If you hear 1 song, you've heard the whole album essentially. It might be good background music, but there really is nothing memorable about the album that would make me want to put it on for my friends are drive to on a sunny day. Of course I realize this is post-rock and you aren't as likely to find catchy hooks or melodies, but 73 minutes of hearing the exact same style of music with little variation makes it not worth it to me. I'll likely be exchanging the album for something else at the store. May I suggest Stereolab's Dots and Loops. Stereolab proves that you can be post-rock and still have melodious and memorable music."
1,date movie,"I was unable to view the movie.It looks like I got defective DVD.Thanks a lot ""Amazon"".Mike"
2,Confusing description,"This item came up when I searched Amazon for Wine Sticks. From the web description it was not clear that these were for glasses or cans and not wine glasses. I had to return them and re-order the wine glass stakes, which cost about $20 in shipping to order & return and re-order. After all that not exactly a bargin."
1,Hose burst after 1 week,"Bought this hose from a retailer. Seemed like a great concept, but in practice it was harder to reel in than I had hoped; and after a few days the thing burst -- big 2-inch hole in the side. Don't waste your money."
1,melnor magna hose,This hose is not very durable I only used it a few times and it busted and I can't find any place to get a connector to fix it.
1,Junk,"I brought this hose after a girlfriend suggested it, if you only need a small amount of hose I suppose it might work fine. I brought the 75 foot length,and ultimately need to unwind the hose completely. Poor water pressure and trying to wind this hose back up is a workout, what a joke, wish I had read these reviews before I wasted my money."
1,Awful product,"While the idea of the Magnahose sems quite good, in reality the product is just about useless. Poor craftmanship is the first indication of the overall terrible quality of this hose...it is of a flimsy and cheap construction. The design of the hose also gives you next to no pressure at the nozzle. My magnahose can only send a jet of water about eight feet while another hose on the same tap can shho well over twenty. Don't waste your time or money on this terrible product. Melnor should be ashamed."
1,Should be called the LEAKY HOSE,It sprung a leak immediately at the end of hose. I repaired it. Next time it sprung a leak in the middle. A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
2,"A great idea, but . . .","If you have ""light duty"" watering tasks, then the Magna Hose is a great find. (Particularly for the elderly or those stricken with arthritis.) However, I did notice a significant loss of water pressure when using the 75' version as compared to my old fashion heavy duty hose. Also, the stand doesn't ""stand"" when placed on any slightly uneven surface (such as the lawn). Personally, I need the length to be 100', but hooking up an ""add-on"" piece would defeat the mobility bonus and likely decrease the water-pressure even further. I may keep it around and trade-off between my heavy duty hose, as the benefits of the Magna Hose seem to slightly outweigh the negatives, but unfortunately I'll still need the alternate solution."
3,It was great until it sprung a leak,"I got this hose not really sure if it would be as wonderful as it said. I was really impressed with how light weight it was, even while using it, and with how easy it was to unwind and wind back up. And, just like it says, you don't have to unwind the whole thing to be able to use it. It also had pretty good pressure which I was concerned about because I had gotten low pressure on one of those coil hoses (the kind that look like a green slinky). However, the very first time I used it - it sprung a leak and started spraying all over the place. I'm hoping I just happened to get a defective one and am thinking about trying a new one. The only other drawback is that I really need a longer hose, and it doesn't say anything about hooking two together. I guess you could do that but you would have to unhook them each time you reeled it back up. I would have given this a 5 if it hadn't busted the very first time I used it."
1,Piece of JUNK !!!,"Don't waste your money, not one good thing to say about this product. There should be a law against companys taking advantage of consumers with crap like this. I would to meet these guys in person, they are crooks."
1,Not a piece of junk - WORSE!,"Why can't you give it ZERO stars? It certainly isn't worth even one. This is an absolutely useless product that never performs as advertised, is cheaply made, and impossible to use. The reel spreads, the hose comes out of the feeder slot, the hose kinks, and it would take Superman to wind it up. Any store (or e-retailer) selling this product should be ashamed of themselves."
1,I need -1 star for this rating.,It's a crime that someone wasted any amount of natural resources and industrial energy in creating this product. It's more effective to use a bucket and run back and forth between point a and point b than hooking up this disgrace. The thing leaks like George Bush's CIA intelligence office.I can't believe they sell this at Home Depot (where I bought it). Someone needs to picket outside retailers that sells this pile of elephant man**re.
5,excellent recompilation,Piazzolla's music will remain as well known as classical composers are remembered. Music to watch or just to relax and enjoy with eyes closed.
1,Cabinet Grease Remover,Who say it is great?! I don't like it because I have to use up the bottle to finish by two cabinets. It is terrible.
4,Good alarm/steering wheel lock,"I find this item to be strong, and judging from a similar steering wheel lock I had before this one, effective. (Someone broke into my truck, had time to open the glove box before the alarm went off but NOTHING WAS TOUCHED INSIDE!) The alarm is vey loud, scary as hell, (voice of experience, as I accidently got in the truck without disarming this one... IT GIVES NO WARNING! The moment I sat in the driver's seat it went off, right in my face!) That is the only improvement I would suggest... maybe ten seconds or so of short beeps or chirps, to give you time to disarm it if you forget to before you get in the vehicle."
5,good product,like the high visability and built in loud alarm .Seems very sturdy and asnap to set up ie quicker than other steering or brake locks
1,Doesn't take a gorilla to yank it off the steering wheel,"They found my car with the Gorilla Grip Steering Wheel Lock still locked, but it was on the floor where the car thief put it after yanking it off the wheel with its' convenient long handle that supplies plenty of leverage. The steering wheel only suffered some gouges in it in the process.I wont be using it anymore."
2,It is the least comfortable floss...,"It is the least comfortable floss I have ever used.If you do not have strong nerve or are afraid of damage your crown, better not touch this one."
3,Oral B40 Glide dental floss,I had hoped to purchase the 100 meter container of floss. Unfortunately it appears that the only length it comes in was 50 m. This was disappointing and I wondered if the 100 m product was available.
5,I would recommend Glide Dental floss. I usually ...,"I would recommend Glide Dental floss. I usually use Dentotape, which is a lot thicker than this, but I was able to use the Glide without having to force it so much to get into the tight areas, and therefore it didn't cut my gums. I also like the fact that the container closes, keeping it clean. I will definitely purchase this again."
5,The Glide Dental Floss is unique in its ...,"The Glide Dental Floss is unique in its design in that it's a flat, instead of round, floss. The advantage of this design is that it fits easily between even the tightest-spaced teeth. It's also much stronger than some other flosses that I've used. No breakage yet, and I floss pretty hard. I'm happy with the product and will continue to purchase it in the future."
4,This floss exceeded my expectations. Like the company ...,"This floss exceeded my expectations. Like the company name suggests, it does glide easily between teeth, without shredding. The light coating of wax made the floss easy to grip. One thing negative is the price, but I would still highly recommend this product to everyone."
5,Hiei Key Chain,"I searched the internet for weeks on end trying to find this keychain. And when I found it, I about jumped for joy. Well, actually, I did jump for joy.I was amazed at how smoothly the transaction went with the Hobby Hunters store, which I ordered the key chain from, and that it came fairly quickly after I ordered it. I am very satisfied with the quality of the product, it is just how it was described. And I think Hobby Hunters for sending me the product in such a quick manner. =]"
2,Probably was OK,"I bought this item for a weed eater I had several years ago, but it wasn't the correct part for my machine. I don't remember what I did with it."
3,So so Effective Lighting,Compact and easy to install. Internal ballast module can get flaky with time. Light will not come on for a little while after flipping switch on. Not real strong illumination even for a 12 volt light. Other then that it's a very attractive light with it's simulated wood grain appearance
4,thin-lite,"The lite was just what I wanted, and it was 30.00 dollars cheaper than one in a RV store.I would tell friends about this lite."
3,hot,"Very nice light. It is bright enough for my needs. But, it gets very Hot. The metal around it is gets almost to hot to touch. It must be using a lot of my battery. We camp a lot without hook ups."
5,Pleasantly Surprised.,I was very surprised to see 99% of the red slime gone after two doses! I think I could have made it with one dose if I hadn't left the lights on too long. You must use the product and turn down your lights!
2,Didn't work out for my reef tank,"I've never used the Ultra Red Slime remover before; I usually use the Phosphate Filter Pads for Red Algae with Powder. I carefully watched the PH levels as the product had advised, despite decent levels, I lost two turbo snails and emerald grab during the medication period, both of which I've had for several years. Others reviews I read gave warning, but I chose to take the risk, and now I'm passing the warning to others, I would be very cautious when using this product."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,If you look at my reviews you will see that I have given pretty high marks to a lot of products. I generally do a lot of research before I buy and I have been very fortunate with a few exceptions. This product is one of the exceptions. Save yourself a step and buy the Loupe from Hoodman.This product actually flew apart after about three months of use. I attempted to raise the cover and suddenly there was the cover and the spring that made it work flying through the air. Enough said.
2,Junk,"I broke this thing using it for the first time. The tiny plastic hinge tab snapped off on one of the side leafs after I flipped the hood open and closed for maybe the 12th time. I suppose if you planned on leaving the hood open always, this thing might function fine for what it was intended for, but if you expect to have it to survive opening and closing more than a few dozen times, guess again.Oh, and for the record, I've been a professional photographer for over 20 years and I don't break equipment - ever.This thing IS junk."
5,A fun textbook,"This is an outstanding textbook. It is well structured, clear and enjoyable. It uses a very active approach to learing the language and doesn't bog you down in grammar. This will have you reading arabic in no time! I keep refering back to it even in my university arabic course. The book/tape pack is excellent - you really need the pronunciation help with arabic."
3,not the best,"i found this book decidedly mediocre, and ended up returning it. it did not seem to be written with very much thought to it -- the organization was not that good, the exercises not so helpful, and the editing poor. i would recommend ""teach yourself arabic"" instead.in general i have not been satisfied with any of the language books or dictionaries published by hippocrene. avoid them if possible."
3,Mastering Arabic,"This is a good introduction to Arabic. Regretfully, the book is useless without the audiotapes. The tapes are inexpensive, and available online through Hippocrene Books' website. Without alot of drills and exercises in each chapter, it is necessary to repeat the same audio exercises over and over again to absorb pronunciation, and, as a result, very little vocabulary is learned. This is still a good foundation course for further study."
3,The accompanying tapes for this text are NOT available,"I ordered this book based on the recommenations posted. Indeed, the book is excellent. The text is rendered, however, totally useless for beginners because its accompanying tapes are unavailable. They cannot even be ordered at this point. I fully expected the textbook to arrive with the tapes. Learning without them, for a beginner, means practicing in poor pronunciation and future oral comprehension problems."
1,Not a child friendly version of this story,I gave this book one star because I didn't like the version of this story. I also did not like the illustrations. I was looking for a version that a young child would enjoy. This was too busy- not simple enough to grab a young child's interest. The company that provided the book gave excellent service.
3,Emergency book,I bought this on the fly to let my son practice reading when out and about. It was also very handy to show the preschoolers I teach.
4,Another fine release....,"...from Alejandro Escovedo. This time out he continues down his ""baroque"" singer-songwriter-meets- the-Rolling Stones path he's been cultivating most of this decade. Although this is no substitute for his live shows (do see him if you can!), it's a decent album showcasing his songwriting ability, as well as his excellent selection of cover tunes. Oh, yeah....long live Buick McKane!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great album of Covers,"Alejandro is great, this is a very nice travelling album. I would recommend this absolutely. Pale Blue Eyes and Irene Wilde are stunning."
4,Great book,If you want to learn the basics of timber framing this book is great. It goes through the process of building one type of timber frame house with good detail as well as an understanding of why they did things the way they did in the past.
4,Lee Reloading Die Set,"I recently bought a 45-70 Shiloh Sharps for competition and needed a set of loading dies, a friend told me to try Lee and they seem to be working out very well."
2,Ledbetter Olympics,this was not my favorite Jerry Clower product. He has made many good ones but this lacked the good story lines I have been accustomed to see in his other presentations.Charlie Thompson
5,Excellent Prog-Metal,"...Vanden Plas is an incredible band. They have partially moved away from their DT-wannabe-ness (now that's certainly a word) from their last album. This is a very solid album. The highlights for me would have to be Cold Wind, Scarlet Flower Fields and their cover of Point of Know Return. If you liked Vanden Plas before, pick this up. If not, this or Far off Grace is a good start."
5,A Spiritual Experience,"For anyone who loves nature and classical music, this is a must-see. With a narrative that emphasizes the spiritual ""essence"" of this wondrous park paired with gorgeous classical music, this video transports you into a calm and spiritual place. As a Wyoming native who has seen this park many times, I never ever get over the beauty and absolute wonders that make up this ecosystem. A good balance of narrative and ""quiet"" with music and scenes make this a great viewing experience. I highly recommend this to any nature lover!"
4,Good Jolson CD With A Different Selection,"As a great Al Jolson fan, there are few Jolson CD's I do not like. This is a good one, with selections not found in most Jolson CD's, including, ""Are You Lonely Tonight"" and the 40's version of ""I'm Sitting On Top of the World.""There are many Jolson CD's available, and this is a good one if you have a few of the others. But some other CD's (like Al Jolson, The Best of the Decca Years) are probably better for the new Jolson fan. The mixing on this one is okay, but several others seem to provide more depth of sound.Jolson is, in my view, the greatest entertainer and my favorite male soloist of all time. Although some CD's might be a bit better, you would certainly not be making a mistake getting this one."
4,Does anyone know?,"When i bought the CD i thought it was very good. The only problem i am having is, that latino salsa type of song that they play when Eddie and Robert go to the Club to see Cesar Vargas. Its Not on the CD and i like that song! I was woundering if anyone knows who sings it? Or where i might be able to find it? ThanksOther then that Its a great CD!"
1,Latino song on Showtime,"Hi.This song his ""Jumpi"" from ""Un poquito quema'o"" by ""Sergent Garcia"".It's a french artist. In France it's very easy to buy this CD, but in other country i don't no!I find it on amazon but it's not the same tracks that my cd!This artist is close of ""Manu chao"""
4,My family found Reach Dental Floss easier to ...,"My family found Reach Dental Floss easier to use than the store brand we'd been using. It was easier to dispense. It also frayed less during flossing, so we used less than normal. We've already purchased more Reach Floss for other bathrooms in our home. Definitely recommend it over other flosses we've tried!"
5,great little multi purpose clamp,"After hearing and reading about these clamps I began to look around for a pair to try out. When I first picked one up I grew skeptical because of their lightweight. It turns out this first impression was unfounded. These clamps really speed up basic clamping time. For clamping down a straight edge or holding two cabinets together during installation, you just can't beat these clamps. You can't draw together difficult joints, mind you, but they excel at one handed clamping tasks while your other hand is holding your afternoons work together. Their light weight and relatively small size make them easily stowable in shop apron or tool belt. The speed is not only in the clamp up action but in the ease of release, as well. A single finger and thumb will easily release the lever. I am sold on them."
5,Beutiful,Dont miss this one!Its one of the best played piano and string quartet from Dvorak out there.About this string quartet... well those of you familliar with Deccas Bartok 6 string quartets understand the extremly high quality of these guys and if you dont... trust me on this or read all reviwes about Bartoks 6 string quartets on Decca with Takacs string quartet.Haefliger is marvelous on piano here and do justice to Dvoraks lovely pieces.Its a very moving set and well worth its price.
4,Excellent but missing something,I love my flash drive. i have the 4gb version and use the migo and secure traveller a lot. i am currently a senior developer at a software engineering company and i am constantly using it to deploy solutions i have authoured onto our servers. its nice and small (actually all flash drives are) so its easily gets lost and i am the type of person that will rather have no flash drive than one with a missing lid. So kingston please put a chain on the lid that attaches to the main part. also it would be nice if it was waterproof like my last one (Cayon 1gb - i lost the lid).
5,The best books of the world!,"Hi!I'm from German and I'm twelve,my English isn't very good,but I hope you can read my sentences!Here in German is only book eight the end,now!But book nine and ten must coming!I love these books,and I can't stop read,when I've got the ones side read!I think,these books are so real!Amy is a girl,she understand the horses and the peopels!I don't think what going on in book nine and ten,but I'm happy when they give here in German,because,I love Lauren Brooke,and Heartland!"
3,Slow Moving Series and Book by Lauren Horseback Rider,This book and series is slow moving.Okay and sad book.The horse dies!
2,No difference seen in my hair falling out,"I have been using this product for 6 months now. I have not found there to be any noticable difference in my hair thinning problem. My hair still falls out as much as before. Also, I find the odor to be too strong smelling (like chemicals -- not pleasant at all). I have cut back to just using it once a week instead of using it all the time."
2,Mix Masters? more like Recording Masters,"This book was not helpful at all. It claimed to include all of these tips from the masters on how to MIX, but at least 80% of the book focused on each famous producers start as an engineer and their favorite gear. Very little detail was given about general mixing techniques and if it was, it was very vague. I would recommend the MIxing engineer's handbook instead."
1,Platinum Engineers Reveal their secrets?,"I am very disappointed with the book.The book on the cover claimed: ""Mix Masters Platinum Engineers Reveal Their Secrets for Success"" but all we got was biographies and list of equipment they use with 1176 popping up almost on every other page.The question ""How much can you normally get done in a day"" just was the nail to the coffin.I read the book and I have not learned anything from it. If you are really bored on Winter night when there is a blizzard outside you can read it but I rather suggest you go to your studio and work on your music.The book is also pretty outdated, lots of stories about mixing on analog or digital tape.Solidly revised and updated new addition is needed from the author.Henry"
5,Just what I wanted,"This book was excellent and just what I wanted! Being able to ""Pick their brains"" of top recording engineers is great and the questions asked and answered were very helpful!"
4,Mix Masters,"Excellent read. Behind the glass is a bit better and covers more engineers, but very well done and helpful."
4,Great looking truck,"I'm 30 yrs old and I bought the toughtest mighty blaze and mighty blaze for my 4 & 5 yrs old nephews. These look so good, I almost wanna keep them myself. The toughtest might blaze is significantly bigger, I only wish I had a truck like this. Haven't given it to the kids yet, but i'm sure they'll love'em, I sure do. Highly recommened, I personally preferred the biggest truck which is toughtest might blaze. Price was great with the promotional coupon."
5,The way it REALLY was! Johnny Otis at his BEST!,"El Monte Legion Stadium~""Be THERE or be SQUARE!"" Thats right, thats where the saying came from. The Penguins, The Shields.....ooooh, dooobie dooo!A MUST OWN if you like the REAL oldies!"
5,Awesome music,Arrived in orig. packaging quickly. Great CD. Nice to have for road trips and just for fun listening. Great to clean to.
5,love this stuff,hey you cant buy this stuff over here in oz got to import it and love it. these guys rock i think everyone can relate to these songs in some way this is one great cd amen BILL AUSTRALIA
5,This Cd keeps going and going and never lets you down !!!!,"Wow ! talk about energy ! this cd keeps on going and going like the energizer bunny!! Be prepared to dance, even if you don't dance !!!"
4,As seen on EWTN Catholic TV,Has the Latin used in mass on TV. Great to follow mass and learn the latin by heart.
4,Great fun! Try it before bathtime or before a car ride,"We have lots of fun with this book in my house. My kids like the fun instructions and I like that it's a long activity rhyme that helps dissipate some of their (usually boundless) energy. Great for rainy days, too, when a run through the park isn't an option. Author offers fun instructions like ""Clap your hands, Stomp your feet, turn around, and take a seat"" Goes on for quite some time, with pictures of animals and kids following the directions in case you're not exactly sure what she means. Long enough to tire me out! Highly recommended for energetic kids!"
5,Awesome Book for Little Ones,"I received this book free from my local library. What a wonderful book! My daughter, who is only 1, will always grab this book first to read. We love to act out the pages of ryhmes together while I'm reading it to her. She laughs and giggles and is now starting to point things out to me! You will not be disappointed in this book if you purchase it."
3,"Lots of good information, but not current","A good book for those who need reassurance/convincing that it's okay for their child to be gay. I think it was written in 1999, so many of the references are outdated."
3,Great book for those coming out,"I found that the book answered a lot of questions for me. Just coming to terms with my homosexuality, I found the book supportive, informative and educational. Eric Marcus has a great sense of humor and his writing shows it. Recommend it strongly."
4,Educational and heartfelt.,"When my state of residence decided to prevent gays and lesbians from being foster parents, I thought enough of this book to mail it to the Child Review Board (or whatever their title was) of my state, confident that, upon reading Mr. Marcus's work, they would see the error of their ways. Alas, that proved to be naive, but it doesn't change my high opinion of this book. Although I was already gay-friendly, this book helped me to better understand gays and lesbians and provided quite a bit of interesting information. Highly recommended."
3,"Good, but not that great.","Overall, this was a helpful book but it wasn't really what I expected. If you've got a lot of questions about whether or not you might be gay or lesbian, this is not the book for you. This is more for the open open gay and lesbian people of the world..it deals a lot with situations in the work place, coming out to family etc. There is some discussion about discovering who you are, but it's not the greatest refernece for someone looking to identify and find their sexuality. It was a very interesting book, but it was just not what I was looking for. It is a great reference for those who are out and looking for answers about where/how to meet people, how to deal with co-workers, etc., but it is not at all helpful in discovering who you are."
4,Mandrell helps Greenwoods carrer.,"I never thought Mandrell and Greenwood had good chemistry as a duet partners. I admit I'm not a fan of Greenwoods music or style of singing. ""To me"" was a great song and would have been a great song with just Barbara. (Later she did re-record the song and it was so much better) One other song on the album worth a ear is ""Soft shoulder"" a fun love song. This is one of those albums only a true Mandrell or Greenwood fan would want."
4,I love this book,Nice book to have for school to learn a lot about kids and what they went through or go through.
5,Courage To Heal Workbook,I work on a behavioral health unit at a general hospital and we use this workbook frequently with our patients. The current one we have is missing 159 pages. I now keep this new one in my locker on the unit. If needed we xerox the pages we want the pts to read so that we will have a complete volume. This is a very therapeutic workbook.
3,Okay.,"I can use some of the pages in this in my practice, but it's not all great. I would recommend it for someone who is motivated to work."
5,3 excellent books,"I have read Courage To Heal, The Courage To Heal Workbook (Laura Davis)and Nightmares Echo (Katlyn Stewart). I can tell you that because of these books I am now on the path to healing. I understand so much as to why I have done some of the things I did in my past. I learned I am not alone in the feelings I had. I thank the authors of these books that have made it possible to heal."
5,Like The Black Book to AA,"These ladies get to the facts in a gentle, move ""foward"" manner. Most in AA speak of the ""Black Book"" or Bible of AA. Well, this is the Black Book for CSA Survivors. Best of all, they do NOT exclude lesbian survivors with all the myths surrounding those issues. Nor, do the exclude male survivors.Tuff issues, tuff topics, tuff healing... Hence the word ""survivor not victim"". Excellent book for a gift or to get someone on the road to recovery."
1,This book was no help to me.,"I do not recomend you but this book if you are trying to recover. It has a lot of good ststistics if that is what you are looking for. The book ""A Safe Place by"" Jan Morrison helped me more than anything, it was written for teenage girls, I am 22 and everything in it applied to me. Maybe the reason I didn't like ""The Courage to Heal"" is because of my age, I felt like this book was talking at me rather than to me. Who ever you are I wish you the best of luck in your healing."
1,Unsympathetic characters who never learn,"Characters all seem cut from the same clueless cloth (except for the title character in ""Hernando Alonso""). They are unable to understand the people around them, and sex seems to be their only metaphor. By contrast, Karen Joy Fowler's stories in ""Black Glass"" show great variety in character, style, tone, and structure."
5,Good Product,Good quality recording of original materials. Purchased for my father-in-law to replace cassettes he had for years.
5,Top Notch,"I found KliKlamps to be very powerful for their size, and they are quite adaptable for varying shapes and spacing. It took me a little bit of fiddling to catch on to the best way to set the jaws initially so that the ratchet had enough travel to tighten, but after that it's a real pleasure to use. They have a prominent place in my stash of clamping devices now."
5,Excellent product,"When you need a handy quick way to add a little or a lot of pressure to hold your project together during clue up or assembly, this is the product you need. I have several sizes of Bessey quick rachet clamps and use them on every project. I use my other clamps as a last restort. These are a MUST have for every workshop."
5,Great Book,I read this when I was a kid and thought my daughter might like it. She's 9 and struggles to find books she likes. I ordered a variety of different books on Amazon to see if we could find her something she was interested in and this series was the winner! She is begging me to order book number two. I wish these were still in print!
2,"Best Friends,but not the best book","The first in the SVT series,we are introduced to Jess and Liz at 12 years of age,when Jessica first meets the Unicorn Club,and Elizabeth first does something particular with her writing."
4,music worth listening to,"Closet Culture's album has got great lyrics and awesome melodies to equal good, quality songs. I loved how the songs were deep and could be related to. Also, the album cover was like it's own world...very artistic and it even had the lyrics written down!"
5,Coleman Cable 6-Outlet Surge Protector,The Coleman Cable 6-Outlet Surge Protector with Right Angle Plug was very affodable and works fine. This product arrived on time.
4,Hypnotic and mysterious,"I had heard about this recording from flamenco aficionados, but was skeptical that a compilation would be true to the form. In fact, it is as if a complete evening of flamenco performances had been recorded live, such is the energy and spontaneity of the singing and playing. Listen to this late at night with the lights dim and a glass of brandy. You won't be sorry."
5,Gypsy music theory done right,"This is a wonderful compilation of some of the best gypsy flamenco song I know. The Manitas de Plata songs blew me away. In English, it means ""little silver hands."" Silver is high in value, and so is the quality of the music. All odf the artist play the guitar super fast it's mind boggling. The music theory is good too. Flamenco is in the Phrygian mode which you'll find some examples of if you look it up online, but the best way to get a feel for this CD is to listen to the samples. On the review that got one star, the person complained about the screeching voices. I could see how the voices would be unpleasant, but the timbre was appropriate for the gypsy style."
1,Beware...we ship what we want,"This is the 2nd time I have been requested to write a review. Apparently my first one was never read. Basically I am very disatisfied with my purchase because what was advertised and what was shipped were not the same model number. I decided to make the purchase because they were selling the particular model I was looking for and was having no luck finding it anywhere else. Sure, I paid a little more, but it was what I wanted. After paying inflated shipping costs and waiting several days, I could have gone to a local retailer and picked it up for less and with no wait to get the model they had sent me."
4,An almost perfect guide to China,"I have lived in China for most of the past year and travelled extensively in China for the past five years. Often on my travels, Brown's book is a trusted companion when visiting one of his 50 sites. His insightful and personal accounts of his experiences are both entertaining and educational. What I like most about this book is that Brown likes China and appreciates its differences. This is not true of all guide books, especially Lonely Planet's China who delights in complaining about just about everything. Unfortunately, for guide book writers, China is changing so fast, much of Brown's information on hotels and restaurants is out of date. Restaurants and hotels sometimes disappear and new ones take their place. With that one exception, I found his information to be accurate and useful. Whether you are an old hand in China or making your first trip, this book is a must buy."
4,"Wonderful buy, great value","This purchase replaced my Spanish student daughter's lost copy. We looked at many others, but she had to have this one, She says it's the best. She used this dictionary since first year Spanish, and continues with her college language class."
5,A Simple Toothbrush!!!!,"In a world where buying a toothbrush is like buying a car, I offer this Medium Full Head Tooth Brush by Colgate as a prime example of a good sensible toothbrush. It's kind of like the Geo Prizim of Toothbrushes. Give it a try it will brush your teeth."
5,I have worn nothing else for 3 years,"Has all the advantages of a thong with none of the disadvantages. Very sexy, NO PANTY LINE EVER and doesn't stick in the back the way a thong does. Never wore anything more flattering! Full cotton crotch keeps things comfy even in the heat."
4,Nice Lace Panties,"I do really like the Tanga Panties. I feel like the sizes run about right, I wear about a size 4 and ordered a Medium and they fit great. But I am also about 5'2 and feel that the waist is rather high with longer crotch, so maybe these are better for those who are a bit taller. Other than that, nice quality and and pretty lace."
4,For those who love old time fiddle and banjo,"This was one of those records I bought on an impulse, not knowing anything about this guy. I still don't, except that this record is full of pure, traditional sounding music played by a musical wizard. It's not bluegrass, but rather the old mountain traditions that provided the foundation for Bill Monroe's invention. It's fiddle & banjo tunes mixed with mournful ballads, sung almost acapella by guest singers on the record. Two highlights of the latter category are ""The Keys To The Kingdom"" and ""The Cradle, The Coffin, The Cross On The Hill"". It's a great record. If you can appreciate some instrumental tracks as well, it's well worth checkin' out."
2,messy floss,"This floss is the first messy floss I have ever used. I go to floss, as usual, and then look down. I will have white flakes all over me and my counter. What is that? The upside it that it hasn't broken on me like the ""NEW"" Oral B Glide (old Crest Glide) brand. Crest Glide never broke on me, but they changed it when they relabeled it to Oral B. Now that stuff breaks, getting stuck between my teeth. Some day I will need to go to the dentist just to get the floss out. That is why I tried this brand. But with this mess, I am not sure if want to use this now. I may just go back to my very old standard --- the old-fashioned, gum-destroying Reach regular."
5,I found Reach EASY Slide dental floss to ...,"I found Reach EASY Slide dental floss to be just that, EASY. The floss did not shred or snag. It easily slid through places where I normally have to use a threader. My mother, after hearing about Reach Easy Slide dental floss, begged for and took the remainder of the package ... good old Mom!"
1,cuts too easily,I was trying this as an alternative to the Kroger high tech floss that I've been very happy with because my hygienist told me some of her other patients couldn't find it lately. I haven't had a chance to go looking for myself. This floss broke/cut with the first tooth and after the third time it broke I just gave up on it. Needless to say I have some very tight teeth. Maybe it will work for you if you don't have a bunch of tight crowned teeth. At least it was fairly cheap. Now to be fair I've tried other flosses that my teeth cut but they didn't claim to be specifically for tight teeth.
2,Chemical Thermodynamics,"In the McGraw-Hill Series in Advanced Chemistry, an introduction to the basic principles are presented. The presentation is organized in a systematic order which allows each principle to be built upon. The problems at the end of each chapter are pleasantly challenging and require critical thinking of the principles investigated. However, the text is overwhelmed with errors in its equations and logic. This becomes an annoyance as one tries to learn the material presented. Due to this fact, the book is hardly worth the price. Many other books can clearly present the same material."
1,I did not like it,"It appears very good. However, when you start using it, you will see some problems..."
4,easy and clean,Only the pad is dipped in solution and can be easily rinsed in between. It's lightweight and is textured for gentle scrubbing.
4,Good item,"This mop is excellent on my tiled floors. The micro fiber pads actually give a mild scrubbing effect and my floors dry rapidly. The downside to using this type of mop is that dirt appears to be pushed into my wide grout lines, making it necessary for me to clean the grout more than usual. I will have my grout sealed to see if that helps."
5,Love my siwvel mop,"I have been using the swivel mop for about 10 months now. I absolutely love it. Just dampen it, put it on, go to town and then rinse it out, continue using it and then when you are finished just peel off and throw in the washing machine. It has made my life so much easier on cleaning my hard wood floors and not streaking them. I love this. I am ordering one for my Mom."
2,Argghhhh!,"Why is it so difficult to find a simple, effective, durable mop? I bought the Swivel mop, with extra replacement pads. It looked good: light, pads easily replaced, not much to go wrong. The first time I used it, I realized my mistake. THe mop head is so large that it won't fit into any reasonably-sized mop bucket. And there's no easy way to wring out even some of the water. So, when you mop using water, the mop leaves alot of water behind. It takes forever for the floor to dry. A possible method would be to use your kitchen sink, and press it along the side, but I'm not thrilled about using my kitchen sink as a mop bucket. Or I suppose one could dip the pad in the mop water by hand, wring it out, and then attach it to the mop head.... but even if I was willing to put my hands in mop water, it seems like we've lost alot of efficiency here. A simple, wring-able mop. What does it take???"
5,Long Way Home....,"the first time i heard and seen the video of ""Long Way Home"", it was in MTVASIA. I didnt like the song at first.. i didnt think it was that catchy. But the second time i heard it, i liked it. ""Long Way Home"" is one of the great songs that Speed has ever perform, in my opinion. The other song ""Confusion"" is good too, but nothing compared to ""long way home"" or any other songs of SPEED."
2,From aztec altars to the sufi big mac syndrome,"I wasn't aware that 'sacrifice' was a sufi teaching, and Mr. Gold's Crowley routine should have told him 'sacrifice' is a phoney spirituality. But then Crowley sacrificed a frog. What's Mr. Gold's game here? The public has a right to know. Hohum,the 'work' of fleecing the multitude must go on.We need more information here. Sacrifice is the wilful of destruction of human beings, more sophisticated spiritual interpretations notwithstanding. How does this work out in practice with Mr. Gold's 'groupies'? We need a new kind of private eye to track the fate of the victimes here. These sufis are clever. You will never catch them on the ordinary police beat.Capiche? There really is a sufi mafia, you know."
5,Perfect purchase,"This is a great product. Took care of the problem. My puppy began gaining weight immediately after the first dose. Also: She didn't mind the taste, unlike similar products I've tried."
1,Disappointing,"The hit songs you thought you were going to hear are poorly recorded live versions sung too fast, the others are dumb songs you never heard and most don't even make you feel like dancing. There are 1 or 2 good songs, that's it. Not worth buying."
2,A collection of banalities,"Norton's assertions about her own history, soul, and mental states might as well have been taken out of a feminist literary criticism textbook - they are absolutely predictable and femisitically-correct, and thus come off as rehearsed conformities rather than genuine discoveries of self. This affection to stereotype marks every single page of the book, every chapter - Norton doesn't care to see beyond Stetson hats, cowboys and bars, really. The Notebook chapters are a series of well-crafted nature observation, but they only intersperse the main narrative, and the short relief they provide is not enough to dispell the numbing effect of the general tone of the book."
5,Great series,"This is only the fifth in the series of 15 graphic novels for this series and there are some great single stories here, but the value of this series is in the whole series. It is in my opinion the best Japanese Manga series available. It's overall story is close to earth with no robots or aliens and the problems encountered are true to life, which makes this such a great series. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a great Manga series that is touching, romantic and heart warming."
2,Why I Bought This Petty Excuse Of An Album,"This album states on the back ""At long last The Clash's entire catalog has been remastered..."" This is definitely not their entire catalog. It's not even a greatest hits. This majority of this album is interviews with the band members. The rest are songs not worth metioning. Yes it has White Riot, Rock The Casbah, and Train In Vain, but London Calling and Should I Stay Or Should I Go are absent. Out of the 24 tracks on the disc, 13 are interviews. That's more than half. Stay away from this pile of festering punk."
2,Too large,"I have many of the knives listed with this product, but they all shook around a lot in the case. I even tried a leatherman wave and wasn't happy, so I returned it."
2,sadly disappointed .... (:-,"First of all I purchased the game at a NEW price, as I selected from the items available, but received a used one. The case was cracked and upon loading the game found initials of players high scores on the score screen. The game itself is slow, out of balance, (re: the ""pac-man"" icon is way too slow to outplay the ""ghost"" icons. They are set way out of the normal speeds for the game to be played with any enjoyment. It is playable if you like to play out of sync. Not happy with the seller or the product."
4,"Item was great, but different that pictured","Item is actually a grey color, not black as shown in the picture. That being said, matched theQuartet ADA Approved Men's Restroom Sign, Wheelchair Accessible Symbol with Tactile Graphics, Molded Plastic, 6 x 9 Inches, Gray (01416)sign exactly, so it worked great in my restaurant.Worked out great in my case, but if you were looking for a black sign, you might have been disappointed."
3,Not quality but quantity,"Make no mistake. This is a 5-star performance. You might not, but I certainly do enjoy immensely piano redactions of symphonic works--or in some cases the original piano version that was later fleshed out with orchestration (e.g. Gershwin's original 2 piano version of ""An American in Paris""). There is a rival four-hands piano rendition of ""Rite"" on Naxos that is in every respect as good as this 2-hand setting by Sam Raphling. But with a running time of only 30:15 minutes, even at Delos' mid-price asking, one would wish for a more generous offering with some added pieces such as Stravinsky's selections from ""Petrushka"" to round out the CD. Still if you must have this pianist or this piece, by all means expect a good performance."
5,The Motor City Madman,Ted Nugent as always delivers high powered rock and roll. This one has all the classic hits as well as live gems too. It is a must for every rockers collection. I highly recommend this cd and check out the rest of Nuges cds
4,great album,"The only reason i don't give it a 5 is because it doesn't have all the greatest hits of ted nugent. His music is so great, he never dissapoints, just listen to that guitar. I would really recommend this cd to anyone who likes music. This is music you should listen to."
2,"same theme, different versions","here is a great list of brain-free (or brianless, if you will) songs celebrating 70's hair -metal with BIG riffs.......lyrics are as expected, useless filler for the guitar & bass........seems very good after a few drinks, otherwise this will wear you down from the ""i've heard this before"" deja-vu element of gonzo songs........def leppard is infinitely better.....and they are not an absolute fruitcake in real life like ted.............."
