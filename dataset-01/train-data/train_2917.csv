1,I would return it if I could....,"I bought this for our office and I think its universally hated. I'd like to think we just got a lemon.As you pour water into the top filter, whether the machine is on or off, or the filter closed or open doesn't matter. The machine starts brewing anyway, and spills coffee everywhere.The pot is poorly designed, and also spills coffee EVERY single time. I think we've spent more on paper towels than we have on coffee. Awful machine."
1,Rating of product,Did not like this product. Too much trouble. Went back to Mr. Coffee. Was not simple to operate and required too many steps to make coffee.
1,Complete disappointment,"I can only blame myself for making an impulse buy, but this product receives a 1-star for three reasons:1. The Velocity Brew is made in China. I went Bunn because I thought I was buying American.2. It demands energy all of the time. I would prefer a coffee maker that takes longer to brew and doesn't need to warm water at all times. It seems like a complete waste of energy.3. It's not suited for left-handed people! The coffee pot only has the cup-levels labeled on one side...the side you would see if you reached for it with your right hand."
2,BUNN Velocity Brew--Slower than a Mule,"When I first received the product, it looked great and worked good for about 6 weeks, then it got slower and slower, then it started running too much water through. Now, it takes over half-an-hour to make a pot of coffee. I would not recommend purchasing this model of Bunn. Very disappointed."
4,Bunn brewer--looks like a winner. Haven't had a chance to put it into service at the office yet.,"We use a one cup brewer and the Bunn brewer, however, this one has not been put into service yet. In the past, I have never had trouble with a Bunn brewer and expect this one to have the same track record."
1,Sooooo Slow!,"I work for a small company where I am the one making these little purchases like a new coffee maker. This Bunn is extremely slow! The coffee is made at about 7:30am but it is at least 3:00pm before it is finished brewing! This cannot be normal, otherwise I'm not quite sure how Bunn is such a well-known, and frankly, expensive brand. Very disappointed!"
1,TOTAL JUNK,"WORST COFFEE POT CARAFE LEAKS ALWAY HEATS WATER WASTE OF ENERGYBUNN NHBX-B(D) Generation High Altitude10-Cup Home Pourover Coffee Brewer, Black"
2,"BUNN NHBX-B Contemporary 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black","The Bunn coffeemaker provides coffee within 3-4 minutes, which is great. However, when you pour a cup of coffee, it drips on the cabinet. I would not buy this product again. I don't think it is worth the price and I am very disappointed.BUNN NHBX-B Contemporary 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black"
2,coffee maker,"Well...This isn't really what I wanted. You see I purchased this for a Birthday present for my Mother. And I wanted the one with the warmer on the bottom. But, she said it was ok. I didn't want the hassel to return it either. So I guess it is ok."
5,I should have bought one years ago!!,"After many years of getting by with other brands of coffee makers that were cheaper but didn't work well or long, I finally bought this Bunn. I should have bought one years ago!! Quick, works great, great tasting coffee, well worth the extra money!!"
2,coffeelover,Just bought the Bunn to replace cuisinart with an electrical problem. Very disappointed in the design of the carafe. It is impossible to pour a cup without it leaking all over the counter. I'll never buy this brand again.
3,"slightly disappointed, keeping it anyway","I bought this and within a month the warmer went out on it. I returned it and was happy that Amazon sent me a replacement. However, I had to pay the shipping on the return and amazon only gave me a $9.00 credit on the shipping that cost me $18.00 UPS. So that is another disappointment. I have Amazon Prime so I feel as if that was very unfair. I like the Bunn coffee maker, It makes a very good cup of coffee. Hope the warmer doesn't go out again! If it does, you all will hear about it!"
4,Loud at times but does the work,"When my old Bunn did not keep the brewed coffee hot enough, I looked for a replacement. This ""Velocity Brew"" unit does a good job of brewing and keeping the coffee or just tea water at an acceptable temperature. It is so fast you must use the higher lipped Bunn filters, otherwise the grounds for strong coffee get hung up on the generic filter edges, making a mess. The top plate that one must turn to fill the reservoir seems a bit fragile, but the large area exposed does keep the pouring water from spilling everywhere. Sometimes, but not too often, the heating seems awfully loud. I also noticed that the plastic rim on the coffee pot hugs the glass in such a way that sometimes when in a hurry to just pour a cup too fast, the coffee dribbles over the side instead of staying in the stream to fill the cup. However, I have gotten used to all of the little quirks and am quite satisfied now. The unit also is nice looking on my counter."
2,Not the same,"After previous purchases of Bunn Coffee Makers, I had high expectations of getting another one. This particular product was not what I was expecting in appearance and performance. The plastic parts are cheaply made and the burner does not keep coffee as hot as I would like it to be. I usually end up microwaving it to get it warmer. And for the life of me, I, nor my husband, can pour a cup of coffee from the included carafe without spilling coffee all over the place. The inside of the lid of the carafe holds way to much moisture, and I usually get alot of condensation poured into my cup before the actual coffee. I didn't save the box or receipt, or I would be sending it back. Way too much money for this poor product. I'm getting my old Mr. Coffee out of the garage and using it instead."
1,Not what I expected,"Purchased a Bunn so we could get hot, good coffee. This was a huge disappointment - sometimes the coffee was ""ok""....which is about the nicest thing I can say. Several times the coffee came out muddy and barely warm. I ended up using nearly twice as much coffee as we use in the Cuisinart (we keep 2 coffee makers as one drinks regular and one drinks decaf) and still the coffee was muddy and weak. Amazon was incredible though - I was issued a full refund immediately. In the future I will not hesitate to buy anything through Amazon!"
5,Best Brew Around!,"After having bought two of these previously as gifts, and because my husband is a coffeeholic, I decided to get him one as well. Shame on me for not having done it sooner. I first thought I would miss the timer feature so his coffee would be ready when he opened his baby blues each morning. This brews an entire pot in under 3 minutes! All the hubby has to do is add the water when he gets up, stumble over for his coffee cup, grab his specs and back to the coffee pot and his first 4 cups are piping hot and aromatic and waiting on him to pour.The coffee even has a richer taste than what most coffee makers produce. This is a definite winner!! OH, one more thing....the first Bunn I bought, I purchased at a retail store. The second one I purchased at an online store. The one I just bought, HERE, for my hubby was the lowest price yet!!"
1,Good if you like really weak coffee with grounds floating in it.,"Paid over $100.00 for it because we wanted a good quality coffee maker and Bunn has a great reputation for high quality coffee makers. It does make a pot very fast, but it is very weak. If you put in more grounds to make stronger coffee, it will just flow over the basket and end up in your coffee. We tried a few different things to make it work right (including buying new filter baskets, using less water w/ more grounds etc) but no luck, its still way too weak for my taste. It doesn't matter if you you buy Folgers or grind your own Pete's beans it all tastes the same, like weak Denny's coffee. Very disappointed, was returned and the $20.00 Mr. Coffee that never let me down came out from the basement. It still makes the best coffee!"
5,Bunns are #1,This is just another one in a long line of superior Bunn coffee makers. It seems that I will buy this brand only for the rest of my life.
2,Back to Walmart for me!!,"I only got this because Walmart was out of the model that I have been hooked on for years. Even thought this one is supposedly an upgrade, and was originally more expensive, I find the $99.00 quick brew Bunn the best coffee pot I have ever used and will go back to it once this one wears out. The problem with this one is the problem that happens with ALL Bunns when they are about to die. You have to put in 10 cups of water to get 8 cups of coffee. But it should NOT be happening with a brand new pot. I am just too lazy and coffee dependent to pack it up and send it back, and, what the hey, it was on sale too. Live and learn - you really DO get what you pay for..."
5,Bunn 10-cup Home coffee brewer is fantastic,"The Bunn 10-cup home coffee brewer makes coffee fast, taste great and is always hot. This is my 3rd coffee brewer and you just can not beat these coffee brewers.( They last for years as an added bonus) I rate it A+ I am very satisfied with this product. I recommend this one to anyone who loves great coffee."
2,Not a good design,We have always heard that Bunn coffeemakers were very good and are used by restaurants. We ordered our first one without any hesitation. We were disappointed with our first pot of coffee. We decided not to be hasty in judging it so we continued to make coffee in it for 5 days. Then we knew it was never going to work for us and we returned it. Here's why: We like HOT coffee. The coffee never got very hot. Next we hated the 'reservoir' that was always being re-filled and went 24/7 to keep it hot....but it never kept it hot. We also 'hated' the design of the lid that had to be slid back and forth. The warming plate never stayed warm. Actually there was not one thing we liked about this coffeemaker. We went back to our previous brand that we loved...a Cuisinart. We have hot coffee again and it's good coffee and we love it.
2,Bunn Contemporary Coffee Brewer,"I just replaced our Bunn Contemporary Coffee Brewer with a Bunn ""Orignal"" design. The contemporary model has a rotating cover at the top of the water resovoir that I believe is the source of the slowness problem and it cannot be cleaned with the wire spring affair that came with the original model. We have hard water and after about three months the contemporary model started slowing down to where it now takes 20 minutes to get a pot of coffee. There are problems with this model that had not been worked out yet."
1,Coffee maker,This is the worst coffee making product I have ever bought. Do not waste your money on this. It is not up the standard I was used to with their other coffee makers.
4,Good job,I was very happy with my Bunn Coffee Brewer. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is very nosy when the water is warming. The one I had before was not that nosy.
2,Not worth the money,I bought this because of the spray head but I realized after visiting bestbuy that there were other cheaper/better units with similar water dispersion. Live and learn.
4,good coffee,Gift for my husband who gets up early and loves the coffee from this new Bunn pot....worth the money!
4,"A great cup of coffee, with minimal time and effort","If you are looking for a simple to use coffee pot, that makes a great cup of coffee, look no further. Some machines may have various gadgets etc, the Bunn has always been simple, and easy to use, and most importantly makes a great cup of coffee, plus the machine is built to last. Just make sure you read the instructions before using."
4,It's a Bunn,"I've had this coffee maker for several months, it's the third Bunn product I've owned and I wouldn't buy any other coffee maker. I don't like the revolving filler lid as well as the flip up lid on my previous model, but I like the looks of it and it makes a great cup of coffee."
2,BUNN ain't what it used to be.,"I always had a Bunn coffee maker. My 5 yr old Bunn GR10 finally lost its ability to maintain a hot cup of coffee. The new NHBX 10 is the replacement. Bunn claims that the internal water temp is 200 degrees and is at the ideal level for perfect brewed coffee. I measured the water temp in the carafe and it was 180 degrees. The coffee is not hot enough. In hindsight, knowing what I know now, I would not buy this, as my coffee is not super hot and does not stay hot. If you want hot coffee, buy a commercial coffeemaker. Stay away from consumer grade coffee makers."
5,Best Little Bunn In Reno,"This is our third Bunn coffee maker,and I think this one is the best. The coffee is good and hot, you can't beat a pot of joe in 3 minutes, and there is no funky new taste. We had bought two other brands, and we can't get rid of the new taste. We will always use Bunn."
5,Bunn Home Coffee Brewer,"I have used Bunn cofee makers for years and this was to replace one that I had used for about 15 years. It is every bit as good as the old one was but with some nice additional features. I would recommend it to any one looking to either add or replace a coffee maker. It makes excellent coffee in just a few minutes, no waiting for the water to heat and then go through a ten to fifteen minute cycle prior to having fresh coffee ready. If you will note this is the coffee maker used by the majority of restaurants and nearly everyone loves their coffee."
4,BUY A BUNN,VERY PLEASED WITH THE QUICK DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT AND I HAVE ALWAYSLOVED MY BUNN COFFEE POT. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE!
5,Bunn NHBX-B coffee brewer,It doesn't get any better than this. Who needs a timer when your coffee is brewed this quick. Outstanding coffee maker!
4,Bunn 10-cup coffee maker to replace a 12 year old Bunn,This was purchased to replace a 12 year old Bunn coffee maker that just wore out. Not bad----12 years of daily use and it made an excellent pot of coffee in less than 5 minutes. I'm looking forward to the same great experience with the Bunn I just purchased.
1,RIP OFF,"This machine is VERY difficult to use. Decanter pours all over except where coffee or water is supposed to go, design of pot is terrible. I read the instructions, did what was instructed to do. My $10 machine made a better tasting stronger coffee. Dont waste your money. I sure did !"
1,What a disappointment!,"What an absolute disappointment! I purchased this coffee maker based on representations that the water would be heated to 200 degrees, the recommended temperature for brewing good coffee. I was thrilled at the thought of getting HOT coffee that tasted like coffee, instead of lukewarm coffee that was weaker than most teas. Thinking I had not done the initial fill procedures correctly, I emptied everything, washed everything out, and started all over again. When that still didn't make a difference, I decided to see how hot the water really was. I was shocked to discover that the water NEVER registered higher than 170 degrees."
4,Bunn NHBX-B makes great coffee!,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our old one, which was on the fritz. At first I was disappointed to see it didn't have a pause and serve feature, but then I realized since it only takes 3 minutes to brew the coffee, you really don't need the feature! Also, the coffee it makes is so much better than our old coffee maker. It's very smooth; whereas our prior 2 coffee makers made coffee that tasted somewhat bitter. The only thing that would have made me like it a little bit more, is if you could pour the water in the night before. With this model, you open the lid, turn on the warmer plate, pour in the water and when you shut the lid the coffee starts brewing. A small price to pay for great coffee!"
2,disappointed,Very disappointed with this product. Had used bunn products for years in the restaurant business. So when I saw this advertised for home I jumped on it. The coffee tastes very good but the end temperature is only around 170. The price of this coffee maker is around 100 dollars. For 19.95 I can get a Mr coffee with the same end temperature. Also the warming plate is so poor that within minutes the coffee temperature drops to 160.
2,Bunn coffee maker,The top is not secure when pouring cofeee. It spills all over! Not very happy with this model. My first Bunn lasted 10 years.
4,my 2nd version of a Bunn,Great coffeemaker. Like the new system of filling from carafe and starting drip when cover is closed. Only negative is the new design carafe. Slow pour or drip all over. Substiteted my older rounded style and it works and pours faster to my cup. Just hand me my coffee qand nobody gets hurt!!
4,After 10 years-just purchased our 2nd Bunn,"Our first Bunn Coffee Maker lasted 10 years, we loved it. It stopped heating earlier this week so we went out and purchased a new one. Works as good as the last one, however one BIG problem, I am not sure what they did to the coffee decanter itself to redesign, or why or if they don't have quality control--but every time we pour coffee it leaks all over. Not happy about this at all--good thing we have our old Bunn Decanter, we will be using that."
5,Excellent product,"Love this product. I always wanted a Bunn and this is exactly as I expected. It brews my 3 cups of coffee in about 2 minutes and it is nice and smooth tasting. You won't be sorry with the Bunn. There is no timer if you're the kind that like the coffee ready when you get up. But just pour the water in, use the bathroom and it will be ready when you come out."
5,gREAT COFFEE MAKER,WORKS GREAT!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! BREWS A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE!!! CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS COFFEE MAKER!!! gET ONE TODAY!!!
2,"BUNN NHBB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black (Kitchen)",The warmer doesn't keep the coffee hot. Have to use the microwave to heat the coffee. Do not buy this product.
3,Good but not your typical Bunn.,"Replased my old model after 8 years with this one, looks great, much more contemporary but just like other reviews forwarned, it makes VERY weak coffee. Extra grounds are needed for a bit stonger cup and that was not the case with my older standard Bunn. I suspect that b/c of the fast brew time, water is dispersed to the grounds quicker, thus not allowing for flavors to be extracted slowly from the grounds. I'd rather wait the extra 2 minutes for a stronger and better tasting cup, especially with coffee being as expensive as it is. I'm very brand loyal to Bunn as they make a great coffee maker that will last for years but in hindsight, I wish I had went with a different model. Too late to return it now so I'm trading this one with a friend for a different Bunn."
5,Great Bunn,"As you would think a Bunn should be. Everything works great. The top slides to the side for pouring and then back to actuate the water into the heater. I use a pitcher from a previous Bunn to pour the water in. It wouldn;t make a difference, the water does not go in until the top is slid back over the opening. My wife likes the stainless design."
3,Well Researched Book,"This book of Concept Cars by Richard Dredge is well researched. He seems to include photos and information for almost every concept car made by automakers throughout the world in the last 20 years.The photos used throughout the book are less than wonderful, however. The photos, large in size for each car, is fuzzy with no studio lighting used or color correcting to make each image appear it's best. The same car photos are also used in his smaller book, Dream Cars. This 4"" x 6"" format book is a great size for resolution of the cars photographed. But don't stand up when used in this larger format book here. Great reading though!"
1,Looks can be deceiving,What I got is not what is presented on the website. NOT 5 pieces but two small strips. Product also arrived room temprature. Scary when it's raw meat!
5,great stuff,"Huey P. Long, who dared to even fake an assasination attempt on himself, is one of those great American originals and here we have him in all his color and charm, his wit and power. A book that truly tells his tale and tells it well so the reader never puts it down. A good contribution.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,Strangely Flat,"There is something strangely flat about this biography of Huey Long. I agree with the other (at this point, three) reviewers in the author's focus on a relatively short period of Long's life, the lack of insight into Long's psychology, the uninspired prose, and a certain shallowness. White was, all in all, unsatisfying.I came to the subject of Long from Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men, a magificent fictional treatment of Long and his minions. It inspired me to learn more about him, but, I fear, that Kingfish was not the best choice. I think that I might attempt William's biography, but it is more likely that I would re-read All the King's Men."
2,A Tale of Two Parkers,"I have a personal rule against reviewing a book I have not read in its entirety. In this case, however, I feel compelled (at roughly a third of the way in) to say that this book is just badly written, cut my losses and move on.The story structure is erratic and disjointed. The author refers to some persons by their first name, some by their last name and some by both alternately. And I challenge anyone to read page 39 and tell me who the hell ""Parker"" is. The parker that comes to mind at this moment is Dorothy who once said something along the lines of , ""This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force""."
3,"Interesting life, but a hard study for a biography","A biography of Huey Long is going to be dominated by one thing: his megalomaniacal desire for power. It makes for interesting reading in political tactics, but that's really all there was to his life. White is even-handed in his handling with his treatment of Long's excesses, but his prose is a little clunky and repetitive. The problem with a biography on Long (or perhaps just this biography on Long) is that there is little to texture the overally picture of a power-hungry man. There is no underlying complex character to understand. A recommended read for those seeking to understand the dangers of power to excess or people with a romantic attachment to the state of Louisiana or the 1930s."
3,"Great old songs, but...","I was really looking forward to hearing Norah singing covers, or duets at least, of these songs from the track listings where she is listed as a co-artist on all of the songs. Not sure why she is listed as an artist, as she doesn't sing on any of the songs. Nice (mostly) old collection of music that she evidently picked out, but without being familiar with the Artist's Choice series there was know way to know that she didn't actually participate. The track listings on the Amazon page are misleading to say the least. Obviously I should have listened to the samples first, but I knew these songs, as I already have most of them in my collection. I also knew Norah would have done a great job on them if she had actually sung on any of the tracks. Oh well, glad I didn't buy it new. Four star collection of music, downgraded by a star for a deceptive Amazon webpage."
5,"Thanks, Norah!","I agree with the previous reviewer; this has become a regular in my car cd wheel. The mix is nicely sequenced, includes one great singer after another, and definitely tells you something about the ""roots"" of NoJo and the Handsome Band. Please do another one!"
2,Not at all what I thought it would be,"I thought this CD would be Norah Jones SINGING these songs. Instead it was songs she liked, but sung by the original artists. Very misleading!!! Not very good either."
2,A selection of her favorites.,This was not what I expected. The songs were sung by the artist who made them famous and very little Nora Jones.
2,Cover design kills good case,"This case is awesome for protection, very nicely design, feels tough. But when I actually had to use the PDA, the cover just got in the way too much, and became a big annoyance.The front cover for this case flips down. So when you want to access the PDA, you have two ways of holding it. One is with the cover dangling at the bottom of your device, banging into your palm. The other way is to fold the cover into the back, which is even worse since now the sharp inner edges are striking your palm, making using the PDA for a long time very uncomfortable if not unfeasible.The cutouts are also not very precise. Especially the mini usb connector. With the hinges in the way, I had to try very hard each time to push the cable in whenever I need to sync or recharge.Overall, I don't recommend this case."
4,Supberb Sibelius,"This would rate five stars except that the sound, while very good for the time, is somewhat dated. Collins was apparently little known in the U.S. although I recall seeing the lp's during my college days in the 60's. His performances don't wear their hearts on their sleeves but bring out the evocative quality of Sibelius as well as any I've heard. Worth seeking out."
3,Not for beginners&#65533;,"I bought this CD at a jewish music festival in London. It's something of a collector's piece; interesting if you are fairly familier with the genre, but possibly a little obscure and repetitive for 'novices'. It's compiled from old recordings and has a nice authentic and scratchy feel. It's particularly interesting to compare treatments of certain songs with those on other early klezmer CDs. These men could really play."
4,I have most of them!,"yes i went buns of steel crazy...and honestly everything of steel crazy. if you plan on doing the same i wouldnt reccomend it. they are all very simular. but i loved the original buns of steel- it was a hoot! i could barely do the exercise from laughing at gregory's comments. still that one was the best in terms of workouts, tamilees are kind of short...still wouldnt be a bad purchase to have an abs, buns and arms of steel."
2,Didn't care for it.,"I thought I was a fan of alternative music. This entire collection wasn't what I expected. Only one song on each CD that I recognized, and the other songs were OK, but no great find."
3,Good beats but rookie lyrics,The beats on the cd display some great Southern funk. The hard bass will keep you parlaying all night long. The lyrics on the other hand leave something to be desired. The highlight is on the disc is tne song Mafia and Me. This is an instance where both the beats ands lyrics are top notch.
5,Kyolic excellent product when you want garlic,My friends have told me about the benefits of Garlic powder but I was afraid that it would give me bad breath. I am happy to say that this product didnt do that.
1,Trash,"Purchased 2, only one came. Quality was bad, stitching a mess and there was even a hole in the shirt. Spoke to seller who told me these were cheaply made shirts and was surprised I expected better quality for what I had paid.... He said I could return the shirt with hole and get a new one BUT per their return instrustions, on all returns, I (the purchaser) was to pay for the shipping to get it back to them including insurance. At that point I would have paid more total for the shipping than the shirt. Told him to just cancel the order and he told me I would not be fully refunded.Have never had a problem with a vendor on here before. Amazon was helpful but had to go through a mess to get this solved. Stay away from these guys."
5,A wild ride!,"The stories in this collection are so gripping and intense, the characters are so disturbingly real. I loved watching the wildly edgy scenes play out like a film in my mind. This is a superb read that I highly recommend!!"
4,Great Pasta,"The product is fine, but the delivery was not on time and I had to go out and buy pasta for the dinner party I ordered this for. Major bummer when I couldn't return it ... not sure why that was but it's a good thing it has shelf life I guess."
5,Really Good,This is a great quality poster with good colors and clarity that is well framed. It makes for an excellent presentation.
1,Lousy Vendor,I purchased (4) posters for Christmas from this vendor and I received (4) posters that were all wrong. Now I need to get either a refund or get the posters I ordered. It was a terrible disappointment for my son and I...was so excited about these items! How does something like this happen with something so simple. Worse things in life......
2,"Love it or hate it, no middle ground","LeAnn has a fabulous voice and does a technically great job, but heart/spirit/something seems to be missing. If you love the old classics, this is for you. I prefer her newer stuff, and Big Deal while good can not carry the album."
2,Why the remakes?,"This album is full of remakes. Why? It seems to me that LeAnn made this album to try to stay ahead of Britney Spears in terms of success from record sales. Although LeAnn enjoys more success than any other female teenager, this album is just not the way to go. LeAnn is a great singer and her determination to compete against a new wave of teenagers like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera should be respected, but this album is just way out of line and definately should not come from a teen idol."
1,I wish i didn't have to give it any stars at all!,"I hate this album, to say it succinctly. She ruins all the old songs and the new ones aren't any better. She needs to take a look at her creer and choices of music. If she doesn't come up with something new, this may be her last album."
2,someone help her -- quick!,"Immense talent is both a gift and a great responsibility, and those who understand that seek guidance from masters to use it well. LeAnn Rimes obviously possesses the talent; it's the guidance that's lacking. Apart from a few bright spots (the single ""Blue""), her discography is confusing and, in many cases, unfortunate. In this latest release, she doesn't yet have the emotional or vocal maturity to bring anything unique to this collection of covers -- it's a rather pedestrian tribute to her influences. There's no denying her voice is something amazing, but there are plenty of beautiful voices in the world singing the wrong material already. Here's hoping she gets some real help before the next CD, otherwise a release filled with more ""Purple Rain"" ilk is a distinct possibility."
1,Not worth even 1 dollar,I wouldn't pay a dollar for this CD since so many songs are remakes. We can find these songs anywhere else! Sing new songs LeAnn!
1,Not very good,"I just couldn't get used to this album...the singing wasn't as good as some of Leann's other albums. I like most of Leann's albums, but this album wasn't as good as some of the others."
1,"Bad, Bad ,Bad","This is an album to avoid. The songs are corny and heartless with too much bravado. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
1,Horrible!,"LeAnn has not enough talent and tends to screech and yell. She is no comparison to Patsy Cline. I fyou want today Patsy cline, try Trisha Yearwood and Mandy Barnett. I can't believe she actually landed a record deal. She has a quirky voice that is so annoying how can anybody stand it! Do Not Buy! Do Not support her!"
5,Rips your heart out!,"The Songs ""Its Cryin time again"",""Shes got You"" and ""Crazy"" are recorded with such passion coming from LeAnn Rimes that is just rips out your heart. They have such a somber and morose overtone that you somehow want to crawl through the speakers and comfort this aching soul. This album is a collection of golden age country standards. Listening to this album transports you to its world from which it came. You can just hear these songs being played at some small diner jukebox in South Carolina in about 1958. Leanns voice is nothing short than amazing and she belts out these tunes with such power and feeling that it can actually compare with Patsy Cline or Loretta Lynn. I seriously recommend this album and for the low price there is no reason to pass it up."
3,"Her voice is strong, maturing.","It was only a matter of time before LeeAnn did this album, she's been compared with Patsy Cline from day one. She's not, of course and maybe doesn't quite make the sound of Patsy Cline, but she sure makes the sound of LeeAnn Rimes and that ain't bad. Her voice is maturing."
2,She's no Patsy Cline,"I really enjoy Lee Ann, but this albulm is nothing but a Patsy Cline remake, almost the whole albulm. I am the greastest fan of Patsy Cline & I have the original, which is the greatest. If you like these songs, try the real deal with a LEGEND of country."
1,I'm a HUGE LeAnn Rimes fan but this....,"has to be the worst CD I have heard in a long time! She has such a BEAUTIFUL voice and to waste it on songs that someone else had made a hit is getting OLD. She should become more original and sing her own song. She's a talented young woman but enough is enough! If your interested in getting one of her albums go buy ""BLUE"". That one is the best out of all her albums! Please LeAnn if your reading this SING YOUR OWN SONGS!"
2,She should leave Patsy's music ALONE!!!,"The album is ok, but she should have never tried to remake Patsy Cline's music. These songs are identified with one of the greatest singers of our time! LeAnn sounds silly singing CRAZY and even worse singing I FALL TO PIECES!! Next time LeAnn try something original!!"
1,No More!,"I am so sick of remakes by this girl! She's always going around saying that songwriting is one of her favorite hobbies. I have yet to hear anything she's written. Not to mention that I think her voice is horrible. One second she's so low you can't hear her and the next she's screeching loud enough to break glass. If you know what's good for you, don't buy ANY of her stuff!"
2,Not her best work,"I am a big time county fan. LeAnn Rimes does not do these classic songs justice. Too whiny and too LeAnn-ish. If you want to hear Leavin on Your Mind done right, pick up Lori Morgans CD. She sings it beautifully. The only song I really like is Big Deal. So I think Ms. Rimes should stick to singing new songs. We have Blue, and still enjoy listening to it."
4,"LeAnn, you're outta sight!","I found this CD to be a good showcase for LeAnn's amazing vocal talent. Her voice makes me melt every time. The selection was a bit disappointing, in that there were no original titles. I want to cringe when I hear Me and Bobby McGee! It was bad when Janis Joplin did it, and it's bad now. But wow, the vocals on Lovesick Blues blow me away. LeAnn has talent out of this world. This is a great collection of classics, sung by the most gorgeous voice in country music."
2,Connie and Patsy,"LeAnn reminds me so much of a style of two great singers, one pop and one country. Connie Francis and Patsy Cline were naturals. Each song they recorded were sung with true emotion. LeAnn, I believe, has been compared to both of these great artisits, but she lacks their depth and this album is an example of it. To be fair, I don't think any artist can produce the natural feelings of Connie and Patsy."
1,Big Deal.....,"This album is a waiste of money..The only good song on this CD is Big Deal. LeAnn has such a pretty voice, why dosn't she sing her own songs rather someone else's hit. Her first album ""Blue"" is the best so far in LeAnn's carrer."
1,No Creativity,Leann needs to get her own material.. anyone can make hits out of already proven material. She needs to go back to pop and leave country alone. Trying to do Patsy Cline is a terrible mistake for her. If you can't do it better don't do it at all. And no one can do it better than Patsy Cline.
2,Talent is not enough.,"LeAnn has a tremendous amount of talent but in order to find her identity she must sing songs that not only apply to her life but also are fresh material. I hate the fact that she remakes songs that are prevously Identified with other singers. She dose a nice job, but I seem to get the impression that she thinks she can do it better. She cant because those songs along with their artist are legends and thats somthing that has to be earned by being great. Talent is not enough."
1,LeAnn Rimes album by the same title,I bought this CD and find the production most irritating. The instruments are out front while LeAnn's vocals are in the background. I keep wanting to turn down the music and turn up the vocals. A good selection of songs.
2,Very Patchy,"In the movie ""La Bamba"" is a scene where Ritchie Valens is recording ""Donna"" - he thinks it's fine first take , but the producer makes him do it over and over. Take 15 (I think) stands out as the best take by far. This is a lesson a lot of artists could use. Leann needs a new producer. The vocals on some songs are just annoying - she adds ""H's"" at the start of words beginning with vowels - ""H'im Crazy""... this drove me nuts ! Mandy Barnett's album ""I've got a right to cry"" was produced with Owen Bradley (Patsy Cline's Producer) just before he died. It is a mile better than this and contains no Patsy Cline remakes. Leann was way better on ""Blue"" and has gone downhill ever since. Save your money until she gets a record producer other than her dad."
5,great as always,"LeAnn has one of the best voices ever in any kind of music, she can sing anything she wants to and sounds great. so far two thumbs up on anything she has done."
5,Nothing to say but...wow!,"I've been a LeAnn fan since 1996, and each time I buy one of her CDs she amazes me with her voice. ""Blue"" just blew everyone away, ""Unchained Melody"" was a chance to hear LeAnn from really young and was an instant # hit, ""You Light Up My Life"" was a proven #1 by 3 Billboard charts, ""Sittin On Top Of The World"" had an expansion from old time country to pop & was the majority fans favorite. Now there's ""LeAnn Rimes"" the best of country oldies. Besides each album's success, it holds LeAnn's strong voice.LeAnn had the honor of going to record Patsy Cline songs. Not just any artist could do that. The best part of this album is that LeAnn didn't want to change any of the songs, or make them better. She gave tribute to these country artists...without them country wouldn't have got a great start. From ""Crazy"" to her country top ten ""Big Deal"" and ""Me & Bobby McGee"", you won't be a dissapointed country fan by purchasing this album."
2,What's happening here?,"I had high expectations for this CD. I'm disappointed. Is LeAnn trying to come back to the good graces of country or what? I agree that she needs to find some direction....but where? Allow me to say this; if anyone out there wants to hear someone sing Patsy Cline's music, check out the soundtrack from the play ""Always, Patsy Cline"" recorded at the Ryman Auditorium wherein MANDY BARNETT will knock your socks off. You ain't heard nothin' yet!"
2,Enough already!!!,"She has a wonderful powerful voice, and to waste it on media hype is a shame! Singing a song originally FOR Patsy Cline (""Blue"") does not make you the next Patsy Cline. Let Leanne's talent speak for itself. If I wanted to hear these songs I would pull out the originals!!! Isn't it enough we have to endure RAPS bastardization of every hit song?!!"
2,Remakes and Covers and a Day in the Studio,"Ugh. Ramkes and covers. And it sounds like she spent half a day in the studio. I think this is a live album with no audience. Why does it sound like a rehearsal session? The only reason to buy this are the photos of LeAnn. I still think she's the prettiest singer. Yeah, I know your Britney Spears argument, but I'm from Missouri, alright? Anyways, not her best album."
2,Get Your Own Material,This album could have been good...could have. LeAnn needs to desperately record new material instead of constantly making money off other people's successes. Big Deal is the highlight. The rest is fluff. Plus never mess with Faded Love- it is the all-time best Patsy Cline song ever. You don't mess with a masterpiece.She may be compared to her....but she is NO PATSY CLINE.Why can't she just be LeAnn Rimes- is that not enough?
2,New LeAnn?,"This is the new LeAnn? This is her worst CD to date. I have no trouble with remakes, but this one sounds like it was put together in 2 days. Particularly bad are FADED LOVE, LOVESICK BLUES, and BOBBY MCGEE. Patsy and Janis must be rolling in their graves! LeAnn has a beautiful voice but when she strives for the power of Cline it destroys that beauty. LeAnn's fans deserve more for their money.!"
1,Not a good album at all...,"After listening to the songs, I knew something was missing from LeAnn's voice---emotion. She just doesn't have that break in her voice that makes it sound like she's actually hurting or even crying from getting her heart broken. Maybe it's because she's too young and not experienced. Patsy had that break in her voice, and so did Janis. But not LeAnn. She overcompensates for her lack of identification with the lyrics by overprojecting. Not all songs should be sung so loudly. Sorry, LeAnn---you should get rid of your father and find yourself a way better producer."
1,is this the best she can come up with?,"Yes LeAnn has a great voice, but it seems that with each new CD she puts out, i keep wondering if she will ever put out something more original and not these remakes. I want to hear music that hasn't already been done, from a girl who obviously has the voice to back it up...come on LeAnn"
3,not her best,"tracks 1-9 are great what spiols this album are the last 3 tracks. leann does not do LOVESICK BLUES justice,not enough yodel.ME AND BOBBY McGEE is dreadful,and as for BIG DEAL it's to pop should give this one to shania twain."
5,You can't explain how good it is!,"LeAnn has done remakes, and has done many new ones too. But LeAnn is the only current country singer today that can sing these old country classic hits! She has that strong beautiful emotional voice that does everything perfect! I love LeAnn Rimes, and can't wait for summer with her next release!"
5,Patsy Cline would be proud!,"LeAnn's voice has matured these past few years and she is now an amazing country singer (as always). I loved this album and it is so much fun to listen to! If you are a new country fan, buy this album to introduce yourself to all the classic songs. This album is great and I love LeAnn's voice. She is very talented and I think you all will agree!"
2,not so heavy duty,"I used this raingear for some commercial fishing in Alska, during a winter fishery. At first i was pleased, mainly for what it had cost me, i think the free shipping applied. The package got here in time. They didn't make it through the season before i had developed some leaks at the knee seam on both legs. The pvc shell material is lanmenated to pretty heavy cotton material much like the more costly Grundens gear. But on the jacket, this delamented at serveral spots. The jacket has plastic button closers, before the end of the seaon, two of these no loger remained closed. The bib pant also has light duty, plastic snaps, one of these broke during season. This gear may work fine for other types of activity, but commercaal fishing in Alaska is one of those. In the end i didn't save anything."
2,built in bra to be discussed,was disappointed by the built in bra. was hoping some underwire. I returned the item.
2,Presentation needs help!,"There was nothing particularly wrong with the actual product...it just needed some presentation help! There was NO packaging or tags attatched to the shirts. Therefore, they looked as if I'd purchased them used from a garage sale or thrift store. The company should at least shrink wrap the items so they appear to have come from a legitimate store!!"
3,DG Galleria re-issue,Mozart and Seifert? I think maybe Mozart and Karajan! Seifert hardly is in the picture! He almost blends into Karajan's orchestra! It's like he's just some guy they picked with no extra-ordinary talent.Poor job as a hornist doing some major horn concertos.(Best job on the orchestral parts I've heard so far though.)
4,Nice Bedtime Stories,"I have been reading this book to me son since he was three. The stories are presented in a short, but complete fashion that make this a really nice Bedtime Reading book."
4,Excellent for children 7 and under,"After looking for quite a while and having no luck finding a children's bible story book that was based only on the Old Testament and not geared towards Christianity, I was delighted to find this book. The stories are simplified and gentle but factual. The illustrations are some of the best I have ever seen. Excellent bed-time reading."
4,battery,it was very slow in getting here but great price for what you get..i would buy it again and tell other to buy it if they are looking for batteries.
2,One of the Batteries Went Dead in a Few Weeks,I received the item quickly and started using right away.After a couple weeks one of the batteries could not hold the charger anymore. The other one is ok.Tks
4,A COMPLEX LOOK AT THE NATURE OF LONGING AND LOVE,"I too read ""Christopher"" because of the favorable Los Angeles Times review and was not disappointed. The author's simplicity of style, combined with a slow burning, intriguing narrative ensured that the read was utterly compelling. It was one of those rare novels that demanded staying up until three in the morning to finish.I actually came onto Amazon to order a copy of ""Christopher"" for a friend's birthday gift and was totally amazed at some of the rather vicious customer reviews! One comment which particularly gnarled me was that the book was, ""really a very cynical book"". Which book did this reader read? The book I read was an extremely touching story about the need for and capacity to love, within even the most cynical of characters."
2,I Can't Recommend,"... My trouble is not so much with the premise, although I find nothing particularly fresh about the notion of an aging [alternative lifestyle person] pining for a young and attractive straight man, as with the structure and execution of character development. BK is, without doubt, an engaging and often amusing character. He is unfortunately the only identity within the novel that has been fully flushed out. The title character, Christopher, is so painfully flat and artificial that whenever he comes onto the ""scene"" I found myself wishing he'd leave again. Remaining characters are overall two dimensional. The structure of the novel is uneven and lacking in dramatic arc. I was disappointed by this work, and cannot recommend it here or to my peers."
2,Why So Loved?,"I am sorry to say that this is one of the most worst novels I've read in some time. ... Overall the story is fair, but the execution of character and story development are sloppy and underdeveloped. Please add my voice of reason to your online reviews. This book is not worth investing in. Thanks."
1,Sloppy,"... I was let down by the novel, particularly after what seemed like such a strong start. But within 60 pages I began to feel the slippage. Very sloppy construct, loose ends that never get addressed, some ... sketchy outlines of characters (and not just background characters, but like Christopher himself, mr. title character! There's no there, there!)... I could go on, but why? Don't misundertand me, Ms. Burnett has some potential, but I certainly can't recommend spending any money on this. ..."
1,"Silly, Poorly Done","I have to say I'm glad that this was a gift and not something I spent money on. I read a lot of fiction, some gay some more mainstream, and there is a class of gay fiction that is published and praised simply because of content, without much attention paid to literary quality. CHRISTOPHER is such a book. It reads like a student thesis project, primarily because of the absolutely convoluted and clunky structure. Didn't [Mr.] Burnett have an editor? There is much potential in the story (albeit it a bit trite), but the novel suffers from a lack of cohesion, thin character development, and some downright silly sequences that should have ended up on the ""cutting room floor."" Edit, edit, edit."
4,WONDERFUL FIRST EFFORT,"I've found myself extremely surprised and impressed with Mr. Allison Burnett's first novel, Christopher. I bought the book on a whim (I liked the image of the stubbed out cigarette on the cover) and now I'm extremely happy I did. The character of BK Troop was a fascinating study in cynicism that had me laughing out loud. Having lived in New York during the period the book takes place in, Mr. Burnett totally captures the nuances of an era. I found the story to be exceptionally entertaining and fresh. I would recommend this delightful work of fiction for anyone."
5,Brilliant,"I am in awe of this new writer. Allison Burnett's CHRISTOPHER is the best contemporary novel I've read in the past five years. It is witty, romantic, moving -- altogether brilliant. It is also very funny. CHRISTOPHER not only leaves you feeling changed -- as does all great literature -- but it also leaves you eagerly anticipating Burnett's second novel. In the meantime, one can only read CHRISTOPHER again and again."
1,BAD RIPPOFF,"THIS IS A BAD COPY OF THE 30th REUNION.THE 40th REUNION IS THE VIDEO YOU WANT.IT HAS 30th & 40th, WAY BETTER THAN THIS BAD COPY.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.........."
4,Contemporary Advertising,I had to buy this book for my advertising class. I actually don't mind reading it though. It is as interesting as a textbook can be.
1,DOES NOT COME BOUND,Paid over $60 for a book that came cut up and bound together by plastic zip ties..i would spend the extra money and get a book worth using
4,Great choice for family viewing,"This entertaining documentary really fits the bill for football fans - and for the families who follow and support high school athletes. It's the inside story of an entire season of championship football in Eastern PA. Infrequently, weak reality-TV camera work zeroes in too much on the less-than-inspiring star player. But overall, the story merits its current popularity in a medium thin on family choices."
5,First Hand Experience Against C.B. West,"Having played against C.B. West I know the dedication those players had for that great coach and that team. The tradition that team has develop over the past 30 years is breath taking! In 9th grade when USA Today ranked West #5 in the nation, and I first saw this team play, there was know way in the world you could have told me this was a high school team. The size, speed, and raw talent of those players were just unbelievable! West was just an unstoppable team all you could do was just watch in amazement. What a coach, Pettine was just top notch! Probably the best coach to ever coach the game at the high school level! What can I say about this movie! If you are any kind of sports fan get this movie! The lesson of football can be emulated to any game! Just go out and get this movie, it is truly amazing! Being a Pennsbury Guy! Go Falcons!(...)"
5,"this is the real thing, from start to finish","Having played on the North Penn team that lost to CB West in the film.(twice i might add:-(. I wanted to see the behind the scenes of that season and I was amazed at the entire movie. Personally to see that particular team and the perfection they had off the field, ABSOLUTE mistake free football I was amazed at how the players acted off the field. It was like watching two different worlds. It also shows how great of a coach Pettine Sr, really is. The movie is terrific in every aspect. If you like football and are a fan of high school football there is NO reason you shouldn't own this film."
4,The Pearl - Spark Notes,"`The Pearl: Spark Notes' is a short but pretty comprehensive study guide to this wonderful book by John Steinbeck. It has a plot overview, analysis of main characters, a section on themes, motifs and symbols, a chapter by chapter summary and analysis, important quotations, key facts, study questions and essay guides. There is also a quiz to see how much information you have retained. The style of writing is clear to read and the points raised are coherent and relevant. Most study guides follow a similar format, but if you want a engaging analysis of this book (that will offer a deeper insight into the story told) then this is a pretty good guide to buy.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,wrong artist?,"I believe this is a re-issue of Bolt Thrower's first album. HSB has stated that Bolt Thrower are heroes of theirs, so perhaps that's the confusion."
2,ho-hum,"This disc includes `40`s Superman (#01 Mad Scientist, #02 The Mechanical Monster, #03 Billion Dollar Limited, #04 The Artic Giant, #05 The Bulleteers, #06 The Magnetic Telescope), Woody Woodpecker (#04. Pantry Panic), Little Lulu (Cad & Caddy), Mighty Mouse (Wolf Wolf), Mutt & Jeff (Westwood Whoa, Slick Slueths), & Baby Huey (Pest Pupils, Quack A Doodle Do). There are also two additional cartoons (Cheese Burglar, Stupidsitious Cat).There's nothing really enduring here as these cartoons are more old than they are classic & don`t seem to have been restored at all. They won't challege more mature minds but they'd certainly be better veiwing for your 4-6 year-olds than the garbage on TV today."
4,Great. Or horrible. Or disturbing. Or obscene. Or all of the above.,"Chances are you'll either think ""Super"" is great or you'll think it's horrible, disturbing, and obscene. I think it's pretty great. And horrible. And disturbing. And perpetually on the brink of toppling from cutting, insightful commentary into vulgar exploitation."
4,A Gleefully Polarizing Movie,"From reading the previous reviews I see that this is one of those ""love it or hate it"" kind of movies. That certainly was true of my wife and I. I loved it, watched it twice in two days in fact. My wife, on the other hand, hates it. She barely got through it the first time we watched it. She kept saying, ""I really don't like this movie"" as we were watching it. I wish I would have watched it without her. So be forwarned. This is not for everyone. If you like dark-humor, low-budget movies with quirky, awkward, crazy characters and occasional bloody violence, then this may be for you. If you prefer mainstream, normal action, super-hero movies, stay away. Stay far away."
4,"LOW BUDGET ""KICK ASS"" IS SUPRISINGLY GOOD!","I wasn't expecting much from this ""Kick Ass"" knock off, but was pleasantly surprised watching this dark and sometimes brutal comedy. While the film has some funny moments, it is more disturbing funny than ""Ha-Ha"" funny. A very good film with some great performances and lots of over the top gore for fans of sick twisted fun( C....this one is for you!)."
1,I would give ZERO stars if that were an option.,"This movie is not a comedy. It stunk. Very dark, disturbing, depressing and bloody, very violent. Idiotic. Gee let me see... that's it."
1,How Bad Can a Movie Be,"Maybe one of worst movies I've seen this year. The proposed protaganist is is a psycopath. Not since ""Taxicab"" have I sean a character I'd less like to identify with. There is not a single character in this disacter that doesn't deserve to die, perferably before filming ever begins."
5,great film,"thought the idea of regular guy turned ""hero"" is not new, this film doesn't pull any punches and has a great script and the acting was also very good. i rented it when it first came out and then bought the blu ray on amazon."
3,Intresting,"Now super is okay i find it worth watching but also different. The main charecter has his wife taken by some thug so he seeks god. in my opinion this was nothing like ""kick ass"" also not as good as (kickass) the movie is pretty straight forward hes gonna save his wife so on but towards they end the movie takes an extremly dark turn when Libby played by (ellen page ) his sidekick have some sort of rape seen some what disturbing to me and really changed the way i thought of this movie but is still worth watching"
5,Absolutely a Must See,"First, this movie is not in the same vein as Kickass. Yes, it keeps an unmagical ""superhero"" within the restraints of the real world. But this is not the gimmicky trash you find in the other movies.Super is a dark comedy that shocks you in a way that makes you reflect about your expectations. It has excellent acting (no wonder when you see its lineup). And it is funny as hell. This is a smart, highly entertaining film that easily shares space with my favorites."
3,Look elsewhere for social commentary,"I think some people are reading into this movie a bit much. There is no overarching social commentary. Think of this as Watchmen Redux.The point of Watchmen is to take comic books out of their rarefied world and place them in a real-world context. If superheroes existed, what would their economic situation be? What would their politics be? *Super* strips out the politics and the social commentary but leaves the delusion and the violence.I tend to think that violence in movies is a bit of a cop-out. If you can't move your audience through emotional involvement with believable characters sketched in depth, you can always toss in some violence and get the audience to bray. Here, though, the violence is amped up to such a degree that it actually amounts to something novel and startling. Ellen Page's go-for-broke performance and the hilarious Christian superhero comic add to the movie's crazed exuberance."
3,Not like the preview---at all,"I normally do not review movies for the purposes of it is an art and everyone is entitled to their own opinion yada, yada.... That said, I rented this (yes, knowing it is an R-rated movie) out of the fact that I am a fan of the major actors and that the preview insinuated a dramatically comical and a bearable R-rated movie. That is why I'm writing. Please be warned that this movie VERY VULGAR both sexually and verbally and the violence is very graphic (and I mean VERY!). It is well acted by talented actors and I was absolutely pulled into the emotional turmoil (a sign of very good acting, IMO) of three very pathetic characters and a ""cute, but psycho"" young woman wonderfully played by Ellen Page. Just, be warned in case you are expecting the same type of feeling you got from watching ""Kick-Ass"" or ""Scott Pilgim..."" that any attempt at humor is exceptionally dark."
4,Kick Butt,The movies starts out slow but gains the credibility during the last 30 minutes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Kick Ass and Juno. The Juno girl is awesome
4,SUPER,"Entertaining, super dark comedy about a kind-of super hero. I was skeptical after the latest crop of superhero movies but this was a different fresh take. It was a little slow moving, but it progressed nicely and held my attention along the way. Super violent but in a funny way. (If that's possible)"
1,Not worth the money,"This movie is at the very best a ""B"" rated movie. The good reviews must be from people who would watch anything that has the lead wearing a mask. Save your money."
1,Pornography,"This film started bad and continued poorly until we shut it off. I realize it was R rated, but really should have been NC 17 with the sexual content that displayed in the opening minutes. I was disappointed considering the cast as several are favorites of mine. Bad language, very explicit sex scenes that merit something above an R rating and just bad acting and a bad story."
1,worst movie in ages,I have no idea who this was made for. I guess 19 and 20 year olds who can't go to bars and aren't really mature.
5,"Great movie, unique.","I personally thought this movie was awesome. I did not much about it, but it was pretty cheap and had some good reviews so i decided to try it. It was an excellent movie, a breath of fresh air. Yes it may not be spider man , green lantern or any other super hero movie but it is unique and awesome. Oh and no i don't watch every movie with superhero in it , i am a movie buff overall.I think the acting was great , the first time i ever seen the man everyone knows as ""Dwight Schrute"" act in a full movie. I recommend this movie to everybody. It is funny , well done and has a beautiful message in it.I must also mention , it may be a little violent for some peoples tastes ,not a family movie Hey at least check it out when it come on Netflix.While it may not be for everyone, it is quite original in my opinion. So go ahead , set some time aside , break out the popcorn and enjoy this movie."
3,Offbeat,"A bit violent for my taste but a twisted and touching movie. NOT a comedy so if that's what you're looking for, then keep searching."
2,Not worth your time...,"I rented this because it was on sale and the preview looked good. It is meant to be a funny and vulgar take on the current bands of amateur superheroes that are beginning to roam our cities today. Unfortunately it was not very good - it used way too unnecessary vulgar language, it wasn't very funny (although attempted to be several times), uncomfortable scenes (probably due to the fact it was trying to be crass and funny), was directly confrontational with Christians by mocking many christian practices (praying, faith, cross, Jesus, etc.),etc. etc.Don't waste your money or time. And to think they got Kevin Bacon and Liv Tyler to be in it and still couldn't get it to work - a total tragedy..."
2,ummm,i love rainn wilson on the office but i think that is where he needs to stay i didnt think this movie was good at all. i also saw the movie hesher the other day and i want those two hours of my life i wasted watch that movie as well.
2,Really Depressing,"I love the stars in this movie, especially Rainn Wilson, so it pains me to give this a bad review, but this was pretty trashy and depressing. I'm giving it 2 stars because it had some funny moments, but other than that, I was disappointed and would have given it 1. I can see why it has good ratings, but it wasn't for me."
5,On my favorite film list!,"Glad I got to see this in the theatre, now I can't wait to get the DVD. This will become a cult classic for sure once more people see it. I love a good vigilante justice film, and this is one of the best! You will cheer when justice is served, and wish the Crimson Bolt could take care of more of the bad guys in the world. Not just an action film, it has a huge heart too. James Gunn mixed horror and comedy perfectly in Slither, in Super he combines action, justice, fun and real life emotion. Great cast, Rainn & Ellen will surprise you, and the best opening sequence you'll watch over and over!"
3,It was ok,There are better movies just like this one. Defendor was great and almost the same story. This movie was worth watching once. Wish I had rented it first
3,Super Sad,"I'm giving it a low review because it was marketed poorly (not at all what you would expect from previews or even the cover). Assuming I watch it later, I probably could enjoy it a bit more but not much."
3,If you like this sort of thing.,"If you like dark comedies with a lot of bloody violence and the only way I can describe it ""effed up ish"" then you would probably enjoy this. I would have given it a two but I gave it a three because the acting was good. It just isn't the kind of movie I would enjoy."
1,Dissapointing,"I couldn't even get through this movie. I kept waiting for Frank's character to be charming, but it never came... maybe in the last few minutes when they try to neatly wrap up the movie and justify what you just spent the last hour and half watching. I love the actors in this movie, and the preview makes this movie out to be funny. I only found it to be depressing and strange. A serious let down, save you're money."
1,"A failed lesson in morality, justice and story telling.","Super starts out with some hope of a good story but quickly and violently loses its way by indulging in a strange form of Christianity, false dichotomies and insanity. It pretty much becomes an anti-story by completely disregarding character development and any need to have the audience sympathize or even understand the main characters. This so called ""dark comedy"" lacks much of the comedic element and becomes mired in a muddled mix of senseless mayhem thus producing a film which seemingly promotes the despicable notion of the ""end justifying the means""."
2,Dire,When I read the premise of this I thought it would be sort of like Falling Down where an average put upon Joe takes up the mantle of vigilante justice for all the cubicle types out there but... the film takes several dark turns without really building up to any relief point and meanders towards its cathartic finale. The characters are there. I get what they were going for with the protagonist. He desires to change the world but he's just one small man throwing a tantrum. It could've worked but the execution lets down the ideas. I liked Ellen Page's turn as his even more psychotic sidekick but she couldn't save this wearying flick from the soulsucking blackhole at its center. There are flashes of brilliance but I very much doubt you'll want to revisit the nihilistic world Director James Gunn has created.
1,corrupt files,"With my D200, I got about 10% corrupt files when the card was new. Now, after a few months, the card is unreadable at all. Repeated emails to Transcend have gone unanswered."
1,Doesn't work with all cameras,"This card is not compatible with my Canon Digital Rebel XTi. The camera reports that the card is bad, and photos get corrupted if you try to use it. I have done a bit-for-bit analysis of the card under Windows, Mac and Linux, and the card appears fine (using multiple card readers), so the problem has got to be the card's interaction with the camera. Others have reported that this card does not always work seamlessly with all models of cameras out there, and I guess the XTi is one of them. I have used other brands of 8GB cards with no issue in my XTi, such as PQI.Buyer beware, your mileage may vary."
5,Super Fast,Excellent product! Holds thousands of pictures and I can shoot all day without changing the card. If I needed another one I wouldn't look any further than the Transcend 120X.
2,no X's just raw speed,The whole notion of nnnX is misleading. This product did not live up to it's claim for me. 120x of what? I will no longer buy products with meaningless specs. How many MB/sec? That's the critical information which is masked by this ambiguous nnnX rating.
3,Adequate for the price,"This stand is sturdy except for the casters which are the cheapest I have ever seen. I'm being careful, but I do not expect them to last long. The packaging was minimal and resulted in two of the wooden pieces being scratched by other parts. It works okay in the back up roll I use it for, but I would not want it as a main piece of furniture."
4,Get's the job done.,"This desk is perfect for a college student. I have all my classes online this semester and I needed a desk that I could use in the living room but easily roll out of the way when needed. This desk is just that. I use it while sitting in an armchair that is a little high, so it is too tall for a couch but it works with any computer chair as well. The keyboard drawer is great for getting my laptop out of the way so that I can work on the top of the desk and the shelf on the bottom has enough room for my printer and my textbooks. The assembly is pretty easy, there are times when the screws need to be pushed in more than screwed in but so far the structure is stable and can handle just about anything. The front locking wheels are a bonus as well. I think this is a great buy for any college student that needs a 'quick fix.'"
4,small computer cart,"This computer cart is a bargain for the price. It works well with my 17 inch iMac as it is strong enough to support the weight. My only complaint is in the castors. I plan to purchase better quality ones, so that it moves more smoothly."
1,I should write a book...,"This book is definitely not for the intermediate looking to tweak their skills with. The pictures are poorly done and the writing is totally unstructured. As I recall, this book was suppose to be for the advanced level and it's more like grade school level. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,I'm glad that I bought this book.,"After reading the negative reviews of Mr. Mortier's books, I hesitated to buy any of them but am glad that I went ahead and did so. I now own all of his Bryce books, as well as Real World Bryce 4, by Susan Kitchens. Mr. Mortier's artistic style is very different from mine, but his books have provided a springboard for some of my own creative ideas ...They have also shown me some techniques that I might not have figured out on my own. As a self-taught artist, if I get even a couple of new ideas from a book, I consider that book worth the price. I am grateful to Mr. Mortier for clarifying some key concepts and reinforcing my enthusiasm for Bryce."
2,Weird writing style akin to a tv infomercial,"I picked up this book because the topics interested me -- health, nutrition, meditation, etc. All in all, however, it proved a dissatisfying read, and the few suggestions I tried (a few of the nutritional supplement recommendations) had unpleasant effects. The tone of the writing reminded me of a tv informercial. It mixes an odd zealotry for the author's lifestyle recommendation with the promotion of specific products, which made me wonder if she has some interest in seeing these products sold. Really, a book to avoid."
1,VERY Difficult to get good results,"Cleans OK, but leaves a white residue unless you wipe vigorously as the product dries. You will get a ""work out"" getting good results. It can only be applied to a small area at a time. I had the best results applying with one cloth and polishing with another clean, dry cloth. Sometimes you have to apply several times before getting a clean finish. My advice is to stay away from this cleaner. There are many better performing earth friendly products available."
2,great for domestic adoptions,"Don't waste your time if international adoption is your focus. Most info is geared to domestic adoption, and international adoption is second-hand at best (and poor advice at worst)."
2,Nothing new for me,"This book on adoption did not provide me with things I didn't already know. If you have been researching adoption on your own, attending meetings and are looking for something to go beyond this is not the book. If you are starting from scratch, it may help. The problem with information on International adoption is that the rules change all the time so anything you read in a book, follow up with government websites to make sure it is accurate."
2,Sacred Rings,"I did not care for this game. It kept going into these dark, depressing rooms. Thanks for sending it so fast."
4,Really liked this game.,"I really enjoyed this game, there were lots of different types of worlds to go to and fun challenges good storyline."
3,Who is this impostor?,"Where is the real Umang? Pleasant chap, enthusiastic attitude, friendly. Who is this scowling, sarcastic stuffed shirt? He looks, sounds, and acts nothing like Umang. Disappointing and bewildering to those of us who ran straight from Fate of Ages to this sequel, eager to once again pick up the quest and see where our 'hero' landed.The graphics are improved--they were excellent to begin with--and the puzzles challenging. Unfortunately, we left off at the demo, the sinister impostor having annoyed us enough to find ourselves disobliged to continue.If change of character doesn't bother you at all, this is a worthy game; enjoy."
2,Do not recommend,I was disappointed with this game. The puzzles at times are illogical and not much fun to figure out. If I hadn't been able to go online to get clues (and sometimes answers) then I'd give it one star. The scenery in the game is very nice.
3,good,"The game is good, but very dark in places and 'hot spots' are hard to find in those areas. The story line is not as good as Aura, but does continue the line."
3,Starts off great.............................,"Me and my girlfriend liked Aura and couldn't wait to play Sacred. The game starts off great but after the 4 worlds with the tram part(very Rivenish), it goes down hill.The castle part is disappointing and disjointed. There's not much to explore....wish they did more here............"
5,Sacred Rings,I am not much of a gamer but this game has held my attention and is very enjoyable with many challenges to keep me interested.
5,Accessorize Steelers Style!,"These well made quality items will complement your Steelers-wear beautifully, at a very wallet friendly price. I've received many positive remarks about them. They're durable and present a striking visual. I represent my team year round with the shirts, the earrings...this was a nice little addition to my ""look"". Watches and bracelets are alright, but I was always afraid of damaging them because of the work I do. These wristbands are snug, provide wrist support, are washable....they're different, cool as hell in appearance and practical. WIN! I wear them daily, and they still look brand new. A well constructed item. An affordable & trendy way to represent. GO STEELERS!!!! From a very satisfied (and proud) Steelers fan."
3,the real Dr. Stragelove,"I will be brief as others have written very good reviews. The authors start off well connecting with those interested in Edward Teller or the ""Atomic Era coming of Age"". The book does justice and provides insight until the later third, begining with the Oppenheimer security issues. From there it declines into an obsession with political correctness....conservatives are right-wing and liberals have no slur attached to them. The book ends with less and less of Teller as the object but more as a useful tool for the authors spin on history."
5,No problem with RAZR,"Light weight, great range (much better than Moto HS820 I had previously), I can roam around my living room area with phone on charger and no statics.Very easy to pair up with RAZR, sometimes I wish the volumn can be louder (Noisy enviroment) but for the most part it is loud and clear. Great battery life too and uses the same USB charger as the RAZR and matches my RAZR handset."
2,Can't handle road noise,"Really liked the feel and look, could hear callers ok but a bit low volume.The killer was a drive down the freeway. The callers couldn't hear me very well. My voice was very distorted. Could hear me fine if there was no road noise."
2,it's all looks.,"I have limited experince with Bluetooth cell phones & headsets. From what I've gathered, headsets will work differently with different phones. I own a Motorola E815, and picked up this headset based off the looks, and a few quicky things I've read about it. My biggest problem was the volume, even at the max setting it didn't seem that loud. Is my phone messed up? did I get a bad headset? is this headset just not good with an E815? I don't know, but at full volume it was nowhere near the earpiece volume on my phone, I'd say 60% tops. I'm not hard of hearing, but I could use more volume then this headset could produce. Also, the 2nd person who talked to me while i was using it said they could hear themselves echoing very badly. Which I've read is a fairly common BT headset issue. The volume was the deal breaker for me, I promptly returned it, and am doing more research before I decide what to replace it with."
3,Ok,Gets the job done but volume is not that great. Range is also limited compared to some other headsets.
2,Looks good works bad,Looks cool but has very poor volume and everyone I called complained of a terrible echo when they spoke. I ended up buying a differnt bluetooth and just wrote this off as a lesson learned. I definitely would not reccomend this product.
2,Motorola Bluetooth Blue Tooth H3 where is promised,"Bought new from Best Buy f or $79 I think. Price range, OK. Slim, yes. Sound quality could be better when it gets to MOTOROLA. I fully charged it for at least 24 hours first time before the 1st use. In a second I was connected to my RAZR v3, then to PALM 650 and finally, Audiowox. Guys, very same results with each phone. Few of my callers on other end mentioned some static. I could not walk away far even at promised distance. The fully charged chip DOES NOT give you promised talk time and needs recharging. Pain. Gave it away as a present."
5,DISCOVER this awesome CD!,"This soundtrack album to the Ashlee Simpson / Steven Strait movie is a real surprising treat.The impressive songs featured in the movie are all on this collection. It's got 7 nice songs from Steven Strait and is a perfect companion piece to the movie...once you see the movie, you have to pick up the album."
3,Should be discovered by Everyone!!,"The movie was okay. Cute, nothing too special. But the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! If you saw the movie, even if you didn't, you NEED this soundtrack!!"
2,"Purching this ""smart"" but in a stupid way?","There are a few fun songs here. However, only one song is a stand out (smart in a stupid way). Which is pretty and fairly well done. I personally think the lyrics could use some rewriting and this could get close to being a great song. I would suggest the rewrite be done by a male songwriter older than 35 and maybe have had some kind of relationship with a beautiful Japanese lady who's possibily aspiring to be a 5/0 tennis player. The opening lyrics might be ""She had eyes almond shaped diamonds"". You have to wonder after watching the movie if Ashlee could ever have a lover that she would ever betray. As for the rest of the songs they're fine for playing in a party atmosphere where the coversation is preeminent."
1,I LOVE THE MOVIE BUT THE SOUNDTRACK SUCKS WITHOUT ASHLEE!!!!!!!!!,"Undiscovered soundtrack is pointless and the only reason why i say that is because Ashlee is not on it..... I love the movie and the only way to really check out this music is to buy the movie,because Jen Crowe can not sing whatsover..... So if you want to waste your money then buy this soundtrack,but if you want to save your money then buy the movie and check out my girl Ashlee really sing!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Just OK,"The more talented members of this band went on to bigger and better things. The songs are pretty good, and the guitar/vocals/production all great. What really lets this band down is the terrible rhythm section. I'm not expecting George Hurley or anything, but when the drummer can't even keep time, you've got problems. You'll be just getting into a song and suddenly it speeds up/slows down/stumbles due to appalling drumming. Shame, as I really wanted to like it. Eventually cut my losses and put it on ebay."
1,pretty but not very functional,This crib set is pretty however the blanket is rather small and uncomfortable for baby's new skin. Also diaper holder is for show it ripped after 4 uses not even full. very dissappointed bad value for the money.
2,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this item. I bought it for my granddaughter and initially loved the set. It was beautiful but upon actual use of it in the crib, it began to tear at the seams and fray all over. It is unsafe to even have it in the crib. It is definitely pretty but not worth it if you can't use it."
1,The REAL Story....You got to be kidding me!,"I found a copy in a retail bargain bin and bought it out of curiosity. If you can find a copy for $5 or less, it's worth the price for sheer comedy relief. If the teams portrayed in this program actually exist, I'm amazed there aren't more fatalities during real tactical operations. The narrator continued to brag about how SWAT teams are well trained while you watch the virtual circus of ineptitude on the screen. For the sake of all that's holy, I hope this DVD remains MIA and out of stock."
5,This real actioner surpasses the fictionalized film versions,"After you've seen the myriad of Hollywood films centered around ""S.W.A.T."" teams, you owe it to yourself to see the real thing. ""S.W.A.T. THE REAL STORY"" features footage from real crime and action scenes across the country, where actual procedures are utilized in apprehending criminals and diffusing dangerous situations. The footage is phenomenal, but much of it is definitely ""too hot for T.V."" Check it out!!!"
3,Not for iPad/kindle,"The ""beautiful color photographs"" are in b&w in the iPad version- I had expected color. I can only imagine how bad this would look on a kindle."
2,"Good for Fans, Bad for Towel","Well they shipped it here speedy, so thats good. However, its not exactly bath towle material. Its like drying off with a paper towel. Its VERY thin. But good for the fans, maybe as something you just hang in your bathroom with your other Packer decor?"
2,"This DVD was okay, but not great.","Service was good, but the movie was only fair. I was expecting a better movie. La La La La La"
1,"Too much twang, not enough talent.","This performer is an unfortunate amalgum of self-importance and no musical ability. What is interesting is this performer claims to have written these songs himself and yet, they remind this reviewer of other songwriters' imagery. Maybe this performer believes that stealing other writer's ideas is okay, but it is not. Unfortunately, this performer can't even compensate with an acceptable vocal instrument. This album is like listening to a cat in heat get its tale cut off..or maybe a goat with indigestion. I suggest this performer realize that he may enjoy singing, but he should not claim to have any musical or poetic abilities."
5,Another work of genius from the mind of Mr. Larson.,"This is a typically hilarious and strange offering of comics from Gary Larson and features eight full-color spoofs of famous artwork, including ""The Scream"" and ""The Persistence of Time"" involving those strange little animals known as ""wiener dogs."" These comics can appeal to anyone and are a fine addition to anyone's collection. Very highly recommended for anyone that loves to laugh!P.S. It's spelled ""dachshund,"" not ""dochson"" as a previous review puts it, but nobody says that anymore anyway. At least that's what Gary Larson says."
3,Wiener's? Where?,"Gary Larson's The Far Side was one of the best ever series of cartoons. This book however is mislabeled. There is verylittle about ""Wiener Dogs"" in this collection."
2,Would like more art,"This is pretty much a typical Far Side comic book, just happens to have about a dozen famour art spoofs in the center that use a wiener dog theme. From some of the other reviews I expected more of this art and less comics. Bought it for a daucshund lover thinking she would love it. Disappointed to see that for the most part it's just a comic book."
3,A Far side book with very little weiner dog art,It is a bunch of Far Side so I gave it 3 stars because I'll keep it BUT....BUT I thought it would be a lot of weiner dog comics which it is NOT! There are some but the title is misleading and a let down from what I expected. I gave it as a gift and had to warn them before they opened it that the package is somewhat false advertising so don't get their hopes too high.
4,an older relaxed jelly roll.,"recorded in 1938, an older jelly roll morton sings and plays solo piano on a variety of blues, rags, and folk tunes that harken back to the early days of the 20th century. listening to these relaxed, wonderful performances is like evesdropping in on somebody playing at a beer joint back in the days when ragtime and the blues were forces in popular music. mr morton's voice is easy and pleasing, and his piano playing a joy. he may have been up in years when he recorded this stuff but his enthusiasm for music still comes through like that of a young man. i can almost taste the cheap beer and hear the clacking of pool balls as i listen to this stuff. music to transport you into america's past. a real treat."
3,Gift with purchase Big and Attractive,Mine arrived scratched. The dark area seems to be painted on over steel and I think there are brush marks visible. I guess this is a decorative piece hence the markup. Amazon sent me a replacement which I am keeping although it also is scratched. I counted three scratches on each collander and chose the one where the location of the scratches were less irritating. This is a very big colander. I imagine that this is desired by people with top notch kitchens. It hasn't grown on me yet.
4,The Nurnberg Funnel and Real People,"I first read this text in relation to problem-based learning. It was referenced as an eclectic way of building documentation. I found the book very interesting and had some follow-on discussion with the author. The point is that documentation should be oriented toward how the users work, not how the system works. Carroll presents sound research to back up his point of view and the text illustrates his points. Anyone who is charged with writing documentation should read this book --- it will change your view point and your readers will love you for it."
3,They Imprisoned the Wrong One,"After reading this book, my first response was that the wrong person was prosecuted for this crime. Susan's mother knew she was being molested by her stepfather and continued living with this man. Her daughter threatened suicide and even tried, yet she still ignored her, not wanting the stigma of mental illness hanging over her family. I am not defending Susan's actions at all, but this woman was by no means a mother or role model to her. The only good thing I can say about Linda Russell is she must have a lot of nerve to display her negligence to the world or else she must have needed the money badly.Despite my criticisms of the author's character, I believe this book should be read by troubled teens and their mothers."
3,A shameful attempt to shift the blame.,"For Linda Russell to throw darts, the way she does in this account, to David Smith, who after his two dead babies is the one and only victim of her murderous daughter, is shameful; and really not worthy of the person she pretends to be: a Christian. Hypocrisy and a desire for revenge is what comes through the pages of this pathetic story. Mrs. Russell would do well in looking at herself in the mirror, and she should ask herself some questions. She does not need to tell us the answers. We already know them. Susan Smith is a murderess, and she should have been given the death penalty. Michael and Alex didn't get justice. Sleep with the angels babies. And Union is a County of cowards."
1,Ridiculous!!!,"As a grandmother I feel this woman's pain, but she blames everyone except the one who let these children die a slow and frightening death!!! This book makes me furious!!! It's fine to love your daughter, but to consistently excuse her actions and blame others for her behavior is maddening!!! Susan Smith KILLED her babies!!! This lady needs to WAKE UP!!! I don't care what her husband did to her!!!"
4,Blame,"Linda spends a lot of the book blaming David (Susan's husband) for his actions. Undoubtably he added to the crime, as did his girlfriend Tiffany.After Susan's C-section she came home from the hospital to a toddler and newborn.Tiffany went nuts because David was living there and came by at all hours blowing her car horn. David left Susan for Tiffany after buying a house with Susan and promising her a commitment to her and their two kids.. Susan's biological father commited suicide, and had threatened to take his kids with him. Susan's stepfather, sexually abused her for years. Her mother knew about this and about Susan's previous suicide attempts.She chose to stay with her husband after the abuse. There is plenty of blame to go around in this tragedy. I feel if just all these people + all their problems hadn't been in Susan's life, it just might have not ended this way."
1,Better Save This One For The Tabloids,"Although the writing in this book was far superior than the one David Smith had written about Susan, the theme was essentially the same--let's see who we can blame other than ourselves for Susan and her problems. This story would fare best in the tabloid magazines, along with the other stories that have been written. Bottom line is that Susan murdered her two beautiful and innocent children, and nothing can ever be said, written, or done to change that. Rest in Peace, Sweet Angels."
4,A good book about a tragic situation,"This is a very good book. My heart breaks for everyone involved in this tragic, heart-breaking situation, and I can only pray for Susan and her family. Linda did a very good job of exposing things that were hard to think about, much-less to express to the world."
2,"Linda Russell, you're to blame.......","In this book Linda Russell blames everyone but herself for what happened to Susan. After Susan first attempted suicide, Linda Russell should have been a parent and saw that Susan received the help she needed for her depression. She allowed Susan to go through her teens without the psychiatric help that Susan so desperately needed and what's worse she let that child molestor husband of hers Bev Russell back into the home so that he could molest Susan several more times. What??? Are you kidding me? Susan was sleeping with a married man when she was 17 and her Mother knew about it? Linda Russell was clearly an absentee parent and is as much to blame for Susan's behavior as David, Tom Findlay or Bev Russell are. She used this book to point fingers at everyone other than herself. As Susan's Mother Linda Russell was responsible for protecting Susan but she repeadetly allowed her to remain in harm's way."
1,Worst book ever,This poor woman is delusional. After reading the book it's no wonder Susan Smith turned out the way she did. Her mother is a self centered narcissistic nut job. Rather than worry about her daughter when she exhibited signs of deteriorating mental health she worried about what her friends and neighbors might think about her. Unreal. Susan didn't stand a chance with a mother like her as a role model. Don't bother with this book. It will only make you angry and wonder why the mother isn't serving time for the damage she did to her daughter.
4,One side of a tragedy...,"Clearly the side of the convicted, but a good book if this is kept in mind. Simple and easy to read. I liked the quotes."
4,Eclectic Entertainment,"Tired of the same old, same old? Looking for something new in the way of electronic entertainment? Well, look no further than ""Writers' Block Party."" It's an eclectic mix of humor, song and spoken word. From the haunting lyrics of Jonny Polonsky to the wit of Billy Collins and Patricia Marx, you'll want to ""read"" this audio magazine again and again."
3,"Not a quick set up or clean up, but provides good shade in use","Ordered this for a trip to the Bahamas. Surprisingly light, but packing it back up was difficult was we were afraid to rip the think plastic sack. Directions were easy to follow and the inside pockets are good for keeping ipods and cameras off the sand. 1 of my stakes kept flying free when the wind blew the tent, and when I forcefully shoved it back in the ground, it bent. Putting lots of heavy things inside (like sunchairs, books, and people) and opening the windows helps keep it from blowing away. Shades 2 people on low loungechairs or 3 people sitting on the ground. Messy cleanup when there's sand everywhere and wind whipping the parts around. If you only plan to spend less than 2 hrs in the sun, probably not worth the time setting up and breaking down."
1,Nice concept poor implementation,"I have an infant so sun shade does sound like a good idea. Got this from amazon. It looks nice and the price is right.First time to the beach, took two of us 10 minutes and couldn't set it up properly. You have to assemble little sticks into one long pole and two short pole and thread them into the tent. In our case, the long pole was too long and couldn't fit.I was ready to return it and then tried again at home. Found the problem. There was an extra stick on the long pole assembly. After removing it it worked perfectly.Next time to the beach, during the setup, one little stick is snapped in half during assembly. So the total times we enjoyed this little tent: 0.Pro' it looks nice when it's set up properly. We were at the cape, I saw three nice sun shade, two of them is this model.Con: Setup took a long time. Beach umbrella is much easier. Not sturdy enough."
1,More frustration than it's worth!,"The only advantage to this tent is that I bought it for much much cheaper than any of the competing tents. This shelter turned out to be way more frustrating than it was worth. Right out of the box, one of the pieces broke off. It is clearly cheaply made. Once I got it up, I thought it would work, but every few minutes it would blow completely on top of me. I tried many different orientations trying to get it away from the wind but nothing worked and it was only a mildy windy day for the beach. Finally I just gave up and packed up. If you are interested in beach shade, I would save my money and upgrade!"
4,Love it!,"I absolutely love this cabana! It is a bit difficult to setup on a windy day, but once it's up it's great! Provided shelter for my daughter and also fit 2 adults and 2 kids without a problem.Definitely recommend to those who don't want to spend too much time in the sun!"
1,Not Great,I bought this for our baby to take to the beach thinking it would be light weight to carry back and forth to the hotel. We used it once. My husband and I were so upset after getting it up with the breeze off the ocean we didn't think it could get worse but IT DID. When we went to take it down it was blowing every which way and blowing sand everywhere. Not a good experience. Waste of $35.00..
4,Discover John Carbon's Music,"If you haven't heard Carbon's music yet, this is a great introduction to his work, since it containis 3 major orchestral and one chamber work. Carbon's music is diverse and wonderfully narative, and usually lyrical, although he exhibits the capacity for grit when needed. I highly recommend this CD for his orchestrational ability and mastery of the concerto idiom. Just plain fun to listen to."
3,Dumb but endearing,"This is one of the dumbest made for TV movies I've ever seen. It's like a bad episode of Dark Shadows -- yet it's oddly entertaining too. Kate Jackson and Robert Wagner have to be two of the best looking people ever on TV, and Kate especially looks great in those mid-1970s clothing styles. Though the plot is really hokey, and the dialog is really corny, the thing seems to have been entirely filmed at somebody's palatial Spanish style estate, and it has a lot of old Hollywood atmosphere, enhanced by cameos from Dorothy Lamour, John Carradine (a hoot!) and Joan Blondell. I watched it with great enjoyment and would recommend it just for fun and nostalgia."
3,Decent movie with lots of talk about sex,"A decent movie, though it fails to keep your attention fully throughout the whole show.But if you want to see a movie covering mostly a slumber party full of beautiful women talking about sex (plus a little nudity), this might be it. (The title is not to be taken literally, of course.)By the way, the song that's playing during the fantasy scene with Olivia d'Abo and Lora Zane at around 45 minutes is ""Picture Of An Angel"", by Candy Says. More info here: [...]"
4,I liked it. Great movie!,"This is a movie about friends hanging out, drinking coctails, talking about their past, and exploring and discussing sexual fantasies. It kind of gives you a glimpse on how women interact when just women mingle. I liked the house a lot. Although the title of the movie is a bit of a misnomer it has a decent ensemble as a cast. Olivia D'Abo and Kim Cantrell are in it who are very attractive. But my favorite actress and favorite part is when silly adorable Cynthia Stevenson walks around drunk in her bra and panties acting silly. And her fantasy as her in a barbie doll costume is priceless. Cynthia Stevenson is not only adorable but has a great body, and she kisses Olivia d'abo so that makes the movie worthwhile. LOL."
1,Many cracks,"DVD had many cracks on the recorded surface and could not be played, so I had to polish! It was the worst!The seller must have not checked the item before shipping.I won't buy again from this seller."
3,strange title of a movie,"this one has a strange title and I thought at first it was a porno or something but then I saw Glenn Quinn in the mix and I was like, cool, Glenn Quinn sparked some spazazz in this one. and its a comedy. the leading ladies are excellent as always."
3,It's okay,"As one person put on here too - - it's okay. It's a ""chick flick"" about bonding, problems, etc. The film showcases known actresses."
3,Live Nude Girls [VHS] (90'S MOVIE),"LOL! I noticed alot of men bought this movie thinking it was probably somewhat of a ""skin flick"" which is actually pretty amusing. In hollywood ""sex sells"", so just because a movie has a title that is sexy or imply's nudity or sex doesn't necessarily mean the entire movie is about that.Anyway, This movie is a CHIC FLICK. I own a copy of this movie and it is hilarious!It's about a group of ladies who grow up together (kind of similar to Sex In The City that way) and reminisce about the past and compare it with where they are in the present.Some very bizarre scenes. And the lounge music really adds the cherry on top in the sex scene."
2,Could have been better...,Was very disappointed in the plot and the actresses. The portrayals were unbelievable and it had no sense of direction.
4,Saucy and Feel-Good,"The real razzle-dazzle is in the dialogue. Subtle, sassy, wonderful chemistry between the women. Pay attention to catch all those inside-jokes and jibes. This isn't a tear-jerker or a white-knuckler, but the sparkling dialogue and endearing characters make this a film to collect. That is, if you like a good chick-flick considering a panoply of sexual topics! Thumbs up to all the fantasy scenes, especially the one between zane and d'abo. Effervescent and sexy."
2,I dont like it,"it may looks cute and that's main reason for me to bought it but wearing it wasn't comfortable of course due to tight in front of shoe and there were so much pain in my fingers, I really wished to throw it away in that day, it deserve 2 stars for nice design and light weight."
5,Very nice,"Very nice book, either if you are a cooking student or home cook but curious on how things work!I'f studied from it and it's very good, very complete!Hey its a thick book on the subject without pictures, its full of info!"
5,Why Chemistry is vital for a cook,"The book is wonderful. If you love to cook and wonder why and how foods taste wonderful--or horrible--this the book for you. It explains which methods work and which don't and why they do. Worth every penny. Harold McGee is a good writer which makes the book a pleasant, worthwhile read."
1,It didn't fit my requirements,I wanted a recipe book and this one is theory book. It'd be great to include a better description of the book in order to don't have mistakes like me.
5,A Food Trivia Must-Read!,"As the culinary historian and author of www.CookingUpHistory.com I wouldn't be without this book. It is an industry bible for food lore and trivia, from the basic to the bizarre, every crumb of food knowledge you could ever hunger for is within the covers of this book. Buy it, keep it and don't loan it out, 'cause if you do, say ""Bye Bye."" IT IS THAT GOOD!"
1,HORRIBLE KINDLE VERSION,Please save yourself the trouble and the money!! Do not purchase the kindle version. The content has not been formatted for kindle reading. All the tables and charts are impossible to read and you have to scroll horizontally & vertically. I wish I could return the kindle version and get the hardcopy. Unfortunately there's no way to contact Amazon to make the exchange.
5,Great Book!,"This book is great for students and teachers that want to know the scientific information about cooking and baking. For example it explains the chemical changes in leavening, emulsions, and so much more. It talks about the nature of plants, dairy, all of the cookingmethods. Oh I dont think the author missed a single detail in this hows, whys, and whos of cooking. I highly recommended it to keep in your house."
3,"Great Book, deficient Kindle rendition","Great Book, deficient Kindle rendition[[ASIN:B000PAAH1W On Food and Cooking].The kindle edition is more expensive and has important errors. It inserts headers in the text body. The references are to page numbers in the printed edition. In general it makes poor use of the Kindle platform.The Book is Great! It answers many if not all questions an amateur cook may have about the physics and chemistry of cooking."
4,"Puts ""Keys to Good Cooking"" To Shame","This book redeems everything bad I had to say about McGee's ""Keys To Good Cooking.""It's informative and goes in depth into the technical details of food lore."
5,Amazing,"This book has it all. If you are not satisfied with ""just do it. It will work"" this book is for you. scientific explanations of how food works. Love this book."
5,Amazing!,"This book is simply amazing. It has to be the most useful utensil in any kitchen. As a scientist, I love the in-depth treatment that is given to almost every aspect of almost every edible thing on earth. It may not be the most appropriate book to everyone. You must be willing to dedicate a lot of effort to soak in all the knowledge available in it."
5,on food and cooking,"I have read the first eddition, and when I heard they put out a 2nd I had to see what changed. I'm only 50 pages in to it but it is just as good as the first"
3,Not for the dabbler,"This is an exhaustive, technical dense treatise on the chemistry and physics of cooking. It is pretty readable and quite well suited for an academic approach. I bought it thinking it to be something closer to a lengthy, general purpose magazine article on how food changes in preparation and found myself with more than I'd bargained for. It is a fine representation of what it is, but too specific and lengthy for a casual reader such as myself. For the serious chef or chemistry student, tho, it cannot be faulted."
5,And One More Reason ...,"I bought this book (which I have loved in both editions) for my 14-year-old science nerd nephew. Sure enough, now he's a foodie, too!"
2,"Kindle Edition Reviewed/Critiqued, Not Electronically Indexed for Convenience, but Great book to read like a novel","THIS REVIEW DOES NOT APPLY TO THE PAPER EDITION, BUT ONLY TO THE POOR FORMATTING FOR KINDLE: I was highly disappointed in this Kindle edition,and returned it; this was not because this is a poor book, but because it is not tabbed as so many others are (such as Cook's Illustrated, the Zondervan NIV bible, etc.) Without tabbing, either you read it thru like a novel, page to page, OR, you look up, for ex., ""eggs"", and get how ever many dozen or hundred entries there are. It was not helpful to use. Hardback better, unless book chapters tabbed in future."
5,Best Armchair Cookbook!,"There are a bunch of very detailed reviews on this book, so I just want to add:On Food and Cooking covers the same ground as Cookwise and Alton Brown's I'm Just Here for the Food books. I was trying to decide which to order and eventually settled on this book after looking through all three. The other books are great, but don't cover as much breadth or detail. Alton Brown's books are more like cliffs notes to this book. I was originally considering buying all four books, but now realize On Food and Cooking is the only one I need or want. It can be textbookish, but is still engrossing and enjoyable. Also, the other books seem to contain more errors.(...)"
5,a treasure !,"Wandering through the wealth of descriptions in ""On Food and Cooking"" is a real treat! Great for those ""why does it work this way?"" questions that come up all the time when cooking."
2,Not what I expected,"I was routed to this book from recommendations on reviews for ""Cooking for Geeks"". Turns out this is not quite the same style of reading.To be fair, I'm only on the first part of the book, but it wasn't good enough for me to continue.Honestly, I don't give a darn about different types of bovines and the fat content of their milk or countries of origin and such. There is no practical application to cooking in that, which is what I thought I was getting.Lot of history, not a lot of practical cooking knowledge."
5,The best companion for the serious cook,"Sometimes all you want is a recipe. Sometimes you want more. When what you are looking for is information on the fundamental properties of a specific kind of food and the dos and don'ts of its cooking, I believe this book is hard to beat. In this volume, I've found answers to questions like:- Why is it often said that you cook squid for 5 minutes or onehour?- What is creme fraiche? What is clotted cream?- Why do green vegetables look drab after cooking?- ... and many more.This is not a cookbook in the sense that it has no recipes, but it's one of the best books you can find to understand what is happening to the food you deal with. At times, the chemistry in the discussion goes way over my head, but even then I can still manage to learn something that allows me to improve my cooking."
4,Christian Contemporary Music CD,Wonderful selections with upbeat music. Well known artists and easy to sing to as well as meditate on the message. Strongly suggest it for your christian music collection.
5,Great buy!,Cardiovascular care made incredibly easy is a great buy. It definitely helps the novice nurse gain insight and give helpful hints to the longtime nurse needing a refresher.
5,BEST CD ALL YEAR,"I just got done listening to the cd, and i have to agree that it is the best rock n roll album that came out all year. Forget about the wannabe rock bands like limp bizkit. STP knows how to rock, if you think that down is there only good song you are mistaken. Sour girl, atlanta are all good songs. So if you have not bought this cd, go out and buy it now!."
5,STP is back!!! This album is extremly creative!!,The album is great.. just when i thought i was going to get used to music that never changes in sound STP saved me once agin! I just wish that Wieland could get himself clean. Mabey us fans could have a uncorupted release and tour!
4,"A more old school STP the ""tiny music"" (which really sucked)",This CD is awsome. It seemed STP was going downhill after Tiny Music but they are back again kickin' it like old times. Its no Purple but its still a CD you need to buy.
4,An excellent collage of STP to date,"I purchased this album today and I've given it five good listens so I feel competent to speak briefly about it.First of all, this is a really good album! I've enjoyed following STP through their different phases and this is no different. However, it is a bit different. No. 4 takes the best of what STP was doing on their first 3 albums and forges them into 11 fully developed and strong sounding tracks.""Down"", ""Church On Tuesday"", ""Glide"" and ""Atlanta"" are the highlights of this album, for me at least.If you've enjoyed anything from STP weather it be their early heavier work or their lounge-ish, poppy Tiny Music, you'll find something on this album.Can't wait for Scott to get out of rehab to seem them live again! :)"
1,STP SELL'S OUT Fans,"When I heard the single ""Down"" i thought STP was moving back to it's older, and much better, material. But they sold out on the rest of the songs I was very dissapointed in even buying the album. If you want to here true STP listen to their older music"
1,The Clone Temple Pilots,"Will somebody please tell Scott Weiland that he is not Eddie Vedder? Nor will he ever be. Thank you.Now, with that said, I must say that the music on the Clone Temple Pilot's ""No. 4"" record is as generic as the record's title - perhaps even more so. ""Down"" sounds like a re-treaded version of their first tired album from 1992, back when the Clone Temple Pilots were truly trying to jock Pearl Jam.By the way, have you guys heard Pearl Jam's new record? It's totally cool, totally Seattle-soundin'!!!Stay away from this record, it will only bore you. On the last track, Weiland tries to be Jim Morrisson (I know, I can't stop laughing about it either), and the results are disastrous. He sounds like a tired cocktail lounge singer in Vegas who's had one too many cocktails...HOPE THIS HELPS..."
2,This is what happens when bands follow trend in music,"This CD is pretty much garbage. It is heavy like their first release, but it is missing any kind of hook or catchy lyrics. I don't recomend this to anyone."
4,Hard Rock and Soft Frailness makes for an outstanding CD,"Stone Temple Pilots takes us back to their first release, hard rocking / metal with just a touch of alternative vocals. This entire CD spells out hard hits, from Down to Atlanta! Down is a banging heavy guitar track. Heaven and Hot Rods is vintage STP, with a solid drum / guitar combination with singer Scotts beauty of his voice. Sour Girl is a standout song on this CD, it is a very soft song built around the lyrics and it tells a story of love and leaving. Church on Tuesday is a solid track focusing around Scotts vocals and lyrics accompanied with a big guitar. No Way Out is always a fun song, its a song you sing when you have someone that you do not like and they have trapped themselves. Sex and Violence is another fast paced alternative rock marvel, with brief pauses between guitar riffs to catch your breath. I Got You, has a spicy country twang to it and it is totally how you feel when you have someone during a tough time. Good Album."
3,STP- Can't get into this one,"STP is a band I've followed ever since I first heard ""Plush"" onthe radio as a freshman in highschool. I alwyas look forward to their releases, and, when I heard they released No. 4, I went out and bought it immediately.I like a few of the songs on the CD, but musical complexity, in my opinion, is largely absent from this album. What I enjoy about STP is their good guitar parts and dynamic sound....this album just kinda seemed like a punch in the stomach. ""Down"" just didn't captivate me like ""Big Bang Baby,"" ""Plush,"" or ""7 Caged Tigers"" did.This album is heavier and less musical than Core. Anyways, I guess most people do like this album, but I have to cast my dissenting vote. You're better off buying STP's other albums."
4,I was too quick to judge...,"At first I hated it. I thought, ""what a s*** album! Sour Girl and Down are the only good songs!"" Was I wrong. While listening to the radio, I heard ""Sex Type Thing"" and considering No. 4 is the only STP album I own, I went back to it for a second listen. I'm glad I did. I also went back to listen to all their albums, and this is their best, definitely (followed by Core, Purple, and Tiny Music). It rocks so hard on some songs, which is really cool (down, heaven and hot rods, No Way Out) and then smooths out to a guitar driven mellow ones (Sour Girl, Atlanta). However, not all is good: Pruno and Church on Tuesday are probably the worst songs on here, and after a while you may find youself listening to only the rock songs, or the mellow, whatever fits you. Truly STP's best work, and one of the most solid, and great rock albums ever."
3,Not bad,"Being a huge fan of the band, I preordered this CD from Amazon.com and anxiously awaited it for the next week. There are some very good songs here, particularly Sex and Violence, but some of them seem kind of bland, like Church on Tuesday, and MC5 is horrible. But I think anyone who is a fan of the band will like this one overall. Hopefully it won't take as long as last time for the next one."
5,STP IS ALWAYS A GOOD CHOICE,I REALLY THINK ANYTHING STP DOES TOGETHER ALWAYS SOUNDS GOOD. THIS CD IS GOOD IN SO MANY WAYS THAT SOME BANDS SEEM TO FORGET. WHICH IS REINVENT YOURSELF.
3,"A good effort, but next time, less thunder, more rain.","I hadn't heard much STP at all before this album, so I am basing my review solely on the sound and emotion this particular album involkes for me. A lot of No. 4 is heavy, and at times, just a bit to repetitive. However, the true jem of this album is without a doubt "" I Got You"", though ""Sour Girl"" is a close second. If your in a bit of a angry mood ""down"" may strike a chord or 2 with you. But the ballads are without a doubt the stars of this album, and i'm sorry, but there just aren't enough of them. However its pretty much worth buying the album just for ""I got you."" I dont buy albums for a single song, but it is just that good."
5,Wow!,"I didn't think it would be this great. STP to me have always been good, but not great. However, this one blew me away. Obvious Doors influence in some tracks, and they sound great. Very, vey good. Buy it now."
1,Awful,"STP has gone continuously downhill since Purple. Tiny Music was an average album with a few listenable songs but overall was very boring. No. 4, on the other hand, hardly bears listening. The songs are pounding and repetetive, more annoying than edifying. I found nothing to like about anything in this album.The conclusion: buy Core and Purple, they're both great. If you feal adventurous, buy Tiny Music. No. 4 is by a different band entirely, and I would not recommend it."
2,Not The Best,"Stone Temple Pilots is one of the more stunning grunge groups, with amazing songs, however i was the least bit impressed by no.4 it was what you get if you mixed the dave matthews band and pearl jam, it was good all the same but nothing compared to any of there other albums. The Skinny:Best song-Sex and violenceand down"
4,a bit of a letdown,"number 4 has some of stp's best songs on it, but is nowhere near as consistent as their previous work. That said, if you are a pilots fan it's still a good buy"
2,"STP, What Have You Done?","This is one of the top bands of all time, but what the hell is this album. It is NOTHING like the other three great albums. Although a few songs rock, this album is very hard to get used to, after about five listens, I finally got into 2 or 3 songs. I hope they do better next time, it's just a shame."
4,STP are Back!,"I was less than impressed with Tiny Music. That's why I let out a sigh of relief when I heard the first minute of the opening song Down. It seemed Weiland (and his voice) were back. After the whole album was over though I had somewhat mixed feelings. None of the songs were bad but only a few (No Way Out, Atlanta, Glide, and Sour Girl) really stood out. The others just seemed mediocre. That might be a little bit of an overstatement though because after more listens I did grow to like them a bit more. Still however though this is no Purple. But compared to the musical scene at the time, this was a disc to embrace and certainly better than Tiny Music."
2,"It was OK, but not even close to what I was expecting.","Maybe I was expecting too much from No.4, but I was sorely disappointed with this album.There just weren't any memorable tracks on the album.I loved Core, Purple, and Tiny Music,and have all three at home.Songs such as Interstate Love Song,Plush,and Lady Picture Show are where they are at their best.The album was not extremely bad, but it was it was just missing that extra something that their previous albums had.It has a couple of good songs on it,such as Atlanta and Sour Girl, but has some others that you might want to skip through. Bottom Line: Listen to it before you buy it!"
3,CORE IS THE BEST!,"I really hope that STP will go back to their roots of CORE, because thats the BEST one they ever did and will probably ever do. Too bad :("
3,"Nowhere near as good as ""Purple"", but still worth buying","""Purple"" is still the best CD that STP has cut. This CD is a little bland, with just a couple of tracks that really stand out."
4,"Although it's different from past material, it's great!","Although this disc is a little short, it ROCKS! ""Heaven & Hot Rods"" is worth the price of the CD alone. It does not sound like the other STP discs, but it still sounds great. I would've given it five stars if it were longer."
2,"IF YOUR BUYING IT CUZ U LIKED ""DOWN"", THEN DONT!","Ive never been and STP fan, but i had hoped they changed after hearing ""Down"" on the radio.. which is a great song. But after buying the CD, i found that none of the other songs on the CD are anything like that. Most of them are pathetic attempts by Scott Weiland to try and ""sing"" which end up becoming so painful to the ear that it makes u turn off the stereo.If u only liked ""Down"" please reconsider buying the CD, none of the other songs are even close to of that quality."
4,STP come back!,"I am so happy Weiland and crew got back with each other. I waited 3 years on buying this album, and it wasn't bad at all. There's lotsa songs that have a clearer voice, though I wasn't expecting this because Weiland was arrested, and in probition. ""Heaven & Hot Rods"" is my favorite song throughout the disc. ""No Way Out"" is that most recent single from STP. Scott's voice sounds like Ed Roland(Collective Soul) and Live. I also think ""Glide"" reminds me of Radiohead. The guitar riffs are pretty good exc. Sex& Violence, otherwise excellent. It is a good thing they've came back, with a more leveled voice."
2,Disappointing,"I've always enjoyed STPs tracks and I read the Rolling Stone reviews which said ""they have saved rock and roll..."" or something like that. All of thr tracks sound the same. Vocals are very much blah sey and often muffled, depressing in a way, but maybe that was the intent. The instrumental portion was mostly disappointing. I expected heart pounding beats and crashing guitar licks. All I heard was techno-fusion rock, no identity. I hate to coin the phrase, ""it all sounded the same"" but that just about sums it up. If rock and roll was meant to be saved, this CD won't do it."
4,Fantastic 4,"Personally, I didn't care much for the last album, and I like this one alot more. I think with ""Tiny Music..."" they got the arty stuff out of their system, and decided that on ""4"" it was time to rock again. No grunge here either, just rock, minus the few soft spots. ""Down"" was the first single and opener, and sets the pace for the majority of the album. ""Sour Girl"" was another hit, and could have been a leftover from the third album. Two others I like are ""I Got You"", which is a real finger-snapper, and ""Atlanta"", which is the best Doors song the Doors never wrote. This doesn't really touch the first two albums, but it's a solid disc, and what else could you ask 4?"
3,STP Returns,"In between the time Stone Temple Pilots released Tiny Music in 1996 and No. 4 in 1999, lead singer Scott Weiland spent more time in and out of jail and drug rehab than on stage. STP appeared to be in danger as the three other members branched off in another band called Talk Show and Mr. Weiland released a solo album. But against all odds, the band returned with No. 4 that is a solid, but not great album. The time off created some rust, but there is enough good music included to make it worth the while. ""Down"" is a crunching rocker in the classic STP style while ""Atlanta"" has a mystical, swirling sound. But the real attraction here is ""Sour Girl"" which is the best song the band has ever recorded. The song has a quiet, mellow rhythm and Mr. Weiland provides the most textured and commanding vocal of his career. No. 4 showed the band still had their chops and were not doomed to be a casualty of the rock 'n' roll drug wars."
3,Definetly not their best work,"After I bought this CD, I was quite disappointed. Not really by the songs themselves, because some of them were pretty good, Sour Girl and Down the true gems, but mostly because I knew that STP could do better. Take a look at Purple, for instance. There are so many great songs on that CD, certainly bringing out some of STP's best work. But still, I cannot say that this album is any better than their previous album, Songs From A Vatican Giftshop, in which some of the songs just were not good at all. Hopefully STP's newest album is better, because it would be truly disappointing if they offered another dismal album like this."
2,A so-so release by a once great band,"This album starts out strong with 3 decent tracks, then becomes Tiny Music part 2. I bought STP's last two albums on the strength of Core and Purple; I won't buy the next one."
5,Lucky number four,"I think everyone at one point in their lives has liked STP. I have. I still do. This is their most complete work. Way more accessible than some of their earlier jams. They rock it out, they slow it down, and show what they are truly capable of. Definately not locked in grunge mode unlike bands they rivaled back in STP's early days. In the long run, this CD didnt change music like Wicked Garden, but I think it is much better than it.Without writing a documentary, I really think it is such a shame to see Scott in Velvet Revolver. Pick up what you had brother and run with it!"
3,I Like,"I have to say, i really enjoy this album. Its suprisingly very good.....from the hard heavy tracks, to the melon collie ballads, to the soaring mid-tempo pieces....it has it all!!!!!Its dark, and full of emotion, pick it up....its a good listen!"
2,Stone Temple Pilots got weak,"The Stone Temple Pilots are without a doubt one of the best bands around, what in the world happened. This group has 3 of the best albums known to man, and then they come out with this jam session CD. I cannot get a grasp of this CD, I've listened to it over and over, but I just don't hear anthing good going on. I say pick up the first 3 albums, but leave this one alone."
3,It is alright......but......,"The new album is alright but not what alot of people will be expecting. With 'Down' being the only song on the album that follows their typical formula, the rest of the album left me searching for somthing more familiar. Some of the songs have grown on me like 'Sour Girl' and 'MC5' others have not. I will say the song 'Altanta' made me think that Jim Morrison had come back from the dead."
3,Back to form... Kind of,"I suppose I should say that I enjoy this album much more than the last one. Many of the songs are reminiscent of their first album, Core. And I have to admit that a good portion of this record really rocks. There seems to be some anymosity fueling the fires of songwriting on this one. There are moments, however, that sound more like ""Tiny Music"" or more dubiously Scott Weiland's solo album. This record is a borderline 4 star effort, and if you like ""Tiny Music"" and ""Core,"" you'll probably dig ""No. 4,"" but I can't give it that strong of an endorsement. One thing I will say, is that the richness of Scott's voice seems to be returning a bit, though it will probably never get back to where he was on ""Plush."""
2,"Not good, but unfortunately better than most stuff out there","For the most part this is an aggressive, straight-ahead album. Weiland's vocals are strong, but I found only a couple tunes I could latch onto, and I've given it a few tries. For the most part I wish they'd speed up the tempo sometimes and rock faster. Songs seem to drag a bit.Not that this matters too much, but there's probably not a radio-worthy tune here. Better luck next time. And it'll be awhile, cuz Weiland's going to jail for a year, I guess.Listen before you buy."
4,i dig it,"Of course they have a newer sound. Jail ,treatment ,and funky relationships will do that to a band. It's not a loud album but not something to sleep to. If your already a fan your going to love it. If your not you may like it but you'll like there previous a little better.I like it. I like it when a band will use a new sound and keep there old one at the same time. And thats it damn it."
3,S.T.P.... Not the same.... But good,"This c.d is ""o.k."" for S.T.P. standards.I personally think that they could have done better, but I have to admit the c.d. has grown on me. The best song so far is ""DOWN"".I'm really liking the hardcore rock sound of this song. They should definitely stick to the sound they have created with""DOWN""."
4,At least 5 classic STP tunes,"Down, Heaven & Hot Rods, Church on Teus., No way Out, and the best song STP has done yet--Glide.Sure, the length is thin, but the sound is great. One thing creeps me out, though. That picture of Weiland inside the CD is incredibly scary. He does not look well and it scares the hell out of me just looking at it. What a creepy dude he is. Yeah, they've sold out.....yadda yadda. But it sounds good."
5,Atlanta,"she lives by the wall and waits by the door,she walks in the sun to me...i say this album is fantastic and Atlanta is one of the most emotional songs i've heard from those guys...god bless STP they still kick A@@"
3,Decent at best,"I was very disappointed in this when it came out. Compared to the last three albums, this was a disappointment. There are some good songs on here, but overall the album is a dud."
2,Ranking their albums this would be No. 4,"As a huge STP fan I was definitely disappointed with this album, I've tried and tried but I just can't get into it. I've always thought of STP as a modern day LED ZEPPELIN, but this one falls quite a bit short of their 4th album! If you're new to STP start with Purple, if you're a fan wait and hope..."
4,4.9 stars.........nearly a masterpiece,"I only give 5 stars to a record that is a truemasterpiece. This album comes close. It shows true maturity in a greatrock band. I would consider it STP's best. The first three songs are hard hitting blow your ears out rock. Atlanta is a dreamy Doors like cut, and Glide is an anthem like song that is truely motivational. In my book, it is a definite classic. This is a very diverse record, but isn't radical. I am still longing for a band to come out and break all of the rules."
4,"The more you listen, the better it gets!","I'm a huge STP fan so I was initially disappointed with No. 4. However, the more I listened to it, the better it got. The songs reflect his fight to live and stay clean and his sorrow and anger for losing his lover. The music in ""I Got You"" is a great catchy tune and ""Atlanta"" is the most beautiful song they've done to date. It's so grand. The music is very very strong; however, it lyrically is a little weak. Scotts creative writing of lyrics may have been clouded by everything that's gone on in his life. If you're a true STP fan, get it. Nobody sings like Scott Weiland."
5,STP has restored my faith in hard rock,"This is an incredible CD. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing these tunes for the past week. Yeah, the lyrics are a bit weird what with Weiland's everlasting battle with Heroin. The music, however, thrives with abundant energy, tasteful economy, and Weiland's harmonic, melodic vocals have never been better. I rate this as the hard rock album of the year. It also contains some beautiful ballads like ""Sour Girl"". Even Rolling Stone gave it three stars and they don't exactly have a love affair with the band. Also, check out the interview with the band in Raygun. Let's hope Weiland can be back with the guys for a tour next year."
3,A solid sound from STP,"This album is good for all the STP fans who have been longing for new material. While the first listen may not catch you right away, you will find yourself humming the tunes off of it. No top 40 rock except for ""Down"" and that's OK as Weiland needs room to show his talented songwriting as well as his self-examination in his lyrics. Great guitar work by the DeLeo's. The tune ""Atlanta"" brings you into the dreamy etherial sounds of the Doors as a reminder of where we once were and where we are going. All STP fans should love this album as it shows the natural progression that the band is making."
4,Solid,"It seems to me STP want nothing more than to put out albums that rock and that's exactly what they do here on ""No.4"". Sure it's nothing that's going to redefine rock and roll as we know it but what the hell, it's really good. I have a feeling it's going to be one of those creepers that takes a few listens before really sinking in, much like my favorite STP album, ""Tiny Music..."". Too bad Weiland's in the tank again."
5,i can play it all... and when that happens i love the album!,4 will be NO. 1 in a couple of weeks or at least reach 2. Unfortunately America does not want R n R right now. About 4 yrs. ago it would have debuted at #1!
4,Awesome,This Album is awesome! If u liked Core then u should buy this exciting album.Top Songs:Sour GirlChurch On TuesdayHeaven and Hot Rods
3,#4,"this is a good hard rock CD. with the exception of ""sour girl"", most of the tracks are similar driving rock guitar with wyland's unique voice over. scott wyland and company have locked on to a formula that works, and this CD is it. it lacks the catchy, driving guitar lines found on purple and the experimentation found on tiny music, but while its not full of incredible tracks, you can put it on and listen to it front to back without skipping over anything, which is more than i can say of some CDs i own."
2,Very good,I'm glad to see a good group playing together again after the Scott Wheilan's problem with heroin. Because of that I want to listen the new cd.
4,A tribute to longevity,This album is a tribute to their lasting appeal and longevity despite their trials and tribulations. The continuity of the album and the length are the only elements against it. The album comes in at about 45 minutes long.
1,a sad and dark day for stone temple pilot fans,"i was real excited when i heard that stp was recording a new album. i always loved stp. songs like inerstate love song, creep , big bang baby, meat plow, sextype thing were songs that i could listen to over and over and never get tired of. stp seemed to put mind body and soul into the chords and amazing guitar riffs on the first three albums. then no. 4 came out. its just not stp. but thats just me."
4,"A great CD, but far from perfect","This album was dubbed by many rock critics to be ""the album that will save rock music"". The fact of the matter is that there are many songs on this album that rock, but it is more a sensitive album that is full of emotion. If you have followed stp's career, these songs will touch your heart and make you feel good. I'd recommed this album to anyone."
3,NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE,"I am the fan of STP, Big Empty - Creep - Interstate Love Song - Dead & BLoated - Silvergun Superman - Big Bang Baby - Ungived - Vasoline - Wicked Garden. These are their greats and unfortunetly I havn't heard anything on this new CD to even come close to them. I encourage STP cause I love them so much. The songs are ok on this CD but nothin like the oldschool STP !"
4,STP are not really one band,"It's not very easy to explain this, but essentially STP are not one band, or at least cannot be thought of like that. I remember how much I loved Core when it came out, and then really hated Purple because it was nothing like Core. As time went on I started really liking Purple, then I bought Tiny Music and the same thing happened...At the end of the day, you can't really go around drawing really direct comparisons between their albums or saying how much better / worse they've got, because it's groundless. Each album should be looked at as a debut album, not from a new band, but for a new direction.This album is really good, with very insightful and quite cryptic songs, and, although not as personally enlightening or pleasing as Tiny Music was for me, is certainly not a 'dissappointment'."
3,Lovely moments but not their best.,"No. 4 by Stone Temple Pilots almost never happened but singer Scott Weiland finally cleaned up his act and got sober for this ambitious album. Songs like Sour Girl, Down, S*x and Violence, and my personal fave Atlanta are excellent tracks but the rest of the album is pretty much filler. Weiland's voice is in fine tune but the rest of the band seems tired and uninspired. This is a mixed bag for me."
3,Go Scotty Go,"It's just plain cool the way Scott pronounces ""Waiting"" as ""Way-TAN!"" It just kills me. Makes me want to jump around the living room and pound on stuff.Notice how, on the opening track 'Down,' he takes only 4 couplets for verses, 1 line for a chorus, and one line for a bridge. It's the same lyrical economy he used on 'Dead & Bloated.' He's not writing an extensive lyrical masterpiece here. The words simply function as a vehicle for his a$$-kicking DELIVERY.Now that's' what I've been Way-TAN for!Nice vocal nod to Ozzy Osbourne on the bridge, too."
5,Love these,Everyone was complaining they came a size too small so I ordered a size up. That's what I get for listening. Still love them regardless.
2,Run SMALL,"These panties run super small. I'm a size 10, currently 150lbs and the XLpanties barely fit me?! Thats fine I don't care what the tag says but at least make some 4XLs that will fit the normal sized women!!"
5,Celtic Pride: Irish Dance (Featuring--The Irish Ceili Band),"This is an excellent CD if you like the Irish sound. With a mix of instramentals and folk tunes, this is among my favorites. I would highly recommend this for any Irish collection."
1,Nothing new here; just a remake of previous one's,"Like many parents of toddlers and preschoolers, I have found the Mighty Machine video's among the best available. They are entertaining and well-made, and parents can learn quite a bit as well. When I saw there was a new one, I quickly pre-ordered it from Amazon. When it arrived, we excitedly opened it and our 3 year-old son was excited. We told him a ""new Mighty machines"" had arrived. Unfortunately, there is nothing new about his video. It shows short clips from old episodes, and while they are well made, there is nothing new here. He quickly noticed as well, as we all felt like we had been duped. If you want to watch the real Mighty Machine's order the old ones. If you want to waste your money on something ""new"", then this is for you."
1,what a rip off,"I also pre ordered this video as it was described to be a brand new one, I dont know who was more mad when it arrived, me or my sonIf you own all of these dvd's DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS"
1,Bad switch Design,UPDATE 7-29-08I changed my mind about this particular impact wrench. I loved it when it was working only used it maybe 10 times and it has already broken.Bad switch design for the forward reverse...My reverse stopped working. Took it apart and it seems they use a very cheap switch design on this.
3,"Gets the job done, not very sturdy","I used to have a plastic folding drying rack, and it was very sturdy and could be moved across the room without issue. However, this one constantly becomes detached at the top and falls over if I try to move it over a couple feet while it's unfolded and in use, and it's pretty irritating. It's fine for drying clothes, but it doesn't stay up very well."
5,very convinient,"The design is excellent. Allows lots of space for hanging many garments at once, yet let enough space in between for air circulation and drying."
1,Rusted within 2 months...bad choice,"Completely rusted within 2 months. It was always unstable and rickety, would fall all the time. And then it started to rust. I called amazon who then asked me to contact 'Household Essentials'. They said they can send me a replacement but not a refund. So, end of story and $28."
1,piece of junk,"I bought this rack hoping that a metal one would last longer than the wood ones that I have used over the last 10 years.I bought this rack in January, 2010. By March, 2010 and maybe 6 loads of laundry, it had fractured at a pivot point, rendering the rack useless.If I had known it would only last a few months, I would have bought 3 wood racks that would have lasted for several years.Hands down, this is one of the worst things I have ever purchased."
5,Drying rack.,Still in use after several years. No problems encountered. Very good quality. Chrome still looks great. Used daily. Sturdy metal construction. Only requires occasional (once a year depending on how many times it's folded up; we leave ours up a lot) tightening of the joint screws. Highly recommend.
1,Doesn't hold up over time.,"After a couple of years of use, the horizontal bars started falling out and were impossible to re-install (even by my husband who can fix anything). After three years of use, so many have fallen out that the rack is unusable."
2,light but flimsy,"This rack is light and true to the picture. But it's too flimsy, it broke after 20 days."
5,Happy with Product!!!,"I received my rack within a couple days of ordering it, and it qualified for free shipping. That was a plus since I was worried about shipping costs all the way to Alaska. I put a load of sweatshirts, jeans, and cargo pants on it and it stayed really stable. When I took the dry clothes off I just popped one of the bars up and it folded down on its own and was easily stored. It also had no assembly required, which is great since almost all of the others available are extremely complicated to put together."
1,DO NOT BUY - Rusts w/in 1 month!,"I have purchased similar chrome racks over the years and have never had a problem with them, specifically with rust (even after 3-4 years of use). I bought this horrible product and it rusted after one month of careful, normal, indoor use. This product is a complete rip-off. You should only buy this rack if you don't mind your clean clothes hanging on a rusty rung. I wish I had listened to previous reviews that warned of rust. Please do not buy! Horrible product!"
1,Not,The third time I used this product it started to come apart. Various cross bars came apart in the center and at the ends. It was not handled roughly. I would not recommend this for anyone.
1,it broke,I'm a single person and only used it for drying clothes from the laundromat and IT BROKE! Expensive item for only 3 months use!
1,Cheap,I used this product three times and it broke. It is cheap and flimsy. I would not recommend it.
2,Bad coating quality,The rack has been delivered with two rusted rods. I did not return it because of shipping cost.
2,not good,i was completely shocked once i received the rack. most of the reviews gave this item a 4 or 5 but i honestly think it sucks. first of all this rack is not made for adult clothes but really for kids. if you hang a shirt or shorts it completely covers the bottom racks which then become useless. second of all the 4 racks on top can barely fit 2 clothing pieces! third of all the rack is not sturdy which basically means you cant place heavy items on it like towels because otherwise it will fall. i can say this...if you have small children this definitely can work for you but otherwise it sucks!
5,great drying rack,"This is a great drying rack, much more stable and sturdy than similar wooden ones I've had in the past. It comes pre-assembled and folds up very small-- I store it next to my washing machine. In winter time I put the rack in the bathtub to dry the clothes. I can dry 1 or two loads on it at a time, especially if I use the lowest bars for things like undies and socks. In the summer I keep it on the deck. I am very happy with this purchase. This product was a little more expensive than the wooden racks I've seen at stores in town, but totally worth it. Highly recommended."
5,Sturdy,"No more spending extra money to replace those flimsy wooden racks every couple of months. We have cats who love to climb up the racks full of laundry. These have even been able to with stand a load of wash and 2 cats at one time. Shipped extremely fast and free (amazing). Will spend a bit more for the quality, but value far exceeds the price. My wooden racks had a funny smell when they got wet- don't miss that at all now."
4,Drying rack to help conserve energy and go green,"This drying rack fits nicely inside our second bathroom shower stall area. I just fluff up my wet laundry for 10 minutes in the regular dryer and then transfer items to the drying rack. Some items go on hangers that I place on the shower rod. I've got a great little laundry drying area in a seldom used shower unit. Chrome drying rods; although a mite flimsy, won't mildew and clean up nicely."
3,Will rust,I gave this unit to my girl friend who lives about 12 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. Within 2 weeks it began to rust.This unit may be fine for those areas that have absolutely no salt in their air but I would not recommend this forothers.
4,solid and 'green',Much better than the $10 wood ones that are the same size. These can handle anything you put on them without getting wobbly.We have two and rarely ever use the dryer any more. It's a big savings on electricity and the clothes are never wrinkled because you left them in the dryer. Clothes last a lot longer with out going through the dryer as well.
4,worth the money,The portable clothes drying rack did the trick. Easy to set up. Much more stable and solid than privios racks I bought. Go for it!
4,Almost Perfect!,"Five years ago, I bought a chrome drying rack from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. It was sturdy (thick metal cross braces) and I went looking for another. There is no brand name stamped into the product, so I went to the same store looking for the product. That store now carries a cheaply made, poor excuse for the former product. So, I tried this one. The Whitney drying rack is much better than anything that I could find at any of my local stores. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it isn't quite as sturdy as my first one (thinner cross braces). However, this one is much preferred over the junk that they are trying to get us to buy at the big box retailers."
5,Best drying rack ever,"I used to use wooden drying racks and this is such a better upgrade. Its durable, lightweight, and works well."
5,Exactly as described,Just what I was looking for. Lightweight but firm construction. No assembly needed.
2,not sturdy enough,"I bought this drying rack because I thought a metal one might stand up to heavy use and a cat that had already destroyed a wood one and a plastic one. However, in less than three weeks of use, one side of it has collapsed so it is significantly lower than the other. It still works; I just wish it were sturdier. It can't tolerate much weight.Update: a few weeks later, one of the major support bars snapped in half (yeah, I thought it was supposed to be metal). It was basically unusable. I'm very disappointed."
2,Poor construction,"This item is a simple drying rack. To me, that means it should have one important quality: be sturdy. It doesn't have that quality. After about a month of use, the rack became tilted. I was willing to accept this because it was still usable. About two months later, I had a decent amount of wet clothes on it, and it flat out collapsed because one of the rods broke.There's no reason this rack should be so poorly constructed. It isn't even that light, so it's surprising that it wouldn't be able to hold up after normal useage."
4,pretty good rack...,"I have been using this rack for over a month now and have found it fulfills its purpose adequately. Positives: sturdy; doesn't take up too much room. Negatives: small gouge in the chrome on one bar which has begun to rust slightly; it doesn't hold as many items as clothes racks I have had in the past. FYI - 25 feet of hanging space roughly equals a medium load of washing, it certainly won't handle a full load."
5,The Return of a Legend,"I've been a fan of Mark Spoelstra's music since the mid-sixties and have acquired everything he has done. I can recommend "" Out of my Hands"" to anybody whose is into acoustic/blues/american folk. Mark has always been his own man, never mimicking black blues artists unlike many of his comtemporaries from the 60s. He always brings that elusive "" something"" to his recordings, that quality that make his records "" special"". Buy this record and obtain a piece of a true American original."
5,Amazing,"Wow. We just bought this CD, and I'm totally in love with it.I've never had the pleasure of meeting Mark - he is my husband's uncle.Chip has some great memories of listening to his uncle play the guitar and sing.I highly recommend this CD and any other of Mark's. He is a rare and gifted musician and songwriter."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this about 8 months ago, and over the last 3 months it has gradually stopped playing my CDs. It's always been utterly useless in the cold, and EVERY bump it skips regardless. It could never read half of my CDs, even ones I bought that same day. I'm replacing it right now, and I wish i had just bought a decent player from the start."
4,The True Inside Story of the Chicago Bulls,"Blood on the Horns gives excellent insight into the greatest NBA dynasty ever-the Chicago Bulls. This book describes how the rift between Phil Jackson and Jerry Krause developed, and how the rest of the team rallied around Jackson. Particular attention is paid to the 1997-98 season and the long drive toward a 6th NBA championship. There will never be another team like the Chicago Bulls, and this book is worth reading by all true Bulls fans."
1,Not worth the money,"...a rehash of well known facts. Also, the fact that it is stuffed with text from various press conferences made me want to become a sports writer if that's how easy it is! Also, I worked for publishing companies and we used to proof read before we went to press!"
4,Great book; but I liked the first one more.,"I loved the author's first book. The sequel is very good, but it is deeper into the subject matter than the original. It is not as fast of a pace than the author's first work, but the resources used and accuracy of information is definately there. These are both books that you can place on your coffee table and your guests will pick them out and won't be able to put them down until they have read each and every word. This author has a very sincere attitude and quite a unique way of looking at the world around us. If you don't buy and read this sequel and the original you are definately missing out! I recommend these books to everyone I meet."
5,Spidey,"I really like this figure! It is my favorite Spider man that I own. He has a cloth costume, which is really cool, because they don't do that any more. It is really poseable also. If you are a Marvel fan you would love this spidey! I am looking forward to getting more of these types to add to my collection."
5,LOVE this product!!,"I have spent a great deal of money on laundry sorters over the years and I wish I would've found this one a long time ago. It's sturdy and stays together unless you want it to come apart, which is a nice change from the ones I had in the past. It costs a little more but well worth every penny I paid. I would recommend it to everyone!"
5,THE PICK UP GAME,"I purchased this because I was in desperate need for a clutter free zone. My kids actually pick up their own clothes instead of the maid doing it all the time. And trust me, the maid(mom) does not get paid enough to pick up after 3 super messy kids. It works well, seems sturdy enough and if I find something else that's better, I can always take it outside and use if for sports equipment. It's a little on the expensive side, but I think it's worth it."
5,Absolutely love!,"Much larger capacity than appears in the picture. I bought 2, one would have been sufficient. Put them together with my kids (ages 10 and 12) since it was that easy. They enjoyed that. Rolls easily, keeps the clothes organized for the wash. Keeps my kids organized when they bring laundry to the basement. A definite A+ in design and meeting an organizational need."
2,Not worth the money paid.,"For what I paid for this thing, I expected better quality. The bags are flimsy, and the overall unit is not so sturdy. That being said, it is compact enough to only take up a little bit of floor space."
3,needs better wheels,Great idea but needs better wheels. Presorting the laundry saves me 30 minutes and putting the cart on wheels saves my back - sort of. One wheel snapped off so I have to lift the cart and put the wheel back on at the two steps that I hit on my way to the laundry room.
5,Laundry Sorter,"Great product, sturdy, easy to put together. I like the ventilation, which helps keep damp towels, etc. from getting musty. Couldn't be more pleased with it."
2,Works well for awhile,"I have no problem with the base, but after 2 years, the bags are ripped and useless. To my knowledge, there is no way to just buy replacement bags. This is incredibly frustrating."
3,Putting it together,I might just be a lucky one. Extra tools needed! Crazy Glue and arc welder. I put the wheels on and need to change locations. Wanted both locking wheels on the same side. My Fault. In the process of taking the bottom off because I put it on upside down one of the plastic pinch washer cracked. the Glue made it as good as new. One of the braces for the bottom section welds gave out.Would I buy it again? Yeah I like blue.
2,Flimsy,When we put this product together it was found to be flimsy and one of the wheels broke right off the bat.
5,A great product,I have used grommet held canvas sorters in the past and they just don't hold up. I have used this sorter for a month now and I really love it.It is sturdy and was easy to assemble. The only problem I have had is that I cannot fit two of them side by side in the space I have available to me. I will figure that one out myself. Thanks for creating a better quality product at a reasonable price. I will let my friends know.
5,A godsend for all the outside toys,"I bought this for all my son's outside toys. Balls, bats, frisbees, etc... works great! The wheels make it easy for him to wheel it in and out of the garage. When he's done, he likes to put all the toys back in the sorter and wheels it in the garage again. I bought this in the beginning of the summer. It's been a true godsend. No more replacing a ball because it's been run over with the car AGAIN!"
4,Glad to have for a Big Family!,"Ok! Here's the deal needed something to hold the family laundry until laundry day. It needed to have easily removeable sorting bags and be wheeled around from one room to another. Needed something heavy duty to hold the weight of the laundry until laundry day. So, I found one at Target that feel apart and was plastic with mesh bags that ripped.Then I found a canvas one but, the bags were sewn together and I tried to rig it like this one but, it didn't work. Then I found this one finally!It does all the above and more. The part more is the whole family likes the cool color of it and it has become the thing to fight over on who gets to sort, fill, and push it to the washer. (an these are boys doing this of a big age range!) So, needless to say I'm getting more of these in the future. P.S. I know the color but, if you have kids and they fight over who's doing the laundry. You just love the color and be greatful for the help! Hope this helps you moms & Mr. moms out there!"
2,SO HANDY! Just one problem..,"The Good:I can sort my laundry!I can roll my laundry around!I can bag up my laundry and then wash the bags so when my laundry is really dirty it doesn't dirty up everything else too!The bad:The little plastic widget that holds the string tight so the bags closed (clasp) does not have enough spring power to hold diddly squat.The bags coulda used a handle.All and all, worth the money but I'd pay an extra $10 for better bags. =)UPDATE 9/5/2011:One of the bags is all ripped up now from being used/washed/stuffed/etc. And Walmart is selling a similar product for $23 that looks sturdier. I am annoyed."
3,Nice laundry sorter for $$$,"This laundry sorter is pretty good, especialy for the price. Note that the thing arrived with one broken wheel but a phone call to the maker resulted in them sending me a whole new leg. So far, I like my sorter."
5,Awesome sorter,"This sorter is great! We previously owned a cheaper sorter, but it fell apart within a year and is now in the garbage. This one is very sturdy. We were concerned that it was too small when we bought it online, but it is HUGE. Each bag holds way more than a full load of laundry. The bags are easy to remove from (and put back on) the frame and then carry to my laundry area. I highly recommend this sorter to anyone who needs to carry their laundry to their laundry area and who has lots of space to put the sorter."
4,Nice laundry organizer,"So far, so good. Only complaints are that it came with the wheels attached which made it very hard to put together correctly. Also, the bins are held on only by velcro. Hopefully it will stay attached well but it could have been made better. So far though for the price, I am pleased."
4,Just as Expected,Really like this unit for laundry sorting. Only one thing I wish is that you could purchase replacement bags if needed. Couldn't find that as an option. One other picky point which has nothing to do with product but it would be nice if bags were available in a couple of colors.
5,pool supply cart,"I teach water fitness, and therapy. This cart is fantastic for holding supplies with adequate ventilation."
5,This is exactly what I was looking for in a hamper!,This laundry sorter has been so amazing. The bags look small but each of them holds almost 2 laundry loads while being completely sturdy. The metal structure took about 5 minutes to put together and also seems to be of good construction. This has made my life much easier so my husband and I can sort our laundry as we hamper it rather than right before doing the laundry when loads get skewed in size after splitting.
5,Love this!!,I was looking for an inexpensive laundry sorter - i went to a few stores and found some cheaper than this product but they were horribly constructed. My mom has this sorter and reccommended it to me so i decided to spend the 50 bucks and get it. I love it. It holds a LOT of clothes and is very sturdy. Only downside is i wish it wasn't blue but rather brown or black so it matched with my decor better but oh well... it does the job!!
5,This bin rocks,"I have two of these. The first one I bought I fell in love with and the store no longer carried it when I decided to purchase another. I found on here, and purchased it. It differs very mildly to the original I had bought, but sill operates in the same fashion. Bags are strong, frame is strong, you can take these things to the laundry mat if you need to, or just bring laundry up and down stairs with no problems. Buy this bin!!"
2,Not the most sturdy in design.,"The assembly of this product was not well-designed. The clips that hold the metal racks in place slide around during assembly and it made it difficult to make all four wheels level. Overall, I do not think this product is very sturdy or durable.Though, once it was put together I do enjoy sorting my laundry in it. I think in the end, I like the concept of the product better than the actual product. Shop around for a different brand before buying this one."
2,Good while it lasted,"This was great at first. The problem came after about two months when one of the wheels broke off. I kept on trying to use it but to no avail. For the price, it could be better made. I will go cheaper this time. No sense in over spending for junk."
5,Great product!,"Great and durable product. We always have a lot of laundry. This holds it all nicely and makes it incredibly easy to sort. If you have a whole bunch of laundry, the bag will rest on the bottom shelf instead of pulling off the frame, or causing the frame to buckle. Best thing I've purchased for my home lately."
2,Time will tell,Time will tell if this product is worth the price paid. The plastic connectors that support the frame seem cheap and poorly made. One arrived broken in half. The upper frame was bent. Both had to be replaced and that took 3 weeks. I'm concerned about the supports coming apart with use. We'll see.
3,Great--if it hadn't arrived flawed.,"I think this sorter is fantastic, except for the fact that it arrived with a broken piece of metal frame and one of the velcro connections was the same as what it was supposed to attach to--just be warned. When I spend $40+ I expect somewhat better workmanship."
4,Not bad for the money.,This was easy to assemble. It is very functional. It is not terribly sturdy but you do not need that for holding laundry. I would not use this for storing anything heavy.
1,Wow what a waste,This product is very difficult to assemble. Also when I opened the product from the box it stunk so bad on dead fish that we had to wash the sorters several times to get the smell out. Waste of time and money.
5,Sturdy,"I've had this hamper for over a year now and it's still standing strong. I love it, the price was great,easy to put together,and oh so durable. This is a great iteam,and the three compartments are just a bonus."
4,machine love,"it's good stuff. however, i'm not as impressed by it as i am by some other remix cds i like (i'm primarily thinking of nine inch nails here, which may not be fair). the remixes i like will completely rebuild a track and make it really different -- take it in a wholly new direction. the remixes on this are just technoish versions of the originals. as such, they don't completely wow me. (well, okay, i do really like the remix of Sin City. :) but they *are* good, and the cd is worth getting if you like this band."
4,good but....,"it will never top 120 days, their first release. the only song i listen to is touch myself. it sound a little too electronic for my taste. kinda like a lords of acid/republica sound. you can't beat the first release."
5,incredible remix album,"it's not every day i actually like a remix album, in fact, i usually hate remixes; they always seem like an unneccessary, uninspired space filler, but the genitorturers have remixed these tracks so well that if you had never heard the originals, you might think these WERE the originals. these songs are a little more dancable (not to mention just as good for pounding the mattress), but that's not always a bad thing. the cover of ""i touch myself"" is absolutely gorgeous, one of those rare covers that are better than the original artist's rendition. of course, i'm probably a little biased (one look at gen and you will understand why). if you haven't heard the genitorturers, either get sin city if you prefer to hear the originals, or get this if you prefer something with more of a club beat, both of these albums are a great introduction to this incredible band."
2,"""When I think about you I touch myself...""","I don't usually get introduced to a band's sound via a remix album, but here it is: Best track by far is KMFDM's sado-masochistic remix of ""Sin City"" ... Yummy. ""Machine Love"" - ""c'moooon / c'mooon / feel my danger!"" - is sexy, moany and the ""I Touch Myself"" cover is gorgeous! The rest is unfortunately repetitive, depressing and boring by my taste - I assume they are a better stage-act."
3,The new stuff is great but ...,"... the remixes [were bad]. Completely. Totally. No ifs, ands, ors, or buts.That said, the album was worth buying if only for the cover of ""I touch myself."" I find that's really the only song I listen to on the disk. I'll listen to that one song and then put on Sin City or 120 Days instead ... Machine Love and Procession are good too, though."
3,Lacks in Production,"This album was just o.k. Most of the tracks were weak and the lyrics were also not too well thought up. It didn't have any catchy tunes and after playing it a couple of times, it does get boring. The only song that was above the rest was ""Raza Park"" and even that got tiresome after a while."
1,Disappointed by the product strength,"Bought this set for a suspension job on a VW car. The long allen bit is used to hold the stud while wrenching the nut. If you worked on European car suspensions, you will know that a long allen bit is required because it has to reach the hex through the center of the socket. The nut needs to be torqued to 44 ft-lbs. The 7mm allen bit snapped while tightening the nut on the strut and the ratchet hit me in the head. Not serious injury at all, but it is very disappointed that a good size (7mm) allen bit can snap under 44 ft-lb of torque or less. I have had done this kinda work multiple times and there is no bending load applied to the bit. I wish I can return it but it is just past the 30 days period. I guess you get what you paid for. The long sockets are prone to be weaker compared to the standard length ones. Save some hassle and buy the gearwrench brand."
5,Well Built & Functional,"Bought set to expand range and reach of existing Craftsman Hex Bit Sockets and they do that nicely. Despite length, good strength. Finish and overall quality appears to be good. In summary, they work."
4,Hex Socket set,"This was exactly what was described, it is a nice set to add to the rest of the tools. I like the longer hex to get into hard to reach spaces."
1,"Right packaging, wrong socket set","Although the outer packaging was correct, inside was the WRONG socket set. It was kind of a pain, as i had to return for a refund instead of just returning for the correct product."
5,I would kill to see this band live!,"I've been in love with Charles Bronson since 96' and now the singer is teaming up with 3/4 of the Locust?!?!?! Jeeze oh Pete that's sweet! This band doesn't really sound much like the Locust, but more like a vastly improved Charles Bronson. Real insane and incredibly awesome! Pick this up if you like music that is good."
5,Give it up... For the Holy Moly,"This a 2 mini disc set that totals out to be around 26 minutes. The first disc is said to have been recorded live at the local correctional facility on New Years 2001 & Disc 2 was done in the studio. Both sound equally as beautiful. The music itself is stellar, if you like anything on 31G you'll love this. For fans of The Locust, Head Wound City & The Blood Brothers. This is spastic synth grind for the open minded. I'm looking forward to the next release!"
3,calypso callaloo,truly gives you a feel for what early calypso was like. the steelband piece by Invaders is great.It gives you a true carnival feeling.
4,Audubon aren't keeping up their quality as they should,"Very cute and somewhat realistic; the only issue I have with this plush (and the newer Audubon birds made after 2010) is that the beak and claws are no longer made out of leather but cloth instead. When I bought an Audubon Red-Eye vireo that was made in 2003, it had a leather beak and good stitching quality. Disappointing, but nevertheless a decent toy for anyone to cuddle with or collect.The score would be a 3.5 due to Audubon's slack off in quality, but I gave it a 4 anyway."
1,WT....H??,"Length:: 1:00 MinsI bought this based on the other positive user reviews I found here. Unfortunately, I feel I cannot give a fair review of this product, as the batteries are worn out and there does not seem to be any way to replace them. The stitching is loose in the back of this ""toy"" Raven, so I can only assume this has already been ascertained by another disappointed buyer prior to me.Somehow...I don't think this lil guy is supposed to sound like this...and the company has refused my multiple attempts to receive any form of customer service from them...so if AMDL is the only company to buy it from...you'll be FAR better off waiting for someone else to list it.I'm just saying..."
5,Plush Raven,"I loved this plush bird. The voice is that of an actual raven, and the head is realistic, with feathers over the top of the bill."
5,better than OEM,These wires are well built and installed easily. They are all the same length for my 02 GMC 2500HD 8.1 liter. Should last another 100K miles as the OEM did.
5,"Wow, that School's in Session song is amazing!!!","I love the bonus track, School's in Session. It is a phenomonal song, and the band that did it is great. I love Four of Five. Make sure and check them out...Everyone go buy this cd and get ahold of Four of Five's other stuff, it's even better!!!"
4,"""Another Kind of Love""","Easily one of the most creative and weirdest videos ever. Good pulse on the song too. Was reminded of it in a flashbulb memory and found the video on YouTube. Check it out if the creativity of Peter Gabriel's ""Sledgehammer"" was a bit too nice for you. This tune's video isn't as complex, but it's much darker."
3,This book is very useful.,"Sometimes, people have to read one of these 6 plays in Spanish class. It is very difficult to comprehend. This really helped me understand the story fully. The stories in here are very well translated, and I recommend this book to anyone who has to read one of the six plays in Spanish class."
1,There Are Better Review Books Out There,"If you've worked in a pharmacy for years and math is a snap for you, then go ahead and buy this book. I is the cheapest and quickest certification guide out there. However, if you need to comprehensively review for the national certification exam, you'll need a much more in-depth book. This book only briefly mentions many important points, assuming that you already know them. Don't buy this book if you need a comprehensive review guide for the PTCB exam."
1,An outline for study,"This book is really nothing more than an outline for study and a collection of questions and one letter answers. It was also published at the inception of the pharmacy certification exam and the exam has changed substantially since then. The material contained in the text is really not much more that what is included with the exam packet, just expanded bit, and is now outdated in the level and breadth of knowledge which is expected from examinees with a passing score. Examinees would be better served by a more detailed, helpful, comprehensive and recently published text."
4,Lucky Letters,"I find this game to be very entertaining. I enjoy solving the puzzles. I also enjoy the timed ""Challenge Round"". It satisfies my competitive nature. The only negative is that occasionally there are problems with the graphics on the game. I have found that if I restart the game, the problems are solved."
3,Have trouble with Trivia Gems game,"I love the Lucky Letters game. I usually manage to solve the entire puzzle. Challenging and fun. But I have problems with Trivia Gems. Sometimes I can't get my chosen playing piece to jump on the categories to start the game. The times I did play it, I've never been able to complete the bonus round. This is my fault, not the computer's.Also in this package is Trivia 10, where you try to answer 10 facts on various trivia subjects. The more you get right in a row, the bigger your score. You also get a ranking by Pat, like Genius or something similar. I don't have to put the disc in my PC to play it. The Trivia Gems decompresses itself each time I try to play it. I just wish the game would work all the time when I want to play it."
5,great game,This game is a lot of fun to play and it really makes you think so your mind isn't going numb. It fun to try and beat your old scores everytime.
2,This is a dud.,My son tried this once and said it was no fun. It hasn't been used since. Stick with their Wheel of Fortune.
5,"""ah what the hell, i'll get one""","just recieved the K2 yesterday and was pretty impressed. took about 5 days to recieve. sharp out of the box. a little stiff on the opening but thats to be expected. nothing a little drop of oil wouldnt help. you could probably loosen the screw a bit but it didnt come with the necessary tool. its not a regular screw head or star either, its like a circle head with 4 notches on the outside. you can probably use pliers or something. good sized blade if you need something for your b.o.b. or for camping, maybe stash in the toolbox or tackle box. nice color. had it on me today and it felt secure. not to heavy to where i constantly noticed it. it was just chillin in the background while i worked. all in all, good sturdy blade (made in china i think, but what isnt these days) great buy, escpecially for the price!!! cant beat that. hope this helps."
3,"Decent, cheap knife.","Ok, I've had this knife for a little over a month now and have come to see it as a decent, inexpensive, light utility knife.I say light utility because I'm not too happy with the quality of the steel. After only a handful of openings the clip ad effectively etched the paint off the intersecting surface of the blade as well as taken some of the metal with it leaving the knife a little loose on the lock up.I don't carry this knife at all but I do leave it in my toolbox for the aforementioned light work. If you need something that will stand up to abuse pay a little more and either get one of the Dozier folders or go a little pricier and snag the Spyderco Tenacious."

3,"I wish she'd yelled just once-""shut up and listen"".","Back Cover description: She'd hired him as an escort...The wedding was to be a major social event-Georgina just couldn't face it on her own. How could she sit there and watch her ex-fiancé marry her beautiful, shallow cousin? A desperate solution was needed: a male escort!But he'd become the father of her child! Callum Stewart was perfect. Gorgeous, dynamic-he certainly made heads turn at the wedding! And he made Georgina's heart turn over on the wedding night. But it was supposed to be a temporary arrangement. How could she tell Callum that their wedding-night affair had resulted in a baby?He is not really an escort; he's her new boss. She doesn't find out until the next day. That's one storyline; this book has one too many which is why it has only 3 stars. It starts off funny, and then gets kind of nasty, then turns another way. Not bad, I just wish the author had fewer plotlines in this book."
2,Wedding Night Blunder,I didn't like Callum's attitude at the wedding of hers for that matter. It didn't really tie together at all. It was all over the place and one event didn't really lead to the next. She was a very weak woman and I didn't like that at all.
4,Red Dog,A very good family movie. I enjoyed it very much. It was one with a happy ending for a change.
3,Good but not the best of this type.,"Red Dog is an interesting movie and you will need a tissue at the end. However, I enjoyed another movie of this type much more -Hachi: A Dog's Tale.Both movies are about loyal dogs and both are based on true stories. I would definitely enjoy seeing more movies of this type."
2,everything PLUS the kitchen sink,"this book, while sometimes interesting, seems like a warmed-over (or even EXPANDED) doctoral thesis. way too much information is put forward which tends to confuse the reader. needs editing in order to bring clarity to the material. just because someone knows something doesnt necessarily mean it has to be included in the book. surely the author will write other books. saving something for them may be a good thing."
2,Slow lifting,"Just finished installing the actuator on a new Polaris 850. It just barely lifts the plow. It did struggle.So ... by using a longer strap that looped through a lower winch pulley and secured back to the plow framethe plow now lifts properly. Half the speed but twice the power.This shows poor engineering that the customer should not have to 'fix'. I recommend using a winch to do theplow lifting. I did so the prior 2 years but kept straightening the (safety)link and having to repair/replacethe link at least 3 times in any snow plowing session. A PIA it were!One method is a bit to much and the other is to little, Don't ya just love such?"
4,so far so good...,"Installs relatively easy, just need to take your time. I have used in in two small snow storms with a 54"" blade, works great!"
1,Disappointed,"This is most likely, the poorest O'Reilly publication in my library. The technical content is sorely lacking. The book's overall content reminds me of the early Internet books of a few years ago designed to get everyone ""up to speed."" Need to move on. Would have liked to seen more on the recent Internet incidents,hacker group activities and law enforcement countermeasures. This book is not only short (240 pages) but certainly doesn't meet the usually high O'Reilly standards with regard to quality and substance. Better choices are ""Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime"" by Mandia and Procise or ""Hacking Exposed"" by Scambrey, McClure, and Kurtz or ""Hacking Attacks Revealed"" by Chirillo."

3,Not the purple Zeros,"In case anyone is as big a fan as I am of the Zeros from the Sunset Strip days when they painted the Whisky A Gogo purple this is a definitely a different band. How confusing. Get a copy of 4,3,2,1 The Zeros by the purple haired glampunks to hear what us mongers loved about them."
1,Baby Gourmet DVD,So did they pay to get this done? I found this same DVD for 9.00 elsewhere. I just wonder if it is the same..............SO i will not buy your product.
4,I really liked it!!!,"My dad bought me the book because I love ABBA. I have about 15 of their CDs! Anyway, I loved the book because it had lots of pictures of ABBA, and information about the certain time period of ABBA that they give you. One tiny little thing was that the information of ABBA started at year 1979-1982 because that was the time they were most popular and most active. They didn't give information about when they started and so on. But that didn't really bother me. Also, they told about each ABBA member after ABBA. So if you are looking for a good ABBA book, I reccommend this book!"
3,please give the track list!!!!!,"i wont to buy this cd if it is live ??? but i don""t know. so please give the track list."

5,P.S.D is the future,"P.S.D is mad ill. I first heard him back in the seventh grade on the rompilation album. Swear it was the hottest album in school (Franklin Jr. High haha). I later heard premeditated murder and I totally felt that song. High school hits in the 10th grade and everybody is talking about, ""what it is what it is"" that dropped and was sold out at the warehouse. :0( His voice is clean, his methophors are ill, lyrics are real and his swagger is nasty!Yeeeaaaaaaaaahhh! This is the classic."
3,Early Italian String Music,"I ordered this music planning to use it for a slide show of one of my trips to Italy, as well as Switzerland and Austria. It worked out very, very well, was great fun and very entertaining to listen to the older music."
3,More Like Publisher's Call,"I got the impression that Mr. Riker has a committment to the publisher for ""X"" amount of books and this one was just a filler until he could write something else. As much as I admire what the SEALS did in Vietnam, enough already, this is getting repetitive. I'm sure that the SEAL teams have been involved in other actions since Vietnam, and I believe that now is the time to start to write about them.As far as the whole Tangretti/Richardson/Veronica thing, enough already! If I wanted to read a soap opera or bodic ripper, I would. I also find myself tired of the whole Steve Tangretti mental gymnastics that are used to ""justify"" his various daliances throughout the series. If I want to read about this sort of thing I'm sure there are several books available in the marraige section of Amazon. Stick to the main story, leave out the breast beating already.I await the next book in the series, if it looks to be more of the same, then so much for Mr. Riker and the SEAL series."
4,Good read but not the best,"I liked this book despite the mistakes that were made in the writing. One of the obvious mistakes is the change in name of Dave Coffer to Paul Coffer. The other mistake that I can think of is in the beginning when Gunn's team is being picked up by the sub. 12 knots is not a slow speed, once can water ski at 12 knots. Maybe Mr. Riker meant 1 knot or 2 knots but mistyped. Otherwise, I liked this book. I like how we got to see more of the Vietnamese characters in this book and learn more of what drove some of them to fight."
5,H Jay Riker did it again,"If your a new comer or faithful reader of SEAL WARIOR BREED this is a must read. The book is fast paced,even though he tends to repeat himself a little too much.As with his previuos books he continues the legacy of STEVE TANGRETTI in Veitnam. I don't want to give to much of the book away,just be prepared once you start reading you won't stop till the end."
3,NO ONE WINS IN THIS GAME,"I've never fully understood the attraction of the ""Truth or Dare"" game since choosing either optio is intended to place its participants in embarrasing situations.TRUTH OR DIE uses this game as a catapult for a story of revenge enacted upon a group of young college students. This retribution comes at the hands of the brother of a shy, diffident student who suffered humiliation from the students at a Christmas party and commits suicide. Under the pretense of a party, brother Justin invites the abusive students to exact his revenge.There are parts of the film that were involving and intriguing but the film's conclusion is a little muddled and confusing.David Oakes (THE BORGIAS) leads a cast of young newcomers who fare well on the most part. The movie has some sluggish parts that hamper the suspense, but this is not your typical slasher flick.Overall, a moderately entertaining diversion worth a rental."
2,Important book...badly written,"This book is a very important counter argument to the Sonderweg thesis and should be read by anyone wishing to understand why Germany ended up with a leader like Hitler.However, while this book is incredibly important it's just unreadable. The authors use evidence and other information from the English and French revolutions to back up their point and sometimes its difficult for the reader to grasp if this book is about Germany or France and England. This book should be classified as one of the ""really bad books"" that despite being absolutely a wretched read is important for a historian to have on their shelf."
1,Good Luck,"This book was terrible. The writing was simply dreadful and is not conducive to understanding the author's thesis. Good luck to anyone who has to read this for class, you are going to need it."
5,great gift,daughter loved it blah blah blah blahb aldhfodnm fosndeijgf osiddbf osidf osbf osidn osidjf osidj f osidj f osidjf osidf
3,Good for general knowledge,"This book is good for general knowledge of dance therapy, it provides pretty good examples of mind-body relation in a form of case studies. Though this book lacks detail of the therapy session, methods used, group dynamics, etc. If you are looking for a real detail and structured explanation, look somewhere else."
4,Excellent Book!!!!!,Minion By L.A. Banks is an excellent book!!!! When I read the first chapter I was hooked. It is so great to have a vampire huntress who is African American and who has a very diverse guardain team. The book is exciting from beginning to end and will have the reader begging for more.
4,Super Reader,"This is a little like a cross between Guy N. Smith's Sabat, and Angel. A hip, urban vampire sort of thing, with gangsters and nightclubs etc.The woman in question is a Neteru, a superhuman with a mission : fanger-finishing off. She has a crew to help that know about her, an old almost-boyfriend that becomes involve with the vampire rulers and will become bait, and some good monster hunting scenes.While the cover etc. seems to fit it into the whole romance thing, that isn't that large an element, any more than a detective book or thriller with a female lead, really.Some of it might be a touch clunky on setup, particularly some of the crew trying to be cool, but as a quick action book, nothing wrong with this, and I wouldn't be averse to looking at others."
3,Okay You Have Me Hooked,"The Minion, what can I say? Good book to begin a series with! I feel that at times L.A Banks stayed on one topic for way toooooooo long and wanted me to put the book down. I could understand if at the end of her writing tangent on the one topic the characters had a HUGE epiphany that required all the extra wording to really get the point across, but it didn't. Other than the over talking and over explanations and it was an excellent start to a series."
3,Slow start...,It's OK...This book started off slow but then picked up a bit in the middle. Not sure if it picked up enough to keep me reading though.
3,Slow start but getting good,"Took me forever to read this book, but once I did it was ok .It will pass the time until suzanne myers new book comes out ."
3,Great concept...weak backbone!,This had a bit of a slow start for me but by 150 I was caught. Extremely interesting story concept though I think the actual story and its characters lacked feeling and meat. You don't get their stories until close to the end and then you enthralled in the book because of it and it is abruptly over. Yeah I am going to read book 2 in hope that it will get better though.
1,Horrible writing,"The idea of the book is a good one, we always love a good strong female vampire hunter (thanks Buffy), but the author did a horrendous job writing it. It had way too much boring dialog and long descriptions and not enough action. The action scenes that it did have got you hyped up but in the end it didn't pay off. I found myself skimming over all the dialog just to get to the good parts. I don't think I missed much. Let's just say I won't be reading the next book."
1,I don't get the hype,"This book was dreadful. Truly wretched writing, flimsy plot and characters. If reading about ""ghetto"" vampires is your thing, here it is. I don't understand the hype."
1,"Poorly written, poorly editted","I made it through three and a half agonizing chapters of this book before having to put it down. The author's sentences are often clunky, and his/her themes are poorly expressed and frequently repetitive. The one action scene I read had just about every cliched action line, except perhaps ""Lock and load."" What finally got me to put it down was the author's (and editor's) seeming ignorance of basic parts of speech--and no, this is not an issue with slang."
3,Too little for too much..............,"At [this price], this book should have INCLUDED the whole story. I will wait until the sequel hits the used book market on Amazon or Half.com."
1,HORRIBLE book,"I saw this one next to some books I love by Kim Harrison, and Laurell K. Hamilton, and it looked rather interesting. But then I started reading it. It was HORRID! The person who wrote this had to be a religious fanatic. I mean, there is a scene where they are QUOTING SCRIPTURE from the bible to ward off vamipre bats..or whatever they were. *BIG eye roll* I couldnt even get through the 2nd chapter of this book. I had to take it back, It was just too nauseating. And it kept jumping around in time. Maybe later in the book she would have explained herself, but I thought it was a poor way to start out a novel."
1,Just so you know....,"The characters talk in street slang (keeping it pc). I don't like hearing english spoken like that much less reading it. Examples would be sho'nuff, true dat and Ask is spelled A-S-K not a'kin (or however it is spelled in the book) but you get the idea.Also, this is more than a tad religious for me. A gang of hunters going through the alley saying the Lord's Prayer. Also, not anything I like reading about nor do I like combined with my vampire novels.So, if neither of the above things bother you, then you might like it. I didn't, I don't, and I won't be reading any further in the series."
1,I Paid For This? Shoot me.,"I can see now why our library doesn't carry this series, it is ""god-awful"". I sloughed my way through 150 pages of this before tossing it in the garbage. I was sorely tempted to send it back to the publisher with a note, ""Did you actually read this before publishing it?""The dialogue is erractic, the prose nonexistent, and the characters so thin and carboard it's hard to say they even have two dimensions.I've read some of the other reviews and they hit the nail on the head: it's bad, bad, bad, bad.If you rarely read, were born in the ghetto, and never finished elementary school, then this book is for you. Otherwise, don't look twice at the fancy artwork on the cover, it is the best thing about this farce posing as a novel."
1,BORING,"I couldn't even get through 3 chapters! The dialogue is awfully contrived and the story is just BORING! This is only the fifth book that I have not been able finish in my 30 some years of non-stop reading. Trust me it's plain awful! The only new feature is that it is trying to introduce us to an african-american vampire huntress, (but, hey didn't Buffy do that already too?). Anyhow, the language and dialogue was like labor pains, maybe I'm just to old?"
2,Blah Blah Blah,"I'll keep this short and sweet... I would not recommend this book for a few reasons: 1)The book didn't go anywhere-there was no ending or resolution and no cliff-hanger. 2)This book completely lacked excitement, suspense, energy. It was basic writing with a single story line, no twists, no tangents. I didn't care about the story or the characters. That's all folks. Don't let the pretty cover fool you into thinking there is a cool story underneath it's surface."
1,"Annoying dialogue, unlikable characters","I purchased this novel in the hopes of finding a replacement for the slipping Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series. Unfortunately, I found this series utterly disappointing.I found the plot to be unsurprising and highly telegraphed. I did not ""bond"" with the characters at all. In fact, I found them to be highly unlikable in most instances. And as for the dialogue...Ms. Banks needs to realize that slang is like dialect: a tiny bit goes a very long way.In the end, I found this novel to be unreadable. I could not even finish it. It is also one of the few novels that I have ever thrown in the garbage rather than donating to a library. I wouldn't willingly inflict this novel on anyone!"
1,I liked the idea....,"I really did like the idea of the book it just failed miserably to meet the expectations i had for it... I was looking for something to read between Anita Blake books and i found this book, the idea sounded wonderful and i was hoping that i had found another good vampire series, but it was less then great... It had potential, but it needed a lot more work before it went to print."
1,Interesting plot but poor writing,"I choked this book down in about 4 days and let me tell you, it was a rough and grueling stretch of time...The plot of Minion seemed to be pretty interesting at first, maybe not unique and original, but interesting none the less... Yet, every time I began to fall into the plot I was bombarded by the worst and corniest dialogue I have ever read in any book anywhere.I just could not get past how utterly awful the writing was. I flat out laughed at most of the dialogue. I just couldn't take the book seriously.According to the ""About the Author"" info at the back of the book, L. A. Banks attended the University of Pennsylvania. If U Penn produces writers like this, then I have to steer clear of `em from here on out.Poor poor poor."
2,Annoyed,"Annoyed. The book didn't get interesting until halfway, then ends in a cliff hanger. I read the reviews for the next two books and have come to the conclusion that the first three books should have been one. Don'tmind spending the $8 that amazon charges for each book, but hate that I feel like I'm being forced to pay $24 for three stories that could have been told in one."
5,Minion,"I got this book becauce I am in a book club, and I needed something good to read and I found it. Thank you"
1,tiresome,"Tiresome, tedious, overblown, pretentious, poorly written, not worth the price. Save yourself a lot of irksomely wasted time and skip this book.Correction - skip this author. The other books are worse."
3,Fairly interesting,"I have a thing for a good vampire novel, so I thought I would go ahead and start this series, the book has been sitting on the shelf for some time...and I now know why I was hesitant to start lol. This book is a pretty good ""set up"" book. I didn't find it that hard to read, but it was a bit slow..until the end. I hope that the other readers are correct when they say that the second book is far better and maybe...if we are lucky..it gets better with each book. Worth the read, but don't expect to finish in one sitting."
3,Slow but good,"At first read, it's slow going because you have to get used to the way the author writes and how the characters talk. But once you're past that stage, it's good reading from there on out. This first book in the Vampire Huntress series is more to show you what Damali's world is like and how her role as this milennium's chosen one affects her and those around her. Overall this isn't the best book in the series, but it's worth the read so that you know what's going on as you read the others."
3,Lots of Potential,This novel has a decent premise and interesting characters. It does however leave you hanging entirely at the end. I think a re-write in the future could make this a 5 star novel but as it stands this is an entertaining read in need of better editing.
4,A good start!,"It's about time we had a sister-buffy! .. I am a vampire book lover and it was great to walk into a book store and see an African-Amerian Vampire book, by an African American. I read this book and though it started off slow, when I finished it, I couldn't wait for part II. I just bought the 2nd book, and started reading it last night ---- and it's goooooood! Can't wait to see what happens w/ Carlos and Damali!"
1,Disappointed,"I have to say I'm pretty disappointed so far with this book. I've gotten about 75 pages in and honestly don't know if I can go any farther. The slang is making the novel very hard for me to read, not that I don't understand it, I just don't like it. I'm finding that it's hard to follow the third person narrative, half the time I'm not sure whose thoughts are being written or what the heck is going on. The way this writer writes it's very hard to follow where she's going sometimes. I'm a huge fan of vampire novels and really thought these were going to be awesome. L.A. Banks so far doesn't hold a candle to Charlaine Harris, Richelle Mead or Stephanie Meyer. I may try to get through this book in hopes that it will be better or I may just put it down and move on to something else."
1,letdown,"An utter disappointment. The writing was atrocious, the dialogue was horrible and the plot was a cliché done too many times. I didn't get past page 27. I tried to enjoy it, but I realized it was not only a waste of my money, time but also paper."
4,Great Vampire Story!,"I am disappointed to see some negative reviews, because I thought this story ROCKED! I like how all of the characters are developed with distinct personalities. She is such a vivid writer I could actually see the action. My only compliant is the cliff hanger ending. I like it when a sotry is contained within itself. This first novel did not have resolution. I think it was a cheap way to ensure people read the second novel. I would have read it anyway.If you like vampire novels, you'll like this one. Damilia is a kick-butt huntress, and much edger than Buffy or Anita Blake. Try it and you'll get hooked. There are two more novels after this one."
1,What a waste of money!,"This book tries to be a hard-edged Buffy the Vampire Slayer and fails miserably. The action scenes are confusing and poorly written. The combat descriptions are lackluster. The characters are so one dimensional that at times I found it difficult to differentiate between them. On top of that the book is far from original. From replacing the terms Slayer with Neteru and Watcher with Guardian the only thing original about this book is the cover. If you enjoy Buffy, vampires, or well developed character-driven stores I recommend you skip this book. I wish I had. Instead, I will be selling it to my local used bookstore so some other poor devil can be bored to tears by it."
5,WATCH OUT,This book is a HIT! The book was a quick read could not put it down all the charaters even the dark one was so real I love the way the book starts out and how she left you hanging waiting for more at the end. Again a most read and if you Love Buffy this is way way better and I hope it is turned in to a movie and L.A Banks writes the screen play
2,seriously? why is this series so popular?,"I gave this book two stars and not one star because I actually finished it, and there were some (very few) parts that were actually pretty cool. I love the way this author described in detail the vampires, or whatever they were. The descriptions are great, and really scary. But the dialogue in this book are beyond rediculous. It was laughable some of the words and phrases she used... about wanting something like a crackhead wants crack. I tried to find the exact phrase, but I really don't feel like flipping through the book anymore. I mean, it's okay to use street language in dialogue, but why would she use it in the actual narration? All the apostrophes were getting confusing, yo'. Anyway, I will be reading the next book in the series, and I am hoping the author grew up a little in her vocabulary. There has got to be something to a series that lasts as long has this one has. Otherwise, why would she keep writing it? Right?"
4,Good start of a series,If you can get over the use of Slang you will love this book. I love LA Banks world and her characters I fell in love with the story and the potential.
3,It Gets Better,"I've read all 5 of the novels in this series, but the Minion was the weakest story. Overall Minion was interesting, but a little wordy. Banks takes her time in all of the novels to provide background information on all of the main characters, which enriches the entire tale. It's an epic story and though I give Minion 3 stars, the other books are 4 and 5 stars & worth reading. Check out the author's website for further insight into the characters and the Vampire Huntress legend."
2,Very Frustrating.,"This book may as well have ended in mid-sentence. It was very frustrating to have the book end without any feeling of conclusion whatsoever! It ends with a cliffhanger and left me feeling snubbed for paying full price for a book that I only read half of-- at trade paperback price, no less!In favor of the book, the author's characterizations are good and her setting is rich in its mythology. The story is fast-paced, intruiging and compelling. I liked the story very much, but I would not have purchased the book without its sequal if I had known how little of the whole story I would be getting for the price."
3,Just OK!,"This is a new genre for me so I can not be too critical of this book. Although I understand that this book serves as the catalyst for the series, the book was dry. I think Ms. Banks did a good job in describing the background of the characters and the story. She was very thorough and I will even dare to say she was too thorough. At times I FELT like skipping certain sections when Ms. Bank went on and on. I can gladly report I didn't skip any sections and I read the entire book. According to the reviews the second book should be better than the first book in the series. I hope so."
4,introduction to a great series,"Ok, this book isn't the best but once you read The Awakening it all starts to pick up. Looking back this book is more of an introduction to the characters and how they all came together to be a family. We also get the introduction to Carlos. The second book picks up and is a fantastic read but i do suggest you read this granted it is a slow start but it will fill in any blanks for book 2."
1,Do Vampires Have A Pulse?,"I really don't know whether or not vampires have a pulse but, what I DO know is... THIS BOOK DOESN'T! Damali, the vampire slayer, and her slaying friends spent more time sitting around talking than going out and doing any slaying! I kept waiting for this book to kick into high gear but it never got out of first gear. I realize that this is a trilogy but the ending was way too abrupt and, after reading an excerpt from book #2 in this series, I'll definitely pass on it and on book #3."
2,Disappointing,"Based on the good reviews this book received, I kept reading long after I would normally quit. But after awhile, enough was enough and I stopped reading. There are just too many other books out there to waste time with this one. The characters weren't interesting, the story didn't go anywhere, and the dialog was stilted and/or did nothing to advance the plot. If you like vampire stories, or just good writing in general, don't waste your time with this one."
1,terrible,"I could not get pass the first 40 pages. The author uses slang words always. What I mean is, not only in dialogue, but even in normal discriptions and narratives. I was having to read the same paragraph, chapter, everything, over and over just to picture what was happening in the story, and still did not have a clue what the narrator was speaking about.Very poor writting."
2,I wanted to like this novel...,"...but I didn't get past page 40. I found the cliched, 90's slang horribly annoying. Seriously, what self-respecting black person would say 'da bomb' and 'all that'? I almost threw the book across the room, but unfortunately trudged on to the 20+ pages where the characters sit around and discuss how ""odd"" they feel..the author was trying to build a sense of tension, but failed miserably, since at that point the reader is pleading for something--ANYTHING--to happen. And when something finally does happen, it's a huge letdown...since the situation didn't seem that dire to begin with, and the author does not know how to write a good fight scene....example ""He kickboxed it into a corner."" I mean c'mon. I gave this book 2 stars instead of one, because it's not the worst thing I've read (I believe the later Anita Blake books take that dubious honor) but get it at the library, and save your money."
2,Cliffhanger ending isn't enough to get me to keep reading,"I picked up the freebie booklet detailing the background and history behind the Vampire Huntress legends this series revolves around; reading that made me really excited to get into this series. Unfortunately, this book just couldn't keep me interested. None of the characters have any real substance, and you expect to be able to knock them flat with a stiff breeze. The characters are from a very specific ethnic background and the dialogue very strongly reflects that; if you can't handle improper English, and lots of slang, these aren't the books for you.The story itself is very slow-moving and not very memorable. The main character is stubborn and not particularly engaging, and the erotic scenes are awkward. Despite the fact that this book ends in a cliffhanger, it wasn't good enough to get me to keep reading the series to see if it got any better. In fact, I returned the book, anticipating that I'd never want to read it again."
1,I can't believe I wasted my money on this.,"As a fan of the Laurell K. Hamilton Anita Blake series, I picked up this book in hopes it'd have the same genius of the early books in the Anita series.Boy was I dead wrong.After the first 25 or so pages, I set the book down and haven't touched it since. The writing is absolutely atrocious and the pretense of the story is ridiculous. A rock star recording artist VAMPIRE HUNTER. That's just as farfetched as being a brain surgeon astronaut who lives on Mars.Don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,Don't waste your money,This was such a disaapointment. I loved the premise but the characters were so unlikable I couldn't finish the book. I love vamp/were stories but this was unreadable. There are much better books out there in this genre.
1,Dont waste your time!!!!,"This book is nothing more than a rip off of Buffy and Anita Blake, only set in the ghetto. While I thought it would be refreshing to read a vampire novel with a more ethnic feal, this book sits in the dredges of humanity and revels in stereotypical characters and poor writing. Don't waist your time."
1,Buffy knock off,"I'll keep this short and to the point. This book is nothing more than a Buffy knockoff. A very bad Buffy knock off. As another reviewer stated, ""Buffy in the Hood"" with really bad writing. I got tired of always reading about the characters giving each other a pound on the fist...like they did on page 9, page 15...page 35. Oh and again on page 50. Then on page 60. And yet again on page 103. Don't forget the fist pounding on page 169 and 209. I could go on but I think you get the idea. Fist pounding ad nauseum."
3,Where's the second half?,"Where is the second half of the book? Just when I was getting into the story and the climax looms, the book is over. Oops, go out and buy book two. The only saving grace is a preview for the sequel that answers enough questions to let you draw your own conclusions. I probaby won't buy the second one on the priciple of the thing. When you write a book, write the whole thing, don't force your readers to buy the next one."
2,Very basic stuff and NO PIZAZZ at all...,"I was very disappointed with this book. I am a speaker and this book will not help me much. The basic message of the book: the audience must be involved so it learns. No kidding!?This book was ""presenting with pizazz"" and NOT ""tricks to become a better trainer""!!! The title is completely misleading, since I didn't learn how to add any creativity, showbiz or ""pizazz"" to my presentations!In fact, being known for my surprising presentations, I will really think about writing this book myself, as it was meant to be.I do not recommend this book since it contains only minimal content."
4,"Oh, what a crazy ride!","I came across Namedropper this summer and gobbled it up. I read it in literally less than 24 hours, and when I finished it, I was upset because my adventures with Viva were over. Forrest, as a young writer, was able to successfully capture the voice of a confused, eccentric teenager in the 1990s. Although many of the pop culture references were obviously based on the Brit Pop rock scene (Oasis, PLacebo, Blur) circa 1994-1995, the characters and situations took on a life of their own. In addition, I admire the fact that Forrest does not end her tale on a happy note. Viva exits confused and unsure of herself and her future, but oh what a crazy ride she's had. This book has become a favorite for me: I've passed it on to friends, I re-read it when I'm feeling sad and I turn to Emma Forrest when I want to escape to a rock fantasy world which, I must admit, is very often."
1,"honestly, junk.","There are a couple ways for a book to be bad. Some books are fun to read candy. They don't take a lot of work and you can pretty much start reading them at any page and even if they are a cliche ridden and bubbleheaded, it doesn't matter. Other books are so God-awful bad that you find yourself thinking about all the other books in the universe and why this one if sucking away your life like this. Then you find yourself staring at the author photo wishing you could make them bleed.This book is of the latter. Not that it is even really fair to call it a 'novel,' since usually novels have characters that are interesting and develop over time while following some thread literary types call a 'plot.' This is more like a note captured by a teacher during and extremely dry biology lecture, written by a sloe-eyed naif whose perceived depth is entirely due to her fashion sense.Please, just put the book down and walk away slowly. Don't run, you will only provoke it."
5,Prodigious,"This is the IT read of the season, but don't let that stop you, or be the reason you read it. A hip, dishy novel, it is much more profound and thoughtful than the early reviews suggest. The breezy style might remind some of Nick Hornby, but this is a richer, more layered, more multidimensional novel, funny with genuine poignancy. The author is 23, the book was published in the Uk when she was 22, which means she wrote it when she was around 20, but it has none of the self-conscious hipness or mawkishness of most young novelists. SVH"
5,Worth every penny!,"I bought this to keep my cat from getting under foot or getting loose while I was moving and it worked perfectly. I put it out with the doors open a few times beforehand just so she could get used to it and I knew we were going to be okay because she spent a lot of time playing in it. On moving day, I put her in this with toys, her bed, food and water and since she could see everything that was going on as we carried things in and out, she was content. This has also come in handy for sitting out in the yard and on our balcony. My cat is able to enjoy some fresh air and I'm able to enjoy knowing that she can't get into trouble. She'll occasionally claw at the sides--mainly if I'm out of sight for more than a few seconds--but her claws don't get stuck and it doesn't cause any damage. I wouldn't leave any animal unsupervised in this (especially mine, since she knows how to work zippers), but this is a really great way of keeping your pet safe both indoors and out."
1,Can not get it to re-fold.,I bought this so our cat could enjoy the outdoors safely while we camp in our RV. I've NEVER been able to get it refolded. I called customer support and was told the wire probably got bent the first time I tried to close it. I've watched the video on folding it over and over again. I've tried folding it until my hands are sore. Very disappointed in the product and customer service.
3,Two cat visits and it already has a tear in it,"Am acclimating my two cats (litter mates) by exposing them gradually to the funhouse, both inside and out. I keep their nails trimmed, yet one has already torn a hole in the netting. The seller's assertion that it is sturdy and ""stands up to claws"" is not holding true for my felines. Somewhat disappointing for the price, therefore. I so wanted this to be perfect."
3,Read this!,"The tent is really spacious and of *good quality. However, I have two problems with it. The bottom is made of netting also and doesn't keep what's on the ground off of my indoor cat...and most importantly MY CAT OPENED THE ZIPPER AND ESCAPED!!! Luckily, we were still indoors!I highly recommend using small locks for the openings and ALWAYS supervise your cat!"
4,Worth the price,"I ordered this product because my cats love to go outdoors but I worry about them getting hit by a car. They love this product and I like feeling secure that they are safe. It's easy to assemble, although difficult to fold back into the bag. The only complaint I have is that I would prefer for it to be a little bigger so they could run around instead of just sit in it."
3,well designed,"i know most people say that their cats loved thiis....but i think its cuz i have a kitten that immediately when i put her in this, she stops whatever play she was previously doing and acts like shes beng punished...I mainly use this to seperate my adult cat from my kitten because they dont get along so well yet...but this product is really neat, well built and , doesnt tear!"
4,Outdoor safe fun for indoor cats,"After considering the various products on the market, I purchased this one and am very pleased. I live on the second floor of an apartment building and have a back porch with access to a small lawn area. This tent pops up easily and fits nicely on the lawn. I can put my two cats inside and watch them from the porch. I especially like the height of this tent as the kitties can walk around with the tails up without rubbing their head on the roof. The mesh bottom allows afor a little grass to poke through so they can ""graze."" It would be great if the company made a sunshade that attaches...."
3,nice item but my kitty doesn't happen to like it!,"Before buying, I saw the photos of cats sitting inside their funhouses, calmly surveying their surroundings. Well, my cat is on the younger side (about 3), and when I put her in the funhouse, she acted like it was a prison. She cried and yowled to get outside the funhouse to explore. So I built a shelf outside a window, put the funhouse on it, and attached the open side of the funhouse to the open window. When the weather is nice, I open the window, and the cat goes out and comes in at will. But I can only use it when I don't have the heat or air conditioner on.The funhouse seems well made and its features are as advertised. Whether it works for you may well depend on your cat's preferences, which are often hard to predict!"
4,"Easy to open, not so easy to fold back","Opened the package, unzipped the bag, took it out, threw it on the ground and it opened itself right up. I looks just like what I thought it would and I know it will work well. Haven't used it yet. Is there a video showing how to fold it back? I tried for about 15 minutes and finally got it back. I have no idea how I did it.....I was trying everything. The written instructions are not adequate."
3,Cat funhouse,"Cats would be better at reviewing this than me but since they don't have fingers, they have asked me to do this. Four cats share two funhouses which sits out front of our house and the cats are safe to be on the lawn, watch the birds at the feeders and enjoy the fresh air. The zippers are perfect for admitting one cat while another might be inside and not always wanting another companion. The set up gets a number of comments from those walkers strolling by and noting the ability of the cats to safely enjoy the outdoors too. Only complaints is my difficulty in getting handy at taking the funhouse tent down but with a little bit of luck, I have found a way to fold the tent up with ease. I could never explain the process to someone but it happens naturally itself as the fold occurs with a slight twist. Money is well spent."
5,Cat loves it!,"I sent this to my stepdaughter, who has an indoor-only cat. She says her cat loves this! Shipping took awhile, but the Funhouse is great!"
5,Must read for baseball lovers of the 1970's!,"Excellent book on the last dynasty in baseball, the 1972-1974 Oakland Atheltics. Exceptionally written, this is well worth the read."
5,How can I comfort someone who is hurting?,"In the Shelter of His Wings: Resting in God's Tender Care is the perfect book to share with a friend, family member or acquaintance who may be going through a physical, spiritual or emotional trial. The words from Scripture and the quotes from men and women who have experienced sorrow and suffering in their lives help provide encouragement to those who may be feeling alone in the midst of their difficult circumstances. The beautiful watercolor illustrations of nature help to transmit the message of comfort and love. It is an easy book to pick up and read in whole or in part as desired. It is a wonderful way to communicate God's love and presence to those who may be seeking this reassurance."
1,sad,"This book arrived today in very bad conditions , it was completely wet and almost destroyed ,there was a not send from my country mailing which say , this order was opened and in bad conditios .I m very sad about it ! this is the first time it happenas yo me ,I really can t believe it !!Patricia"
5,Kodak Digital Camera Batteries...,...are difficult to find in local stores without the charger. Very happy I found them on Amazon. They are well worth the money as the charge lasts a long time in a digital camera taking scores of pictures before having to be recharged. They can be recharged many times before having to discard in an environmentally safe manner.
2,So So,Some hold carges longer than others. I also bought AAA and I need 3 for my device. They only last about 3 hours.
2,Good While They Lasted ... but No Charge After 3 Years,"We bought these 3 years ago, and they were great while they lasted. Alas, today they no longer hold a charge. (So much for the urban myth of holding a charge for 1,000 times). Anyway, they were ok for 3 years, and now off to get Sony batteries & charger for $15.00. We are disappointed, however, that the charge lasted only approx 36 times (once/month). 36 <> 1000."
3,Purchased but were not what I needed,"I purchased these batteries so I would always have a back up of charged batteries for events I wanted to catch on film, however, the batteries were not the ones that work with the charger I had. I am not going to buy another charger just to charge these up, because I already have the longer time charger. So I'm stuck with a brand new package that hasn't been opened, and can't return because I waited too long to return them to Amazon."
1,Does not hold charge,"I gave this review 1 star becaause I could not select any lower.This battery is one of the worst that I've come across. It does not hold a charge for more than 15 shots in a Kodak DX series camera. I am using the recommended Kodak charger. I use the sony batteries without any issues. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you have money to throw away!!! Note that I have had the same issue with a previous set of Kodak batteries, but thought they may have been giving problems because I hardly ever use."
5,KODAK NiMH Pack,"A quad package of a better environment.Being able to recharge is vital especially at the very high cost basis.Shopping here does have a great benefit in cost comparison as well reviews. Thats why I think, we all look in here and shop.The NiMH batteries do not have a memory so that is another advantage. NiCAD's do.Kodak I think does charge a premium for its name and private lable on the products. But what do people expect? Getting a quality package of a product but paying for less..."
4,Kodak rechargeable digital camera batteries,"great batteries, recharges at reasonable time frame, a real plus while traveling, bring a charger and you can recharge at any hotel, plus a reasonable cost for this product compared to others"
1,Kodak Max 2500 Rechargeable Batteries are the WORST!,"The Kodak Max 4 2500 rechargeable batteries are the WORST I've ever used. I usually get the Kodak 2100's and they are great. I can take hundreds of pictures with just 1/4 battery use. With the 2500's (which I got free with a charger I bought), I take 9 pictures in my Kodak Easy Share camera on a full charge and it says ""battery low"". (And, this, with the picture size set to the smallest I can make it in the camera!) With the 2100's, I can take hundreds of pics, review them, crop them and I'm still good to go for more. Sorry ... but if this battery is supposed to be ""MAX"" and a better battery, it's not. The only thing that makes it ""MAX"" is the price. I don't know how it is in other electronics, but I would think that they would AT LEAST work well in a Kodak camera! But, sadly, they don't."
1,Kodak batteries,"I recently bought 7 packages of these battereis. I have used them for years, however I am very unhappy with the lastest batch. They will not take a charge right out of the package!"
4,Little Known West Coast Rap History,"If you're looking for a pretty definitive sound of the West Coast in the late 90s (especially the Bay/Hilltop area), this is a good album to listen to. It features a couple major acts as well as some local one-hit wonders. Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, Dru Down, Rappin 4-Tay (remember him?!) and even Rodney O (of Rodney O and Joe Cooly, another real old west coast group) make cameos. The album came out in '97 and faded into obscurity, but it'll remind you of how the West once was.While this album was out, the east coast was doing it's thing with their definitive 'boom-boom-bap' beat tracks and DJ mix tapes first coming out, the midwest was still trying to get on the hip hop map, and the only rappers making it out of the south were booty bass groups and Outkast."
3,"Offers some useful ideas, but not practical for low-income schools","While Betty Boult does offer some excellent ideas; this books seems to target parent populations made up of primarily middle to upper-class professional parents (such as websites for parents & offering student word-processing services for hire). It might be useful for some schools, however it was not appropriate for the population that I serve as an inner-city school social worker."
3,Please note-not the classic 1975 Denver tv special!,"I got my hopes up when I saw this title and thought it was the old tv special I remembered fondly from the 70s.(The one with Denver in the glass-enclosed dome in the snow.)Further reading revealed it is merely Xmas scenes underscored by the accompanying cd of the same name.Luckily I didn't buy it under false pretences,but I thought others might make the same mistake.However,I may reconsider,as the original record is a tasteful,enjoyable Xmas record and I can imagine snow scenes would go well with the music. Festive albums generally are a pretty awful bunch,and this nice understated LP,with gentle orchestations by Lee Holdridge is one of the better ones.Denver's rendition of 'O Holy Night',done in his lyric,sympathetic tenor,is worth the price of the record alone."
4,Rocky Mountain Christmas,"I still enjoy this collection of songs after all these years. A rather interesting format, songs I would give 5 stars, format 3 stars. Not sure where the confusion came from on what it contained, unless the description has been modified to help describe it better. The cover shown is the same from the original album so at least now you know what you are getting up front. I always read the descriptions before I buy because so many on John Denver's albums available today are just remixes of older albums and you could end up buying the same thing over and over."
1,Hog Wash Item!!!,"I bought this item expecting some parts of John Denvers holiday special with Olivia Newton John. ALL this dvd is is a cheap picture of a fire in a fireplace with a number of songs. No Olivia pictured, no John, just a fireplace and some poor recordings of songs! I'm not even returning this dvd... I'm destroying it, taking the hit! and writing this so no one will be suckered into purchasing it if they print my review!!"
3,"5 star story, 1 star production quality.","After failing to protect Lorelei, Otaru sets out with Hanagata to rescue her from the Gartland kidnappers. The two arrive and disable the Gartland mobile fortress. Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry arrive to help, but Faust has returned to his evil ways. He plans on starting another war. The Saber Dolls are torn between helping their master and doing what they know is right.The story in this DVD gets really good. There is action, suspense, and plenty of drama. My complaint with this 2nd season remains the same. The character designs, voice acting, and detail in this series have been shot to hell. All the characters are ugly and the voice actors suck. If you average the 5 star story and the 1 star production quality, you get 3 stars. I love the Saber Marionette J story and I hate to give it 3 stars, but season 2 doesn't deserve it."
4,Great value,"for the price. This is simply a wonderful resource for the knitter who is looking for great texture- just page through, and pick one! Other stitch dictionaries go for twice as much or more, and have a lot less information."
3,I am not EXCITED about it but will keep it,"I am an avid knitter and have been designing some knitwear the past few years. So I always love to look up different knitting stitches to gain inspiration in my design. Before getting this book, I already have plenty in my shelf and there cannot be too MANY stitch pattern book for me.After I received the book, I briefly browsed through it and honestly, really nothing interest me and I found the graphics in the books are not good. I mean, they definitely could have taken better pictures.For knitters who are sick of simple stockinnete stitch, garter stitch and would like to try something NEW in knitting, you definitely can get this book because it is still helpful and you can't complain with the price either."
4,Big Book of Knitting Stitch Patterns,"This book has a good range of stitches. The row-by-row instructions are excellent. My 2 criticisms are that some of the photographs are taken too close, making it more difficult to see the overall pattern. Also, the many different colours used in the samples can be a bit confusing to the eye. I will probably get quite a bit of use out of this book."
5,Great Resource for Starting a new Agile Project,"As part of my daily job, I lead agile projects in a large organization. I usually use a number of different sources to get the information that I need on different aspects of agile development and leading agile projects. I really like this book for a number of reasons: (1) I like the fact that it is written by a number of respected experts in the area; (2) I like its style in chapters like 5 that summarizes lessons learned in a set of principles; (3) Chapter like 14 clears confusions on topics like ""agile documentation"".I enjoy and benefit from this book and you should find it useful if you are also engaged in leading and managing agile projects."
3,Good for Nostalgia,"Covers the origins of several Marvel classic characters and teams, including the X-Men, Iron Man, The Avengers, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer. Following the reprint of each origin is a reprint of a more recent story involving that character."
5,the best irish fiddling album I've found,"I am so happy I found this album. I've always wanted this cd, before I knew it existed. I love traditional Irish dance music, especially the fiddling. I generally don't like vocals in it though. And although the reels and jigs and hornpipes are all so well known, finding a good cd of them is just so hard (at least for me). [Does every Irish collection really need to have Danny Boy and Whiskey in the Jar?]There isn't a bad song on this release. Thank you to Rounder records for saving these classic songs by some excellent musicians... performances that may have otherwise been forgotten. I hope that more of these older recordings will be made available in the future.If you like Irish music, I'd have to imagine you'll love this cd."
4,Scrub Brush,"Love it, For what I am using it for. I would buy it again, and again. It works great, and cleans well."
4,"Well, scrub my tub......","My bad. From the pic, I thought this was a heavy duty toilet bowl brush. It really is just a long handled tire scrubber so you don't have to bend over so much. They should have shown a side view too. It seems well made, but I sent it back anyway. Shoot...I wuz hopin' it was the toilet model."
2,"damaged in shipping, very poor quality paper","The seller sent this map in a tube, but bent both sideds to fit into a box. Then when I took it out I could see very bend in the paper. It has a lot of detail, but probably won't last real long in our house with little kids. I ordered the Michelin World map and I am very please with the detail, quality, and it is well laminated so should endure a bit longer then this United States Map."
5,Trian Ride,This movie right here is a must see for parents and students going into college away from home. The story line is most definetly believeable. I recommend this to everyone with kids. An those who are running the colleges an Universities. Allows them to see what could be going on in there own back yards. Another Keeper.
5,well done and tasteful for griity drama,"This film could have taken the low road on many occasions but took the high road every time. It's gritty and tough, but tasteful. You don't see that much with films nowadays. The characters' plights are always treated with realness and care. Even the characters who morals are in question are not treated shabilly. The viewer is rightfully left to come up with their own conclusion. This makes for a message that resonates long after it's been seen on the screen. I can always appreciate seeing black characters on screen in three-dimensional and responsible form. Two thumbs up!"
4,Showing our pride,We are able to show our pride in the Chicago Cubs by proudly displaying this product on our mailbox. I have noticed that some of the red has begun to fade. This could be because of the large amount of rain that we have received lately.
5,Great Baby Shower Gift!,This was the gift I brought to a Couples Baby Shower and it was the hit of the evening. I had never been to any kind of a baby shower before. This looks like the right way to include dad's in from the start. I watched the mom-and-dad-to-be share in the excitement and love of their friends. I think this early bonding to the experience will strengthen the family unit. Armin A. Brott and Jennifer Ash are to be congratulated.
2,What a letdown...,"Took me YEARS to find their 2nd release - and the wait was not worth it. Very tepid album overall, with next to nil of the energy level from the self titled release. Peter Dolving wandered off shortly after this to join The Haunted briefly (then quit for 5 years and come back again). If you're into The Haunted and looking for Peter's earlier work, skip this and just pick up 'Mary Beats Jane'"
4,Good,"I've had this phone for nearly a year. The best thing about it is the taking pictures...however, they won't allow you to turn to sound off when taking a picture. Also, when scrolling through your text messages, you aren't allowed to just press the down arrow and continue scrolling.You have to go back to the menu and look at it the list and click on one you would like to see. However, it does have some pretty awesome features."
4,Samsung and Tmobile make a great team!,"WHAT I LIKE MOST:1. excellent reception.2. 65K color sreen is clear, beautifully saturated.3. sound is clear like a bell.4. lots of features5. external LCD screen is very useful in the dark, so is the service light but can be somewhat annoying because of its brightness.6. high quality built, no squeezing between clamshell7. light-weight, much better than Motorola phone.8. perfectly compatible with Asia's 900Mhz network. All you have to do is call Tmobile or look up instruction codes to unlock the phone. With ATT phones, even they are tri- or quad-band, you're out of luck.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:1. short list of wallpapers and ringtones.2. the battery is not as strong as E-316. Charge it nightly at bedtime will solve the problem.3. where's bluetooth technology in this 300 dollars phone?4. ear-microphone jack is covered by plastic cap. This design is out-dated."
3,Looks: Excellent; Functions: Average; Logic: Poor,"It's is very pretty looking phone with good camera and voice features BUT programming logic used is very poor. Like - the calls log history will list your wife's id 'WIFE' 10 times if she called you 10 times. It will not tell you if she called from home, mobile or office!! You see it is a pain to search for a number to call back if you want to call at a different number. You have to open and see every call in the log's history to find if it is the number that you are looking for."
2,Samsung Offers No Service,"I recently purchased the Samsung e715 cell phone. I was very impressed with the size, flip phone features and camera features. The phone did not hold a charge properly and dropped calls at will. T-Mobile referred me to Samsung and after several attempts over a few weeks I gave up on getting through to anyone at Samsung. T-Mobile finally sent me a new battery which did not help, so they have replaced the phone. The service is not great in some areas, and according to T-Mobile that may be due to the internal attennae. The phone also gets quite warm very quickly when in use. Not my best purchase...."
2,"...have nothing bad to say, but also nothing good","Phone is really cool...got a camera and a flashlight along with some disco lights. This phone is great in all of its functions other than actually being a phone. Reception is horrible, calls get dropped all over the place, service dissapears as soon as you enter into a building. But when you do get a call, you get a cool jingle and a nice light show. As much as I want to like this phone for how cool it is, I can't. This phone is really bad...definitely not worth the price, or even half of its price for that matter. I came over from Sprint because I didn't want to sign a 2 year contract. I would gladly do so now."
2,E715,E715 is cool looking phone. But the truth is that it's screen life is pathetic. I need to get it repaired within a year luckily it was in warranty period. But to my irony the samsung fixed it and the screen went off again after 2 months of repair. so guys be carefull you will not be able to use this phone more than a year.
3,Good phone with some issues,"Easy to use phone with good sound and ok picture quality (better than Nokia), and the phone looks great! Issues: Battery life is weak. In contrast to the E105 you cannot adjust the brightness of the display which would help you save some power; Internatioal use: I travelled to Thailand and could not use my phone in 90% of the time while all the tri-bands around me were working. With the 900/1900 MHZ dual band solution you have no guarantee that the phone will work seamlessly in all international networks. If this is a must take a triband. Also: Screen is hard to read in the sunlight."
2,Good for one year,"I've had the phone for over one year. Everything was fine.Now, the screen got bad and of course I am out of the warranty period. It is a known problem but they don't want to do anything since it's been over one year.Buy something else."
4,Not as satisfied...,"I currently own this phone but it is not as satisfying as I thought it would be. There were many reasons why I purchased this phone:1. Camera Phone* Flash* Zoom in/Zoom out* Photo frames2. Flip Phone3. Samsung4. T-mobileAfter I purchsed this phone I did not find it as compatible as I thought it would be. First, if I receive a missed call, it would not display on the LCD window, it would just flash flash and flash.* Cannot take video clips like some of the Nokia phones could.* Not sure what the voice memo is really for because you cannot set it as an alarm.* If you set the phone alert as vibration/melody... it vibrates three times and rings... kind of pointless if it does not vibrate the whole time.Pros:* There are many ringtones and wallpaper you can choose from.* Small and slim* Take pictures in different color schemes.* Customize your own style... set the menu as bar page/one item per page... service light... LCD window..."
2,Recurring screen problems plague this phone...,"I have had to return my E-715 twice because it appears randomly the screen gets horizontal bleaching patterns across the screen. Dont believe me? Do a Google search on ""e-715 screen lines"".Of course T-Mobile and Samsung both tell you that you're crazy and that you're the only person who has experienced this problem.Otherwise the features on the phone are great, the IR port is great to sync to your computer, and the LED light you can use as a flashlight is the best feature on the phone."
5,Excellent Phone,"The new Samsung E715 is an excellent phone. It has great features, such as a Camera, games (golf is the best), downloadable ringtones and browsing abilities, a color display, picture messaging, and a powerful organizer. The battery life is not extensive, but that shouldn't be an issue for most cell phone users. Honestly, it's quite simple: charge the phone every night and you'll be FINE, and you can even throw it on a charger at the office so that you ALWAYS have a full battery. The phone is powerful and sleek, and excellent combination."
5,Best cell phone ever!,"It currently has the best quality in camera, tft-lcd pannel screen, and the first OLED in the world. It has flash on it so that you can take pictures in darkness with incredible digital zoom. The voice quality is much better than i thought and i believe it is better than other competing models from other company. I believe those who don't have good reception is mainly because of the area you live don't provide good reception from T-mobile. The spec shows the best quality among cell phone and it really is!"
1,worst site ever,"This is the worst site ever. I brought a phone from here and paid for 2 days shipping and this is the 5 day. It still hasn't been shipped yet. I ordered the samsung e715 too. They won't let me cancel or anything. No one to call for question. This company is bogus. I tried to cancel it but the website just gave me the run around. There's no customer service to call if I have questions. In my opinion, avoid buying from this site at all cost. If you have problems there is no one here to help you."
1,THE CHULING,"I BUT THE PHONE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO SO FAR I LIKE THE PHONE HOW EVER I HAVENT DISCOVER ALL THE FITURES BUT I BELIEVE I DOSENT HAVE A VOICE CALL WERE YOU SD THE NAME AND IT DIALS THE PHONE,AND AS WELL I BELIEVE THE CAMERA THE FLASH AND QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS I TOD WILL BE,BUT IS A VERY NICE PHONE WITH NICE FITURES PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT SO FAR"
4,"Small, lightweight, very few concerns","No speakerphone, no individual caller ringtone (you have to put a name in as a group for a ringtone to that name). The home charger cord to the phone has died twice. You'll end up purchasing one or getting T-Mo to credit your account for a new one. Other then these few concerns... the phone is top-notch. Excellent reception... gorgeous resolution...great camera capabilities."
2,battery life is not as good as the claim,"The manufacturer's specs say 300 hours of standby time.After disabling the flashing to reduce power, the standby time is approximately 100 to 120 hours. Nowhere near the claim.Other than that this is a very impressive phone."
3,I need a change,"I got this phone to replace my earlier Samsung E105. I decided to go for a Samsung since I was really please with the E105, but the E715 is not as good1) Battery life is not as good (maybe because the LCD panel in the 105 was replaced with a LED panel to make it prettier)2) Reception is bad - I get just one bar or none when its overcast.On the brighter side:1) Small and light2) Looks great"
1,Worst service center of samsung,"I bought the samsung cell phone E715 six months back from amazon site and it is in warranty period , it stopped working and I send that cell phone to service center , after 10 days I got the unrepaired cellphone. when I called the service center they told me we cannt repair this because of Liquid damage.I told them that it is in warranty period as stated on their website and product , but they decline stating that it is because of my misuse.On site they have mentioned 12 month warranty ."
1,Dont get TMobile,"This is the latest phone I've had with TMobile. I got a contract extension, and I regret it. I have a couple months left until I can switch to a better company. The service with these people is awful. They are rude and dont care if you're satisfied if you have a contract. They get really sweet when your contract is up.There is a reason that Verizon and Cingular are much, much bigger companies. If you're thinking of switching, dont pick TMobile! The initial deals look good, but you'll regret it!"
4,Pros and Cons,"I've had the E715 for almost a year now and like some others, the LCD screen is beginning to fade quite a bit and horizontal lines are pretty evident. Probably will have to take it to a T-Mobile store to check it out since I've heard it's best to take it to the store before sending it back (see reviews for T-Mobile's RAZR). Also really miss the speakerphone feature since this phone comes without it.."
2,Faded Screen,"After I bought my phone in Oct 2004, I started reading reviews complaining the screen failure. It happend to me this morning, after 9 months of usage. It appears that it is not an uncommon problem. Does not look like Samsung has done anything for customers with defected products. I am sure my next phone will not be a Samsung."
3,I agree with all who have problem with the display screen,I got this phone when it first came out after reading all the good review about the phone. After less than a year of use the display screen is fading and I could barely see what is on the screen. Now I see that other people are having the same problem and it not my fault but the malfunction of the phone.
3,Low battery life...!???,Is it just my experience or other owners feeling same .??Just bought 3 days ago...camera resolution is very nice ..Other features looks good so far. BUT battery life seems very low..as of today my talk time used was about 25 minutes avg per day..and it runs low on battery.
4,Good Performance,"When I bought this phone, this was one of the best in the market.Advantages :..Good battery life..internal antenna still the performance is good.. digital camera is quite decent..i have uploaded quite a few pics and they turned out ok.--haven't had any problems so far have been using it for 2 yrs now....it has an external display as well which is gooddrawbacks..if u are msg..then it takes a bit time to change the lettes on the same key..the signal indicator light is little irritation as it flashes quite strongly.tried using it in holland..couldn't that could be coz of network problem"
5,What the heck! some previous reviews were crazy,"This is definitely the best phone ever!Reception? I've never seen such good reception quality!Good design, camera(you can use instead of digital camera 1.0megapix)"
2,just ok,Just bought the Samsung E700 cell phone (doesn't have the flash). A nice phone but .....* its dual band* no voice dialing* no bluetooth* really short battery life (2-3 days with 20 mins talking time / day)taking into consideration its price I'd say its just ok.
4,"I don't have this phone, but have seen it, look very cool","But do you know this phone has a very high radiation? google ""Samsung E715 sar cnet"". it is 1.41, veyr high"
3,this phone rocks but t-mobile suxxx,"i live in Manhattan and when i go to upstate to visit relatives there is no service... im not saying this phone suxx im just saying the carrier (t-Mobile) suuux. dont get me wrong as u can see in the pictures this phone is awesome.... the LCD screen is great, the LCD screen outside is awesome and the picture qualities is fantastic. all im sayin is that t-mobile should expand its services thru upstate new york or im canceling this phone...."
1,Think Twice,"Ok, If you are getting this phone, think twice. Its not what you expect. It does not have any normal features that you would expect from a normal cell phone. This phone is made with the concept of form over function in mind. Very poorly rated among other phones, especially T610. the only good feature is the camera which will become obsolete within 1 month when new phones come out. I purchased the phone and returned it. If you are looking for pure looks, then buy the phone. If you want to actually USE the phone and have some extra features look elsewhere. Good Luck."
1,WTF Samsung !,This is by far the worst phone I've ever owned. I had the Nokia 3650 and I wanted a smaller phone. This phone has virtually no features that my old phone had. I just bought this phone solely on aesthetics and because it had a camera. It doesnt look bad but thats about the only thing it has going for it. The picture quality is awful to say the least and I have to recharge it every 2 days(keep in mind I only talk about 10 mins a day because I hate talking on the phone). Not only that but my sometimes it tweeks and just turns off by itself and deletes numbers from my phone book. Please steer clear from this phone...
3,"Just got mine stolen, sad but not devastated","I loved this phone because of the antenna-less design, but like other reviewers mine started having glitches. If I accidentally let the battery die or turned it off, when I reboot it the screen is completely faded out (way too bright) and has lines through it. Also when you turn it back on after use it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to regain all of its features (phonebook and camera in particular--if I try to use the camera within a few minutes of turning it on, it says ""Please wait"" for a minute and then reboots itself).Even then, I may buy the same phone when I get my replacement because I like its features and its easy to use.Also I'd like to say I have had excellent service from T-Mobile unlike the other reviewer; they have been very helpful when I had issues (and I have had a few with minutes plus my phone just getting stolen). They are also very nice and polite to me even when I was freaking out this morning because I found out my phone was stolen."
2,Poor reception and too delicate,"There is no way to adjust the screen brightness on this phone. My screen is so bright it is impossible to see photos I've stored on the phone, and I cant see numbers in the address book once they're highlighted by the cursor. Forget about trying to use the phone in the sunshine! I have a lot of complaints, but I'll move on to the major one: the reception is terrible! I have always used Nokia phones, and I'll go back. I was just tempted by the gizmos on this phone. I thought a flip phone would be more durable, but it seems so cheeply constructed, and you can still scratch the camera lens by putting it in your pocket, so you might as well get whatever phone you like and just get a case if you care. Frankly I'm just going to chuck this phone. It has made me crazy. On the flip side, when it was new it was pretty cool for a while..."
2,"Nice size, good reception, but poor usability","Pros:- Small size (and definitely the no-antenna packaging)- Better-than-average receptionCons:- No Bluetooth- No ""ordinary"" ring tones out of the box"
4,Excellent phone except the battery life,"I have had this phone after 7 days it released to the US market.So far, it works great: 16bit color, 5 mega bytes picture memory, great design, clear sound quality, good reception(in my neighborhood), customizable wallpapers, etc.The only thing that bothers me is the battery life. There is only one battery comes with the phone, unlike my previous phone s-105, which has two batteries. Unless you only use your phone for talking and calling, the picture messenging and camera drain the battery FAST!!!, so get ready to disconnect it anytime if you don't charge it freguently."
4,Samsung E715 Voice Dialing!,"This phone is great excect a cpuple of features. The good news is the flash and the picture sizing is beautiful. However, when I pay ove $300.00 I expect all of the features. This phone does NOT have voice dialing and I was very disapointed. I was mis lead by a certain website that it did have this feature. The other feature it doesn't have is a speakerphone. I'm sure this is all a part of marketing but It would be nice to have it all!"
3,Almost perfect..,"This phone is really nice looking and has a lot of amazing functions...but the battery life seems very short and bad, especially for people like me, who talk on the cellphones all the time..I think I have to recharge my cellphone everyday...and an extra battery is needed...><"
3,On time,"This book is considered a ""must"" for all editors. Murch is pretty famous for his work and style so, in my opinion, I agree it's worth the read (and worth having). My book arrived on time and in the condition promised!Satisfied customer overall!"
3,more walter murch,are walter murch books overrated? at least there's no trace of michael ondaajte (spelling?) here.
4,I enjoyed it,This is a very interesting twist on film editing from a very accomplished editor. With every chapter comes a very inventive way of describing each facet of the editing process.
3,i read it in the blink of an eye,"a quick and easy read. i was expecting a more in depth look into the editing process, but this book just skimmed the surface. i guess its hard to get that much info into such a short book. other than that, it was a very enjoyable read. murch compares the directing styles of several filmmakers and the pros and cons of different editing outlets (ie. mechanical vs. electronic). he uses lovely analogies to describe the editing process, such as comparing it to dancing. its a good book for a plane ride."
3,A fine book if you have no knowledge of editing.,"I found this book to state the obvious (to me) more than it did anything else. If you're very new to editing, or feel the need to learn by reading (as opposed to doing) you'll probably get something out of it."
3,Wheat mixed with chaff,"I suspect this book was worth five stars the day it was written but that's been a while. The author's editing experenences are very interesting and his theories on editing make the book worthwhile to anyone currently editing. Unfortunately, too much of the book is used to consider the pluses of continuing to work with mechanical editors and film as opposed to working with the earlier versions of editing software. The title refers to a suggested length of a cut, and the whole part of the book dealing with editing theory probably makes this books still worthwhile, especially at its current price."
5,Walter Gets It.,"Very few humans, accept for some aboriginal communities, respect earth's natural processes. Walter gets it. It is us humans, who want to exploite the earth to our benefit that is throwing the planet out of balance. Dr. Walt realizes that fire ants have learned to thrive on our disturbances of the ecosystem. Anyone who is willing to take the time to write a 750+ page large format, fine print book on such a hated insect must be respected. What a phenomenal composition. Take a chance on this book."
2,Needs more rock in this boat,"I bought this on the heels of the other new remix project ""Chant Down Babylon"". The production values on that record are much better, if not entirely in the classic reggae style. A few good mixes here, but a tinny sound, and mixed results. There's a good remix of ""The Sun is Shining"" that's supposed to be on the CD, but wasn't. Instead my copy has the same version of ""Soul Rebel"" twice on the CD. Where's the quality assurance?"
1,Sun Is NOT Shining,"I like this CD, but I give it a low rating because it does not include ""Sun Is Shining - (Silverbeam remix)"". ""Soul Rebel - (Pistel remix)"" is in its place."
5,Kenya A-Z is Part of a Great New Series!,"Not too long, not too dry, non-fiction and very readable. Remember those horrible non-fiction country books you had to do book reports from in elementary school? Hopefully those dull books are gone forever. This book was so nice and affordable, I bought it from the local bookstore. I may even get the entire series for my classroom."
4,Beautiful Photography,"When I bought this book, I was a little unsure if it was a children's book or a travel book! It is a small, beautiful photo essay of Kenya. Be aware, however, that it only covers the ""good parts."" This isn't a definitive overview of the country. However, it gave us a very realistic idea of what to experience in certain parts of the country. This was a very enjoyable read, and is one we will continue to enjoy for some time to come."
1,HS830 Helmet Headset,"Bluetooth HS830 Helmet HeadsetThis is not the HS830 Helmet Headset. All that is shipped is the HS830 Pendant Headset. I contacted eMallGroup and they assured me the photo is correct. This means eMallGroup does not ship the Helmet portion with the boom noise-cancelling microphone.I would love to be able to give a proper review of this device, but since it doesn't not come with the Helmet portion it is useless to me.Thanks for your time."
1,Description is Misleading,This is not the HS830 Motorcycle Helmet Bluetooth. The dealer is posting a misleading advertisement. What I bought is not as advertised and the vendor is NOT replying to my emails. I will have to ask Amazon to intervene and recover my money.Dave
3,Good,The only problem I have is that when riding and trying to talk the noise from the engine is too loud to talk with the engine off you can hear and talk.
2,It just works... for a while,"Exceeds the performance of any ear-based device currently on the market. The key is the in-line speaker bud and it's proximity to the mouth when the earpiece is inserted into the ear. No other device can match the distortion free clarity of this design. In fact, I feel that it's less obtrusive than the large ""look-at-me"" cauliflower styles that designer's keep porting to the masses. Yes, I could do without the large blue beacon but still.UPDATE: The unit died so I purchased another one which also died within a month. I can no longer recommend this product due to the high failure rate.~ Digital Dude"
3,Hmm,"Not exactly what i was hoping for, it is handy however the battery doesn't last as long as you'd expect..."
1,A Big Design Issue,"I bought HS830 last December but was never able to use it since the ear bud was big and silippy which could never stay in my either ear. My husband could wear it but still felt uncomfortable because of its size and stiffness. I contacted Motorola twice who just try to ignore the issue. If you cannot try the ear bud before you purchase it, avoid this product."
2,What a let down.,"I ordered this item in May, 2006. I had a previous bluetooth headset the HS500, but it was so small I forgot it in my pocket and it went through the washer. It was still working but most of the time people could not hear me. I wanted another handsfree device that would be big enough so I would not forget it in my pocket. The product worked well the reception was good, but last month it just stopped working. I could not hear anything on the device and I have had the product only for 9 months. I expected a product to work for at least a year before it quits on me."
2,PEACH WITHOUT THE DODGY ANGLES . . . . .,"ARIAS SECRET DESIRES is basicly a PEACH DVD without thedodgy mutiple camera angles. It features 7 very attractivegirls, including ARIA GIOVANNI, one of the sexiestwomen on the planet. Although the girls tease and pose inbikinis, tiny skirts and nothing at all, unfortunatlythe action is VERY SOFT, with mainly full frontalviews, and only a few quick ""between the legs"" shotshere and there. The camera work is a bit wobbly, but thescenery is amazing with lots of colour.The picture qualityis excellent, with a near perfect DVD transfer.Although this is better than most PEACH shows, it iscertainly not the best ""Softcore"" DVD available.If you want REAL eye candy, get one of HOT BODY's latestDVD's, which show FULL nudity, stunning girls and muchbetter camerawork and editing"
1,Waste of money,This is a big waste of money. It only shows different girls taking their stuff off and touching themselves. Not good at all. I was very disappointed. Would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Beer se uber gees review,It is absolutely great.Angus Young still rips it in the guitar and they just rock!
5,A review of Spyro Gyra's Original Cinema.,"Original Cinema is Spyro Gyra's most current release. It is from 2003. It is a quite good cd. Especially, for being modern Spyro Gyra. All 13 songs are written and performed quite well. In fact, Marc Quinones and Dave Samuels make some guest appearances on this album.My top 3 favorite songs would have to be 2,4, and 6. Extrovertical is a terrific piece written by Jay. It is also the longest song on here, coming in at around 6:21. Party of Seven is also another great song, as well as the short Close-Up. All of the musicians come together here to make a great modern day Spyro Gyra album.There is also a nice manual included with the cd with some great pictures of the guys. Original Cinema is also an enhanced cd. That means that it also includes artist profiles, video, and much more.This album is a sucsessful Spyro Gyra release and is definetly worth the buy. You won't regret it. Thank you for taking the time and generosity to read my review."
4,Best Spyro Gyra work in years,"With its excellent production and good mix of up-tempo and slower tunes, Original Cinema is the best Spyro Gyra CDs in years. In fact, you have to go back to 1993's Dreams Beyond Control to find a more well-rounded Spyro Gyra CD. It features some of the traditional Spyro Gyra sound in tunes like ""Bump It Up"", ""Party of Seven"", and ""Big Dance Number"", good songs for Smooth Jazz Radio like ""Close Up"" and ""Getaway"", the mysterious ""Film Noir"" and the african sound of ""Cape Town Love"". I would highly recommend this CD to any true Smooth Jazz fan!"
5,One of My Favorites,"I have almost all the SG CD's. When I first got this one, I had my doubts. But after playing it a few times through, it is now one of my favorites...it stays in the CD tray. I just wish I could see them live here in Houston sometime."
4,I have only used it once,"The three sections are arms/shoulders, chest/back, and abs. I would have preferred a workout that just focused on the arms and back and skipped the abas section. (I already do abs of steel every day) The segments are great (I have only done them once), they went by so quickly, I was sad when the 15 minutes were up! These are my initial thoughts, I might change it to 5 stars after I get over the 3rd segment focusing on the abs."
2,I am disapointed in Tamilee!,"I have enjoyed Tamilee Webb's workout videos for a couple of years so I thought that one of her videos would be just the thing to add definition to my arms. However I was thoroughly disapointed in this video. There are three 15 minute segments, one is devoted to the arms, another to the back and chest and the last to the abs. The segments include a warm up and stretching and there is just not enough time devoted to actually working out each muscle group. I was looking forward to a real Tamilee workout that worked each muscle in the upper body to exhaustion. The only good thing about these workouts is they are quick. If you are looking to improve the appearance or strength of your arms this is not the video for you."
5,A different view of the Peloponnesian War,"Rather than a typical history that presents a chronology of battles, 'A War Like No Other' gives the reader a feel for what it was like to be a participant during the war. The chapters on the plague and ships were particularly illuminating, as the former put the reader inside the Athenian walls during her darkest hours, while the latter puts the reader in the position of one of hundreds of rowers on a trireme. The chapter on horses was quite good as well, as it gives the reader an appreciation of the magnitude of the disaster that was the Sicilian expedition.The book also includes chapters discussing the origins of the war and the war's aftermath, framing it into the bigger picture of Greek history.Finally, the book contrasts the various ways the Pelopennesian War was fought with the code of warfare that existed in Greece for centuries prior. All in all, Hanson succeeds admirably in illustrating why the Peloponnesian War truly was a war like no other."
1,"CAVEAT: Victor Hanson is NOT a ""military"" historian.","Victor Hanson is NOT a ""military"" historian. Hanson is an excellent classical historian - but not a ""military"" historian. Unfortunately, he has been passing himself off as a ""military"" historian for years without challenge. After 28+ years of active duty military service, and a personal library of more than 1000 rare ans standard military titles - I find Hanson's ""military"" analyses highly flawed, shallow, and amateurish at best - and that is exactly what I find again in this book. One should read Hanson for his classical historian abilities - but not for his ""military"" analyses."
5,Dr. Hanson Does it Again!,"It is a gifted writer indeed who can take ancient history and make it come alive. Dr. Hanson does it, not only bringing it to life but also demonstrating its relevance to today. Nice work, Sir!"
2,Make sure the model is what you require,I ordered the travel adaptor based on description and photo so I was disappointed when the order arrived I was disappointent that it was not what I sought and did not match the photo.Drew A
3,Great is you can get it for half off,If this item is at least 50% off it's original price then it is worth it. Other than that most of it's costs are tied up in packaging.
4,Poems that reflect a dark time in the German speaking people,"The years 1910 - 1930 were traumatic ones for the German-speaking people. It began with a sense of being surrounded; they were soundly defeated in war and the empire of Austria-Hungary dismembered, there was the hyperinflation in the early twenties and the start of a depression at the end. As the title and the times would suggest, this collection of poems does not express a buoyant optimism. Expressions of positive emotions are rare and understated; the illustrations are woodcuts that drip with melancholy.The editors made an effort to include the poems of lesser-known writers; the poems are by Max Beckmann, Wassily Kandinsky, Else Lasker-Schuler, Georg Trakl and Egon Schiele. These poems express the opposite reality of love poems, life looked at as something to be endured and tolerated rather than enjoyed."
3,The struggle to create the constitution,"This book provides a detailed look at the events that led to the writing of the U.S. Constitution, as well as three of the men instrumental in the creation of the document. I must confess to not having known much of what occurred between the end of the War for Independence and the drafting of the constitution. This book helps illuminate this very unstable period in U.S. history and highlights the flaws in the Articles of Confederation. We see how the political struggles between those who wanted a strong central government (including Madison, Hamilton, and Jay) and those who favored a looser coalition of states shaped the compromises that created our constitution. I also learned a great deal more about Madison, Hamilton, and Jay and their roles in bringing the constitution into existance. Very informative!"
2,lack of inspriation,"I was really excited about seeing into mysterious and hard to get to Bhutan. Really the film is just too superficial, lacks coherent direction and seldom touches the really interesting aspects of third world life. It is like some freshman college students decided to make a film for class at the end of first semester. You can tell the country is beautiful and full of much more interesting stimulus. But at least they opened the door. So thanks.."
2,A Little Disappointing,"After hearing so much about Bhutan, I was disappointed that this was all that the team could come up with. Also, it lacks brightness in general, I don't know if it's the colors or lighting, or what. However, it's not bad considering there's barely anything out there on Bhutan. And I think it's worth the money. If you only had to get one video on Bhutan, though, I'd go for the Living Edens one instead."
5,Exactly as Described,The larger size was recommended by my stylist & it's fantastic. It arrived quickly and it as exactly as described.
3,For longer hair,"I liked the brush, but I just bought too big a size for my just below the shoulder hair. I couldnt style with it as i used my blow dryer because I couldnt wrap my hair around it in a complete revolution if you know what I mean. My bad. A 2 1/2"" is perfect. Great brush though."
2,Too big and heavy,"This brush does a great job of smoothing your hair, but it's so heavy I found my hand cramping up and had to take breaks while blow drying. It's also HUGE so unless you have really long hair, dont use this brush...you might as well use a straightener."
3,Fabulous until...,"I paid $30 for this brush at my local salon. It is amazing. My hair is naturally curly/wavy, and this actually allows me to perform a blow out without killing my arm. It makes the hair smooth, shiny and soft. However, four months after I purchased, I went to go dry my hair and the handle snapped in half. I am hoping that I just had a malfunctioned brush, but I'm really disappointed. For me to spend $30 on a brush was a stretch, and now it's all for nothing."
2,Not all that,This is not anything special for me. I do not see this brush any different from the other dozen brushes I have purchased over the years. It's just bigger.
2,Very basic info,"This slim and small volume gives you basic information about using a home camcorder. Published in 1995, the section on camcorder equipment is already half outdated. The techniques sections cover zooming, panning, tilting, composing, etc. Each of the 101 tips is very brief, to the point of not being too helpful sometimes. For example, lighting -- a very important topic -- receives only superficial coverage.While this book can be carried with you easily, overall it's a disappointment. If you are genuinely green to camcorder videography, this can get you started. If you are looking to improve your videos, look elsewhere."
5,The Best Nursery Rhymes EVER!,"I LOVE this book/CD combo. I live in Hawaii half the year and bought it for my daughter when she was 3. The tunes to the nursery rhymes are catchy and easy on the ears for us adults! The lyrics and photos in the book are very creative and educational, yet fun! The book also comes with a glossary of Hawaiian terms with phonetic pronunciation, which is very helpful.I have purchased numerous copies of this as gifts for friends and family. Most recently I purchased one for the first grade and kindergarten teachers at my daughter's Ohio school. They were having a Hawaiian theme and the kids love it!The author personally signs the book when you order from this site, another plus which makes your gift more meaningful."
2,Breaks easily,"I had this brush and it snapped at the neck after a few uses, making the brush-head loose and wobly. I wanted to like it, but found that the quality just wasn't there."
3,Some piece of dried spices got stuck in the teeth.,"I have been using this pastry brush for about two years. I actually own two of these. I generally appreciate the ease of cleaning the silicone brush by just throwing it in the dishwasher, but I was pretty surprised that after a hefty hand washing, I found some dried herbs and spices stuck in between the silicone teeth. It DID however survive my hefty hand washing!I use this brush to apply olive oil mixed with herb and spices on chicken or potatoes before roasting. It works pretty well here (other than the spice being stuck). I also use it to grease baking pans. I used to use a bristle brush but every once in a while I'd see one of the hairs in the vegetable shortening.My only complaint is that it doesn't nicely and evenly spread like a bristle brush, but, for it's sanitary and ease to clean (in a dishwasher), I still give it three stars."
5,Ingenious for the serious baster,"This brush comes with little yellow strips in the middle of the silicone that look like a miniature version of the game ""Connect Four"" - :) - the little loops hold the oil so it does not drip. It's really ingenious, and I wish I had thought of it. It's such a simple, but useful, concept...I don't see why anyone would need another brush if they are only going for everyday home cooking."
4,"I like the design, but I worry a little about keeping it really clean.","I worry a lot about kitchen hygiene and preventing the nasties, so not being able to take it apart is a concern."
5,"Nice item, not just for pastry","Works basting meat, etc. as well as pastry. Holds onto glaze and spreads it nicely. Does just what it is supposed to. Cleans in dishwasher well."
4,3 years and still works,"doesn't hold as much liquid as a bristle basting brush, but easier to clean and works well enough for me to prefer the silicone version"
2,Not a great brush for baking/pastry applications,"I mostly use pastry brushes for just that: brushing melted butter over pastry specifically filo. I was really getting sick of the bristles shedding from my traditional bristle brush and was hoping that this brush would help. Well it does accomplish that: there is no shedding whatsoever. However, it is not as gentle as a bristle brush and pulls and tears the filo. It also doesn't spread the butter on the pastry nicely, more like uneven streaks. It seems to hold a fair amount of butter but the amount that actually gets deposited on the brushing surface is small. It is easy to clean though, so I'll give it a point for that.So if you're buying this to use for actual baking/pastry applications, I'd say this is not a good brush for you. However if you're using it for brushing melted butter on a pan, waffle iron, etc. then this brush would be fine for the job."
3,OK. Doesn't hold as much as I hoped.,"For buttering pans, it's OK I guess. It cleans SOOO much better than traditional brushes--which is why I got it. Might be better for glazes and thicker liquids.I guess the same things that make it good for cleaning make it mediocre for brushing. I'm not throwing out my old bristle brushes yet, but I'm not throwing this one out either."
5,A quick simple pastry brush,"Having had standard pastry brushes from nylon to my grandmothers which resembled horsehair, and other silicone from other manufactures my expectation was not that great. Well hush my mouth and roll me in egg batter this one really works!!!!! A delight both to use and a snap to clean. If you want a life altering experience with a pastry brush this one is the ticket."
4,Standard Pastry Brush,"When I first received these brushes; I bought 4 for numerous uses. I wasn't impressed by what I saw. Silicon bristles were a bit bent and strip inserted in middle of brush appeared flimsy. I was mistaken - brush is easy to hold (older hands), the silicon bristles worked very well when I basted a chicken with butter before roasting it. The insert did exactly what they said it would; it held on to a lot of melted butter while I was using brush - making it easier not to have to keep dipping regular brush into liquid multiple times. Clean up was very quick and easy compared to regular brushes - came out much cleaner with no residual melted butter left on it. Good brush for the money."
5,Still prefer real bristles,"For pastry (flour dusting) I still prefer real bristles. But for egg-wash and basting with liquids, I love this because it can be cleaned so easily. Won't hold flavors or stains."
5,Perfect Mop Applicator for BBQ Slow Cooking,"This is great for applying BBQ mops and sauces that tend to make bristle/mop brushes die an early death. This thing holds way more liquid than it looks like it should, and cleans up GREAT - even with the vinegar and tomato sauce based applications typically used while smoking."
4,"It's ok, but........",I still at times use a disposible paint brush. I just like the bristles on a paint brush at times over the silicone ones. I does clean up nicely though.
2,Wrong picture of Brush,I just bought this brush based on the default picture which showed a pastry brush. What I got is the brush shown in the second picture which is of a basting brush. A basting brush and a pastry brush are two different things. This brush is in fact a basting brush NOT a pastry brush. I have to send mine back.
3,"Durable, efficient substitute for traditional pastry brush","I bought this after my old pastry brush bristles kept falling into my food. This brush does the job, but tends to spread more heavily than a traditional brush."
2,Couldn't get the smell out,"I purchased this brush based on the Cook's Illustrated review and used it for the first time to baste fish with an Asian glaze. Even though I cleaned the brush immediately thereafter, I couldn't remove the soy/ginger smell from the brush. (I used vinegar, baking soda, and the dishwasher to no avail.) Other reviews note how easy it is to clean, which is true, but for me, it smelled after the first use. I need to buy a new brush now, and it won't be an Oxo."
1,Poor Quality,"We purchased an OXO basting brush when we got married 3 years ago. We had not used it very often, perhaps a total of 10 times, before the section that holds all the bristles popped off. This was about a year ago. My wife and I are very disappointed, considering that OXO Good Grips is known for its quality products. This one, however, is apparently the exception to the rule Not only did the part with all the bristles snap off, but it cannot be repaired, rendering the brush useless. We are currently hunting for another brush that works as well as it did, but does not break so easily."
1,Terrible,"These types of pastry brushes are prone to issues. I selected this brush as a replacement, hoping made by Oxo, it would be durable. Instead, it promptly fell apart during my first use and left bristles all over my food. Terrible and expensive!"
5,Really useful kitchen tool!,"I was tired of using my fingers to get an even coat of oil on something, or to do an egg wash, etc.. So I finally got around to getting a brush.So far I have used it for brushing thin coats of oil on veggies to roast. For that alone I am glad I got this, my roasted veggies are coming out so perfectly browned now it was totally worth it. Cleaning is a snap cause you can just toss it in the dishwasher.Great kitchen tool, I would totally recommend it!"
5,Great! And easy to clean!!,"I love this brush. I use it to coat my pans before cooking, or to brush olive oil on breads and crusts before baking. It holds the liquid well and spreads evenly. Most importantly it is dishwasher safe and so easy to clean!"
3,Why,"I love the Stooges, i've been a fan for over ten years now. I just cant understand how dvds are put together. This set could have included the classic Shivering Sherlocks and Hot Scots instead of Calling all Curs and Flat Foot Stooges. Its one mans opinion but I know the Stooges very well. I know the man who puts these dvds out isnt Stooge fan, maybe just a causal fan. I use to write the man who wrote an encloypedia on them. We had some great chats about Stooges. Its time for Columbia to wake up and release ""ALL"" Stooge shorts onto one massive set. I mean if we can get Newlyweds or Simple Life on dvd so fast, why not the Stooges? Granted Stooge shorts range from classic to forgetable. They could divide them into three parts-Curly, Shemp, and Joe. Six shorts on one dvd is bare minuim, they could easily put 10-15 on each disc. I would love some bonus material on them as well. I think its about time to give Stooges there due."
4,Pretty Good,"This DVD offers some very good shorts (like ""Who Done It?"" and ""Calling All Currs"".) The picture quality on this disc is sometimes very grainy but overall it's pretty good (and it has the best transfer of public domain short ""Disorder in the Court"" I've yet seen.) A good buy."
5,NEW REVIEW !!,"THE REASON that this DVD costs between one and two dollarsis because everybody is buying the entire collection:THE ULTIMATE STOOGES' COLLECTION.You just might prefer this collection if your primary languge isn't English.This collection is in the spoken-languages of:ENGLISH/SPANISH , with subtitles in:ENGLISH/SPANISH/FRENCH.DISORDER IN THE COURT..............1936FLATFOOT STOOGE...............1938CALLING ALL CURS...............1939DIZZY DETECTIVES...............1943CRIME ON THEIR HANDS...............1948WHO DONE IT?...............1949"
1,Not as expected,"We were disappointed in the quality, very tipsy even with the brackets on the legs. The plastic screen looks cheap. Not a good purchase for us, we purchased 2 and never opened the second one, now it's in the basement in a box because it's too expensive to ship back to company."
3,"Excellent for newcomers to Forms, needs more complex code","I bought the book as it is one of very few available that covers Forms 5.0. I am a newcomer to Forms and needed something to get me up and running. This book was ideal for this purpose. It thoroughly covers all features of Forms though it does not give enough detailed examples to make it of use to me in the future. The index is hopeless. When will there be a book available with a professionally designed / written complex multi-form example which gives extensive coverage of the use of forms triggers, built-in packages and user written packages ?? Will the upcoming 'Oracle Advanced Developer: Forms and Reports' remedy this ?"
3,This book will not help experienced programmers,"On seeing a dedicated third party book on Forms 5.0 I started reading this book with lot of expectations. This book contains lot of unwanted information and it is too lengthy. Lot of unnecessary stuff has been included in the book. Even the CD-ROM contains certain things available along with the D2k CD. One example is the Calendar control which is already there with D2K. The book could have been much crisper and smaller with lot of new codes, examples about use of different triggers , coding techniques which could be used and a small application using all this should have been included at the end rather than from the beginning. It might help to improve a fresher rather than a person who has already done good amount of coding in D2K. Overall the size of the book scares one rather than the contents."
1,Use of CD instruction is totally confusing,"At a very minimum, I would expect Albert Lulushi to write a comprehensive instruction on how to load examples of his application into Oracle 8. I never found the CD useful because I can't populate my database with examples on the CD. The preface lack a clear cut instruction on how to populate database with the examples in the book. The fact that there's no clear instruction render the book and the CD perfectly USELESS."
3,"Lots of information, poorly organized","This book contains a lot of information about Oracle forms. It is, however, an introductory book and is quickly left behind as the layers and complexities of Forms peel off. One thing that is extremely frustrating is the lack of organization and the ability to pinpoint solutions. I would love to have an electronic search capability on this book to assist in finding items because the index is woefully inadequate."
2,Not for experienced Forms Developers,The book is fine for first timers wanting to get to grips with forms and how to use it. It also covers topics such as SQL and PL/SQL enabling you to get a grounding in these areas. But if your are already conversant in these areas and are looking for a more advanced reference then this will disapoint you. It doesn't contain enough detail for experienced developers.
5,This is the best computer book I've ever seen.,"Excellent book. Coherent design, with developing your own forms through the book. The author simply knows what he is talking about. Many real life solutions for real life problems in the complicated world of Oracle. With this book the learning curve for Developer/2000 is flat. If you want to be sure that after reading only 1 book you'll be able to finish your first Forms project, get it. This is the best computer book I've ever seen."
1,Completely Disorganized,"I am not impressed with either the book's layout or Lulushi's style. I misses certain basic concepts completely and glosses over others. Additionally, the index is painfully bare - good luck trying to look anything up!"
3,"Excellent for newcomers to Forms, needs more complex code","I bought the book as it is one of very few available that covers Forms 5.0.

1,Too Bulky and boring,"I brought this book and returned it. I recommend another book A GUIDE TO ORACLE by Joline Morrison and Mike Morrison . We use this as a text book for our Oracle Database class. This is a good introductory book published by COURSE Technology,one main street, Cambridge, MA 02142. Topics are Oracle forms, Reports, Graphics, Creating Oracle Database forms,Creating Custom forms,creating custom forms to support business application, Creating Web application with oracle webserver,...... etc"
1,Not for experienced Oracle Programmers,"If you are an experienced Oracle server programmer and want to learn Developer 2000, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! After the first two chapters (which are the most useful parts of this book), the subject matter is on basic programming, design, data modelling, object oriented programming concepts, SQL and PL/SQL. The book gets back to the subject on using the tool, after a few hundred pages of this stuff. The subject matter doesn't tie into what was discussed from the first two chapters. Definately, not a good book for experienced programmers"
1,"Too many errors: typos, technical errors and poor grammar.","This book seems to have been rushed to print with poor editorial support behind it by Prentice-Hall. I have used this book in the classroom for two semesters in a first database course with seniors in Information Systems. I will not use the book again. Chapter 11 on Object-Relational Oracle8 and PL/SQL8 is the worst written chapter, only to be outdone in the realm of incomprehensibility by documentation from Oracle Corporation itself. Also the physical binding on the book fell apart within four months. For a beginning Oracle database student I would recommend: Morrison, Mike and Joline Morrison, A Guide to Oracle 8 (Course Technology, 2000) The treatment is not as deep, but much clearer and better organized."
3,Good Ideas; No Taste,"Driving along one day, I heard some interesting ideas played in the lower register of a tenor trombone. I looked at my XM/Sirius display and saw the name Steve Turre. As soon as I got home, I ordered one of his CDs from Amazon. I hastily inserted it into my computer's CD drive as soon as it arrived.It was necessary to turn the volume down twice in order to get any connection with what were brilliant, yes brilliant, ideas and incredible technique; unfortunately, I had a hard time keeping the CD playing because of the constant bombarding of my senses with those great ideas, that amazing technique, and Turre's absolute lack of taste.I did stick it out to the bitter end, hoping to find some semblance of musical content. I think Turre would have made an excellent drummer."
5,awesome line of toys,"This is my second Booda Bellie dog toy. My golden retriever loves them, they are well made, and they have the best bellowing sound that dogs love. Could not recommend more highly!"
3,Not for big dogs/aggressive chewers!,My dogs thoroughly enjoyed this toy....for 10 minutes until the head and arms were pulled off! Fun toy for small to medium sized dogs. Didn't work for 2 Great Dane puppies.
2,Had to sew it back together within a day,My dog loves this toy but it is not very durable. Let me start by saying our six month old german shepherd is very gentle with her toys. She still has most of them from the first day we brought her home at eight weeks old. Imagine my surprise after seeing two inch hole in the seam of the booda bear after the first night. I sewed it up and it has been holding pretty good so maybe it was just a weak spot.
2,Arms ripped off in first hour.,"My bully loved it...but it was torn apart within the first hour. Although, there aren't many toys that last too long with my boy."
5,Booda Belles giraffe is tons of fun,"Duke had a Booda Belles giraffe once upon a time and he loved throwing it in the air and biting it. We would see him walk around with Booda in his mouth. It was hilarious. But soon enough, his giraffe was full of holes and torn. It was great that Amazon had a new Booda Belles giraffe. This Christmas he saw Booda after not seeing it for a while and he was the happiest dog ever!"
3,Best toy,The toy has giving my dog tons of play time. He loves throwing it around the yard. He loves it.
1,Destroyed,"Leo, my toy poodle destroyed the Polar Bear in a matter of a hour. This is the first toy Leo has destroyed in an hour.Poor quality and not worth the money. Bought the product after reading good reviews."
5,"Wine, candles, exotic daydreams.","In my search for middle eastern music, I usually find the horrible disco-pop stuff that makes you think of aggressive, oily men with a lot of bad cologne and exposed chest hair. In this CD, however, you will find exotic, worldy rhythms of the middle east that evoke images of ""Oriental"" splendor. But you will also notice the sincerity of the artists, marked as much by technical talent as with soul and emotion borne of a longing for home and family. There is a nice mix of instumentals and vocals. A very traditional, pure expression of Arab music."
2,Disappointing,"Sound quality was not very good and musically, I could not appreciate it, however valuable it may be from an educational & historical point of view."
5,The definitive book for Bluebird nest box monitors!,"The Bluebirding world has waited a long time for this book. If you just have one Bluebird nest box in the yard, or hundreds covering miles of territory, this book is a must have. Profusely illustrated with color photos.The authors of this book did not create a ""coffee table"" book; they created a work that will guide you through your day to day problems with predators, such as snakes, raccoons, house sparrows, and starlings.I am a Bluebirder with years of experience, and I learned a lot and keep learning from the book!"
4,"Excellent Story, Music Great but Sometimes Long Winded","This is a top of the line concept album. I thought all the songs were great, but I got a feeling that they went too far with some of their instrumental sections. Now I like heavy music (Iron Maiden, Rush, Queensryche, etc.), but even for me, their ""jams"" distracted me from the songs and storylines. This is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. I still enjoy this work emmensely, but I find myself using my forward button on my CD player remote during the instrumental jams. My opinion is that the story flows much better when you do this."
5,Wonderful music...ears nectar...,The best music out there. Hearing this while driving a Ferrari is great...
5,Totally Great!!!,"This was my first Dream Theater album I got into, as with many (the first album i bought was When Dream and Day Unite). I was totally blown away with the instrumental part of Fatal Tragedy, and that started a huge Dream Theater binge in me that will hopefully never end. I don't get why people will rate this below a 5, granted this is all opinion. The album was totally great, they showed off, as usual, but still kept their own sound and made it tasteful. The lyrics in many of the songs were totally great, and the style of them could never be better. The songs on this can appeal to people of all genres, metalheads or no. Dream Theater totally rules, and everyone at least acknowledges that."
3,"good, but not their best","i've listened to the new DT album a dozen times and find myself thinking the same thing everytime- great when it is great, horrible when it is horrible.there is no real flow from jam to jam. at times it is as if they mixed it incorrectly. parts are too cluttered and seem to ramble on and on.the crispness of the past isn't always there, almost as if they became disinterested during certain parts of the recording.the idea is there and is a good one, it just didn't gel as well as Mindcrime, 2112 or The Wall. however, a true DT fan will want this album.over time it may grow into my top ten play list."
3,All the hype is just wacky...,"I agree with the few other reviewers that have said, 'Just because it's Met. II doesn't automatically qualify it as a classic.'This is a wild, sometimes-great, but ultimately unfocused effort that does not see the band heading in what was, until now, a very natural progression - tighter songwriting, and greater diversity. This just feels like a 77 minute free-for-all where your attention drifts off around the middle. I'll agree that the first half is REALLY good, but the back end is loaded with hair-raising musicianship that just outlasts its welcome.Oh, and the only way to compensate for the VERY marginal mix is to play it LOUD.This is good, but as progmetal goes, DT no longer owns this category outright, and there's other bands out there doing as well, if not better. Check you Mayadome and Clockwork..."
5,WOW,"Dream Theater have managed to raise the bar on every one with this release. Their songwriting is superb and dynamic and with the addition of Jordan Rudess, musicianship is at an all time high.(not to discount Kevin and Dereks contributions)If you have read this far, YOU MUST BUY THIS DISC. You will not be dissapointed."
4,The lyrics cost them a star,"This CD has, hands down, the best combination of musicianship that I have ever heard in rock music. The complex meters and tempo changes keep you from getting bored, as well as the incredible technique exhibited by all of the musicians. But one thing that this recording seriously suffers from is unoriginal, cliche lyrics (as in many, many songs put out by Dream Theater). The songs go through a bland narration of the events of Nicholas's past (the protagonist of the story). To put it bluntly, if the lyrics suck, then no amount of fancy playing will be able to salvage an otherwise undisputed masterpiece."
3,"Good music, poor production quality","As a long-time Dream Theater fan, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this CD. I'm disappointed. What seems like great music is dulled by poor production quality. It's difficult to pick out some of the instruments' parts. Sometimes I'll hear hints of a keyboard line which sounds like it might really add to music, if only it had been brought out more. The jam sessions don't sound as tight as I expect from Dream Theater, I think largely due to the mudiness of the recording. I feel like I'm listening to the CD with a blanket over my head. If things were recorded more cleanly and intruments brought out more during the mix, this CD may have earned another star or two. Too bad. The story is interesting and the lyrics decent. This CD really could have been something."
3,Boring....not their best,"Ladies and Gentlemen, if you thirst for a true masterpiece in concept albums, may I suggest ""Brave"" by Marillion...that unbelievably resembles this CD. Actually, I would venture to say that Marillion has grounds to sue on theft of intellectual property!!!! Trewavas and Portnoy have collaborated in the past...that would perhaps explain the exchange of ideas. However, Scenes doesn't come close to Brave in its portrayal of pain and absolution. Listen to Brave..and then you'll laugh at Scenes. That is not to say that these guys are some of the most talented musical freaks on the planet!!!"
3,"Good, but not their best","DT is one of my favorite bands. So when this album came out I was pretty quick to snap one up.I was very disappointed with the album upon first listening though. I have warmed a great deal to it since, but I still feel it is not their best work. Many songs had great content but felt flat or unfinished. Some songs sounded good but didn't have the normal DT flair and attention to detail. A few of the lyrics were just plain absurd, DT has always had strong song writing as one of its best strengths.Overall it was a sad album for the group. I'd rank it as worth listening too but not worth buying unless you are a real DT fan who wants all their albums. If you are new to DT, get Awake first and either ""Images and Words"" or ""Train of Thought"" second. They are much better albums then this one."
1,WAY OVERRATED.,"Yes, if you are a fan of prog-metal, you must buy this CD. But beware: it is NOT the best album ever (it isn't even DT's best). It suffers from the regressive progressive disease: trite lyrics, overseriousness, nothing truely innovative sounding (although a measureable quantity of maturity), and a heaping lack of soul. The last is most important.It is a good CD if you are into the stuff that makes it emberressing to tell people that you like prog. It certainly does not deserve to be on ANY list that chronicles the best ever.There are a number of good prog bands putting out music much degrees better than SFaM, but with little to no attention applied. They are worth checking out."
1,This album is horrible,"This album is not good. It's too long, too boring, and there are way too many keyboards."
1,Nothing New,"Scenes From a Memory is a blatent rip off of Queensryche's ""Operation:Midncrime"" crossed with Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"". In fact, Mike Portnoy, the drummer, said himself in a radio interview that this album was influenced by those two. Rather than saying these two albums influenced Scenes From a Memory, I would say the two albums were mixed together and SFAM was the result. Except that the themes explored here aren't worth exploring. The story line is uninteresting. If you are looking for good, interesting progressive rock, either get Operation:Mindcrime, The Wall, or one of Dream Theaters other albums, not this one."
1,Lame,"I'm sorry, but that's the only word I can use to describe this stuff. Oh, wait...""mediocre"" is another. And, for the reviwer below who put King Crimson in the same paragraph with this band should be ashamed of themselves. I'm headed to the record store now to see if I can get a buck or two by selling it!"
4,a good effort but too much narrative,"the excitement that 'metropolis part 1' created was due in part to its ambiguity. while i love dream theater, and i feel that this new CD is a great piece of music, it is far too bogged down in the lyrics for me. it drags in places, though there are areas of genius throughout. the relationship of lyric to music is an important one, and one that petrucci might want to explore more. labrie is a great vocalist, but the lyrics were not tailored to the music well enough. when they came together, it was amazingly awesome(tracks 3, and 8, 10 and 11), but where they lagged, i felt distracted. overall the music is a tremendous experience, and in places the lyrics are inspiring (track 11). ""liquid tention experiment 1 & 2"" did more for me musically, however. ""scenes from a memory"" is a good CD, and a nice experience, but not as beautiful as ""change of seasons""."
5,THE BEST BAND EVER,another piece of excellent work from the king's of progressive... with joining of jordan rudess they become unforgettable... if u real want to feel the real music do yourself a favor and buy this...
5,Awesome Progressive Rock Album,I never heard of this group before I saw them on Youtube. I liked a few songs off this album when I saw them on Youtube. This is a great album. One of the best progressive rock albums in my collection.
1,WTF,"OMG, this album is so lame, this is not music, and this john petrucci guy thinks he's good at guitar? His stuff is so easy to play, he's not even that fast, his legato playing sucks, along with what most people call complex use of modes and his scale runs. This guy is a hack, just because he supposedly scored off the charts at berkelee (which is higher than a ten) people think he's god at guitar. listen to simple plan for good music and virtuoso guitar playing. nuff said."
4,liquid tension experiment with a bad vocalist,"I am an early Genesis/Yes/King Crimson fan who came to Dream Theater only recently. I love the instumental parts of this cd,but the vocals bring it down.The Lamb this is not.I still highly recommend buying it,but I prefer Liquid Tension Experiment.The insrumentalists in this band are awesome but the vocals seem melodramatic and the lyrics trite."
3,SHELLY* moon's review DBZ fans,"some of dream theater's songs are on the video (The History Of Trunks) witch is the only reason I even know about dream theater, like for instans (through her eyes) is on it at the end. And also (beyond this life)is in it in the midle of the movei when gohan fight android 17. I recemend this CD to any trunks fan and/or dragon ball Z fan, they have there good song but some of them are not really kid meteral, you can find some of dream theater's songs on the history of trunks soundtrack! I recemend this to children of the ages 10 and up.your friend, SHELLY* moon"
2,Scenes from a nightmare,"Reading the 1999 poll wich voted above album as the best album of 1999 I ran to the store and listened to it. I hoped to hear a symphonic orientated album but instead I had to look for the album in the Hard Rock section Listening to it I came to the conclusion that i liked the ""softer""parts of the album but that I hated the heavy pounding guitar work. But that is my taste. I'm more into Steve Howe or Steve Hacketts guitar style. I think i'm a little bit misled in the style of what to expect of Dream Theater. But that doesn't mean it's a bad album, i'm sure that the hard/prog/rock fans like it very much."
2,DT this,"I go to a music school. People here absolutely worship these guys, and most the guitar players in my school want to be speed shred metal guitarists like Vai and Petruci. Most of the music in Dream Theater sounds no different from guitar exercises found on their guitar instructional videos. No heart or soul, no passion, just a constant speed contest to see how fast you can play 32nd triplet arpeggios.I also never did like James LaBrie's vocals. He belongs in theater, not rock, even if it is prog rock... even Jimmy Gnecco from Ours sounds better than him.It's not a terrible album, but this in no way represents the pinnacle of DT-ness that everyone seems to be saying it is. By the pinnacle, I mean a DT album that I actually care for.Grade: D+"
2,"DT, as performed by your local church band","I have just finished my (approximately) 12th listening of this album... and I hate it just as much as the first time. Could they have played any more ponderously? This is the musical equivalent of talking down to someone.Which is *such* a shame, because the story behind the album is such a neat idea, and was meant to complement the prototype Dream Theater album, Images and Words.Why does that translate into an album that's geared, musically, towards a midwestern Baptist church-going audience? I have no idea... must just have been what was going through their minds at the time. Two beautiful ballads, and a very cool intro... but all of them bridges, and not really what we're here for.Fans of Awake, Images, and Train of Thought should pay no more than the lowest used price for this cd. It speaks volumes that DT has not created a single track since that'd belong on this album."
2,Over-indulgent,"The playing on the album is superb, however the material is totaly over-indulgent and very unaccessable. Complex for the sake of being complex. No where near as good as Falling into Infinity."
2,are they really DT?,"ok, for the guys who think jordan rudess is better than derek s. an kevin moore:he is not. he's a gerat virtuoso palyer, but he lacks any real inspiration. at least on this album. many of the tracks are boring, and they lacks that incredible power and inventive that you can hear on images and words and on awake. moreover I liked derek work on FII and on once in a live time much more. his mixture ""jazz/progressive""kind of playing gave a great power to DT. talking about the tracks, overture 1928 and strange deja-vu are great, home is OK, though is unnecessary long, I like some parts of byond this life.I won't spend any words on the spirit...and on trhough her heys...while the last track has a great arrangment work on it, but on different albums DT did teach us that when a song is 12 minutes long there's a reason, here there is not. let's hope for the next album..."
5,+*****,"This CD is great. I think that Dream Theater is one of the most talented bands producing music right now. The instraments alone are enough to sustain this album, infact, some people I know wish that there were only the instraments on this album. The lyrics in my opinion are also good. It is a modern opera set to progressive rock. The basic storyline involves a murdered girl and two brothers. It begins with a man being hypnotized and it is never clear whether the man is just a bystander, the girl reincarnated, or the surviving brother."
4,Yes great album ...,"I have only one problem with this album : the story. It's not very original. The same concept has been developped in the movie 'Dead Again'. It's shame because the music is great and Jordan is fantastic. John P shreds a lot but he's still great. I like especially the Act one with Overture 1928,Strange Deja vu,Fatal Tragedy ."
5,Impressive is the word!,"Since I got this CD, I haven't stopped talking about it! It's such a great representation of how talented Dream Theater really is. Their use of musical elements, such as polyrhythms and modulation, is amazing. I've never heard any other band as good as Dream Theater. I'm also very impressed with their making the album an entire score for a play. James LaBrie's vocal work is dynamic, yet dramatic. Great Bass work from John Myung. Impressive, inventive guitar from John Petrucci. Atmospheric keyboard and piano from Jordan Rudess. And, my favorite part of the band, Mike Portnoy, is without the most amazing drummer I've ever heard. No matter what type of music you're into, you'll find some that is great on this CD."
1,This is the worst CD I've ever heard!,"Scenes From A Memory is a effortless and sad attemp at music. For the most part it features substandard lyrics, vocals and and instumental. There is not one song that rocks. The single Home almost does but falls short. Okay, so this isn't a rock album like their previous efforts. Don't expect to find good ballads or mid-tempo songs either. Much of this album sounds the same. The vocals are very basic and safe. The instumentals, especially the keyboard and guitar are overdone and is completely unoriginal. The solo's are overextended and not arranged well. I can't believe Dream Theater made this album. If you don't believe check out the sound clips, thats the best it gets! I want to sell this CD but I'd feel guilty about ripping somebody off."
1,Major Dissapointment,"Dream Theater is my favorite metal band of any genre, but this album marks the beginning of their decline. The songs simply feel unfinished. Of course, their musicianship is outstanding, but the songwriting is weak. None of the songs grabbed me like on their previous recordings. I loved all the other albums, especially Awake, but they really dropped the ball on this one. The band seemingly has gotten bored with its earlier direction and is now directionless. Ever since they added Jordan Rudess I've felt like Portnoy has been stealing my money. The band is basically dead as the creative force it once was."
1,disappointed!,"I wanted to like Dream Theater, I really did. I'm a big Queensryche fan and my friend urged me to get this CD since if I liked Queensryche, I'd like Dream Theater. Wrong! The musicianship is excellent technically, but the songwriting is weak. If I wanted to listen to 15-minute instrumentals, I'd drag out one of my old Rush or Led Zep albums. Since buying this I've seen DT live three times (once by themselves and twice because they were playing with Queensryche) and again, they're great musically, James Labrie is an excellent vocalist, but I was bored stiff during all the long instrumental breaks. Even Labrie leaves the stage! If I could tell DT anything, I'd say shorter songs, more singing by James, and less guitar/keyboard noodling. I've never seen, or heard, such a technically excellent band that was so boring."
3,"Yes, definitely too many notes","How promising at start and what a let down over all. Until ouverture 1928 you are full of expectations of what is to come, only to end up hearing a group of great musicians being too ambitious. Some parts are great (the ooh-factor is impressive, especially on guitar and drums), but it is just not good enough to listen to for a whole album. ""Falling into infinity"" is just a better balanced album and a lot more fun to listen to. What happened to Derek Sherinian and ""Lines in the sand""? This composer input is now lacking and the new keyboard player doesn't sound like he fills it. Don't get me wrong. It is a good album, but Dream Theater can do a lot better if they just go for the songs and don't overdo it on complex storylines."
5,One of DT's finest albums,Metropolis 2 is one of DT's finest albums after IMAGES AND WORDS and AWAKE.It contains some of the best prog rock ever recorded.This album is highly recommended along with Live scenes from New York a live album from DT.
5,Excellent Concept Album,"Like many other concept albums, Metropolis II will get much better as time progresses. Similarly to Shadow Gallery's Tyranny, there is too much to digest on this album to review it fairly this soon. Well, I couldn't wait.I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed with Falling Into Infinity. Having a classical music background, I have always enjoyed compositions more than songs, of which, aside from a few flashes of brilliance, FII was primarily a collection.This album fits what I have always thought a band like this was capable of creating. It creates a strong musical theme, and even though it does take it's structure through some tempo-related and melodic twists and turns, it always stays true to it. Many people call these albums pretentious, about which, unless it would stop great prog bands from continuing these trends, I couldn't care less.Well done, Dream Theater, please continue travelling down this route. Your fans will definitely follow."
5,Exellent concept album,"Simply put: One of the best albums ever! Buy this along with I&W, Awake, SDOIT, ah hell buy all their albums! Best song is Home."
4,Prog metal at it's best!!!,By far the BEST cd this band has ever put out. If you liked IMAGES & WORDS then this is a continuation of the great music it left behind!
5,I am just plain Impressed.,"Metropolis pt.2 Scenes From a Memory is just plain Magnificient. I can easily rank it up there with The Wall, Tommy, and Dark Side of the Moon. Not only because DT's work is just as good, but the sound is similar in its variety, story, flow and scope. Much of Metropolis pt.1 is seamlessly and beautifuly integrated into the Whole Album, and the songs flow so smoothly from one to another, that when I recorded it from CD to Mini-disc, it copied as ONE TRACK!!! I am not changing it either, this Album, like Tommy or Dark Side should be listened, and experienced as One.I am not even going to try to credit the musicianship of this Rock-Opera, I have the Images..but not the Words. I will say that Jordan Rudes is a member of Dream Theater, and I hope he stays for a Long Time.Well Done!!!! This Album is too good for Radio, but I still hope the singles get air time...This Piece of Music Deserves to be Heard."
5,A Brilliant Masrepiece,"After a not so bright album, Dream Theater are back on track with a perfect masterpiece. From the first note to the final one, this album represents an exciting piece as well as a chilling mystery story. As always, Dream Theater succeed in renovating their style and demonstrating their superior technique. This is, by far, the band's best album yet. The only flaw of this album is that it ends to soon... Enjoy."
3,"Not their best work, contrary to common belief","This is a worthy sequel to Images_And_Words, but marred by less clear production than that landmark release. Yes, it's a 78min progressive rock opera, but this is not ground-breaking stuff. Too many boring bits. Also I keep hearing Rush's ""Hemispheres"" and Marillion's ""Brave"" and I wonder how unconciously the guys wanted to duplicate them. I'm a DT fan, and I'll be listening to this CD a lot in the future, but it doesn't rate an automatical across-the-board 5-stars just because the long-awaited ""Metropolis Pt II"" finally arrived. It has a great lyrical story though. 3.5 stars."
4,Very impressive,"So what if the story is not original? They're getting better with every album of shedding away excess instrumentation, and simplifying the arrangements to create a great sound. Some of these songs are the first ones I can sing along with in a while. LaBrie, Portnoy, Petrucci and Myung fantastic as always, and especially Jordan Rudess, who plays tremendously well for a keyboardist that has never been in Yes. :-)And on a side note, I think the hypnotherapist narration makes this album sound really cool with headphones on in your sleep."
5,"Incredible, start to finish","Dream Theater has returned from their short venture into mediocrity (the FII album), to produce one of the greatest albums of all time. Some have complained that it's not really ""progressive metal"", but who cares about labels? Jordan Rudess is mind-blowing, and a much better fit for the band than the FII keyboard player, and even surpassing original keyboardist Kevin Moore. I recently saw Dream Theater live, in which they played the entire Scenes From a Memory album, end-to-end, non-stop. Then they came back onstage and played for another 45 minutes. They sound as good live as on their recordings. This is a band you have to hear - and SEE - to believe."
5,What is James LaBrie doing in a band with these guys?,"I don't understand how anyone could give a masterpiece like this less than five stars. As a musician, I am, of course, forced to bow in reverence when I hear Petrucci solo, but as an avid music fan I also find the music at times exciting, saddening, and completely absorbing. It seems absolutely ridiculous to slight this album for perceived faults such as overlong solos or technical showboating; with music this startlingly original and entertaining, why cut it short?"
5,Back to form,"Well. I'm sitting here, blasting this puppy quite loudly and yes, it rocks. For those who were disappointedby FFI, Metropolis ptII proves to be a return to form for DT. From mesmerizing melodies to a fascinating and compelling storyline, this may be Dream Theater's most cohesive album yet.Oh and by the way, Rudess smokes all over this record."
3,Not the best,"I have been a fan since 1989. Each album progressed up until Falling into Infinity, I believe they need Kevin Moore back in the band. Since his departure they have never sounded the same. Never the less they are still my favorite band. The new CD is great but it's no I&W or Awake."
5,This changed my views on modern bands.,"For a long time in my life I thought that modern music was completely and utterly useless. Until my friend showed my Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. Dream Theater is now one of my favorite bands and I've looked into new types of music because of this. On the contrary to what the idiot said about Dream Theater. They can play together, they sound good notation wise, their lyrics are genius, and Mike is amazing no matter what he does."
5,dt at its best,i saw this album live before i baught it and it blew me away this album hits all levels metal and ballad if you are thinking about getting into dt buy this album it is a great starting point fir anyone and if you dont have this album get it
5,Music doesn't get any better than this...,"Well, it doesn't. This is the greatest cd of all time. After owning this cd for almost 2 years, I felt that it was about time I reviewed it! I'm not going to go into detail describing every single song because there are about 500 other reviews that do just that(and besides, i could go on for days talking about each particular song). So I'll make this review short and sweet.While many think Dream Theater are a bunch of self-indulgent show offs who don't have emotion in their music, they'd be dead wrong. Just listen to this cd. How can anyone say The Spirit Carries On isn't emotional? Just listen to that solo!! Basically, if you have doubted Dream Theater in the past, get this cd! It WILL change your opinion about them! And the debut performance by Jordan Rudess is simply stunning, especially on tracks like One Last Time and The Dance Of Eternity.After buying this cd, do yourself a favor and buy Awake. It's their 2nd best!"
5,Gods of Progressive Rock,"The most amazing, mind-blowing, gut-wrenching record I have ever listened to! This album defines the word perfect. In every sense this album is perfect. Since buying it two months ago it has never left the cd player. Rock on guys! You dont just make music to bang to but also musig for the soul."
5,Dream Theater Never Disappoints! Highly Recommended...,"Dream Theater is in their element when they write conceptual material and this work is no exception. I've been listening to it for a few days now and need to listen about 100 more times to take it all in because there is so much going on. The good news is, the more you listen to it, the more you like it. As you can tell by most of these reviews, it is an album well worth buying. The only negative reviews I have seen seem to be by frustrated, jealous musicians. Hats off to the two guys that produced this monster and also to Eastwest-Elektra for letting these boys do their creative ""thing"" uninhibited. Can't wait to see this show live!"
3,78 minutes of 2 styles....,"Just to let you know where I'm coming from, I think ""Images and Words"" is amazing, ""Awake"" less so and ""Falling Into Infinity"" is under-rated by many core fans based on posted comments.The problem is with the new 2style approach: hyper-speed and boringly slow. I don't hear nearly enough ""dynamic"" that DT is famous for. People buying it should realize that they may be buying great metal, but the progressive side is only filler on this CD."
2,"Starts off strong, but . . .","The first six tracks on this album are great. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The vocalist just does not do it for me. If you're thinking about getting into Dream Theater, buy AWAKE first."
2,Two stars thanks to lyrical indulgence,"Well,the guys managed to refrain their overplaying a little bit and focus on the songs, instead of their playing. That was a plus, and this album really shines.On the other thand, they transfered all their traditional indulgence in playing to the lyrics, I mean, plot. It is confused, arrogant, boring, using some kind of language similar to English... Really obnoxious. And of course, LaBrie's voice is still hard to bear."
2,The usual too much of not enough,"2 1/2Another in a large pile of overrated, relatively ambitious DT discs that only manages to secure a few worthwhile tracks amidst the generic hard rock excess and bloated ballads."
1,I pretty much hated it-- Utter disaapointment for an old fan,"I was surprised to see such a high ranking of this album. I thought it was trash by the time I was halfway through it, the first day of owning it. I don't like the departure from the original style of the first 3 CDs. This album ranges from sappy crap with horrible lyrics to nu-metal riffs that belong in radio pop metal. What makes this album desirable to the other reviewers, I have no idea. Maybe they didn't like Dream Theater before this so they didn't know what the first CDs were like.I hate the theme of this album as well and I think the story is useless, horrible, and delivers and ""in your face"" spiritual message or total garbage that makes me want to visit the restroom. I wish Dream Theater would have stuck with the original format where they were absolutely *amazing,* and the songwriting was second to none."
2,"Valiant try, but didn't do it for me","Metropolis Part 1 (from Images And Words)contained 13 minutes of great music. Unfortunately, Metropolis Part 2 (this cd) ONLY contains about 13 minutes of great music."
2,Booooring !,"DT have lowered their standards. Seems that they think they can just 'jam' an album (like the LTE stuff) without writing any real quality stuff. Production standards have also apparently been lowered. Metal guys should NEVER produce their own albums, as the ears of these musicians are usually totally shot !"
3,Hmm... They Have Done Alot Better - A 14 y.o's review,"OK, well... I'm not sure whether I like it or not. When I bought it I was looking for Images and Words/Train Of Thought type CD, instead I got alot of mellow acoustic songs, to me this isn't Progressive Metal. Nonetheless it has a few good songs on it that you can't help but be amazed at Dream Theater's talent. Mike Portnoy is amazing, Petrucci is a freak, these guys are total masters. But seriously, I much prefer Train 'Of Thought' to this, but it just depends on what music you're looking for. I'm amazed at how Dream Theater's sound changes so much throughout all their albums. Dream Theater fans I suggest you get this, I'm not incinuating it's a bad album, just it is not what I was looking for."
5,UNREAL,This may be the BEST DT album- if your new to the band- START HERE!!!! This kicks butt!!! WHat an amazing album!!!!
5,Warning,"I used to have a job, a family lots of friends and some fun hobbies. Then I bought this CD. I don't sleep, eat or do anything but listen to this. All I do is sit and listen to this CD. All I want to do is sit and listen to this CD.Please don't help me."
3,"Not gripping, but beautiful language","Much of the language in this novel beautiful, but other parts of the book failed to hold my attention.I appreciated the handy chart of characters at the beginning of the book, showing how they relate to one another. I found that I referenced this often. But shouldn't the text of the novel itself do a sufficient job of explaining the relationships of characters to one another?I felt as if I was taking a peak into someone else's world, and as quickly as I was invited in, I was cast out again, without any real resolution or deeper understanding.The most redeeming qualities of this novel were style of the language and the emphasis put on the struggles and burdens on women in Algeria in the mid 1900s."
4,Nostalgic and insightful,"Enjoyed the simple and down home feel to this album. A mix of country, folk and humor in these original songs."
1,waste of money,"I dont know if the other two reviewers watched the same dvd i did but this was a total waste of money. For one thing there was no real instruction on breathing just a view of this man breathing and some poor anatomy computer graphics. Second of all this man goes into a whole health diatribe on how breathing helps you with your health , all the while he is completely over weight.If your looking for some pointless eastern slant philosophy with a pure touch of new agey nonsense, then you found your dvd. If you'd like some real world breathing techniques then spend your money elsewhere!"
3,"First track great, others, just ok","While a few of the tracks on this sounded great, most of them sounded a little to fairy tale-ish for me. 'Road to Camelot' was my favorite, and probably the only one I go back to and listen to."
4,Lovely Music,"This is a good addition to one's Celtic music collection. Enaid, which is David and Diane Arkenstone as a team, make excellent music together."
5,Mystical Tranquility,I adore this CD!! The perfect music to decompress on the ride home after a stressful day at work!! I'm giving it to friends as Christmas gifts!
3,"OK, but not teething biscuits at all.",These are tasty crunchy little cookies. I liked them more than the 1 year old did. They are a little sweet and crumbly for babies I think. Maybe better for young school kids to put in their lunch box.
2,"Energetic performances, bad sound","I agree with the first reviewer, I've had this since 1992 (cheap CD from Italy) and the sound is unnecessarily bad, though Hit the Road Jack and I Believe to my Soul to name a couple have excellent performances."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"This is one of the better books that I've read recently. I started reading one night and couldn't stop until I had read the whole book. The characters were so well written. Joanna and Guy are two people deserve the happiness they get from each other. This book made me cry at one point, even if you know that everything has to work out in the end."
2,Overly dramatic!!,"If you like weepy, beleaguered heroines, brooding, nasty (at least at first) leading men and overly dramatic writing, this is the book for you. The writing reminds me of the 70's serial romance genre where the hero treats the heroine poorly and she's so pure and good she turns him around by the end. The turn-around happens near the middle of this book, however, the point remains: a hero who is mean and rude to the heroine from the onset, even if seemingly justified, is flawed throughout. I believe the dialogue needs to be clever to convey the animosity while keeping that layer of civility. Several authors achieve this wonderfully but since it was not acheived in this novel, I never warmed up to the hero....(or the heroine, for that matter because she was so darn weepy).I believe modern romance readers prefer heros and heroines with strong characters and witty dialog....this book falls short on both accounts."
1,Terrible,"I couldn't even finish this book. The characters wereridiculous; any characterization that was done was apparently doneonly to allow the characters to fight more. The dialogue was atrocious, and I'm not sure the book's editor even read it. For example, after the main characters first meet, they fight for what could take, in the real world, five minutes, until the heroine (I use the term loosely) storms out. The hero then states that for the TWENTY minutes she was in the room, he was enthralled. Very poorly done."
5,what a good book,The book held my interest so that I didn't want to put it down. It had a good plot and I cared about the characters. A really nice book.
4,Enjoyable,"There were a lot of things I really liked about this book. One thing I've noticed about this author, however, is that she does not give very good attention to detail. Getting details right is essential to the credibility of a historical novel. For example, the child Miles has a dog, a Golden Retriever. This is supposed to be Regency England; Golden Retrievers were not established as a breed until the mid nineteenth century. Criticizing things like this may seem nit picky, but it's these things that ruin the experience by pulling me out of the story, and keep it from being a keeper."
2,This was a between book.,"I couldnt get into this book. I have yet to finish it. However, I loved the series that it was mixed with."
3,A quick read...,"This was not Evanovich's best, but it was ok. I am a huge Stephanie Plum fan, but it was hard to buy into the supernatural element."
3,Nutone could have done much better.,"Power head works well. But, the lights aim too high and they are not shielded from the top, making them distracting.The storage bag is useless.The hose works, but is very flimsy and I do not expect it to last very long. In fact my first order arrived with a damaged hose that had to be returned.The wands are very good. The other tools are OK."
4,Works for intended purpose but no more than that.,"This book is fairly straightforward, but not very in-depth or detailed. It is more of an overview than I expected for a college level physiology book. Supplemental material is often needed for a more comprehensive understanding of concepts."
5,Gorgeous!!!,"Oh my goodness, these earrings and pendant are sooo pretty. The Sterling Silver really looks more like white gold/platinum and the purple amethyst gems are beautiful. Very satisfied!"
4,My son 13 year old read it,"The book is very short but with very good message of Perseverance.My son read it and said its motivational to live your dreams.To fight against obstacle, and persist for your goals. Step by step.FHW"
4,Good but not excelent!!,"This is a good book. It goes straight to the point... good motivational thoughts! However, it is so short (36 half pages) that it seems rather a short essay than a book. I would have wanted to see some more anedoctes and more biography from Michael Jordan's life.Overall, a good book."
2,Michael Jordan,I Can't Accept Not Trying: Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of ExcellenceThis book is expensive for the state it is in.
4,"great deal , great product","This item was shipped promptly. The fabric is soft and actually to me felt like better quality than the set I just returned that set me back a little under $180.00. I would have rated this product 5 stars, but it hasn't been put to the real test of wear and tear yet as my baby is not due for a few weeks, but it did wash well for its initial washing *(cold water on normal cycle)."
5,A Real Jem,This has to be one of the best instructional videos on childbirth out today. I had the opportunity to watch both tapes twice while spending several weeks in the hospital waiting for the birth of our son. Not only did I learn an amazing amount from Sheri but I laughed out loud so often the nurses would stop and watch with me. Sheri answers all those questions you wonder about and covers everything you and your partner need to know --from A to Z. A true Jem and what a gift to give someone.
5,Don't go into labour without watching this class,"The moment we watched this class, we knew, we didn't have to worry about childbirth anymore. 5 1/2 hours of essential information - and all the things we didn't know we didn't know! We became childbirth experts. Sheri, thank you for sharing this information in such an easy to understand and humorous way.."
1,Not what expected!,Have read books much better than this video. Not enough variety and could have been much more informative with various settings.
2,Not for those looking forward to natural childbirth.,"Sheri's view of childbirth is a painful, intervention packed event. Someone looking to learn what horrible levels of pain to expect and what things will to be done to them will find that info here. If you are trying to learn about strong women having powerful, beautiful births look elsewhere, they are out there. Available here at Amazon is ""Birth Day"" which features a Mexican Midwife giving birth surrounded by family. Available at midwiferytoday.com ""Birth Into Being: The Russian Waterbirth Experience "" is extraordinary. While neither are childbirth education classes, you can learn a ton more about the truth of birth. Read Dr. Sear's ""Birth Book"" and Henci Goer's ""The Thinking Woman's Guide To A Better Birth"" availble at Amazon.com to educate yourself much more than this video can."
5,Learning about childbith while laughing,"As a Labor and Delivery nurse for the past 20 years, I was pleasantly surprised to see these tapes were as thorough as they could be concerning labor and childbirth. Sheri delivers the information with humor and wit as well as an incredible base of knowledge.I recommend these tapes to anyone stuck on bedrest or without the time to attend a formal class.They also make a great gift for expextant parents."
1,Bitterly Dissapointing,"The book reads like a paean of love for all things Anatolian and Caucasian, and is positively dripping in its oily bias for these regions. Perhaps a title like ""A Complete Guide"" might be a little misleading in light of the author's evident disdain for city-made Persian goods, and a complete dismissal of Turkish curvilinear rugs altogether.Its technical analysis reads like a poorly prepared undergraduate work, drawing conclusions that are risible at best, embarrassingly self-indulgent and irresponsible at worst; the untried conjectures of a dilettante. The text does serve some small function as an emetic, however.P.R.J. Ford's ""Oriental Carpet Design"" is vastly superior to this tired and dusty old dinosaur."
3,Cute but ..,"The shoe was quite cute, not cheap looking but it gaped open at the sides when I walked, probably because my foot is narrow."
3,"People, please do some research.","This is not a review of this CD, but rather a look into the insight of the ignorant and stupid. Like my subject so gently puts it, you people need to do some research on this band. This album is the third in Saliva's back catalogue. This is no sophomore outing. Just because they, like most other bands, were indie before mainstream does not make there repitoire smaller. Please, think twice being for getting ignorant. This also applies to Godmack and their 3rd album Awake."
1,What's This! MetalHeads Don't Need Love Songs!!,"It's obvious that Saliva has nothing to say, they keep repeating the same sentence every now and then, and guess what..why should a rock band sing about women and love all the time?? Don't You think that Saliva should enter the POP Music world? The lyrics are so cheap and meaningless, actually this CD isn't worth the 1 star even! In Conclusion, If you're looking for REAL metal music...then don't waste your money on this CD!"
2,"Boring cliche ""rock""","I'm just gonna say it... these guys ...I don't listen to them that much, but I've definently heard enough of their music to come to the conclusion that they are just another cliched ""rock"" band. The guys basically define mainstream; it's all here: predictable lyrics, basic riffs and stupid MTV music videos. These songs are boring as hell; they are all formulatic, predictable, and simple cliche. Take ""Always"" for example; this is seriously one of the worst ""rock"" songs I have heard in a LONG time. Every time I see the stupid video on MTV, I can't stop watching it because it litterally ... so much. Anyway, don't buy into this ... and go pick up a copy of Queens of the Stone Age, Rancid, Rage Against the Machine, etc."
5,"If Heaven were a CD, this would be IT!","AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!... What more can I say?? Well I could say that I never thought it was even possible to out do Every Six Seconds, but Back Into Your System has done just that!! From tracks like ""Always"" to ""Weight Of the World"" to ""Raise Up"" to ""Rest in Pieces"" this CD hits you hard and never lets up! I have waited months for Back Into Your System and it was WELL worth the wait! What are YOU waiting for?? GO BUY IT!!!"
4,Solid disc all the way around,"This is a very solid disc! It has a fair mix of heavy, street fighting tunes and a few slower, laid back songs. The thing that surprised me the most was the lyrical build and musical build of the songs. Not bad at all! In fact, almost shocking for this heavier caliber of music. I know some will disagree, but the flagship song on the disc is ""Rest In Pieces"". It tells of a broken relationship and the wish to just rest, even if it's in pieces. This is a true rock ballad any band would be proud of. If it doesn't hit the Billboard Hot 100 and go into the Top 10, something is definitely wrong.Nice work guys! For your next album work on a couple of speed rock songs. As Emeril says, ""Kick It Up a Notch!"""
1,"Kill me, please","...Now, if it had been my cd, I would have shattered it into a million pieces before the first song was over. This is just MIND NUMBBING!! On top of that, thier lead singer looks like he just crawled out of a dumpster, found some dead gang banger, put on his clothes, and decided he was going to try and be more incredibly trashy and brain dead than Andrew W.K. This and anything remotely like it is complete garbage. Avoid at all costs. It fact, if you ever hear someone playing this in their car or at thier house, please be a good samaritain and put them out of their misery."
1,not happy,I Bought This Cd Was New And Factory Sealed But the cd cover was broken great album other wise the hassle
5,"More ""Adult"" Angst Found Here","Scott was plenty angry on the first two CD's, but he seemed to mellow out on this release, and there's nothing wrong with that. For every time the band has a tremendous riff to hammer us with - ""Superstar II,"" ""Raise Up"" or ""Pride"" - they've got a pretty riff for Scott to gush over, like ""Back In Your System,"" ""Rest in Pieces"" or ""Storm."" Overall, the best song on the CD is predictably where they put aside their strengths of clunky electrics in favor of pianos and oddly strummed acoustics: ""Famous Monsters"" rarely rises from its subdued tones, and is thus a great change of pace. A more polished release with higher-pitched guitars than the first two efforts, this CD is sure to please fans of palatable alternative metal."
3,Bring Back Blackbone!,"I've followed Josey and Chris since their Blackbone days in Memphis. The guys are really talented and I love their style and attitude. However, this disc does not begin to compare with the stellar effort on Every Six Seconds. Doperide is better than every song on this disc. The boys need to bring back the heavy groove of the B-Bone days. I'm tempted to give this 2 stars...because I know they're capable of much more."
1,ewie,"When I first heard ""Always"" and ""Rest in Pieces"", i fell in love with Saliva, so i decided to buy the cd- BIG MISTAKE! The rest of the songs, excluding""Always"", ""Rest in Pieces"" and maybe ""All because of you"" are basically the same song over and over again with Josie Scott telling us how wonderful he is. The songs are not imaginative or even tolerable. I think that, judging from their singles, they are capable of SO much better than those stupid ""heavy rock"" anthems they kept cranking out. It almost seemed like they just threw together a bunch of songs because they needed to fill up the cd. Save yourself from music-induced suicide and don't buy this trendy cd. Just listen to their gems on the radio."
3,Same Old Same Old,The CD starts out with a blast but goes down hill quickly. The lead track really rocks. It has great sound and makes you want to move. The rest of the CD sounds like every other song from every other band trying to make it these days. I would not put this in the trash bin but at the same time (other than the lead track) it would not be in the everyday rotation of my play list.
5,best cd of 2002!,"back into your system is a much better album then every six seconds.saliva puts out a new awesome cd.songs like always,weight of the world,superstar 2,back into your system, and rest in pieces are all awesome and great songs.everything else is good too.overall saliva's back into your system cd is one that you will always love!"
4,Nicely Done!,"This album had to be one of the biggest surprises of my life. I didn't expect much from Saliva. I never liked the lead singers voice much, and the stuff from their last album seemed so cheesy.However, I was wrong about Saliva.This album is outstanding. It's rock music at its finest. Besides the insanely idiotic intro with the little kid dialing up the lead singer and telling him he wants to be a ""Rock star like you!!!"", this album rocks with the best of em.My favorite song is without a doubt the title track."
1,WAL-MART METAL BULLSH*T!,"God, these guys are pathetic poseurs. Every album they've released (I don't know about the first album) rips off a different band each time. This CD is a knockoff of Nickelback, yet another pathetic ""wannabe grunge but can't be Eddie Vedder"" band. Out of all the Saliva albums, this is the worst. One star? Come on, ONE STAR? It doesn't deserve this. This deserves -9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 stars! ""Always"" has a bunch of s**tty lyrics to it:""I love you, I hate you, I can't live without you...""What a bunch of pathetic bullcrap, but wait! We have the song ""Rest In Pieces"", a bunch of garbage stirred up and delivered to the pop radio stations. $ellout$!I can't believe that bands these days are copying other bands' albums and pasting the albums as their own."
2,unoriginal,josey scott is a capable vocalist and they have ok instrumentals but Saliva is nothing new or original.
5,The Best Romance CD EVER,"Featuring 14 songs, all of them ballads of love, this CD is a little known GEM!Each song expresses different stages of love, from hope to heartbreak in a manner which is touching and mellow, yet still subtle.If you've seen the movie Bad Boys, you probably know at least one song from this little known CD. ""I'll Never Find Someone Like You"" appeared both in the movie and on the soundtrack.Songs like ""If Love Feels So Good (Why Does It Hurt So Bad)"" and ""One Mile From Paradise"" express pain and regret, while ""Moment In Time"" reminds us that no matter how bad something might feel, ""keep this in mind... it's only a moment in time."" The concluding track, ""Because of You"" exclaims, ""Because of you, my world has changed. I thank you for the love and the joy you bring."" Play this song for that special someone, she'll be swept off her feet."
4,he's coming back,Keith Martin already came out with his new cd and debuted it in the philippines a few weeks ago. his first single that dropped is called 'love of my life'.
4,Excellent Intro to Standards-based DOM Scripting,"Having a bit of knowledge of javascript, but not knowing exactly how to integrate DHTML without breaking the site -- this book offers a simplistic approach to convey the techniques used and recommended by accessibility professionals and the W3C.The only drawback after having started to work with DOM Scripting on the job is that I need more complex examples."
4,Good intro to manipulating the DOM with Javascript,"Very easy to follow, good explanation of the DOM. The author did a good job of using examples and building on them as new concepts were introduced. Also did a good job of encouraging little snippets of reuseable code. Although he did a pretty reasonable intro upfront to Javascript in general, it would help if a reader had some programming background (especially in object-oriented concepts). Recommended."
4,Very clear and practical,I recommend this book for people who care to write high quality javascript code. Using this book I learned new techniques for manipulating (X)HTML documents in a very powerful way.
4,Great resource for JavaScript newbies,"This is a great book to help those looking to break into the world of JavaScript. I had a little tutorial experience from Lynda.com before reading this book and it clarified a lot of unanswered questions that Lynda left me with. It presents a clear and concise picture of what JavaScript does. It also helps that everything is written in simple terms, when he presents a piece of coding he details all the activities he is going to do through JavaScript and then executes. It truly helped me make sense of JavaScript."
3,decent book,It has the basic needs of a book. i learned a little. i really actually didn't read it. been to busy.
1,Did I have a stroke?!,"This book just makes me soooo glad that I can do the same things with Flash. The more I read, the more I felt like I must have had a stroke. Just when you think you're on the edge of grasping a block of code, Mr. Keith extends the code a few more pages for testing/checking purposes, because it needs fine-tuning, etc. The material is definitely for people who think like programmers - not designers - extremely difficult to follow. I hate javascript even more now after struggling through this book. I have no idea why anyone would rather write brain-twisting code for a simple animation than create the same thing in Flash with minimal code required!"
3,Good Introduction,I consider this book an excellent primer and one of the most accurate compilations for approaching DOM and JS. My intention for purchasing the book was for deep knowledge and that's where I was let down. It does just a bit more than scratch the surface on the topic and is most accurate. Excellent book for beginners and students wanting to understand the correct way to approach DOM and JS. I would not recommend for advanced readers looking to really exercise their ability on the topics.
5,The best intro to JavaScript for designers,"This book is perfect for front end developers with little to no JavaScript or DOM experience. Jeremy Keith is one of the top proponents for unobtrusive, semantic, and gracefully degrading JavaScript in the world. A must buy for anyone who ever needs to use or learn JavaScript and the Document Object Model."
5,Nobody's Baby,"I have watch this movie over and over on my old vhs, good enuff to order as needed I think. I first seen this movie on my satelite t.v. I would refreash my tapes as needed. Fun & lovingly to watch over and over and over."
4,great service,I ordered this movie because I watched this with my son 10 years ago and We both enjoyed it. However the DVD wouldn't play. I contacted the seller and was instantly refunded my money. Great service is hard to find.
5,Great movie :),I saw this on one of the movie channels over the weekend and fell in love with it. I love the story line Gary Oldman is great in it and Skeet I always adore. Highly recommended.
4,Gary oldman is hilarious,This movie is good not great but if your a fan of Gary Oldman you will like it alot. He can play anything or anybody. This movie he is just a crazy nut ( funny) guy. First you do not even realize it is him then he has a hemroid problem that only chapstick helps but the move is based on Skeet ulrich always running into bad luck. His bud is Gary oldman and skeet ends up with a baby he rescued has no idea what to do with it then falls in love with it and everything seems to just happen bad luck in a funny way. Good movie
4,a good learner's dictionary,"This is a great Spanish-Spanish dictionary for students of Spanish at the intermediate to advanced level, because it was designed for people learning the language. So the definitions are written more simply and they seem to have included the more commonly used words. I would recommend it for people who are trying to get away from using bilingual dictionaries only."
4,A very cute case indeed!,I bought this for my mom as a christmas present. She absolutely loved it. It is made very well and is super fashionable. The only downside is that it isnt big enough for more than your computer and mouse. You have to carry the Plug seperately. It does offer a good level of protection if you are travelling and want to just have something cute to put your laptop in and keep it safe in your carry on.
1,Made in China,"I ordered this Fram air filter for my Crossfire SRT-6, which has a Mercedes engine. To my surprise, the filter said ""Made in China."" Who wants a Chinese filter for a Mercedes engine? Why don't they just charge a dollar or two more and make them in the USA like they used to? So far as I am concerned, it is not worth saving peanuts to buy something made in China when American and European alternatives are available for slightly more. This is the last Fram product I will buy.P.S. The filter doesn't fit the SRT-6 model, contrary to the cross-reference on Amazon. It only fits the regular Crossfire."
2,Bluetooth is crippled,"The bluetooth capabilities of this phone are severely crippled.Only headset and hands-free is supported.It is not possible to connect it to a computer through a bluetooth adapter or have a phone-to-phone connection.To connect it to a PC, a direct USB cable and a Samsung software package is required."
5,Swann and Flanders,"This 3 CD set has satire, social and political commentary and catchy music all at its best. One of the recordings unfortunately doesn't have as good sound quality as I would like but the content is hilarious and poignant. There is a wart hog who is shunned by animal society and a cannibal boy who refuses to eat people. The wompom song extolls this imaginary plant with the same gusto that current day herbalists push tea tree extract. There are more wonderful songs than I can describe. I heartily recommend this CD compilation."
5,Marching Song of the Underground Resistance Movement,"I remember how much i loved ""Hat"" and ""Another Hat"" when i was in my teens.Still love 'em.And there's even more to love on these discs, because each one apparently contains *all* of the appropriate show, rather than ""highlights"".And the third disc includes that wonderful morbid song, ""20 Tons of TNT"".Flanders and Swann's forte was literate (and often literary) banter and straight-faced genteel musicomical anarchy.After the afore-mentioned ""20 Tons"", i'd have to say that my favourite song here is Flanders' nrrative piece detailing the circumstances behind the writing of ""Greensleeves""..."
5,British humour at its best,"When I started out as a teacher of English, I had the most wonderful colleague as a mentor -- when she retired she gave me three LPs with much of what is on these CDs, and it must be one of the best gifts I have ever been given. Practically all of it makes me smile or laugh out loud (although I must admit that some, like The Armadillo and Slow Train, make me so melancholy that I can just feel my lower lip tremble and my eyes fill up). How can you beat lines like ""Hail to thee, blithe Wompom"", or ""The English are moral, the English are good / And clever, and modest, and misunderstood""? I find they make great listening exercises for my teenaged students as well -- they consider it ancient, but incredibly funny!"
5,Realistic Perspective,"An excellent review and analysis of the ""end times"". A realistic bibilical approach to an emotional, anticipated and complex series of events. We are getting closer to His return each day with time between events getting shorter.Shalom in His Grace and Torah!Gary"
3,Vater Power 5B,"I got 6 pair of these for $4.35 per pair through Amazon, free shipping. That was a bargain for 5B nylons...With that said, these are not better than Vic Firth Extreme 5BNs, in my opinion. The wood is just not as solid, and the VFs are noticeably more balanced. The VFs chip, but these sliver and peel..What I do like is that the Vaters are longer than any other 5Bs, and the tips are oval shaped. Tough to beat VF quality..At $4.35 per pair the Vaters do compete, even at $6 they would. At $7.89 though, I'd buy the VF x5BN's for $0.60 more."
3,"Seems nice, but wrong categorizing..","When we searched to buy a fan, we purposely looked for one with a remote control. This fan was categorized as a fan that brings a remote, HOWEVER.. it does NOT bring a remote.Other than the mistake on their part, it seems like a pretty decent fan."
2,Good Work...Could Be Better,"Smith does an excellent job of providing a concise summary of the events that lead to the Binion trial, the most notorious criminal trial in Las Vegas'colorful history.However, he falls short in providing insight not already avilable in the archives of this story appearing elsewhere on the World Wide Web. In addition, character and event analysis fall woefully short of expectations, especially those of us familiar with Smith's other works.You will enjoy this book if you are vaguely familiar with the trial,and want details. If, however, you know a lot about this case already, you will be disappointed.The author does categorically and persuasively state his opinion of this case, which may take some of you by surprise. Sadly, that is the only major new revalation of this book."
4,a good handbook,"this book is a good handbook, very pratical for people who are not used to the credibility notion. good for public relation students too."
3,The Spencer Tracy Legacy,This is an interesting documentary based on the value of its being a tribute to Spencer Tracy by Katherine Hepburn. It was produced for public television in 1986 and is interesting because of the people involved and is a valuable piece of history. It is also a bit slow moving and drags in parts. Katherine's letter to Spencer at the end drags on way too long! It meant a lot to her though. I'm glad I saw it.
3,disappointed,"Somewhere along the line Lillian Byrd seems to have lost most of her sense of humor. One of the things I enjoyed about the first two books is that Lil didn't seem to take herself too seriously.Although the book is well-written, it is not one I recommend strongly."
3,"Good, but not thier best","The much anticipated new release is not like anything GBS has ever done before. It seems they have left their Canadian roots, and succumbed to American Pop Culture. It's difficult hearing the great sound of GBS overshadowed by a drum kit, especially snare and hi-hat. That's not their style, not their sound. Not to say the whole album is like that, but the majority of the album seems as if they tried to ""Americanize"" their sound. If you are a GBS fan, then you need to get the album to add to your collection, but if you are looking for the ""toe-tapping, get-out-of-your-seat"" sound that is GBS, you won't find it on this album. Sea of No Cares does not emit the energy of Turn or Road Rage. If you are new to GBS or want to get the full experience, then I would highly recommend Road Rage, and hold off buying this one until a later date."
3,This is GBS best album,This is the best album by Great Big Sea for one reason and thats Sea Of No Cares. Finally a great origional song.
3,"uneven effort, trying to be too radio-friendly","I'm very fond of Great Big Sea, and I have all their albums, but when this one came out, I found I didn't like it as much as their earlier work. Too many of the songs sound overly-produced and too radio-friendly. Instead of being true to their music, it sounds a bit like they sold out. The mix on the sound is horrible, too. I have to lower my bass settings on my stereo to play this CD because there's too much bass in it. The first three songs are terribly bland, and ""Scolding Wife"" finally recaptures some of the wonderful Great Big Sea sound that I love, but the drumming is so loud that you can't make out some of the voices!!! Who mixed this thing, an amateur? The rest of the songs are better, with ""Yarmouth Town"" being particularly a fun piece, but it seems that after getting better album after album, this is a big step backwards."
2,Lackluster at best,"Having been a fan since I first heard GBS in the states back in 1997, I've been a huge fan. I just have to shake my head (or at least shrug) at the latest attempt. Sure, they include the same formula of mixing originals with traditionals, but sometimes that isn't enough when you start adding a ""pop"" element. The new sound they attempt on songs like ""Sea of No Cares"" and ""Clearest Indication"" does not fit them. They need to have not toyed with their formula of perfection.On the positive side, songs like ""Scolding Wife"" and ""One True Way"" hearken back to UP or PLAY. All in all, not a bad pop/rock album, but it's not good for Great Big Sea.Another thing missing from this album is the pure energy that emitted from their earlier work. They probably didn't focus on making a ""good-timing"" record this time around. It's all just too clinical. Go listen to ""Play"", then listen to this one and tell me it's the same group!"
5,A New Great Big Sea Fan,"Recently on PBS I saw the last few minutes of a concert of Great Big Sea performing in Canada. I did not catch the entire show and hope my local PBS station runs it again. I have been aware of Great Big Sea and have listened to their music samples , yet was not smart enough to buy their CD's until now. I was so impressed with the talent, energy, and range of music these guys play! Being half Norwegian and half Irish, every traditional song touched me very deeply and GBS's own songs are the best I've heard. I have played 'Sea of No Cares' more times than I can count and have not yet tired of any song. These men are talented and they remain so connected to their heritage. I admire them for keeping the unique music of the Canadian Maritime Provinces alive. Great work, gentlemen. I look forward to each and every new CD, since I've already purchased every CD I can get my hands on! ..."
4,New Genre,"I found this album while shopping in a Borders store in OKC. It was playing over the speakers in the music department. I fell in love with the first few songs, but little did I know when I bought the CD that it was Celtic. I now love Celtic music. I think the album is great, and I think it is great that Borders carries such great and diverse music.Thanks~Jessica"
1,Not all reviews are worth their weight,"I may be the only one to do this.I purchased this cd because of the reviews and reading about Coco Montoya, I was ready to be dazzled or at least be able to enjoy what I was listening to.I appreciate that he was with Albert Collins and John Mayall but I found this cd to be like a lot of solo artists music in the 70's, over produced, no identity, no real soul, almost faceless...I wouldnt even classify this as blues.I tried I gave it four listens but by the second or third song I wasnt listening anymore, so it just didnt catch my attention. Maybe I expected too much or my tastes are so different, but I really wanted to like this cd.Just my opinion."
2,An album among others...,"This is inferior to ""Ya think I'd know better"". Montoya is a good guitar player but none of his solo albums are equally good as John Mayall's ""Wake up call"" on which Montoya was a part. This release won't be remembered when it's time to sum up the musical efforts in this genre. ""Suspicion"" is alright, but it's not exciting in any way. Believe me, there are thousands of albums just like this one!"
5,A Must Have For Coco Fans!!,"This album is my favorite Coco album, right along with his first. One great blues rocker after another, with one or two smooth ballads to change it up a bit. And the sound is superb!! Excellent production. Coco sings and plays like no other. As for the much griped about ""Casting My Spell On You"" on this album, I too was put off a bit--thought it was corny. But then I realized that it's just a Cajun, zydeco type song, so he's just paying tribute to that kind of music. It's just a goof-off song, so let him have some fun! You can tell the band is tongue-in-cheek on it, the way the piano player flattens a note with his pitch modulator in the middle of his solo--obviously you can't do that on a real piano!Besides after that song, Coco knocks you out with a tremendous Motown-sounding soul rocker with ""Need Your Love in My Life"". The sound will blow you away!Get this album!!!"
3,Questionable,"It has been more than 7 years when I first read this book, and it has been 4 years since I wrote my review on Amazon[.com]. First of all, I will say some of the things addressed in the book are real. For example, can evil spirits insert thoughts into our mind? From all the pastors (who I know have experiences in spiritual warfares) I'd asked, the answer is yes. However, it doesn't mean that we should believe in it wholeheartedly. After all, it is the Bible which contains the only infallible Word. My recommendation is to read it with caution. If Holy Spirit within you tell you otherwise, you should listen."
1,"Response to March 25, 2001","A hearty bravo to you; I couldn't have summized it better than you. To tell everything, Ms. 'Rebecca Brown's' background shows that not only are her claims false which investigation uncovers, but also reveals her wacky and crazed personal history during the years of the book's writing, both of which are able enough to finish discrediting any actual merit. Her undeniably untrue account is an unfortunate and deranged faery tale by a woman with real problems."
4,Warfare for Christians,"This is an excellent book. I read this and its sequal several years ago and it opened my eyes a great deal as far as witchcrafts, cults, etc are concerned. It encouraged me to be aware of the things of the spirit and to seek more knowledge. I encourage every Christian to read this."
4,Interestingly different,Some far fetched things in here. Very interesting book but I'm still searching to see how truthful everything is. Read with caution but it's very intense
5,CONFIRMATION,"I cant put this book down...I have had many questions about these things for years in my own life that have occured, and God has confirmed each one of them.....I recommend this book for anyone in this ministry, or going into it or just for answers and confirmation"
3,Hmmm...,"Be strong in scripture before you read this. I would not recommend this for children, young adults in the Lord.You need to be educated in scripture to make your own judgments.I probably would not recommend this book-it is really ""deep."""
3,read but with great discernment,"The strength of this book lies in it's emphasis on prayer, discernment in spiritual warfare and disclosure of some significant satanic tactics. Its weakness is in describing power-encounters with the enemy allowed through underdeveloped strategy over against systematically dealing with whatever gives him any advantage whatsoever. The evil one always has a reason as to why he can influence anyone. Those reasons--""footholds""-- are our problem. Once dealt with, he has nothing to work with. Power encounters will still happen now and again, but those who know the decisive and stunning victory of Calvary over the evil one will, like Jesus, make short work of the enemies nonsense."
1,Yet another piece of trash,"*sigh* Yet another attempt by the psycho-fundies to take away a pagan's rights to belief. You want a conspiracy? Look no further than your local fundamentalist church. If you feel you must read this, at least read Scott Cunningham's ""The Truth About Witchcraft Today"" to get an even balance on research."
1,he came to set the captives free,I can't really give this book an accurate star star rating because although alot of the information in the book sounds far fetched Dr.Brown is able to back up an impressive amount with scripture. My suggestion is if you read this book don't stop there. Research the author and her sources.
5,A Must Read for All,"I found the book scary at first, but could not put it down. Highly recommended for all. I gained valuable knowledge on how satan works, especially by trying to control your thoughts. However, I found certain things a bit suspect, such as how demon's can enter a Born Again Christian. To my knowledge, once one is saved and serving, demons are unable to possess that person. When Elaine (so what if they use other names) was saved, demons should not have had access to her. Surely once one confesses their sins and is born again, they receive the Holy Spirit.I heard that in a later book (not sure which book) Rebecca Brown admits to making certain faults in this book, and that Elaine had fallen back into her old ways. Please inform me if I have been misinformed about the above info.As for the ""Anti"" group as well as all the misled satanists, JESUS still loves you. God Bless to All"
1,A hoax - this shouldn't even be for sale,"If you are thinking of buying this, please do your research. This is a hoax, pure and simple. None of it is true. Don't be taken in."
1,Total Fraud,"Good read for a laugh, but anyone who does the slightest research on the author will find out its a complete fraud, kind of sad to see a so called christian cashing in on the gullibility of others, the author was a doctor who heavily self medicated herself before losing her right to practice not before endangering the lives of alot of her patients,dont give this fraudster your money"
5,Exellent book on spiritual warfare!,"The book exposes how satanism works in our society and how to identify it in a very accurate way. The first half of the book explains the life of ""Eleine"" as a satanist witch. Some stuff might be hard to believe at first sight, but then again we do hear on the news of babies found dead in garbage bags and people found mutilated every now and then. The second half of the book explains how the bible gives a solution to the satanism problem. The writting style is not as formal as accademic literature, but it's perfectly readable, very relaxed style. One more thing, before you read this book you must pray that the Holy Spirit guides you through it. Since the power and majesty of God (Jesus Christ) is unmatched by anyone, nothing of what people say in the other reviews of ""haunting ghosts"" and road stories if you read this book will do you any harm at all. Read this book, it will be a real eye opener!"
5,Calling ALL Warriors of the New Millennium!,"I read this book plus two others. I did not know there was another one out. I want it! I most definitely recommend all of them! To those that oppose it, you are bringing destruction on your own head. No if, ands, or buts about it. End of discussion."
1,Dose anyone actually believe this book?,Ok I know a whole church who took this seriously! How could you its obviuosly a hoax! Do you actually believe somone can physically change into a WereWolf? This book is full of nonsence like that. Im so scared the usa is secretly being run by satanic Witches!! lol This book is just a newer version of the Maleus Maleficarum in my opinion. Only the trully paranoid would ever take this conspiracy theory seriously. If you do take this book seriously id sugest a book calld Profesional Mental Help
3,One thing bothered me.,"I believe the book to be full of many true facts. We have known for several years, that Satan has at least 4 brides in the United States alone. However, one thing bothered me toward the end of the book. The precious black couple mentioned. . . their 4 year old was taken and skinned alive in their presence. Why, when they were allowed to go home, didn't they alert the police to this horrendous act? It is hard for me to belive that they did nothing about this. The book doesn't say anything more about it."
1,Concerned,"This book is dangerous and unbiblical. Associated with this book are lies, fear and an overall sense that God is weaker than Satan.I have been ministering deliverance to thousands - worldwide for over 33 years. He Came to Set the Captives Free is oftentimes one of the books that had been read by the person wanting freedom -- fear, incubus spirits, anxiety and many other problems started as a result of this book. Rebecca Brown books shouldn't be used as a validation for any true and Biblical method of deliverance."
1,As one of those who has fallen prey to Satan...,"It's so sad to see that this book's supporters can't think up anything better than the old satanic control excuse to explain why we don't like this book. Let's get a few things straight: ""Dr."" Rebecca Brown lost her license to practice medicine after diagnosing several conditions as demonic possession among other things. The language and holidays among other things are not those used by Satanists. There are no more than a few thousand Satanists in North America, no where near the amount needed for these big evil cults Brown speaks of. Thorns bend so there's no way they could penetrate someone's skull like the crown in this book does. These are the reasons, among many others that this book is accepted as a sick and dangerous fantasy, not because Satan has control of us. Or is this just evidence that the conspiracy is so big that they got rid of all the evidence and planted this..."
2,"A good start, but it needs work.","Dr. Brown makes several good points about Satanism, but she falls short in some very important aspects. Her rejection of vegetarianism flies in the face of modern research and the original diet God gave to mankind (humans didn't eat meat until after the Flood, when all plant life was destroyed). I have also read spiritual warfare books where the prayer warriors were NEVER physically attacked. It causes me to wonder how strong Dr. Brown's relationship with the Lord is if these demons could wear her out like they did. Jesus nor his disciples ever got choked, tossed around etc. The only attempted exorcists that got beaten up were those who didn't have a relationship with Jesus (Acts; sorry I don't have the exact reference). As the Holy Spirit gives her more light, Dr. Brown will be able to write more credible commentaries."
1,Absolute Fiction!!!,The only purpose for this book is to feed the hateful stereotypes propagated by evangelical christains. This is just another example of how a small group of christains believe that lying about other beliefs and faiths is acceptable. Hate is hate.
1,Can you be any more egotistical and arrogant?,I actually went out and found this book in a library just so I could see if it was as bad as I thought it would be... and you know what... it was worse. Obviously the author has done ZERO research on witches or witchcraft... and most likely has never even looked into any religion other than her own. No one deserves to have their religious beliefs slandered in the way this author does.
1,Pure Fiction,"This book has done more damage that any book ever printed in the area of misinforming the Body of Christ about the Occult and individuals that are in the Occult. Research on the author has proven that she wrote this in an attempt to establish truth, so that she could teach theology and doctrine. Well, it is fiction. However, many in the Body of Christ have not practiced Acts 17:11 and swallowed her fiction as reality. And, the Body of Christ, those that need help coming out of the occult, and the way we see those that are still in the Occult all suffer because of her misinformation."
1,Dangerous and misleading,"Don't bother buying it unless you're looking for a good fiction novel. The woman changed her name because she lost her medical license by giving people overdoses of narcotics(herself included)to treat unreal illnesses supposedly caused by demon possession, and after failing a psychological evaluation because of delusional behavior. She nearly KILLED the ""Elaine"" you read about in her books several times with overdoses of phenobarbital. Definitely a sick, twisted, little woman."
1,"Don't bother with reading this, fantasy read","This book is out of the air, the author is mentally ill. It's all made up nut job crazy. The woman has had some serious mental issues."
1,This Book is a Fake,"I read this book years ago... I had questions about it then. I know now this book is NOT real. If you don't belive me read up about the author, you will see. Ask G-d about this.. she takes you down paths that never happened- to sell a book.Be very careful when looking for spiritual warfare books... some if not many are fake. If you want to know more about spiritual warfare... ask the L-rd & get in His Word, He WILL show you what to do about your problems."
3,Good but missing an important element,"Rebecca is very knowledgeable scripturally and has much wisdom, but one important one she overlooks is Eph. 5:12 'For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.' The heavy details in this book can really damage an innocent mind. I wish she had found a way to relate her experiences and wisdom without the graphic detail that brings a heaviness to one's spirit that is hard to shake."
1,Someone needs to find the truth,"OF all the Christian books I've ever read, this is not the best. Unfortunately, ""Dr."" Brown's reputation is not the best. I was extremely scared and offended by reading this book. Some of the things the author describes are so false that this book is hard to believe. She trys to drag her readers down by twisting the text of The Bible into lies. I am not saying that I have been ""taken by satan"", but the things that Brown writes are untrue and unbelievably horrible. The character of ""Elaine"" is a figment of Rebecca Brown's imagination. If you ask me, Brown knows nothing about the real satanist cult called The Brotherhood because there are under 1000 satanists in North America, (compared with the millions that she writes there are) and their practices don't include the violence she says they do. This woman needs to be told the truth and I pray that God will free her mind from the lies that she tells."
1,Fanning the flames,"This book really deserves a minus 5 stars. Ms. Brown did not do her homework. Anyone who knows even the most basic tenents of Wicca or Witchcraft is fully aware that Satan only exists in the Christian pantheon. It is not possible for a wiccan practitioner to worship a diety that only exists in the Christian realm (since Pagans don't worship Christian religious figures). SHAME ON MS. BROWN. I, for one, have had enough of this blatant Hate-Mongering. Perhaps Ms. Brown should do a little research into the REAL history of the Witch burnings, and the role that the ""good"" christians played? (and just how many innocent Christians were burned along with midwives and spinsters-- for the economic gain of a greedy few)"
5,This Amazing Book that changed my life quickly!,"Dr. Rebecca Brown, EXCELLENT JOB for your book writing!!! I read this book and immediately apply it to my life forever. My name is Timothy Stark and I live in Arlington, VA. I attend my fundamenatal church every sunday. I strongly recommend that to everyone including satanists.I read other three books: Prepare For War, Becoming A Vessel Of Honor, and Unbroken Curses from the same author. Yes, I have similar experience like Dr. Brown and her Elaine. I am fighting aganist Satan and his demons through name of Lord Jesus Christ. This book is for REAL, not a fraud. Do not be deceived!SATAN and His Demons, In Name Of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave us immediately!! Amen!God Bless you."
1,A fraud.,It wouldn't be such a big deal if this was just a book of fiction. The problem is that some people really get sucked into the paranoid thinking of the book. I have seen some people almost lose it mentally after reading this and buying into it. This book is harmful. Don't read it. Discourage anyone you know who is thinking about reading it from reading it.
1,Gabbing with a Guardian Angel?,"Through pages 123-127 of the subject book, the author Rebecca Brown, MD., chats with her ""guardian angel"" for ""close to two hours."" It reads more like coffee talk with a peer.In Luke 1:26-38, the angel Gabriel only spoke few succinct sentences to Mary, foretelling Jesus' Birth (he wasn't gabby about it).Satan is still disguising himself as an ""angel of light"" to deceive people (2 Cor. 11:14)."
1,Get a clue,"Obviously, this woman knows only hearsay about the occult and witchcraft. The religion of Witchcraft is a very peaceful one, and the occult is a path to seek knowledge, enlightenment, and one's own personal veiw of God. If you want to know about witchcraft, get something by Raymond Buckland, Scott Cunningham or even SIlver RavenWolf, if you need it softened up. (Silver does have a tendency to do that)As of the general occult, I suggest Dion Fortune. Do some REAL homework before you make judgements on a wonderful practice...we are not enemies of Jesus. (I happen to like him very much) I am a witch, I am proud of it, and I wish a Blessed Be to everyone!"
5,Truth will set you free,"One thing I have grown to learn is some people really don't understand how the enemy has come to numb the understanding of his kingdom. This book was very insightful. You can think you don't have principalities assigned to you if you want, but that is complete contradiction to the Word. You can not have effective ministry without knowing how satan and his emmisaries function. demons are real and thier assignment is very clear...they came to steal, kill and destroy the same assignment as thier father. Whoever reads this book, before you read this book ask God pray and ask God for His Spirit to lead and guide you into all truths. This books purpose is to enlighten you and one of the most important TRUTHS you will recieve is Our God will never leave nor forsake you and we have angels that protect us even when satan launches his greatest attacks. So, just be lead by the Spirit before, during and after reading this book.In His service!"
5,the best book on spiritual warefare I ever read,"This book will not let Christians remain in denial about the occult and its attemped infiltration of the Christian Church in America. It is must reading for old and new Christians alike. Although parts of the book are upsetting to the unsuspecting or uneducated Christian, every comment has a scriptural basis, and is accurate. While I understandably question some of the content, it is only due to my lack of experience and knowledge. The things that I have personal spiritual experience with is not contradicting to her story in any way. Many references to Tozier and Watchman Nee, whose readings are spiritually sound and deep are quoted. Read this book! It will change your life."
1,This woman needs help.,I had the misfortune of reading this book when I was a very young new Christian. Young as I was I couldn't tell fiction from fantasy. I came across a copy in my old things and couldn't believe that garbage like this is still in print. No wonder fundamentalists are so paraniod!P.S. I am not under satanic control as I write this!
4,Food for thought,I thought this a very interesting book. It's normally not the kind of book I am interested in. But it makes me wonder more about what is really out there.
4,Not a boring book!,"This is a christian book that deals with witchcraft/satanism;written in story form-first half and gives out information (author's views)-second half. First, this is not the BIBLE;so therefore one has to take the story by faith. However, the author's views on occult practices are correct- One is playing with fire, regardless if you practice white or black magic;or do innocent occult practices ,like palm reading.All occult practices get their power source from dark forces. Satan is an angel of light,out to decieve many. He can give powers to people; (powers,which do good things) as long as he knows he has your soul. Even if you doubt the authors credibility, she is correct that ALL occult practices are sinful and are DANGEROUS.This fact is biblical ;which is why I give it four stars. Please read ""A Divine Revelation of HELL"" by Mary K Baxter. She deals with these issues also...the people and consequences...."
3,Look at it this way: she's a satanist.,She's merely making money off of the same thing other priests have been doing all along: misdirecting the masses. Seriously: you can have as many black candles as you want but you can only have one white candle (during a satanic ritual). It looks to me like the individual in the black robe is holding up a white candle. (Shhh! We're supposed to assume it's jesus holding the sword. You're messing up her mojo!)
1,he came to set the captives free,"okay i was given this book my cousin, who wanted to warn me about witchcraft(yes i'm a witch). first of all this book is not about the craft it's about a santanist 2 entirely different things. second, this book was sometimes manipulative, far fetched, and just a really sad attempt on trying to scare people that are individuals into following the herd. i am actually a catholic witch(i practice magick in the name of god-yes your god) and was appauled when i read that the pope actually works w/the devil. this book also states the the rosary, and crystals are talisman of the devil. i don't know if this is a true story or not, but i do know it's not a story on the craft. books like this manipulate the reader through fear. the funny thing is that on the first page of this book there is a quote that saids""satan works through fear"". kinda makes you think. bright blessings gypsy dragonspell"
5,Enemy - Satan exposed,"It is true that our true enemy is Satan. Its not for us to advertise for him. But it is helpful to know our enemies stratigies. We overcome Satan by the blood of Jesus, by the Word of God and by Our testimony. The direction of the Holy Spirit is vital to this. The book does't mention about the work of the Holy Spirit. The gift of God as mentioned in Corinthians is Love and helping people in whatsoever manner to release from bondage is secondary to this unless filled by the love from God. Please also read the book ""They shall Expel Demons"" and its better to be aware of unclean spirits influence than to dabble with them unless God gives his guidence for this ministry."
4,He Came To Set The Captives Free,"This is a fantistic book for those of us who must engage in spiritual warefare with invisible entities! This book taught me more of what I was, and still, must do battle against. Dark forces, elementals, spirits,inter-dimensonal shadow people, demons and nephilim spirits. This book chilled me to the bone! Very informative!This book is a must read for occultist and christians alike!"
1,An Invitation to Fear and Narrow-mindedness,"I read this book at the behest of a Christian friend seeking to convince me of the reality of demons and the sort of ""spiritual warfare"" that Dr. Brown and Christians like her tend to envision. The only thing I came away convinced of was the unfortunate consequences of narrow and fear-inspired thinking. This book goes well beyond the condemnation of alleged satanic cults. It casts even the practices of Eastern religions as tools of deception wielded by the Devil's agents. In an increasingly small and interconnected world, such thinking is likely to produce more fear and paranoia than it is freedom. Let's not return to the Dark Ages."
5,Set Free,"I found this book very interesting and I thought it was very good. I think alot of ""Cristians"" don't relize what really goes on in this world and they are spiritually blind. This book helped me relize alot of things that I was spiritually blind in and through the power of God and the blood of Jesus i have over come and through this book I could see that. I highly recommend this book to people. Glory be to God. Amen!"
1,A great work of ignorance,"I found it difficult to finish this book, particularly after reading page 183 which stated that ALL martial arts are gateways to demons along with ALL rock music. Also the passage where Rebecca interrogates an angel. ALL references in the Bible where an angel was seen by someone resulted immediately in the person prostrating themselves on the ground. Angels always have to say to them to ""fear not""....so I am completely convinced that not only is Rebecca Brown a paranoid lunatic, she is a brazen liar. Don't read this unless you ascribe to flights of wild fancy and drug-induced dreams."
1,Horribly Flawed,"A friend loaned me this book, and having studied spiritual warfare in the past, I was definietly interested. There is little doubt that the author is a doctor of medicine, and not theology. The interpretation of scripture is quite inconsistent and even lauhable at times. The author shows that even though her basic premise is correct (there is a war going on versus evil spirits), her doctrine and credibility is horribly flawed. A much better choice would be one of several books by Neil Anderson. He uses the scriptures much better, and more properly. I am praying for those enamoured by this book....those who are facing Satan's true most dangerous weapon: not fear, but rather DECEPTION! The Bible tells us to ""test the spirits"" to avoid false teachings. Anyone who honestly does this will disregard this book. (Sorry I usually do not rant like this, but I truly felt it important to say! Don't ignore the reality of spiritual warfare...but please find a better source book!)"
5,scary good,"some players define their instrument. A small handful transcend it. Jerry Douglas is part of that handful. Interestingly enough on this record some of the handful who are transcendent are playing with Douglas. Derek Trucks, Bela Fleck, John Fogerty appear, bringing their unique voices on their respective instruments to an iconoclastic effort from Douglas.Admittedly I'm a Derek Trucks obsessive, but he is off the charts on She Makes Me Want to Sing. Fogerty makes Swing Blues #1 a special outing (is this an old Bob Wills tune, I can't remember). Who's Your Uncle brings us back to bluegrass. Perhaps the most out of the box effort is the cover of Joe Zawinul's A Remark You Made. Weather Report is not exactly the usual suspect for a dobro players cd, but as stated before Jerry Douglas is no average dobro player.Just an amazing record, highly recommend"
5,"Jerry will always be the best, and most creative Dobro player!","I have the utmost respect for musician's who push the boundries of their instruments. Mr. Douglas continues to explore all avenues: folk, traditional, country, blues, jazz, & bluegrass. I really can't say enough great things about this CD. The drummer in my band says this CD ""rocks his world""."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"This is an early 80's slasher horror all the way. It is not as bad as some, but not as good as others. 5 young people in the woods getting attacked by a crazy mountain man is the simplest way to sum up the movie. The acting is okay with George Kennedy headlining the cast. The story is fairly simple and straightforward without many surprises. If you love your early 80's films such as Sleepaway Camp, then this will be a hidden gem for you. The dvd comes without extras, and the print quality is passable. They should have taken the time to clean up the copy."
4,great horror flick that needs a better print.,"I bought this one because of the good reviews (on the low budget horror movie scale) it got here on amazon.com and they were right. This is a decent horror movie with good actors and a logical plot. It has some gore; but one character dies offscreen for some reason. The print could have been cleaned up more certainly. But it's still very watchable even with the occasional lines in it. Film legend George Kennedy also does a great job as a forest ranger who isn't around just to get slaughtered by the killer. This was highly inspired by Deliverance or 'the hill have eyes"" in some regards; as in backwoods hill people on the loose.This may not sastisfy the bloodthirtiest of viewers but it is a decent low budget movie that is just what you expect it to be."
3,Great chiller horror movie,"What I really like about this movie was the atmostphere. It was filmed up in the mountions of Salem Oregon. The music also made a chilling factor of this movie. There is very little gore and nudity, but the film is very well worth while. The story goes like this. Some kids go on a camping trip up in the mountains where to twin crazy killer brothers live. Well you can probably figure out what happens next. Not bad at all. A worthy 80's slasher movie."
2,"OK, but the DVD isn't.","The film is OK, but the picture quality is rather poor, plus its edited! The extra is awesome, however, but wish they could revisit it one of these days. Worth the price of a rental for now."
3,"Standard campers-in-peril slasher except that there's no blood, sex or partying.","Opening with a hunter getting a very large knife to the groin and out the [...] (later copied in EVIL LAUGH) I was pretty excited and hoping for a nonstop killathon, but unfortunately outside of the very last kill that was the most exciting thing to happen in the whole film.Five campers head out into the deep forest for some hiking and from the very beginning they're stalked - unknowingly - by two big ugly greasy psychos. They stalk them and stalk them and finally after close to an hour the killing starts...with no blood. I'm not even sure how this film got an R-rating. Slightly boring, but watchable."
1,boring!,"don't get tricked by the other reviews saying this movie was good it wasn't. It was a very boring slasher ""if you want to call it that"" not much kill scenes except for the beginning of the movie. Kind of reminded me of the texas chainsaw massacre movie and the friday the 13th movies but those movie's were much better than this boring mess. Stupid story and a very stupid ending. STAY AWAY PLEASE!"
2,Okay EQ for the price,"Although small and compact, this EQ was cheap, but now I know why. Slide buttons a little stiff to move, so when you do, you tend to move them too much one way or the other. The only lights on this are for the fader, EQ, and sub buttons; there are NO lights on the EQ slides. For some reason, the low frequency on the 5-band eq effects the sub. With a separate sub control, this shouldn't be this way."
3,Dora is O.K.,"I bought this for my 2yr old for Christmas since she loves Dora so much. She isn't interested in it at all. Other than that, the doll is O.K. It was easy to program. Dora is also suppose to speak up when it is time to go to bed and wake up. She supposedly gets her timing from your computer when you program her...even though our computer has the right time on it she alwasy talks in the middle of the night saying that ""its time to go to bed."" YEAH! I guess so!"
5,DO NOT BLAME THE DOLL!!!,For those people who are having problems w/ the download. I had the same problem downloading the information into Dora - don't blame the doll. It kept telling me that she was not connected to the computer no matter how many times I plugged it in. I use Windows XP and it automatically asked me if I wanted to update a program and then once I did that it downloaded perfectly. it happened so fast and the fact it was 6am I don't remember exactly what updated - I believe it had something to do with my USB.looks like the problem is with your computer - not the doll....
2,Do any of them work/,We are on our second doll. The first one wouldn't hold any information that we downloaded. Everything was easy to download and the doll would go through one cycle and then revert to the basic words she came with. We sent it back and got another one and now cannot download anything for this one. We're just getting error messages. This toy seems like a great idea and I'm envious of those who have one that works. My 2 year old has been constantly disappointed with this toy. Especially Christmas morning when the first one didn't work.
2,Not Satisfied,I was excited to buy this toy for my 16 month old daughter intill I was programming dora. While programing the doll it would not take in her name or any other name that was not on the list.
5,Wonderful toy!,"I bought this toy several Christmas' ago for my 2 year old little girl. She loves it and still plays with it. The doll is also very durable and well made. I love that the shoes are painted on and therefore can not be removed. The software is amazing and very easy to use. Note: if you lose the computer attachment cord for downloading, you can use any USB with that type of attachment. I used my printer cord until I could find mine."
4,Cute toy!!!,I got this for out 2 year old niece and sent it to her for christmas. I was able to get it out and program it before sending it to her so it was all ready to go when she opened it.
4,Good for a 3 Year Old Girl,"We gave this doll to our daughter for her 3rd birthday present and she hasn't let go of it for the last 4 days. She adores it and talks back to it. I plan on changing the stories and songs frequently to keep it entertaining to her. If your little girl loves watching Dora, then she will love this doll. Amazon has it at a great price compared to retail stores and it arrived in under 3 days."
2,A little disappointed,"It is cool how you can program the names. Just disappointed in only having the three options at a time. The adventure is going through the gate and dora ask for the key out of the backpack(that she doesn't have). She says ""say backpack"". My daughter turned two in September and her response was ""Dora doesn't have a backpack"". It also seems that she says things in almost the same order everytime. I would have spent the money on the Dora dollhouse or something else Dora if I had to do again. Especially if you have a big Dora fan in your house. My daughter has had more fun with all the figures from the Dora house than this doll."
4,Dora Knows Your Name Software is NOT Mac Compatible,"Being a Mac user, I wanted to know if the software used for this toy is Mac compatible. I couldn't find the information online, but when I spoke to Fisher Price customer service, they confirmed the the software is, indeed, NOT Mac compatible. You need Window 2000 or higher. (You can ignore my star rating - I don't have an opinion yet, since I didn't buy it because it's not Mac compatible.)"
5,SHE KNOWS EVERY NAME!,"My daughter loved this doll. We gave it to her for her 2nd birthday and she was so ecstatic when Dora said her name. I agree with a previous review that you do have to update the information quite frequently or Dora will keep repeating the same things over and over. The information did take up a lot of space on my computer, but you will be blown away at the options that come with this doll. She knows your childs name, friends name, favorite: food, color, animal, song. She is also on a timer. She'll say things like ""time to get up,"" ""time for a nap,"" ""time to go to bed,"" etc. It really is cute! Excellent quality too. Comes with everything you need, definetly worth the Money!To me the only downfall was having to update information so often. Which you don't have to, but children change their minds so often, that you will probably have to!"
5,"THANK YOU, DAVID GUY!","How refreshing and exciting to be able to peek inside a man's mind, heart, and soul for an honest and uncensored look at how he REALLY feels about love, sex, relationships, and desire. I'll read this one again, something I've never done with any other book. I can't help myself -- I've fallen in love with this guy! I'll be looking forward to more from this author"
3,Mediocre book on dealing with worry and anxiety,"I would give this book a C+. Most of the passages I hilighted were not the author's thoughts, but ideas she had pulled from the Bible or other books. She does have a few original ideas, but given the book's $10 price tag I wasn't overly impressed.As strictly a counseling or self-help book, I think it falls short,perhaps an expanded Bible study version would be more appreciated."
4,Mr.,This is the best adhesive I've ever used but I think the product is too expensive to keep buying if it were a lot cheaper I would buy it all the time.
4,Uro-Bond III 5000 Silicone Skin Adhesive Purchase,"While I can use this product for my pump supplies, I used it to pin my ears back for an updo I wanted to wear. It worked fine and was easy to remove, but the adhesive worked for no more than 24-36 hrs."
3,Doesn't work on Taping Dog's ears,Tried to use this for Taping Dog's ears. Doesn't work. Super messy. It was really hard to get it out of his fur. But then I used a lot of oil and got it out!
2,What were they thinking!!!,Great music. Less than great videos. These twoelements were not put together very well at all.There's no syncronicity between the the music andfilm. It's like they slapped scenes of oceans andmountains together without any regard to what wasgoing on in the music. I'm shocked the musicians allowedthis. It's not a complement to their music at all. Thevideos are just as bad. The only thing that saves thisdvd is the live performances. Better off buying the cd.
2,Doesn't help much,"Being the ultimate cheapskate I went to the library to look at this book to see if I would want to buy it. I am so glad I didn't buy it first. Everything in this book you can look up in the net for free. There are no suggestions that I haven't seen before.If you are brand new to the frugal experience, save your money and do web surfing instead. You are already paying for that."
3,Lots of information,"This book provided a lot of information that is helpful to the reader. Mary Hunt is very good at communicating. I found this book to be kind of a retread on her other books. I wish it were a little more fresh and different from the others. It's still a good read, though."
4,Great strategy for debt elimination!,"I read the book and I'm now on my second month of a 39 month ""Rapid Debt Repayment Plan"". This is how long it will take to pay off $25,000 of unsecured debt, by simply making CURRENT minimum monthly payments. The strategy is also shown online at ""Cheapskate Monthly"". Check it out, use it and start a new life!"
4,Divine Madness: Mohammed Abdulle Hassan (1856-1920),"This has been one the best book I have read for a long time. This book is well researched and well written. What I like about the writing of the book was that it was clear and very impartial, a true academical work. I believe his book should be a authority to the study of the Sayyid. The writer should be congratulated for the extensive reseach that he undertook before writing this book. It shows from the writing of the book, congratulation sir."
2,Doesn't account for all the battles,"The history of the dervishes will not be complete unless the battles against the Warsangeli Sultanate are studied and included. Most Somali historians ignore this fact, but the resistance from the Warsangeli army brought about the downfall of the Dervishes."
4,Quick Read,"Richard Maybury does a great job as Uncle Eric teaching his nephew Chris and all of us about fiancial matters.This is written for high school age readers, but I am finding his whole collection of books enjoyable. I getto read them first before my children get them. You probably won't find these on the school reading list, buta must read for any high school age child."
2,Don't Be Fooled,"This particular book is overpriced for the 45 pages that you receive. What I did not know before is that this version (ISBN: 0942617207) is a transcript of the audio cassette. This is an important distinction since it is not clearly marked as such int he title.I have not read the book, therefore I am unqualified to give a detailed account. However, from what the transcript offers, it seems plausible to assume the book would be an excellent read.It receives 2 stars because it is overpriced and because it is the transcript and not the actual book (which I had been led to believe)."
2,A very sad story BLS,This book is a book that teaches you to value your friendship before you lose them. But when they lost dennis to a drowning incident they were feeling sorry because they never really liked him and they did not really pay attention to him. And what about Arlie Leeper he's something. Jamie and the families are afraid of him because he lost dennis his son so now they bring out there rifles to scare him off. If you like sad but supenseful books you should read this book
4,The Hero Review,"Have you ever lied to get yourself off the hook or cover-up something? In this novel, Jamie tries to make everyone in his town believe that Dennis is hero but nobody would fall for this lie. Isolated by all his neighbors, Arlie Leeper wants someone to pay for his son's death and is ravaging for the murderer of his lost boy. Consequently, Jamie's dad assures Arlie that this tragedy was not directly caused by anyone but if he insists on blaming somebody, it would have to be him. Arlie took this message a little too seriously and is out to hunt him down. He says that a Leeper gets even and that's what Jamie is afraid of. This novel completely redefines the adventure genre books and Ron Woods is able to handle the ending with emotion depth and a convincing ending. I would highly recommend this page-turner to anyone who wants to read a book that explores human nature. The only thing that this novel needed was length because I thought Woods could extend his plot."
4,The Unexpected Hero,The Hero is a great book. I dont read much but the book caught my attention. This book is mind blowing by the unexpected things that happen in this book. Its about a boy who is on summer break and he is help out around the house and also building a raft. Jamie and his friends are going to try to finsih the raft. They get it finished and ready to try it out but something goes wrong.
5,Excellent artist - not well known,"I saw Vance Gilbert in concert about 3 years ago in a little coffee house in upstate New York. I was truly amazed by his singing voice. He has a wonderful sense of humor and combined with his music, it makes for a great evening of fun. Some of his songs are so haunting...esp. Unfamilar Moon.If you ever get a chance to see him in person, do so. But his music is well worth buying."
4,EQUILIBRIUM,yo...this cd is tight...kamachi and ag put it down on this one. the beats and lyrics are smooth like wasaaabi! go get your own.
3,"Good, buy expected more.","I thought the book was very interesting. I good start. I was expecting it to be a little more in depth on the face reading. Instead, there was more about macrobiotics than I expected. It was somewhat of an advertisement for this topic. Otherwise, I found it to be very helpful."
4,Recommended Introduction,"This rudimentary book explicates and interprets lines and configurations of the face, hands, and body areas, as well as voice and handwriting, according to macrobiotic principles of dietary consumption which have their roots in Oriental medicine."
3,Confusing,"I found this book created more confusion than understanding for me. This book has some interesting ideas, but neglects to really help you understand them. It seems to me to be way to generalized, each human body is so individual and what effects one may be completely different in another This book seems to make so many rigid rules and finite ideas on the way things are. In my experience that's just not life everything and everyone is so different. I am not so sure eastern medicine is not as rigid as western in it's own unique way. This book did put forth some very good and helpful ideas, but was mostly confusing."
5,30' Vacuum Hose,"The item arrived on time and in perfect condition. I also purchased a hose set from my big box home repair store. Between the two products, I had lots of adapters and was able to extend the reach of the product to about 40'. My next step is to construct a connector so I can vacuum inside the house while leaving the shop vac outside the house. With the shop vac outside the house, I won't have to worry about polluting the air in the house."
1,Failed Quickly,Maybe I'm just unlucky with batteries but I got 2 of these and they crashed after a few uses. Could not reach the company. Sorry. I went back to genuine Oly batts.
2,I never got them.,I wait for this 4 weeks and the seller Red_Hot_Buys never sent this item but the good thing here is Amazon refunded my money 2 weeks after I complained.
1,Waste,"This book is a total waste of money. For anyone who has any back trouble, this is just a repeat of exercises you can find on the internet, or that your doctor, chiropractor or physical therapist has already given to you. Don't waste your money on this book!!"
2,Door scratch protector,"Unfortunately the velcro strips are stronger than the glue that holds them onto the door. So our dog, a 15 pound bichon tore the protector with its velcro right off the door. The idea is good but didn't stand up to an actual dog and a little on at that."
3,"Prevents door scratches, but falls out of place often","This product works well to prevent scratches on the door when it is in place. However, the small velcro dots do not seem to hold on to the door well. The velcro sides are fine, but the adhesive side for the door comes losse very often, especially when the weather turned cold. I would supplement this product with better adhesive velcro dots, or for that matter, cut out your own piece of thick clear vinyl and create your own."
1,door pet scratch protector,"Poor description and customer service. Was suppose to fit any door. Would not lie flat as shown. Bowed out and down from handle. Bought 3. Since there wasn't anything ""technically"" wrong with them, they would accept them back but would not help with any shipping and suggested that since they wouldn't, ""you might want to just keep them"". Lesson well learned when dealing with this company."
2,Eh,"The actual protector itself is a good product, but the stickies that come with it are not strong enough to hold up the weight of the protector."
3,"Works great, but...","Kept the door from getting scratched up, but it needs magnets embedded in it instead of the stick on velcro. If put on a door that is in direct sunlight most of the day, especially in TX, the glue on the velcro will melt and the protector will fall off."
3,Requires knob,"Requires actual door knob. If you have any special type of lock, such as a door handle rather than knob, it will not work. I kept it in case I need to use it elsewhere, but right now it is not being used."
3,Needs to secure better,"I have a small dog that weighs about 20 lbs and at first he didn't seem to scratch at it much but after a few times of him being home alone, it began to come off the door and won't stay on very easily anymore. The idea is good but i'd like something more securely attached to the door."
4,Does the job,"The 1st day after we attached the Door Scratch Protector to the outside of the back door, our dog was stand offish, and wouldn't come near the door. After about a week, she will sit up next to it, but won't scratch. After 2 weeks, she has scratched on the door twice, but she really doesn't like how it gives a bit. We're on week 4 and the adhesive is not holding the velcro to the door, so we'll have to get some gorilla glue to make sure it stays in place. For the price, we are pleased with this product. If the adhesive would have held, I would rate this a 5."
2,Packaging should be improved,"The idea and product are good, but I think that the packaging should be improved.Since it was folded in 3 in a box, it's impossible to make it straight after I opened the package. It has some minor damages due to folding, also. Since it's bent and thick plastic, the velcro tape is helpless. I think that it's just better than nothing to protect a door."
4,Better then expected,Was a little uncertain to order something like this but our dogs did do some damage to other doors. It arrived- looked rather thin- but was easy to mount- it works just fine. No problems at all. Going to order some additional protectors. They are a litlte thin and will likely have to be replaced in a couple of years but well worth the replacement cost.
3,decieving,the plastic is fine but the picture is decieving. I put it on a dark wood door and adhesive is big white velcro dots. On a white door it is fine but looks not so good on a brown wood door!
1,Disappointment,I researched conical burr grinders and though the Maestro Plus would be the best value and quality. I was disappointed as the grinder did not grind oily beans at all without jamming. I have returned the grinder fro credit and have purchased another brand which is easier to clean and has not jammed to date.
2,Not a good choice for espresso,"This nice machine has 32 settings, but the lowest setting of 1 isn't fine enough for an espresso grind. I can't even use it for my regular coffee, which I make using a cone-type filter. My coffee shop grinds my regular coffee on their espresso setting and it's just right for my filter coffee and my espresso machine, but this grinder produces too coarse a grind for this purpose."
5,Good Product Backed by Great Service,"I have used this grinder daily for about two years and I always get consistent results. I tend to grind medium or dark roast coffees to a medium or coarse grind. The machine does occasionally jam, but it usually clears quickly.I had one unfortunate incident where an under-roasted bean caused the machine to jam and I stripped the main gear. It was after my warranty period, but Baratza's web site has a troubleshooting section that explained the problem and said they could provide a replacement part. I contacted them by email and they shipped the part free of charge the same day. I disassembled the grinder and installed the new gear in about 30 minutes. The process was clear and well-documented with descriptions and photos in a document on their web site.I'm very happy with their service and I'll buy another Baratza when it's time to upgrade."
2,POOR INSTRUCTIONS AND POOR CONSTRUCTION,"I OWN A STARBUCK BARISTA GRINDER FOR OVER 5 YEARS, BUT WANTED A MACHINE THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO GET GRIND STRAIGHT INTO THE FILTER BASKET.THE MAESTRO PLUS LOOKED LIKE IT FILLED THE BILL. HOWEVER IT JAMMED THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. SPEAKING TO THE SERVICE DEPT. TURNS OUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE USE THE FINE SETTING UNTIL THE MACHINE HAVE BEEN 'BROKEN IN', WHICH WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE INSTRUCTION BOOK. CLEANING OUT THE MACHINE WAS VERY DIFFICULT, AND ALSO REVEALED A MECHANISM VERY SIMILAR MY TRUSTY STARBUCK MACHINE, BUT THE PASTIC PARTS WERE MUCH FLIMSIER. AFTER SEVERAL CALLS TO SERVICE IT STILL DID NOT GRIND PROPERLY. I ENDED UP RETURNING IT."
3,Plastic junk,"This is a rather expensive cone grinder that produces an excellent grind. This one is the 2nd generation model. The first one walked across the counter when run and the coffee had a static charge that blew coffee everywhere. This new model is much improved with the adding of a heavy base. The trouble with this model is it must be cleaned which means taking it apart. Even with extreme care (I've owned two) it is hard to avoid breaking the fragile plastic parts. I suspect the next generation will fix the fragile burr assembly. While I wait, I have purchased a KitchenAid grinder that is more robust AND easy to clean."
1,Please Don't Waste Your Money,"To give this grinder the benefit of doubt, I'll have to assume it was dropped and damaged in the factory before shipping, though there's no physical evidence of this. I don't know how else to explain it's terrible performance.For starers, it made a horrible, oscillating, whining noise while grinding (imagine something like the noise a trash compactor might make). The grind quality was terrible. No matter the grind setting, it spit out dust and coffee chunks. I took it apart and reassembled it. The burrs appeared undamaged, and I made sure they were seated properly. No change. I tried oily beans and I tried dry, lightly roasted beans. Horrible noise, dust and chunks.I put it back in the box and sent it back the same day. After more research I purchased a Capresso Infinity (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AR7SY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title) for much less, and I couldn't be happier! Please don't waste your money on the Baratza."
2,Messy,"Regardless of the grind setting some of the coffee is going to come out somewhat powdery. When you pull the bin out of this unit, static cling will pull some of the coffee up to adhere to the front of it. Also, some will cling to the top of the interior of the grinder and then fall down. Some will stay inside the grinder and will also fall down. Of course, eventually all of this coffee winds up on your counter (or floor). The upshot is that there is a mess to clean up EVERY time you use it."
4,Excellent Grinder,"Extremely fast shipping (about 10 days faster than the other items (sold directly by Amazon) on the same order).The burr grinder operates well, and doesn't require too much cleaning or maintenance. The only downside seems to be that even the most coarse setting is still ground too fine for good french press brewing."
3,"grinds fine,lousy switch","After lengthy review research I chose this grinder.On the second day of using the switch broke.They were nice enough to send a new switch which I haven't had time to replace yet.I must turn on and off by plugging and unplugging into the outlet.I do like the way it grinds ,but very disappointed in the switch and their request that I repair a two day old grinder."
2,solis burr grinder,"the solis makes a good grind, is nice and heavy, and does not create much static. but... and this is a big but, the tabs that set the particle size of the grind are plastic and break off. (maybe the key is to set the grind and leave it). once that happens, your $100+ grinder is worthless. it would be great if the ring was made of metal. and maybe they'll get there if they haven't already."
4,Good results with creative cleaning,"I've had this grinder for 6 months and am, overall, happy with it. I would also recommend it for someone who has the patience to clean it regulary. I use the suggested paper clip on the ground coffee shoot and on the plastic fins that feed it under the cone. I also use a cotton swab on the cone itself.Now that I've done it a few times, this all takes about 5-8 minutes. If you want a machine that works flawlessly without any grounds spilling or cleaning, then this isn't the grinder for you. But I can deal with it. This is my first conical grinder so I do not know if this appliance is better/worse than others in cleaning or coffee flavor."
1,Baratza Maestro 385,"I bought this grinder a couple of years ago after reading reviews. From day 1 I was never able to get a fine enough grind to pull a good shot of espresso... sometimes I got lucky with the right type of beans. I thought that it was the machine (a Starbuck's Barista) or just the beans. Eventually I just tolerated it. In the meantime I bought a couple of Costco grinders and returned them. My old $40 Braun was sorely missed at this point. Recently I began to buy Illy coffee pre ground and realized where the problem was... in the grinder. The Lavazza blue coffee also works well. So I have ordered another grinder (Lelit PL 041) I hope this stepless grinder will do the trick. I'll keep the Baratza for my ""hippy coffee"" (Chemex pour over) and French Press. I do not recommend this grinder."
2,Good machine-until it breaks...and it will.,"My wife and I make espresso every morning with a pavoni machine.We bought this grinder when we started getting very inconsistent grinds from starbucks (where we buy our coffee beans) The machine works well once you figure out the correct setting, which takes about 5 attempts. However, there is a glaring design flaw in that if you adjust the grind while the machine is off, two plastic tabs will break, rendering the machine useless. You actually have to turn the adjuster while you are grinding (wasting) beans.We just returned from thanksgiving to discover that our house-sitter changed the setting from espresso to drip, a reasonable thing to expect to do, and of course the little plastic tabs broke right off. It is insane. I have yet to hear back from the company (I got a machine) about a replacement part so we shall see. but the part that breaks should be made out of metal or a much stronger piece of plastic."
5,great grinder,"I almost did not buy this grinder because of some of the reviews, so here's mine. I had been using a Capresso Barista that I bought at Starbucks and this grinder is far superior to that one. Less mess, fuss and noise...grinds better more consistently and it is a breeze to clean.I so highly recommend this grinder, that to me, to buy anything else or this one is a no brainer. The coarse grinding for press/drip is perfect and I have used it for espresso and the fine grind was great too!!! I have an old fashioned espresso maker, not one of the electric type, and it ground great plus it has a pulse button on the front so you can get just one serving of grinds."
3,Hope it works,"I purchased this product through Amazon, based on thier reputation. I was shipped the Baratza Maestro Plus Coffee Grinder, which is made by Solis, instead of the Solis Crema Maestro. After about two weeks the timer would not work and you had to use the micro switch to grind the coffee. The place it came from said they are not allow to accept returns on this type of product, but they gave me a number to call to have it repaired, which I have been unable to reach anyone, nor have they retrun any calls. Amzon will not cover it under their A-Z warranty, so I have a $149 coffee grinder that partially works. I should have bought locally as I first thought. I does do a good job of grinding coffee."
4,Still as noisy as the cheapest one,"I read this burr grinder had great reviews and it does perform excellent. It has over 25 settings just for drip coffee. So it indeed does its job but it is N-O-I-S-Y!!!! I thought that when you pay more and the casing is heavier, the noise is reduced: NOT! I am not happy about that but indeed happy about the performance."
4,"Good, but not as good as the Monster Snow Goons!","This book is a collection of short comic stories about a 6-year old boy named Calvin and his ""invisible"" friend Hobbes. Hobbes is Calvin's stuffed-animal toy tiger that is real to Calvin and only Calvin can hear Hobbes talk. Rosalyn is Calvin's babysitter and he almost ""hates"" her.Calvin spends time with his babysitter because he is simply too much for his parents to handle and they need an occasional break like going out to dinner together. So they hire Rosalyn, a teenager, to sit Calvin. Rosalyn is paid well, so she agrees to babysit the little ""twerp"" but she regularly is asking for a pay rise.The conflicts between Calvin and his sitter Rosalyn are the source for the many great comic interactions. For example, when Calvin learns that Rosalyn wants to study for an important school exam, he tells Hobbes - ""Tonight Hobbes! The Revenge of the Babysats! Thus begin the hilarious antics that everyone from ages 8 and up will love to read about."
5,Brilliant stuff!,"This is the fifth installment of the ""Calvin and Hobbes"" series, and it just gets better every repeated reading. There are more adventures, and more significant discussions between the characters. Here we have the up and downs of winter, vengeance against Rosalyn the babysitter (hence the title), a propellor beanie, unstoppable hiccups, another boring week of camping, a little incident with Calvin's parents' car, and a chilling break-in of the family's house. We start to see more vivid imagination from Calvin, and much more philosophical strips that give the ""Calvin and Hobbes"" far more importance than it deserves. This is one hell of a comic, and it always be remembered as a classic."
4,Revenge of Watterson,"This is an excellent book; Bill Watterson did a fine job. Yet, what I noticed after reading it for the millionth time is that this book, and ""Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink'"" are put together to make ""The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes."" Of course, this is only a collection and ""The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes"" is a treasury, but I wish I had saved my money and bought Indispensable instead."
3,Nice features... too many flaws,"Flaws:1) Changing a fuse requires removing 4 screws on the back and disassembling a daughter board which has the battery wire threaded through it.2) DC Voltage ranges are 200mV, 2V, 200V, and 500V. If you are measuring something between 2V and 200V you will only have a readout precision down to 0.1V. That's pretty good precision at 200V. But at 3V it's only 1 part in 30.3) The front of the package claims that this model has an internal temperature sensor. While many of the 400 series multimeters have internal temperature sensors, this one does not. The back of the package gets it right showing that you'd need the model 220 to get the internal sensor. It does come with a thermocouple probe."
5,The Most Original Band Ever,"Mindless Self Indulgence is a ground-breakingly fresh new band. They combine so many elements of radically different musical genres. From the ripping power chords on ""Kill the Rock"" and ""Keeping up with the Kids"" to the reggae style vocals on ""Played,"" Mindless keeps their music innovative and new. If you like rock and want to experiment, This is the album. One of the year's best."
3,"Cool, intense electronic head trip . . .",". . . that is, if yer a major tweak-head. Otherwise, this CD hardly qualifies as music. If yer looking for melody, you can pretty much forget it here. Since I quit doing drugs, I can only take this stuff in small doses. But it is useful for clearing the ole cranium. And as far as the ""outrage factor"" goes, it might tee off an uptight & conservative mom or dad, but for me, music stopped being shocking long ago and this is far from the sickest stuff I've heard anyway."
3,Hm...,"MSI's music is unique, but a bit too offensive for me (which is saying something, because I'm not even 14). First off, is ""Jimmy Urine"" his real name? I really hope not. Pro's of the album: it's so completely different from everything else, the members know how to play instruments. Con's: They're just like Slipknot (meaning that they scream the whole time), all the songs are repetitive/sound the same, the music doesn't make you feel well...maybe only drug addicts are supposed to listen to it?"
1,Worst live band ever,"I listened to their music for some stupid reason after I saw them get booed off of the stage at a concert... The talent just isn't there. Almost all of the drums are drum machine but they still have a drummer? They may have the ambition, but they don't have my vote."
2,Get a new singer,This is would be my favorite band if they had vocals that werent...The lyrics in these songs are total...I say lose the singer and do all instrumental stuff and you would rock.
1,Pointless screaming and noise,"MSI has absolutely no talent at all. The pointless lyrics go along perfectly with the noise along with them. After seeing them get booed for 30 minutes straight at the Korn concert I can see that others agree with me. Also whats with that song ""I hate jimmy page""? I think they just like to make fun of people with talent because they know they're lacking it."
1,What in the name of?...,"It didn't give me the option to rate this cd with anything less than 1 star... If you buy this album, you are wasting your money, much less the time it takes to pull it off the shelf, carry it to the checkout counter, and give it to the clerk. I don't think i'd give this band the luxery of knowing the small expenditure of rubber off the bottom of my shoe - i wasted, while buying this cd. In other words. Don't buy it, it sucks."
1,One of the Absolute Worst CDs I've Ever Heard.,"I first heard MSI when this girl I work with mentioned them to me 4 years ago. I downloaded the cd (in retrospect, I'm glad I didn't waste any money on this piece of garbage labeled as ""music""), and like 5 songs into it I got bored and turned it off. I even agonized through the rest of it at one point, hoping it would get better. What a piece of trash! This is music? Their singer sounds like a tortured howler monkey trying to cross shock rock and pop culture references. There is no redeeming quality to this cd whatsoever.I don't even understand where people get off as calling this punk? What, because like all other punk music, it has people who can't play their instruments and compose horrible guitar arrangements?In short, this music is nothing but garbage aimed at impressing freshman in high school who want to be cool by buying their first cd with a ""Parental Advisory"" sticker slapped on it. and Hot Topic mall rats. Steer clear of this Sh*t."
5,Lil Jimmy Urine is Strangely Sexy,"This album is wack, so wack that it actually kills all my other cd's and send'em to hell and reigns supreme on my cd shelf. I love this cd, I love this world and I especially love you all. This album makes me smile, laugh, frown and dance- ALL AT THE SAME TIME ppl!!. This album has its ups and downs like mostly all other cd's, and it goes a little somthing like this;POINTS<>Lowest>Last time I tried to rock your worldLow>Holy Sh*tCore>I Hate Jimmy PageHigh>Golden IHighest.Keepin' up with all of the KidsAnd the song that never stops playing inside of my head even after I watched hours and hours of hardcore porn, spinning around in circles praying satan 'take these fowl lyrics outta my brain'>ClarissaF,J,M and Z aren't really songs but the coolest would have to be F, its funny and flows awesomely into Faggot."
2,"Great concept, but this model falls to pieces, get metal thermal model","Great concept, but this all plastic/rubber model falls to pieces, get metal thermal model which works great and endures with actual usage.Company delivered quickly and at good value when I ordered, though now preferred thermal model is not currently available..."
4,One That Will Please,"The repertoire is comprised of mostly familiar standards, but you won't get bored listening to this CD. Originally issued on an obscure LP on the Starfire label, Diamond Cut has filled the CD with more than a hour's worth of music, in very good sound, by adding five previously unissued titles from the same 1977 concert. Of special interest is Clarence Hutchinrider reprising ""Smoke Rings,"" the selection that brought him to the public's attention when he was featured on it during his tenure with the Casa Loma Orchestra. Of this recording, the IAJRC Journal CD reviewer wrote: ""Here is one that will please most of you, I'm sure."" I concur."
1,Never Delivered,Waited 3 months for First issue.Received one issue then they stopped coming.What's the deal?They need to get their act together seriously.
5,Ms. Jackson cover,Just picked up the Spring '07 Issue with the most lovely Ms. Jackson on the cover and I can't help but love the magazine for no other reason then the cover and Her inside photo and article.If you're a Janet Jackson fan you'll probably like this issue.I am and I do.
2,I hope this isn't where Baptists came from,"As a conservative Baptist and a historian I cannot reccommend this book, except for someone wanting to know about the claims of Landmark theology. The idea that heretical sects carried the Baptist distinctives until after the Reformation is absurb and has no historical evidence to back it up. I also think it is prideful to say that the Baptist church is the ""one true church"" as many Landmark adherents claim. The sects and groups that Carroll has aligned Baptists with are a mixed sort, but many denied fundamental Christian doctrine. Their beliefs are actually well documented, unlike this book. I cannot understand how this poor theology continues in Baptist circles."
5,This Little Book will change you life,"There are dissenters who speak out against pretty much everything - I prefer to let authors speak for themselves and to judge for myself what to believe and not to believe after careful study.This little book, along with books such as `Fox's Book of Martyrs', should be read and read prayerfully. Then each weighed on its merits by the individual reader. No one has the right to speak out for the author . . . that is presumptuous in the extreme.If a reader is studious they will research matters for themselves and not blindly accept the judgment of others, who are not the author and never knew the author, but who wish merely to muddy the waters and to discredit the work . . . This book is worth the reading."
3,McGoldrick does the best review,James E. McGoldrick does a better review on this book then I could. I do think an exilic church existed. Also James Parkes works on canon law suggests that any regard to celebrating Yeshua in accordance to the Jewish Calendar festivals was prohibited by medevial canon law.
2,Landmarkist Manifesto,"I won't lie, I am predisposition-ed against this book because I know Landmarkism is a fraud. Carrol is hardly an historian, granted he did a great deal of research, however it was to prove his point that the Baptist church was the true church from ages past back to the Apostles. While a Baptist myself, I find the majority of this book to be utter nonsense. For a much more accurate portrayal, I would recommended H. Leon McBeth's work:The Baptist Heritage"
3,"Ok, but could be better","I registered for this diaper bag because it had the smaller matching one. My daughter is now 7 months old and the strap on the big bag has already broken on each side, and the bottom covering is wearing off. I don't think I used the bag 'harder' then normal. I don't normally even use it that often. It gets packed on Mondays and taken to the baby sitters until Friday when I pick it up. So it's really only used on the weekends.However, the size of it is a plus. You can fit everything in it you need, including extra diapers and blankets that you can't fit in the small one.So over all I suggest getting a different bag. For the all the hassel I went through to get the straps back on, I would have liked to get a different bag but in the same size."
3,Cut 8. 'O' Berta' not the one I thought it was,"I heard a great arraingement of ""Berta"" during the movie ""The Piano"" which stared Charles Dutton. I thought that arraingement or at least some approximation was on this CD but it turns out that track 8 'O' Berta' is a disapointing version of that great tune. Otherwise if you like to hear these types of songs you might like this cd."
1,Does Not Work,"Purchased 2 of these zappers. Noticed that while I had flies, that there were no dead flies in the zappers themselves or for that matter around or under them. Then I noticed on both that when the room was dark, flies would actually enter the zapper walk all around inside and then fly away. Both with the same result. No malfunction on these devices, they simply don't work, there is no way Viatek could not know this. Do Not waste any time or money on this product."
1,Bug Zapper is worthless!,Bought two of these to zap the little gnats that fly in the kitchen. What I got was two neon lights that do nothing for the bug problem. note the high shipping fees....beware!
4,It does what it says for the price,"This bug zapper is good for flies, mosquitoes and moths. I orginally purchased it to rid gnats - no good for gnats they prefer the cider vinegar that I put into a jar with holes (like when we were kids) to the light.So I was pleased to see how well it did on other flying bugs.Definitely worth the money for not having to deal with the smell or goop of other traps."
1,Did not work for me,"I bought this and didn't catch a single bug after 2 months. A different device killed a bunch of flying insects, but then the florescent light burned out."
1,Useless junk! Has not catched one single bug in 2 years!,This thing is completely useless! It has not catched one single bug in 2 years. We just use it as a very expensive night light. It's a ripoff and a scam. Highly dissatisfied! reviewed by [...]
1,Zapper doesn't zap,Pretty useless. Watched flies and other bugs crawl through it without harm. Only very small insects seemed affected.
1,Does not zap anything,"The claim by Viatek is the bug zapper provides 100,000 hours of use. False claim. It does not do as advertised. Viatek Company in Florida does not back up product claims and states this item is on back order. They make it but they do not have any to sell apparently. 100,000 hours of use is 15 years. This does not even give one year."
2,Didn't select this book for my course,"I teach a computing ethics course at an area University. I did not select this book as my text when I reviewed texts for use in the Fall 2004 semester. I did choose Spinello and Tavani's new reader; but this book--like most of the predecessors Spinello has written--would drive my students nuts -- and they wouldn't know why. Bottom line: poorly written and not easy to read -- lots of tough sentence choices made. However, as with Spinello's other books, there are some points he makes that no other computing ethics texts' authors do make! So, I'll glean those points out of his text and present them to my students rather than force them to work their way through and around his prose."
2,stay away,i am very dipleased with this product.I had a great deal of difficulity in getting most fm stations and no weather station at all. I had to constantly move the radio to different locations with not much better results.The tv stations were not to bad at times and other times terrible.It looks nice and is light weight and can be plugged into a wall outlet. Other than that I cannot truly recommend this product
5,A fantastic introduction to a ancient tradition,"I cannot recommend this album highly enough. The artist gives a sensitive and virtuosic powerhouse of a performance. His well-chosen repertoire spans the gamut of Turkish Classical music, but it is highly enjoyable even for the newcomer to this tradition."
1,Very Dissapointed!,"A one star rating is too high for this product. This is a very poor quality, cheap looking product. The product itself was very damaged, & the packing was broker apart, which is a clear indication that the product was previously returned by someone else. I returned for a refund only. Based on the poor quality, I would not reorder."
1,Bosch JigSaw,"Jigsaw ran smoothly and worked well with good battery life and smooth operation. However, after a modest amount of weekend use it slowed down and then just stopped working. I opened the case and found that the motor had burnt out. The jigsaw had never been used hard. Very disappointing performance for an expensive jigsaw."
3,Essential Articles but very one sided,"This book has some great papers in it, but the editors really show their colors in the bioethics debate in the papers presented. For example the book presents a declaration by the Catholic Church denouncing euthanasia, but fails to present any of the background material that led to this declaration (or even references to it). It also presents a good number of papers that rely too heavily on anecdotes.To get a feel for Singer and Kuhse's (two very big names of the field) opinons the book is great. To get a balanced treatment of the bioethics debate, the book fails."
3,Bioetics,A good collection of philosophy papers. I wasn't that interested in it only b/c I am not interested in philosophy enough to truly appreciate the book.
5,Fresh,This Non-Prophets lp is it. Its different then Personal Journals which is great but its that style and wordplay on this cd. Its not as personal or deep. He hooks up with Joe Beats and creates a underground classic cd. They talk about how ridiculous this commercial b.s. is. Its a slept on classic that will never receive its just do. I dont know about you but I dont see Sage and Beats going on 106 and Park anytime soon you know. Its not their style its not BET's style either. Too bad because that BET is garbage. Underground needs a network but would that be contradictive?
4,Sage Francis + Joe Beats,"Hope is a very well rounded album. Lyrically, a bit of a departure from Personal Journals, but that is certainly the intention, as Sage has a different identity when partnered with Joe Beats. Sage tackles a maelstrom of personal and industry beefs, over hard hitting tracks occasionally assisted by Sixtoo. Hope is chock-full of metaphors, and may not necessarily make sense upon the first couple of times that you listen to the album, but this really does not detract from it overall. ""Spaceman"" is such an example, although the beat is dizzingly superb, and I'm fairly convinced that the track addresses a certain ex of Sage's. My favourite track is ""the cure"", which contrasts a lovers' pessimism from both gender- divided points of view."
4,NOT A FAN OF SAGE FRACIS BUT THE ALBUM WAS O.K.,"don't get me wrong,sage fracis has skill but it's just suntin' about that cat that doesn't sit well wit me.i usualy can't stand him,but on this album i could tolerate him.the production and the cuts were excellent.it took a few listens to get use to but slowly grew on me.i give it 4 stars for production alone,but then again i do have a bias.definately worth checking out though."
5,Woo yay,"This is what rap should be. Sage Francis has smooth, clear vocals, the samples and beats are from old jazz records and give the whole thing an old school feel. It feels more like slick beat poetry than rap, because it's witty and smart and isn't full of the bombastic egotistic pap that you'll hear in anything mainstream.I'm pleased to see he's deviated from the Anticon label, which is a hotbed for awkward time signatures, clumsy samples, and MCs with really really irritating vocals. This album sees Sage Francis as Sage Francis, as he should be, not as a puppet of the oft-pretentious self proclaimed art-hop label Anticon."
5,"A Surreal Thriller and Must Read, Sept. 01, 2003","A Surreal Thriller and Must Read, Sept. 01, 2003Nancy Kilpatrick author of ""The Power of Blood Series"" from St. Martin's PressWeber's Protocol 17 is a hard-boiled stew laced with gritty cop-shop, a euro-thriller and demons. Weber dishes out this supernatural concoction offering readers a palatable yet powerful feast noir.Look for his new anthology ""The Black Spiral: Twisted Tales of Terror"" to be released in Oct. 2003!! Featuring such talented authors as F.Paul Wilson, Ramsey Campbell, Mort Castle,Tim Lebbon, Robert Weinberg, Tina L. Jens, J. Knight and many more."
5,Wonderful! A thriller not to be missed!,"Mr. Weber's, DARK PROTOCOLS, is fast paced, exciting, thrilling, and awfully chilling. What I loved most about this novel were the characters and the mysterious plot. They both kept me guessing throughout the entire novel, and I must admit I never guessed right. My favorite character is THE OTHER, a combination of bad & good, but I'll not tell who or what the other is. Best to read it. Josey and Sam, of course, were wonderful. And I'd say they're perfect for each other, smart a**'s the both of them. Very enjoyable! I also loved hating the bad guy (s). Can't wait to read the next one...I'm thinking maybe something to do with Turin, Joesy, and Sam. Overall, a fine, entertaining read that I'm glad I didn't miss."
3,For Anthropologists Only,"As a huge fan of Alan Lomax and the other Southern Journey releases in the series, I was a bit disappointed with this one. There are some great tracks, but the variety of performers is extremely limited, and there are simply too many long unaccompanied ballads included. Undoubtedly, these songs are historically and culturally important, but it makes for rather tedious listening. And while I enjoy the banjo tunes and commentary, I find the fiddle playing too screechy and the guitar far too out of tune. I understand how easy it is to overmythologize folk artists, but one should be careful in doing so - just because it's 'folk' (and what does that word even mean?) doesn't mean it's good. Investigate 61 Highway Mississippi and Velvet Voices for recordings of a much higher quality. But don't necessarily ignore this one - just make sure you're really interested in the subject matter."
3,from guilt to drunks,"i enjoyed this story of two men who hurt their familes and became drunks because of guilt. mike was the worst of the two in my opinion. he was spoiled and had everything his way. he just kept hurting and hurting those he supposedly loved. i was glad they both gave their life to christ. it seems to me that mike would have made a strong influence to prison inmates, if he would have been allowed to live. i know that everyone has a place in heaven, if they repent, but it seems as if mike got a bye by dying. it just seemed too easy. jed never got over his guilt. he finally realized the harm he caused his wife and made amends. i was glad he and his wife were going to have a good life in christ"
2,OK but not great,"An OK book . . . not a lot of suspense. The story is more about God's forgiveness than anything else. I didn't find the main characters to be very likable, but I did like several of the people they came in contact with, including the small-town reputable news woman -- a very unusual kind of person in today's media world."
2,clunky,I did not enjoy this book at all but rather found the story and dialogue clunky and uninteresting at best. It began well but slowed in pace and petered out way before the end with far too much repitition of certain themes like angelic visitation
3,Antarctic History,"This book gives information on the history of Antarctica, providing information on place names across the continent. From those geographic points named by Ross, Palmer, Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton and other Antarctic explorers from the past to the present.While difficult to locate, this book has a great deal of information given in the historical context of when, why and how they were named."
4,standard catolog of 4x4's,I use this book as a reference tool for my business at Canadian four wheel drive magazine. I find the book to have a very complete listing of all standard options available to each vehicle going back to 1946. All mesurements and in some cases production totals and prices. Though I have found a few points missed the listings are very complete with each year of vehicle logicly laid out. If you want to know what came on your vehicle stock or one you are interested in this book will give you the information you are looking for. An over all good buy. Albert Vandervelde
5,Love it,If you are a 4x4 lover you will love this book. My husband and dad are always using this book for reference when building or servicing our fleet. Interesting reading for any vehicle person. I recommend it!
5,Winter in the Morning:A Young Girl's Life in a Warsaw Ghetto,"This book was intriguing. After forty years, the author, Janina Bauman, is ready to tell her story of her life and experiences in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust. The story begins telling what a good life Bauman has with her father as a doctor and a loving close Jewish family. Then as the story goes on the war begins and their town is transformed into a Jewish ghetto. They are forced slowly to move from place to place, within the ghetto, each one worse than the other. With her remaining family she escapes the ghetto only to find more problems along the way to freedom, but in the end everything works out. This book gives in excellent detail, Bauman's experiences of friendship, love, death, poverty, adventure, and family problems. Many of her personal diary entries are included also showing exactly how she was feeling. The story is full of adventure and feeling and it was a joy to read."
2,"Cute, but works terribly!","I upgraded to this phone and had problems with it the day after receiving it. It looks great and the graphics are amazing, but the reception is poor, the ringer is not loud enough (even when set on the maximum level), and the speaker is incredibly poor. All of my friends and family have a difficult time hearing me even when I'm yelling. If anything, this phone helped me cut down talk time because I get so frustrated using it. Perhaps it's just the phone that I got. Who knows?"
2,"Good performance, great on looks, buggy software","I got this phone through T-Mobile's upgrade program. For my 10/20-minutes-per-day usage, the phone works quite well. However there definitely are some glitches in the software of the phone. I had to return the first phone that I had got and am now on the second phone. The first phone (after about a month of usage) started shutting down randomly with no warning, sometimes in the middle of a call. That was hugely aggravating! They did replace the phone, but under T-Mobile's replacement program, I had to pay the shipping/handling charges (about $10.) What if this second phone of mine starts doing the same thing? In fact as I write this, I remember that once or twice in the last week, when I picked up the phone, it had shut down. Aaargh! Ah well, I can hope."
3,Batteries are too poor to be tolerated!,"This cell phone is okay except the battery is so poor, you have to charge it from time to time.Each charge will only go on for 2-3 days even with a low load of talking.I would transfer my next phone to nokia for a better battery time."
3,I'm already a bit dissapointed,I've only had this phone for a couple of days but I really wish the soft keys on the main screen were customizable. I always kept my alarm clock on the left and my recent calls on the right but now I'm stuck with T-Zones on one of them. I'm so annoyed that I'm thinking about returning it.
1,"horrible, had to switch 3 times","do not buy this. it drops incoming calls, does not allow you to make calls..I switched machines 3 times with t-mobile (paid for shipping each time) then had to buy another phone online (tmobile would not give me another type of phone!!)"
1,"Dont Like it,..............i prefer the SLVR",this is just a deliberate copy of the Motorola SLVR. dont get this phone. get the actual slvr instead
5,can't ever go wrong with bosch!!,"i very much like this product because it is a cordless product. it allows me mobility that i would otherwise not have using an electrical. hence, saving me much needed time on the job. i have yet to be disappointed with a bosch product. this one will indeed inhance my collection."
1,Conceededness in chess is my opinion of this book,"The Polgar's sisters written by a Polar sister. Kind of a self biography. I think that this book is somewhat self serving and in reality, though good as players non of them are or will be world championship material (talking about THE world championship, not a segragated girls championship). When it comes to a good book on woman's chess Jennifer Shahade's book ""Chess Bitch"" contains a non-watered down and more realistic version of top women's chess. It is very conceeded to write a book on how ""you"" changed the game of chess - not so true!"
5,The first family of chess,"What is the last reviewer talking about? There's no mentioning of Kosteniuk or Krush anywhere in the book. This book is about the lives of three Polgar sisters who made history. The author didn't use fancy words or complicated style. She's direct and candid with her views. I like this book very much. And by the way, there are plenty of nice analyzed games and combinations. Susan explained each move even from the first move. Nicely done! A high class book!"
5,Excellent book for all,A few weeks ago I bought breaking through. A recommendation for chess fans and a must for Polgarfans! What is unique is that the games which are discussed are annotated on E V E R Y single move from move one. There are also plenty of diagrams which make it even easier to follow. This makes the book excellent for 1200 till 2700 rated players. I've never seen a chessbook like that and have been waiting all my life for such an analysis format. Pity that book wasn't there years earlier for me. I would have been much better at chess! I love this book!
3,Breaking Through - Review,"The book I purchased was advertised as being new. It actually had been read by someone who highlighted some sentences with pencil marks.The book itself has a lot of very interesting information about the lives of these incredible sisters. It devotes a good bit of space to actual chess games. Personally, I would like to see more text about their lives. The games may be instructive for advanced players who want to follow them on a chess board, but they didn't appeal to me."
5,Nice book,I like this book very much. The stories of the sisters are inspiring. They basically revoluntionized women's chess and raised it to another level. The games are also well annotated. It's a very good book overall. It's nice to hear the personal accounts of their lives and challenges.
5,a great book from a wonderful person,"Let me start of by saying I am not much of a reader, but when I received a copy of this book I was moved. The honesty in this book and the references are on point. I have gone to many of these places myself and done a lot of the things said in this book and they are just like kathy said they were. I find this book a good reference when I am bored and have nothing better to do. It also helped me when I had company and didn't know what to do with them. I took them to a few places that the book said to and then I gave them the book and they just had a blast. I recommend this to everybody even the locals who think they know everything about this town(I used to be one of them) its so informational that its kind of mind blowing that kathy took her time to study and find all of these places. Thank you kathy for a wonderful book and I hope there are many more to come."
4,Worth a read! Worth a look!,"This is a second hand edition, a couple of years old. We in Australia and this book is not avalable here. We have purchased this book to a get a fix on Las Vegas to make a short holiday effective. The cost was $3.50 plus postage. My children and I have been able to read it together and use it as a guide with the current internet info and other books. Seems to be a reasonable resource, wouldn't buy if I had to pay full price, but would borrow it from a library. It gives a good grasp on activities, price and value. As well as being mindful of ""Vegas"",for example suggests a particular venue and street, but identifies the nightlife that your children maybe exposed to on the way to the venue. Hmmmmm - Maybe I would pay full price."
5,Blending cultures,"I chose this book to introduce my children to literature written about Korean culture in America. We love the parallels to our life- a Halmoni living far away, a young girl nervous about school and fitting in with her classmates, and especially that the title character shares her Korean name with my daughter! This story crosses cultural differences to embrace the concepts of family love, friendship, cultural sensitivity and self esteem. What a wonderful story!The Name Jar"
4,Great Character Lesson!,"Great way to talk about people's difference, cultures, and ways to show respect to one another. Will use it next year in my classroom at the beginning of the year to help create a classroom that shows respect to one another."
3,Take With A Grain Of Salt,"I don't think that this is the best book for an example of how colonialism still continues to have an effect on the mentality of those whose ancestors were subjected to it or are currently being subjected to it. The existence of Willie Lynch is questionable and there really wasn't a letter so to speak but even if there was, the practices of colonialism predated the suggested time in which Willie Lynch supposedly composed it. When people are brutalized long enough they adopt the practices of those who brutalized them, they continue to brutalize themselves because the behavior has been internalized and unless there is a break in the cycle of self brutalization it perpetuates itself into various social ills. This issue is detailed in more informative books than this one. The psychology of colonialization affects a great many people not just African Americans, and this book does little to address how this is still a global issue."
4,Important Guide to Follow,"It is a very good guide to go by daily. Marc Sims doesn't tell you how to act. However, he addresses the issues that African Americans face and personal reasons as to why. Of course, there is no evidence that Willie Lynch ever existed. However, it doesn't ignore the fact that these issues subsist."
3,Solid,"Now, if you made it this far, don't stop reading quite yet. You are lucky to have stumbled upon the absolute cream of delta blues artists (and perhaps the best blues slide guitarist of all time). I came upon an old record of McDowell in a used record store and have been hooked ever since. That said, this is a solid record, but not his best. For an introduction to McDowell's beautiful, soulful acoustic guitar pieces, try his ""You Gotta Move"". Not only are the performances better, you get almost 30 more minutes of music on ""You Gotta Move"". Good listening!"
4,excellent,"Kev's a producer's producer. Crazy at chopping up the samples, has great percussion, and his bass lines are tremendous. He's a master of his craft. Sounds great over his own beats too. Kenn Starr and Phonte have nice guest appearances. Highly recommend it"
2,OH WELL!,"For me this was more bland, predictable, basic tracks. Types of lyrics that been said over and again. Representing and the like. Nothing significant, maybe one track that threw a spark. I am highly disappointed and expected so much more. He kept saying LOW BUDGET and when it sounds like it you don't really need to emphasize. Repeating your name all over the tracks back to back producer or not is one thing but when you are the artist it is obvious who you are or are you trying to convince yourself you are credible.I did buy the CD, Mr. Brown, but I will try to sell it as well,"
5,YETANOTHERCLASSIC!,"So many classics have dropped this year it's hard to keep up.First you have quasimoto's""the further adventure...."",Common's""BE"",9th wonder&Buckshot's""Chemistry"",Little Brother's""The Minstrel Show"",Kanye West's""Late Registration""and many others.Now you can add yet another classic to the mix and that cd my fellow hip-hoppas is KEV BROWN'S""I DO WHAT I DO"".No need to talk about the album,just ""GO COP DAT PIECE,SON"".Hip-Hop is back in the building(sorry rocafella)don't it feel good!!??"
3,It isn't ab's of steel,"It is hard to be objective, I keep comparing new videos to the classic ab's of steel. It just isn't on par with that, I haven't found anything that is.... This video has 3 segments that include a warm up and a stretch. Segment 1 is buns, segment 2 works the inner and outer thigh and segment 3 works the front and back of the thigh, the calves and more (the shin).What I like: 1)The warm up and cool down. 2)My butt hurts the next day, so I know it works.What I don't like: 1)The excercises are not intuitive (I still don't know if I am doing them correctly). 2)TamiLee has you use a rag or plastic baggie on the floor so you can slide, which doesn't work very well for me (I wear a sock on the carpet). 3)TamiLee sounds like an idiot.I am going to stick with it for several months to see if my opinion changes, right now I am kicking myself for not getting the original buns of steel instead!"
2,Basic & Typo Central...,"I was hoping to get much more from this book based on the author's reputation, but the material is basic at best. It's more of a Ghost Hunting 101 pre-course. What was extremely irritating about this book was the number of typos. It seemed almost every page contained a typo that any fifth grader could have picked up on. The horrible editing on this book was a real distraction."
2,Longwinded,"I respect Loyd Auerbach immensely, but the chapters in this book are so longwinded when it comes to psi abilities that it leaves non-psychic investigators out of the loop. I understand that Mr. Auerbach is a mentalist but when writing a book with the subcaption: How to Investigate the paranormal, you'd expect it to be for people of non-psychic ability as well.Overall the book is informative if you have ""medium"" abilities but does little for the regular investigative scientist."
4,"Rookie Hunters, this is the book for you.","For all of you who want to start ghost hunting, read this book first. It will tell you all about how to go about it. What to ask, what not to ask etc. Just don't go in to 'investigate' when you don't have to. Read this book, and you'll know what I mean."
3,I've read better...,This book was pretty boring to me and very difficult to stay interested in. I didn't really get much out of it that I haven't found in other books that are more interesting and exciting to read.
2,This kind of was not what it should have been,"While interesting, I get the distinct impression anyone that has seen Ghost Busters could write it."
5,ThIs GiRl Is GoNnA BlOw Up!,"I know ya'll have listened to this Cd, and I know ya'll have heard that song"" 4,5,6"" you can't help but to sing a long cause ya kow this song is PHAt! WHen I first heard her with J.T Money on that track "" Who dat"" I know this girl had what it takes to get somewhere in this rap game."
4,six tracks...,"As far as I can tell, the sound is nicer on this release than the old Legacy ""Negro Prison Blues and Songs,"" but unfortunately there are six (really good) tracks at the end of that CD that aren't on vol. 1 or 2 in the Rounder set. I think it's worth it to get the older Legacy release, and then vol.2 from Rounder to have it all. These are astounding compilations."
4,Compelling to the End,"The beginging of the book had a slow, mediocore rhythm to it, but that quickly passed into the making of a great novel. It taught a great moral and showed Watkins' great work and capability."
5,The Young Man & The Sea,"I thoroughly enjoyed this poignant and earthy novel of contemporary sea life - a modern day classic that wrestles with the angst of adolescence, chronicles the siren call of the sea - it's seductive rhythms, drama and dangers, and addresses the coming-of-age transition of young adulthood with its inherent and conflicting forces of rejection and acceptance. At the heart of the writer's understated style lies a belief in the humanity of man, in the quiet strength and unspoken virtue within, that lends a certain dignity to his characters. Recommended to all who enjoyed the book THE PERFECT STORM."
3,nice revisitation to friday night pizza and Dr Pepper zombie movie-ism,"Nightmare City (City of the Walking Dead) is a good and pretty satisfactory retread of the zombie-gore formula. the plot is, naturally, unimportant. but this time it's radiation zombies, and you get to see the murderers in the form of regular looking people to really messed up in makeups that look like those mexican circus performer brothers with thick fur all over they're bodies that show up on Ripley's Believe it or not occassionally. The gore is good (stabbings, breast and eye-gougings, an arm shot off), and there is a lot of (good) female nudity. The music and the scenery is also pleasant. Hats off to Lenzi for that suspenseful plane landing at the beggining of the film. Recommended."
2,only two stars but entertaining in its absurdity,"my sister saw mel ferrar was in this movie and thought it couldn't be ALL bad. i saw mel ferrar and figured he was desperate for a job. guess who was right? okay.....it's total cheese, but sometimes that's what makes these movies watchable. my favorite scene -- husband and wife are running from the zombies in a car....they realize they need gas.....they stop at a deserted gas station....and proceed to go inside to enjoy a cup of coffee! they actually took the time to make it AND comment on how it's not the best because it's only instant coffee. if that's not a ""b"" movie moment, i'm not sure what is."
2,Reeaaallly Looong Fiilm!!!,"Hello World,Took me 4 nights to get through this little gem. Just didnt do it for me. If you get it used chek it out and dont expect too much. Look to ""Demons"" for gore and a decent story. This was really lacking and drawn out and over predictable. Although, this is were the World ""1st"" sees fast moving zombies!!!!!!!! This is a first and yes the Italians developed it. As they did pizza and pasta. Dammmmmn I love Italian foood.FJE"
1,a real low point in Italian horror,"I first saw this Spaghetti cheese-fest back in 1997 and thoroughly hated it. I rented it again recently (as I had gotten into Fulci and Argento) and hated it just as much. Umberto Lenzi's ham-fisted attempt at a horror/zombie movie falls flat on pretty much every account, basically because it's so lazy. The story centers around a reporter and his doctor wife on the run from a plague of mutant zombies (who can run around and brandish weapons, ha!) as the military attempts to combat the situation. Maybe if Lucio Fulci was directing and Giannetto De Rossi was doing the makeup, ""City of the Walking Dead"" might have actually been pretty good, but it isn't, and it really sucks. I never thought I'd have to see a movie where it looked like the actors needed lessons on ""how to be a zombie."" Even if you're a fan of Italian horror, you'd be better off skipping over this."
1,only one thing missing from this movie. plot.,Nothing but mindless violence and extravagant nudity. i would never watch it again.
2,The Nightmare becomes reality from the first frame onwards,"Umberto Lenzi, the king of Italian exploitation films, attempts to mix the Cannibal genre with the fear of Nuclear disaster. A plane lands at the airport and humans mutated into grotesque cannibals by an atomic cloud run out and start massacring everyone in sight. A reporter and his wife flee only for her to fall to her death off a roller coaster. He wakes up. It was all a dream. He goes to the airport that morning. The screen freezes with ""The nightmare becomes reality"" written across in big red letters. The reality of the matter is that the nightmare became reality for the viewer as soon as the movie started rolling. This film escapes a 1 star because of some decent gory special effects that will make most cringe in disgust."
3,"The Cheese, My God the Cheese!","This movie is absolutely hilarious. For one, the make-up on the zombies is SO poor. They don't put make-up around the eyes, and so the zombies end up just looking like guys wearing hamburger meat masks. Secondly, the zombies run around and use weapons! Sorry, but these types of zombies only work well when done comedically (i.e. Return of the Living Dead). The throat slashings also look incredibly fake. Nonetheless, this film is great fun in all its cheesiness. It has plenty of gore, even if it doesn't near Fulci quality. The only gore that really impressed me was an awesome scene where a girl gets her breast cut open by a zombie, who then scoops out the contents and eats! The classic Lenzi breast torture (see Cannibal Ferox) is in full swing here! If you want a good gory laugh, check this out. If you wanna see Lenzi at his best though, go for Cannibal Ferox."
3,Buy it for a good laugh,"OK so im not going to dwell on aspects of this movie that havent been touched by other reviewers. In essence this is the cheesiest zombie movie you will ever see. The concept is pretty original and interesting a plane lands with infected people that have been turned them into zombies. What is cool about these zombies is that they don't bite or rip your flesh off. Instead, check this out, THEY KICK YOU ASS. That's right they use anything in hand to inflict physical harm on humans. One even uses martial arts to surmount his prey. Now why they do this, isnt ever really revealed in this movie. But it becomes fun after awhile. The makeup effect are decent not the best but it survives as a horror movie. I would buy this movie just because its genere but Id enjoy because of its retro and cheesey unique approach to the zombie culture."
2,A complete waste of time,"I rented ""City of the Walking Dead"" expecting it to be similar to Lucio Fulci's masterpiece ""Zombie."" I was horribly disappointed to find ""City of the Walking Dead"" to be one of the most boring experiences I have subjected myself to. The zombies or whatever they are are more like mindless vampires preying on the blood of the inhabitants of the city. They have disfigured mutilated faces, but look ridiculous rather than convincingly scary. Don't watch unless you are a serious masochist."
4,A real piece of work,"Lenzi has created an exploitation film to remember. Random violence permeates this zombie epic. Simple plot, but much action for your little peepers to indulge. My main disappointments with this movie were: there were no intestines unravelled (one scene came close, but they cut out to the next scene before we could see the visceral victuals), the ending was one of those ""OH,IT WAS ALL A DREAM"" sort of cop-outs, and the neck slashing scenes were rather weak and unconvincing--a simple line of red just doesn't get me off anymore. The boobage was fair and supple. As a late adolescent man, I can still appreciate it. The zombies talked, but it didn't make the movie goofy like RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. This movie is best watched with a person who doesn't like zombie films--such as my girlfriend. True zombie fans, pay up and enjoy, those who like movies like RESIDENT EVIL, eat it and go somewhere else."
5,"Seems well built, does its thing","My headset never leaves my car, so the wall charger that it came with is nearly useless. Picked up one of these a while back and it has worked great. Makes a nice solid connection to the headset and does its thing."
4,"Hey, it works!","Nothing super-spectacular about it, except for the price. It's just a decently-made charger, and it works. 'Nuff said. BTW, it DOES NOT come with the vent clip or any other accessories--this is JUST the charger."
4,Does what is supposed to do,"Does what is supposed to do...I think it could be better in saving energy, because the led is turned on even without the hands free connected to it."
4,Adapter Car Lighter Explorer,I was happy to find this item on Amazon. I wanted a second one for traveling.I got it in good shape.
4,Interesting info on talented actor,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I bought this book, but it turned out to be pretty interesting. I had no idea that Mr. Wood had been acting for so long, and had accomplished so much. Certainly by comparison to DiCaprio, Wood has shown much greater breadth and range of acting. A lot of the book was predictible, [...] but it did cover the basics--biography, filmography, pictures, and trivia. Hopefully this won't be the last book written about this talented young actor!"
4,Pray and Play bible 2,"Very simple, complete, to the point and full of fun for pre-schoolers. More of a product for sunday school or groups than for home use. Overall it's great!"
1,unused full book,It is the unused full book for me and I recommend that don't spend your money for this book.
