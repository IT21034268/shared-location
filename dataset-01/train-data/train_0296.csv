2,American Trash,This movie is so overrated. The acting is good but its not that good. PLease how do people see beauty in a dead bird and a mans head shot with blood coming out. The nudity was pointless and disturbing. Underage girls breast is not beauty in this way more disguisting.
1,Not entertaining,"How can anyone give this movie 5 stars? My wife and I watched it and I felt like apologizing to her about halfway through. We were not entertained at all. If you like dark twisted movies, you'll love this one. For the rest of us, I'd recommend saving your money."
2,Annoying,"After watching David Lynch's masterpiece A Straight Story I had the misfortune of sitting through American Beauty. I liked Kevin Spacey's performance, except for his idiotic monologue at the end. This is one of those movies that make me talk back to the screen, with insulting remarks. Move it along, director! Shoddy work can't be excused by inventive plot twists. Yes, it's politically correct to dislike the ex-marine who smacks his kid around, collects guns, and is a hard nose, and sure it's easy to take the cheap shot at this caricature and call him a closet queen. You may think this is cutting edge, but I think it's just a cheap shot at an obvious target. I couldn't stand the movie before most of this happened, so my dislike goes deeper than just this. This is just not a quality job. The director just did a lousy job. That's my reaction."
4,Wow Cool! Moive so Smarty and Cool and Sex,"This moive is so funny especially when Kevin Spacy is plesuring his self--that is so funny!!!! I like when the kids talk dirty. That one girl is so HOT! I think Kevin Sacy should of had sex with her though. That would of been better. Also I liked the older lady getting sex in the motel!!!! That was so funny! And the part when it looks like the two males are doing something dirty threw the window! There is lots of funny sexy stuff in this moive that I love it amost as much as American Pie, my other favorite moives. SEE THIS MOIVE!!!"
1,Original? I think not - Yawn,"Two stars for actor performances, the production work et al which is great. However the true meat of a movie is the story and this was a case of chopped pork rather than loin. Suburban bored miserable middle aged man, burned out wife who hates him, the terrible temptation he could not resist, disaster. A plot found in a million books and a million magazines, not exactly ground breaking stuff. Not terrible just a little ordinary in my opinion and not really worth the effort."
5,One of the greatest movies ever told.,"Words can not describe the emotions that I feel when I view this move. Having grown up watching an untold number of horror and action flicks, my mind and soul have become immune to all forms of compasiion and understanding. In the past ten years, the only movies that I have been touched by have been Schindlers List, Magnolia, and Platton, and now American Beauty. I laughed, sat at the edge of my seat, and cried for the eniterty of the film. When I left the theater my emotions were so mixed up that I did not know how to feel. But this is a good thing. I recomend this movie to anyone who has been rendred a heartless zombie, by hundreds of action movies,and think that they need some sort of feelings to remind themselves that they are still alive. Please excuse my spelling."
1,Bad Movie,"I can't belive this film won any awards it ripped off so many films before it.To summerize.A used up idea done once again but this time since it was released by a big studio were all suppose to respect it.The film is trying to be artsy but it tries too hard and in obvious ways.In my opinion its the most overrated film to have won the oscar for best picture and to top it off its really bad writting,done in a predictable manner.If you want to see a good movie that it ripped off watch Interiors,Ordinary People,Sunset Blvd,Blue Velvet,and there are many others you can look up."
3,"""Huh?""","This movie came up in conversation today and I remembered I had bought it because I really like Kevin Spacey and because it won Oscar for Best Picture. So I watched it and am really weirded out. This is a 1999 movie and when it was made, I would have been exactly Kevin Spacey's character's age. Having undergone one myself, I totally understand his midlife crisis and somehow, even his solution. The Burnhams are very real due to the acting talents of Spacey and Bening; however, the movie is unreal. Or is it the other way around? There are so many inter-connections and twists and turns, yet it's predictable at the same time. At least there are only 6 major characters to deal with: two married couples and two teens, the couples' children, no less.I'm giving this 3 stars because it's close, on the positive side, to 2 and 1/2 stars: totally midpoint since I am so muddled and ambivalent about this movie."
3,Less than the sum of its parts.,"When first viewed in theatre, I was favorably impressed with this film, not the least of which because of the Oscar-deserving Kevin Spacey. Upon repeat viewings at home, I have to say that it does not hold up. The performances are fine, with the exception of an over-the-top Annette Benning, but the high-handed and the pretentious (the swirling paper in slow motion) treatment by director/writer Mendes of the theme - the illusion that is the American dream - eventually gets under one's skin. The subject matter is a worthy one, I just wish that it had been done with more originality and panache..."
5,Where's all the xtra stuff?!?!?!?!?!,"Great movie! Kevin Spacey is awesome! One thing bothers me though . . . Where are the deleted scenes? The movie was suppose to start in a courtroom setting. The movie even had an alternate ending. Not saying they should have changed such a great movie, but at least include them on the DVD, considering its one of the reasons DVD was created."
4,"Pretty Good, But Once Is Enough","American Beauty is not an easily viewed movie. It's depressing and tragic. It has a nice touch of dark comedy that is quite good, but, there's just something that makes this movie viewable more than once. Kevin Spacey plays a middle aged suburban dad who goes through one hell of a midlife crisis. He quits his job and starts to fall for his daughter's cheerleader girlfriend. Annette Bening plays his harried wife. The actors are all really, really good. Spacey is phenomenal. But, the ending, I don't want to go there. This is a movie that a lot of people are not going to get or will want to watch at all. They should see it at least once. This might not be their cup of coffee or views on how life is, but it's interesting nonetheless."
3,American Beauty,"The script for this film is galactically smart, but the movie really took me by surprise. I think the film is worthy of a view; however, it is a film that some will hate and some will love. The fact that Alan Ball was able to hit upon a subject that affects us in such extremes is really a compliment to him. Having said that, I question the value in a movie such as this one. I don't think it's for everyone. My recommendation is to read the well-thought out reviews in this section and decide for yourself is this is your definition of ""entertainment""."
4,Wonderful satire,"This is a brilliant satire on middle America and an exhilarating exploration of what is ""normal"" and ""ordinary"". The central character (Spacey) embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery and liberates himself from a pointless marriage, a pointless job, and a pointless lust for a Lolita-type schoolgirl --...The only jarring element here is the parodistic military man next door. Spacey is superb and the direction is excellent."
5,American what??,"An excellent parody for the neurotic and borderline lifestyle of many people in the modern times (not only of Americans). A wealth of personality traits and psychosocial responses in one single movie. For those knowledgeable in psychology, it must be a fascinating experience to watch this movie, and to find out how perfectly it correlates with the troubled lifes of many individuals living in the ""civilized world"" and particularly in high developed societies. (Read the DSM IV and find out for yourself) A superb production, well worth seeing more than once, with an open mind, of course!"
3,Great Movie but incomplete DVD,"Several people have commented about missing elements on this DVD. If you listen to the commentary audio track, there are several mentions of the outtakes. Oddly enough, they are missing from the DVD. It is also painful to navigate to specific scenes. All in all, the DVD looks slapped together."
5,Warning - may not work with all DVD players,"This is an excellent film, don't miss it.However, if you own a Panasonic A-110 DVD player this film will NOT load. I purchased the player about two years ago. This is the first problem I have ever had with a DVD and I have about 50 of them.The sad thing is it works fine on my notebook PC, which only has a 14 inch screen and ""tinny"" speakers.I don't expect this review to help those who want to know about the movie, I just want to provide information to consumers that the film may not work on older players."
2,What's the big deal?,"I heard so much hype about this movie in the fall of 1999! Even in Russia! I knew that I had to see it. I saw it, and vowed to never watch it again. The dialogue and acting was beyond superb but the storyline was not very good. The fact that it explored suburban dysfunction was nice, but all of the sex and vulgarity turned me off. There were a few funny moments in the movie, (ex: The family eating dinner together and Col. Fitts 'homophobe-ness'). Overall, not worth all the hype."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"Few films have that cult genre, mystic philosophic appeal, world-class acting, tantilizing music, and overall top notch production qualities all rolled into one. American beauty brings fringe movie making thought to the main screen. One of the few movies I can watch more than once (this and Starship Troopers)."
1,Complete waste of my time.,"What is this crap? If you're into artsy-fartsy movies you'll like this. I say, leave symbolism to the symbol-minded!The Oscars are smoking something."
1,A Sick Movie About Sick People,"I had wanted to see this movie ever since it came out but when I did go see it I didn't like what I was watching. My brother, two friends, & I went and saw this two weeks after it's release. I was the only one of us four who saw the entire film. My brother fell asleep, one of my friends walked out & the other bought a ticket for another movie. It was a disgusting picture that shouldn't have won anything. The characters were gross and obnoxis. No one I know enjoyed it and the as for the touching part at the end I didn't even notice anything touching or spirtual about it."
3,I can' t get this DVD to play!,"I have tried with two different discs to get this DVD to play in my Toshiba DVD player. I have never had any problems with any other discs, including discs that were skipping in other players. This disc will not load and the player says ""Check Disc."" My player is not DTS equiped. All of the copies I have seen have the DTS sound.Has anyone else had this problem? Does anyone have a solution?"
1,The Emperor's New Rose,"I know I am in a distinct minority, but I intensely disliked this film. Satire works best when the creator loves his characters, flaws and all. Alan Ball clearly despised his creations, and I echo his sentiment. There is much about middle-class suburban life that lends itself to ridicule, but there is also room for intelligence, compassion and wit, qualities I find all but absent from American Beauty. Being invited to smirk at and feel superior to freaks -- this is art?"
4,"Not the Greatest Video Quality, But Not Bad","Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was better than I expected, after reading some of the reviews. It wasn't the greatest, but not the worst either. I give it 7.5 to 8.0 on a 10 point scale. The lowest score I have ever given a Blu-Ray is 4.0.The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was adequate (there just wasn't a lot of surround sound in this movie, except for the background music).After watching the Blu-Ray, I put in the DVD. The Blu-Ray is better, but not a whole lot better. Both the Blu-Ray and DVD appeared to be 2.35:1, with black bars on the top and bottom (the way I like movies to be). The DVD appeared dark in some scenes.Overall, I am happy with this Blu-Ray purchase, because I really like this movie."
5,Dark Comedy about Middle America,"A dark comedy, about suburban life. Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey give outstanding performances as a very un-happily married couple. Their lives are falling down around them, they are each having their own crisis, and everything just snowballs. Somewhere along the way, someone could have taken hold of the situation, but no one does as their lives spin out of control. Its a dark commentary on the lives of a suburban family. Wonderful performances by all the actors in the film."

1,5 Oscars for This???!!!,"I absolutely HATED this movie! I'm years late in viewing it but decided to rent it since it got such rave reviews and critical acclaim.#1 - The title doesn't fit the story#2 - The storyline is all over the place and the movie has no sound direction as to where it's going and why??#3 - Sad, morbid ending for no reason, pointless satire and just a horrible storyline all together.I started to turn the movie off before it ended but I was curion to see how it turned out since it got so many Oscars. I thought I was missing something...I wasn't."
1,Dissapointment,Do these people even play these movies before they sell them....Recieved this today and it won't even play in my DVDplayer or my Blueray...It is just a waste of time to me to go through the refund process so this gets A 0 out of ten!!Waste of time and Money Thanks alot..I really appreciate it!
1,American Beauty,"I thought this was a ""B"" rated trash movie. What a disappointment. Kevin Spacy is such a great actor - this was a total waste of his talent. I cannot believe it won the oscars it did!"
1,Ummm... what is the hype?,"I saw this move thinking ""wow this should be great"" i truely didn't get what was sooo good about it, i watched it 10 times thinking maby i missed something, I DIDN'T i really think these should be burned, folks this movie is weird with a poor script it is has no one story line. I am a huge fan of movies and can at least say something nice about a movie but not this one. A WASE OF TIME!"
3,Its not so good for 5 Oscars!,"Well its a quite originall story but it doesnt deserve the Oscar for best Acor and Picture! I dont understand why everybody loves that movie! ""Cider House Rules"" or ""Green Mile"" where much better than that the movie and the actors were much better! But at least A.Benning dindnt won the award oh, and what happened to her baby I didnt heard anything about it AFTER the oscarnight! Afterall the Poster looks good!"
5,"If you loved the movie, you will adore the DVD.","The DVD of the great film, American Beauty has a side table of fun digital toys. The director commentary over the whole film helps the viewer receive an ""in the mind of director"" angle. Sam Mendes's dry wit is enjoyable for a second viewing. There is a production video included, which is rather colorful. And (something any movie maker would enjoy) the writer and director walk through the story boards and picture stills, explaining further the thought process behind American Beauty. As a special bonus, if you own a DVD-Rom there is a program runable on your PC. If you loved the movie, you will adore the DVD."
1,Bizzare,"As I watched this movie, my reaction went from ""ok, this could still be ok"" to ""nah...doesn't do it for me"". I know that this is supposed to be a ""dark"" comedy, but I totally found it to be disturbing and I disliked all of the characters. Kevin Spacey's acting is great, but his character totally going for his daughter's girlfriend made me sick. I am trying to understand that it can be a fantasy for this middle-aged, exhausted man to lust after a high school girl, but that is called rape usually. I think that in showing all the dysfunction in family life it is a sad commentary instead of something to be revered or laughed at.Don't waste your time with this movie. If you have never seen it before and want to get it out of curiosity, I beg you to not waste your time because it is not funny or interesting, but truly disturbing."
3,Upon review...,"I really loved this movie the first time I saw it in theaters. However, when I watch it now the Kevin Spacey character just seems a bit...creepy to me. It is hard for me to romanticize this middle-aged man's shallow sexual desire for a sixteen-year-old girl. Even his decision at the end doesn't really redeem him in my eyes. Also, the Wes Bentley character may be the warmest, fuzziest, most conscientious drug-dealer in history. As for the DVD, it is OK. The extras basically amount to the PR company gushing over how great the film is without too much real insight into the making of it."
3,Spacey's performance makes overrated film worth a rent.,"Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening both give great performances in this dark comedy-drama. The director, Sam Mendes, comes straight from Broadway, and you can tell. The movie feels like a play. It starts out with Spacey narrating, giving us a tour of his town á la ""Our Town"". The direction has its good and bad points. The acting is terrific, but the movie feels claustrophobic. Perhaps you are supposed to feel trapped on that stage of suburbia, but that conflicts with some of the aerial cinematography that would suggest otherwise. In any case, this is the story of a failed marriage and a father who tries to become close with his insecure daughter who ends up dating a creepy guy, so perhaps this might not be your best choice for a family outing. However, this movie is favored to win several Golden Globe awards, including Best Actor (Spacey) and Best Picture. Three stars. Josh Bob says check this out...on video."
5,one of the best of 1999,"1999 was a great year, if not the best year in movies ever, and american beauty earning the oscar for best picture is debatable by many. all i gotta say about that is it deserved it far more than cider house rules...i don't know how that movie even got nominated, but that's a different story. 1999 had a whole bunch of great movies, but probably none better than american beauty. some have argued that it really doesn't show a mid-life crisis well, but the thing about it is, it's not meant to show a mid-life crisis well; it's trying to show the vanity in materialism, in living a world because we are taught to live in the world a certain way, which causes us to miss the beauty around us. can we truly stop and smell the roses? this movie is great for this point, enjoy the beauty around you. God made us a world to enjoy, let's not just fly by without taking a peek, and let's not ruin it by vainly scratching for the best 4000 dollar couch."
5,the ultimate oddball masterpiece now on blu-ray.......,"this movie has no genre because life has no genre. it's funny, it's moving, witty so much that it feels like a true story. it's about looking past the conventional beauty and closer to the subtle dynamics that is the human condition. i almost cry at the part when ricky zooms his camera past the conventionally attractive angela doing a stripper pose because he'd rather see jane's subtle smile in the vanity mirror. it's about things and people who are not what they appear to be on the surface. some of the best performances ever seen on a movie screen. it's so human it feels like a play, but still has some high-concept cinematic flair in its own right."
2,Just Complete Rubbish.,"'American Beauty' is just complete rubbish from beginning to end. It pretends to be deep and profound, but it is actually shallow and manipulative. It tires to find quick and easy solutions to people's problems and does not consider the long term conquences. For example, the main character (Kevin Spacy) quits his professional job to work in a fast-food resturant. At first he may enjoy it, but how long could he sustain that lifestyle. How long could he be happy working minimum wage. Also, his daughter is ready to run away with her drug-dealer boyfriend. How long do you think such a relationship could last? The movie does not consider these consequences. Think about the characters' actions and apply them to real life and you will realize 'American Beauty' is full of crap."
3,Moments of brilliance but lack of focus,"Well, the film doesn't move me as much as I thought it should. It begins nicely with moments of black comedy that bring the great 1989 film ""War of the Roses"" to mind. But it gets more and more somber and ponderous towards the end. The performances are an odd mixture: Annette Benning, Kevin Spacey, and Mena Suvari are energetic and satirical, while Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper are so low key and deadened it seems they belong in a different movie. The various scenes involving voyeurism, teenage drug use, homophobia, would-be patricide just don't come together in a cohesive, meaningful whole. In the end, the film, like the characters in it, simply gropes around for a resolution. The film does have brilliant performances by Benning and Spacey, and some memorable dialogs (""Our marriage is just a commerical for telling people how normal we are""). But a tighter and more focused narrative, and more satire and irony throughout would yield better results."
3,Off beat satire on dysfunctional family values,"The world loves this film and so did the Academy giving it eight nominations (including undeserved ones for Editing and Score) and Oscared it five times (Film, Actor- Spacey, Director, Cinematography and Screenplay). I can see the noms for Spacey and Bening. I can even see a nom for Screenplay, but there it stops. This film was merely diverting and interesting - it was in no way the best film of the year. Politics at play once again. When it was over I was not enlightened, intrigued or uplifted. It was a diversion - no more, no less. Wes Bentley impressed as a newcomer but other than that.... it's not a great film, I predict it will be quickly forgotten."
3,"Finally, Gay issues explored nicely -","To be honest I really didn't understand this movie. I was quite confused by all the supposed subtexts and layers of the various characters. But one aspect of the film that really touched me, as an adult homosexual, were the scenes involving the (apparently) gay-hating father and how he treats his son, only to learn that he has lived a life of pain hiding his own homosexuality. I can relate to this. Although not in the military, I've had to deal with the pain and internal conflict of dealing with my homosexuality in a homo-hating world. It's not easy, but like the charcter in the movie, I often deal with things similarly - lashing out, criticizing others, trying to make up for my own shortcomings. What a powerful characterization. I recommend this movie to all gay (and of course straight) men."
5,American Beauty,"American Beauty was a truly unusual film which demonstrated that gay couples can be the best-adjusted, most mellow people. The other characters showed family values of family friction and family violence which heteros cutely call ""domestic"" violence to avoid associating their sacred ""family"" with violence. Heteros should concentrate or being nice to other heteros and being tolerate of those not born hetero. FAMILY VIOLENCE is not a boon."
1,American Tragedy,"It is a sad note for our country when this type of sordid tale wins multiple Oscars including Best Picture of the Year. This film is a depressing story about sick, dysfunctional people and their ways of coping. Is there anything uplifting about it? Not that I can see. Do we really need to see a movie featuring:The father (Lester) lusts and fantasizes over his daughter's teenage friend;The friend (Angela) talks using the raunchiest language imaginable;The neighbor is a drug dealer who is beaten by his own dad, sells to Lester and has a voyeuristic fetish with his video camera;The wife has an affair with a rival business owner and ultimately murders her husband.These people and their real-life counterparts need the gospel message of Jesus Christ. He is the only answer. Stories like this are examples of what happens when people go in the opposite direction."
4,Americans are seriously ill,I appreciate this new style movie.All the people in this film are perverse. And many Americans in the real world share the perversion. It's the reason why this satire became so popular.What makes me uncomfortable is the popularity. I hope it should have been recognized as an artistic work or a cult movie.
1,Why Best Pcture?,I do not own & will never own this film. I saw it on HBO. I was not thrilled to see about half the cast drop their clothes. The Insider should have been best picture over this mess.
1,...just plain mediocre,"This is the kind of film that Europeans love about America: it has every single ridiculous stereotype about suburban life, from hiding your true feelings from the neighbors to gun-totting nut cases who beat their children.It was so bad that I was stunned at the attention it got. Not a single scene or emotion rings true. Is this, along with film versions of cartoons and old TV shows, the best that Hollywood can do?"
3,An American Beauty,"This movie is good, entertaining, and funny. With a good storyline and worthy acting make this one a winner...barely."
5,one of the finest,"i can't remember the last time i saw a movie that shook me so much. it just grabs you and reels you in...being both ugly and beautiful, hilarious and sad. after watching it (even for the second time), the ending had me shaking and crying on my ride home...this movie makes you look at life in a completely different way, and teaches you not to take a moment of it for granted..."
2,"try ""american depressing""","this movie failed to live up to the hype for me. perhaps the title is ironic -- the movie wallows in depression, vapidity and numbness. i bet a lot of people have empty lives; it's not a lot of fun to watch for two hours nor did this movie bring me any new insights or empathy. spacey is unquestionably a great actor but i found him unappealing and occasionally bordering on repulsive."
3,Not even close,"This is not one of the best films ever made, it is not even in the top 100. Anyone who thinks so has either not seen or understood Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver, 2001 or The Battleship Potemkin. American Beauty is riddled with first year film school cliches and kindergarden philosophy. The angst filled teenagers are not only unappealing, they are nauseating to look at and listen to. Annette Benning give as adequate but unremarkable performance (she can cry and scream, so what?) What American Beauty does have is an absolutely brilliant performance by Kevin Spacey. Everything else in the film has been done before and better."
3,Alternative Mainstream,"This is not that new. It`s just an independent movie overhyped to the extreme. It`s not that challenging, either, since ""Fight Club"" did this kind of stuff much better, and earlier. Not to say it`s bad, since there are some good elements to find here. The direction by Sam Mendes was creative enough but not stellar. The acting was appropriate although some characters seemed like caricatures straight out of ""Daria"". The plot, a bit unbalanced and sometimes went over the top. Ok, it`s a dark comedy but that ending is neither dark nor comic and just doesn`t fit with the rest of the story. Despite this flaws, it still works as an observation of today`s american society (is it just about the american?) and is another worthwile indie view of the calm, monotonous suburbs."
3,a true story,Radio is a true story about this man in a small south Carolnian town This is a nice family movie that tells the importance of kindness in a person. The people learn that there are things more inportantes than being smart.Audience: 10 and olderMPAA Rating: PGProfanity: A few bad wordsNudity/Sex: NoneAlcohol/Drugs: NoneViolence: Some tense momentsRelease date: October 24 2004Starring: Cuba Gooding Jr. Ed Harris.Directed: Michael Tollin.1 hour 49 minutes.
5,THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE,"When my best friend asked me to see this movie in the theater, I must say that I was reluctant to see it. Needless to say, I returned to the theater 5 times to see it again. I cried every time. This film has truly touched my soul. And I can honestly say it has changed my life. It has a great story, and it is full of meaning, Kevin Spacey is incredible. When the movie recieved all the Oscars my eyes filled with tears. American Beauty is my all time favorite movie. I am the proud owner of the DVD and the screenplay! PLEASE see this movie!! It is out of this world."
2,American Beauty is only Skin Deep,"Every now and then you see a film you initially think of as ground-breaking, until you start to think about it. American Beauty is such a film. What most bothered me about this film was its message that those of us in suburbia are repressed hypocrites who secretly hate our lives. Perhaps most disturbing was its portrayal of Marine Colonel Frank Fitz as a pseudo-Nazi who abuses those around him--this is (yet another) thinly veiled slap by Hollywood at the military. When all is said and done, this movie really says nothing of substance about American society. If you want to see the best example of film as social commentary, I recommend ""Fight Club."
1,It Made For a Really Good Trailor..........,"This movie is really pretty bad. Nothing in this movie was groundbreaking in the least, and the fact that nearly everybody bought into it was just sad. The people in this movie are stereotypes through and through, which is a thing comedies are made of not dramas. Just think for a second of this movie played for laughs as opposed to the garbage seriousness that ended up on the screen."
2,Mid-Life Spiritual Awakening or Statutory Rape - You Decide!,"A confused film with stereotypes and a self-deceiving message that confounds statutory rape with a mid-life spiritual awakening. Check out the fantastic Aussie film from 1987, BLISS, (directed by Ray Lawrence) and you will see how AB is a weak, mixed-up reworking (from a writer who cut his teeth in TV sitcoms). The very last scene of AB is the true tip-off to the reality of the rip-off, compare the camera's heavenwards pullback and Spacey's final voiceover monologue. The lovely poetry of BLISS' last scene will, if you have even a vague pulse, bring real soul-tears to your eyes. You tell me.PS - I was moved at the final images of Annette Benning's wailing in the closet and her brief, gleeful smile on the Tilt-a-Whirl (black and white film is so underrated). So, there's a couple of stars for that."
3,interesting but is being a critic a real job? o.O,"I thought this movie was pretty good, made me think about life but once I finished it and looked at the raves from critics, kind of made me take a star away. the raves just made this movie overrated in MY BOOK. critics should keep their mouths shut and not make it their job to review movies. honestly, they just ruin stuff!"
2,Truly Disturbing Movie,"This movie definitely is disturbing for the soul and the mind. The look at how a dysfuntional ""all-American"" family can see the scares and the happiness of how everyday life can be for most families. I saw this movie out of the Oscar excitement. It made me a bit haunted. I still wonder why it won Best Picture?"
2,ick,"A thinking person's movie for the intellectually lazy. Shallow and derivative, with fairly good acting and nice perfume-commercial style visuals... Not to be taken seriously, but still fairly entertaining."
1,Save your money,"This has got to be the second worst movie I have EVER seen (there has to be a worse one; but I've erased it from memory). The story is about as disgusting as it gets. Talk about a strange collection of people!! I was absolutely horrified that this won awards; it's selection totally killed my respect for movie making. If you enjoy an entire movie about strange neighbors, a middle aged man that is obsessed with a cheerleader and spends his time masterbating and smoking pot, a neurotic wife, a really wierd daughter, and predictable plot (now who ever thought that the girl WASN'T a virgin)... Well, this is the movie for you!"
2,If you like well done dark movies and feeling worse than...,"...before you watch the film, this one's for you. As for me, my disappointment lies in expectations. I heard great things about the film and saw excerpts which led me to believe it would have many humorous moments. I wish advertisers would do more honest up front promoting of their films. Say something like ""well done, well acted, dark film about suburbia that will leave you feeling depressed"" so that if that is what you are in the mood for you can say, ""yep...this one's for me.""As for me, I wish I had not spent the money.I give the movie two stars only because it is well done...for that type of film. I just never care to see these types of films. Life's rough enough. Give me an average or better comedy or thriller any day."
3,"Original, but not worthy of an Academy Award","Grant it that this has been an original portrayel of modern day life and is deserving of some recognition, however I don't believe this is an award winning film. I do agree that the character development and depth of each character was interesting. Also, I was disappointed that the ""Awards Edition"" really didn't include any worthy bonus features."
5,great gift,"I bought this a while back as a shower gift, it is a great way to preserve those first moments, I recommend any new mom must have this or something similar, so we don't forget how tiny those precious little fingers and toes were. They grow so quick. :)"
5,*N SYNC has the best talent I have ever seen in my life!!!!!,"I think that *N Sync's Germany import has got to be one of the best cd's I have ever listened to.I love the unreleased tracks so much. I listen to this cd so much, I'm going to break it. I'm going to their July 24,1999 concert at Greatwoods in Massachussets for their summer tour. It's going to be so awesome.I paid so much for the tickets but it's worth it. I also got great seats too. I hope to meet them when I go.I don't have a favorite in the group but I think that Justin is so hot.He is the perfect guy(so aren't the guys in the group). I love his beautiful eyes and his curly hair and especially how he loves to stick out his tonge, It's so adorable!Everyone in the world should become an *N SYNC fan because they are so great! If everyone became an *N SYNC fan, the world would be a better place! STAY *N SYNC!!!!!!"
5,'N Sync has certainly got the flow!,"I am sooooo happy I got this cd of off amazon!It was a very smart choice!Any 'N Sync fan HAS to have this cd.If you don't have this cd,you are not a true 'N Sync fan!!Every song on this cd is 'ncredible!I LOVE 'N Sync!!:) I hope they always continue to bring their many fans 'ncredible music like they are doing right now!!I love them all but JC is truely my fave!He has the best voice!Thanks for putting out the best music ever,*N Sync!!"

Vote for NSync!Keep them at their home,#1!"
1,SORRY THEY SUCK..,IF THERE WAS A ZERO STAR I WOULD PUT IT..Guys who like them absolutely have problems .... these so called musicians are loved by these little 12 yr old girls who are in love with them....well sorry...THey Suuck....backstreet ..98 degrees nysnc..all the same CR*P
5,Justins Sweeti!,"Hey everyone whats up? I so so suggest you get this cd if you love Nsync you will LOVE this CD! yea alot of the songs are the same but I want you back An Tearun' up my heart are diffrent kinda, But It is awseom and they are the greatest group and NO ONE i mean NO ONE can beat them!!!!!I LOVE YOU JUSTIN!"
4,Nsync,This CD totally rocks...not the best but its awesome....the songs have a special beat to them like Tearin up My Heart doesn't sound like the US released one but it is just as good.And the ones that are unrelease in US are so cool especially Riddle.I am just hoping the new CD Celebrity is way better!!
4,Great CD,"I already had the American release of this CD, but when I heard them sing about 15 seconds of ""more than a feeling"" on MTV, I had to have the import. I love that song and it's just a great CD. Buy it, even if you have the american release. You will be pleasantly surprised"
5,*NSYNC IS THE BOMB!!!,"I really appreciate *NSYNC's music. It is something that you can listen to even when you're feeling down, and it will lift your spirits. i love the extra tracks and I think these guys deserve a lot of credit for their great music, and the inspirational lyrics. Stay *NSYNC"
5,This is one CRUNK album!,This is the best CD I've ever owned or listened to. 'N Sync is my favorite group and it's great to hear the songs that aren't on the US album! Every true fan should have this CD. I love you 'N Sync!
5,Better than the US one,"I recently got this CD from a friend in Japan but it had a different cover and has different tracks from the US which makes it more collectable So you should buy it!! It will make you a bigger fan than u already are cause it features songs like Riddle,Together Again,forever Young and many more unreleased US tracks and they are really nice! I've met them twiceEND"
5,a fan from the heart,i;ve been a fan of n sync since they were on the disney channel special and th emore i see them i love them more. they collaborate voices so well and show their fanz all the love. i can't say i'm THE biggest fan but i hope to be. Keep up the great work guyz and don't forget to alwayz be *N Sync w/ yourselves and god.
5,"GIVE THEM THEIR CREDIT, THEY WORK HARD FOR WHAT THEY DO","I just got this cd and its absolutely fabulous. Its got five extra tracks that the U.S one doesnt have. Riddle isnt one of my faves but its great to dance to, i love more than a feeling and they did a great job on together again and forever young. You also get longer versions of tearin' up my heart and i want you back. Its a must have if you're an nsync fan, it sets them apart from the bsb, they deserve more credit for this album, its touching, one of the best they have."
4,*NSYNC Has Got The Flow..........,"The editorial above is quite negative in nature, for trying to sell an album. It's like going to a fast food joint, and having you second guess your meal choice, after they'd shown you something less than pleasing.Being their first album it is decent for what it has to offer. The greatest tracks are those that focus on the group's vocal abilities. Unfortunately, this was often overlooked, as their singles full of energy over shadowed their feat. The release of ""For The Girl Who Had Everything,"" few knew was a single. Despite negativity, *NSYNC became a fan favorite. People have slowly realized the band's talents. In concert the members instilled their desires to sing five part harmony, and well."
5,*NSYNC is the hottest Boy Band Ever!,"*Nsync is terain' up the charts and tearin' up our hearts! Ever since I saw this group perform on the Disney channel last year I fell in love, especially with the groups youngest, Justin Timberlake. I hav been to two of their concerts, bought their video and thier two cd's. Their self title CD is fab! If you don't own it, DO! You'll definitly fall in love with *NSYNC the moment you hear them and see them!"
3,This is an awesome CD.,"I think that this is an awesome CD and is sung by a group that is very cool. I'm a big fan of N'Sync, and I got hooked by watching them on Disney's N'Sync in concert."
1,NOT RODIN,This sculpture is NOT an exact replica of Rodin's Thinker and should not be advertised as such. It is only similar. The face and posture are quite different from the original.
5,Great detail on artwork and perfect size for office desk,I would recommend everyone who appreciates art to have his or her own copy of the Thinker! The carving detail is exquisite and this statue looks very expensive.
5,THE CD KIKS,"I love this cd. My favorite song is jah. This is the best punk/ska band out there. This band has excitment, and thrill packed in one. If you like nofx, then you should really get this cd. ThIs Cd Is ThE BeSt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,no good! get destruction!,this cd is really bad compared to destruction. someone is an ok song and probably the best on the cd. the rest is real bad. short 1 min songs with no melody and then slow ska loops. this cd is no good!!!! i would only listen to someone and independence parade. JUST GET DESTRUCTION!
3,Punk+Ska aren't always a good combonation,"Don't get me wrong, I mean I like this cd and all. In fact, it's probably one of my favorite Suicide Machines cd. But, I just don't think ""ska-punk"" is a good combo. Maybe it's just my opinion...Burn it from a friend or borrow/steal it or something. It's not really worth the money."
4,Battle Hymns blows to the competition out of the water...,When I first listened to Battle Hymns I wasn't sure if I was even listening to the same band that was on Destruction by Definition. The Suicide Machines had thrown that ska-core stuff from their last CD out the window and became a hardcore band. Battle Hymns is filled with such energy and aggression that the music seems to jump from the stereo and slap in the face. The Machines take on a lot of political issues as well as relationship problems and their is still some ska thrown in the mix. Buy this CD NOW!
5,TROP PUISSANT,"Battle hymns , yé trop puissant, du bon ska mélanger avec du hardcore....pis le chanteur avec sa voix écoeurante...encore meilleur que destruction by definition, Battle hymns te fait capoter!!!! un achat sur!!! JAH!"
3,Not at all what you'd expect...,"The trailers for this movie suggest one type of movie, and the movie itself is actually a much tamer version of that. All the exciting moments are put into that trailer. Trust me; there are no more scary parts. What's left is a mystery for the wife to solve. A good story, but misleading trailers. It's simplistic and old-fashioned- not my favorite type, but I'd recommend the movie itself because it was good quality."
4,"Slow, but an overall great movie!!","The director thought he might kill some time and add more suspense to a mountain of suspense already by suggesting that Pfeiffer's character watch and monitor her neighbors activity. Personally, all that was a waste of time and did not add anymore credibility to the movie itself. The idea: man cheats on wife, wife had accident, wife develops amnesia as result of accident, wife and hubby move to different location, wife is getting strange feelings in her new house, wife puts 2+2 together, hubby is a lying SOB, you get the picture. A great movie that shouldnot be missed!!"
2,"Slow, predictable, and over-acted","I am usually a big fan of both Robert Zemeckis and Harrison Ford so I was really looking forward to seeing this film, especially considering all the praise it received at the box office. But when I finally watched this one, I was very disappointed. The pace of the movie is painfully slow, until the ending, and by then I was tired of the movie. The plot twists are very predictable. And the digital effects used in the film look awkward and don't add anything to the film (except to the budget). The Hitchcock style that Zemeckis uses at the end of the film is almost too obvious and is not very effective. As far as Harrison Ford goes, he does a good job with his character. But Michelle Pfeiffer does some terrible over-acting as Ford's unstable wife. All-in-all, this movie was a big let-down. Worth a rental, but don't waste your money buying this one."
4,SLOW MOVING THRILLER,".....""Does for bathtubs what Psycho did for showers"" ...that was the promo for this picture ...to compare this picture to Psycho is borderline sacrilege ........Ford and Pfeiffer turn in good workmen-like performance but the flaw in this movie is in its slow moving plodding direction. It is mysterious and spooky but spine tingling edge-of-the-seat suspenseful it is not......Until the final scenes where Ford is exposed as a killer with a murder in his past does the movie exhibit any real tension but it takes a long time getting there and if you haven't fallen asleep by then you might enjoy this over hyped movie......Fans with a foot fetish might enjoy the copious shots of Pfeiffer's bare feet."
2,Red Herring'sville,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It started out suspenseful enough, but then it couldn't decide what it wanted to be, a ghost movie, a murder mystery, whatever... It was very predictable and the attempted murder scene in the bathtub, rather than being suspenseful ended up being long and tedious (no ""Psycho"" shower scene). Then the old cliche of having the murderer revive after you think he's a goner... Don't villains who get conked out ever stay put ! Then the scene in the lake where the murderer tries to get rid of the Michelle in the sunken car ! It was all in the dark, and I only found out who survived (another cliche, as if the murderer gets away !...) when Michelle Pfeiffer visits the tomb of the other missing girl, so we know that she escaped from the doomed car. How she escaped - that's the mystery for me !"
1,CRAP,"With this movie, Harrison Ford completes his trilogy of amazingly bad movies: ""SEVEN DAYS, SIX NIGHTS "", "" RANDOM HEARTS"" and now this ""thing"" with Michele Pfeiffer. THis movie is so dumb, with all the cliches: the villain that's supposed to be dead after hitting his head but it's not; the underwater car at night where it seems like daylight, so clear it is underwater !! THe ""suspense"" where everyone knows right from the start who is the bad guy; Ford giving another lesson in bad acting...Well, it seems to me, reading the reviews below, that I'm wrong in my point of view. So, enjoy this garbage."
3,"Disappointment, but still enjoyable.","When I went into the cinema to see this film, I expected it to be excellent. It was at the top of the charts at the time, so I figured it couldn't be too bad. But unfortunately, this film turned out to be a pretty big disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, all I'm saying is that I really don't think it should have gotten a cinema release. Anyway, the main problem that I had with this film was that it didn't really have enough to it. The plot was too simple, and there wasn't enough events in the film. Oh, but then again, the ending was kind of a surprise.Well, see this film if you want, but don't expect too much."
1,Are we supposed to take this seriously?,"Seriously, this movie has Michelle...I don't care that much to finish her last name. She is a terrible actress and yet she keeps getting roles in good movies. This isn't one of them. Unlike her catwoman preformance in ""Batman Returns"" where she was at least nice to look at, she does nothing in this movie. It's not even up to par with ""Dangerous Laisons,"" in which where suppsoed to believe the hottest women in france are Glenn Close (ok, technically she is an attractive older woman) and Michelle. If that's true, I'm never going to france.This movie, and the plot could have been covered in a seven minute short film...and how did they get Harrison Ford to do this?All in all this movie sucks and time should not be wasted watching it."
4,Haunting,"This movie was very haunting and told through a minimal amount of characters and superb acting. One character slowly finds the strength to face the truth, while the other has the past come back to haunt him and avenge his misdeeds!Very well done!"
2,This movie is pure JUNK,"Save your money. I usually like Harrison Ford, but this movie is SORRY. For a surprise ending to be successful, you should be able to look back through the movie and recognize that the clues were there. The clues in this one are deliberately misleading, and make no sense when you look back. The big finale is a joke - the effects people must have been asleep. Pathetic."
3,"Great cast, not so good movie","I was truly disappointed in this film. As many have attested to in their reviews of this movie the cast Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford were tremendous and continue to show why they are great actors. For the most part the story was strong and had the potential to be a blockbuster movie. But the actual telling of the story was lame at best, but I was most disappointed in the ending. Rather than leave the audience saying ""Wow, that ended differently than I expected"" and talking about the ending for a long time comming. The director chose to take the ""safe"" happy ending.As much as I wanted to love this movie, and as much as Michelle and Harrison did a tremendous job acting. The telling of the story could not be saved. I give it three stars because of the actors and I respect them for giving it their all."
3,Thriller,"This was a good movie. It wasn't totally what I expected, but it was a good movie. Its definitely a thriller/horror movie, and you really cant just sit back and relax to watch it. There is a lot of suspense in this movie, but it tends to get a little bloody. If youre into horror movies, but dont want something as horrifying as Scream or Friday the 13th, then this is a good movie for you."
4,I love that box!!!,"I need help! I love the keepsake box that belonged to Madison, and I am needing information as to where I can purchase one. Is the store in the movie (where the box was bought) a ""REAL"" store?? Any info is appreciated. THANKS..."
3,There is a ghost in her house,"It is rats in the attic or termites in the timbers ( bats in the bell freeor bugs in your hat?), but never, never real spirits? Seeing the head doctorand fighting off the men in white coats, people believe in their lonesome fantasy of dead people walking? Is it the neighbor's dead wife or something more sinister? It seems to be a plum role for Michelle Pfeiffer?Harrison Ford is kind of the straight man to the bent housewifewith delusions that aren't...MEF and possession.From there things go from bad to worse.Well made, well acted, just not the kind of movie I like.I've watched it twice to make this review."
1,What lies beneath? Utter Boredom,"Come on! a ""non-stop thrill ride"" maybe if you are a member of an undiscovered tribe deep in the jungle... or maybe if you have been dead for a hundred years and have never seen a ""talkie"" before. This movie, apart from being derivative and MIND NUMBINGLY BORING, is so predictable that it had us going ""... and his eyes open!"", ""... and he's in the back of the truck!"", ""... and it's only the dog!"" about a minute and a half before the lame, predictable, cheap, non-thrill occurred on-screen. There were virtually NO special effects, which can at least make a big waste-of-time movie watchable. And, I will admit I am usually a complete dullard when it comes to guessing the ""twist"" in movies (i.e. had no clue about Sixth Sense) but I had this stinker figured out in about 15 minutes. Save your money, and remember Time is something one can never get back."
2,You're All Mad,"Classic thriller? Hitch would have enjoyed it? Oh My God are you people out of touch. This was a slow, dull, verbose, convoluted, trashy, wannabe adult thriller with a bit of style, no substance, pregnant pauses of triplet proportions and a few moments that make you jump out of your seat. What is most annoying about this film is that the first forty minutes, in which we are shown the next-door neighbours as red herrings. This would be acceptable if their strange circumstances were later explained. This large portion of the film is totally unnecessary, boring and there for seemingly unknown reasons. What is further frustrating is the ending does not belong in the same movie as the rest. After a good bathroom scene we are treated (?) to a series of calamities where good, well-respected actors are placed in a very bad scream-clone. All in all a flat out disappointment, and one better left off your dvd shelf. What Lies Beneath??? Not very much!!!"
2,pointless in every way,"What's the point of taking a substandard ghost script and making a whole movie out of it, especially when practically identical forms of entertainment and media just like it come out every week? Oh silly me, to make money of course. And how could they lose with Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer. Ah well..."
2,alright,"This movie started out good and had me going until the middle of the movie. The rest of the move was dissapointing. I did not buy harrison ford being an evil character and he did not pull it off very well. Over all I think it was worth watching, but not worth buying. It had all the attraction of a made for tv movie."
2,This One Should Have Stayed Beneath,"I cannot begin to describe my disappointment with this film! What potential it HAD!!! And then - the END came - what a joke of an ending. Good twists and turns throughout, but a thoroughly IGNORANT ending (don't worry I won't give it away for those of you determined to see ignorance at work)!! Kudos to both Pfeifer and Ford (though he's no where near as good as Michelle in this suspense flic)! The DVD is pretty solid too, with features and such. In Conclusion - a decent rental, when you've run out of other choices, but NOT one to add to the dvd/video collection."
2,B movie rehash,"I note that the review above thinks this was a pretty good movie. I thought it was awful. the whole movie is dark,like those cheap movies where you can't see anything because the budget was too low to pay for special effects, and they substitute obscurity. There is also the cheap silence-followed-by-loud-noise effect, which is irritating, and had me fiddling constantly with the volume. What are these actors doing in the plotless rehash of other movies?"
2,What Lies Beneath is,your disappointment. The story is quite predictable and lame. DTS sound is nice. That's why 2 stars.
2,Drawn out and obvious,If Michelle didn't look so good I would have probably walked out. All the waiting for that lousy ending.Please
1,One of the Worst Endings Ever,From the beginning of the movie it is great. I believe that It builds suspense and it keeps my attention. But as it goes on it starts to drag. The ending is just terrible. It is so unblievable. What are the odds that they would fall into the lake in which the girl was killed. What are the odds that the murdered girl would come back to life and hold Harrison Ford down so he will drowned. And why would Michelle Pfeiffer chase after the identity of the missing girl. Harrison Ford acted terrible in the movie. Clearly one of his worst performances of all time. This movie could possible be a good movie to rent if you like good begginings but terrible endings. But it is not good enough to buy. It does not hit in my top 100 charts.
2,A good sleeping aid.,"The movie moves very slow at the beginning (and by ""beginning"", I mean the first 3/4 of the film) and doesn't have much happening plot-wise. Some ""surprise"" plot twists along the way keep you interested, only to let you down again. They just kind of leave you hanging. There was absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors.I did give it 2 stars because it picks up pace at the end (action-wise, but not plot-wise) and makes you glued to the screen, wondering what's going to happen next. Its just regrettable that the rest of the movie couldn't have been the same.At best, a renter."
1,BIG BUDGET = NOT SCARY,"I rarely review films on this site, but I just have to say that this is not only one of the worst attempts at a scary movie but also one of the worst movies ever made. The only way Hollywood could make a scary movie is if they filmed the private lives of it's stars. ""What Lies Beneath"" is nothing but a boring and pathetic shoplifter of far better movies. Try the 70s classic ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" or ""Ghost Story""...the original films that this ... stole from instead. ..., an episode of ""American Idol"" is far scarier. By the way, what HAPPENED to Harrison Ford??"
3,"A good Horror Movie leaves you mystified, not confused.","First of all-the acting was fantastic, I am no long time fan of harrison ford, but he lived up to his reputation in this movie. The story line was obviously well thought out and also well written, though a bit twisty at times and needed further explaination. Scary as this movie was, the actual ""villian"" in the movie, (the young girl haunting Michelle pfeiffer) is not scary enough herself. Often a ghost, monster, spirt, devil, or whatever evil character in the movie is, makes you terrifyed of them in general. What lies beneath did not accomplish this."
4,"Chilling, creepy and kinda long","What Lies Beneath is a very good film. Its' style is very similar to Hitchcock.While it is a long film that could have been shorter, that is the only drawback to this movie. While I don't necessarily care for the actor's, I thought the pacing, camera work, and script were excellent. There are many creepy parts to this movie, each one building up from the last one, until it all comes together in the climax.It's worth your time if you like suspenseful, well thought out movies."
3,Paralysis?,"Yes, it did make me scream, but my threshold for fear is very low.I wanted to slap the Pfeiffer character as she had the luxury of staying at home and not working, and used this time to do nothing of use, having switched her brain off long before.She then focused on her neuroses, which had convenient memory lapses to support them.But the bits that bugged me because they were simply wrong concerned the use of the anaesthetic agent. She lay on the floor paralysed, unable to move any muscle ... but what's that ... she's still breathing! What a wonderful drug! We must introduce it to hospitals as it will make operations safer. Muscle paralysis that is selective so that we don't need to ventilate. Spontaneous breathing with every other muscle paralysed. Chuck out the old drugs that would have stopped breathing too."
2,BAD MOVIE - BAD!,"Ok, for anyone that has seen really good suspense films that reach out grab you and pull you in to the movie in such a way that you would rather pee in your pants instead of hitting pause.THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!!!!!This movie was bad for the first half, then kinda kewl - then totally predictable!! - Rent B4 U buy"
2,Half a good film,"I enjoyed the first part of this movie, which featured a creepy setup. Unfortunately, the lame story kicked in and I lost interest. I won't go into some of the plot points, but you could drive a truck convoy through them. The DVD picture didn't even look as good the second hour as it did the first, probably because of more night shots. I did like the sound though. That was the only aspect of the film that stayed solid throughout the long two-plus hours. If you want a film like this, stick to ""The Sixth Sense."""
3,Not spooky if that's your flavor!!,"I thought that the plot of this movie was okay. The movie was entertaining. However, I got a little weary of the suspenseful music used to make the movie scary. This is not a scary movie if that is what some people are looking for. It is entertaining if being entertained is enough. Michelle Pfeiffer annoyed me with that constant silly expression she used to looked spooked! She always had her mouth opened. I think that she was not directed well in her performance. This movie was quite a change in character for Harrison Ford ( who is one of my favorite actors). Not his best performance, but acceptable. All in all, I liked the movie."
3,"For Me, A Good Moovy Was Marred.....","....by the obvious animation of the shock ending. This is a thriller, not a comic piece like Scooby Doo or Ghostbusters. A little more work could have been done there. Pfieffer, Ford and the suspense makers in this one did an outstanding job getting the most mileage and mystery from the story, but, I dunno--I expected more than the cartoonish ending. Especially after Zemeckis and his storymakers did so great on ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Death Becomes Her""."
3,Soooooooooooooo scary,"Ok,first thing I want to ask is,why isn't this movie an 18?In comparison to movies that are eg.the scream trilogy it is one of the scariest films I've eva seen!!!I could have coped with most of it,but about 30 mins from the end when Pfeiffer's paralysed in the bath,Ford pulls her forward to give her a hug,she flips her head back and..........I don't want to give it away,but let's just say I switched the film off there and then and refused to watch anymore of it.This film could be really good,but its not for those who scare easily.Only watch this if ur seriously not scared by ANYTHING!!!I watched it months ago and I still cam't relax in the bath."
3,I could have don with out the last 10 minutes.,"As usual, Hollywood is not very good at endings. I was liking this film a lot until I saw the last 10 minutes when they go in the water and bla, bla, bla.I mean, the way Harrison Ford refused to die reminded me of Freddy Krueger or Jason.Too bad because it was up to that point, a very good movie."
3,Strange and Morbid,"This movie was definitely strange. I sometimes like murder mysteries and this was the first time I've seen one that wasn't a cheesy teen flick. Before I blew six dollars on a ticket to see it, I had heard pretty good things about it. My advice to one who wishes to see this movie: Don't rely on another's review of this movie. Personally, I don't like it."
3,Watch your blood pressure,"I saw this movie on DVD last night, and I must admit I watched the clock a few times during the 2 hour thriller. It was slow moving and slow to develop. On the contrary however, I was in suspense for a good 45 minutes of this movie. Even when you know something is going to fall, or show up behind Michelle you can't help from skipping a heart beat. Definitely a renter not a buyer."
3,a good thriler,"Well, I usually love Robert Zemeckis as a director. I loved all the Hitchkokian touches in this film. The acting by Pfeiffer is just about perfect. She creates a memorable of perfromance of a woman's mounting hysteria and fear as she learns more about her self, her marriage and the truth about her life and a certain missing girl! That's all fine an dandy. The problem with the film is it's predictablity. Harrison Ford is credible when he is playing chracters who suffer and take action to fix theor problems. Here, he is reduced to stoic mumbling. He walks through the film as if he is saying ohhh I get 20 million to act, so why not just atke it easy. Wrong choice just about his worst perfromance. But, the film has excelent cinamaoagrphy, atomosphere and the wonder ful Diana Scarwid who proves that 20 years after Mommy Dearest we can all become great"
4,"Shocking, yet very entertaining!!","""What Lies Beneath"" is a scarefest that will have you on the edge of your seat. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer gave great performances as Norman and Claire, the perfect couple leading the ""perfect"" life, until these ghostly apparitions start appearing in the house, etc. This film will send chills tingling down your back until the end. And also, you will never believe who the killer is in this movie!! But I will not say who he/she is until someone has rented or bought this movie. The extras for the DVD were exceptional. The pretty decent extra was the trailer for the film. But anyways, dont miss this film!!!"
5,"Outstanding, underrated thriller!","What Lies Beneath is a highly entertaning film, full of great moments, from the always fantastic Robert Zemeckis. Great performances from the entire cast, but Michelle Pfeiffer owns the film with an outstanding performance. Involving story-telling, patient pacing, and great GOTCHA! moments. Keeps you engrossed like a great novel as you watch the story unfold. One of the films biggest assets is it's creepy and eerie atmosphere, perfect setting. Works it's magic best in late-night viewings with the lights out! Have fun with this one!"
4,"""She's starting to suspect something...""","What Lies Beneath starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer is a Hitchcock style film. I like this movie, Pfeiffer steals every scene while Ford plays his creepiest role yet. What Lies Beneath is about a husband and wife who are now in the empty nest period of their lives, the daughter has moved onto college and the couple have buried a secret and finally starts resurface. This film is a bit slow especially the first hour but after that the pace and story fall into place. Give this sly and slick ghost film a chance. Enjoy!"
4,Great low key thriller,"Hitchcock comparisons aside, this is one tidy ghost story.Minimal gore and violence, some self-depracating humor, and losts of creepy, eerie moments make this one a winner. Atmosphere is key here and the stunning lake house they built for this film is gorgeous. Tranquil, beautiful. peaceful and just the right set-up to concince us it's all paranoia.Pfeiffer is absolutely excellent here and carries the film squarely on her shoulders. If we don't believe her, the whole film goes out the window. Her performance ranks among her best and she did deserve an Oscar nod for it. Her expression change when she is momentarily ""possessed"" and the sees the house door open reflected in a mirror is alone worth a viewing of this quasi old fashioned chiller.A good fun ride, some nice chills, and Pfeiffer's perfomance make this the winner it is,"
1,........boo.,"THIS is what passes for a horror movie in this day and age!???!!To quote the great Homer J. Simpson, this movie is more boring than church. How can anyone consider this movie even REMOTELY scary or suspenseful? Aside from a few surprises (which are all shown on the trailer, by the way), this movie is pretty much dialogue, scared looks, and a lousy plot filled with more holes than swiss cheese. It is also very long...it moves in a way that you keep thinking it's gonna end, and BAM! Something else comes up, and we have to wait fifteen minutes for that to get solved. If you want a real horror movie, I recommend anything from my list, ""The Best Scary Movies Out There!"". But pass this one up. Really."
1,waste,"What a waste of two excellent acting talents! This movie is dull, dull, dull. A potentially good plot was flubbed."
2,Pastiche,"Another wanna-be Hitchock film. First-off, if you've seen the trailer for this movie, there's no point in watching it because it's given everything away. Second, there's no suspense in the silly plot. Third, it's predictable who the bad-guy is and it makes nonsense out of the entire film. Not to mention that the ending is rediculous."
1,What absolute drivel,"If Harrison Ford had acted this badly in Blade Runner or Star Wars, he would never have got anywhere in his career! Come on HF, we expected better than this from you. Give us something worth watching next time."
1,What Lies Beneath? Absolutely nothing.,"Perhaps director/writer Robert Zemeckis should have stuck with comedies like ""Back to the Future"". This attempt at a thriller is dismal, becoming increasingly scattered until the story finally peters out into complete boredom. It seems like Zemeckis would have said to himself at one point ""Hey, what th' Hell is going on here?"" That's what I was saying after about 45 minutes. Plot lines are developed and then disappear. Coincidences and revelations are totally unbelievable. And the ""surprise"" ending? Preposterous. The stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer (who are both starting to look a little dowdy, by the way) give blah performances. For anyone who has never seen a classic Hitchcock (and there are a lot of el-cheapo touches here) this ""thriller"" might be acceptable. For others ... caveat emptor!"
3,What Lies Beneath,"`What Lies Beneath' is a pretty good thriller movie starring both Michelle Pfieffer and Harrison Ford. Following a couple who have recently moved into their summer house permanently this film follows Claire (Pfieffers character) as she starts to notice unusual events around the home that start to get more mysterious and supernatural. The tension quickly ratchets up until you are ready to jump at any little thing and then the finale starts to unravel with a good twist in the tale and a pretty good ending. This film offers lots of jumps and tension, it has some excellent acting from all involved and is shot very well. I found the ending a little cliché and meagre payoff for all the tension it initially created, but as far as mainstream thriller/horror films go, this isn't that bad. Worth a look.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,nice plot with a cool twist,"this movie is worth seeing if only for the fact that Harrison Ford does NOT play a boyscout. i'm a fan of his but he played in like six straight movies where he was cast as bad-thing-happens-to-good-guy character.anyway, the pace is a bit slow at first but picks up halfway through. as you'd expect for a thriller. Harrison was a bad boy, but his wife (michelle feifer) doesn't know until strange spirits in their house begin to contact her...mild thumbs up."
5,Flawless!,"There are no bad points to this film. Great actors, unique storyline, and a really good plot all add up to a film that cannot be missed. Other than being a tad long when you watch it a second time, this movie is flawless. The special effects were smooth and beautifully eerie. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this film or to recommend it to a friend."
2,Miscast and derivative. And feet.,"I seriously wonder if the reviewers here who declare this film ""Hitchcockian"" have ever actually seen an Alfred Hitchcock film. It's a rather mediocre ATTEMPT at Alfred Hitchcock-style filmmaking, maybe, but nothing more.That said, there's nothing here you haven't seen in a second-rate ""Tales from the Crypt"" episode. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, fine actors though they are, do NOT belong in these roles, and their prescence is distracting and slightly uncomfortable. On the other hand, if you're a foot fetishist, buy this movie at any price! What this movie lacks in scares and originality, it makes up for with interest in close-ups of Michelle Pfeiffer's bare feet. *sigh* Next movie, Mr. Zemeckis?"
5,What Lies Beneath,I thought the film was terrific the effects where out of this world and i the bath and river scenes where great you had me going when you made everybody think the that the bloke next door had murdered his wife but Harrisons Fords chracter actually killed one of his students and she was the ghost everybody saw. It made me jump a few times and i would like to know if you are thinking of making a second one.
5,I can&#65533;t hold my breath long,"What Lies Beneath"" is the best film of the summer.This movie Zemeckis has produced a thriller This mystery from director Robert Zemeckis casts Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as a quiet couple living in the hills of Vermont. However, when they begin seeing visions of a woman who is haunting their house the husband confesses that it is the ghost of a young girl with whom he had an affair and who might have been murdered. suspenseful film WHAT LIES BENEATH will keep viewers on the edge of their seats don`t miss this movie"
2,Surprisingly conventional thriller - - still entertaining.,"The movie starts out fairly ""realistically"" employing simply camera techniques and ends up being a silly exercise in the cheap use of computer ghost imagery.I was surprised to find out that this film was directed by Zemeckis. Considering how well crafted and inventive his other films such as Forrest Gump and Castaway were, this film resorts to corny special effects and hackneyed suspense techniques. This film has been compared to Hitchcocks films. The difference however is that Hitchcock will employ brilliant camera techniques and timing and music -- NOT cop-out techniques of artificial CGI to paste in ghost images.Furthermore Harrison Ford's character development is simply inconsistent and rather unbelievable. This is a well done ""made-for-tv"" movie."
2,"""What Lies Beneath"" Lacks","What do you get with a Hitchcock film? A strange experience with the usual female lead that the story is based around. What do you get when you try to make a Hitchcock film? This. ""What Lies Beneath"" is a good idea that kills itself when it doesn't move the story along in a scary movie pace. It tires so hard to throw you off -too hard- ending up more predictable, and even boring. Everyone did well for the inept script and lack of focus it had. But for such a silly script, why did big stars like Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer sign on?"
4,Terror Lies Beneath!,"What lies Beneath is a great movie. From the setting to the acting, it's all just wonderful. Two lovers, Michelle ?Pfeiffer? and Harrison Ford are living in a house near an ocean and weird things start happening to Michelle. The door shuts on her, she sees a reflection of someone in the bathtub, and the mirror writes a word by itself. There are many jumpy scenes leading to the conclusion. I did already know the conclusion half way through the movie; it was kind of easy to guess, but still, it is done terribly creepy and awesome. Lots of Oh My Gosh! scenes in the end which leave you thinking; that's all I'll say, don't want to spoil it for you! Yes, I'd definitely recommend this to everyone. Whether you like this or that, this is a good movie for most people. Just remember, as I said before, don't be eating popcorn - all the ""jumping out"" scenes will make the popcorn FLY!-Alex S."
4,Fabulous First Half,"Norman and Clare Spencer have just moved into a beautiful old house in Vermont and sent their daughter off to college. Clare is looking forward to doing some of teh things she hasn't had time for-gardening and finishing fixing up their home. However, an unwelcome visitor to her home begins to foil her plans.The first half of What Lies beneath was wonderful, very spooky and captivating. The visual beauty of the Vertmont landscape was also quite well done. However, the second half of the movie became a bit repetitive, as I felt the viewer could foresee exactly what was going to happen. The movie saves its four stars, however, by the unique ending.What Lies Beneath is definately recommended for all fans of thrillers!"
4,Could have been better.,"As a 21 year fan & collector of Harrison Ford I used to be first in the door opening day for his movies. That stopped with Random Hearts. I did not for this one either. I am glad it was a hit for him, but he deserves better material. Good extras & picture quality on the disc though."
4,A Real Thriller,"This movie is full of suspense and the acting is wonderful. I would give it a 4.5 if that were possible. The only negative thing I can say is that in the ending the suspense was ""overkill""--it just went on and on and on. It could have been cut a few scenes before and have been a perfect movie. With such a strong development, less would have been more."
5,"""I Think She's Starting To Suspect Something."" ""Who?"" ""Your Wife.""","Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.This intriguing homage to The Master Of Suspense, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, goes slightly beyond what you would expect from an homage to the greatest director of suspense thrillers ever. From the opening credits until the DreamWorks logo appears at the end, you are hooked. There are plenty of twists and turns that will make you jump, and the revelation of the real killer is a real shocker...The score is very reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann, who scored several of The Master's greatest films (Psycho comes to mind listening to the music at the beginning of the end credits). Terrific homage to the director & composer of some of the greatest suspense films ever made.Rated PG-13 (scary moments/images, some violence, a brief sensual scene and mild-to-brief strong language)."
5,Love it!,"I love this movie and the quality is good. I wish they had a blue-Ray version, but this will have to do."
5,What Lies Beneath,I had no issues with this seller or with the product itself. This is one of three scary movies that I own and I always enjoy it. The item arrived as it was described to me by the seller and within the allotted time frame for delivery stated when ordered.
4,I found it entertaining,"Okay not so original, okay some mess ups in it. Overall, very good and kept my interest. I thought Harrison Ford did a great job in an unfamiliar role for him. Michelle Pfieffer was good. I think it's worth watching. If nothing else for a few laughs."
2,How should I put this? This movie... is... Funky. Yah.,"What Lies Beneath is definately... Interesting. But... It doesn't make all that much sense. (Anyone care to tell me how he got in the back of that truck? When he was, like DYING in the house? Yah. That was odd.) Scary, sure, but only in the moment. (If you think about it later the only thing taht scared you was how they'd do a loud noise and zoom in on something.) It's not the best movie, in my opinion... But whatever. If u haven't seen it yet, I'd rent it to see if you like it first. And find someone to grab onto for when they zoom in on... stuff.~Film Reader the Sequel"
5,Excellent!,"I just watched this movie tonight and man, what an excellent movie. You always get lead one way and then you get taken another way until your not really sure what is going on. As the mystery continues to unfold to the very shocking truth, my wife and I had chills running up and down our spines. This was just the kind of movie for one who likes to be spooked. Cool special effects and Ford and Phieffer are excellent."
2,TOO LONG ... AND TOO MANY ENDINGS!,"Even if one is a clever craftsman of cinema, he have to work on good ideas to make a good movie. This time the ideas are not enough, and it's impossible to create a very good product making use above all of unexpected apparitions and violent underlines of the soundtrack.The quotations of Hitchcock are banal, and it's always unpleasant when people speaks too much about the citations instead the ideas of a movie.The movie is too long and falls back on the hackneyed stratagem of a finale that never ends, because the villain doesn't want to die!The most pleasing thing is the acting of Michelle Pfeiffer, always abler when her character is vulnerable and disturbed, and time by time always more beautiful."
2,Ho Hum,"A boring movie containing nothing which hasn't been done before and more capably. The story moves at a snails pace, the ""scares"" are about on a Scooby-Doo level and the action is almost non-existent. On the commentary-early on, the movie is compared to Hitchcock--what chutzpah! Harrison Ford has some secrets and Michelle Pfieffer has the usual suspicions coupled with paranoia-not to spoil the ""mystery""-but the plot becomes clear about an hour before the movie reaches it's uneventful conclusion. Harrison Ford plays a different role than most of us are accustomed to-but the movie is still poor. Rent it if you must--but I wouldn't recommend buying it. This is the most boring movie I've sat through since ""Magnolia"""
3,7th grader needs more info.,I read this book for my English class. I started the book because I am interested in knowing the history of Levi's. The book spent too much time on his religious life and past and too little time on the development of the greatest line of clothing ever.
3,Review: Principles of Biblical Hermeneutics,"I'm glad I bought this book. It had good information and its format made it easy to digest (outlines) without a lot of effort. With that said, I agree with other reviews I had read before purchasing that it appears the author does not apply his own methods. A number of analysis and applications in the text did not appear to follow good practices and therefore generated concerns about the validity of the author's conclusions.With that said, I believe in the sincerity of the author. However, I would more strongly recommend Henry Virkler and Karelynne Ayayo's text on Hermenuetics. It is a more scholarly work in my opinion and much more consistent in it's application."
4,A Beautifully Organized Reference Book,"While one or two statements in the book concerning Israel are dated (this book copywrited in 1947), I have found this is a book I return to over and over because it is organized and categorized so well; makes a great study guide. While I have not read it cover to cover completely, a scan of each of the sections show the majority of the data is supported by scriptural references, but a surprising amount is not. It is written from the Classical Dispensationalist viewpoint. Well worth the price for anyone serious about collecting reference books."
5,Principles of Biblical Hermeneutics,I bought this book for someone else for their study purposes and they seem to appreciate it very much without complaint.
5,Excellent Read,"This book has exceeded my expectation, I have been looking for a book like this for a long time. My friend introduced this one to me and I am glad that he did."
5,The best yet,I love my new study help. I received in excellent condition and now my friends are envious of me. I know that I will have many years of resource with this book. Thanks
3,Christina Dodd Has Written Much Better,"Christina Dodd is my one of my favorite authors. She has a talent for making her characters come alive and capture the reader. But she didn't use the talent in this book. The heroine,Marian,was so exasperating I was clenching my teeth. She was described as someone who was independent and could take care of herself, but she did the stupidest things that got her into trouble and then she needed to be rescued. So much for being able to take care of herself. This was not Christina Dodd's usual writing style. Her heroines are usually pragmatic, strong women who can handle problems on their own. My personal favorites are Castles In The Air, Treasure of The Sun, and Once A Knight."
2,Not much to like in this romance,"The most fundamental problem with this book has been touched on by the other reviewers. Basically, it's really difficult to like Marian, the heroine. She does lots of stupid things. She's not helped by the author who only reveals her motivation at the end of the book, long after I'd ceased to care about Marian.Griffith isn't much better. I've been reading romances for decades and remember the bodice rippers with fondness. Still, he treads an awfully fine line between seduction and rape.Finally, as a big fan of Josephine Tey's ""The Daughter of Time"", I was really annoyed with the blind following of Dodd in her treatment of Richard III. Tey's book very convincingly states that Richard's reputation is not deserved and that the propaganda that created the reputation didn't start until many years after this book was written."
3,Not bad for what it is supposed to be,"This wasn't too bad, for a historical romance. It's set at the beginning of the reign of Henry VII, the father of the notorious Henry VIII, though none of it actually takes place at court. However, Henry VII does play a large role. Political intrigue is the driving force behind most of the plot. The romance between Marian and Griffith could have been a little more developed -- they went from lust to love very quickly -- but there were things I enjoyed. The dialogue, though not completely historically accurate, is more fitting than the speech patterns of today that are often used in historical romances. Also, I like the twisting intrigue of court. I'm liking Christina Dodd, and I'll definitely be reading more of her books."
3,Hmmm,"In OUTRAGEOUS, Marian is protecting 'her son' as well as a massive secret. Griffith is sent to deliver a message to her but finds himself unwilling to leave. When a new king is crowned, Griffith and Marian have to pledge their fealty, but will it leave them on opposite sides of the monarchy?This is the first book I've read by this author and I'm not sure what my thoughts are concerning her work. I found the beginning of the book confusing and difficult to become part of. The characters were a bit stiff, but this could be due to the author's attempt at authenticity. The story is set in the 1400s, after all. Everytime I thought I would stop reading, Ms Dodd managed to bring in something that grabbed my attention. For this reason, I will give this author another try.I'm aware that Ms Dodd writes historical as well as contemporary. Although I will try another of her historicals, I will also read one of her contemporary works.My overall thoughts...undecided, but willing to try again.[...]"
3,Take Your Partners Please! Christmas Ball,"We are dancers and some of the music was not great to dance to. But it was OK, We would just use what ever songs we could"
3,FUN gift!,Fun gift! Just don't put in diswasher. Interior cracks. Should not drink from after glaze is compromised. Must be hand washed.
4,mister buddwing,"Excellent camera work, interesting story that kept me involved to the end -all actors did great job and james garner was very believable in the amnesiac role, similar to the part he played in another film ,36 Hours- great twist ending as well"
4,kids watch,perfect for my 7 year old who needed the extra numbers (second hand hints) as is learning to tell time. Pretty color. She likes it alot so far.
4,"Pretty, purple watch, but not waterproof","I had purchased another one of these last December for my daughter and it stopped working when it got wet. To be fair, she accidently dropped it in water for a second. The packaging does state that the watch is water-resistant, not water-proof."
3,A mixed review,"When I read about this film, I was anxious to see it. The ideas around sexual orientation and confusion are often dealt with as comedy or simply in passing.Denied does explore these issues, and has an interesting story. The acting is solid in most cases. It was clearly filmed on the cheap, and it seems a decision was made to try to cover the cheap with 'art'. Somehow, someone decided that throwing in bizarre cuts, strange noises, etc, would distract us from that problem. Problem is, it distracts us from the story. It can be a strain to follow, and really takes away from the story. A better script or edit would certainly help.At the same time, it offers an interesting examination of sexuality in the context of some very believable charicters. Worth seeing, but do not set your expectations too high -- especially if the cover has you expecting soft porn or light romantic fare."
4,"Moving, worthwhile story","I'm going to agree with a lot of what's been said about this film. It definitely was very low budget, but I do think that the movie is poorly lit on purpose to indicate that the characters are more or less in the dark about their direction. It's a little unclear what Merrick, the object of Troy's affection, truly wants. There's the possibility that Merrick is a user who gives Troy a tiny bit of what he wants because he needs someone to pay the rent. Also, there's the possibility that the movie was saying that the atmosphere of small-town Canada makes a gay relationship more or less impossible.It's also possible that we don't know the answer to these questions because we can't hear the dialogue half the time. I think this is really a nice film and the DVD should be re-released with subtitles."
1,Horrible,What's it about? I don't know. I couldn't tell you. I got bored and stopped paying attention. I can tell you that the video and audio are just terrible in this movie. Have you ever yelled into a tape recorder and heard that screeching sound in the feedback? That's what this movie sounds like. It's unwatchable.
2,"Second-rate film: good idea, just not executed properly","If you are, like me, inclined to watch more gay films than any other, watching for that kiss, that magical moment where they touch or have that indescribable presence together; well, I'm just as sorry as you are--this movie simply doesn't have it. If I'm honest, what attracted me to the movie was the cover, and Troy (Lee Rhumohr) is absolutely gorgeous, and the concept of the movie seemed good. Unfortually, this movie disappointed me, not just because there were no moments in the film that I explained earlier, but because the sound quality is really awful and the acting is mediocre, at best, and quite simply, although I tried my damnest to get into the movie, I basically couldn't because there is no hook, or sinker in this film. After watching this movie I felt completely unfulfilled, and that's the truth."
1,Waste of time - AGAIN,"Whatta drag is this film! I regret spending every single second in front of the screen.There is no action and acting is really nothing.Add VERY poor quality of sound, light etc. and you get ""Denied"".Such cinema nightmares should be banned!"
3,Great Chemistry between the Leads but Little Else,"I give this film 3 stars on the basis of the smoking chemistry between Troy (Lee Rhumohr) and Merrick (Matt Austin) but there is not much else to recommend it. The story is intriguing for awhile - the gay jock in the small town is in love with his best friend/party boy in denial- but the psuedo-affair goes nowhere. The additional complications of girlfriends and poolhalls are a waste of time and the film is shot with a look and feel like a high school project. That's a shame, because this could have been so much more. As for the acting, Rhumohr's performance is solid and sincere and Austin is heartbreaking as the object of Rhumohr's affection. Austin's Merrick just does'nt get it until it is too late although loose ends are tied up nicely."
1,DON'T RENT IT OR BUY IT!!!,"This review doesn't say anything that hasn't already been said, but it's a shame this movie is somehow sitting here with a massive 2.5 star rating! Dreck! Awful sound, poor picture quality, dumb as dirt story line. One can barely understand the dialogue, and all the scenes are, for some reason, shot during the night time, which further contributes to the dim, dull picture. Just like the title says, I watched this movie hoping for something, and was summarily DENIED anything!"
2,Not the miracle I anticipated...,"I ordered the Miracle Blanket because a few of my friends swore by its magical powers. Unfortunately, my three month old was way too long, so he could easily kick his way out of the foot slot. After he successfully removed his legs from the blanket, he was wide awake. This scenario occurred for three consecutive nights, and I gave up on the Miracle. Either I have a Houdini, or this is not the miracle most people need for their older newborn."
4,great product,I got this a little to late to use with my son (4mo old) I would recommend this to people with newborns that still like to be swaddled
4,Love it. Only change would be the foot pouch!,"We bought this after a disastrous experience with the Halo Swaddlesack. Our pediatrician recommended the miracle blanket. It is easy to use, safe, and works well. Without swaddling he wakes up after 5 minutes of being laid down. With a swaddle on we get 1 hr to 3 hr naps and a 5.5 hr long stretch at night (not bad for a 6 week old).Our little man is big (born 9lbs 3oz), strong, and active. He broke free of other swaddles. The armstraps on the miracle blanket keep his hands secure all night!Only issue is he can kick his feet out of the pouch and this will wake him up. The solution for us is to have him sleep in a nightgown under the swaddle. He cannot seem to get his feet out of both so it works. However, I wish the company would fix this design flaw."
5,Amazing,"This swaddle blanket is simply amazing. After my son was born, it was about a month of sleepless nights, and then my son finally began to sleep 4-5 hour stretches through the night on his own. That was until he hit 4 months, then he began constantly waking up every 30 minutes to an hour once again. My wife and I thought we had passed this stage, so needless to say, we were pretty stressed to be barely sleeping again. I found this on Amazon through a simple search, and regardless of the reviews, I decided this probably wouldn't work but why not give it a try. Boy was I wrong - it's like this blanket literally hits a sleep switch in my sons brain. He is literally sleeping for hours and hours at night now - to the point we generally have to wake him up in the morning to feed and change him. If you are a parent to a young one and you enjoy sleep, GET THIS."
3,Not a miracle for us.,"I bought two of these out of desperation when my 3 month old son was breaking out of his SwaddleMe swaddles several times a night. I thought that since this pinned his arms down, it would be impossible for him to break out of. I was wrong. He has broken out of this several times now. The swaddle itself is ok, the material is a bit stiffer and scratchier than I'd like, but its not bad. I ended up finding a video tutorial online - the ""double swaddle how to"" on you tube. I tried it this afternoon and he slept for 3 hours - thats the best nap we've had in AGES. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Didn't work for my kid,"A friend told me this blanket really was a miracle for her because nothing else helped her kid to sleep. It didn't work for my kid, though. My kid doesn't like to be wrapped up. It's design looks unnecessarily complicated."
1,didn't like,"Bought 2 and returned one. I didn't like how it strapped the arms down, it was too intrusive and wakes the baby up. Also, it wraps around so many times, it ends up with a buch of blanket under the baby and when you lie him down, he is more reclined."
4,pricey but good,"while i think the blanket is over priced, it has worked really well for my new born. it is the only swaddle he is not able to get out of. I just wish I had it for my first colicky baby..."
5,Appropriately named product!,"I have tried the swaddle with a regular receiving blanket and it always seem to fall off, plus it involves some skill. I have tried other swaddling blanket products which involve Velcro (sounds nice), they do not work if your baby is not the right size, or the grow. This blanket has allowed my son to sleep from about 10 am to about 4-5 am at six weeks! Make sure to buy two so you have a back up in case of an accident. Happy sleeping."
3,Didn't work for my 2 month old who doesn't like to be swaddled...plus a bit overpriced.,"I SO wanted to give this 5 stars and say ""It truly is a miracle...my baby slept through the night!"" Darn!My little guy has never liked to have his arms swaddled so I should have known better than to buy it. I think if I had gotten it earlier like when he was a newborn it may have worked which is why I am still giving it 3 stars, but he was 2 months old when I got it and maybe already set on his sleeping preferences? He didn't like being wrapped in it, but allowed me to do it anyway and he did fall asleep. I checked on him 1/2 hour later and he had both legs out. Checked on him an hour later and he had both arms out! How I will never know, this thing is like a strait jacket! So unfortunately he didn't sleep any longer than normal...4 hours on the dot like always.One last thing, I think $19.99 is more reasonable than $29.99...it is only fabric!"
5,Amazing!,My 12 week old got out of every other swaddle and woke up between 5 and 7 times every night. The first night we used this blanket he woke only twice!!! I'm here buying my 2nd today (can't risk a diaper leak without a backup). It is already helping him nap longer too.
5,Awesome blanket!,Our son really benefitted from being swaddled but he would always break free when swaddled with a regular blanket. This would agitate him and his uncontrollable arms would wake him up. We tried the miracle blanket and he slept longer than ever before! It's impossible for him to break free from the swaddle giving him (and us) very restful nights. I highly recommend this blanket!!
5,They won't get out of this!!,"My son is really strong and he can't unswaddle himself from this, unlike everything else we've tried. The result, 8-10 hours of sleep straight through at night. Worth $30 easily!"
5,Baby Miracle Blanket,This item was a gift for a newborn. I have heard that these miracle blankets are excellent for newborns.
3,A Pain in the Middle of the NIght,"While this product is better for swaddling than a blanket, we've been more impressed with the SwaddleMe product. We found this item to be a pain at night (when you are half awake). Trying to undo it to change the baby is a pain and then the fact that you have to hold the baby up while wrapping him up in it is also a pain (and can wake a sleeping baby). The SwaddleMe product can be bundled up without waking the baby or moving them much. We were disappointed with the Miracle Blanket and switched back after 2 nights."
2,Too Complicated,"Not what I expected. Never understood the directions and, after learning how to swaddle at the hospital, this was more complicated. After the first month, if the baby is strong enough to unwrapped himself, then this product becomes a good idea."
4,Switched swaddling blankets after a few weeks,"I got this when my now 4 month old was almost a week old hoping it would help my little one sleep better. The swaddling defiantly helped! Swaddling and a fisher price rock n play and by 2 months old my son was almost sleeping through the night! I used the Miracle blanket for a few weeks then I switched to the aden and anais muslin swaddling blankets because it was easier when doing night time diaper changes. Be careful when using the miracle blanket in warmer weather as my September baby frequently got to hot in this and I would have to unwrap him thus defeating the purpose of keeping him in a calming swaddle when he was fussy. Overall, I like the Aden and Anais swaddling blankets better once i figured out how to swaddle my son tight enough in them."
4,Only thing that kept my babys arms down,This is the only swaddle product tha kept my baby's arms down. He never got his arms out.He did get his legs out because th bottom does not attach to anything and if he kicked hard enough he could kick it out of the swaddle. That is the only downside.
5,Works just like it should!,My baby smiles every time I put him in his miracle blanket. I wish I would have gotten it sooner. I didn't get it tell he was 8 weeks old. He loves it and before I would swaddle with a regular blanket and my son would always get his arms out and that would wake him cause he would knock his paci out with his hands while sleeping. Now he is snug as a bug in his miracle blanket!! This is my 3rd baby and I have never used one of these before and if I have another baby I will for sure have one before the next kids even born!! Also I have a big baby he was 9lbs 10oz at birth and it fits him no problem. He is 13lbs. 6oz. and 23.5icnehs long right now and we are still using it at 10 weeks old. Highly recommend it!!
4,Thank you,Good transaction. Shipped slower than I would have liked but still got the book in time to use it in my class. Thank you!
4,Instant Classic!!!!,"I read others comments before buying this album, people gave it s***t for not living up to Overkill guess what... it surpasses it!! Stone Dead Forever, Bomber, Sharpshooter, Dead men tell no tales, Over the top, Plus the live version of a few of the songs. There both great albums, and if your a fan of the golden years of Motorhead(Lemmy, Philthy, Eddie) youl love em! Buy both! But buy Bomber first!!"
3,ive heard better,motorhead are like legends and bomber could carry on the tradition except for a few bad songs
3,Could have been better,"I'm a big fan of fairytale retellings and am always exited to find something new I've never heard of before but I have to say, East wasn't my absolute favorite. The problem was that the original Norwegian story this book was based on was written purely for little kids and had a lot of repetition witch really didn't give the author all that much to go off of. I guess my biggest complaint was that the book was just too long, there was too much empty space for the reader to get bored and though it was kind of a nice change that the girl saves the guy I have to say it was a little slow."
3,Flawed fairy tale,"I thought the book was quite interesting when it came to the plot, but the narating was horrific. Each character tells their own story of the present, past and future, not allowing a lot of detail regarding the surroundings and an out of the box point of view. It doesn't give the story the credit it should aquire from the reader. The thought is there but that is all. The plot is an exquisite and labyrinthine addition to the notorious fairy tale of ""Beauty and the Beast""; allowing you to grasp a little more of the story behind the beast and the beauty. Though the writing is annoying, reading this story is a must."
1,Skimmed through much of it,"After a while, the reading gets mundane. There were many passages that read:'I walked through the darkly lit hallways. It was cold. I pulled the lamp in front of me to see better. The wind died down. I shivered...""Much of the story was in 'essay-speak' form and didn't read like a story at all. The plot itself is interesting which is why I gave it 1 star.I think the story would have been better written in third person rather than from the many viewpoints of the characters in the story. This format would have been fine if each character had a distinct voice but all of them sounded the same. Really, it almost seems like Pattou made more of a book-mache of journal entries or even drafts and just put them together. The characters were only two dimensional and the writing with no feeling or character.Your better off reading the actual fairy tale itself, with all it's loopholes and consider that a satisfying read versus 400 or so pages of this."
2,5 for story...1 for originality...,"I liked this book alot, but it is almost an EXACT copy of my favorite book ""The Golden Compass,"" by Philip Pullman. His book is about a girl who goes to the North to cross a bridge made by the northern lights (might I add she is accompanied by a pansbjorne: aka. polar bear) even the words are similiar: philip pullman's polar bear is called a pansbjorne--hers is called an isbjorne or something similiar. It is mention more than once in Edith Pattou's book a bridge that connects the spirit world to the regular world made out of the northern lights: that EXACTLY the same thing in ""the golden compass!"" What really makes me angry is that in all of her interviews they ask ""What books inspired you?"" she doesn't even mention ""the golden compass!"" and OBVIOUSLY she read it cause its EXACTLY the same!!!!"
5,Really Great,I have read this book about 8 times and i have to say that i can never get enough of it! its a really great story about a young girl named Rose who is taken from her family by a white bear and is to live with him for two full moon phrases. I absoulty loved this book and recomended for people of all ages!
4,great fairy tale re-telling,"It was a great re-telling of the East of the Sun West of the Moon story that used that basic framework but then spun a truly original story. The characters were interesting, the writing was good, he form was interesting where it was told from different viewpoints, and it had a satisfying ending. It was a good YA story with thought-provoking themes. I was struck with the idea that life revolves around the day-to-day tasks of living. They are what make living worthwhile."
5,Books books,The book came quick. It was for my granddaughter she loves the book series. It will give her something to read over the holiday.
2,Looks like i stand alone on this...,"I was disapointed by East. My number one reason being that i never felt any connection between Rose and ""The Man who was a White Bear"". The person with the most emotion in the book was Rose's brother Neddy, not the girl who was treking the globe in a search to find her lost ""friend"" who seemed to forget her a bit to easily if you ask me, slank or no slank. Not to mention there just always seemed to be to easy a solution at hand for every problem. I mean, sure there always has to be SOME solution but the way she got into the Ice Palace? *shrugs*. The story definately had it's good points. It was a breeze to read once you started it, and the journey itself was exciting (i loved Malmo the most)."
4,Fun Read,"I liked this book. it was a relaxing and fun read. i read it in about a week. the characters are real you feel like you know them. plot is origonal and great totaly new ideas! Pattou did a great job with land scapes and working in little deatalse that make this book seem more realistic. it is slightly slow in a few parts but still it is wonderfuly composed and gets your attention, despite that. a great read all ages would enjoy it!"
4,East of East,"I always love the 'East of the Sun and West of the Moon' story and was curious to read this one. It turned out like reading a fairytale put into the real world, with places and time in history. It was so amazing :) and the heroine not just win the white bear then married him, happily ever after. This book gave a more believable start, process, climax and ending with help from magic since the cursed bear was born out of magic (the goblin's) too so it was only fair.I only have small problems in reading it. There were some dialog/thought not properly put into a character and they sometimes made me stop for a while to think it over. I also feel the start was kinda slow. But overall, I enjoy this story of Rose and her White Bear, specially about the birth-direction myth.A fairytale came to life :)"
5,Captivating,"I read the first half of this book yesterday, and sat down for a little while this morning and found myself zipping through the last 250 pages. This is a wonderful story that hooked me from start to finish. It combines bits and pieces from the following tales: Beauty and the Beast, Cupid and Psyche, and East of the Sun West of the Moon. (I'd never even heard of the latter, but I found the original story online, so I'll read it asap!) Fans of Shannon Hale's retellings are sure to enjoy East."
4,Satisfying,"As a related fairy tale to Beauty and the Beast, I pounce on East of the Sun, West of the Moon retellings. It might have been overkill, but I decided to read this novel and Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow by Jessica Day George, one right after the other.Outcome: While East is engaging and well-written, I think it suffers by comparison with Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow. I had trouble getting into East at first because of the meandering way it began, but once the story got properly started, I did enjoy it very much. It has a different tone from Sun and Moon, but nevertheless offers a satisfying retelling of East of the Sun, West of the Moon."
5,intellectually stimulating lyrics,"Although not produced by the RZA, this Wu-Tang cd really harnesses the power of the Wu-Tang philosophy and way of life. The beats are engaging and riveting, while still maintaining the street edge that makes them so addicting. Kilah Priest's lyrics are not only thought provoking, but enchanting and mesmerizing making the cd a must have in any music collection."
3,"Lyrically intese, but the beats seem lifeless","Killah Priest's Heavy Mental is one of the most lyrical albums to drop on the scene this whole year. The problem is that Heavy Mental isn't that enjoyable to listen to, due to the lifeless production. Only 3 of the album's 21 tracks deliver head nodding beats. But if you're into lyrics like I am, pick this LP up, cuz wack beats or not, this kid can drop science."
5,Defenely a classic album...,"It can't get any better then diz right here man... Listing to killah's voice ? Its hip-hop! If you already haven't buy killah priest's "" heavy mental"" coz the beats are sick and his lirycs? Out of this world."
2,What is Rap Music?,"Rap music is just that, rap and music. Good lyrics can only do so much for bad music, and vise-versa. KP may have a lot of insightful things to say, and his delivery is one of the most original around. But as a package, this CD doesn't get the job done. Bad music = mediocre review."
5,A Runner for Best Hip Hop Album Ever,"It's probably impossible to say what is THEE best Hip Hop album ever. But there are only a few albums that are possibly winners. Heavy Mental is one of them. His ridiculously gifted wordplay, the mystic production, the intelligent context, are all way more advanced than the majority of popular music released during the late nineties. Actually ever. A must have album"
1,I WANY MY CASH BACK!!!,"CD's should be catergorized in two simple ways: Worth buying and not worth buying. This one is NOT worth buying. I love the Wu and their spinoffs but this album is the WORST. Too slow, too boring, too bad, too plain. I wish I never saw the Wu emblem on the CD cover..."
2,"Green, not khaki.","I bought these in khaki for work. Problem is I can't use them for work, because in florescent light they are green. They are perfectly khaki in natural light, but in a big box retail store they are green. Yep, definitely green."
2,The easiest to find henna paste ...,"I've tried the Schweta brand of henna a few times over the course of my career as a henna artist, and it has always disappointed me. It's very easy to find a tube for under $5 at most Indian grocery stores.Mixing your own henna is a much better way to go. Buying this kit might be a bit useful so that you can see what consistency the paste has, so you can keep that in mind when making your own."
4,"Great starter kit, wish it came with applicator","This starter kit is great in the sense that it came with the mixing powders, paste, oils, a booklet, and design ideas, but it does not come with any sort of applicator! Your have to buy that separately. Most starter kits usually include this."
3,"Great book, edited poorly","The condition of the book was excellent and it arrived quickly. Very happy with the seller, but the editing of the book is very sloppy. It can be confusing to read as foot notes pop up haphazardly and there are several typos. Most notably using 'arc' instead of 'are' among others."
4,"I laughed, I cried, I understood.","I just finished Susan Brackney's Lost Sole Companion. Even though I don't suffer from depression, I have worked closely with those who do in the television and film industry. This book helped me understand what goes through these peoples' minds and how they approach day to day things. I commend Ms. Brackney for her courage to write such an introspective piece of work. It had me laughing in parts, crying in others and shaking my head in disbelief at times. If you have depression or know someone who suffers from this affliction, the Lost Sole Companion is a great find!"
3,"Thanks, Susan.","For me the most inspiring part of the book is her phrase ""I wrote Lost Soul Companion because it didn't exist and I wished it did.""I enjoyed the book, and found some of it useful, but I did wish it had covered topics in more depth, especially the ""surviving on your art"" vs ""taking a real job"" issue. I wish the author had covered in more detail her own experiences trying to make it in the California art world. What was that like, and what made her give it up and return to the midwest? That might be something she could cover in Volume II, which I hear is now in the works.Also suggested: interviews with artists at various levels of ""success,"" meaning ability to support themselves. Also, interviews with other creatives on their way of solving the problem of art vs money.Still, thanks Susan, for your honesty and your desire to create community for other artists."
1,Robin's Review,"ridiculous, useless, and written very immaturely. She states the obvious, and does it very poorly. Also the images are displayed poorly on Kindle."
5,Vietnam War Reflection,"This is the best book of war poems since ""The Leaves of Grass"". The experiences of a young US Infantry Officer, during three years of combat in Vietnam, reflected in the form of photographs, essays, and poems. The most important question asked at the time by everyone was, whether the communist or the democratic way of life would remain standing. All of those who fell were very young, for the most part handsome young men, who followed the orders they were given to obey, and the examples set for them by their fathers, and grandfathers. Fear and death were hard to confront, day in and day out, when the ones at home, who could have lent moral support, ridiculed and abused those who did the fighting. The work takes the reader into the action, or its contemplation, with all the pain, and sadness, that was, is and will always remain in the American conscience and the resultant consequences to a generation of their own sons and daughters"
5,Super for the money!,"Nice and warm. If you have a REALLY large head, their largest size WILL fit you! That's been an on-going problem for me. But this one fits great and is quite warm. The snaps on the ends of each ear flap are a nice touch."
4,A Time Remembered,"This is the passion-packed epic of the Bouchards, whose fate is intertwined with a South fighting for her life - overrun with carpetbaggers and overreacting with the Ku Klux Klan. At Windhaven Plantation, Luke Bouchard and his family thrive. Laure is pregant again and a small chapel is built in remembrance of a promise made. Luke, urged by loyal Republicans to enter the political arena, takes a dramtic step and runs for Republican representative in the state congress. Luke faces enemies and outrageous slander. Sixth book in the Windhaven series."
3,Very artistic movie,"I ordered this DVD based on the recommendation of a friend. I wasnt sure what to expect. This isnt your typical surf movie, with agro shots of young surfers tearing it up. Its a movie about shapers, the love and soul that shapers put into the boards and the different people riding the different types of waves. It is a highly creative and thoughtful film, but also a little slow."
1,Waste of Money,"THis camera [doesn't work well], Is was never made leave the top of your desk, The pics were low quality and resolution [was poor]. I am glad i bought it at [a retail store] so i could return it no questions asked."
1,Can't get it to work,"I bought this camera awhile ago but just got around to trying it out. I was able to install the software and use the camera, but when I tried to connect the camera to my computer, no matter what I did, I could not get my computer to recognize the hardware. The device manager software will not recognize that the camera is even plugged in. I went to Aiptek's website and it turns out that this is a compatibility problem with Windows XP (even though the camera is advertised as being compatible with XP), but I have yet to find a solution to the problem that works for me. I ignored XP's warnings about installing drivers that Microsoft have not verified, just as the Aiptek site suggests, but that only crashes my computer. Aiptek's customer support staff has yet to respond to my email about this issue. I have read two other reviews that reference this problem: one with the solution of plugging in the USB cable into the camera first, then the computer. This did not work."
2,Cant let it work,"I bought this product a year ago, and it really is good while taking still photographs and it worked quite well with online chat with windows 98. But lately i have downloaded the windows xp o/s ignoring the warns, And when I connected this product again to my computer, the computer fails to recognize the product. I am sending this review to give me solution and not just to print it to your customers review column. This product is quite impressive but after this problem I have degraded it."
2,Aiptek Products,"I love this little camera, to a point. You can take pictures, videotape ect.. ""As long as you have the EXTRA STORAGE"", I can record voices (not like a tape recorder but good enough) but I can only download my pictures and such I can not use any of the programs with it, my computer is VERY NEW and it will not except the camera (I have another one INTEL ""I use it as a web cam, that shows up on my computer but I cannot get the Pocket DV 3100 to load) Web cam??? Forget that; Don't bother with writing the company via E-MAIL, they won't respond! We have been trying for weeks now and still we are waiting to hear back! We have three different cameras by them and none work as a web cam! Good luck if you purchase this product."
4,good value,"Pretty good for the money. Will hold 250 jpegs of VGA quality, over 3 minutes of AVI (1/2 VGA at 10 fps) or 1/2 hour of audio only. Changes I would recommend would be to make the microphone more directional (operator's voice is over-modulated while the subjects voices could use some gain). Also, relocate the audio button as I keep pressing it unintentionally. A little better power management would be nice too (the battery gauge is next to useless). I like the size and price though, and the output quality is fine as long as you don't need to print anything. Also, you need their software to upload the photos/movies/audio to your computer. It would be nice if it was more plug-n-play with anybody's computer, perhaps seeing the camera as another drive (read only, of course) when plugging in the USB port (though, to be fair, I'm not aware of any competing product that works this way)."
1,not compatible with XP?,"bought this last night but would not work with my home edition windows XP. ""Software not digitally signed by windows"" message kept popping up promting to stop installation. So, although i ignored the message the camera never worked."
2,Not even good enough.............,"I bought this mainly for the video aspect. I wanted to take the video and burn it onto a vcd and play it on a 20 inch tv. This camera performs very poorly. If it were 30 bucks, maybe it would be worth it, but it isn't. Every time you play video, you can see the pixels. Also the colors are VERY bad. They all have a redish tint. Also i decided to check out the photo qualities and realized that they are also very poor. If you move it slightly, the image becomes blurry and grainy. This really isn't even good for anything. Nowadays for this price of 60 dollars, you can get 1 megapixel cameras. Which perform MUCH beter than this camera. It's going back to the store."
4,"Hey, it's not bad","This isn't a bad camera, if you dont want to take serious pictures. Of course you cant make any prints, but i took back a 2.1 megapixel camera and bought this one. I bought this bc it had a video feature, and being a ... gadget, i didnt expect alot from it. it takes up to 3min 20 sec video w/sound or 30 min of sound, 450 pictures. The pictures arent bad at highest quality, just use it online and on the computer. Dont expect to print these. There is no flash so use it in bright places or in sunlight. if kinda dark, the video will have reddish tint and wont be that great. This is good for beginners and ages 12- 21. It comes with good software. one thing that fooled me is that it said it had 128m sdram. IT ONLY HAS 16M. that was the only down side, but i was a fool for thinking that in the first place. Get this cam if you're new to cameras or just dont feel like paying paying [$$$] for a toy."
2,Buy anything else by JCC first. This is for fanatics and completists only,"Bad recordings, and weak work. I own all of Johnny's recording including 45rpms, and I own this in two versions but I can't recommend this unless you have to have everything.Buy:Zip Style MethodSnap, Crackle & BopDisguise in Loveand you'll have 95% of what he has out there and 98% of his best stuff."
3,If you were there...,"Perhaps this album is just for completists but it would also serve well for those familiar with the other more polished albums who never had the chance to see JCC live. I did see him at the now long-gone, missed and infamous 'Tradies' (The Trade Union Club in Surry Hills, Sydney) in the early 80s and this cd takes me back to that sweaty, loud, raucous, in-yer-face gig when the black-clad bean-pole thin wordsmith assaulted, insulted and occasionally consulted with the audience, backed by a small tape-recorder providing beats for his utterings. A great night and this cd reminds me of it, although JCC is for the most part more restrained and more polite here than he was there. Despite the occasional muddy bootleg quality sound exhibited here it still remains a great document of an original and forward-moving talent on the rise and is well worth a listen."
5,great choice!!,"have to say this product really made my life easier!! i live in the city on the 5th floor in my bldg. i recently built an enclosed music studio in my garage space...installed this product and the LINKSYS WRT54GX4 IEEE 802.3/3u, IEEE 802.11b/g Wireless-G Broadband Router with SRX400 and life is good!!! 4 outta 5 bars for signal strength all day long with no dropped signals from 5 floors away!! took me a minute to dial in the right security to work with my ISP but once that was done i have not looked back. life as a musician in an apt has not looked better!!LOL"
5,Wonderful Collection,"'The Simple Truth' is a wonderful collection of poetry. I don't consider myself a very literary person, but I keep reading this collection because of the way Levine captures the human experience so powerfully. 'The Simple Truth' is a beautiful collection that is a joy to read."
4,Illustrations are in black and white,"The book is fine -- good-sized print is easy to read. Just be aware that in this edition (from Yesterday's Classics), the illustrations are in greyscale. If you're using a field guide while reading, this might not matter to you. I couldn't figure this out while deciding which edition to purchase, so I'm typing this quick review so the next person will know. :-)"
3,"Too many facts crammed in, ruins the story flow","As a homeschooler, I've seen this book listed on many book lists for those who prefer the use of 'living books' over textbooks. The book uses story form to convey facts about animals, a method which can sometimes be effective, and sometimes be too dry. In this case, it was the latter. There were simply too many facts crammed in, to the detriment of the stories. My then-6yo daughter and I very much enjoyed Burgess' 'The Adventures of ....' (e.g. Bobby Coon and others) series, and I had expected this book to be similar stories, but these lacked the adventure that we had enjoyed in his other books. My 8yo asked if she could please not read it (I had assigned it), and after reading a chapter myself, I agreed. If you enjoyed Thornton Burgess' 'The Adventures of ...' series, you may enjoy the 'Among the ... People' series by Clara Dillingham Pierson."
2,Not what I expected,"I got this while waiting with my 5yo at the dr office. I was expecting alittle more kid friendly with good pictures. Well it wasnt anything that held my daughters atention thats for sure, but I could have probably enjoyed it if she hadent been annoyed with it."
2,terri,"The cover had a beautiful color picture that suggests color pictures within the book, but it's all in black and white and the animals are very difficult to see. Not At All what I was expecting. I will not give this book to my niece."
1,indoctrination,These Burgess books are so wonderful in many ways. I had gotten them because of the reviews of other CMers. But on almost every page there are references to Mother Nature. We have decided to get rid of these books because God is the Creator and we do not want our children indoctrinated with that phrase over and over again. They actually brought the book to me and told me we needed to get rid of it. They are aware of the creation/evolution debate and discerned this problem themselves.Parables from Nature by Margaret Gatty would be a better choice.
1,Three decent songs don't make a CD.,"I liked The Way and Fire Escape, so i bought the cd. The only song other than those two i can stand is (G. O. D. ) Good Old Days. That's the whole cd about ten minutes of decent music, a lot of crap."
2,Can you say bubble gum?,Lightweight alt rock. Get it if you believe that Matchbox 20 and Seven Mary 3 are the future.
2,Fastball is ok,"Idon't think the cd is worth buying I mean the only good song on there is THE WAY ,all the other songs are crappy if u can just download it from the internet or just tape it from the radio or from someone else's CD DO IT!"
2,The Way saves from total destruction,The Way is the only good song on this cd so just wait for the single. The only songs thet come close to average are nowhere road and fire escape.
5,a great selection of awesome music,"Great CD. Especially songs 1,2,5,and 10. I love it and other people should too."
5,I thimk the CD is the best ever put out,In this CD there is a little bit of everything. It has a little Bettles type of music and it has some good classic rock.
3,"Catchy, but could use more variety.","""All The Pain Money Can Buy"" is a pretty good album but it needs more variety. All the songs sound a little bit the same, although they're all songs that you can nod your head or tap your fingers to. You probably will like most of the songs, but I think you will agree that it could use some more variety. If you like good rock, this is your ticket. If you're not very fond of rock, you wouldn't want this. Fastball is a good band, but you might like some of their other albums more."
5,"Fastball is definitley ""The Way""","This is the most ""down to earth"" music that I have heard in a long time. ""The Way"" is a great song but I personally like ""Which Way To The Top?"" I can't wait for their up coming video, ""Fire Escape"""
4,A great Cd,"I bought this cd because I love the song ""The way"". I was surprised at how much I love ALL the songs. This is a wonderful Cd."
3,"good, but not great...","I bought this for, ""the way"" and more so for ""out of my head"". I had heard ""fire escape"" but didnt care as much for it. My first impression was, gee, i think i just wasted 15 bucks. so I just played ""out of my head"" over and over again to get my money's worth. (i'm still NOT sick of it :> ) but then I decided to give a try and there are many songs on there that are quite catchy and nice. I like ""fire secape"" more now, as well as ""Which way to the top"" (my next fave after the way and out of my head) nad nowhere road. The songs arent too original, I think. They really remind me of many other typical rock bands. I would still recommend hearing all/most of the songs on the album before purchasing it."
4,"Great, but not flawless","This is a pretty good album, though I have heard better. But all and all, I'd reccomend it because it's great stuff; especially compared to all that overplayed boyband crap. I love ""The Way"" and ""Fire Escape."" Strangely enough, I've never really liked ""Outta My Head"" but it looks to be the favorite of all the die-hard Fastball fans."
5,it won't let you go,"i was slow to come around, heard them first live & had to hear more. without hesitation - the best in a long time - start to finish . something for everyone here."
1,all the pain money can by (fastball),awsome. i had looked everywhere for this as they are no longer distibuted and you had a new one!!!! thank you.
4,Fastball is Awesome,"Fastball keeps the hits coming, from their ska-reminiscent G.O.D. (Good Old Days) to their sizzling track The Way, and finally, my favorite, Sooner or Later. All The Pain Money Can Buy is a must-buy for fans. I can't wait for their next one!!"
4,good,"Track 1 is great, as are most of the others. Listen to the whole album before you buy it. That way you will know you definetly want it. Fastball has a fun, ironic, tone to them. Its got ska qualities, as well as rock."
1,One or Two Hit Wonders,I remember hearing The Way on the Radio and thinking. Wow who is that band. I ran out and bought the album and boy was I dissapointed. The rest of the songs were just mediocre. They kind of remind me of the formula bands of the 70's and 80's except they are not as good. Save your money on this one!
2,Highly Overrated,"This is a 2 hit album. ""The Way"" and ""Fire Escape"" are great, but every other song is really less than average. You better be die-hard to buy his 1."
4,A Good Effort With A Couple Of Standouts,"I bought this CD after hearing ""The Way"" on the radio and thinking what a brilliant piece of 1960s-esque pop it was. From the quirky intro to the tight guitar and drum interplay, it really sounded like it could have been a long lost Beatles song covered by a band from Texas.While ""The Way"" is still far and away my favorite song on the CD, there are a couple of other noteworthy standouts, of which ""Fire Escape"" and ""Better Than It Was"" are my personal favorites. Interestingly, those three songs are also the first three on the CD, and from there the music suffers a bit with capable, yet uninspired, writing (although all performances are all quite good.)I like this CD and give it four stars; the first three songs are five star-plus performances, but the rest of the CD fails to keep the pace. Nevertheless, for these guys from Austin, this is a great beginning; I just hope that they don't lose the way."
3,This is not great but not terrible,"I saw Fastball in concert play a short 25 minute set with Sugar Ray and the Goo Goo Dolls. I thought they did pretty well, so I got this cd. I knew it had at least 2 good songs since I heard ""The Way"" and ""Fire Escape"" on the radio before. I was surprised that I counted only 4 songs that I thought were good on the album. The others were ""Sooner Or Later"", and ""Out Of My Head"",even though its a slow song, it's not bad. You should listen to the other songs on the this cd before buying it."
4,Good album,"This is the only album I've heard from this band, but it is a great album. I actually bought it for my girlfriend after I accidentally broke it in my car. She was very happy and grateful to receive another copy, however."
3,Okay but derivative,"If you compare Fastball to the steaming heaps of unmitigated, colorless GARBAGE that is passed off as ""New Rock,"" ""Alt Rock"", or ""Modern Rock"" these days, they sound pretty good, and in a relative assessment, could be considered some sort of vanguard of modern pop music. But my problem with Fastball is this: for example, ""Out of my Head"" is a very catchy song, with nice, spare instrumentation, good harmonies, a lively melody, and a quiet feeling of regret that gives it some poignancy. Unfortunately, the song sounds EXACTLY like Elvis Costello! I thought it WAS Elvis Costello the first few times I heard it. Fastball has definitely shown an ability to write fine pop songs--the question is, will they be able to produce compelling music that doesn't simply ape their influences? Or will they become another Oasis? Perish the thought."
4,music that makes you feel good,"Fastball has an ironic view on life. I used to like it a whole bunch when it was brand new; but now it's like-oh, that old band. I would really love it if they'd make a new CD, but they would have to make their music more fast paced to make America's public happy. Thank you for reading my review."
3,In a word: Mediocre,"Firstly, if you're wondering whether the rest of the album is as good as 'The Way', it's not. I'm not one who usually picks music by what they hear on the radio, or one who listens to radio at all, but i quite liked 'The Way'. I thought Fastball may have some good songs, waiting to be discovered in this album.Alas, this is not the case. The rest of the album is very different to 'The Way', the remaining songs are nothing short of mediocre pop rock with so many influences and polished so clean that no spark of originality remains. Nothing seperates Fastball from the pack, they can write songs, sometimes catchy ones, but their music has no substance to warrant more than a few listens.If you want more original rock music with influences from older artists, try The Shins, The White Stripes, The Strokes or The Vines. Give this one a miss."
2,One hit wonders,"The Way is a great song. Hence, I bought the album. The rest is mediocre at best, and this CD quickly became one that I pop in once in a while to listen to one song, then move on.I recommend buying some other album."
5,Great 80's sound with a splash of the 90's,"This is one of the better new artist out this year. There is not a bad track on the album. It has a song that will fit any mood you are in and it is great driving music. (To help cope with the traffic!!!) Check this one out, it is a must buy."
5,Best full album performance I've heard in years,"I'm sure Fastball will catch heat from the self-appointed ""sophisticated"" rock fans, but if you love great pop music with just a bit of an edge, you will love Fastball. The Way is one of the best singles of the past 15 years. The rest of the album is almost as good. The two lead singers bring balance and variation. If you like late 60's and 70's rock, you'll love this group. Take a little Grass Roots, mix in some Chicago, update their music with 90's lyrics and you have Fastball."
4,Good Album,"This is a good album. Tony has a great voice, and he's a rockin' bass player. Miles can rip it up on the guitar (but can't sing), and Joey rocks hard and fast. The only thing that I didn't really like about this album was that there were too many slow songs that WEREN'T GOOD (Miles?). But if you're looking for a more Green Day-ish sound (with a better singing voice), check out their first album. They all rock hard, fast, and loud."
3,All That Money Can Buy,"Since the debut of Fastball back in the early 90's, their brand of rock and pop music, with a dash of humor, has made them one of the most unlikely groups of our times.Their 1998 album, All The Pain Money Can't Buy, is a true blend of rock and soul that hasn't been on the radio, since Wierd Al Yankovic made it back in the early 80's. The songs are memorable and zany. Each song is true to its skin, like Out Of My Head, and their biggest hit, The Way.Once in a million, a band can really come out of the ground, and into the mainstream with ease, and that is what Fastball has done. I just hope they make another good album like this one."
3,"Only 2 songs I lisen to,,,,,but still good for those 2 songs","I remeber seeing this while I was down in the Florid Keys at Kmart if I remember right and I loved that song the way its sounds great and its real mysterious to its about a gorup of teens that wear suppost to show up to family re-union but never did..... but anyway whean I saw it, it was addecting I HAD to buy it alough I dont go beyond track 2,,,,, Iam glad I own it!I suggeust buying it, its somthing youde love to lisening to on long road trips or plane rideso wheanever."
5,The first in the chronicles and the best.,Great book. I first watched the movie when it came out and loved it. Then I just had to read the books. I must say I loved the book more than the movie. I guess there is only so much you can put into a 2 hour movie. If you are thinking about reading the chronicles go for it you will not be sorry.
5,Thirst Quenching,"One of the very few classic novels of the 20th century. Anne Rice creates a beautifully rich universe that is irresistible and loveable, no matter what kind of books you enjoy. There isn't any way you couldn't love this book"
3,first of the vampire chronicles books,"I've read this book several years ago i believe, and i guess i can say this is a so-so book. Reason i'm rating this book 3 stars is because there are a lot of confusing parts and i had to re-read most of them to get some sense in what they meant. And her language was very confusing. Still it was so and so, not good not bad.LOuis becomes a vampire by Lestat and the two live together with Claudia."
3,It's ok.,"This book starts very, very slow, but picks up quickly and finishes very well! When you read it, stick with it through the dull parts, it's worth it."
3,eh.......,"It was ok not the greatest. Maybe because I watched the movie before I read the book. Although I did like the differences between the two. But Louis was just starting to annoy me. Got really boring and some parts. Lestat was alright but over al the coolest person was the little girl ""Claudia"". She was just pure evil. I loved her she was the greatest. She was the only reason i read almost all of it. She was just horrible it was great. It was over all an all right book......just read the book before the movie...."
5,A Book that will Leave you Spellbound and Wanting More,"For some this book may seem inappropiate for a 14 year old girl, but I found the book intriging..It captures you in a story of love, horror, and tradgity...I couldn't put it down...I read when ever I had a chance I took every oppertunity I had. This book is amazing! It is the best book I have ever read..I am starting on the 2nd of the cronicles now..If you read Interview with the Vampire, you can't stop with just that one book...And if you still don't beleive me on how tradgicly beautiful this book is, then read it for yourself (there are a few typos in this review, please disregard them)"
5,Chilling,Anne Rice has a way with words that send chills up your spine and that make it impossible to put the book down. I love her point of view on vampires. This is not your normal vampire story. Must read!
4,Excellent Beginning,"Anne Rice establishes a strong framework with her first novel in the Vampire Chronicles series. I read this novel after finding the movie a delicious addition to the Vampire myth. Upon reading the book, I enjoyed every twist, turn, and detail that gave the book such a lush feel. I love this book simply because it establishes a world within a world: the character's are so colorful one cannot seem to place them anywhere else but in the world of fiction but the realistic settings and the provacative emotions make one think that these characters are real and that Lestat, Louis, and the others are real beings existing in our world.This book I believe is our modern-day Dracula and a good read for anyone interested in vampires in general, but also for anyone interested in devastatingly human relationships, emotions, and struggles"
5,Love this!,"I seriously love this book. This had me hooked from the first page. I couldnt put it down. The story is just incredible and leaves you craving more, especially with that ending. i'll give nothing away but you'll be thankful that it is such an expansive series once you finish the first."
4,Sinister and Intriguing,"Anne Rice is a compelling writer. Interview with the Vampire is sinister, compelling and intriguing. The only thing was toward the end I found my concentration waivering a bit. I have read this book twice and it has been the same each time. I think some areas ramble a little too long. Still it is a great read and I recommend it highly."
5,Think Dracula's The only Vampire out There?,"Guess again baby. There's a whole other world of vampires that you could only dream out until Anne Rice put pen to paper and Louis came out to all the world spilling secrets of vampire lore in this the first of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicals.This truely was an eye opener for me. I read it at age 18 fresh out of high school looking for something other than plan old romance novels to read. I was initially shocked that someone would write about vampires as people with feelings, emotions coupled with Anne's love of history. I found it to be exciting and romantic. But i must be truthful there is a lull in the middle of the book to watch for but give it a try you will like it. Even if you hate the movie."
4,Almost perfect,"Interview with The Vampire is told from the view of Louis,the brooding immortal with plenty to say.Considering 98% of the book is in quotation marks.So why only 4 stars you ask?It's a bit confusing and most of it isn't cleared up until the second book, The Vampire Lestat.Personally,I couldn't finish it at first.I read about half of it and then skipped to the very ending,and I'm usually a very patient person.However,once I read The Vampire Lestat and re-read Interview with The Vampire I fell in love with it.Such emotion in both extremes,love and hate,can only be put down on paper through Anne Rice's pen.Or typewritter,or whatever,you get the point.Louis is a lovely creature who loves the clever Claudia,trapped in the body of a child,but not without a womans rage and Lestat is a devious little devil with his own plans in store for his 'innocent' fledglings.Or perhaps they'll get the better of him.An absolute MUST read."
3,"I give it 3 stars, however................................","Interview with the Vampire is ok. It is a little too much involved with this love affair between Claudia and Louie. It still makes for a fascinating read.The real reason you want to read this book, however, is because of all the books after this. After you read this book, they just get better and better. The next book, The Vampire Lestat is excellent, as Lestat is the coolest character. After that, The Tale of the Body Thief is even more interesting and I found that it occupied much of my time until it was done. The Queen of the Damned is by far, however, the best book in the entire series. I couldn't put this one down until I was done. Memnoch the Devil is equally spellbounding, but I still prefer Queen of the Damned. That is as far as I have gotten in the series so please give it a try."
4,As described,"The book is good, but I felt like the writer somehow stretching the events. What can be said in one page, explained in 4."
2,boring,"Boring, I was really expecting more very disappointed. It did not live up to my expectations. The movie was better ,watch it."
5,an amazing vampire history book,this is a beautifully written vampire book. its very atmospheric. everything was great. the only thing i wowld change is that there is a part near the middle-end of the book where louis the vamp dosent talk to or acknowledge the boy he is talking to for like 80 pages...
5,Read this!!,"I have just finished this book a few days ago and I must say that it is one of the best books I have ever read. My only regret is that I have to wait until next week before my local bookstore gets Vampire Lestat, the sequel. I have been interested in reading a 'Vampire book' for some time and I am so grateful that I chose this one."
5,A story of humanity,"Anne Rice's first vampire novel, Interview with the Vampire, is a beautifully written masterpiece. Not only does it bring a new kind of understanding and life to one of history's most horrific monsters but also teaches us how to understand our own humanity."
2,Being a vampire is hhhhaaaaaaaarrrrrddddd,"Having read Interview and the first half of Lestat, I have to say that Anne Rice seems to have this remarkable talent for psychologically masochistic characters. I simply couldn't sympathize with them. Louis simply refused to be happy. Whenever it started to look like he might be happy, he figured out some way to make himself miserable again. ""I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints,"" no longer has any meaning, because now all the sinners do is whine, whine, whine. I mean, if you're a vampire, you're damned for eternity, you might as well enjoy it."
4,Tai's QuickViews: Four 1/2 Stars)),"Unlike Meyer's Twilight series, Rice's first book in the Lestat cannon oozes with Vampire-lore. Examples:1. extra sensitive hearing: ""beating of the drum"" (referring to the man's heart)2. don't drink after their [hosts] dead or you'll be pulled into darkness and die3. vampires increase through a kind of slavery4. vampires move really fast (Lestat's outstretched arm was a blur to ""the boy"")"
2,not the kind of book that I would normally read,"I found this book to be okay. I am not a big fan of the horror genre and the only reason I read this book was for a class. If I didn't have to read this book, I wouldn't read it for fun. The whole notion of vampires is not something I enjoy reading about."
1,Very disappointing,"I adore Miss Rice's ""The Witching Hour"" and so curled up for what I thought would be an equally good read. What a disappointment. The writing is quite banal, and unlike some of her other writings you never get the opportunity to know the characters in any depth. I was so disappointed that I didn't finish the book, which is rare for me."
1,Dull and Vapid,"I had heard much praise for this novel, so I expected it to be a great,intriguing read. This novel turned out to be one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read. It was slow, unappealing, and could have been wrtitten far more laconically. This is the first book that I had to force myself to read, just so I could get through it. Although there were some vibrant parts, overall it was extremely bland."
1,I can't dicribe how stupid this book is.,If I could find a worse book I would. The sentences are so long winded and boring.You can't tell where the discription ends and the story begins.
1,How did this book ever become popular?,Does anyone actually speak this way? I've never read a book with weaker characters or more boring (and unrealistic) dialogue. Stay away from this complete waste of time.
1,"Pure, Unadulterated Drivel","I read this book several years ago. I had a hard time understanding it's concepts and story at the time. Not too long ago I went back and read it and now that I fully understand the content I can honestly say that it is one of the biggest pieces of literary garbage ever written. The characters lack anything that makes them sympathetic. Louis droned on and on and on about how he didn't like killing but he did it anyway. Maybe it's just me but I don't find it interesting when the lead character commits murder. The scene with the girl killed in Paris theatre in full view of the audience was disgusting. If you want to read a novel on vampires, read 'Salem's Lot by Stephen King. Avoid this piece of scum at all costs."
3,It's ok,"Way better than the movie... but still just ok. I like Anne's writing style - it wasn't that. I think it was more the character I didn't jive with. Oh well, on to Lestat."
3,Classic book,"Great book, but compaired to Twilight etc, not as easy a read.One of those books where once you a hundred or so pages in, you can't put it down."
5,Interview with the Vampire,"Every one loves the classic tale of anne rice's interview with the vampire. I love this book this is way better than Twilight, no Twilight dosen't even compare to this wonderful tale that rice has weaved perfectly. I'm currently reading and its great! I recommend it to any one who wants to read a book that holds adventure romance but above all you form a connection to the characters in this book. :)"
4,A Depressive Journey Into Immortality,"I must say few books have made me feel hopeless and deppressed and this is one of them. Anne Rice introduces you to a vampire who hates his own nature and does not have the courage to end his pain. The book is intricately written and is amazing. The one criteria I have for all books I love is that they move me emotionally, and this one succeeded. I do not recommend for you to read this book if you are ""down in the dumps."" It is likely to make you more depressed. Anne Rice is a truly gifted author. The reason I gave Interview With the Vampire four is because the style in which she wrote the book is a little awkward. Rice writes the book all in dialog and as the title suggest it is an interview. I found the dialog confusing at times, but other than that an excellent novel."
5,"As a poet,there's little I can say about how long death last","My words in review of this book are simply an excerpt from a poem I've witten in dedication to the book and it's author...........................................""All its characters, settings, dynamics, conflicts and plots. All its time frames, time zones, erasable time zones and ceturies; are one within one ego trip. Never leaving this place housed in flesh"". -An excerpt from the currently unpublished poem DREAMBOAT ANNE by C. C. Arshagra"
2,Very interesting story,"However, the narrative drags on and on, with very little dialogue. The story suffers somewhat because of the endless streams of narrative."
2,not for weak stomachs,"two and a half stars...first of all, i'm not bashing the book for its subject matter. i'm not a bible-thumping blowhard. as a writer/reader, i keep an open mind to all types of literature, so my review is about the story, not the subject.i admit i don't care much for vampire/goth literature, i rarely watch horror movies, because most horror films are so badly made; same with horror novels. rice is an ok writer, but i never really felt like i was connecting with the story. lestat was actually a fascinating character, in spite of his arrogance.there were actually a few times i wanted to retch, but i finished the book. it just didn't move me. i did love the way rice wrote about louisiana, especially new orleans. i would much rather read "" feast of all saints."
2,Louis! Take a walk on the beach!,"Anne Rice has a way with words. There are scenes in this book which are incredibly vivid and stand out in your memory (whether you like it or not). Many people will tell you about the homoerotic undertone in this book; the only reason they might count as ""undertones"" is because people are pretty blind unless there is a direct, lurid sex scene. We are dealing with one of the worst-matched couples of all time. Lestat is one of the most fascinating anti-heroes I have read about in a long time. Louis, conversely, is a whiner. Hey, catch a clue, Lou! If you don't want to be a vampire anymore, just leave off the sunblock on the beach! Stop agonizing and get over it! Of course, as we see in this book, it is a lot more difficult than that. It's next to impossible to kill a vampire. Just ask Lestat. For imagery I give this book good marks; for Lestat, also good; for Louis, nothing. For plot, well... I guess there was one..."
1,Put a stake in this book!!!,"I am a real fan of horror books and went into this book looking for a good read. I kept reading and reading and the story plodded on and on. I don't know if was Rice's style, the story, or what. I would keep going back to read it, to give the book a chance, but finally I just stopped reading and never finished it. I found the book boring and dull. I eventually wanted to put a stake in this book to put it out of its misery!"
1,A Classic Bore,"I had heard much praise for this novel, so I expected it to be a great, intriguing read. This novel turned out to be one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read. It was slow, unappealing, and could have been wrtitten far more laconically. This is the first book that I had to force myself to read, just so I could get through it. Although there were some vibrant parts, overall it was extremely bland."
1,More serious literature?,"The Amazon article entitled ""kicking the horror habit"" by one Patty Cambell lists this garbage as an introduction to more ""serious"" literature. How foolish of us to think that Edgar Allan Poe & Bram Stoker & Stephen King were not serious compared to this womans choices, who has not the vaguest about what literature is or what it does, joining the other dieticians, psychologists, and technicians who make up Amazon's ""critics"".Patty Campbell is the young adult columnist for Horn Book magazine and the editor of Twayne's Young Adult Author Series and Scarecrow's Studies in YA Lit."
1,Goth Schlock & Vampire Kitsch,"It's unconceivable that a novel this painstakingly dull and anemic could become so successful. Rice's plodding, unbearable exposition signals that she's spent one too many nights in the crypt. This isn't gothic at all; it reads like a Dickens Halloween Carol, with cartoon vampires acting silly and pretentious. I think maybe Anne Rice missed her calling--she should have written travel brochures. Interview With a Vampire is one of the most plastic, contrived pieces of bloodsucking ilk ever written, and Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt did an outstanding job in accentuating its cardboard dullness in the film version"
2,Not good,"Eh....This was a pretty bad letdown for me when I finally got around to reading it.Touted as the definitive work on the Vampire subject, it is more of a long somtimes winding - sometimes quite gripping in fairness - whine fest about how its hard to be a vampire people dont understand them.Okay, I get it. I dont need over detailed descriptions of the minutia.Just tell me a story, and make it interesting....Oh yeah, and it seemed more than a little gay. I dont have anything against homesexuality, I just dont feel like reading a several hundred page often boring tale featuring men in love with other men.I will try the next volume - the vampire lestat - just to make a fair go of this series, but if it isnt better, it will most likely be my last stab at Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles"""
3,It is okay,"Well ive love anne rice she my favorite author, but i dont like this book. louis whine way to much. someway though i feel attracted to louis. if you really want to get hooked to Anne rice's world of Vamps. then read the vampire lestat"
5,Anne Rice's story is simply amazing.,"Interview with the vampire is a sensuous story a about a vampire that discovered too late that there is something more terrible than death and it is eternity.Anne Rice takes us in a travel through centuries and history, there reality and fiction blend to make this story more exiting and amazing. This place whereshe takes us has no boundaries of time, place or space. The best of this story is that it leaves you wandering, thinking and begging for more. If you areone of those that think that Anne Rice's novel Interview with the vampire is more monster's stuff, you better think again"
5,OPENED MY EYES....,"I love Anne Rice.It seems everthing she writes is a masterpiece. No matter how many times I read Interview with The Vampire, I love it more and more. I remember first reading it in high school and since then it's really opened my eyes to reading. I have read almost every Anne Rice book and I have no complaints.Right now Im beginning The newest book and I have no doubt it will be great.Thanks Anne Rice.A must read!!!"
3,Somehow not Drawn,"I thought the book was very well written. Excellent vocabulary and imagery. I found the idea of a vampire with ""human"" feelings"" appealing. Somehow though I just wasn't satisfied with the book... it was missing something I thought. Anyways it might be a book to rent from the library if you want to read it, I wouldn't suggest spending money on it. I wouldn't read it again."
3,Modern gothic,"Rice's works are very self-indulgent and borderline unreadable, but this book is an interesting take on the modern gothic and the vampire legend. Worthwhile for those interested in the gothic form and its evolution, but this is no Dracula."
2,Disappointed,I choose this book because it is on the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list. I have friends who loved this book. I found it boring. I did finish it so I could cross off one more 1001 book. I don't plan on reading her other vampire books.
4,Dark and Lovely,I am not a fan of Anne Rice usually but Interview with the Vampire is a beautiful book. Louis is so tortured throughout the novel that you cant help but feel sorry for him and want things to get better for him. My favorite character however was Claudia. The thought of a little girl with an old soul gave me the creeps and it added a surreal element to the story. If you enjoy gothic novels and (of course) vampires then give this book a try. Anne Rice has a tendency to get wordy but overall this book is beautiful and dark and an enjoyable read.
4,The First Step,"When I was eight or nine, my aunt sat me down and handed me this book, proudly telling me, ""You know, this is far better than those Goosebumps you burn through."" At the time, Louie's narration was a bit too wistful and slow for me. (Or maybe Daniel just couldn't keep up with him) So, lucky me, they made a movie version. After watching it, I fell in love with the Vampire Chronicles wholly and utterly.Years later, I picked up Interview again (this was after reading the rest of the chronicles mind you), determined to try and dissect Louie's state of being and Claudia's Master and Servant dynamic she shared with him.What I found in lieu of my query, was actually this:I was missing the point altogether. Yes, the book follows Louis, Lestat, Claudia, Armand, Santiago, etc. But really, it follows the changes they are observing in the world itself.The vampires themselves are just part of a subplot.And honestly, the big picture is a lot better than a thumbnail, don't you think?"
5,an excellant novel of gothic splendor...,"first and foremost,id like to state that i've read this wonderful novel three times and every time i read it i only unterstand it all the more. for those who are interested in a dark, gothic tale of love, lost, and despair, I highly recomend this novel. the protagnost, Louis tells the story of his life and his transformation to eternal darkness. its very dark and as you are drawn into the despair of Louis's unlife. this is not a typical tale of a vampire, for your are seeing through the eyes of the vampire himself, not a mortal.anne rice as an excellant ability to invoke dark moods and creating lush sceens filled with detail.the novel is strangely poetic, which all the more makes it unique."
5,GREAT BOOK,Unlike Bram Stokers Dracula you have characters you can realy enjoy and get into and this book is very hard to put down I spent a whole week reading the vampire chronicles but this is my favorite.
3,Interview with the Vampire,The book is very slow moving. Not as exciting as other vampire books I have read. But I am finishing it.
1,"If only there was a ""no stars"" rating...","I consider myself well-read, with wide-ranging tastes in books. There have only been two books in my life that I absolutely could not finish, no matter how hard I tried. This is one of them. It is, by turns: insipid, long-winded and breathtakingly boring. I'm not a good enough critic to come up with phrases to describe just how excruciatingly bad this book is. I'm not sure that I've come across a worse writer than Anne Rice. Please do yourself a favor -- pass this one by."
1,The worst book I ever read,"This is the worst book I ever read. I haven't seen the movie because it's probably just like the book. It's fine if you're into blood and gore. I'm not. Ms. Rice, in my opinion, is a no-account, hackneyed, and cliched writer. Don't waste your money on this book or its sequels. If you want to spend it on Dracula or The Space Vampires. I wouldn't read them. I'm not into vampires."
1,she doesn't have it right,Being a Vampyre myself I can assure you that this is nothing at all like it really is. Anne Rice knows nothing of the world of darkness!
1,unpleasant suprises,I know this book is about the undead but I didn't expect the carcasses would be in the book.....found several desicated dead bugs inside as well as a unusual photo I won't describe here. Also the book was not in good condition at all. Guess I'll just watch the DVD
1,"sorry not a dracula, interview w a vampire fan","i have to say i was honestly disappointed; being an avid reader of vampire novels and a lver of vampire-lore, i was expecting the ""great anne rice"" to be well, better. i dont know, i guess i just found the book rather boring and much of what was written didnt stick to true vampire-lore. not a fan of dracula either. guess i'm not into the famous ones. it too into the details of louisiana."
1,"""Guy-Shadow & Puffy Shirts Galore!""","In a word: AWFUL! Ann Rice has taken her love for penning overblown sexual fetishes (both hetero and homo-erotic) and single-handedly ruined the vampire as myth originally described the foul demon. Lestat's character was so lavishly overblown as to verge on the comical. Each scene in the book was more or less a wishful description of an orgiastic costum party. The film characters portrayed by Pitt and Cruise cemented the laughable image. Hissing clowns, rouged, guy-shadow, and puffy shirt wearing caricatures, floating and flying around, catch the books atmosphere remarkably well. It's not a vampire novel. It's thinly disguised, (if at all) poorly written porn. True vampire fiction this is not. Awful."
1,I hated reading this. It was a depressing experience about an existence of despair and lack of feeling.,"Louis felt attachments to Lestat then Claudia, even though he knew Claudia did not truly love him and had evil about her. After Claudia's death, he never felt for anyone again. I did not like the author's use of the words ""You see"" and ""For you see"". To me, it sounded feminine and did not sound natural coming from the male, Louis.Sexual content: not evaluated. Setting: U.S. and Europe. Copyright: 1976. Genre: paranormal fiction."
5,whoever thought neurotic vampires would be so interesting?!,"While I tend to prefer sci-fi to gothic horror, I received such an enthusiastic endorsement of this book that I went out and bought it. From the very start, when Louis demonstirates his inhumaness by lighting a cigarette too quickly to be seen, I was utterly enthralled by Rice's characters, lumanescent prose, and long view on history. It is as if you entered 19C New Orleans and then Europe with curious, anguished inhuman observers.This book is so good that it should be considered literature rather than potboiler gothic horror. If you get into it, the book can turn you inward, to question your human life, from the neurotic and existential agonies of these inhumans.Warmly recommended."
5,A classic,"This book is a classic! It sets the stage for the gothic night inhabited by Louis, Lestat, Armand and a host of others. The main character is a vampire by page 12, the rest of the book is how a moral man can cope with the price of his immortality. he is accompanied by Lestat, a rouge of a vampire, who has no moral qualms with his condition and cant understand why Louis hates his existance so. This sets the stage, embrace new found immortality or reclaim lost humanity..."
4,Interview With The Vampire Review,A story of a vampire's lifeI found this book to be very interesting. It is about the life of a vampire named Lestat. Most of the story takes place in New Orleans where Lestat first becomes a vampire and then starts his new lifestyle. He starts to do the things other vampires do like sleeping in a coffin and staying up all night but one thing he does that other vampires don't in that he feels for things. This is something that really effects him and the other vampires he associates with throughout the book. I would say that one theme in the book could be Love. Lestat falls in love with another vampire that he created named claudia who is a small orphan child. Overall I felt this was a great book and I highly recomend it.
3,GOOD AND BAD VAMPIRES,"SOMEWHAT FAMOUS VAMPIRE STORY SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE LEADING NOVELS ON VAMPIRES. THE STORY SEMS TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE INHABITED BY BLOOD-SUCKING IMMORTAL VAMPIRES WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE NOT VERY NICE PEOPLE, EXCEPT OF COURSE FOR THE HERO AND HIS FRIENDS. RATHER INTESTING TO SEE AN ALIEN WORLD CREATED IN THE MIDST OF OUR OWN"
4,.....alright,i like this book but it seems to drag on . and I'm the kinda person that needs a good book with lots of interesting parts to keep me reading...I alos like how they described vampires though this book is kinda like my bible
3,This is an original strory but a humdrum drug out reading.,I read this book and kept waiting for something to happen oh poor Louie by the end I was hoping the sun would rise on his annoying ass.
3,Not Anne Rice's Best,"Anne Rice is my favorite author. She makes characters come alive like no one else. However, this book is one of her worst works. Do not use this book to judge the talent of this woman. I am glad I read this book last in the Vampire Chronicals, because if I had read it first, I would not have continued reading and discovering her works. This is one of the only times I can honestly say, the movie is better than the book. Please, don't read this book and drop Anne Rice from your reading list. The rest of her books are incredible and more than worthy of your time."
2,hummm,I read this book before I saw the movie.I like the movie alot more it was much more fun. I thought that for the book was slow it did not keep me up at night.I love a book that can do that. There are other Anne Rice books that alot better like Queen of the Damned which is alot of fun.
2,Talk about over-rated...,"It's like a Soap Opera starring Vampires. I hoped for so much more after the rave reviews I've heard. Unless you are interested in television/Hollywood style predictable drama, I would highly recommend you to spend you time on some other literature... yawn."
3,Well to be honest...,"To be honest I couldn't finish this book but I didn't think it was extraordinarily bad. I just had other books that I wanted to read and didn't think I should waste time on this one. I am an Anne Rice fan, but this is just not one of her best in my opinion. Long, drawn out scenes such as the one at Theatre de Vampires just weren't written well enough to hold my summer vacation influenced attention."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book. The book starts off kind of slow, the quiete life then all of the sudden, bam! Louis's life is transformed. The book seems to pick up and drop speed at various times, but the last one hundred pages in the book are excellent! the characters change, and It leaves me hungry for more! it is not the best book I have ever read, but it is pretty high up there. Oh and I am rating this book by itself, I am not some vampire goth waiting down the street, I read all kinds of stuff. Please email me your comments"
5,For those of us who love to look around corners in fear!,"Louis adventures into the 20th century amazed me. I've always hungered for vampire books, and this one is the best! This book will satisfy almost anyone with an imagination and a love for being scared ( or at least looking behind corners when you take out the trash. )Louis and Lestat will make almost all women swoon and men to wish for such...shall we say ""pull""? If only...but that would mean...oh well, who cares?This book is the best!"
3,"Mediocre, but influential","Despite the overly dense descriptions and some irritating lead characters, this book is worth reading just to see how much it has influenced vampire stories and movies since it was written.Of Rice's Vampire Chronicles, this is the only decent book."
4,"SHUTUP, Louie!","Louie whines too much. Accept it, deal with it! Although Anne Rice is saying something about our moral ethics and all that... Louie just got on my nerves. It's Survival of the Fittest, guy, so either suck the blood or starve to death!Anyways, Claudia... sometimes she pissed me off. If she was really so unhappy about her childish form then she can commit suicide...Lestat... I love Lestat. I love his mischieviousness, his playfulness... I just love his whole character!! That is why I read the series... even Memnoch the Damned (<---steer clear of this one, guys.)And to the comment from the guy who says he's a Vampire... UH.. OOOOOOKAY. Can you tell us how it REALLY is?"
2,Goes on and on and on........,"I can only think of one word to describe this book : WORDY. I kinda liked the story; the suffering of Louis, Lestat's evilness, but the way the story just drags on in places totally ruined it all. If you are really thinking of reading this book i suggest you dont tire yourself and just watch the movie instead ."
3,This was a emotionaly provactive book.,This book was emotional in a sense that you would become attached Claudia the young Vampire. Its wordiness gives this book a good rating. It helps to make the imagination roam and one could become indulged in this book. Although Louis wines a lot an Lestat is actually telling him the truth on not knowing anything you run into incidents where you question the validity of the two. Never had I read a book of Vampires that seems so real. This is a well written book and well worth your time.
2,BORING AND UNUSEFUL BOOK!,I WAS SO DISSAPOINTED AFTER I READ BOOK BECUZ IT WAS BORING AND WASTED MY TIME.WHICH WAS TO TELL ME NONSENSE OF VAMPIRE BEING USED IN THAT BOOK SO I WOULDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK.
1,Don't read this book!!!,I received this book as a Christmas present and was excited to read it. I did not like the way it made me feel while I read it and my wife thought I was acting strangely during that two week period. I had no religious convictions at the time of reading but still felt that it was inspired by evil and it still leaves me with a sick feeling in my stomach. I will read no more of Anne Rice's novels as result and recommend against reading her work.
3,"charming, but a partial failure","Why does good seem so dull and boring in this book? Why does evil seem sympathetic?I think that all of this went beyond Miss Rice's intents. Perhaps she really thought that Louis was the good boy and Lestat the villain.Have you ever seen a villain weeping for his own kuller? Or desperately crying for his creatures' love?Louis is an unbearable, unpleasant character. Claudia is a real monster (remember the way she kills the poor vampire-musician). Armand is an hypocrite. So, who can you save...Lestat!"
3,Whiny and Depressing,"This is my LEAST favorite of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. I know many people love it, but as much as I love the other books, this one remains a chore for me to read. I gave it 3 stars because the plot is interesting and I like Anne Rice's prose. However, the main character, Louis, is just pathetic in this book. The entire book is Louis bitching and moaning and whining. Lestat did this. Lestat did that. Lestat didn't know anything. Boofreakinhoo already.My favorite of The Vampire Chronicles is the sequel, The Vampire Lestat. Lestat is an infinitely more complex, charismatic, interesting, and optimistic character than Louis, and his story is much more entertaining. Lestat left me wanting more. Louis made me want to shoot myself. Although, to be fair to Louis' character, he became much more tolerable by the end of The Vampire Lestat."
5,Deservedly A Classic,Anne Rice exhibits a sure hand on the tiller and a clarity of voice that is classic indeed. A must read for those just getting into the Vampire legend.
2,Not as good as the movie would make you think...,"The movie is probably better than the book in this case, because Rice's writing style is very flat - almost like reading a screenplay. Her storytelling ability is good but she doesn't really have a writing style to go along with it. Not really recommended."
2,"Dissapointing, Really","I did not come very far with this book, and though I rarely do this, I gave up reading it. PERHAPS it gets better later, but the first third is rather slow and boring. This seems one of the rare cases were the film is better than the book."
3,It was Ok -- Not Great,"I had high expectations of this book, as it is touted by many to be a 'classic'. Certainly not your everyday, garden-variety read, but I was disappointed with the experience. The bottom line is that the book isn't very scary, and that's what I was looking for. Rice simply didn't do a good job of creating tension in the plot, which for the most part, just plodded on and on and on....Unlike other reviewers, I did come to like Louis at the end as he seemed to have grown past the incessant desire to whine about virtually everything. I'm not sure why Claudia was inserted into the book but her character really didn't add much depth. Not as much as it could have, for sure.In short, this is an interesting book but not a classic in my opinion."
5,Anne Rice is a master of fiction!,"I don't believe I have ever read a better book. You will be pulled into the world of Louis and his life after being born into Darkness. Lestat, as always, is Anne Rice's unlikely hero and is brought to life like no other character within the pages. Louis is a dark-angel, everyone he meets falling in love with him. It is not only a peek into the world of a vampire, but a glimpse at human nature. I could not recommend a book more hightly. I simply suggest that you continue to read the ""Vampire Chronicles,"" they will tear down the walls of reality."
4,A book of realistic logic,"This book unlike other vampire books, makes sence. Just think about living forever, wouldn't it simply get boring? Wouldn't you get sick of the killing? This book doesn't tell any great, incredible, story, it's just a realistic story of a vampire and his life, his experiences, his feelings. It's nothing special. But after reading it you understand why the author made it. To tell everyone, that maybe being a vampire isn't so wonderfull and fun after all. Neither is living forever. But you have to wonder, that maybe, if there were vampires today, wouldn't it be easier to live as a vampire today."
3,It is okay,"The novel was just okay. Nothing spectacular about it but then again nothing horrible about the novel either. It was very original and I gave her extra points for that, overall, give it a try, you might be dissapointed but I believe you will enter a new world of vampires, one that is fun to visit. So give it a try!!"
5,I'm hooked.,"This book is a beautifully written tale of the vampire named Louis. It talks about how he became a vampire and how he dealt with the issues of killing, serviving, love and loss, and looking for other vampires so that he can learn about what he has become. He has other conflicts because of his resentment of Lestat, the vampire that made him. There are other interesting vampire characters as well. It is a great story with some romantic settings in places like New Orleans and Paris."
5,Probably a new style.,"Someone may think that's a horror type story, but to be honest it's something different. It's a new style, probably deeper that horrors, which are suppose to cause fear. This book has the special climate, and after reading it, you'll probably: a) want more, b) won't touch another book in weeks, because you don't want to lose the atmosphere, c) you'll read the book 100 times... (don't ask where i know that from...) It causes many kinds of feelings, unlike other book i've recently read. I will never forget it... (and i'll probably read it for the 101st time ;) )"
4,Can't believe it took me this long to finally read this........,"Being as I'm a huge vampire fan, and I am planning to visit New Orleans for the first time next month, I decided to read this. I have to say, it was a bit of a hard read, mostly because of the way Louis speaks in his old-world mannerisms, and the third person point of view. I find it easier to read books from a first person point of view. Anyway, I made the mistake of renting the movie after reading the book (I saw the movie years and years ago when it came out) and the movie sucked - no pun intended! Left out so many details. Anne Rice is a great author and I'm going to read The Vampire Lestat next. 4 Stars on this one for the details and the writing."
4,Interview With a Vampire,"I found what I liked most about this book is Anne Rice's use of description and setting. She uses both to set the atmosphere and tone of this novel. The dark atmosphere and the ominous tone create a deep, underlying desperation within the characters. I've watched the movie and now read the book. I've enjoyed both."
5,Unique and interesting.,"I found that Interview With the Vampire was a very unique and interesting book. Anne Rice has an absolutely amazing way with words, the whole text is poetic and deep. Which can sometimes make things a little difficult to read, but absorbing none the less.I fell in love with the characters as usual, and even cried during one part. I absorbed every word and by the end of the book I was frustrated because I was not part of the romantic immortal world that Louis, Claudia and Lestat shared. This book sets the stage for many more to come."
4,shannon,"I really liked this book, it was just so fasinating the whole story was great, it made you feel like you were right there with them while they were experincing everything."
3,Vampires can be dramatic,"Even though Interview With The Vampire was not my favorite creepy story, I still encourage people who like emotional drama books to read it. I was dissapointed about Louis and I actually felt sorry for him. It gets boring when you read about people like Louis. The one thing that I liked about the book was how well the author describes New Orleans a couple of centuries ago."
3,Decent pulp fiction,"If you're looking for elegant writing, look elsewhere, but if what you want is a bizarre romance story, go ahead and give it a try. The writing is too flowery for my taste and the story somewhat slow, but it is a pop-culture phenomenon which is worth at least being familiar with."
2,"2 1/2 stars - eh, its ok","I liked how the vampires in this book differ from the traditional vampires (enhanced visual and auditory perception, do have reflections, can subsist on animals).The story was drawn out, and I did not enjoy the amount of pages devoted to Louis's (the main character) depression. I was disappointed with the ending, it just didnt strike me as all that great a story.I will try the original by Bram Stoker."
2,Disappointment!,I read the others before this and frankly was disappointed while i love lestat and armand i found this book a let down. Louis is a whiney annoyin weak character who has no guts. Claudia unfortunately had her life ruined due to a stupid act by lestat. So her character has turned into a spoiled brat.
4,A great Anne Rice classic!,Anne Rice has done it again! A particularly interesting piece of literature!
1,Mystery,"It still mystifies me why so many people have so high an opinion of this book. I personally found it unbearable. To call this a vampire novel would be the same as calling Casper a ghost story. Nothing more than pretentious, pseudo intellectual pink novel."
2,TOO DARK FOR ME,I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better. BOOK WAS OKAY
4,a little long winded-but oh so sensual and thought-provoking,"""Interview"" will put you through serious mental acrobatics if you let it. What is morality? Is there a fixed moral code? Were the vampires human enough to be subject to humanity and therefore certain standards? What makes us human? Also, it's a damn good read, although Anne Rice does tend to run on. There is some seriously beautiful/repulsive imagery. I loved this novel for the way it presented such great ""life on the other side"" questions about being human in such a user-friendly package."
3,eh...,"This book is okay. The thing that redeems it is that Anne Rice thought of a topic that hadn't really been explored as of the writing of this book. The dialogue and banal philosophizing are boring and insipid, but Claudia was entertaining... The book should really be about Claudia.. Let's dump Louie and his constant whining."
5,"Fantastic, but ignore the movie!","I read Interview about 13 years ago when almost no one had heard of Anne. The idea was unique, the story development compelling, and character development brillant. If you can ignore the build-up around the vampire series and especially the movie, and imagine the characters and settings independent of the hype than this book is simply brillant."
5,My son absolutely loved this book,"I haven't seen my 4th grader delve into a book with such gusto since he read the Fudge series by Judy Blume. I found this title on a list of humorous books which boys like, and it truly lived up to its reputation."
1,Non sense,"This book portrays my country as I expect it to be portrayed by a naive gringo who probably have never left his country and who doesn't even know where Katmandu is or wonders if there are gorillas in India...A sorry, boring and inexact book"
2,K.I.S.S.,"The spirit is there along with a sound message and an abundance of info. But the author's flesh is much too willing. This book is about ten times longer than the message and the material justify. Go to a bookstore, browse it selectively for half an hour for free, and you'll have the best of it. What is sustainable about books that are too long? KISS = Keep It Short and Simple!!"
3,Wishful Thinking,"The author goes to great lengths to demonstrate that, when natural capital is included in the calculation, capitalism can be made docile. Capitalists are disinclined to follow this more ethical course without guns pressed to their temples, however. Corporations are mandated by Supreme Court decisions to put return on investment before any other consideration, meaning they are prohibited from acting ethically if profits might be compromised. This sociopathic perspective means corporations must ""externalize"" whatever costs they can, environmental costs being the easiest. ""Free market democracy"" (as used by neocons) means we must eat the soot and drink the effluent of industry."
4,Great book,I liked the book because it is so well-written and so comprehensive. It is rare that you find a book that is a good read and still loaded with technical How-To. How do I know the book is well-written... I know because I find myself having trouble putting it down. I enjoy just reading it.The forward says it all. I too wish this book had existed about ten years ago. I could have really used it. I too think it reads like an experienced developer sharing his experiences. These are words of wisdom from someone who has been there.This is a great book. If you work with Sql Server you will learn something useful from this book. You will probably also find some scripts or procedures that you can use in your own work.
5,A programmer's book,"This book is just what a programmer would want. No fluff, just the deep technical stuff. I loved the coverage of design patterns, the chapter on version control and source code management with tsql and query analyzer. The essays at the end of the book are the best I've seen in a technical book. Henderson should look into doing a novel. Bottom line - great technical info and great writing = a book that's hard to beat."
5,Get your XML here!,"This book was all I could have asked for. I have been wanting to learn about XML in SQL Server for a long time. I read the Books Online, but just couldn't really get it. I mean I could write the code and I could play with OPENXML, but I didn't really *understand* what I was doing. This book changed all that. Now it all makes sense. Unlike a lot of other books, it doesn't repeat the online docs. It starts where the Books Online ends. And the sample code is really useful. The book says there are over 700 example files and I don't doubt it! The sheer number and the quality of the samples makes the book worth the price all by itself."
5,"Information, tips and knowledge","This is one of the few books that explore T-SQL. It was written for SQL Server 2000, so some of the tips and techniques are dated.As a DBA I am always looking for a better, easier way to write code. This book is full of examples.I hope that Ken updates his series for the new version of SQL Server."
5,Worth the price for the XML goodies alone,"Henderson writes in a style that is refreshingly clear. I found the book very easy to follow. The stored procedure discussions are the best I've found anywhere. The book really delivers by getting into every facet of Sql Server. The best part are the XML discussions. The intro on XML is better than any I've found elsewhere. The subsequent chapters on SQL XML are easy to read, nitpickingly detailed, and very deep. I would have paid the price I did to get the SQL XML goodies alone."
5,Sample code alone is worth 10x the price,"With over 700 code samples, this book is literally loaded with good stuff. The SQL XML example code (especially sp_run_xml_proc) alone is worth the cost of the book. The code is top notch and explained by a master. I'm an old programmer at heart, so I love this stuff. I've never seen someone pull off being so code-centric but so in-depth with the explanations and advice. You can definitely tell the author ""has been there."" That's why he writes stuff like sp_run_xml_proc, ingenious in its simplicity, infinitely useful -- like most of the code in the book. If you want a coder's take on SQL XML, .NET, xprocs, OLE Automation, and, above all, Tsql Stored Procedure programming, this is the book for you.TJDP.S. I just bought his other book, The Guru's Guide to Tsql, and it looks just as good!"
2,Fundamentally flawed,"This book is the guru's guide to transact-sql, second editon. It's fundamentally the same book with cursory and very beginner level XML chapters added. This is that same old collection of magazine tricks and command line stuff that's been left behind by the majority of professionals. This would be good if you are only interested in t-sql tricks to impress your friends. Loaded with obvious axioms in computer science and unusable code that is most often more dangerous and not wise to use at any time, than anything. [...]"
4,best book on VSS i've seen,I never got the hang of Visual sourcesafe until this book. Thank you for writing a book on this obscure topic. The other stuff in the book is outdated or just fiddle type stuff.But with this book you can document your query and everything ni VSS. Buy it just for VSS. That's all that' really good in it.
5,The only SQL book I regularly use,"I have a lot of different SQL books. This is the only one I regularly turn to. It is chalk full of useful info, and you should read if you want to program professionally with Sql Server."
4,Roar Hard Rock,"Tiger B Smith released 2 Albums in the early 70s. ""Tiger Rock"" and this one. Tiger Bunch is by far the better of the two. The music at times reminded me of Classic era Uriah Heep and small touches of Motorhead. Favourite tracks are ""Help for a Blind Man"" and ""Disappointed Love"". The latter would have sounded great at a Large concert hall with an audience sing-along. ""Little Miss Anna Sheffield"" has some really amusing lyrics in it eg. ""She fell in love with a stranger, but God she's got an ugly face"".I didnt find any weak tracks on this CD, and recently recorded on German Satellite a 10 Hour tribute to Kraut Rock. It had a couple of vintage promos of TBS, and although it was a thrill, they can't mime to save their lives, and at the same time, looked lifeless. God knows what they were like in concert."
2,Worth the paper it's printed on but no more,"I used this book in a 400 level college course on software engineering, and found it to be exceedingly shallow in its coverage of the topic. The work is a worthy attempt at providing a broad overview of the discipline. However, in my estimate it covers too much material in too little space and presents too few practical examples of the type that might be applicable to a ""real-world"" software project. Further the text only gives lip service to the wide array of tools now available. In all honesty I don't see how any one could give this book more than three starts (apologies to the other reviewers), especially considering that the book is now in its sixth edition.I was at the used book store recently and had the good fortune of acquiring Stephen R. Schach's excellent book: ""Software Engineering with Java."" If you are a college professor looking for a course text, I would highly recommend taking a look at this book."
3,most definitely a textbook,"This book is an encyclopedic volume of knowledge about Software Engineering, and proceeds from the beginning of the process to the end, with tangents being in the last few chapters. It has the feel of a textbook, with exercises and Key Points at the end of each chapter.That said, it isn't very entertaining and if it hadn't been my course book, I would have chosen a different Software Engineering text. This book is a great supplemental reference to get more detailed information. I keep it on my shelf at work as a handy reference."
4,Thorough description of the software development life cycle,"I read this book as a text book for an Introduction to Software Engineering course. The book starts with the planning and requirements stages of software development and progresses through develop, test, and implementation. Terms, processes, and procedures are described. A thorough introduction for a new engineer, or an overview of current trends and buzzwords for seasoned professionals."
2,Informative but not Practical,"I used this book for an introductory course on software engineering. Although the book gives an expansive view of the field, there isn't enough detail or in-depth examples to make it anything more than an academic treatise. I don't feel that I could use much of what I've learned in an actual project - I would have to resort to more specific references.Now, the premise of having an entire book on software engineering may be more to blame than the clarity or presentation of the material. But software engineering is a practical field, and a software engineering text that doesn't provide practical information isn't useful. For this reason, I cannot give the book a passing grade."
4,A classic,A book about software engineering without special focus on OOM. You want to become an software enginner. Then this book must be read.
2,a book without structure,"One expects one's textbooks to present material in a structured way. This book is all over the place. It is full of references to material ""covered in the next section"" or ""I explain this later in the book"". It is also full of incomplete sentences, spelling errors, and uncoordinated subjects and predicates. For failness' sake onó must admit that some useful information may be gleaned with some effort."
5,LOTS TO LEARN FROM THIS BOOK,I think one of the previous reviewers who gave 1 star is too picky about wordings and slammed the book based on just that. I have read this book and I know there are lots to learn from it. Just take a look at the table of content -- there are 29 chapters of software engineering stuff to digest.
4,Excellent Textbook,"As one of the previous reviewers said, it has broad coverage. But I think it's not that ""concise and clear"". Case studies are somehow trifling, and not easy to understand, because of the specific domain involved. Sometimes principles are not clearly identified. That's why I give it four stars. Mr. Sommerville is an English man and this book is not written in American English. Some readers might not get used to it. After all, it's worthy of spending money and time on this book."
2,Shallow and not using American English,"This book tries to cover way too much information in such a small space leaving topics overly vague and generic.Further, the author does not use American English, which is fine - when you don't attend an American university. Words such a ""modelling"" and general sentence structure makes the text distracting and confusing in ways it shouldn't be. If I am going to have trouble reading it, let it be the material and now how the material is presented.If the book isn't forced upon you by a university, you should consider a different software engineering book if you want details.Of course, I won't even go into my professor who is using this book - yikes."
1,A Horrible Book with Lots of Terminologies,"This is a horrible book with lots of un-popular terminologies and using abbreviated words, I believe that we can live with ""it is likely to"" instead of ""it is prone that"". Furthermore, lack of descriptive volcabulary, eg, ""inevitably"" had been used more than 10 times in just one single chapter, and countlessly in total."
1,Walk the walk...,"It would be good if the author were capable of following his own advice; his personal examples contradict themselves on many important points, and when the moral questions get tough, he (or she) dashes away like a frightened rabbit, metaphorically speaking. A quick Google search turns up several lawsuits and evidence that this author is definitely not someone who should be writing about IT ethics under any circumstances."
4,these guys deserve some love-,"Not much info on Amazon or anywhere else concerning this long-running power-pop-rock act (who if I remember correctly frequented the southeast), which is a shame. I guess you would call them journeymen, but that doesn't mean they didn't knock out some wonderful examples of the genre. This album has several terrific songs and none that are less than worth hearing. Check out ""All of Blue,"" ""Los Angeles is Falling,"" and especially ""Don't Talk to Me,"" which is a power-pop classic worthy of Marshall Crenshaw, the Spongetones, Bill Lloyd, Nick Lowe and the other masters."
1,Laura's Affair,I can only imagine that Laura Fraser had an affair with the publisher to get this piece of work printed. This poorly written tale of woe will leave the reader completely comprehending why this woman had no friends.
1,Wasted my time,"Truly a Sad tale writen by a woman whose husband left her for his true love, his high school sweet heart. (Judged by this book, he did the right thing.) Laura Fraser's ""Italian Affair"" is nothing special, and very uninteresting. Now Fraser's book rests in my Trash can on its way to the city dump. It is a boring story of a middle age woman who travel thorugh Italy alone. We all have similar experiences in Italy, but not all of us will be so available nor insensitive enough to write about these boring encounters. I know I will not read anything written by Laura Fraser ever again in the future. At least I gained this knowledge."
1,"You read the first 60 pages of this book, then you give up and donate it to Goodwill","Sorry, I just couldn't get through this book. The second person narrative was painful, and so was the plot. I rarely give up on a book, but this one ended up in the thrift store pile after about 60 pages."
2,Why did it take so long to finish this book?,Because it just wasn't that interesting. Yes the second-person style was irritating but ultimately I just didn't have any interest in wondering where this relationship was going. Nor did I have any interest in the author's healing process. In many parts of the book I sensed she was writing stuff just to get back at her ex. Why am I a part of this and how did this get published - I kept asking myself. But I did finish it - what can I say - insomnia and at 2 am I'm not that picky.
2,slow....,"I picked this book up as a weekend read as I am fascinated with anything concerning Italy. I guess I have been spoiled by other authors as I found this read to be rather dry and devoid of passion, which was unexpected. I was not convinced that either cared about the other and the way it was written was distracting. In places, I had a hard time figuring out just who was talking. By the ending all I could think of was 'so what'?"
2,yes and no,"Yes, it's a travel guide that gives the reader insights to places in Italy that are not on the usual tourist stops. Actually, it's easy to understand why. I liked that. But no, I couldn't get drawn into the intent of the author for her memoir to be seen as her recovery of self by having an affair with a Frenchman. She's also a little too easily flattered by the attentions of two Italian men she bumps into in Stromboli. This book has more the tinge of a college girl's traipse through Europe than a mature woman's escape to self-discovery."
4,Good medicine,"A great story of the richness of travel, love of life and truly enjoying who you are. Description of travel was worth it and the lessons learned invaluable!"
1,Please Warn the Publisher's Wife!,"The only character I like in this - I hesitate to use the word book, in this, let's say, piece of writing is the husband who had the good sense to divorce Ms. Fraser, fornicator ordinaire, adulterer sub-ordinaire. Go to Italy and have an affair with a shriveled Frenchman? A Parisian professor of aesthetics? Could you make a more limp choice among all the males available in Italy? (Note that irritating 2nd person usage.) Dear former husband, excellent choice that divorce -- although you must have had quite a draining year of marriage trying to fill the vast emotional pit of Ms Fraser.The self indulgent Fraser woman's poorly written observations about her ""recovery"" from divorce while swannning her way across Italy with other women's husbands is an insult to every abandoned, divorced woman trying to raise her children while her husband bops off with an emotionally arrogant Fraser clone.Ms Fraser's piece of print is not non-fiction. It is a piece of self delusion."
3,a waste of time,"the story is attractive, i could't put down the book until the ending. but after reading the ending, i had a feeling being cheated. the author tactically combined her divorce healing process with her seductive romance. these two things happened at the same time but not necessarily twined together. the disappearance of the romance and phone call to her ex-husband seem abrupt, irrelevant and not convincing. however she has succeeded because of the seductive book title and human beings' desire to peep into someone elses' private lives."
2,Worth reading if you're planning an Italian sojourn,"Part travel-log, part story of a woman and her relationships - one in particular - over a period of several years. Apparently at least based on fact, if not pure non-fiction. An unusual mix and style, but it works reasonably well. I read it because we were about to head off to Italy, so I was interested in the traveller's tales and experiences in Italy. Also includes holidays and short breaks in other parts of the world. As travel tales sometimes go, this is light and easy to read - but I doubt I would have chosen to read it if I hadn't been planning an Italian break."
3,"Nice travel book, but difficult memoir","Reader beware: this book is written in the second person. I found this HIGHLY ANNOYING. As a result, I cast the book aside for a few weeks before finally picking it up and finishing it. That said, I found her descriptions of her travels to be complete. In the end, I must admit, I found myself wondering what happened next in her life..."
1,I couldn't put this down....,"....because I was looking for a high spot from which to throw it! (Unfortunately, I borrowed it from a friend so I couldn't. At least it's not an embarrassment on my bookshelf).Two hundred and twenty-six pages of complete drivel. That's all you need to know."
4,Grazie Miss Fraser,"I loved reading about Italy and the other places she visited with the Professor. This book was a fun read. Laura's husband left her for another woman. Laura did something I would love to do after a breakup, she went to Europe to visit friends and did a lot of traveling by herself. [This book has given me the inspiration to one day soon travel to Italy by myself.] While visiting she met her Italian lover, Professor M. What an affair. The places they met in were too interesting. This is a good book to read if you are lonely for Italy. I was yearning for Italy after visiting last year in November, I came across this book and decided to read it to help me get through this period of yearning and it helped a lot, so theraputic for me. Signed, going back to Italy."
2,Narrative style annoying,"I found the narrative style (using you instead of I) so annoying that I didn't bother finishing the book. This author teaches magazine writing so surely she had a good reason for using this style. Any ideas on the reasoning? By the way, I have loaned this book to friends who loved it so maybe it is just me."
3,Entertaining Fluff,"Most fittingly I recently read this book on a flight from New York to Venice. As in flight entertainment it was enjoyable. The author's pain and vulnerability in the face of the collapse of her marriage is touching and honestly rendered, but I found the Professor not to be terribly appealing. The descriptions of various travel locales were wonderful, but the author's choosing to write the book in the second person was annoying and distracting."
4,A delightful summer escape,"Be sure to pack An Italian Affair in your suitcase this summer. I found the second-person, present tense voice a bit distracting at first, but I was quickly drawn into the story and stayed up late on a camping trip, reading by flashlight. Laura keeps the focus on the magical places the lovers visit and their feelings, not on the sex. Laura, although self-deprecating, has an inner strength and pride, and her lover at times displays a surprising wisdom about life. A quick, uplifting read. Enjoy this book with a good glass of wine, wherever your travels take you this summer!"
3,Liked it,"While I liked the story itself (light, easy, didn't make me think too deeply, perfect for the beach) and am glad I read it (heck, I could have written it!), by page 30, I got annoyed by Ms. Fraser's use of the second person singluar. You go for a walk...you kiss him... you watch the island disappear. It disturbed my reading experience, because I had flashes of ""no, not me, YOU, Laura Fraser, YOU walked to the harbor, YOU kissed him""! Other than that, perfectly enjoyable book - I really identified with the writer many times, and enjoyed some of her insights into how we, women, universally think."
5,Wonderful for a book group!,"My book group read this scrumptious book and had a dinner featuring the foods the author mentions--luscious tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and olive oil, pasta with capers and cherry tomatoes, arugula salad. It was one of hte most delicious reads of my life--and one of the best reads! I recommend it heartily, with a nice Italian Barolo."
3,Good Sophmore album......,"This is a far cry from the first classic,but there are a couple of songs that will still get you on the floor.If you are looking for a descent follow up album,this is the one.It will take you back to your high school days,especially if you are old like me!!! Anyway,hope you enjoy Rob Base,and Dj Ez Rock..Rock...Rock!!!"
5,Very cute Set!,I love this set as much as anyone [...]. Wonderful and very cute animals. Lots of tiny pieces so this one is not for children who still put objects into their mouth! Love it!
5,Never Boring,"The best thing about this album is that nothing sounds the same. Everything has its own distinct sound, yet you can still tell that its The Honorary Title. Its a slower album, so its very mellowing. I give it a 5 star because of any album ive heard in recent memory, it has the broadest range of tone and style. The sound changes drastically from a happier rock/pop sound with ""Frame by Frame"", to very emo with ""Everything I Once Had"", and then to a country twang with ""Points Underneath"". All in all, ive found this to be one of my favorite albums of all time."
1,Awful,"Surely there is a law against prose like:'It's a Finnish hunting knife, which you think is pretty appropriate since you've used it to finish him off.'About a year ago I read an article in which I discovered that Iain Banks spends nine months of every year haring around Scotland and having a great time, then uses the remaining three months to write a book. As you would expect, a writer who produces novels as a filler between long periods of hedonistic gallavanting is unlikely to output anything of quality. Hence: Complicity.It's difficult to convey in this space the awfulness of Banks' prose, the vacuousness of his ideas, the masturbatory content. The book reads like a cross between FHM and a supermarket mystery novel. Avoid."
2,Uggh...,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Banks' sci-fi work. I'm as big a fan as they come, and his sci fi is as good as it gets. The characterization, desciptions, plot, action, dialogue, all of it is outstanding. Imagine my surprise and dismay, then, to find that this book seems to have been written by someone else. Sure, the dark tone is there, but the character is unsympathetic, the plot is mush, and the setting is tepid. Maybe I've been spoiled by his over the top space opera, but this was a total waste of time. You may disagree..."
3,"Well, I liked it better than Wasp Factory.","After reading Complicity I believe that I am a big old softie-- I want some redemption in my novels, some hope of joy. Banks denies that desire, almost denies the possibility of hope.Wasp Factory_was so grotty that I just plain old could hardly read it, and I did not have that problem with Complicity. Banks is a wonderfully talented writer, and his portrait of the twitchy burnt-out Colley deserves all the praise that it has received.I am less enamored of the switches in time and voice, particularly in the last third of the novel I found it to become increasingly intrusive and distracting.I suspect that I would not have given this book five stars even with a more uplifting tone, but it most certainly deserves four on the quality of the writing. I gave it three stars because I am plain old unable to stomach such bleak and fatal compromise. Probably says more about me than it does about Banks."
5,too good for words!`,"hey there, all i want to say is well done, Iain! I can't wait until it comes out at the cinema! XXX"
3,"Murder, revenge, and narcissism","Cameron Colley just isn't a very likable person. He's got poor self-control, a drug and alcohol habit, a severe gaming addiction, facilitates adultery, and... he's a journalist to boot! And when he is confronted with a series of gruesome murders that seem to be happening when he has no alibi, life gets even more complicated.Author Iain Banks puts the reader ""inside"" Colley's head, and it's not a pretty picture. Colley seems always on the edge of taking himself out, and when he is driving, taking out a few innocents as well. He is not obviously suffering from a mental disorder (except perhaps narcissism), but the drinking and drugs are relentless.It was difficult to feel sorry for Colley in Complicity, and this lack of empathy affected my interest in his life. Banks continues to be explicit and detailed in his writing style."
4,Dig it,"pretty deep and dense for 300 pages. Quite a bit of moralising, but not too heavy-handed. Tidbits of plot are doled steadily with flashbacks used seamlessly. I just recently understood the 2nd person narrative of the serial killer. It didn't become apparent (obviously). Some said they figured the twist early: I didn't but I really enjoy waiting to see how the author is going to put it together. Excellent tone in writing and sense of place, history etc. Not as good as Wasp Factory, but really, how are you going to do that again?"
4,So good it makes me laugh,"As a resident of Edinburgh and a former student of Stirling university I have the pleasure of experiancing the settings in an intimate fashion. What I cannot fail to notice is the amazing clarity with which he describes these places. The ending does fall away and this is a general problem with his work, almost as if he was eager to finish and move onto the next idea.However in this incarnation of Iain Banks (the M being reserved to distinguish his sci fi self) it does not get much better. Read this last, please or you may not read the rest"
5,Fantastic,"This is possibly my favourite Banks book. Some people may think the violence gratuitous and if that sort of thing offends you then avoid this book! But I don't think most people would find anything offensive here and personally I found the violence quite entertaining. The plotline to this book is criticised by some here for being too obvious. This may or may not be the case, but there is always more that plot to enjoy in a Banks novel. For instance, The Crow Road's plot is drawn out across the whole, long book and at times it appears there isn't one at all, but the book is still totally absorbing. Banks's writing is engaging, witty and young and it is a breath of fresh air to read."
1,Midwest Collector,"I received this book as a gift. I have some hammered aluminum and thought this book would be useful to help me learn more. I was wrong, indeed! This book has decent pictures and that is all. There is absolutely no timeline for markings to help someone establish when a piece was made. There is no regard to what is 'rare'. There is also no information given on what the numbering system for certain makers means. How many types of things did Rodney Kent make, for example. I have found this book of little help with my collection."
1,Grist' book has received criticism from many collectors,"Grist' book has been the subject of much discussion among aluminum collectors and little of the comment has been favorable. Concerns have been raised regarding the organization and scholarship. I do not recommend this book, and would recommend Woodard's aluminum books as better and more thorough general guides which are also listed by Amazon."
1,More Harm Than Good,Virtually everything in the book is innacurate. There are literally hundreds of factual errors. A good example would be the 23 line essay on Wendell August Forge that has 14 errors of fact in those 23 lines. Shame on Grist!! Shame on Collector Books for having published it ! ! Anyone who has paid more than $1 for it has been significantly cheated.William Freeman
4,The future of Spirituality,"I must say this book gives anyone who reads it something to think about. It is the end all, be all of what real spiritual belief should be about. A different concept altogether than the spiritual place of our world at this time. I found specific parts of the book very helpful for my search for answers during this difficult part of my life, but honestly, would have to say that living it is very very difficult at this time with the condition of the world around us. I believe it's theory is accurate and the answer to our worldly problems, but how you get there is another story. I ended the book scratching my head thinking, how can I do or live this?"
3,Kid-friendly?,"My almost 10-year-old specifically asked for this book. I'm looking for a somewhat detailed read on the Beatles for him that doesn't necessarily emphasize or highlight drug use and such. I realize that's all part of it, but would prefer it not be glamorized or appear attractive to him after reading that his idols partook. Or on the flipside, I don't want his opinion of them to be jaded. I'd rather he remain innocent for a bit longer, if possible. Can anyone recommend a kid-friendly, comprehensive book?For a younger child new to the Fab Four, could this one be helpful?"
4,A worthwhile addition to your Beatles library,"As a fan of nearly 30 years, this was one of the first Beatles books I ever bought, and it remains a worthwhile buy for today's new fans. It may not be as detailed or as enlightening as the Mark Lewishon-type of books, but it benefits greatly from being written in the sixties - and having a firsthand access to the band. Hunter Davies includes many stories and insights that would simply not be available to today's writers - because they weren't there. The chapter that describes them writing 'With A Little Help From My Friends', for example, is as amusing as it is amazing. And I very much enjoyed the prologue, where Davies explains the difficulties he had with Queenie Epstein and Aunt Mimi. And his meeting with Pete Best in the mid-sixties is as poignant a scene as you will ever get in a Beatles book. It is stories like those that make the book worth buying."
4,A Marvelous Bio,"This book is the best bio I have read in years!! As a new Beatles fan, I learned so much, and got to know a lot of behind-the-scenes info!! If you're a true Beatles fan, buy this book NOW!!!!!"
3,Pie in the sky,"I was hoping this book would address psychological issues that drive us to overeat and offer suggestions to change. Instead it offered a very unrealistic lifestyle change of working only 6 to 8 hours a day, stopping every hour to examine one's feelings, taking an hour to exercise daily and an hour to do leisure activities daily. If only this were realistic....."
3,Not Impressed,"While this book did touch on all aspects of life - self-nurturing, healthy exercise, toxic foods, etc., and offered some handy info; it remains a diet book nonetheless. The author's idea of a 3-day plan is to supress or limit the amount and types of food consumed during the 3-day period - i.e., a ""diet."" While the foods on the plan are ""real"", the 3-day food plan is typical of Atkins, South Beach, etc. I found other books to be much more helpful resources to overcome the root cause of an eating disorder."

4,The History of oil,"If you are looking to get an overview of what the start and development of oil was, this the only book to put it in terms most people can understand."
5,Amaze,This book is the better form to say what means the oil in the world. The history is well clear end real. There are many important information and who is curious or needs to know the subject this is a perfect one.
2,"First to cover the topic, but still a facile book","Yergen gets kudos for being the first to cover this topic, but his account (perhaps because it's now outdated) is facile and pro-oil company. Every time the oil companies are thwarted he seems to blame straw men for it: tree huggers, the people that hounded poor misunderstood Tricky Dick Nixon, the Saudi sheiks (best friends of Bush, Cheney, et al). He never turns his gaze on the corruption of the oil companies themselves. We hit peak oil in the U.S. in the 1960s. The oil companies suppressed any attempts since then to find alternative fuels. Now we are up the creek, so to speak, with the Oil Men running the Show. Some ""Prize"". I'd say it's the booby prize. The best overview of our current fix is Lawrence Wright's The Looming Tower."
3,Fascinating read that will change your outlook of the Middle East,"Anyone who cannot remember the price of gasoline ever being below $2/gallon has probably lived in a time when the Middle East was always considered an area of immense wealth and power. It might be hard to imagine, but it was not that long ago when Middle East oil producing states were some of the poorest in the world. In fact, as late as WWII, the United States was the top oil producer in the world, which helped not only its own development but also single handedly helped the Allies win what was supposed to be the final world war. The history of oil and the impact it has had in the world in every way, from politics, to country conflicts, to corporate structures is profound. The Prize by Daniel Yergin is a comprehensive story of how oil became more than just a commodity, oil has and continues to change the course of civilization.My full review is located on my blog which is linked in the first comment below. Thank you"
3,Good History,"Daniel Yergin certainly writes well and has a good eye for a telling anecdote. This profile of the oil industry offers an important perspective on 20th century world history, and it highlights numerous entertaining characters. Although the book provides solid insights into the Middle East, it always presents a westernized (big oil company) perspective."
5,A Good History Book!,An excellent history of the oil industry. This book civers fron the first oil find until today. It well documents the impact that oil has had on the world in the past as well as today. The formation of some of the biggest industrial concerns in the history of the world a covered in this book as well. The author also explains the dominant role of the Middle East in the oil industry picture. This is a very informative and readable book even if it is long. This book is a good writing on a subject that is hard to write about. This book also does a good job describing the makeup and breakup of the Standard Oil Company. Be sure to read this book.
5,Understanding the world,This book is comprehensive and well written. It will give the reader a complete history of the development of the oil industry and how it has contributed to the shaping of world events. It is especially relevant to anyone seeking to understand what is happening in the Middle East
5,Puts it all in perspective,"Everyone with a true interest in understanding how oil has become the most important commodity in the world needs to pick up ""The Prize."" Having read it after Mark Kurlansky's ""Salt"", I am amazed that more than one material object has had such a profound effect on how the world has been shaped.I have very few criticisms. I would have liked to see maps of the world when oil was discovered and post-Desert Storm near the preface to give me a better visual understanding of the changes in boundaries caused by claims of oil. It also would have been nice to have a glossary of important names that when beyond just their current or last title."
4,"Informative, interesting and enjoyable (if you are into oil)","Whether you like this book depends on whether you already have an interest in oil. As an energy analyst, I find the book engrossing, particularly its explanation of the role that oil played in many of the world's major conflicts over the past century. The author also provided backgrounds and highlights of the key personalities who played a role in the history of oil. This helped to make the book far more readable and entertaining than your average history book. However, there is one caveat: for readers who are not in the energy industry or already have prior interests in oil, the book may not prove as interesting."
3,biased history,"This book is biased on the side of the oil companies and USA, UK foreign policy while depicting leaders in the middle east as clowns. A thick book, but doesn't say much. Read William Engdahl's ""A Century of War"" for a more informative read."
2,Propaganda or lack of a moral stance,"Propaganda, no matter how couched in research is still propaganda. The author seems gung-ho on the archievements of ""the industry"" and its dominant actors and never expresses dismay at the wanton destruction it has and continues to perpetuate. Right from the premise, when he had reported on the greed which the inceptions of the industry created/fed upon, I found myself wishing he would take a moral stance and say something against what could only be disastrous for all in the long-term. But, alas, nothing there, and yet, robber barons like Rockefeller were touted to no end. Goes to show you that Yergin is his industry's man."
4,Fun and interesting read,"Daniel Yergin has an interesting way of writing history and does it especially well for the travails of past oil entrepreneurs and tycoons. He couches the word oil in terms of ""the prize"" and places it as a commodity at the epicenter of the modern economy. He makes the case for the resource's growing power and influence in the modern world and leaves the reader to determine whether we are better or worse for it."
3,"Wonderful reference, but not easy reading.","Yergin is an excellent writer and his research is obviously extensive and exhaustive. This is an interesting book that gives insight into the development of oil, but I didn't find it to be very ""readable"". I wasn't drawn in and anxious to keep reading; instead I found it quite academic and a bit dry. That being said, it is a great reference for anyone interested in learning more about how oil came to occupy the place it does in our modern world."
4,One of the most interesting books I've read,"Documents the oil industry since the late 19th centure until the gulf war. Early history is gripping, paricularly the author's insights into the people. Less interesting towards the end as the author tends more to chronicle changes in oil prices."
5,Brings history to life and relates it all to Oil,I loved this book. I was amazed to see the tie-in of Oil to so much of 20th century history. The authors do a superb job of bringing the characters to life. I don't think I'll ever look at Standard service station sign the same way again.
4,The power of oil better understood,Most helpful in understanding the origins to the current influence of oil in world politics and economies.
4,Excellent and very thorough,"It too me forever to plough through lengthy work, but it is an excellent book that tells the interesting story of the evolution of the global oil industry. From Colonel Drake and the early oil barons, to the series of nationalizations that put this resource back in the hands of its rightful owners, the book read very well."
4,An excellent read,"This book has it all. You often forget you are reading a non-fiction book. Follow the oil industry though time two world wars and plenty of conflicts. Along the way you will meet a plethora of intersting characters, discover a world of intrigue, espionage and corruption all in the first hundred pages. The best part is it's all true."
3,A gift,Bought this for my husband. I don't believe he has read it yet. It's just sitting on a book shelf.
1,I Guess You Get it or You Don't...,".... and I don't. The first couple of songs are nice enough, but the rest of it is a disjointed and inaccessible mess. To their favor, no one can accuse them of selling out and losing their indie cred with an overproduced pop album, but there's a difference between being ""off center"" and ""way out there."" I know many folks go bananas for the Stone Roses, but I just don't see it. Were they an overlooked band who never got the recognition they deserved? Not really. They have their cult following, and that's all a band that focuses more on being cool than producing listenable songs can expect."
5,The epic Madchester release.,"This album (still use that term) will be 20 years old next month. One of the best British outputs ever. Almost fitting that they had the label dispute with Silvertone Records that they did. How do you follow that up?Revolver and Sgt. Peppers in the 60's, Skylarking from XTC and this one from the late 80's. Totally unique. Great artwork from Squire as well.A must listen for anyone, especially the under 30 crowd."
5,"It's not perfect, but it's VERY close","As all the five star reviews will tell you, this is quite an amazing CD. If you like jangly guitar pop rock, not the frustratingly simple pop rock of today but one that have layers of sound on it. You will love this album. There isn't a lot to complain about this album, it has very catchy guitar, well timed rhythm section and absolutely amazing vocal. There is one track you want to skip on this CD, and that's Don't Stop(and please skip?). The rest of the songs are masterpieces."
4,English Rock At Its Best,"I am at a loss of words on where to begin when reviewing this album. I definitely feel it's a great release from a band that unfortunately didn't stick around too long. It doesn't sound like anything that was being released in England at the time of the late 80's early 90's. This is great background album just let the music do the talking. Some highlights I enjoy are: ""I wanna be adored"", ""Fools Gold"" and ""Elephant Stone"". I can't imagine anyone really disliking this CD even if they have a just fleeting interest in Brit pop. I say if you are reading this review and do not own this CD you most likely have a geniune interest in the band and you shouldn't be leary about buying this release. I guarantee you will like it."
5,Guitar Magic,This album would be just another ho-hum 80's brit album if not for the amazing guitar work of Jon Squire. Just when each track begins to fall into a lulling drone Squire rescues it. This album is a three without Squire. With him it's a five. BUY IT!!!
5,an all time great,"This album meets all the criteria to be considered an all time great. it still sounds a fresh and original years after it was released and is unlike most current music. it was a cornerstone in launching a new musical movement - Madchester, it has influenced countless bands, Radiohead, Oasis and more or less every indie UK band.This Album has it all, great melodies, a interesting mix of songs from the bombastic and slighlty creepy ""I want to be adored"" , the beat driven rock of "" Elephant Stone"" , slightly goofy pop rock ""Bye Bye Badman"" and melodic hooks of "" She Bangs a Drum"".The Stone Rise could have been the next big thing but never reached their potential. They did produce one glorious album that will ensure their place in Music history and in the collections of music lovers."
5,Grows on you,"I had a similar experience to a previous reviewer. I was in England in 1989 and wrote down a list of the songs that I liked that were on the radio at the time. I went to the store and bought albums by the Lightning Seeds and the Stone Roses. I listened to both tapes on my walkman and decided that the Stone Roses were too atmospheric. A year later my roommate said he wanted to buy the Stone Roses album. I handed him the tape, which I had only listened to once. From that point on, I heard the brilliance of the album. It is simply a fantastic record."
5,Manchester Soul,"It's difficult to express just how powerfully this album still reverberates. Not just in Manchester, where I first heard their spangly rhythms, and Ian Brown's narcissistic wail, but every where. The Roses were icons long before they disappeared to produce the long awaited and under rated Second Coming. And is there anyone who's heard the album who doesn't forget exactly what they're doing as soon as the the intro to Waterfall kicks in? They were a band for their time, for a moment, but it runs deeper than that. They were the Manchester scene. It's still impossible to imagine it without them. John Squire put their media shyness down to ""perpetuating the myth"". There was no need. The music made the myth. It still stands today."
3,kind of disappointing,"While by no means catastrophic, this album has been greatly over-rated since the start. One the one hand, their greatest song, which was from that era, Fool's Gold, is not from the original version of the album and has been only added on later versions. That song was and is fantastic and does correspond to exactly what the hype was about: the perfect fusion of dance with rock estaetics. However the rest of the album is not that great. While one can see that they are talented, the sound is musddy and the playing is sloppy. While these characteristics are what makes a hypnotic song like Fool's Gold great, the remainder of the songs which are more straightforward in structure do suffer. The next record was actually somewhat better since production values were superior but since the band had been so much over-hyped, survival was not posssible and they split. Also a group such as the Happy Mondays were abloe at their best to convey much more energy in their songs."
5,Founding Fathers of the '90s Brit Pop Explosion,"I became a fan of Oasis in 1994, a fan of Blur in 1995, a fan of Ocean Colour Scene in 1996....I DIDN'T GET TO THIS ALBUM UNTIL 2001!!! Well better late than never you know. This album is one of the most amazing British rock albums ever. The songs are flawless, the production is flawless, the musicianship etc., etc., etc. It was like a version of ""Revolver"" for 1989. Every Brit pop-rock band that came after these guys sites the Stone Roses as one of their primary influences....almost right next to or even surpassing the Beatles. Not since albums from the late 1960s had a track sequence sounded so invigorating and cohesive. This album belongs in anyone's collection who even skimps at British rock. It's a masterpiece from beginning to end!"
2,Stone Numb,"Typically offensive Brit-indie record. Arrogance rooted in Brit-art-pop school aristocratic nonsense. Sounded fairly epochal to bored middle-classers and British music critics. Achieve appropriate balance of Brit-pop and acid-ecstasy vibes on ""Fool's Gold."""
3,Very overrated,"Amid the buzz of the late 80s Manchester ""Baggy"" scene,The Stone Roses looked just right and had just enough decent tunes for a massive British press hype, but the music on this record was otherwise frankly average. 60s psychedelia merged with 80s indie shoegazing (a very unorigional combination even at the time of release)heralded as genius. Had they come from another part of the world other than Manchester they probably would have dissappeared into obscurity. It seems that the group themselves had no idea why the public had got so excited about this album and so took 6 years before managing to release another. When the 2nd album was released the press hype machine had long gone elsewhere and so it bombed and they split up. Its not a bad record but its nothing special. Dont believe the hype."
2,Average at best,"Strangely flat and hollow-sounding, as if the band were an Disneyesque animatronic display created by semi-reptilian archaeologists from a planet 700 light years away who aren't quite sure what music is to demonstrate what they think what pop music might have sounded like on 20th-century Earth."
2,I Forgot it was on the Turntable,"I bought this when it originally came out on vinyl. I'm a big fan of catchy pop music and heard good things about it. I'm really baffled that people are giving this such great reviews. I tried listening to it many times and it just never got my attention. Once, I put it on and about 10 minutes later I found myself thinking, ""I should put some music on."" I forgot that it was on. Well, okay, the Thai Stick might have had something to do with it; but you know what I mean."
1,Blows Hardly Much,"From the opening track, ""I Want To Be A Dog"" to the blasphemous finale - ""I am an erection"", this album struts along the dandy-lions like butter dripping on lead.Absolute rubbish if I was being honest, I'd rather eat a can of worms than listen to this nonsense again. The 2nd track ""He who bangs the drums"" was awful, it reminded me of everything that was bad about the 80s: shiny guitars, reeling drums, and a singer who sounds like a cross between Ricky Steve and Bobby Carlton.Don't waste your time lads. Go and check out those heady early days when E.L.O. lit Lucy in the pie with diamonds. Spiffing! In a word."
5,Sublime Madchester all over the way.,"After 'Sgt.Pepper', 'Never mind the bo**ocks' and 'The Queen is dead', this is the best album that reminds me of a new era. Funky basslines, psyched-out guitars, JB-rhythms, what more do you want ? From start till end, absolutely massive !"
5,Unbelievable!,"Well, 27 reviews and counting, and all of them are dead-on right. This album absolutely RULES. Every song is fantastic, but just the full-on cosmic instrumental climax of ""I Am The Resurrection"" is worth much more than the price of admission.One little note, though: I bought the original British version of this on vinyl, which lacked the songs ""Elephant Stone"" and ""Fool's Gold."" (Those were released as singles in Britain.) I still think that the album is best *without* those songs in the lineup, even though I love those two songs. But ""I Am The Resurrection"" is definitely best as the awesome volcanic end of the album. I have ""Elephant"" and ""Fools"" on a separate CD of singles and rarities, and I think they fit better there. Just my two cents. Oh, and if you ever see ""Sally Cinnamon,"" ""Here It Comes,"" or ""Mersey Paradise"" anywhere, grab those songs! Awesome stuff!"
5,a fresh sound in rock -,"The Stone Roses are huge in England but not so well known in the US. To me, they have a more free and improvisational sound than most rock groups today. A few posters here even compare them to the Beatles - but I think that's a pointless exercise. If every rock band had to meet that standard (or felt they had to), nothing would be recorded. I can say they are not imitating anyone; they are rock originals."
1,very disappointing,"I should have taken heed per Alan Williamson. I'd heard this band could be like Led Zeppelin. I was hoping for something like that or maybe a Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam or Nirvana.If you're looking for the kind of music I've just referred to, the Stone Roses aren't going to do it for you."
1,Not good,When Mike & The Mechanics ushered in the `Madchester' scene with The Living Years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon. If you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads!Verdict: don't waste your money.
5,Simply the best,"Well, what can I say about this album that hasn't already been said?The first time I heard this album; within the first twenty seconds of the first track, I knew this was going to be something special, and I wasn't wrong. Every track on this album is pop perfection; why can't music be like this anyomore?If it wasn't for this album, there wouldn't have been oasis, ocean colour scene, the stereophonics, and just about every indie guitar band of the 90s!!!Has any album been so significant and influential? I doubt it, top marks from me!!!"
5,This album never grows old,"Good God I cannot explain how much this album means to me from the time I bought it when I was 14 to where I am now it never grows old rather just coils and fits like a piece of sunken sunshine. Seriously though this album will open up a whole new world for you not just musically but just how one can look at the world. Liquid 12-string guitar runs, funky bass lines, drums that sound off from a distance and vocals that hypnotize. The band appeals to both men and women, it doesn't matter who you are this piece of art sticks with you forever."
3,BOA 2000 9ft jump rope,"I loved this jump rope while it lasted. I'm a beginner so I didn't want a rope that was too fast. This one kept great speed, it was the perfect weight and didn't tangle. Only problem is the rope broke at the handle after only a couple of months. I'm hesitant to purchase another because its so much more costly than other ropes. I expected the rope to last a lot longer considering the price."
1,THIS STUFF SUCKS,"Im a guy that is a few shades darker than a normal fair skinned white boy and so i expected this stuff to work really well. After paying through the nose for 2 bottles and 1 day delivery of 60 bucks, i tried this over 4 days. After 4 days, i noticed no difference than if i were walking in the sun without sunscreen. A hint of brown.Id ask for my money back but hack companies like this probably wouldnt honor it.Do not buy. Its oily and nasty and you will sweat uncontrollably."
1,FAKE COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT,"REAL Maui Babe skin oil is wonderful and smells like brown sugar and coffee. I ordered this on Amazon and it smells like soy sauce and does not feel or protect like Maui Babe. This stuff is not sold by Maui Babe and I new I was taking a gamble ordering online. I am convinced this is fake, you never know when you buy though Amazon. I have seen this online and in-store at Ulta so I guess I will buy it there from now on."
5,maui babe,"Maui Babe - Browning Lotion - 4 o[[ASIN:B00076XR3O Maui Babe - Browning Lotion - 4 ozz found product all it did what it said it could do. love the product will reorder when i run out. have advised my friends to orderMaui Babe - Browning Lotion - 4 oz, 2 pack"
1,Buyer beware,"Recently on a vacation, I purchased a bottle of Maui babe browning lotion. While I was very impressed and very pleased with this bottle, I opted to order more from [...]. The lotion is not the same as the original bottle I bought. Although the bottle looked the same, the contents are not. I would suggest ordering directly from [...], its a little more expensive, but if you want the same thing, its best to order the original."
2,Not so much...,"I bought this on the Big Island at the beginning of my trip after reading the great positive reviews here. I wanted to make sure it was worth the $15! Maybe I got a bad batch, but I've been in the sun for several days at this point and all it seems to do is make me oily and smell like coffee. I have fair Norwegian skin that doesn't typically tan very well. This didn't help at all as far as I'm concerned - still blotchy and red, just like I always am after being in the sun. I used sunscreen underneath this as well, as recommended. Others claiming a similar complexion claimed it works great! Disappointing after all of the ""testimonials"" I read here."
3,Not the same as the islands!,"The product I received was unfortunately not of the same quality as the lovely Maui Babe lotion purchased on the islands. I'm not sure why there is a difference, the labeling appears to be the same, but it is definitely not the same product I bought in Hawaii. I was disappointed."
2,Not Original nor in Original Package,"Long Time Browning Lotion user, My bad for reading ALL the reviews. The 5 bottle I ordered in the 4oz size was a repackaged product. Not the same High Quality of Maui Babe's product. Does NOT come in a SEALED bottle so repackaging is happening here. Probably old and mixed up again.. I would not recommend any product that is re-packaged like this..BeWare..."
5,does what is says,I found this product while in maui. I love it! It makes your skin soft and turns your skin a deep dark brown.
5,Great Sunning Lotion,Love this stuff - makes my skin nice and brown and soft! Use to burn but not with this great lotion. Great price as well.
1,It is not the real thing,"Last year I bought Maui Babe directly from the manufacturer and I loved it. I decided to try [...] because the price was much cheaper.Well. I can tell you ,it is not the same product. First, the bottles were not sealed. Second,it does not smell like the real thing.Third,it immediately washes off when you go in the water. The real Maui Babe stays on your skin even after bathing, unless you take a shower with soap. This is a fake product! Next time ,I would rather pay more but get the real thing from [...]"
3,maui oooey,"i bought the product after seeing a friend with an amazing tan. I ordered it because it said the product was a lotion. I have an ""oil"" phobia, so lotion is the way to go for me.I shhok the product really well, as the directions say, I can even stand the coffee aroma it emanates, but it is almost totally slimy from ""light"" mineral oil!. I could not stand it on my skin long enough to see if I tanned as well as my friend.If you don't mind oil, you won't mind this product!"
1,FAKE MAUI BABE,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE REAL MAUI BABE BROWNING LOTION.I WISH I WOULD OF SPENT THE EXTRA FOUR DOLLARS A BOTTLE AND RECEVIED THE ORIGINAL.THE CONSISTENCY,SMELL,FEEL OF THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL.IVE BEEN USING THE ORIGINAL FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I LOVE IT. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AND WILL NEVER USE IT BECAUSE IT STINKS DOES NOT STAY ON SKIN AND HAS VERY LITTLE OIL IN IT."
2,Beware sizing is all wrong!!!!,"Sizing is all wrong with this one. I usually purchase all kinds of items made by this brand always in size ""S"" but this time I can barely put this shirt on even though the fabric is very elastic. The size ""S"" is too small, it seems to be made for a small kid. Otherwise is not bad I guess."
3,"My favorite undershirts, but not the best buy here.","You can't go wrong with Fruit of the Loom a-shirts - they're the most comfortable of the easily available & affordable undershirts out there.While you can rely on Amazon to have them, it's not really cost-effective to purchase them online - unless you have at least a passionate distaste for your neighborhood Arkansas-based retail giant..."
2,Not Sinclair's best but a good antithetical follow-up to Jimmie Higgins,"I admit that I'm still not done reading ""100% The Story of a Patriot"" but I've read enough to offer a few words of input on its value in the Sinclair oeuvre. This book is considered by critics to be the companion novel to Jimmie Higgins (1919) and acts like an antithetical drama to Higgins's proletarian Bildungsroman style (see Karsten Piep). The protagonist in this story is a luckless opportunist in the middle of the Red Scare who becomes embroiled in a plot by the D.A. to infiltrate and spy on an enclave of Socialists who have been wrongfully connected with a domestic bombing. In my opinion, it helps if you're already sympathetic to Sinclair's politics to appreciate or even, dare I say, be 'moved' by ""100%."""
4,An evocative voice from the sixties,"Sarah had come home from Paris to be a bridesmaid for her sister Louise. When they were young Sarah adored her sister, but her sister never seemed to be the least bit interested in her. The novel traces a year in their lives through Sarah's eyes. It is a book about growing up, learning about different kinds of people and most of all its about the institution of marriage as viewed by Sarah through Louise's marriage.Although this book has been around for 40 years it is still fresh and relevant today. People have always hidden who they are and what their true motives are.I have never read a Margaret Drabble book before, but I will definitely read more in future. I love her prose and her acute observations of people. Well worth a read!"
3,"Quick fulfillment, nice price","Satisfactory fulfillment. I haven't experienced the amazing results of the other reviewers, but the curative abilities of most suppliments are wishful thinking. Item only claims to help with cholesterol management."
3,religious,Was on a recommended reading list. Some of my friends liked it others didn't. I feel it is a book to read.
3,Ok poster.,"It was good for the price, being $4 but the picture looked like it was printed right off of someone's crappy printer. It's still a nice picture but the print quality could be better."
3,Scholarship geared to the traditional,"Brilliant scholar translates scripture, warning in the preface of its natural, multiple meanings. However, the resulting text does not give the flavor of alternate meanings he suggested would come. Very traditional result of what could have been a valuable tool for growth and healing."
3,Very Good & poor,"Good translation of the Syriac NT. The explanatory articles, comparative verses, and concordance are very good. Perfect binding left much to be desired. Book came damaged."
2,Shoddy quality,"An unbelievable number of typos. It looks like much of the text was scanned with OCR and never edited. Fortunately, this is mostly in the accompanying text.The New Testament text has errors also, though. ""John 1:10 When Jesus straightened himself up, he said to the woman, Where are they? did no henceforth do not sin again."" The end of verse 10 and most of verse 11 are simply gone.The verses are printed as separate verses, yet there are several places where the verses are run together. Very confusing.This came out in 2001 and the publisher hasn't cared enough to fix this. Have they not actually opened this book in the last decade. Without the errors this would be a good edition.If your looking for a translation for the Aramaic, look elsewhere."
4,Enjoying the Aramaic interpretation.,I am studying Islam and Gnosticism..............this is a must have for me.
5,All you need for physics for boards,"Huda, raphex and old questions are all you need. In that order. Even the fine print and tables in HUDA should be memorized."
5,Superb and essential for physics boards,"Using Huda as my primary source along with multiple years of Raphex questions and a single set of San Antonio review questions, I was able to do very well on the physics boards.I would strongly recommend purchasing this book as all the material it contains is HIGH yield on the physics boards. Well-organized, concise, and easy to read."
4,Slight correction,"There is a seperate chapter in radiation safety, however this information is also scattered throughout the text. I would have preferred for all the material to be stuck in one section. Other people may prefer differently, but I find it difficult to remember all the factoids and magic numbers. Maybe a compromise solution would be a quick index section at the end listing all the ""must know"" numbers and formulas."
4,"fantastic, a life-saver",This is all you need to pass the Physics ABR board exam. A life raft in a sea of despair!
3,ok offering of dance tunes,"Did not get the airplay like contemporaries of the new jack swing era, but still nice selections of dance tunes and R&B that go smooth."
3,The frangrance ...,"A co-worker has this fragrance and I immediately feel in love with it. However, when I received it, it was okay, not as I expected. I should have returned it, but, it's okay for that lazy Sunday afternoon."
4,Some peoples kids,"First and foremost like everyone has stated, this is not punk, its bluegrass. If you dont like bluegrass the chances of you liking this are slim to none. For the guy in Co. get hooked on phonics. that way the next time your at your local record store, you will be able to read the label that the record companies put those things. maybe next time you wont be ""stuck"" with anything as you put it."
2,Do they really think this is bluegrass?,"I am not a Green Day fan, nor did I buy this CD because of the group. I bought this CD because I thought it would be real Bluegrass music as I am accustomed to. To my chagrin this ain't bluegrass like I hear played here in the Ozarks! Perhaps I would label this music as folk, but I just can't call it bluegrass. The musicians seem to be be good at what they are doing so I rated this CD as 2 stars for the musicianship. As far as being what I call bluegrass this CD falls far short of the mark. My advise to anyone interested in this CD, is to listen to it before you buy it. If I had done so I would have one less CD to pawn off."
1,What an awful CD,"I'm not a big cover fan, and perticularly hate it when stores store this stuff under the name of the band they're covering. I bought this CD for my wife on accident, and now I'm stuck with it because it's been opened. If this band had any talent at all they could write their own songs and not copy other bands that know what they're doing. The sole purpose of these types of CDs (the String Quartet tribute to... is another one) is to trick you into buying them. Beware!"
2,"Rambling, poorly written text book.","I pity the poor students who are assigned to read this rambling, poorly written exposition on Jacksonian America circa 1825-50. Admittedly the book is packed with facts (many fascinating) depicting this period, but it is a difficult read because it sets forth conflicting data and rambles incessantly. This leaves the reader to do his own screening to separate out important information. What I also found disappointing is that the book fails to present an exposition on Jackson, the father of the modern Democratic party. Rather the book focuses on the political parties at the time (Democrats and Whigs) and their allegedly self-aggrandizing similarity. Pessen also devotes an inordinate amount of time arguing, non-persuasively, that America was and is not a classless society. I found the book a disappointment and cannot recommend it."
2,he hates jackson,"This book is by a ""new historian"" who hates andrew jackson. Pessen endeavors to psychoanalyze the citizenry and contradicts himself constantly while relying heavily on the observations/quotes of alexis de tocqueville. There is obviously a place for this materialistic take of jacksonianism and in that regard it is a more than thorough account. It is no coincidence Pessen chooses the $20 bill portrait for the cover of this book."
3,Sparks the imagination,"I liked the book. It's Alice In Wonderland meets the world of Quantum Physics. The book reminds me of the Mr Tompkins books by George Gamow that I enjoyed reading when I was very young which helped me to understand the basics of quantum physics and quantum mechanics.This book is entertaining, educational and sparks the imagination which inspires one to continue to study this subject. It covers such concepts as Planks constant, quarks, quantum tunneling, subatomic particles, and the uncertainty principle. A good read for people of all ages."
4,FUN CULTURAL CRITIQUE,"Massman and Rosser have written about a time much written about, yet A MATTER OF BETRAYAL is utterly original, continually surprising and sure to challenge your conception of what the past represents, and how memory and nostalgia alters what's nightmarish and painful. You have yet to read such a challenging story. The characters live large, perhaps larger than many of us did during that time, yet the canvas they paint on tells the story of the American dream gone awry, of an entire culture's devastated idealism. The skewed values of some of the characters embody much of what is wrong with our country. While entertaining, this book offers a glimpse of something gone horribly, grotesquely wrong; and it hints as to the terrible consequences with which we must all as humans deal."
2,daisy bali beads,The spacers did not look like bali spacers I have purchase in the past. Many of the spacers were not in good shape and sharp on the edges.
4,EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND,"I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS BOOK FOR A VERY LONG TIME. ALAS, YOU HAD IT, NOW I GOT IT. THIS ADDITION COMPLETED MY PRINCE COLLECTION OF THE GREAT SOUTHEASTERN RAILROADS.THE BOOK IS TYPICAL RICHARD E. PRINCE, GREAT DETAILED HISTORY AND PHOTOS FROM THE PAST. MR. PRINCE'S BOOKS ARE VERY HIGH QUALITY WITH GREAT PICTURES AND TEXT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT LOCOMOTIVES, EQUIPTMENT, AND DEPOTS. THESE BOOKS ARE ALSO INVALUABLE TO MODELER'S AND RAILROAD FANS, WHO RESEARCH VARIOUS AND ODD EQUIPTMENTTHAT VARIOUS RAILROAD USED TO MEET THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. ANY OF MR. PRINCE'S BOOKS WOULD BE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.."
4,And I'm not even a fan of ERB,"I've tried to read a few novels in this famous SF series, but I just could not finish most of the books that I started. I'm not sure if the fault is mine, or the author's.""The Mastermind of Mars"" is the exception to the above. Once I started reading I could not stop until the story was finished.Simply put, this is Golden Age high-quality space opera.Maybe I'll try again with the other books in the John Carter series.Highly recommended."
4,"""Jazz & Salsa lovers of music""","RCA Victor presents Ray Barretto & New World Spirit Band, to prove once and for all ""Jazz will survive"", with this new and innovative album featuring tunes of Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and John Coltrane. The latin flavor on this CD is simply wonderful, every track is a winner. Highly recommend this one of a kind for all Jazz and even Salsa lovers. As the late Duke Ellington would say - ""Music is our Mistress"", so sit back and enjoy...Portraits in Jazz and Clave!.Total Time: 57:49 on 9 Tracks/ RCA Victor - 74321 68452 2 (1999)"
2,too short a return time!,"I purchased this item for my daughter, for her upcoming baby shower, which was three weeks away. Unfortunately, the item did not fit her, she did not like the material ( nor did I..very cheap feeling, like polyester) and when I went to return the item, the seller had a one week return policy! So I am stuck with something I'll never use, and out over $50. to boot."
4,love it!,"also found on comcast on demand and love it! wish I could view more of the other discs...sorry but, I disagree with the other reviewer who said you need to know how to dance. I can't dance to save my life but, the moves are pretty simple/basic and keep your heartrate up-what could be better than that?! and it's fun! I will probably order this dvd set."
5,Fun!,"I have purchased many exercise videos (I'm talking well over 40) during the last several years. The ""Disco Abs"" set of videos are fun and I don't get bored because I mix and match them. I am an experienced exerciser and this is one of my favorite videos - I even ordered another copy of this for my sister as a gift. Cheryl starts out every part slowly so you can catch the steps which are not complicated. I have a video where the steps are so fast and complicated that I can't do them so I know what I am talking about when I say ""not complicated"". Remember that if some moves on any video are not for you, you can always march or run in place. The idea is to keep moving, and these videos will keep you moving! If you enjoy disco music and dancing, you will really like these."
1,Disco Abs Review,I was very unhappy with the product as I had to send it back the first time due to the DVD skipping. Then I recieved another one from the vendor and the sound cut out with eight minutes left. I like the DVD itself it is a good workout and you will lose weight but I will continue to watch it on TV rather than buy another one through Amazon. If you are going to purchase one do not purchase through Sarah's Music. The vendor was less than polite when I emailed the second time about the problem and wanted a refund.
1,"Poor Controller due to being ""Gently used"".","I purchased this controller a year ago and it worked, but it is also gentelly USED which was not clearly advertised.To the standards of the official PS2 controller, this ""Gently used"" microCon is sluggish and clumsy it only worked well during racing games or to give to a friend who YOU want to lose at video games. The buttons get stuck in and there is dirt in between the corners of the controller from odvious usage.This controller was nistolgic because as a child i owned 2 of the original madcatz microCon for ps2 and Xbox with my 1st ps2 and xbox systems.Poor Controller due to the fact that it is was ""Gently used"", but the one i owned for over 5 years works better then the used one brought on amazon.This controller only worked well upon taking it appart and washing the buttons and rubber with dish washing liquid and WD-40."
5,Best controller available,This controller is small enough that it fits into everyones hands. I play xbox in the shop and everyone that has used this controller keeps asking for it. I always use it when I play Halo and I do way better than when I play with a normal controller.
1,Missing controller,"The USPS had a problem getting it to me. The product showed up at my parents without a problem, but when they shipped it to me overseas, we...Apparently someone in the European Postal relays to get things to military bases decided that they needed one. Broke open a box containing the pad and another item, took the pad out it's box (which was unopened) and then retaped the whole thing and sent it off sans control pad.This isn't your fault in anyway but if there is any extra pressure you can put on the Postal Service to investigate these problems would be appreciated. It's been a real problem for the last 6 months for servicemembers overseas.Otherwise, I'll look forward to future transactions and will make sure I insure every package."
2,Worked for awhile.....,"I bought this controller as a second controller and was fairly satisfied with it. Then, after about a year, the left analog stick started getting stuck so that it was constantly turning. I never got the ""Macro"" thing to work at all, and it never would work with one of my games. Mostly I used my Dualshock2 controller and just used the Microcon for a second controller in 2 player games. Now, since it won't even work for that I'm going to buy a new Dualshock2 controller. And as for the smaller size, I never really cared about that since I'm used to the larger ones."
1,Definitely NOT a live album,"The reviewer from Norfolk is spot on. These are mainly recordings from Lanza's erratic Coca Cola Shows of 1951-52, all of which were studio-recorded with the applause thrown in for the dubious benefit of the radio audience. The joyous La Spagnola excepted, the CD contains no real highlights and, instead, many of the tenor's most untutored moments. Give this one (and all its many imitators) a wide berth."
2,"Fake ""Live""","Most of these recordings are not live but rather are mixed with fake applause. A real Lanza fan will recognize many of the tracks from his records/CDs. The disappointment was great when I received this as a gift -- thought it contained newly found bona fide live cuts -- only to discover that almost all of them are faked re-mixes of studio recordings. If you're going to buy a Lanza disc, pick another one."
1,BEWARE - poorly woven junk,"I bought these as gifts for christmas and the hand towels started coming unthreaded all around after ONE WASH. I figured I'd take my chances since some people had had this problem and some hadn't and I could just return it, but Amazon wanted about half the price I paid for these just to ship it back (I had bought several of these with matching bath towels and wash cloths). It looks like Martex is having a pretty long run of bad batches with these ones, best to stay away..."
5,the best cookbook on italian food you can buy!!!!,I love this book. Ive been to tuscsany and ate at many restaruants including vipore and this is the closest you can get to tuscan cuisine. I highly recommend buying this book for yourself and your friends.
2,Awesome Lyrics,"I had never heard of this team before, but I loved the wonderful lyrics! The music was a bit different than what I typically listen to, but definitely a good cd."
3,Good adult animated movie,"This movie isn't a ""classic animation movie"" like Bambi, but it is definitely a good adult-type animated movie. The songs are wonderful, although I can't find out how to get a soundtrack. I definitely would not suggest this movie to any young children, but young teens on up should get a lot out of this movie."
3,"Okay movie, Amazing music!!!","This movie is all right. Not as good as its predecessor, The Prince of Egypt, but not bad either. What stands out in this movie the most is the incredible music. Why do they not have a soundtrack out? I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Until then, I have to sit through this mediocre film to hear the beautiful songs."
2,A MAJOR Disapointment.,"The preview said ""from the filmmakers of 'The Prince of Egypt'"", so I was interested. But then I saw it. And while ""The Prince of Egypt"" was a masterpiece of animation, and as a pure movie as well, this is BAD! The songs are mediocre, the voice casting is mediocre, and the animation is only decent, while ""The Prince of Egypt"" is totally opposite. And don't get me wrong, Ben Affleck is a good actor, but........well, lets just say he should stick to live action. And never take on a singing role again! It's boring, too! The story line doesn't have enough action, and dwells too much on drama, and almost has nothing to do with God, except for a few mentionings of Him. This is too bad, since it is based on a Bible story. Maybe I'm comparing it too much with ""The Prince of Egypt"", but I stick to my review. Go rent that instead, and if you've already seen it a bunch of times, then see it again; anything's better than waisting your time with this !@#*."
4,Very good sequel,"Maybe because it wasn't released in theaters first, this movie is a little more open about naming and referring to God than Prince of Egypt was, which is a plus. The animation is just as excellent as the original, and the songs are wonderful. ""You Know Better"" is simply splendid, and must have been written by a person of faith. The changes in the movie from the Bible are relatively minor (Rachel is alive when Joseph is sold; Reuben's efforts to save Joseph are ignored; Joseph does not rise to be in charge of the jail). The one thing I really didn't like was when his brothers asked forgiveness for selling him, Joseph replied by asking their forgiveness for thinking himself a ""miracle child,"" instead of saying ""What you meant for evil, God meant for good."" However, that could be counted a minor point as well. Otherwise, quite true to the original story and very moving."
4,A wonderful story!,"I think one should keep in mind that most of these straight to video movies are for children and that the things we find lacking in them as adults are really not so important as what our children may think of them. My daughter loves this movie. She asks to see it just about every day and I believe it's because she is drawn to the magnificent artwork. It is a great Bible story retold in a form that children can enjoy. As for the presence of God, He certainly was there when Joseph finally realizes that all he has suffered was a part of His plan. He tells his brothers that the evil they did, God turned into good. The music is not as memorable as ""Prince of Egypt"" but the songs ""Better Than I"" and ""More Than You Take"" are really beautiful and support the story. The vocal talents of Jodi Benson (The Little Mermaid) add to the enjoyment. If the next Bible story from Dreamworks is as good as ""Joseph: King of Dreams"", I will be looking forward to it."
5,Joseph,I like this movie a lot. It does remind me of the Prince of Egypt. I think it's a well made animation movie. Children will enjoy it very much.
3,Movie: Not very Good Music: AWESOME!,"Joseph and his 12 brothers are one of my all time favorite Bible stories which was why I was so dissapointed in this rendition of the old-time story. I'm *really* dissapointed that they barely mentioned GOD in this. GOD plays a huge part in this story and it didn't feel right when they only mentioned him once.The music although was amazing! The one thing I'm upset about is I can't find the music CD. I don't think they even sell it. They should sell it.Anyway, it's totally up to you guys. Everyone has their likes and dislikes; so it's really no waste of money if someone you know or even you for that matter happens to love the movie.Try it out! :)"
4,"It's not _Prince Of Egypt_, but it's worth the money.","_Prince of Egypt_ is a hard act to follow, and _Joeseph_ suffers in comparison -- especially in the music department. That said, I still think _Joeseph_ is a fine film; well worth the time and money you'll put into it. If DreamWorks continues to produce these Biblical epics (and I hope they do) I'll continue to buy them up sight unseen."
3,Er...,"This was a good film, though it certainly does not approach its predecessor, Prince of Egypt. The songs are decent, and the animation is very good. The characterizations of the Egyptians are more developed than Genesis, but most of the Istraelites do not show even their Biblical individuality. I liked it, but if you really want a good Joseph movie for the kids, consider Joseph and the Amazing Techinicolor Dreamcoat first."
4,Lightweight safety hat,"This was rather difficult to assemble, but once done it seems to be a nice hard hat. I suppose there are better ones with padding, but this one qualifies you to walk through ""Hard had only"" areas."
4,Serves its purpose,I watched the video on how to put the headliner in and it was a snap once I saw it. The hat is a basic no frills safety hard hat and it serves it's purpose.
4,"Fine hard hat, works great, wish the front had a flat spot for logo","MSA Safety Works 818066 Hard Hat, WhiteI bought two of these and they work just fine. It would be very helpful if these hats had a flat spot molded on the front and/or sides to more easily receive custom logo stickers."
1,Designed wrong.,"The inner straps need to be snapped into this hard hat. Myself and 2 other guys tried to figure out how to get it to work and I have tried again sense thinking I must be overlooking something. To this day I still haven't figured it out and assumed the insert was put together wrong. Defective products should get zero stars, but you get the idea."
4,Old school at it's BEST!,"I seen these cats at an old school concert recently....They really did their thing. So much so, that I had to go online and cop their greatest hits album. Good trip down memory lane. Favorites: ""Freaks come out at Night"", ""Five minutes of Funk"", ""Friends"", and of course.......""One Love"".I'm ready to get my suede front, Green and white Stan Smiths, my name buckle, and some pen stripe Lee's. Anybody seen my money green sheepskin? My lumberjack is in the cleaners."
3,Worth a listen,"It is actually very good, I would still recommend Going for the blue album if you don't already own any of their cd's. Rikk and Steve's vocals are good here, Rikk even comes off sounding like Dee Dee Ramone. Songs are still ""PUNK"", and some have metal and even arena-rock leanings. The guitar solo at the end of ""Just Like Before"" with all it's echo nods to the epic rock characteristic of the late eighties. The production is good and raw, No big snares or synths. Some of these tracks sound like great bar songs. Get drunk and sing along,if you will. This album should only be for completing your collection. I wouldn't recommend ""O.C. CONFIDENTIAL"", though. That disk is just depressing."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"If you want to see Muay Thai training, fights, or even much of Malaipet, or Yod, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! If you want to see some sad faced, crying trainer for an hour and thirty minutes then here ya go. The guy who edited this DVD looks like he bought Adobe Premiere and a book from the library on how to use it. The little bit of the fights that are shown are constantly in slow motion, this guy must have discovered it and thought it's the coolest thing ever because he uses it every chance he gets and that's half the movie. He puts in stupid sound effects worse than a kung fu movie every time someone throws a punch or kick. There is nothing legendary about this dvd at all! They don't even show the last fight just pictures of it. Mal and Yod are being used for this clown to make a buck off of their names this DVD is garbage and a waste of money."
3,"Not great, but good","Look, nobody can do it as great as the Ramones but it's nice to know that they have secured a following in other bands. Some of these covers just suck but others do justice. She's a Sensation by D.I., Suzy is a Headbanger by L7 and We're a Happy Family by Bad Religion are standouts. There are also some other good ones that live up to the originals by the Groovie Ghoulies and Motorcycle Boy"
3,We accept you.,"This was the first Ramones tribute album every released. It featured a bunch of then unknown performers, with Mojo Nixon being the only artist here who had somewhat of a name at the time. A few of the groups here went on to gain minor recognition, most notably L7, Bad Religion and White Flag. This is a pretty mediocre CD. There a few good performances here, like D.I. and L7, but no great performances. There are also some terrible performances, like Pigmy Love Circus, Blast and (sad to say) Mojo Nixon. Most of the artists here give adequate performances, but none of them live up to the Ramones original versions of these songs. But at least they get points for being the first Ramones tribute album."
3,Original Ramones is better!,"To listen the original Ramones singing and playing is much better than listen another bands playing their songs.But is wonderful to see how the Ramones were influential for this bands. Ramones is THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!! Joey, HO HO HO ! I love you !!!"
2,"Racist, sexist; a difficult read for the modern reader.","When I read this book, I thought it was a satire of something that might have happened in 1970s London. I even sort of enjoyed it, though the treatment of Brenda and the racism in the book was jarring at times. Then I read the introduction. The best thing about this book is that years later, the author was slapped at an event by a female activist for his horrid portrayal of women in the book. For a man writing about a character who supposedly had sex with hundreds of white women and managed to get Brenda to sleep with him even after he let his friend try to rape her without interfering, this author seems to have neither respect for nor understanding of women."
4,up there with his 70's stuff,"Initially I dismissed this album, as I'm skeptical about JJ's newer material. But while this release fails to capture the earthy, analog grit of classics like Naturally and Troubador it is still well worth owning.Tunes like No Time and Lean On Me are vintage JJ. He also does a nice job of mixing genres on Lady Luck and Tijuana. End Of The Line, however, really makes the album - as Cale gets back to the raw precision that seems to have eluded his blues in recent decades..."
5,Mid-period sophistication,"In '94, this was my first exposure to JJ Cale, and I played it hundreds of times. I have since purchased quite a few of his earlier CDs. Though all his work seems fairly even and similar, I think this album has the greatest variety, the most sophisticated mixing of the ensemble players, and the most original and clever lyrics. The production mix is wonderfully layered and complex, yet somehow maintains the feel that it could have been recorded in a smoke filled garage. It has all the traditional sounds but steps outside of the reliance on blues and traditional themes."
4,Nice return album!,"This was the first recorded material J.J. Cale had released in some years at that time.Not his best effort, but one us J.J. Cale fans grasped with open arms.We J.J. Cale fans have been grooving to his material some 20 years at that time .I personally would have wanted more,but still had some fabulous recordings.This album is not up to his classics ""Naturally"" or ""5"" or ""Grasshopper"" or ""Really"" or ""Troubadour"" or ""Okie"" or ""8"" or ""Special Edition"".However, that same classic sound is woven throughout and makes it a worthwile purchase.Some food for thought-While browsing through an upscale record store,I asked to see what they had by J.J. Cale.The owner took me to the section and low and behold I had hit the jackpot-John Cale.As I explaned to the owner(who had a broad grin),this was the wrong artist.He smiled ,shook his head,and said,""In my 35 years in this business I have learned that people who buy J.J. Cale-keep their J.J. Cale.ENOUGH SAID!"
1,Not worth the money!,"We ordered these to have in time for All-State auditions. We received them in October and we were already ordering new mallets by December. These are the most poorly-made mallets we've ever purchased. For nearly $40, they should have lasted longer than 2 months."
2,Kind of a let-down,"I bought this toy to encourage my baby to crawl and it was pretty much a flop for that purpose because it won't roll on our carpet. It can move around on our wood floors, but it so clunky and heavy that it leaves scratches. The animal noises (especially the monkey) are pretty pathetic and the ""educational"" parts are weak at best. My daughter (who is now 2) has never played with it for more than 5 minutes at a time. It just isn't that exciting. The only good thing I have to say about it is that she's dropped & kicked it a number of times and it has held up without a hitch."
2,Most annoying toy ever,"This ball has a very annoying voice with no option for music only. I have the Vtech sit to stand walker with the same old woman voice, but at least it has a music option so I don't have to hear it. My 6month old son plays with it for a minute and move on, but the ball keeps going on and on. ""Row me!""""Push me!"" ""I'm giving it one more star because he likes the ladybug on top."
4,Fun,My son loves it! It keeps him occupied as he tries to figure out why the ball is singing and rolling away from him when he doesn't touch it! It quite heavy though and I wonder if it'll keep working it falls!
1,There are better toys out there,"This toy does not hold my daughter's interest. The sounds and limited songs are obnoxious. There are three animal sounds, 3 shape names, and 3 number names. The monkey doesn't even sound like a monkey! Contrary to the name, my daugther does not want to crawl after this ball. It only moves in a tiny circle so how is she supposed to crawl after it? Waste of money."
2,Not very good,"I had 2 of these things dumped on me, one was brand new and one was pre-used. At first, 7mo old thought it was fun and he would wriggle after it, but the thing is so ADD that it just kept going on without him touching anything, it would roll away from him as soon as he reached out to grab it, and once he gave up, it would roll back and hit him in the face. It would die down for a bit once he started playing with something else, and then go back to attacking him. He could never even touch the buttons. Both of them got stuck on one loop and I had two of these things rattling around in the toybox giggling, 20 minutes after my son got done playing with them - creepy!! These things are 100% annoying, pretty much bullied my baby, and stopped working after a few weeks of incredibly light play, because they never shut off."
4,Good Toy for the Money,This toy has a lot of fun things to push and the music and lights are great! My only complaint which is why this got 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wished the ball rolled a little bit more. It kind of just stays in one place and sways.
1,don't waste your money.,I bought this for my 4 month old because she loves music and toys that move and sing so in the beginning it was a wonderful toy she loved it. She loved it so much she learned to roll over to get to it. After a few weeks the toy started messing up and just kept skipping saying row....row....row....ro...r....row....row...ro... you get the point. So we returned it and got a new one since she enjoyed it so much thinking it was just a faulty toy.... nope this one did the exact same thing!!!!!! Don't waste your money. Its a shame this toy can't even work when the baby isn't even big enough to drop it to break it.
3,"Good, not great - worth the experiment","Our 7-month old has a pretty good time with the Move & Crawl --- she's not transfixed or obsessed with it, but she likes the noises and the flashing lights. More than anything she loves the little tags coming off the top. The ball seems to work well and is durable so far. Next purchase = a bunch of tags."
2,Poorly Designed,"This toy is colorful and gets babies' attention. However, it asks you to find animals, shapes, numbers, etc. and even I can't find the button it asks for before it's moved on to something else. Very overstimulating! My other big problem is that it's a ball and little kids learn to throw balls, but it's hard plastic and heavy! Nice idea, but I think the design could have been thought out a bit better!"
1,Sitting at the bottom of the toy bin,"This is among my son's least used toys in the house. The sounds are loud, and annoying. I would think it would move a little more and better than it did considering it's supposed to encourage crawling. My son was never really interested in it until he was about 10 months old and big enough to pick it up and throw it around."
3,Rock-n-Roll better for 9+ mths,"I bought this for my 6 mth old. Initially, he liked the lights and sounds,and did crawl after the ball but that only lasted a couple of days. Now he ignores it and plays with anything else in reach. I think he may enjoy this toy more once he understands what numbers and animals are."
3,"Did what it was supposed to, but baby not really interested","This did everything I expected it to, but my baby just wasn't that interested. Between this toy and another crawling incentive toy, I learned the best thing you can do is just encourage them to come to you and save your money. They'll crawl when they're ready."
1,Not a fun toy,"I wish I had read the other review before buying this for my son. I agree that the motion of the ball is horrible. It either barely moves or rolls in a weak circle. It has definitely not encouraged my son to crawl! The lights and sounds are pretty hard to understand, and overall, my son likes to play with the ball more when it's OFF!"
4,It gets their attention!,My 8 Month old grandson loves this. But he was sorta crawling and able to hold up his head and stop the toy before he got it. Not for very young children. The toy might come towards them and it is easy to stop but not for very young children. I would say at least 8 months old and maybe boys would prefer it. The educational part of toy could use some work like other reviewers have stated. But this is a fun toy that demands attention.
3,baby does not love,my baby does not love this although I am not sure why. it seems like it should/would but it just never holds her attention.
3,It's just a ball with buttons to our son,"We got this when our son was about 8 months old. He liked to hold it in place between his legs and turn it over and over in his lap. He has never once crawled after it. He would hold it hostage. He liked to try to bit the ladybug and spin it around and around. He's 18 months old now and still gets it out every few days to push the buttons and spin the ladybug. This ball is okay, but definitely not a favorite."
5,Fun!,Our daughter loves this toy! She gets such a kick out of it when it rolls around and sings on its own. This was a good purchase!!
2,Erratic,"My 8-month-old son found the erratic movement of the ball upsetting. He would reach for it and it would roll away only to quickly return and smack his legs. Finally, he just wanted to bat it away and be picked up. After several exposures to it, he would become upset any time we turned it on. The sounds go off on their own and don't seem to correspond to the child's actions. And the voice they chose was annoying. It repeats and goes off like the gum ball machines at malls. I returned it."
2,"We call it the ""Terror Ball""","We introduced this ball to our daughter at 6 months, and it scared the heck out of her. We've tested it recently, nine months, and she is still scared of it when turned on. When off, she enjoys playing with the tabs, and slapping the buttons.There is no clear correlation between what the ball says and which buttons are pressed. No real educational value, and a very annoying voice. This ball could have used a ""lights and motion; no sound"" mode."
1,don't waste your money,"This toy was a complete waste of money. it sounds like a good idea, but every time my daughter (6 months) reaches for the ball, and it rolls away from her, she turns her head and loses interest immediately - and balls, all sizes and kinds, are her favorite. when it bumps into her, she turns and looks at it as if to say, ""what the hell is that?"". it does not encourage her to crawl (she has been belly crawling for a month and is enticed by many other toys to do so) and frankly, it's annoying to listen to."
2,Boring Ball ~ Not Educational or Fun,"I purchased this ball when my daughter was four months old because it says that it promotes crawling. She looks at the ball, but doesn't have much interest in it at all. It rolls/wobbles in a circle and plays annoying sing-songy phrases. You can't decipher what it is saying when you press the number/animal buttons. As other reviewers have pointed out there is no promotion of cause and effect if the stimulus does not result in anything immediate. The only educational value (cause and effect) is that if she pushes it it makes noise and rolls around. However, it also does this on its own when some time has elapsed."
1,Broken After 4 Months,"This toy sounded creepy from the beginning, but now after just a few months of light use, it doesn't even work anymore. The toy ""skips"" like a scratched record in the same part of the same song every time it's turned on. And it never sounded realistic, soothing, or good in any way. The monkey sounds like rusty bed springs, and it takes a magic trick to get the bug to work. BAD TOY."
1,Not happy!,My children were not interested in this toy at all. Very boring. I'm sending it off to good will and not even putting it in the yard sale pile.
3,My 6 month old was not a big fan,"I wish my little guy liked this product more, but he just wasn't too into it. He could play with it for a 1-2 min and that is it. I'm not sure if it says much about the product. All kids are different though."
5,Super Cute!,"This toy is awesome, My daughter loves to watch it roll around, but it does not work so well on our thick high carpet. But in the kitchen on our hardwood it can get around!"
2,Not a fan...,"My husband and I packed this toy away soon after buying it. IT IS SO ANNOYING! The weird electronic animal sounds, odd versions of nursery rhymes, the creepy children giggling... Plus it would randomly start talking or moving around the rug, even if no one had touched it for hours. My son was pretty uninterested in this toy most of the time as well- it never really caught his attention, even though it annoyed the crap out of us."
1,Looks like fun but too repetitive,"Got his for my 6 month old son because he was so interested in motion but he liked anything that was moving -BUT this. Every time you turn it on it starts playing roll, roll, roll the ball to the tune of ""row, row , row your boat."" when you push a button it doesn't automatically react. It has to finish it's iterneraey of songs and noises before it says ""triangle"" or ""1"" or whatever. Then when it finally does say what the button is you pushed it will start over again with all of the other series of noises. My son never even played with it. I would get it out to see if he would eventually find interest and he is interested in other toys but not this one. It's hardly been played with and it's going on the fritz. After it goes through it's program it will eventually get stuck on playing the same thing over and over again and will not respond at all to any buttons... So it just sits on a shelf turned off. Total waste of money!"
3,Kind of Boring,My son received this toy when he was about 6 months old. He is now close to 1 year old and he's never been that interested in playing with this.
2,Problems with this toy,"I bought this toy for my 7 month old grandson, to encourage him to crawl. The ball moves by itself and I thought that would get him moving towards it, which it did. But once he got to the ball, since it moves itself, it frequently spun around and clobbered him in the head. This is a very hard and heavy toy, so a bang in the head can really hurt. Plus, I failed to consider that his 2 year old sister, while trying to help him, could really hurt him by dropping this ball on top of him. Lastly, the size of the ball is too big for a child this age to hold, which a crawling infant would be inclined to do once having moved to get it. Perhaps an older child would enjoy this product. For safety sake my daughter put this away quickly, which I think was a good idea under the circumstances, so I really have no idea as to the educational value of this toy. It certainly makes lots of sounds, but as it was considered a safety hazzard I can't really say what they all were meant for."
1,Don't waste your money - Poor quality,Within about a month of owning this toy the toy started having problems. I thought it was just a low battery but after I put new batteries in it still had issues. After having similar problems with other Vtech toys I will NEVER be buying a Vtech toy ever again.
2,Looks are deceiving,"After viewing several similar toys, I picked this one because I liked the different features and textures which I thought would grab my daughters attention. I might have bought it too late as she was already starting to crawl, but now when I turn it on, she'll look at it then crawl the other way. She has no interest in the blinking lights, the music or the motion."
4,versatile interactive toy,"I think that this toy is suitable for babies from about 4 months old and older toddlers because it can be played with in different ways. Babies will be amused by the sounds and lights when an adult presses the buttons and will learn to operate it themselves, teaching them about cause and effect. It also encourages older babies to crawl after it as it rolls. It will help toddlers learn about numbers and animals."
2,It doesn't sound! :,"It moves and crawls, ok, but it doesn't sound at all, it was really disappointing because it's really colorful and nice"
1,My babies hated it,"Both my kids hated this toy. In part, I think it scared them a little. Beyond that, it doesn't move as they have learned a ball should move, so it's very frustrating to them (understandably). My baby likes to roll little balls back and forth and seemed excited to do the same with this bigger ball. She immediately disliked the motion of this ball, as it moves in odd directions and doesn't let the baby ""steer""."
2,Eh...not that great,"I bought this for the same reason as a lot of the reviewers did- learning to crawl. Not so much. I bought this when my daughter was 6 months, she had no interest in this ball. When she did learn to crawl- this still didn't catch her eye. It does not roll on carpet very well so it just wears the motor out. My daughter does play with this a little now at 10 months but she gets bored after 3 mins of it. I wish I spent my money on something else."
4,learning toy,"so far our grand son really likes this to, he has just started crawling and he follows this toy all around the room."
2,Scares my daughter,"This toy scares the daylights out of my almost-11 month old. I turn it on and she starts crying as soon as it starts moving around and playing music. And this is a kid that isn't easily startled - she'll sleep through the dog barking. I don't know what it is about this toy, but she is not a fan!"
1,Waste of money,"I bought this toy for my 8-month old to encourage him to start crawling. I looked at many and choose this one because of its dual features - I figured that once my son started to crawl he would have an interest in pressing the shapes and animal figures. Well, to start with the motion of the ball sucks! The first time I started it up, it rolled away from him then promptly back towards him and repeatedy smacked him in the head. This caused him to shy away from it for the longest time. Now that he can crawl, the added features are a waste of time. The voice proclaiming things like ""it's a duck"" goes off randomly without baby having to press the said animal so it teaches nothing about the animals or cause and effect. I should have returned this toy but waited too long - now it will just sit on the shelf gathering dust."
3,Doesn't roll much,"I was really hoping for a toy for my daughter to chase when she started crawling... but it really just rolls in a circle. It doesn't give you much time to find what it asks you to find either... and when it says ""where's the pig?"", until you know which is which animal... they don't look like much except a blob!"
1,no cause and effect,"this ball only moves in little circles if you have carpet. It tells you to find/press a certain button, gives you about 1 second (not enough time!), then moves on to some song or something else. It randomly plays music whether you push buttons, roll it, or not, and my daughter played with it for about 2 or 3 minutes the first time, and not at all since then.Too bad."
3,"Could hurt! , Concerned Grandmother","I Bought 2 of these balls, one for my Grandson & one for my handicapped Grandaughter ( they are 20 days apart). My Grandson was 5 months at the time, he loved it, but then got bored with it by 8 months. My Grandaughter was 6 months, she needed tummy time, so we thought this would be good for her, Wrong! It hit her head, ran over her fingers, and basically scared her to death! Now that she's 20 months, she really enjoys it and follows it all over while crawling around, even her 19 month cousin, is back playing with his again. I would be very careful and really look at your childs abilities, before buying this toy. Older children seem to enjoy it more and can understand what it is saying better than younger and can press the correct pictures that it asks for. Younger children just want to ""bat it"" around, like any ball, but it's really hard and can hurt them when it rolls back fast!"
4,Mother of Twins,I bought this for my sons when they were only a few months old. At first I was concerned that they did not appear interested it the item. Now at 10 months it is a must whenever we visit people. They love to sit with it on the carpet and push the buttons or chase it around the hardwood floors. I only wish the colors used for the animals were more realistic. I've never seen puppy with blue spots before and as an educational toy I wish they would stay truer to reality.
1,BUST,"I'm surprised, but this toy was a bust with my son. We got it for him when he was 9 mo old. He'd rather play with other balls that aren't making noise. I'll try it again soon, but so far, not so good."
1,not worth the money,"Thank goodness we received this as a gift. My daughter is super un-impressed and never plays with this ball. Mommy hates it too -it makes this obnoxious giggle sound that makes me want to crawl out of my skin. And it plays forever after baby stops touching it - I don't like that it's not a good feedback toy. Its really awful if you forget to turn it off before baby goes to sleep. Next thing you know, you walk by it, the flor squeaks or shakes a second and this toy starts shrieking. I will never buy this for anyone else nor recommend it"
2,Pointless.,"We got this to help our son learn to crawl. It makes sense to learn to crawl on something soft, like carpet, but this ball doesn't roll or move well on carpet. In addition it was very annoying. In general, our son did not enjoy it much at all. I would not recommend it."
3,doesn't roll on carpet,This ball wont roll on carpet but my 6 month old still enjoys it a lot with the sounds and lights on it...she also likes the tags on the ball..I really don't know whats with these babies abt why they like the tags on the toys than the toy itself.
1,Broken Record After Only a Few Months,"Who thought it was a good idea to build an electronic ball out of hard plastic?! Delicate electronics cannot take the kind of shock that is dealt to them inside such a poor design.This was a gift to our child less than 6 months ago and about 4 months in, it began to glitch randomly, getting stuck on a sequence of sound like a broken record. When power-cycled it wou.ld work just fine again. Things just kept getting worse though and now it won't come out of its glitch at all. Turn it on and it just plays a single note and light repeatedly and other buttons are unresponsive.It's sad that our child actually enjoyed this toy and now is totally disappointed by it. Without the electronics, it's not even a good ball for rolling!Total waste of money. Poor execution of a poor design."
5,So fun,Thanks so much! It was just was I was needing and what was shown in the photos & description! !!
1,Most Annoying Electronic Toy Ever!,"Ok toy, but the voice recordings are the most annoying ever created. They were driving me crazy. Finally I jammed a screwdriver into the speaker and killed it. Now I can operate it in peace."
2,Frightening...,"This toy would be great... BUT my 8 month old is terrified of it. She has good reason to be, I suppose. The darn thing rolls and smacks her in the head."
3,Very Heavy,"This was a cute toy, but it is very heavy and I was always concerned that it would knock my daughter in the head and injure her. It is probably not an issue with this toy but for my own comfort we stopped using it."
2,Not a great toy,"Got thisVtech - Move & Crawl Ballafter reading all the good reviews. It does keep my 7 month old son entertained for 2-3 minutes. It does say numbers (but just 123), shapes and makes animal sounds. All of these are very confusing on the same button. Hence it does not have much of educational value as advertised. Another concern I have is the ladybug on top. My son has fallen on it a few times and got hurt.The ball just rotates in one place, can't really push it on the floor. All that my son loves in this toy are the small ribbon pieces as he can chew and suck on them"
4,Fun toy,"My son is 4 months old and he really likes this ball.Although, he can't crawl yet, he is very interested in the light and the sounds. He likes to watch it rolls, which is great because it rolls by itself.Great toy for a tummy time. But, always under your supervision."
1,Very Annoying,"As each child is different, I can't say whether or not your child would enjoy this toy. Mine did not, but a friend's baby did, so I gave it to her. My son never took a look at this thing.What I can say is that voice is really grating - it's an annoying toy that starts talking when no one is near it! Also, the movements it makes are very jerky - mine didn't roll so much as move a little to the left and a little to the right and then it would stop.I hated this toy, but perhaps if your child likes it, and you can put up with the annoyance factor, it'd be a hit for you."
5,Movin' and Crawlin'!,"I LOVE this thing! GREAT product, GREAT deal, GREAT times to look forward to with my grandson - he simply goes nuts over it! Thanks!"
2,So-so ...,"This toy needs work ... First of all, it's HEAVY! My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up and throw it. After all, it IS a ball! We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors! We don't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you're asked to find something on the ball, even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time. So, I don't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time.I think this is a nice idea for a toy, but it just doesn't work. It is colorful, and my daughter does enjoy throwing it, but that's obviously not it's intended use. She never played with this toy as a crawling infant. She only plays with it now, and she only throws it. Please don't waste your money on this toy. It's not worth it!"
4,Great for litlle ones,My 3 month old girl loves this toy. She sits in her bumbo and we hold it for her. The buttons are very sensitive. Therefore the slightest touch will set off sounds and lights.
1,not age appropriate,"This toy is not very interactive or safe. To keep the ball moving you have to push the number/shape/animal that it names in a short amount of time. By the time my son figures out the right one, it has already shut down and restarts itself when he pushes the button, so he does not get to hear the ""cheers"" when he finds the right one. He gets bored with it so he decides to pick it up and throw it like any ball, but it is so heavy that he can't throw it very far and it ends up landing on his foot or leg, which makes him cry. Definately think twice before purchasing!"
4,8 month old loves it,"My 8 month old loves this toy. She likes the lights and sounds. The rolling motion doesn't scare her at all. She LOVES the tags on the top. There are two volume settings. We keep ours on the low setting and it isn't loud or overbearing. There are only a couple of songs so it gets a little redundant, but that doesn't seem to bother the baby. We do switch it to the off position at night so the batteries do not wear down. We've been using it for a month and it's a great toy."
2,disappointed,"This toy worked for about a week. Sometimes it won't work at all, other times the song repeats and gets stuck halfway through. Not worth the money I paid for it."
3,VTech - Move & Crawl Electronic Activity BallVTech - Move & Crawl Electronic Activity Ball,Not sure this Activity Ball from Vtech was worth the price but as least was animated and rolled around making noise to catch the attention of the little one.
4,engaging toy,Great toy for special needs children. I use this with my hypotonic 10 month old to encourage him to get up on his elbows and pivot. Motivates him to roll and teaches him cause and effect. One of his favorite toys.
3,Meh.,"My daughter was interested in this for only a month or two. She'd watch the flashing lights, tug at the ribbons, and occasionally smack the buttons. By the time she actually started learning how to crawl, she was bored with the ball. Now she just crawls right past it and toward her stacking cups, books, and plush toys. Light-up blinky things only go so far!The other reviewers are right; this ball doesn't really encourage crawling. It's cute, it lights up and plays annoying songs, it barks and meows, and it's amusing for a little while, but that's it."
5,My grandson loves it!,"I have not been to visit my daughter since giving this Vtech ball as a gift to my grandson, but I have been told that it is a great motivation for him to start to crawl. My daughter told me that it is one of his very favorite toys. He was just over 4 months old when he received it as a gift and now at 6 months old he is moving all over the place just to get at it. This is a great toy for motor skill developement."
5,so cute,love it! love love love it~ it rolls around with him and the buttons are easy to push. he enjoys this and other v-tech toys a lot
1,Snoooore!,"The concept is good and cute, but this ball is just not a hit. My baby has barely ever played with this thing and we've had it since he was just a few months old and he's now almost 12 months. This toy is boooorrrrring! :("
3,Move and Crawl ball,"Hi My Name is Sean Nguyen, I have recently bought 2 Crawl Ball but the real product that you had sent me wasn't the one shown on the Web. My daughter is really likes the one as showing on the Webside. I therefore still have the two balls purchased from you in the closet because I had already bought too many of them. I wished that I should get what was shown on the Web. Thnx"
3,Works OK,"I've found the hardware to be a bit buggy. The main communication to and from the serial ports is pretty good, but the unit will occasionally lock up for no reason."
5,Always Relevant,"I feel as if Dykes to Watch Out For is the original L Word. Anything by Bechdel is worth reading. She's entertaining, yet poignant with her story lines. This book is a great insight into gay culture in the eighties, nineties, today, and the future i'm sure."
3,"No, I'm not a conservative!","Let me repeat: I do not belong to ""the vast, right-wing conspiracy."" I don't like conservatives; they are stupid. Having said that, let me say that this was a great satire of knee-jerk liberals and their sacred cows. It was funny on several levels: from slapstick to satire. The satire was the best. This movie has been long overdue to challenge the pervasive,unrelenting leftist propaganda coming out of Hollywood. Predictably, the liberals had a fit over the movie and their attack was ingenious: their reviews of the movie claimed that it was not funny at all (I guess it wasn't for them). And what did the stupid conservatives do? They stayed home and failed to support the movie.Unfortunately, the movie is at times disjointed, the most obvious being when in the middle of the movie, it cuts to an audition for a movie."
2,If Rush Limbaugh and Carrot Top had a baby...,"I am a fan of many of Zucker's comedies. That said, this is just not that funny. I am a socially conservative republican and I knew that this satire of Michael Moore and the political left would have a certain perspective. However, I thought I was going to be watching a comedy in the context of the politics. The reality is that this movie is preachy, heavy-handed, jingoistic rant masked in a thin ""veneer"" of comedy.Yes, it had a few funny moments but a handful of successful gags does not a successful comedy make, especially when the backdrop contains serious, real life political issues. I watch comedies to escape the world, not to be challenged in my thinking related to such weighty topics as liberty, patriotism, an terrorism. For that I'll watch a documentary (an irony in and of itself if you watch this film)."
5,"""An American Carol"" -- Buy It Like Your Freedom Depends Upon It","This film extols the freedom this country has known -- Zucker style. Produced and distributed before the most corrupt election in US history, the film gave those of us who saw it in the theaters a taste of what was to come.For those of you who talk of poor box office showing, there's a reason for it, which the gentlemen producers chose to keep mum about. Just as in the election, major fraud occurred in some theaters, and ticket monies for ""Carol"" were credited to other films. Other ""dirty little tricks"" occurred as well, which successfully confused would-be filmgoers.So if you love freedom, here's your chance to vote again, and buy the DVD.-- Praising Jesus Christ for the FREEDOM His morality gives us."
2,"I want to love it, but I can't","Anything that puts it to Michael Moore where it hurts is great by me. Alas, this movie is just not top-quality film-making. While David Zucker's (and Jim Abrahams') Airplane! and Naked Gun trilogy make the tears roll down my face throughout, at best I chuckled a few times during An American Carol. It seems Zucker was less intent on making a good satirical comedy than he was preaching. Even though I agree with the sentiments this movie expresses, it just didn't work well as satire. I am grateful that he did not include some of the deleted scenes because a few are tasteless. If Zucker was intent on countering the insanely left-wing Hollywood culture, he may actually have had the opposite effect."
2,Not What I expected,"I expected this to be a laugh a minute movie and was very disappointed in it. Basically, if you saw the trailers you saw the entire movie.Not funny even if you dislike Michael Moore. Don't waste your money."
4,WWJD?,"Lisa (Ingalls):Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, so many generic accusations and conspiracy theories! Where are your specifics? How can you suggest that this election was more corrupt than those of 2000 and 2004? And how can you invoke JC in the same breath as your j'accuse pronouncements? What would He have done?In any event, this IS a funny flick - this coming from a died in the wool independent who also appreciates Michael Moore's efforts."
2,"I agree w/Mr.Lee. Movie does not play, only the previews play!","On a Phillips blu ray player BDP7200/37 with the most recent firmware update (April 2008) and trying 2 different blu-ray disks of American Carol (from two different retailers, the second being Amazon, both did not play. Unless Phillips has more updates, this will have to be returned too. ANYONE HAVE ANY OTHER SOLUTIONS?"
5,A laugh riot!!,"This movie is a brilliant satire with great humor and an important message that's delivered in a clever manner.Well worth the price, and it deserves a place on everyone's entertainment shelf!"
5,"In The Slapstick Spirit Of Airplane And Police Academy, This Movie ROCKED If You're A Conservative!","When I heard about the premise for AN AMERICAN CAROL, I gotta tell you it sounded stupid to me. Who's gonna want to watch some spoof about Michael Moron wanting abolish Independence Day? With that mindset already firmly established, I watched the film from start to finish. OMG, what a raucously hilarious slap directly in the face of liberalism! As the plot unfolds with the character ""Michael Malone"" being visited by various people including John F. Kennedy, General Patton (played brilliantly by Kelsey Grammer), and even the death angel, the audience is given compelling reasons to support war in order to best preserve the peace. The liberal notion to just sit down and talk out the problems is shown for the fraudulent strategy that it is. WELL DONE!!!!"
1,disapointed,"I saw a trailor for this movie on ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"". I am a Christian, and I thought (since Expelled is a documentary in support of creation)that this would be an appropriate comedy. Sadly, this film is untasteful. I turned it off within the first five minutes or so. I had already heard a few curse words (one from a young girlscout) and the Lord Jesus Christ was blasphemed. Films like these should never be advertised in connection with creation films. It's sad that our great nation under God allows such irreverence on a regular basis. Even on normal television programing we have disregarded the name of God and our only hope for salvation, Jesus Christ. We have come a long way from our founding."
1,Blu Ray Disc Wouldn't Play,Disc played 2 previews and wouldn't play anything else! I've got about 100 BD discs and this is the first that wouldn't work.
1,most extreme right-wing movie ever,"Movie wasn't funny, this is such a disgrace that such a great actor, Leslie Nielson played in the movie. It was very offensive and alienating to practically everyone in the world. Stupid attempt to justify all the wrong doing of the Bush administration."
1,Grotesque,"Apparently, the likes of David Horowitz, Elliot Abrams, TobyKeith, Dr. Laura and Tim LaHaye got together to make a film.Painfully unfunny, intellectually dishonest, hypocritical inthe extreme... this is very likely the worst movie I haveever seen, and I have seen some truly awful movies."
1,Movie only for Hardcore Republicans,You will only enjoy this movie if you are a Republican. I as an Independant did not. It is basically a movie bashing Rosie O'Donnell andMichael Moore as well as perceived Democratic beliefs(and like it or not O'Donnell and Moore have the same rights of free speech as O'Reilly and Limbaugh) and I do not listen to any of them on both sides. I personally am tired of fighting between Republcans and Democrats. Get over it already and by the way there are good Christians on both sides of the line and it is not Christian to bash anyone regardless of their political beliefs.
1,worthless piece of crap,"I just finished a painful viewing of this newly purchased DVD. I am all for supporting good conservative humor, but this movie is such a piece of crap that amazon won't even let you resell a used copy of it. Unbelievable."
3,Funny Movie with a Conservative Point of View,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 2008... recently found it in the bargain bin at a local discount store.... I have to tell you, this is a funny movie that pokes fun at liberal ideology and beliefs. Very pro U.S.A. and a hoot. I'll have to watch it again now that I have the DVD. Not recommended for libeerals."
3,A Bit Edgey,"First, I appreciate the fact that the movie was from the conservative side...the movie industry has been dominated by liberals and reprobates for so long the movie is a breath of fresh air...but only for that fact. The humor was often times crude. For example throughout the entire movie children and adults would make a masturbation gesture. Being directed or produced by the same guy that did ""Airplane"" you can see the same lines of humor come through.Don't get me wrong, there were some pretty funny parts and the movie was constantly putting it to the ridiculousness of the liberal worldview...that was pretty nice, no, that was wonderful! Overall decent movie but if good morals and clean comedy are your thing, this probably isn't for you."
5,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY,"It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time for a good laugh. I am a conservative person and thought they were right on in the most fun way possible. It is about time we make fun of the most left wing radical nonsense people out there and I really think it is a great way to do it with a lot of fun and not all serious attacks. RIGHT ON AND VERY VERY FUNNY. A must see for any right wing person that does not believe in all the left wing radical nonsense, you will get a good laugh and see you are not alone out there."
1,I agree with the Top Critics at RottenTomatoes...,"I agree with the Top Critics at RottenTomatoes. They gave it the lowest rating possible - 0% of them gave it a favorable rating... and for good reason, VARIETY: ""Poorly made indie production has a script that feels like a list of ripostes collected over the last several years to liberal criticisms of the US. The whole enterprise feels far more agenda-than entertainment-driven."" PHILADEPHIA INQUIRER: ""An American Carol is about as not-funny as a comedy can get."" FILM JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL: ""Forget about politics for a moment. Carol is first and foremost a terrible piece of filmmaking, marred by bad performances, cringe-inducing dialogue and amateurish direction."" The only positive reviews of this film on Amazon are from folks directed here from right-wing blogs to trick people into buying this poor piece of propaganda. Don't be fooled!"
1,Greatest flop ever!,"This pile of garbage LOST $13 million at the box office, LOL! It cost $20 million to make and only had $7 million in ticket sales. What a joke. Conservatives have no imagination or sense of humor."
2,The funniest part of this movie !,"This is a Typical Chicken Hawke Movie>>>...This movie claim's that terrorist are the greatest threat to the USA since Hitler & Nazi'sYet not one (I Repeat) not 1 of the the pro war actor's in this movie (Kelsey Gramber, Bill O'Reilly,Jon Voight & Some country singer) served our country in any war or signed up for military service after 9/11 to defend the USA. It's easy to be pro war when someone else is fighting your battles."
3,"Some laughs, controversial message","I got this video hoping the production team had returned to the days of glory of ""Airplane"". Indeed, the movie has some great gags and is absolutely ruthless in making fun out of everything you can think of... This is ""no mercy"" humor at its best. However, a few of the gags don't work, and the film overall doesn't have the same rhythm found in ""Airplane"" and ""Airplane 2"". My disappointment came at the last third of the film, when the producers start leaving comedy aside and begin delivering a clear ""support our troops, no matter what"" message, which I find questionable, to say the least. The movie turns into propaganda, and loses the comedy angle it started out with. So I give it 5 stars for the first half, 1 star for the last third."
3,Movie is okay,"I saw this in the theater; it was funnier there. I recently bought it, and although there were still several funny parts, if you're liberal, you probably won't appreciate this movie, although it might give you pause. Conservatives will find this very humorous and find themselves nodding in agreement. This movie reminds us what a great country we live in."
4,Couldn't help laughing.,"Very partisan, but then, so many movies are propaganda for a different political point of view. We found it funny and just enjoyed it in a very biased way!"
2,Only 2 1/2 Stars,"I was hoping that this was going to be a good parody of those goofy lefty documentaries that the beautiful people lap up, but it didn't deliver. Some great talent assembled for the show, but it looks like they rushed the script to get it to market. No story, no peace."
1,A shocker!,"Politics aside, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. The lack of focus and humour in this movie evokes Ed Wood in its style-- it's simply much easier to laugh at it than to laugh with it. The difference from Ed Wood's style is that this film is not wacky and fun, rather just a jumble of ridiculous stereotypes. I wanted to like it, since I loved all of the Naked Gun and Airplane films. In the end, though, it just isn't funny to laugh at needless insults without any comedic value. Were you one of the bullies in this playground who always picked on others for being different in any way you can imagine? If yes, then you might like this film. It always feels good to assure yourself that your mob mentality and bigotry are well justified in some sort of 'defense of what's right'. Overall, though, the filmmakers manage only to portray conservatives as really childish and 'none too bright'. ;)"
5,Just sorry it has to be a comedy spoof!!,"This movie speaks to the heart of what most Americans believe and it's just a shame that Hollywood feels that they have to portray that in the form of a comedy film rather than a truthful, serious and accurate film of Patriotism and love of country. But given the less than tolerant attitude of Hollywood and others in this country, this is the best we can do! And it is SUPERB!!! WTG Zucker for making a brilliant film...and giving us good laughs in the process!"
2,not that great,"I really wanted to love this movie. I have a very silly sense of humor and I am firmly conservative on many issues, but it just wasn't as great as everyone is saying. maybe I need to watch it again and give it another chance. very disappointed. it could have been so much better."
5,"The Blu-ray Looks Good since it encoded it MPEG-4 AVC, but there is only one big complaint and that is that it really lacks Hi-D","If you are Michael Moore, the ACLU, or a liberal you might not like this movie. Otherwise this movie is like that old story you hear every year for Christmas with Ebenezer Scrooge, except it is a big wake up call about how great America can be if you let it be. Ebenezer Scrooge is played by Michael Malone. He is visited by three ghost General George S. Patton, Angel of Death (Trace Adkins,) and John F. Kennedy.The Blu-ray Looks Good since it encoded it MPEG-4 AVC, but there is only one big complaint and that is that it really lacks Hi-Def sound like Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, or my personal favorite Linear PCM. Only includes a Dolby Digital 5.1 track.The bottom line is that I recommend it, plus you just might learn something about how great America really is."
1,Just Another Bad Movie.,"The first 20 minutes or so are ok, and have some funny scenes. But then it turns too ridiculous and senseless to be either funny, or interesting as a social commentary.I am speechless."
2,So not-funny that it's funny!,"I had heard how bad this was and had the idea to play it for my friends at my 4th of July barbecue. We were not disappointed. This movie was so poorly written and poorly executed that it made us all laugh.Don't get me wrong, the jokes were not funny, but it was funny that they were supposed to be. How many times can you fat jokes and people being hit in the head really be funny? They flogged the dead horse by making a joke about the Michael Malone character's weight or hygiene SO MANY TIMES. And the Jihadist characters: they just kept making those guys do the same jokes over and over again.This slapdash piece of crap is great for a laugh with your friends, but if you're looking for something that actually has merit or funny jokes...sorry, keep looking."
3,"No matter how you vote, there are some laughs here for you...","I'm a moderate Democrat. I've enjoyed several of Michael Moore's films, while finding the man himself frequently quite annoying. This movie satirizes him and his fans, with no harm done. It's worth a rental, in spite of many imperfections. While not as sharp as ""Airplane"" it really does have a handful of inspired moments. We of the center/left often criticize those of the center/right for being unable to take a joke or to lighten up. Let's not be guilty of the same charge. It's just goofy fun, and 90 minutes of relief from the real problems of the country."
4,Simply The Nastiest,"Short Dawg is one of the mst vulgar rappers you will ever hear and this CD is not for the faint of heart. I enjoy the beats and was lucky enough to come across the clean version of this CD some of the songs (such as the duet with ICE CUBE) have so many vulgarities in them that you cannot even hear the song because of the editing. short dawg always did a clean side and a dirty side to his albums and I always prefered the clean stuff. My favorite song by him to this day is the song ""The Ghetto"" If you enjoy old school rap and are not easily offended this comes highly recomended."
3,"Anthony Willis (Media, PA)","All of you have forgotten the most important point. If you look at the back of the CD you will notice that the ""The Ghetto"" is listed at 5:59 but when you play the CD you will notice that song has been edited; the best part of the song was lefted off the CD. The originial CD I bought in the 90's had the entire song, but the one I bought recently is about a minute shorter and you miss the significance of the song without that last minute.You have to hear that part of the song to really appreciate the song."
2,Short Dog Should Leave The House,"Nowadays it's easy to see that Snoop Dog stole his sound and persona from Short Dog. like Snoop, Too Short's tepid beats and predictable rhymes are uninspiring and limp. Fans of hard core rap will be bored, though fans of funk influenced hip hoppers like Snoop Dogg and Luscious Jackson will doubtless be impressed. Short is a bit like a Tone Loc without the wit. I admit that the Ice Cube duet `Ain't Nothing But A Word To Me ` is amusing but that ain't enough to recommend the album. Skip it."
5,Don't let the cover photo fool you!,"In spite of the tough-looking photo on the cover, I found ""Three Collections"" full of insightful, vivid, thoughtful poems. Comprised of sections from three of the authors series of poems, ""The Women,"" ""My Roaring 20's,"" and ""The Brenda Poems"", this books offers a little something for everyone. ""The Women"" details poems written about women from all walks of life; ""My Roaring 20's"" is a gritty, realistic look at Lewis' second decade, chronicling troubled relationships and growing self-awareness; and ""The Brenda Poems"" are a collection of dialogues between the writer and the (I think) fictional Brenda. The author cleverly uses this device to address issues in male/female relationships. I'm not usually a fan of poetry, but reading this book (recommended by a friend who also writes poetry) made want to dig deeper into the genre."
1,Not A Book A Link,"Although I knew this was a book that can be found in the public domain, nowhere in the description of this 'book' is it mentioned it is really a link to a website, Sacred Texts. I was expecting a version made for an ereader, that's what I thought I was paying for. Selling a repackaged public domain work is one thing, selling a link is a rip off."
3,"interesting, but overpriced","This book is, firstly, a public domain work and SHOULD be free. All in all,it does give some information, but, half the book is an editorial. I have published books much longer than the editorial, and still charge less. It is interesting but only deserves 3 stars due to the price"
4,jonathan butler,i've always love the album heal our land. amazon.com helped me locate it on cd when all the record stores I went to said that it was not put on cd at all and good luck finding it
5,A great purchase,This has been an excellent purchase for us! I was looking for something cuddly that my daughter could rest her head on at night in her crib (she is 18 months). She absolutely loves this sweet lamb - was a perfect lovey for her to use each night.
3,Nice and soft but...,"...kind of smallish. I noted the dimensions, but they seem a bit misleading. This was very small. Cute, soft and cuddly, but a baby will not fit on it much at all."
2,not exactly what's advertised,"Add me to the list of mildly dissatisfied customers for this product. I was shopping for a video to use to tone my thighs and, since I regularly practice yoga and am fond of yoga in general, I thought I would see what Sara Ivanhoe had to say. I thought she might have some suggestions for exercises or positions I don't usually do in my regular yoga practice. She didn't. If only these moves were necessary to create ""sculpted buns and thighs,"" my buns and thighs would *already* be sculpted because I've been doing warrior poses and whatnot for years. At the same time that I got this video, I also got ""Look Great Naked: Thighs,"" and so far I am far happier with that product than with Ivanhoe's video."
5,Sublime,"The ""return"" of the master. Although not as good of a read, imho, as MY LAST SIGH, this is still required reading for Bunuel fans, and still retains all of the great artist's power, humor, and insight. In an era of big bucks and ready-made food, it stands out like a whale among minnows."
5,Laugh out loud funny,"I am an elementary school librarian and read this book to sophisticated sixth graders. They laughed out loud, and demanded an immediate second reading. The story is told in two alternating voices, and with each turn one story teller tries to trump the other. The illustrations are eye-popping and dazzling.We followed the read-aloud, with a stab at our own creation by alternating boy and girl voices. Our story ended with a pop star performing at the Oscars wearing a designer dress laced with itching powder.If you are a librarian, you will want multiple copies for your collection. If you are a classroom teacher, you will want one to stimulate storytelling. And, if you have a reluctant reader, s/he will gobble this one up."
5,What we think-- GES 5/6 class,"This book was very funny. It was funny when the main characters fought back and forth about a story they were supposed to write together. It was supposed to be a fairy tale. They fought about the story because the girl wanted the story to be about a princess and the boy wanted the story to be about a motorcycle dude. The book has a clever solution to this problem.Another cool thing about this book is the illustrations. There are three different illustrators for the three different plots going on.We recommend this book for readers who like funny fairy tales, books with a little action and a bit of a twist."
5,GREAT read aloud!,"I check this book out from the library and have read it at LEAST 15 times! I read it to my son's kindergarten class not once but, THREE times. I only stopped because the bus came. All of the kids were yelling for more, I felt like a rock star. Very fun book!"
5,Awesome condition,The book came very quickly. It was in excellent condition. I was very happy with the entire purchase.
5,Questions gender stereotypes through exageration,"My son thought this book had very cool illustrations and it was very cute. I thought that it did a great job of portraying gender stereotypes and poking fun at them. In the end, does a dude or a princess really want to weave gold for life? Of course not. The exagerated stereotypes brought out a lively discussion about gender issues with my third grader."
3,Example of a put down,"Boy is against girl instead of boy appreciating or supporting the girl's fairytale idea. Boy might have his own fairytale style, but do not like the way he puts off the girl's. Funny for my kindergarten boy, but he doesn't really understand, yet. Do want to teach my child to be kind, respectful and considerate of other people, even if they are girlish women."
5,Once Upon A Cool Motorcycle Dude,This is a great book and Amazon sold it at a great price. We received it sooner than I thought we would and it was in perfect condition. I will definitely shop at Amazon again.
5,Must Have!,"I have a boy and a girl, and although my daughter's not old enough to understand this book yet, I foresee a lot of fun reading it with her in the near future. The princess takes her place in the world and defies conventional thinking. The motorcycle dude, well, he's a motorcycle dude. Cool as one can be. It's a fun read even after the 20th time."
5,Good News for Readers!,"This book, long out of print, will be republished by Mulberry Press in Spring 2006 in paperback!"
5,True Love,"This book...was so adorable in a sense. You see character transformation from order /ordinary life, to how love can make everything look so beautiful. This story is very cute and I will read it again when I find the time."
5,Deep immersion in Kyoto cuture,"Pico Iyer writes so well. His images are fitting and so graphic, yet his touch is very refined. His treatment of his relationship with a married Japanese woman reveals the Japanese culture of the 1980's (much of which carries over to today) and draws the reader into caring about these people. The way the communications are carried between people is so different than what the American direct style. It gives a lot to consider in the way we relate with others, It is not primarily a spiritual book, but way more than a travel book."
2,Breaks trust between reader and writer,"I loved this book at first and then began to slowly grow distrustful of the author. He's constantly hooking up with ""The Lady"" to goto various places around Japan but around halfway through the book, she's gushing feelings of love to him and he's weirdly stoic. The odd clue like them sharing a hotel room and meeting up in a foreign county make it seem as if he's hiding something. Once that feeling was in me, the book became a lot less fullfilling. I kept thinking about The Lady's two kids and, really, how lame the author was acting (especially after finding out they currently live together in Kyoto).It's also a lazy book. the author doesn't even try to learn the language before moving to Japan and spends half the book with various foreigners living in the country. A far superior book about a foreigner residing in Japan and REALLY living with the Japanese and writing about their lifestyle/culture is LEARNING TO BOW."
1,The Lady and the Monk : Four seasons in Kyoto,"Sorry Pico, I wasn't able to finish this one! It swings between being cliche and condescending to outright fantasy! ""A high mountain clarity sharpened the October air"" (talking about Narita Page 3). There isn't a mountain within about 100KM of Narita, it's situated in rice fields! He makes another reference early in the book about street vending machines full of every kind of fruit juice you can imagine. I wish it were so! The only fruit juice you can buy in a vending machine is from an American soft drinks company, sometimes! I use these two early points to illustrate the distortions of living in Japan which continue throughout the book (on almost every page). Mr. Iyer has written a fantasy, which really gives an unclear picture of life in Japan."
4,Japan's original love story,This mesmerizing story of a traveler from America meeting a life of Japan. We meet a monk and a lady as the story unfolds. The author meets these people and falls in love with Japan: The life and the freedom
5,Splendid!!,"This is Pico Iyer at his best. His insights are valuable and is descriptions are keen, yet tender. The relationship with the Japanese women is gentle and really brings out the strength of this modern Japanese women"
4,Asian Culture,I read this book after living in Japan for 7 months. Unfotunately I never made it to the other world in Japan...Kyoto. I lived in Tokyo the entire time and time simply passed by. A great descriptive book of the vast differences that exist between the west and east. Fun informative reading with a flare for the travel mind.
1,Worst Book I Have Read in a Long Time,"When I think of The Lady and the Monk, I can't think of one coherent theme in the book. It seems to be more about the incoherent ramblings of a Santa Barbra hippie than a treatise on travel or finding one's self. I feel dumber for having read this and I hope Mr. Iyer never writes anything again."
3,ok romance movie,ok romance movie nice to see what everyone was watching in the 80 not the best i have seen but ok.
1,Scruples,"Its a great mini series, I saw it many years ago when it played on TV, but I am not able to watch it on my dvd player!!!! It will not play because my dvd player is also a recorder, it states that in small print on the dvd case. It did not state that when I ordered it, otherwise I would NOT have ordered it since I can't play it on mine. Very unhappy, have written (via e-mail) to the sender and have not heard back to date, its been a couple of weeks and no response.Janice Masse"
1,Buyer beware,"I love this miniseries and was quite excited about its release on DVD. Unfortunately, I have to report that the quality of the DVD is abysmal. I am on second copy having sent the first one back because of all the skipping, etc. The second one is even worse. You would think that there would be some kind of quality control. Now I have to waste time sending the second set back. So unless you have a lot of patience and nothing better to do - buy the DVD."
5,Never seen anything like it,"This book blew me away. I have never seen anything like it. The tour through the Windows OS is the best I have seen. It provided just what I needed to understand the rest of the book.I am not a developer by trade but this book made me feel like it. I began to understand how Sql is designed as only someone who had written it could. I still consider myself a beginner developer but I'm not a beginner with Sql anymore.The SQL-Xml exposition is a book of its own. Over 100 pages of the deepest, best info you could hope for. SAme thing for DTS, replication, Notification Svcs and several others.I really liked the engine internals. I use this info nearly every day in my day job supporting Sql. You can't go wrong with this book."
4,Too deep,"Maybe very good for geeks but for us simpletons who just want to get the work done, this goes too deep into internals. Knowledge of internals is good but one should concentrate on practical day to day work issues. Regardless, the text is very well written and I am a big fan of Mr. Henderson and even though the text sometimes is not very easy to comprehend for a beginner like I, am sure I will learn to appreciate it even more in the days to come."
5,DOGGY STYLE,Doggy style is one of the tightest 80s skate punk bands that has ever play'd. this album ( with rib Finley on vocals) its super tight but as much as it pains me to say it their original singer daddy X ( now member of kotton mouth kings) has more of a raw punk sound and original 80s skate punk feel. keep in mind tho just because daddy x did one cool thing does NOT mean he is good at anything else!!!!
4,Awsome Roots,"These are some of the Kottonmouth Kings' first roots, with the punk/ska styles coming out. Outspoken, with Kings playa Daddy X in this group, this is some awsome music. Just listen to the music samples if you can't find it, if they don't sell anymore here. It is good for punk fans and those that love late 80s-early 90s fast paced music."
4,Very good album,I had never heard of Vincent Henry until recently. I was positively surprised with his work. This is a very solid album by this great artist. I recommend it.
5,A vividly presented adventure,"Down The Columbia by outdoor enthusiast and river expert Lewis Freeman is a wild and exciting memoir of a bold journey down the Columbia river, before the Grand Coulee and other dams somewhat calmed its rushing flows. Filled with respect for the majesty and savagery of Nature, Down The Columbia is a vividly presented adventure highly recommended for armchair travelers who aren't afraid to get their feet wet!"
3,Nice for very small kids,"Overall this is a pretty nice Bible story book for babies and toddlers, but the stories don't give a complete history, especially about Jesus. There isn't a story about how Jesus died. It's nice that each story can be read separately and the pictures are colorful and fun for kids."
2,Not the high-quality product that the original was,"I am very familiar with this publisher's products and have the Baby Blessings Christmas book. I was very disappointed to see that they had changed the cloth cover from the original and the book size is also smaller than the original. Now it doesn't look like it's part of a set with the Baby Blessings Christmas as the covers aren't alike and the books are not the same size! The current cover is noticeably lesser quality, very flimsy compared with the original, but more than that, it doesn't fit the book well at all. The book just slides around inside it and is on the verge of falling out. I would gladly pay the old price to have the old book. And it would be nice if the Bible book matched the Christmas one too.However, if you don't mind about the cover, or aren't familiar with the original, you probably won't have any complaints as the book itself is fine."
5,The Hilltop,"If your lucky enough to have his earlier albums,then this one is for you. He truly had the talentand many styles but unfortunately Vanilla Icegave a black eye to HipHop. You can't beat 80's HipHop.Love, Peace & Hairgrease"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A dark satire, I suppose you would call this. This shows what happens when humans go to an alien world, that has three races that exist in different ecological niches, basically. They aren't huge fans of each other, but mostly get along.Humans bring their warlike, country fighting and spying ways along, and teach the natives. People ain't nice."
4,excellent critique of American foreign policy,"At a time like this, when government propaganda is forced down our throats, Mahajan offers a devastating critique of U.S. foreign policy. He shreds the facade behind the ""war on terrorism."" He shows the hypocrisy of the vicious attacks on the people of Afghanistan under the guise of freedom. As he points out, the Bush government planned an invasion of Afghanistan prior to 9-11 . Why?- well, let's see- OIL.If more of the media had Mahajan's cynicism toward the government, the American people might know the real story behind the ""war on terrorism."" I await his forthcoming book on the invasion of Iraq.My only complaint is that he goes on side issues, like affirmative action, which have nothing to do with the subject. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Pass this one by,"Rahul Mahajan seems to think that in a world of international terrorism, rogue, criminal nations with WMDs, an irrational fear of globalism and a tremendous amount of religious extremism that the United States is the enemy of all nations and the root of all evil.I found Mr. Mahajan's arguments incomplete, mixed with inaccurate information or out of context. This book, in my own view, is mostly unsupported opinion and 'spun' viewpoint."
2,Emotional biased book not based on compelte facts,"This is a book that need to be read twice. It sounds plausible and well researched especially to someone that feels confused about the Iraqi developments (someone like myself). But closer attention to the barrage of facts show them to be a clever arrangement of half truths arranged to buttress a preconceived notion which is 'intellectually correct'.Americans are very sensitive about their sense of fairness. It is sad to see Authors like these take advantage of the innate naivete of well meaning readers.Take for example the chapters on myths about ourselves.Whatever the point (racism, free-speech etc) the US is far ahead of every decent sized country. Mahajan's perspective is opportunistic and shallow."
3,garbage story,"OK, dealing with garbage is real life, but do we have to read our children stories about digging through a dump? My daughter loves Zak and Wheezie, but I think the story could have been much more fun. I wish they had used another episode to base this book on. The message about recycling is good, though. If you missed this episode, I just wanted to explain that this book is not just about cleaning up the child's room, it includes the whole process of garbage from house to dump to recycling. Informative, yes, but fun, well, I don't think so."
4,group therapy,"**** LOVED THIS MOVIE ****it is what it is, a really good example of what a movie is whenyou really love looking at naked men. the plot dosen't matter.the bodys are all that matters, and there are some good ones in this"
1,Buy another DVD. ANYTHING would be better,"Complete and utter trash. But it provided me with an opportunity to see what a DVD does when you put it in the microwave!The acting is really pretty awful - almost something you would expect to find in a cheap porn film. The plot is flimsy, predictable and uninteresting and the filmography is very poor.I am no expert however on other people's likes and dislikes. I personally can stand a poorly made film if there is something about it that takes my interest. I struggled, but found nothing to redeem this offering. In fact - I have never seen it right through and that's a first for me.Sorry folks - I really cannot say that this one is worth the money!"
3,Love story . . . or not?,"""Picture Perfect"" is not your regular lesbian love story, and in the beginning I was also disappointed at the almost superficial way the author bypassed the Feelings! But the more I read, the more I liked this book. The focus of the narrative is NOT on the love between Kate and Casey; that's more like the motor behind it all.The important things (it seems to me) are the values in life - family values, the quality of life, etc.For a first novel it's very well done, very well written, with a lot of funny ""twists"" here and there! The characters are immensely likeable and I would have loved a hundred och so more pages!"
4,Best look at life on the PGA Tour in the early 60's.,Having known Lema and most of the players mentioned in the book duuring that period; the book realy tells it like it was.
4,Sony headphone with neckstrap,These are the only practical headphones for a portable MP3 player that I have come across since they allow you to clip the MP3 player on and the headphone and player hangs around your neck like a necklace. Sound quality is amazing too.
1,Ridiculous cord size,I just got this earphones and I've realized that it was the greatest waste of time and money of my life. I cannot use them on my phone and not even on my laptop. The cord is TOO SHORT. They have to be used ONLY on arm bands. I tried to cut the neckstrap off the cord and it damaged it. I am throwing it away. I don't even know how it sounds. It was just ridiculous.
1,The UPMOST WORST,I know that I have written a review (or two) that stated that the movie was the worst I've ever seen but this one is THE WORST I have EVER EVER seen.....I wanted to puke watching this waste of film !!!! I can not believe that it even made a star in reviews !!! And gays wonder why they have a bad rep !!!!!!!
4,"Really weird and low budget, but beautiful ending.","I almost quit watching this movie a quarter of the way though. The story gets incredibly outlandish and campy, with pop singer witches, possession, mockery of religion, talking sponges, and hidden vaginas, yet I decided to stick it out till the end, which was really cute and beautiful. I feel like some of the crazy plot could have been simplified to appeal to a much broader audience. I thought the dialogue was great, very modern and funny. The acting was a B+, the camera work was pretty good, and the underlying love story was very unique and appealing. Overall, I'm happy I chose to stick it out. Not in my top 100, but if you're not in a serious mood it's worth a watch."
5,Disney Tradition by Jim Shore (Seven Dwarfs Over Fallen Log Figurine,"What a fantastic ornament I gave this to my future daughter law at her wedding shower. Well, all the women there were in awww of this beautiful piece. We had to show it to everyone who attended the shower. It was packed perfect styro foam in between the dwarfs. The craftman work done on this piece was fawless. This is a perfect item to buy someone who you know loves disney. My daughter in law has it beside her computer so when she is on her computer she can always look at it."
5,Awesome!,This is one of my favorite pieces in my Jim Shore collection. I've been wanting one of these for quite some time after I saw my travel agent had one on her desk. She informed me that they were a limited collection (or so she said) and they didn't make them anymore.......On my fourth visit to Disney in Orlando I came across this in a shop and bought it and had it shipped home immediately!This price ($73.and change) with free shipping is a good deal....it's $85.00 in the parks and I paid considerably to have it shipped home (beats carrying stuff any day).
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Zero Hour is an ok story, although a little bit of the event to have an event thing going on, there are considerably worse varieties of the event story than this.It did, of course cause a bit of controversy over the whole Green Lantern thing.All the heroes, time melting, two big bad guys, and a nasty choice to make at the end."
2,Skip this book,"Zero Hour came as quite a disappointment to me. I am a sucker for a company wide team up story, and a big fan of Green Lantern, but this story just didn't resonate with me. At the end there are a few good pages involving Green Arrow and his conflicted emotional reaction to the situation. But as a whole it is just lackluster storytelling.If you want to see all your favorite DC heroes band together, do your self a favor and read Final Night, one of the Crisis on Multiple Earth books, or better yet just re-read Crisis on Infinite Earths."
4,it was about time,It was about time I looked on Amazon to get this comic!!! it took 5 minutes to find this book I was looking for ages and fast delivery made it the best present ever! thanks
2,Awful,"Oh yes, kidnapping and near rape is great for romance. (NOT.) She's a twit, he's an autocratic pig, they spent most of the time bickering, he did some shocking stuff that made it really hard to like him at all...I can't see what the fuss is with this author."
3,"First half good, second half bad.","The beginning of this book was very good and had me hooked up in a moment. After a while, however, the book grew tedious. All the fuss about the murder becomes boring. And I didn't like Quentin and all his whining. Some of the love scenes are forced and not enjoyable at all. Gray and Deb couldn't decide whether they wanted to be together or not. And the kidnapping in the end was just over the top."
1,didn't work,"didn't work with my ipod. maybe i bought the wrong one- but the whole description was confusing as hell. its NOT composite even though it talks about composite, and it didn't work on my color screen ipod nano."
2,Didn't Work,Didn't work with my IPOD nano generation 1. The generations have something to do with compatibility.
4,Prax Lotion helped with shingles rash,"I have used Prax Lotion successfully for a couple of years on an allergy rash. My wife, in desperation, tried it on her shingles rash. She said it worked quite well on the itching."
4,Better Than Normal,This is definitely worth the extra money to buy over a regular memory card. The extra memory is great for game saves that are usually supposed to take up an entire card!
4,Fireflies,I gave this book to my son-in-law on Father's Day. He and my daughter are expecting their first baby in November. He loved the gentle reminder of how many hours of fun he spent catching firefles in his youth.
1,Horribly stereotypical,"This book, along with 'Mommies are for Counting Stars', stereotypes gender roles so much that I probably won't even ready it to my son. Dads are shown as being active, fixing things and going to work, while moms mostly wait for their kids to come home and gestate babies while looking 'like a rose'. Not for families who are even a little progressive, or who have moms that work outside the home, or dads that stay at home."
4,great way to introduce students to Strauss,As a teacher I find this whole series (save one) to be a great way to introduce students to composers. This movie in particular captured the interest of my students. They enjoyed the music of Strauss which is played throughout the movie and the story was quite good. Because of this they wanted to hear more of Strauss' music and learn more about his life.
5,I am a Roberta Piket FAN!,"Roberta Piket is wonderful pianist. Her voicings, arrangements, use of the trio and all around piano trio concept are original and gorgeous.I especially appreciate the way she uses the bassist and drummer -- brilliantly integrated into her overall approach: tasteful AND swinging. Good stuff and highly recommended"
3,Cute,"This shoe is really cute, in fact, lots of the shoes on this website seem decent. I plan to make other purchases in the future."
5,Continuation of A Land Called Home.,Almost as good as the first book. These stories are so interesting and imformative. We read them over and over.
4,good replacement,my old battery would die within an hour and this was a smart and cheap replacement.
1,No Show,"I placed my order and waited for the batteries to arrive. They never did. I tried to use the tracking number supplied by the vendor but the Post Office informed me that I had to contact vendor. I sent 2 emails to the vendor and got no response. I called the Credit Card Company and canceled the transaction. A few days later I got an email from the vendor stating that I gave the wrong shipping address, yeah right. I replied asking them to provide the shipping address used. Never heard anything back from them. This was my first purchase from an Amazon Vendor and it will probably be my last."
4,It Keeps going,I looked for a reasonable price when I purchased my battery for the cell phone and I found it here.
5,Battery life is great!,"I've had this battery for over a month now, so have been able to test it thoroughly. I was initially skeptical because the price was so low... but the battery life is excellent!"
1,Motorola Lithium-ion Battery BR50,These batteries are defective. We just purchased one and the cell phone still didn't work. My husband went to the AT&T store and the salesman checked the battery for him. He said the battery was dead. If you like to pay for dead batteries then this company is the place you are looking for.
1,Battery,Was disappointed because the battery did not hold a charge. I bought a second one and had the same issue.Ended up getting a new cell phone.
1,Not a good battery,"This battery served me for a short time indeed ( a few months). It is still sort of okay, not dead- but I am finding that I have to charge it more and more often which is annoying. A good battery should hold it's charge longer. So maybe this is crap after all as so many of the reviews seem to indicate. I decided to try this cheapo one first because my AT&T; store first tried to talk me into a new phone ( I like my Razr phone) and then tried to sell me a new battery for $50.I have now found a comparable Duracell battery for my Razr phone that costs about $21. including shipping. The reviews say this is better than the original battery. Worth a try- Duracell is a good company."
3,Old Model,"works OK however, Motorola phones suck power fast. This is the oid model battery it was replaced with BR56 as far back as 2004."
1,Do not order this battery,"I received what was to be a new battery for my cell phone. First of all, it did not look like the picture. Second, when I placed it in my cell phone and charged it (all night), it did not hold a charge at all. I would make a call and it would start beeping as if it were low during the entire conversation. It didn't matter if it was 1 minute call or 10 minutes. I would not recommend this product."
2,Bad Batterys,Batterys did not hold a charge. After one or two breef calls battery was drained ofpower. My old battery holds a better charge. (This battery is 5 years old.)Would not purchase again.Rick
5,Does the job!,"After looking at several pricey replacement options for my old cell phone, I thought I would give this inexpensive battery a try. I was not expecting much after reading all the other comments. But, seriously, after charging it a few hours, it's a working battery that lasts 5-7 days. For the kind of price it's asking, I have no complains."
4,Lithium,"I recieved the battey in a timely mannor. It works well ,I will get two hours service before it needs a recharge."
4,Great! Battery,I bought this for my sister's cell phone and it worked liked a charm.. I highly recommend this product..
1,Don't bother.,"Battery does not hold a charge. Phone is dead after a couple of hours (standby, not talking!)"
1,B sure its the RIGHT BATTERY,Read the description VERY CLOSELY. I don't know what uses this battery.It is NOT the MOTORAZR2 V9X. It won't fit.So now I've got a cute play thing'e to piddle with.
3,battery for razor,I purchased these batterys for a cheep price yes but i get what i pay forthe battery has a short life one days worth of charge if i am conserative.Not too disapointed they do work and price is good.I was hopeing for something for nothingI guess. no regrets
4,Motorola Razr battery,Purchased a second battery to have it on hand when my other battery is no longer of use. Glad to have found a battery for my Motorola Razr Cell phone which is no longer available at T Mobile.
4,Cell phone battery,I thought I would have to give up my favorite cell phone because I could no longer get a battery from my service provider. Thanks Amazon. Not I can hang onto my phone for a while longer.
5,Motorola Battery,Needed to replace my old battery that no longer held a charge and this fit the bill exactly - great price & shipping costs and works great! Didn't need to do an expensive cell phone replacement!
4,It works well,It arrived in good condition and volt meter measurement got good reading. however I suspect it was used since the four metal contact points got fine scratches.
3,Invalid Battery Error with 1st Battery,"I received the BR50 and charged it for about 8 hours before trying to use it. Once I started using it there was no problems for about 2 weeks and then I received an Invalid Battery Error for no reason.I emailed SF Planet and they let me know they would send me a replacement and a shipping label for the bad battery very quickly, but it took about two weeks to receive the replacement. The slow turn-around time of the battery replacement is why they are at 3stars instead of 4stars. I figure anyone can have a product go bad from time to time. Yes, I would use them again, but hopefully they can pick-up their turn-around time."
2,"Dated and Expensive, just like me.","In February I bought a battery for $3.50 through but not from Amazon. It was dated and was not fresh, is failing after a few months. This $24.99 battery is the same item as the $3.50 one. The date on it indicates that it is 10 months old. It is the BR 50, black and white with the Motorola logo, not as pictured above.I returned this battery and have the option of ordering another dated, under $10 battery or paying $40 for one whose manufactured date I can inspect, from the AT&T; store."
1,Slim Li Ion Battery for the Motorola RAZR V3,"The price was cheap. The battery keeps a charge for 1 day & that's it. I keep the phone on for about 12 hours a day & on the 2nd day, the battery is dead after about 4 hours. It holds a charge about as long as the one I had before, which is a year old now. There is no manufacture date on this new battery, so it's probably just as old as my other one."
4,Good Buy,"I've had my Razr for nearly 2 years, and about 9 months ago, I noticed that the battery life had dramatically diminished. I finally got around to buying a new battery for the phone (in stores, they retail for as much as $45), and it worked like a charm. I was worried that the battery might not fit the phone, but it did."
1,wrong item,I was trying to order a battery for my motorola triumph cell phone. This was unfortunately the wrong size battery that was described in the site.
2,Disappointed,"Was disappointed. I thought this was a great deal, however, the battery doesn't hold a charge for more than a couple hours."
2,Inexpensive Battery for a reason,"I wanted to replace my 1 year old battery in my Motorola Razr. I found many batteries that were over $35. I found one battery which said it was an OEM for under $4.00. I guess you get what you pay for.The battery holds a charge very well, except when you make a phone call. After one call the battery is saying it needs to be recharged. I'm back to using my 1 year old battery, it holds a charge longer then the new one."
2,Low power battery,I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby (not making calls) before it went dead. I thought I had a problem with my RAZR V3M so I took it in and was informed that these batteries do not have enough milliamps required for the RAZR. They replaced it with the correct battery and I have been using that one now for over a year with no problem.
1,RIP OFF!!!,Do not buy this product!!! The batteries are not real. They loose their charge after the first 5 min phone call you make.
2,failed attempt,"I needed a battery for my razr3 cell phone and with a total for the battery and shipping less than $6 I gave it a shot. The battery had a low charge and I couldn't charge it any higher. So I shut off my phone when I'm not using it and charge it every couple of days. It wasn't worth sending it back, so I just made due."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Battery arrived dead and wasn't able to be charged in my phone. mMy advice? use your money to get a real Motorola battery, not an after market."
3,v3 RAZOR battery,Read all the reviews and selected this battery from the supplier with the best-rated batteries. It works no better than the one it replaced. Probably should have purchased a fresh battery from Motorola as suggested in other reviews.
2,Battery br50 for motorola,"I got the battery at my moms house. Put it in and lasted a few days, then the phone would not work. I wont know what the real problem is till I get to LA and have it checked out."
2,Batteries for phone,Does not seem like a new battery. Did not hold the charge as long as the one I replaced it with
5,Very good item,"It was very good item,quality and acceptable price, too.I can recommend this for everyone, why not.Thank you soVasil Xh."
3,OK price for the product,It works but does not hold charge for more than two days with light use. I wish the battery is a fresh product.
1,"Garbage... but for #2, why not try",I'm very disappointed in the performance of these units.I think they were rejects from the factory production runs.They don't hold a charge worth a darn.
2,Doesn't hold a charge as well as expected,"Not much more to say, the phone doesn't get much use and we feel it should hold a charge longer based on how the original battery we got with the phone performed."
5,Amazing.,"I was amazed because I actually thought, companies make a lot ofmoney on the replacement batteries for products (this is the casefor instance with cordless power tools). This one is really cheapand works like the one that was in the phone when it was new. Oneweek until recharge with about two to three few-minute calls perday."
1,Never got the package!,I ordered from this company and I NEVER got the package! I will never order from this company again. Amazon had to give my money back.
1,Doesn't hold charge well,I bought this battery to replace the original (probably 8 yr. old). This new one doesn't hold a charge any longer than the original. Not a good purchase.
5,good choice,"I'm glad to have a friend that suggested this site for batteries, my other one I was charging 5 times a day and now with this new one I only have to charge my phone every couple of days before use."
3,Great used battery,"The battery works just fine, but they advertise it as new, and that is not true. In the receipt I received in the mail, it was listed as used, differently than the website says."
1,Not Satisfied,Slim Li Ion Battery for the Motorola RAZR V3This battery was purchased new through Amazon. It does not hold a charge more then two days even with the phone turned off during the overnight hours. It took my old battery more then a year to do that ! You get what you pay for !!I give this battery one star ( A Poor Value ).
1,This battery is as bad as the one I have for three years,"This battery is so disappointing. The first day it was good, and then next morning, completely out, and the cell phone is down. It can never last two days. I am hoping to get a replacement, but just do not want to deal with the shipping/returning for a small item."
1,V3 slim battery,This is the 2nd battery I have ordered in the last couple of months and neither one will last all day without recharging. I am very disappointed with the performance of your product.
3,"THere's worse, bad, ok, good, and the best. THIS ONE IS OK.","Well, i got the battery fast, its cheap. But buying it cheap has its consequences i guess, When I put the batt, my phone got messed up. Now my phone turns off on its own, then goes back on. As if it had some virus in it. Well but right now im still using it. it works but i have lots of problem with my phone after i put on this battery: Shuts off and on automatically, MY number 4 wont work, they said its the phone not the battery, actually before it would dial on its own--but it doesnt do that anymore.But over all, the battery last long (batt life). ANd I got it for 7 bucks, to me, im using my phone and the battery. It's all gud.Fast shipping. ordered at night, and the next day or two it came. IT was fast. THanks."
4,I am pleased,I received my item in a very timely manner and it was in terrific condition. Works great and I am very satisfied.
2,Very weak battery life,"Extremely low battery life with this replacement battery. Need to charge every day at least once. Reaches a half life extremely quick, probably 3 months or so."
1,bait and switch,company sent a BR50 which has a lower MAH rating. sure it fit but it was not the battery listed and thus not the battery i purcahsed. notified seller that it was bait and switch and seller gave a full refund.
1,used not new,"This is the second time I post a review on this item, the first time it got deleted don't know why, the thing is that this battery was suposed to be new, and it came in a little plastic bag with obvious signs or usage.It won't hold charge,and for the ones saying this batteries won't hold charge even when new, well the first one i had, could hold it, for over 3 days, so no.Any way, just steer clear from this one, and search something else.Hope this doesn't get deleted this time.Dr. Munoz"
2,"Great Price, Bad shipping","The product is new and the price is great (5 stars). My only problem was the shipping (1 star). They ship with the Postal Service. The Postal service has the worst tracking service. My other issue was that I e-mailed the seller several different times about the shipping. I still have not heard anything from the seller(0 Stars). The price was great, but the lack of contact from the seller would make me think twice about buying from them. It took about 2 weeks to get the battery."
4,Replacement battery,"Slim Li Ion battery for my RAZR V3 works well, I wish the charge lasted longer though."
4,Good replacement at four month mark.,"This battery has performed well over the last several months. I purchased two batteries for two RAZR's. One RAZR is used about two hours a day and holds a charge for two days easily. The other is used about two hours a week with a Bluetooth headset and holds a charge for about four days.I have noticed a slight decline in the ability to hold a charge when constantly used with the Bluetooth headset. The batteries were manufactured in May 2006 so they were only about 4 months old when I got them. The original batteries supplied with the phones lasted for 18 months but the last three or four months required constant charging.For the price, I'll be satisfied with one year of good use. I thought about stocking up, but decided that unless I was willing to constantly rotate the batteries, it would not be worth it."
5,Perfect transaction,"Nothing dramtic to report (that's good).The purchase went smoothly, procuct was shipped quickly, and works as expected.A+ rating"
2,doesn't really hold a charge...,"although it said it was a factory replacement for my phone, the V3xx, it doesn't fit quite right, and it doesn't hold a charge overnight if the phone is left on...Just not sure about the quality of these motorola batteries..."
1,Piece of Junk,The battery held even less of a charge than the battery it was replacing. I have switched back to the original. I lost two bars of charge in less than an hour and only talked on the phone for 20 minutes. Not worth the effort or the $10.
1,Motorola Li Ion Battery for RAZR V3,"The battery was advertised as new and at a very low price. However, the battery I was replacing holds a charge longer than the two new batteries I purchased. I bought two batteries because the price seem too good to be true, and it was. I should have known better, and now you do! Don't purchase these batteries."
3,Razor battery,"The batterys i purchased seem to be in good condition. Overall ALL RAZOR bateries have a short life, so i would suggest buying at least 2 at a time."
1,Lousy,Bought two of these batteries. One came discharged and wouldn't take a charge.The second would charge but only last one day in standby. If you used the phone it would last only a few minutes. I called the vendor who sent two replacements. They both last about 2 days in standby. These things are junk. Don't throw your money away.
1,battery will not hold charge gtrayer than 24 hours,"Batteries are very poor quality. Web page shows up to 300 hours standby but will only hold up to 24 hours on stand by. Have sent several emails to SF Planet requesting if they stock an extended battery for the Motorola razr v3 GSM, cingular. I am still waiting on a reply. They have issued an RMA number but before I return I have rrquested an inquiry if they stock the extended battery. If they do not I will try someone else."
4,Good replacement battery,Good battery so far; lasts just as long as the original battery when it was new.
3,1 of the two batteries 'worked' as a new battery should.,"SUPER price, Fast shipping, and 1 of the two batteries 'worked' as a new battery should.I received two batteries, one worked GREAT and one worked WORSE than the battery being replace, standby time a few hours, talk time? Minimal at best."
2,it lasted only till i charged 2 times,the battery was fine between the first two charges after that was holding only for a day or so still better than the old battery but i expect in 3 mounts it's gonna die
2,Razr V3c Replacement Battery,The batteries don't have any more life than the batteries being replaced. At least I have an affordable replacement to put in each day or day and a half.
1,Motorola Lithium Ion Cell phone battery,This battery did absolutely no good. My Motorola cell phone battery still will not hold a charge. I get one 30-minute call and then the phone battery is dead. Did not work for me at all.
3,"""Fantastic"" documentary about Rock Hudson","A masterpiece about comedy, a perfect complement for ""Pillow Talk"" and other Rock Hudson's comedies. Here, Rappaport make a editing from Rock Hudson's movies of all times, selecting scenes that suggest you the homosexuality of the star/charachter. Very funny, for all Rock Hudson's lovers/fans and people without prejudices."
1,"Great concept, poor execution...","When I bought ""Rock Hudson's Home Movies,"" I was expecting an irreverent, insightful memory play based on the life and work of the titular movie hunk from Hollywood's Golden Age. Apparently it was intended as such, but shoddy video techniques, poor acting, and glaring ommissions (like Hudson's most gay- subtextual scenes in ""A Very Special Favor"") made this one a huge let-down. The actor portraying Hudson is wooden, his narration a string of barely-audible pot shots delivered in a manner most unlike the charismatic Rock. Those interested in this subject, however, may want to check out ""The Celluloid Closet"" by Vito Russo!"
4,Weak Flash ruins an otherwise great camera,"Have used it for 1 1/2 years. Bought it here on Amazon. Have used it at parties, kid events, etc. It's been banged around and used for thousands of shots.One thing really ruins it...The flash on this unit is abysmal. The slow lens prevents available light photography. Don't expect to light up a family group shot with it.Otherwise, the camera has it all... The other reviews pretty much cover it."
3,good size ok pics,"I bought this camera based on the quality of Olympus. I really love the size. I usually don't us the 4meg setting since it uses alot of the memory, but it is good for snapshots. I personally think that a 35mm point and shoot gives better pics, but if the person blinks you don't know until 2wks later. The Digital Camera give you an instant view. The computer jpegs look better than my prints off the printer, but it maybe my printer. The focus on the stylus is alittle slow, but good camera. Update 1.5 years later it broke had to buy new camera since motor went out until then was working good and printing the pics at photo center came out great. xd card kinda expensive, too"
2,"Some good features, but","The Stylus 400 is attractive because of it's 4 megapixel resolution, the weather resistant case, and it's small size. All very attractive if you enjoy the outdoors and want your camera with you.However, be aware that the low light sensitivity means that you will often be using slow shutter speeds and will need a tripod or other support. You also might expect that a camera with this price and pixel resolution would have some more advanced features. However, this is a point and shoot camera only.Compare to the Canon S50 at a similar price."
2,Decent camera; don't believe the 1-year warranty,"This camera takes good pictues in well-lit, close-up situations--a good point & shoot camera.I have a major complaint with Olympus' failure to honor the 1-year warranty on this product. A plastic component of the USB port broke, rendering the USB port useless. Olympus refused to honor the warranty for this repair, despite repeated requests from both me and the camera shop where I purchased the camera.Also, the ""metal body"" description of this camera does not apply to the media door--it is plastic, and prone to breakage.I own about 15 cameras. This was my first Olympus, and based on their failure to honor the warranty, it will be my last."
2,Pricey & not the best camera!,"Nice design and good looking. (Although not yet stylish as Canon Elph's.) Good battery life but the extra battery costs a lot. You can't put in AA batteries in this one.Average image quality indoors. Good outdoors. Slow to focus and has annoying shutter lag. No manual features and many photos need to be tweaked in photoshop. Video mode is junk.Uses propreitary xD cards...Back to the camera, its a good attempt by Olympus but still way behind Canon, Sony, Pentax, Nikon and Minolta..."
2,Would not recommend this to anyone...,"After purchasing this camera I found out how poorly it shoots indoors or close-ups. When not using the flash, all images are blurry, even when mounted on a stable surface. For those photographers that do rely on manual controls this camera is not right for you. I'm still upset that I spent this much money on a camera that can't take decent pictures."
4,What about being weatherproof?,"I have not bought yet, but this is my primary consideration for this little beauty!"
2,poor quality pictures,"The design of the camera, the metal case, size, weather-proofing are excellent. It's still my favorite. However the quality of pictures both indoors and outside are horrible. The camera over compensates for dark or light situations. A beautiful day with a nice blue sky is captured by either making the sky very white, or the subject (trees, house, etc) very dark. The camera is being returned because of the poor quality. It's a real bummer because I like everything else about the camera.Updated 10/21/03 -- Purchased the Canon Powershot S400 to replace. What a great camera!!!! The Canon takes excellent pictures right out of the box. About the same size, but no weatherproofing. Much better camera for the money!!"
1,Terrible Vocals,"Before you read this review, let me tell you I am a huge fan of the NEW ALOL(Hunter). I had this album before Hunter was released and absolutely hate this album. The vocals are terrible compared to the vocals on hunter. If you have ever played Doom3, and you listen to this album, you may notice that the singer sounds exactly like the Revenants. In my opinion, thats really annoying, and listening to this album gives me a headache. Even if you try to follow along by reading the lyrics, trust me, you will get lost.The only reason i give this album any stars is because i love the guitar riff in the first song ""Joan said Please"", and because i like the bands name...So, take my advice, Pass up this album and just buy Hunter."
4,The new slayer,"This is the sound form the God Hates Us All album and even with the return of the old drummer, it seems the sound will stay. Im not complaining cause I love the raw anger of the ""new slayer."" Although this wasnt as good as God Hates Us All its was still awesome."
3,Another great offering from the Rolling Stones of metal,"The good:Flesh StormCatalystJihadCultBlack SerenadeThese are the best songs on the cd, the ""climax"" if you will are Jihad and Cult..both have a antireligious taste. ""Jihad"" is the ""Angel Of Death"" of this generationthe Bad:CatatonicEyes of The INsaneconsfearacyThese songs, especially Eyes of The INsane show why it's Kerry King and Jeff Hannenmen who write most of the lyrics. the lyrics in ""Eyes"" are silly...however, I love the duel lead guitar work. Catatonic is just simply annoyingI didnt like Consfearecy because I'm not too big on bands that get all political, but besides that, the song is greatthe other reviewers confuse me...calling this NU metal? please!my only wish is that this band would go back to lyrics with more intellegence such as ""Seasons In The Abyss"" album had...but overall, I love this CD and this band"
2,Heavy doesn't always mean great!,"This is a fast dark album that is really heavy, but its quite generic. It seems like it was thrown together. There isn't much that stands out, except the wanna be AC/DC intro in one of the songs. I was strongly displeased with this album. Granted its not as bad as the last 3 albums, but pretty close."
1,nothing new ...after 5 years...no WoW,"the only star goes to Lombardo coming back to town...even not comparable to Steve Asheim of deicide. i think these guys have to disband and do some solo business to gain more experience...there are no riffs at all it is just a noise,..come on guys play that damn guitars., hey you Kerry you had 5 years...Tom sorry for your voice getting terrible...do some research on your roots... i mean back to where you came from. season in the Abyss or south of heaven were the epics for you guys you can do it! and you are musicians and not METALICA..."
4,Slayeriffic!,"""Religion is rape. Religion is obscene. Religion'sa whore!""So says Slayer on the track ""Cult"". Of course,Mr. Ainsworth told us pretty much the same thing oneSpring morning on the way to a Peewee Soccer game. ButMr. Ainsworth was driving a station wagon, he smokedMores, and had a scalp-showing-flat-top. His deliverylacked frisson. Slayer, god bless 'em, has built acareer on god-hating frisson. Of course, at this pointthe guys could be Mr. Ainsworth, all beefy men intheir mid-forties. But they haven't reached their""Hello, Cleveland""moment yet. Monster cuts like""Supremist"" and ""Jihad"" deliver old schoolmayhem like a kick to the yarbles -- thanks in nosmall part to the return of the double-bass fury oforiginal drummer Dave Lombardo. So, up with Satan! Wehave a solid, if predictable, Slayer product."
1,TOTAL CRAP!,"Anyone that loves ""Diablous in Musica"" or ""God Hates us All"" will be dissapointed with this cd. Whenever a band takes a long time off and try to make a come back with new album it blows. For example bands usualy say it took them long time to write tracks/record ,they spent lots of hours on the album and whenever you hear ""Most effort they ever put in to this whole project"" it translates to we're running out of original ideas and the whole CD is gonna be crap. This cd it looked like they made in week or two, the quaility of the sound is sooo damn shiity, if a rendom band from the street would bring their demo it would of probably sound a alot better. None of the tracks stand out and it's gotta be the worse cd Slayer ever made. I think it's that time for Slayer to finally retire or just tour but don't put out any more crap like this."
3,Poor For Slayer's Standards....,"For any standards of metal this is a good album. For Slayers standards, it sucks. Tom's vocals sometimes sound like there's no emotion. The guitars are tight as usual. As far as drums are concerned, Lombardo is still back in 1986 which is a good thing. I just can't get into the vocals. Example, ""Eyes of the Insane"" Tom tries to sound sick and well, insane. But it just isn't convincing. Sometimes you can tell he's just yelling things without actually ""feeling"" them. Maybe if he wrote more of the lyrics...good metal album, ok Slayer album. I doubt they'll ever top God Hates Us All."
5,Slayer's best album in a LONG time!!,"It seems to me the original Slayer lineup has motivated these guys to stray away from the God Hates and Diabolous sounds and back to the good ol' days where Slayer reigned upon the thrash metal throne...Dave Lombardo coming back to Slayer is more than a blessing...every song on this cd reminds me of something Slayer could've put out in the 80's and early 90's....Christ Illusion is chock full of Slayer's best riffs, drumming, and Tom Araya's screamed vocals...Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman shred their guitars like always while Dave Lombardo shows why he is called "" The Human Drum Machine""....Slayer is back with a mean vengeance and shows that a band 25 years old can still put out good albums even if the band members are in their 40's....Christ Illusion is a definitive comeback to the old skool and better Slayer...will not dissapoint long time fans!!!"
3,Ehh. . .,"""Jihad"" is a brutal song, but the CD is so just average that although it would have been great from someone else, it just isn't the least bit impressive from Slayer. The lyrics are generally unimaginative and the music is remarkably formulaic. God Hates Us All was far more brutal, aggressive, and imaginative than Christ Illusion. Is it just me, or are ""Jesus sucks"" and ""Christianity sucks"" lyrics just getting boring or what?"
2,"i agree, this album sound lazy","kerry king needs to quit writing lyrics. he also needs to stop listening to sum 41. i've been awaiting the return o flombardo for years and i was completely dissapointed to hear his glorious talent ruined by kerry king. slayer used to to have lyrics that would make you think, now the lyrics just make me think about turning off the cd and putting in an older album. if this is the music they are going to be making, perhaps its time for slayer to bow out gracefully and retire instead of ruining what they've already done."
5,It's like falling in love for the first time all over again...,"The best album in years! A great mix of the old and new styles. Fast, aggressive, loud, very catchy. These riffs and lyrics stick in my head for hours after I listen. Good diversity in lyrical content, but still has some of the Jesus, religion, God sucks stuff. Any Slayer fan of any era will definitely find something appealing on this album. Highly recommnended!"
4,Slayer's best since Seasons,"Definitely Slayer's best album since Seasons in the Abyss. In my opinion, the previous few albums were, for the most part, crap. Presumably Lombardo's return played a big part in making this album a success. As a Catholic, I find much of the subject matter here offensive and misleading-- but, then again, I never listened to Slayer to ""learn"" anything. Their anti-religion, pro-Satan stances are tiresome and affected. Fortunately, I can think for myself, so as far as I am concerned they can continue with this ""schtick"" as long as they continue to make good music."
5,Very good comeback!!,like I said before...Dave Lombardo has officially saved this band. His return to Slayer marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. This album proves it. After listening to the first minute of the opening track I knew I was in for something amazing!Buy this album you wont regret it.
4,Intense!,"This is the first Slayer album I have owned. I bought it on a whim but I'm not unhappy that I did. The intensity of this record is amazing. The drumming is particularly remarkable. I really cannot believe that a human being can play that fast and accurately. The rest of the band are equally proficient with their instruments. Incredible energy throughout! My only 'issue' with the disc is the monomaniac lyrical subject matter. I get that they don't dig organised religion, but why go on and on about it? Why can't we have more songs like Eyes of the Insane, which is really cool and topical. This whole satanic thing is real dull and boring. I have other records by bands who are into satanism (Down, for one) but they at least mix it up a bit and also sing about other things (their love of weed, for example). Dudes, the music shreds but the lyrics are pretty juvenile for guys well into their 30s (judging by the pics). Other than that, it rocks."
3,"A good album -> 3,5 stars",This album is a little better than a classic average album. If you like Slayer you will like this album too (but not so much as their previous works). The production is good but there are no tracks to make the difference. Its a little better than just ok . If you are new to Slayer check Seasons in the Abyss - Diabolus in musica - South of Heaven -> which are very very good albums and of course my favorites of Slayer
4,Nice return to form,You won't waste your money on this one. It's a good solid Slayer offering. A nice return to form after several lesser efforts. I'm not gonna be too specific here. It's probably their best since Seasons in the Abyss. And better than World Painted Blood.
4,Corpsegrinder?,"This album roars with a vengence. Come one, how can you take a review seriously when the writer call himself ""Corpsegrinder?"" What are you, in Avenged Sevenfold?"
3,Disappointed.,"In my opinion, the new Slayer CD is nothing more than average. There are a few songs that are just too fast, the guitar soloing VARIES LITTLE from the King/Hanneman of the past decade, and I feel kind of embarrased that these guys are still singing about Satan; it's cool and everything when you're young, but come-on, these guys are in their late forties already. GHUA has a much better sound and better riffs. After five years of waiting, I expected something much better.But... I heard a band titled ""Demiricous"" that sounds like Slayer, only much, much better. They are somewhat unknown - give them a try @ www.demiricous.com"
1,every song sounds alike,"this is just an average album, nothing special. if you want good slayer buy Reign In Blood. not this"
1,Just another metal album,"I guess Slayer has joined the ranks of nearly every metal and rock band. Nothing but a bunch of anti-American, liberal B.S.I mean, good grief, there song jihad... you'd think by slayer being an American metal band they would rip apart osma or some machmoud, mohammed or whatever. But no, of course not. The last line in that song is ""when you have reached ground zero you will have killed the enemy, the great satan."" For any of you that don't know, ""the great satan"" is what Iran, and any other mohammed country, calls America. So F slayer... they missed the calling. I, however, did not."
1,sucks,"this album is the worst album in the world, i dont know why i bough it, it sounds like people banging things that make noise, and theres no melody, all the songs sound the same. id rather listen to killswitch engage, the man acctually screams, roars, growls, and can sing, yea...acctually sing! never heard that from this album. i had to give it 1 star, if u like metal, listen 2 judas priest, old school metallica, killswitch engage, shadows fall, pantera, old sepultura, blind guardian, demon hunter, megadeth, unearth, and ozzy, leave junk like this alone. i will give slayer some credit...THEY HAVE NOT SOLD OUT. thats it...they havent stoped making pathetic music, theres my 2 cents, i bought it, im reviewing it, i know alot of you are pissed, so i wont even come back on this slayer page again, there you go."
1,WARNNG! This is the noisiest garbage metal band on the Earth!,"Here is what I've expected from this crappy band they keep making incoeherent noise with idiotic ""Hail Satan, F**king Jesus Christ, blood/death everywhere, I kill your family and eat your flesh!"" etc. lyrics like ever before. Its a wonder how can they do it for 20 years... You must be an idiotic s**t-minded retard with an IQ of zero to like this. F**k Slayer and their fans!I agree with this ""donkey"" guy below, Slayer is the WORST metal band ever. For good real metal, check out some of those bands he listed. I hope Slayer will die painfully soon and their fans will commit suicide."
1,Posing...,"This band is one of those bands that are scared to sing about something sensible about. They got bad stuff in their lyrics, and that's their way of trying to be tough. Mature, talented bands like Norma Jean, Demis of Eros, are tougher bands becaue they aren't afraid to sing what is logical and makes sense. Bands like the last stated are strong and fearless like who they worship: God. Other bands like Slayer try to gain a ""tough"" reputation by trying to be a rebel. I would stick to bands that aren't scared."
1,GARBAGE,This New release is just plain garbage...I agree with you Corpsegrinder.As a die-hard Slayer fan..The band did die after Seasons..
1,nah,"swlayer is one of those bands that is like a roach they just dont go away theyve made like 20 albums and still havent made it repetitive guitar and drums all albums sound the same give it up slayer your not going to make it just not that great of a band people need to understand that 5 4.5 stars means the album is rated a classis not you like them so give them 5 if this album was a classic it would have at least sold 500,000 copies not under 100,000"
4,Dave Lombardo Is Back!,"This is first Slayer album since SEASONS IN THE ABYSS with the drummer DAVE LOMBARDO who is one of the greatest drummers in metal. Still, I think I was a little bit disapponted because all of the songs in this album aren't as good as in GOD HATES US ALL which was one of the greatest albums ever made. There's great songs - just as ""Jihad"", ""Catatonic"" etc. which sound really angry - very aggressive! In fact the only songs I don't like so much are ""Catalyst"" and ""Consfearacy"" but that may be that I have only listened to this album seven times. I really think I have to listen to this more, and not just because of I can say it's perfect. I listen to it because I like it.Stars: Cult, Jihad, Eyes of the Insane"
5,Slatanic Slayer rules!,"Wow, I was blown away from the first note to the last. God hates us all was awesome but this is taking Slayer to a new level!"
2,This is terrible,"As a long time Slayer fan from the 80's, I will agree that this album is their best since ""Seasons.."". But it does not compare to Seasons, it's just merely ""the best since"". Musically it's decent. There are thrash songs on it however this is not a ""thrash album"".The lyrics on these songs are just downright awful. There was obviosuly no time taken or thinking through with the creative process of these lyrics AND the way they are delivered. Tom is just yelling words bluntly!! You mean to tell me this is all they came up with in 5 years? IN 5 YEARS since their last release? If anything the lyrics on this album sound like they were just trying to make studio deadlines...The only reason I'm giving this album 2 stars is to show that it is set apart from God Hates Us All and Diabolous."
1,"Brutal, not in a good way","yes, very brutal, slayer has earned the new monicker nu-slayer that seems to be all the rage these days . This new one is even a step below the last one. weak from beginning to end. Luckily we still have the new Sodom and Destruction albums to fill our thrash needs"
5,SLAYER still rules,"Album of the year!Back with a vengeance and some new tunes that will become classics. Its not Reign In Blood but comes close to the intensity. If you like Slayer, you should have had this a long time ago.See them live when they come, nobody else will compare after"
4,This is why Slayer are THE thrash metal reference,"Finally, Slayer have picked up where they left off after ""Seasons in the Abyss"". This is the real deal. Listen to this album and hear why Slayer are fanatically revered the world over and for decades by bands and fans alike."
3,average Slayer output,"What more needs to be said that hasn't already? Yeah, Slayer is back but with this ""return to the original lineup"" I was hoping for more grip Inc like drumming from Lombardo and somemore innovation on the guitar rythms and vocal placement. After making fans wait so long each time for albums these are way too short. after repeated listens God hates us all simply rages compared to this. The lyrics read like they were written in front of the TV. Still.....who can pummel heavier than Slayer? i saw them on the Unholy Alliance tour and they played a killer set list and will always be Thrash titans."
4,THE MASTERS ARE BACK AND LOUDER THAN HELL!!!!!,"That's right, I said MASTERS, because I beleive that Slayer invented THRASH/DEATH METAL. Although some claim that Venom did, I would have to dissagree. This album brings the original members back for the attack and also dips back to the mid 80's/early 90's awesome Slayer sound. Hell, just by reading the old style, devil-worship lyrics you think that if GOD sees you that you will be struck by lightning! Of course nowadays there are darker, louder, metal bands-but will they stand the test of time like Slayer? I highly doubt it. This album is only about 38 minutes long but you will not be disappointed. Just think of it as a quicker way to start back at the beginning and blow your eardrums out all over again! Rock on and keep true metal alive-Just buy it!"
4,Christ reissued,"Slayer makes up for releasing two versions of the same album less than a year apart with some nice additions that will please the hardcore fan, this edition contains two additional tracks and a bonus DVD.Pros:* Cool artwork* ""The Final Six"" and the new version of ""Black serenade"" worth it.* ""Eyes of the Insane"" music video makes the bonus DVD worth the watchCons:* Many fans will wonder why Slayer couldn't have released the two versions at the same time, and not enough reasons to buy this new edition.* Only small differences between the two versions of ""Black Serenade""Overall, the special edition of Christ Illusion is worth the pickup if you're a hardcore fan or haven't yet bought the original."
4,Darker and faster,"I thought I could not get used to the faster, more in-your-face singing of Tom Araya. In almost punk-like rhythm, Araya lays down lyrics that clearly state the subject. Nothing is abstract. This is what I like.However, punk may be an overstatement as the singing is more melodic in Catatonic and Consfearacy - two of my favorites.Overall, it took a few listens to realize the intensity of Christ Illusion. But it proved worthwhile to sit through some less favorable songs as they each presented unique qualities. Christ Illusion seems to speak the minds of those looking outside at the complicated world of religion."
3,Will Jeff Hanneman Please Take this band back ??,"I tried to love this CD because it is the return of Dave Lombardo but it just leaves almost NO impression on me. Kerry King has been writing most of the Slayer material for the past decade and quite frankly I think it is dry and uninteresting. Jeff Hanneman was the driving force behind the great days of Slayer and I don't know if he is just getting bored with the band or if he has lost his magic for writing great songs. Jeff has abondoned most of the song writing leaving King in charge. Sorry Kerry, but you are a subpar song writer at best. Your lyrics are juvenile and your wah guitar leads are annoying. I have a feeling that unless Jeff Hanneman gets inspired to write some new material we are doomed to listen to Kerry King's C level version of Slayer. JEFF WHERE ARE YOU????"
2,Dr. Suess's classic portrayed badly.,"""The Grinch"" offers very little to the audience other than overwhelming visual candy.A few comments:~ Many people went to the movie to see Jim Carey. Unfortunately that is all the audience saw in the Grinch, Jim Carey. The producers let Carey use too much of his own persona which only served to overshadow the character of the Grinch.~ The movie relied too much on visual tricks and make-up versus a solid script and plot, this immensely takes away from the storyline.~ I highly doubt that Dr. Suess intended for the story to contain gross humor i.e. belching, farting, etc...Overall, I found the movie to be less than appealing.Take your family out to a different movie, your time will be better spent."
1,BAD! NOT recommended to kids!,"I can't believe they took a good classic into something SOOO dumpy! First of all, this should be a kids movie, but the language, the jokes, etc is adult. The story is just terrible.If I'm not mistaken, I thought the original story was, that the Whos didnt care for presents, but being together as one, being like a large family.In the beginning of the movie, they're talking about presents as being the important thing for Christmas.NOT recommended for kids, due to language, adult jokes, scenes they play, etc.NOT recommended to anyone, due to a bad story, bad jokes, dull gross parts."
1,too big a dose of Jim Carrey,"Ugh. Too much unfunny Jim Carrey. I haven't laughed at him since his days on ""In Living Color"", which was hilarious. I can't reconcile this mean-spirited travesty with the original except for some of the Seuss dialogue showing up. Skip it."
1,A movie that shouldn't exist,"Normally I enjoy Ron Howard films, but in this case he should have left well enough alone. ""The Grinch"" was just fine being only a half hour cartoon, thank you. Since I can't say anything nice about Jim Carrey, I won't say anything at all."
5,The Grinch,"I love the original cartoon AND this one directed by Ron Howard. Great story, actors, costuming, make up... just fun."
5,arrived safely,It is a good movie to watch for the holidays. Had the video but the machine ate it. So I decided to get the dvd
5,Favorite Xmas movie,I love this remake. It's done so well. The movie is funny and heartfelt. I watch it every christmas day.
4,A true delight!,"If you ever thought to yourself ""I love the Grinch, but 26 minutes isn't enough!"" then you'll be delighted by Ron Howard's masterpiece, Dr. Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The extra 60 or so minutes of adventure feature great moments such as the origin of the Grinch and the story of why he hates Christmas. Young or old, it doesn't matter. This is a Grinch everyone can enjoy!"
4,Jim Carey great,Great movie Jim Carey classic. Watch this every year around holidays. Good laughs and a good story. A must see.
5,Tops em all!,This is such a good movie for christmas.ItBrings out the christmas spirit! This movieyou can watch over and over and over again withoutgetting bord. Every time you just get more excited!
1,sacrilege,"As someone who worshiped the original animated version of this film, I can only say that this film has irrevocably soiled the image of Dr. Suess. In my opinion, this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If I could snap my fingers and make this terrible film go away forever, I would, in a heartbeat. Shame on you Opie!!"
1,"The Critic says it all, ""It Sux!!""","Here I thought this movie was going to be an instant classic. Boy was I wrong. First of all the movie strts out well and goes down hill from there. I mean the ending isn't even the original one that we have all grown to love. Another thing the little girl gets sooooo annoying, I can't look at her any more. In the end this movie was horrible and too slow to even allow me to finish it. Enjoy!!"
3,"Love Jim, but not the film","I am a huge fan of Jim Carreys work. This is the first film Ive seen of a Grinch of any kind and Im sure the Grinch was a bit meaner than this. Anyways its an ok Holiday film. Ill be keeping it because of Jim, but honestly its too much ""fantasy"" for my taste."
1,"Longing for picture quality, fair warning","Regardless of how you feel about this movie (yes, I like it a lot), the upconverting of the standard DVD is not sufficient for me. In my search for information regarding the blu-ray release, I've found that the blu-ray is does the picture quality no justice. I use Blu-ray.com as a source of information and based on their review, I won't be buying the BD until someone improves it.[...]."
4,At least I know why the Grinch is the way he is,"I enjoyed the movie, but I was a bit unhappy with some of it. At least I found out why the Grinch is/was the way he is/was.I thought that was a nice touch to the movie. Gave the Grinch more of a past so we could ""understand"" him. The Who's were nice, but I loved Cindy Lou Who's mom and the Whovier lady who competed at Christmas. Those lights! I guess I had hoped the Grinch, as played by Jim Carrey, would be a bit more Grinchy, but he wasn't. That disappointed me. Perhaps I need to watch it again to see what I missed the first time around. Do watch it. It is very pretty and the Whos are such a nice bunch."
3,UNIMPRESSIVE !! - LACKING EXTRAS,"Let me start with the good or at least the acceptable. The picture and sound quality are what you've come to expect from a mid-level HD-DVD catalog title. Picture quality isn't ""stunning"" like some other releases, but it is obviously a hi-def dvd. The sound quality is average. The DTS soundtrack is only available on the regular dvd side. The bad comes when you expect to see the same extras that were included in the original ""collector's edition"". Gone are the bloopers, deleted scenes, videos & documentaries, in fact the only real extra is a directors commentary with Ron Howard. In a word PATHETIC !! Universal seems to be trying to become the new FOX, expensive products with no value added features, my advice.....save up for the double dip."
4,Family Favorite,"This is a great family movie. I watch it with my grandchildren and they LOVE it as much as I do. I also own the original animated version and we watch both of them and enjoy both. There is a great lesson taught in the story while we are entertained. It has enough ""adult"" humor to keep us older folks chuckling and enough fun for the kiddies to keep them laughing too. I think the kids get the message that Christmas isn't just about the decorations and gifts but about sharing it with the people they love. Dr. Seuss was a master story teller and having his story presented in this wonderful holiday movie is a way I really enjoy spending quality time with the little ones!"
1,Not Good,"I don't know where the numerous praises saying that this movie was good for kids came from. I'm a kid and I hated it. Compared to Jim Carrey's previous work, this movie barely had a serious moment and wasn't even funny. The extras that they added were gross and juvenile. I'm not Carrey's biggest fan, but some of his comedic talent are bizzarely hilarious. This isn't one of those moments, though."
1,I want my money BACK!!!,"I just bought the video of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and all I can say is I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was horrified by the entire movie. It was like the Mask only with a Christmas theme and no gangsters. This is a shining example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood. A big budget and scads of special effects do NOT make a good movie. In this case it didn't even make a decent movie. This movie lacked all the charm, humor, and fun of the original. It is by no means endearing as the original is and always will be. And the original, made with the simplest, purest, truest form of animation will remain beloved and treasured while I would like to fling my copy of the new one into a toxic waste dump. I am sure that Dr. Seuss is rolling over in his grave. My kids weren't even mildly humored by this movie. I gave this movie one star because there is no option to give it the big NONE that it deserves."
5,Amazing,"I really love this version of the classic story. Jim Carrey is fabulous as the mean, but lovable Grinch, and Taylor Momsen does a great job as the sweet Cindy Lou Who.The sets are elaborate and the makeup and wardrobe really make the people of Whoville come to life. After so many years of reading the story and watching the original movie, this movie allows viewers to see the ""real"" Whoville.I think this is a must-buy for all Christmas movie lovers!"
4,He's a mean one.,"One of Jim Carrey's most unusual roles, but any Dr Suess fan will love this. Even Carrey's version of the unforgettable song is fabulous."
1,Stupid pack peaple,"First of allA. Packs are idiots disguised for money.B. this is no goody, the two movies are bad.The cat says ""Son of b*****"" in this movie.something everyone should know is this is bad."
2,"Kids will love it, I didn't","Jim Carrey is amusing for only about a minute but after that, I can't stand him. Kids will probably get a kick out of Carrey's antics and his constant mugging for the camera. I for one will always be a fan of the original Chuck Jones cartoon with Boris Karloff's memorable narration. Making a live action film from a cartoon CAN be worthwhile, but this one didn't work for me."
2,Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas DVD,"DVD was used, only lets me play on one DVD player, surround sound DVD says ""Disk Error"". This is the only DVD we have had problems with."
2,VVVVVVVeeeeeryyyyyy Goooooooood!!!!!,"I think the How the Grinch Stole X-mas was an exceptionally good movie.I think alot of it is histarical and I laugh alot during it. Except there is one part(which I really don't care to mention I think brings it down one star),but if you just FF it it's really a very funny and great movie!!!!!"
1,THIS MOVIE STUNK,"Luckily I saw this in a dollar theatre. I was so excited that this was coming out and of all people Jim Carrey how could the movie be bad. Well the sad part is it is. It is not funny, boring and I fell asleep"
1,Just Stick With Cat In The Hat.,"IF I WERE A 14 YEAR OLD I MIGHT JUST ENJOY THIS TRAVESTY.WHEN I WAS YOUNG, WE'D GO SEE A MOVIE AT THE IMAX THEATER IN HOUSTAN. AND THE PREVEIW FOR THE MOVIE CAME UP. IT WAS A TOTAL FRIGHT. STICK WITH MIKE MYERS: THE CAT IN THE HAT. HE'S THE DR. SEUSS CHARACTER WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE."
1,BEWARE!!!!,"Well first off I believe this DVD is coming from Canada.. Which is cool, except for the fact that it took maybe a MONTH to be delivered !!!!! That alone had me pissed off, then to put the icing on the cake after playing it a few times it, Pauses, Freezes, jumps like if it's totally scratched!!! So No this grinch movie is NOT getting a good review from me,'matter of fact it's not the movie it's the whole company they got going on there!!! So BEWARE u might as well pay the $2-3 extra bucks for the original made in USA store or even walmart bought !!!"
3,Wanting joy,"Tried watching this with my grandson, but had to skip parts - I wanted a fun movie to watch and this had a lot of focus on darkness."
3,It's a good show for the kids.,"If you're like ,e you like a good Christmas story like the next guy but this is one of those types of movies to watch once and be done with. Carrey is a good actor and did a god job but I could not stand to watch it again."
3,Not really Dr. Seuss.,"Funny in places, but pretty different from Dr. Seuss' tale. Probably good for the middle-elementary or middle school crowd, but my 1st grader didn't like it."
4,A Must Have Holiday Movie,"""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" is one of those animated classics you watch every chirstmas to put you in the holiday spirit, or at least I do. ""The Grinch"" with Jim Carrey is definately one movie I will add to my list of must watch christmas movies (gotta love ""National Lampoons Christmas Vacation"")""The Grinch"" has a different story line than the original to keep your intrest yet it keeps the same philosopy so you still have the sence of the old one.The people and their hair and clothes are amazing. The houses and all the props are done well and artisticly. I could watch the movie on mute just to see this but of course there are so many good lines to laugh at you can't do that.Bottom line 1-like Jim Carrey? 2-like the original grinch? 3-want a funny clean christmas movie? yes yes and yes = a must buy!"
2,3rd day of christmas 2011 review,"On the 3rd day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...The live action remake of The Grinch. The sets are poor at best. The camera work is awful. Jim Carrey's preformance as The Grinch is over-the-top & very cartoony even though his makeup is pretty cool. Some of the jokes are atrocious like the jokes on South Park. The story drugs on & on with pointless subplots. The Whos in this film are even worse then The Grinch himself. While it does follow the book at the 3rd act,its still a bad film. I give this film a 2 out of 10."
5,It's Jim Carrey... need I say more.,It's Jim Carrey... need I say more. This movie is hilarious and since it's Bluray it looks awesome. Buy it now.
2,Great Scenery Bad Story,"I've been a fan of Dr. Seuss's book and the original TV version of this story for as long as I can remember. When I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical yet hopeful. As I saw pictures, I became encouraged. But when I actually got to see the movie, I was highly disappointed.First, the good. Everything from the costumes and people to the sets looks exactly like a Dr. Seuss story brought to life. The cast does a wonderful job, even Jim Carrey, who I'm a marginal fan of at best.However, the best part of this movie is the 30 minutes that tell the original story. The back story, while needed to make this a full length movie, does nothing for the plot and lessons the impact of the themes regarding Christmas. Frankly, I was bored waiting for The Grinch to start stealing Christmas.My recommendation? Skip this movie and get the Boris Karloff cartoon. Or better yet, read the original book. Either would be a better holiday tradition then this disappointing movie."
3,"It's not BAD, just not good","I was really looking forward to this movie and saw it as soon as it came out. I was disappointed. It wasn't so much that the movie was bad, but I think one of Dr. Seuss' most cherished stories deserved better than average. The Grinch has always been a story about the simple meaning of Christmas - this just turned it into a giant marketing tool.On the good side, Jim Carrey does amazing things under all that fur, and the DVD has some nifty extras. Go ahead and buy this for your kids if they loved it in theaters, but make sure to get them the original, too. And throw in the book for good measure."
2,Seems to Be a Copy,"This is a great movie...one of my Christmas favorites. I would not recommending buying from this seller. The video quality is poor, grainy, and it has black spots as it plays. It looks like someone took a video camera to the movie theatre and then burned their own copy. Not sure what the problem is, but I have not seen such poor video quality since VHS."
2,The Cartoon is Better....,"This movie had potential; but leave it to Ron Howard to totally ruin a classic. Jim Carey could have been great, but the tasteless scenes of him eating glass and closeups of the termites in his teeth totally ruin this movie. I know the grinch is ugly, but they went overboard. The silly makeup takes away from the story. I was so busy looking at the noses and hair that I couldn't get into the story. The only word I can think of is ""tasteless."" I rented this for my family and only the 7-year-old liked it; however, we all enjoyed the cartoon version."
3,Good acting by Carrey,A good version of the classic tale updated with suberb special and visual effects and wardoble and also the excelent makeup made by the genious Rick Carter.A good choice.Pick up now.
1,Leave the classics alone,it was the worst movie i had seen in a long time. it had no soul and no feeling. and i was about to pull my hair out having to sit thru it. and then i breathed a sigh of relief when it was over. and i was so down from watching it that i had to see somthing good so i . poped in saving private ryan and my hair pulling was over.then i was happy.
1,Painfully Bad,"This movie would be bad enough on its own, but the way it disrespects the classic children's book it's based on is just awful. Jim C is at his most strenuously unfunny in this travesty. I highly recommend the Chuck Jones animated adaptation (Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas [Blu-ray]) instead."
2,Too scary for my 6 yr old,"Yes the story ends on a good note, but i found the grinch figure to be too scary erratic and psycho for my 6.5 year old. It wasnt fun... i kept watching with her waiting for the story to turn, but it came very late.Besides the scary grinch figure, the story is boring - the plot is thin. Nothing really happens there. Just another Christmas movie."
5,Have to love it!,Have to love Jim Carrey. The kids love it. You never get tired of this movie. Have to have this movie going all christmas long.
2,If you are a fan of Jim Carey. ..,"I ordered this movie for the kids but they didn't finish it. At 4 and 8, they just stopped watching it. I thought it was too loud, too rude and too far from the feel of the original tale. It was visually interesting although the story lacked charm."
2,THE BORING CARREY,"Carrey overacts like always here. Director Ron Howard missed the mark, as he did before in HOWARD THE DUCK. HE started with a good concept on hands, but execution flawed.The movie lacks some kind of ""rhythm"". I almost slept."
5,Movie for all ages,My two year old daughter loved this movie. I had her sit down and watch it one time with me and from then on that is all she wanted to watch. We are still watching it at least 3 times a week!! I recommend this to all families with young children it helps them understand a movie that you'll lovbe to sit and watch too! My daughter loves it so much she can even sing along with them! It's a great stress reliever in our house from the terrible twos!
3,Not quite what we hoped,"The deleted scenes are not included in the movie itself. That was disappointing. We had seen a version of The Grinch at Christmas time with a bunch of new scenes, and we were hoping that this edition would include that version of the movie. Not so. There were two disks, for some reason I cannot fathom. One disk had the theater-version of the movie plus some extras. The second disk had the exact same movie (as far as I could tell) and some commentary.That said, we LOVE this movie and are pleased to have it on DVD>"
5,Jim Carrey is ALWAYS good,Extremely entertaining movie - facsinating sets and filming. The dialog will stick with you as it has with my grandchildren!
5,A season Favorite!!!,"didnt like it the first time i saw it, a bit overwhelming, but it grows on you. it's in the line up from now on!"
4,greatmovie,"great quallity my kids loved watching this movie, jim carrey did a great job but i still think the original is better"
5,well done,my kids and I love to watch this even out of the holiday season. Funny with moral story great family movie.
3,Great Movie! Poor Blu-ray Quality!,"5 Stars for the movie, but the blu-ray release comes across more like subpar DVD quality. Not sure why, but it's Universal's usual absence of quality control with their releases. I sure hope someone remasters this gem and re-releases it. It deserves it! Jim Carrey as the Grinch has to be one of the best performances ever, and the film is top-notched whether your a fan of the animated version or not. Happy Holidays!"
4,Love having dig copy,I only wish i'd paid the couple extra bucks for the High Definition version. Great movie for the whole family.
1,Quality was poor,The movie continued to freeze up throughout the showing. I was unable to complete the entire movie in one sitting due to the defective quality.
2,Downloaded Video,I bought this online and downloaded it and the quality of the video just was horrible! Not sure why?? So live and learn I guess....
1,TERRIBLE!,"Dr. Seuss NEVER would've allowed this movie to be made if he were alive! It was his money grubbing ninny of a wife who gave the nod on this disaster. I'm sure he is turning over in his grave. It was really awful! Not to mention dissapointing considering some of the talent that was involved (Ron Howard directing, Rick Baker providing the makeup, and Sir Anthony Hopkins providing narration)They took FAR to many liberties with the original story simply to drag it out enough to make it movie length. No real Suess fan could possibly enjoy this movie. The only good thing I can say is that the computer animation was done quite well. It was used judiciously and is virtually imperceptible. PASS THIS UP AND GET THE ANIMATED ORIGINAL. It is far, far superior!"
3,A big disappointment!,"This movie, which was painful to view especially with my 7 year old present, totally destroyed the spirit of Dr. Seuss. In his book the Grinch was a Grumpy old person who just wanted in the end that the people like him. In this dark comedy we get a vicious beast that tries to kill a little girl without a thought. The same beast is sought after by a sex craved woman.The director tried to rip off the Munchkin Land (a la Wizard of Oz) look of the town and does a real poor job of it. There is a lot of camp in this movie which is really poor quality (maybe the director should have watched some old Batman on TV to find out how to get it right).If you are taking the kids I suggest Rugrats in Paris which is a thoroughly entertaining film for both children and adults. It is also one that you can feel safe taking the smaller kids to unlike this muddled affair."
1,Poor quality,The movie was open when it came in the mail. When we played it the quality was VERY poor! Color was bad
1,Watch Jim Carrey Ruin A Classic,"This is in the running for one of the worst movies ever made. The original Grinch has a poignant message of the true meaning of Christmas - coming without packages, parcels or bags. This one has Jim Carrey celebrating excess. Somewhere Dr. S. is rolling in his grave."
1,complete waste of time,"This movie was...HORRIBLE!!!!! If I had to pick one good thing about it, I would choose the makeup job on Jim Carrey (you can't even tell it's him). But everything else was horrible. This hardly followed the book at all, and hardly used any dialogue from it. If you want excellent Dr. Seuss movies, go see ""In Search of Dr. Seuss"" and ""The Cat in the Hat"" with Mike Myers."
1,why,I'm supposed to write a review on this and I don't know why. I do not know what this is or what it is about and I don't recall ever purchasing it.
4,Suprised.,I can't believe I liked this movie. I hate Jim Carrey. He was nothing like he is in his other movies. This movie is great. I love how they added more to the story than the original cartoon version. A must own.
2,Carey disappoints,My husband and I were both disappointed with this. We like Jim Carey and did not think he was very funny in this one. Trying to stretch a 30 minute cartoon that was perfect the way it was does not make an entertaining feature.
2,mediocre new film about the legendary Grinch,"OK, I admit Carrey gave a lot of good, witty lines to his character in this film. Watching scenes with him alone in his cavern is simply a pleasure, but everything surrounding those scenes is dull, dreary, and damn near unbearable. The sets are colourful but the hazy photography doesn't let them shine through. This film was more depressing than uplifting: at a certain point I just couldn't wait until it finished. Especially from director Ron Howard this is an appalling mess of a film. Let's hope his upcoming A BEAUTIFUL MIND is better."
5,5 stars all the way!,"I have loved this classic story ever since I can remember! And now, they made a bigger better version! I saw The Grinch (Jim Carrey) 8 times in the theater! Being only 11, I can't wait until I can buy this DVD! I can't wait to see deleted sences and see funny outtakes with Jim Carrey! I ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO BUY THIS MOVIE!!"
1,Absolute WORST movie I have ever seen!!!,"All I can remember about this awful movie is being disapointed at every turn. The constant bending and revision of the original story-line, the unlikable poorly done charecters, the terrible acting, etc. Really not a movie that I would recommend. The book is much better, best to stick to that and forget this sorry excuse.If I could give it zero stars instead of one I would, but apparantly amazon will allow one as the lowest possible rating."
4,How the Grinch Stole Xmas,"Christmas classic; Share with everyone the true meaning of Holiday spirit with the fun creatures of Who-Ville. This is a holiday must-watch! Jim Carey plays The Grinch hilariously and determined. Remember that it only takes one good heart to keep the spirit alive! Disc arrived in original packaging, great film!"
1,Kids liked it....,"I thought it was terrible. I love the older animated version. I thought a lot of the humor was inappropriate. I'm not a prude, but thought this movie could have been much better. I expected more from Ron Howard."
2,Missing scenes,"First I should mention that I love the movie. The problems that I have are with this disc not the movie. First off it says on the cover that Blu-Ray + DVD Combo Pack but there was no DVD. Second off the HD quality is quite low (you can barely tell the difference between this and DVD quality). Lastly and most importantly, this version has a lot of scenes missing. Overall very disappointing."
3,"Good rendition, but new DVS and talking setup fails","I purchased this particular DVD for my blind brother. The decision to purchase it was based on the indication that it not only included a Descriptive Video Track (DVS), but it also had a talking menu setup so a blind individual would not need a sighted person to set it up to play in DVS. The talking setup worked once and we were unable to make it work again after multiple tries on different TV and DVD players. This was disappointing.Aside from that, the visual rendition, sound and widescreen format are perfect and for a sighted person the DVD is fine."
2,special grinch,snow globe broke in mail. had to send it all back and the whole reason we bought this dvd was that it had spanish subtitles when others did not
1,Brutal.....absolutely brutal!,"To begin, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's slow, it's shabby, it's shotty and it (...). Too much garbage was added into this movie. The Grinch going to Whoville to accept his award made me fall asleep. The Grinch ""casing"" Whoville in a disguise was another disaster. The ending above all should have been left alone. It should have ended just like the original. Ron Howard in his infinite wisdom couldn't even do that. All around this movie should have never been made. The extras on the DVD were boring as well. Keep away from this movie."
5,Classic Christmas Movie,My family decided to have Christmas at my house this year. Of course we had to watch a Christmas Classic. The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is amazing! & it always gives me a good laugh. Every kid and adult should get to watch this at least once in their lifetime.
2,Cinematic turd,Does anyone recall when Robin Williams made Popeye? This is Jim Carreys Popeye. Clunky and more than a little annoying.
3,Poor adaptation of the original story,This is a very flat and boring adaptation of the original story. Jim Carey tries his very best to make this Grinch interesting but the lack of inspiration of the adaptation is limiting his impact on the overall movie.Must watch only if you have nothing else to do
5,Good Christmas movie...,"This version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is really good. Carrey does a great job of playing the Grinch. It's one of our family's favorites during the holidays..."
4,Wild ride in Who-ville,This movie is a weird holiday romp. Jim Carrey lays it on thick but we enjoyed watching the live action version of the animated holiday classic. Happy Holidays!
5,Family Holiday Must See Movie!,We laugh and laugh every year as a family as we watch it with popcorn and soda. You should add it to your list too.
5,Love this,This is such a good movie. Ron Howard did a top notch job on this movie. They could not have been easy shoes to fill. We all grew up with the grinch and the orignal Dr. Suess book. Talk about preconceived notions. But this movie tells the basic story with a few side turns along the way which is good in this case to change up the story and give it a bit of depth.
5,LOVE THIS VERSION OF THE GRINCH....,JIM CARREY IS HYSTERICAL IN THIS FILM. EVERY TIME YOU WATCH IT YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. GREAT MOVIE.
1,Hangs in middle,It is a brand new DVD but it skips an hangs in middle. That not right. I have to forward certain scenes
4,Good,I love this. And so does my 6 month old daughter now. She has been watching this from the time she was 1 month old. :D
5,grinch,great movie! Always fun to watch the classics around this time of year and this just adds to the excitement!
3,Nice Show,"Nice family show. The kids loved it. We watch it every Christmas time, and the kids never get tired of it."
5,Great Movie for all ages!,"Though I was surprised it wasn't identical to the original, I enjoyed this movie tremendously! No one but Jim Carrey could have pulled off this part, his delivery of humor mixed in with the Dr. Suess dialog was priceless. Great for all ages, especially some humor only adults could appreciate. Precious story of the ""Real Meaning"" of Christmas. This movie is a blessing of laughter."
4,Universal Upgrades to Grinch 2.0 (and no adult language!),"Advantages: An expensive remake to the original, pretty props, learning more about the fairy-tale WhovilleDisadvantages: Goes astray from the book, Cindy Lou Who is considered as an older, only child in this rehashUniversal did a fairly nice job at re-making this high-budget classic: expensive props, visuals, and sound effects. Unfortunately, ortions of the acting and storyline seem mediocre, and this film isn't nearly as close to the original. But hey, how can the originals be outshined anyway?This film is far better than most other PG-rated films, and it wouldn't hurt to add this to your Christmas collection. It's supposed to be funnier than the cartoon, with the aid of Jim Carrey. It makes a true classic, and is very heart-warming, especially at the end.Great, but could've been a lot better for a 100-minute film."
1,The Grinch,"I do not like this because I purchased it thinking it was a DVD and it would not let me return it. So, I have this movie that I am not even able to watch."
3,Disappointing for Ron Howard,Ron Howard producing a movie generally marks a movie I and the family would enjoy. We are rarely disappointed.This version of the Grinch was borderline unacceptable for my 2 year old granddaughter and pretty boring for the adults. Spent most of the movie guessing where we had seen the actors before.
4,How The Grinch Stole Christmas... And Our Hearts,"I'm not going to rate this movie on anything other than the actual content in the movies. This review is NOT for VHS/DVD/Blu Ray bonus content, video quality, make-up, music (although if you're interested in the music, I have a review for the soundtrack as well!), or the chosen actors. If you're here for that, go elsewhere, because I'm not offering it!This movie tells the story of a poor soul that everybody is scared of and that nobody really ""likes."" The character is portrayed as a moderately evil (Dr. Seuss style) character that is misunderstood and has a dark past, which is why he hates Christmas.Having said that, this movie is basically saying that anybody can be a dark and misunderstood person that nobody ""likes,"" but it's the inside that counts. This sort of thing is told over the course of the film, in a rather drug-out way. However, the film is touching and a wonderful Christmas movie!I will watch this every year with my family!"
1,Yellow Snow,"...Folks, I wish I were a better scribe so that I could just tell you how [bad]this movie is. I'll just sum up the plot a bit: the Grinch is the good guy and the Whos down in Whoville are the bad guys who love the commercialization of Christmas. Oh, and isn't that Who wife-swapping party a nice touch in a family picture?That sound you hear is Dr. Seuss spinning in his grave..."
1,Dissapointed,"Clicked on HD. Page refreshed, but upon order and play realized I was still watching the standard definition. Totally not worth 3 dollars."
3,"daughter loved it, I could leave it","Jim Carrey is not my favorite actor but my daughter and husband really enjoyed this movie. My daughter was riveted to the screen b/c she knows the storyline from the book.There are a ton of changes but it is essentially the same. The Grinch is mean, gross, and overacts. Sigh. But the secondary characters are great and the costumes and settings are just magical."
4,New Christmas Classic,"Good family Christmas movie. THe kids thoroughly enjoyed it. They watched it multipe times. Download worked very smoothly on my Roku XS, love Amazon Prime!!!"
1,"I do not give one or five stars lightly, but…","If I could give it a star-and-a-half, I would, because I did chuckle once or twice, but I can't, and this movie does NOT deserve two stars!⊕ Umm… when it DOES follow the book, it's mostly faithful; Jim Carrey made me laugh a few times; most of the actors wear so much prosthetic makeup they could potentially deny ever being in this film&#8854; Padded with senseless and unnecessary subplots and back-story; nauseating cinematography; uses only two of the original's memorable songs, and this rendition of the title song is just plain awful; ""Where Are You, Christmas"" is one of the top 5 worst Christmas songs ever; much of the humor is inappropriate for its target audience; ironically criticizes the commercialization of Christmas, while itself being a shameless cash-in of a classic; the Whos' makeup is borderline horrifying"
4,For my Christmas DVD collection,"I saw this in the theatre when it was first released about a decade ago and liked it then, I also like the original cartoon classic with Boris Karloff narrating. This is a well done screen adaptation of the Christmas classic. Jim Carrey is wonderful as he captures the essence of The Grinch character. Very enjoyable and fun to watch especially each Christmas season."
4,The Grinch,Great Movie. I watched it with my 5 year old grandson and we both enjoyed it. Jim Carey was superb as usual.
3,{Nothing} good or bad about it.,"I'h liked the grinch, but not The cat in the hat whcich was2/5 for me. How can I buy this if its only on AMAZON.I liked Mike myers in The cat in the hat, but everything else is like Charlie brown- is kissing the little red haired girl. {Charlie brown- funny, dork, baseball couch, in comic strip Peanuts.}I guess Jim is not in OVER THE HEDGE. Whats this world coming to??! Anyway, they are both nice movies and the set is a 3.66*'sfrom me. P.S. The cat in the hat is dead, isn't it?"
1,Bought the Grinch last year.........,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't comment on this edition, since it was last years edition, that I bought and was pleased with. What I am displeased with is that one year later, we have another Deluxe edition, which is getting to be more than a little bit of overkill. How many editions of a movie does Hollywood think we need to own? (Unless you're a collector of such things). The same goes for all the third and fourth editions of movies that the Studios want to pick our pockets with.....365 days a year!"
2,BIG Dr. Suess & Jim Carrey Fan,"I LOVED the original Suess cartoon The Grinch. I have watched it every Christmas Eve for as long as I can remember. The music, the animation, the voices, the story... EVERYTHING was great!I am also a big fan of Jim Carrey since he was In Living Color. I own most of his movies and love him as an actor/comedian.This combination was supposed to WORK!!! It had the production money, the right costumes, the right actors, and the right direction, but there was something missing. Carrey's voice was nowhere near as good as he is capable of. The story was changed around quite a bit. The narrator's voice was off. The whole thing just reeked of ""Not Dr. Suess"". If you want a good movie, get the original cartoon, and Carrey's Truman Show or Me, Myself, & Irene. Sometimes you can't combine two great things successfully..."
3,The Grinch,"Compared to other family and/or children's movies this one was a disappointment. I think Jim Carey could have added a bit more of his personality to the performance. In fact, I hoped the Grinch would have been more funny. It must have been hard to create a movie out of a 30 minute cartoon."
4,Classic Christmas Movie,"I saw this when it came out, and it was more than what i had expected of it. It was great to see the book come to life, in all the colours of christmas"
3,"Good movie, But, Not The Original.","This edition of the Grinch is good. Nicely done by Jim Carey. Though, understanding him is not the easiest. You may need to turn on the subtitles the first time you watch it. In my opinion, stick with the original cartoon."
2,Ugh!,"""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a classic story by the master storyteller Dr. Seuss. It has an anti-commercialist message, but isn't overly preachy. This, however, is disgusting. It's hypocritical in the way that it was over-commercialized, and the plot totally strays from the book. In an attempt to lengthen the book's plot into a two-hour movie, it was mutilated and convoluted. Not only did the costume manager manage to make Jim Carrey thouroughly disgusting, she or he did so with the Whos too. The only good part was the sets, which were pure eye candy, from the bright colors of Whoville to the dank musty caves of the Grinch.All in all, get the original animated version. Don't waste your precious cash on this travesty."
1,Lacks wit. For die-hard Carrey fans and the very young.,"This is a mishmash of a movie, full of Jim Carrey making his usual faces, but with an implausible addition to the classical Grinch plotline, in order to make it ""interesting"" to adults.Save your money for the classic Grinch. This one just doesn't work. Bah, humbug!"
2,Not quite sure about this one,"Ok, basically, I must admit that I did enjoy this movie. I saw it with my sister and I liked it very much. It was a fairly satisfying movie. My favorite parts included Cindy Lou's (Taylor Momsen) version of ""Where are You, Christmas?"" and the ending part where the Grinch's heart ""grew three sizes."" It's a classic story that has won the hearts of people worldwide. I'm pretty sure I'd recommend this movie to older audiences, but certainly not young children. While Jim Carrey is a good actor, his version of the Grinch was, in my opinion, way too intense for little kids. He speaks language that I personally wouldn't want my own kids to witness (if, of course, I had kids, which I don't). Too violent and inappropriate for young ones--give them a different Christmas movie to watch or show them the cartoon version of ""The Grinch,"" but don't break out this one. The kids can definitely stand to take a pass on the crude humor and sick jokes presented here."
2,A spirtless film,The visuals were wonderful but the whole film lacked any spirit. It was a very paint by numbers movie. Lacks any joy or heart.
1,"Unacceptable, worthless adaptation","There are no redeeming qualities to this version. The original is perfect, and this adaptation is a complete bastardization. Horrid. No good moments at all."
1,bad,the movie is so long and annoying. two many seens of the grinch alone in his cave. talyor momsen is good though. i also like the max playhouse feature on the dvd.other tahan taht the movie was the pitts.
3,not the best I've seen but good.,"I think the movie was pretty good. There were times when Jim Carrey got a little crude but that doesn't suprise me. This movie was definatly targeted to adults more than kids. People that had grown up with the movie. I don't think that they needed to have that whole love thing going on between the grinch and the girl but all in all I think it was a good movie. They were very accurate to the book. I was very impressed that they used all the same lines from the original one. I loved all the sets I think that if ""whoville"" was real that is what it would look like. I think its a good movie and I'll definatly add it to my collection."
2,Could've been a lot better........,"Before I went to the theater to see this movie I heard on the radio that this movie was going to be ""the next Wizard of Oz"", but it wasn't! I enjoyed it a little bit, but haven't cared to see it again. Co-star Taylor Momsen makes a very unconvincing Cindy Lou Who. She should've won a Golden Raseberry Award for 'worst supporting actress' or something. Jim Carry is kind of funny but not as cruel and bitter as the Grinch in the cartoon. I'd rather stick with the Wizard of Oz than this. But everyone has a right to their own opinion. Rent it first. Then decide on whether or not you wish to by this."
1,TERRIBLE!,"Ok, here is the deal. I watched this movie in class today and I have to say that I HATED it!But, it does have it's moments. Here is a list of the Pros and ConsPROS:1. Jim Carrey once again does a great job acting2. Some funny jokes and comedy bits3. Most of the scenes on Whooville lived up to the original (The toys and the look of the people were great.)4. Good randitions of the original songsCONS:1. I find that the movie is way too long. Especially around the end. This one scene goes on, and on to the point where I was bored with it2. They changed the story a bit. They showed a bit of the Grinches childhood saying why he gates Christmas. Personally I hated it.3. Althought Jim does a good acting job he overdoes it sometimesSo overall this movie is... Ok. It's worth a watch if you must, but I would never buy it. If you are buying the grinch you should buy the cartoon version. That's a five star movie :D"
2,Disappointing,"I can't put my finger on just what it is about this movie that turns me off. It can't just be the absence of the magnificent Boris Karloff. Somehow, this movie feels loveless. It has a cold, cynical feeling to it to me. I simply do not get the feeling that this was done out of a love of Christmas or Dr. Suess or anything other than Mammon, the Holy Dollar. It isn't ""nasty"" or anything. IT will certainly entertain small children. The ""backstory"" of how the Grinch became ""grinchy"" feels forced and shallow. I just think it was ill-advised to stretch this simple, beautiful original story into this long, empty movie. To me, it's as if I decided to ""improve"" the Mona Lisa, because, for example, I think I can ""show people what she is smiling at."""
3,"Anthony Michaels review of ""How the Grinch stole Christmas""","This was a perfect example of a movie that is trying to hard to be funny, and is using violence to get the movie into the theader. I honestly wish I could say that I liked the movie, because it was very creative, the acting was great, the makeup and sets were fantastic... but I can't say that I liked this movie. The old Grinch movie was a classic, along with Dr. Suess' masterpiece. But, this movie just wasn't much of a classic. Unfortunatly, I know that review will most likely make people mad. I can't help that. I've got to say what I think. Jim Carrey, however, did a great job protraying the Grinch...."
1,Terrible,"This made me want to gouge my eyes out and my ears off. Even if the fx weren't awful the movie may have ended up being charming somehow, but Jim Carey's acting and voice officially ruined whatever hope it had. The only redeeming quality in this movie is the dog.Don't waste your time or money on this movie, unless you hate yourself and/or your children."
3,the grinch,all the good parts were taken out of the video.other than that the movie is great my husband loves this movie.
3,"Worth renting, but original cartoon is better overall.","Well, I never saw it at the theater, the preview certainly didn't inspire me. My wife came back from Blockbuster with it this past weekend and the whole family watched it (DVD). My two kids (6 & 8) enjoyed it and I guess we all enjoyed it overall. I would just say that the gross humor was not needed as usual and the story was dragged out too much. I didn't like the parts where the Grinch came in disguise and wrecked stuff and I didn't like it very much either with his visit for the special celebration. I dunno, they just changed too much and the movie wasn't heppy feeling, it was kinda dark and I actually felt a little depressed afterward, even though the ending seemed happy at the end. The DVD extras are OK, but nothing great, especially the deleted scenes, a waste. So, as my review title states, it's worth renting, but I don't think I'd buy it or watch it again. I do however, own the cartoon and we watch that a number of times each year!"
4,Christmas in Whooville,"The Grinch is intended to be entertaining and not entirely thought provoking! Dr. Seuss' original it is not, but few movies ever capture the essence of the original. Enjoy the movie for its intended purpose and don't be a GRINCH. ""Christmas doesn't come from a store.....Perhaps Christmas means a little bit more............"" Tis the season to be jolly.........Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night..."
2,Not even Jim Carrey can save this clunker!!,"The problem with this movie is that it's one hour too long. This movie could have worked if they would have just stuck to the original premise of the story and done away with the other characters. I didn't care about any of the supporting characters except for the originals that were in the book. Jim Carrey does a wonderful acting job as the hated Grinch. But not even he can save this movie. Kids may love it, but I didn't care for it. Stick with the book!!"
1,Brutal.....absolutely brutal!,"To begin, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's slow, it's shabby, it's shotty (...). Too much garbage was added into this movie. The Grinch going to Whoville to accept his award made me fall asleep. The Grinch ""casing"" Whoville in a disguise was another disaster. The ending above all should have been left alone. It should have ended just like the original. Ron Howard in his infinite wisdom couldn't even do that. All around this movie should have never been made. The extras on the DVD were boring as well. Keep away from this movie."
1,Movie,Tried to watch movie with granddaughter but could not. Picture was very blurry and I tried various settings on TV to no avail. we ended up getting movie from cable company which cost a little more but picture was perfect.
5,Classic!,"It's a great remake of the classic ""Grinch""...great for all ages! My whole family loves it & we watch both every year!"
5,How the grinch stole christmas,"Awesome show, It's better then the cartoon. It's a show you could watch over and over again! Trust me I have, my kids love it!!!!"
5,BDP in full effect,"If you consider yourself a rap fan and do not own this andevery other BDP album then you are what one might call frontin'. Itmay sound a bit dated now with the predominance of drum tracks in poptoday, but nothing beats Material Love, or 100 Guns, or even theExhibits. This was rap in its purest form with KRS ..., et. alschooling current rap and rap generations to come.There are tworap groups that set the standard which all other rap groups eitheraspire to or come close. BDP and .... And imagine this - anentire rap album without the word blunt on it. God bless BDP cuz theyfunky."
5,Great album!,"This album is great but totally different.This and Blueprint of Hiphop are so unique from BDP's other albums.While I like the old albums better, this new style still earns 5 stars.Too bad they're in the past.I can't believe it's been almost 20 years since this one came out, seems like yesterday."
2,Disapointing,"Should have been called disappointment, BDP is no PE. KRS1's `knowledge' is really no more than Nation Of Islam rhetoric, not so cleverly put to music. KRS1 was always more `preacher' than `teacher', inviting obedience rather than introspection. Here, in `Ya Strugglin' he adds homophobia to his cannon of hates."
3,OK for a minute...,"I recieved this bible as a graduation gift back in 2004. I think its great for the new believer. I used it up until recently when I began doing bible studies with a friend who uses a NKJV. I began noticing pretty large differences in the wording which changed the meaning of the text. Like I said, its great for the new believer, its very easy to understand, but I wouldn't suggest using it for an extended period of time as there are versions out there that are more edifying."
4,Good,These are great - however I did find them cheaper at Best Buy and for that I was disappointed especially when you pay $49.00 and I could have got them for about $20.00
5,Bond Collection,It was good to get most of the Connery Bonds in the two volumes. It helped make the total collection a few less DVDs on the shelf.
4,Awesome,"Sean Connery, the first, the coolest, the baddest Bond of all time. Retro cool, before there was such a thing!"
5,First Class - Great Restoration,My collelction of James Bond movies are with Sean Connery only. Why? Because I have read all the Ian Flemming books and the early movies come closer to what was written and what likely a Double 007 would be capable of doing. The later versions are move like Hollywood demonstrating their stunt skills with less plot. I also think that Connery was the closest to the character described by Fleming in his books.The restoration was excellent and the color superb. I will enjoy seeing these movies for years to come.
3,Shop Around,"This is an excellent product, however I advise everyone to shop around. I picked up the 6 disk versions of volume 1 and 2 at Wal-mart today for $9.99 each."
5,Sean Connery 007 volume 2,I purchased this product from Amazon and am quite pleased with it. It replaces three VHS tapes that were lost in transit when we moved. I am very happy with the DVD.
4,bond,I am a big fan of the franchise and this movie collection is a great piece to my overall goal of owning every Bond.
5,You have older versions? Give them away and Treat Yourself!,"In the 1960s, as a college student, I saw the original movies. What a DELIGHT to see the astounding restorations done, from the original negatives, by Lowery Digital!!! The true colors, the lack of visible scratches and 'noise'... amazing. The VHS and earlier-DVD renditions I have in my possession are absolutely relegated to the trash-heap (well, to giveaway freebies). And that's not the whole of the story --- each film comes with a 'companion' DVD of extra features and behind-the-scenes information and interviews that bring many extra dimensions of appreciation for the astounding collaboration (and serendipity) behind great films."
2,Not very happy,"Two corner pieces failed during assambly. Had to spend over $50.00 for replacements and 2-day shipping. The day after it was up, I had a fair rain which is not uncommon this time of the year in the Houston area. Water collected in the ""middle edge"" on all 4 sides destroying the stays in the cover. I do not expect this item to last."
4,Overall pleased but for one aspect,"This is a very sturdy canopy with 2"" tubular frame pieces, the largest I have found for this size canopy. Once assembled this canopy is not flimsy, and I have seen it handle 40+ mph winds easily because it has vents at the top and the strong frame. This is not a flimsy pop-up canopy. Only one flaw, with the frame left assembled and in the weather all year, rust forms on the inside of the framing and starts to discolor the power coat. Suggestion, build and then use with legs mounted in 75lbs or more of quikrete in 4 plastic planters from Lowes. I have it this way on my concrete patio. It will not move/fly away and it can be easily dissasembled. Since the canopy is tall, you have to stand on your table under the frame to put up the canopy, or have a ladder. If left in a storm, a large amount of rain will collect on the cover and have to be dumped. Cover should be removed for storms."
1,JVC XVN322,"I bought this dvd player 2 years ago to replace a cheaper model. This dvd player will play most anything on a disc. Now after 2 years of normal use it started to act extremely tempermental. Frequently it will say reading when a disc is loaded,and wont play without the disc being reloaded several times. Disc have gotten stuck inside this machine several times and it has scratched the discs. I would not recomend this player unless you only plan to use it for about a year."
4,Interesting robotics book,"I was taken back when I first got the book as all the sample code seemed to be in Parallax's PBASIC. I thought this was a Java robotics book! But as I got into it, the robot is programmed in Java and talks to BASIC Stamp microcontrollers via serial interface. The microcontrollers handle critical peripherals. He does say that you could use another microcontroller instead of the BASIC Stamp, and suggests the Parallax Javelin Stamp which is programmed in Java as well. In fact, on his web site, he has the Javelin code to replace the PBASIC code in the book if you should decide to go that route and keep everything pure Java (which I recommend as I really like the Javelin Stamp). The book does go into a number of topics such as vision, speech, etc. and does a good job of covering each subject. To me, this is a keeper. It is a good reference."
5,The definitive guide to starting with Java and Micro,"The book is written in a very understandable way to the layman. It comes with several sample code from his site and you can directly download the project folder with which to test the codes.The author, Scott Preston, he is very willing to come in against in case of problems whose solution is not to be found among the pages of the book.Absolutely recommended all those who want to learn how to use Java with microcontrollers."
5,Good book,"Good book, helped clarify my understanding and the differences between SANs & NAS. Really helpful for those who know nothing and those who already have a background in it."
3,This is a entry-level book. Too general for serious work,This book focuses on general concept and structure. No vendor specified information is included. It is a good entry-level book. But serious SAN/NAS users will need more detailed information.
3,Good Overview,"This book has a good 10K foot overview and basic groundings for beginners. Also is good at comparing and contrasting SAN vs NAS. But, very light on detail especially in the area of NAS. If you don't know anything about SAN/NAS give it a read. If you've much experience it'll be mostly review."
3,"Good overview, but Kindle edition has some issues","This book provides a good overview of the differences between NAS and SAN devices, but I bought this book to read on my Kindle and some of the diagrams and pictures were a little too hard to see and that can make understanding parts of this book a little difficult."
3,Good terminology book,"This book very well covers its objective of orienting one with SAN and NAS market and its major differences. It's incorporating most key terminology in Storage network and related issues in concise manner. Though more detail is not expected from this small size book, it would be good to have more technical information then abstract one.This book is good for quick introduction to NAS and SAN market but can't be used as bible of either field."
5,Compelling and very disturbing,"I was stunned by this movie. The clarity with which Loach shows Janice's plight is heroic. I felt myself hating and wanting to hurt her parents for doggedly draining any spark of life out of their daughter and then wondering if her parents really were to blame. And if they're not, then who is? The documentary style of the film was very compelling and I later looked up the actors' names on the Internet to verify that they really were actors. I'm not an expert but I certainly hope that people who are diagnosed as ""mentally ill"" today are treated with more intelligence and respect."
1,Frustrating,"I had to watch this video and do a review on it by the end of September to complete my Bachelor's degree. Four weeks went by and I had received nothing. I had to email my professor that the assignment woulld not be completed in the allotted time due to the fact that I had not received this video. I was not happy, and I was embarrassed. The only bright side to this story was that I got my full refund back; no questions asked."
4,:),"I love it! I was just a little disappointed because I expected a little more skit material, but the songs are funny which make up for most of that. Overall it's great!"
5,Italian Baseball?,"For anyone who loves baseball, food, wine, Italy, and music (not necessarily in that order), this is the book for you. Dave Bidini's experiences with the Peones are hilarious. Imagine the passion that Italians have about everything in life. Now imagine that passion when arguing with an umpire. Hot dogs in the dugout? Not in Italy. Italians know how to eat! Read this book...you won't be disappointed."
4,Great book!,"A wonderful book, providing both Spanish and English versions of the poems side-by-side, which is excellent for my Spanish studies. It arrived with a sticker on the spine that is the type to leave white residue, however the rest of the book is in perfect condition."
5,Lovely Collection of Poetry,"This beautiful collection of poetry contains both English & Spanish versions of Neruda's poetry. It contains great breadth & depth at the core and encompasses the vastness of Neruda's work - love, politics, everyday life, landscape. This is a GREAT gift book!"
5,Essential!,"Yes, this is the Essential Neruda. It's not complete, but it covers all of his topics and contains some wonderful gems and insight. If you only buy one Neruda volume, make it this one."
5,"Excellent Translations, Great Aid For Learning A Different Side Of Spanish Outside The Confines Of A Boring Textbook","I highly recommend this edition! It's wonderful to go back and forth, line to line, reading the English translations first, then the original Spanish. Translations are fluid! A fantastic way to introduce yourself to one of the greatest poets of all time!"
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!,"This book was boring, filled with too much English 101 inside this book instead of how to break it into the technical writing fields. I could have used a old college English instead"
2,Had to Purchase for Class,I had to purchase this book for class. I only used it once and it wasn't really worth the money.
3,Practical not Pretty,"While this book is a practical guide for professional writers, it isn't enough on its own.I haven't used the book enough to make it worth the price I paid but it's a nice refresher for things I should know but don't remember."
1,Nice general guide but little else,"I purchased this book online while doing a massive repair job on a series of Engineering Manuals that were filled with writing errors and confusing information. This book is more like a handy dandy thesaurus but for real technical writing, it is virtually uselesss. The Microsoft Word Help Index has better examples. I found it to be confusing and actually a bit disorganized with tons of info that most people past English 101 should know, especially Technical Writers or those who describe themselves as being so. I don't recommend it."
3,Great Book Good Price,I got this book fairly cheap and has pretty much all the same info as the ninth addition. good deal
4,A good reference,Good for referencing if you already know what your doing; not really a cover-to-cover read.
5,Great book,Being I had done Technical Writing for so many years I still know I could learn things and this book had some great info and is a good ref to have around as a writer or as a novice.
4,quite OK,"I'm not a big fan of John Lee Hooker, I go for more melodic styles, but I liked this CD. Sonically, it's not much, but the music is... I don't know, it's deep, pure and it hits you right in your most vulnerable spot. If only the sound were better..."
2,With all due respect to Casper Van Dien....,"OK movie, but for those of us who love (read: dote on) James Dean, this in no way measures up to the other movies and films by and about Dean. If you want a 5-star flick of Dean's life, order ""James Dean"" starring James Franco. Measuring up to the real James Dean (by portraying him) is actually not possible, but Franco does an admirable job and emanates the Dean essence quite good."
1,Worst movie about deans life.,first of all I only bought this movie because it cost a dollar. I'm a dean fan and thought this movie was so badly done. They just threw together alot of famous facts about James dean. They way the filmakers portray Dean an pier's love story is so corny and overdone. If you want to see better versions of a dean movie bio watch the 2001 tv movie with James franco or the1976 version with Stephen McHattie.
2,These chairs were exactly what I was looking for.,I received them in very good condition. I would have paid more for these chairs in the marketplace where I live. These were cheaper and even with including the shipping of them. I'm very pleased.
