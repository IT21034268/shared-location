2,Stop with the two sided discs!,Cmon on Warner Brothers! Paramount and Fox have double feature disc sets that have each on a seperate disc. And for the same MSRP $14.99! Get with the program. Stop putting your movies on double-sided discs!
5,awsome product,fits perfect on my ruger mark 3 scope fit perfect and sighting it in was a breeze. awsome is only thing can say
4,Close to perfect Mark 2 mount!,"This was mounted on a Ruger Mark 2 Target with 6 7/8 barrel. With this see-through mount I can still even see through the iron target sights. Mount was firm and installed without any problems. Very nice finish but a little bulky. My biggest complaint would be that the pistol will not fit the Black Dog holster http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K7ZG0W/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00. Because the mount is thicker than I expected and the screws that clamp the mount to the pistol receiver are in the way, the pistol with this mount will NOT fit the holster that I was hoping for. I'll will be returning the Blackdog Holster and probably go with a scoped over-the-shoulder carry holster."
2,Dividing by zero problems in this deck,"The cards are nice and sturdy, but I noticed that in whatever universe the publisher lives in, it must be possible to divide by zero. It did provide an interesting and humorous teaching moment with my daughter, but mistakes like this are pretty much unacceptable in a teaching aid. (See example from my deck: [...]). If you're looking for division cards that are correct, you may wish to keep looking."
1,Waste of Money,"The puzzles on this game are way too difficult, grapics are bad, and its not in the least bit exciting."
4,master of characterization,"The tradition of strangers meeting on the road is as old as the Canterbury Tales, and this literary genre is given a South of the Border slant as a group of strangers meet at a ferry crossing in Mexico, where the crossing is slowed by a bureaucratic glitch. Steinbeck used the same literary conceit in THE WAYWARD BUS, and MacDonald uses it to showcase his strengths as a writer. In his non-Travis McGee novels, MacDonald was incredibly adept at characterization based conflict, and this novel showcases that particular talent. Each character's back-story baggage is fleshed out in conflict with another character, driving the ebb and flow of plot-lines into a series of personal climaxes. He is such a talented writer that his stories never sink into soap-opera cliches"
3,Script made for a movie,"John D Macdonald wrote many classic novels in his life but this was not one of them. I would rank it as a good quick read (only about 175 pages) and while it is not that memorable, it contains some good insights into the human mind.As a river crossing in Mexico, a string of people are delayed and have to wait for the crossing to be made available to them. The book looks at a number of these people and how they reached this point in their lives. I think Macdonald had a movie in mind when he wrote this book as I think the book (if it hadn't been already) could be a good movie.Not his greatest, but a good time-filler."
3,Damned Indeed,"I'm a long time MacDonald fan, but THE DAMNED is on the heavy side of prose. It may have been ahead of it's time or influenced by movies at the end of the noir period while MacDonald was still polishing his skills as a writer.Dark, haunted characters caught in Mexico, a couple on their honeymoon attract attention by the incessant arguments. A woman of the night who stumbles across the narrator for meaningless contact above the sheets, it's too hot for anything else.MacDonald rescues the participants with finite details that pull you into their lives against your will, fate gives them a second chance.Nash Black, author whose books are also available in Kindle editions."
3,good stuff,"BOLD were in the thick of things, back there in the 80`s.the early stuff by these guys was solid,true hardcore (though never a real favourite of mine)...but they soon hit the slippery slope of selling out"
3,ok but not as good as original.,"harrison ford is awesome, the rest of the cast is silly.Sabrina (1995)the girl acts as she wants to get nasty-i suspect she went to the school of nasty in paris -the city of nasty- - the romance between her and the brothers is flurty fun but not really love. the funniest scean is when her servent father says he's been insider trading all these years and is almost as rich as the larabee's. i'm not an old school geazer i think the humphery bogot versen has room for improvement; but it's still better than this bad remake."
5,A GREAT learning tool!,"Having only a basic knowledge of the Java2 language I was able to read each chapter and easily learn the clear and well presented constructs, principles, and procedures which were presented. I used the skills I obtained from this book to build my first completely Java driven forum. An excellent choice for any level Java Developer"
4,"Very good book, for learning and certification purposes","I gave it 4 starts because:1. Custom Tags, introduced in chapter 3, are based on the old JSP1.1 version , instead of explain it directly based on JSP1.2.2. Chapter 12, ""The JSP Standard Tag Library"", is out of date, so you should better ignore it.3. There is almost not a word about web patterns.4. Didn't find a way to report minor mistakes. Also didn't find any source for errata information."
1,"There is no ""More"" in More Servlet","Happy with the author's Core Servlets book, I bought this book hoping that I could learn more. However, I was disappointed and felt ripped-off. 50% of the content is the same as the first book. To be fair to the author, there is some new material, such as JSTL. However, having 2 books with almost identical content is really a waste. I think the cover should warn potential buyers of the similarity with the Core book. Sorry Marty, last time I gave you five stars, now I think I am generous enough to give you 1 star."
5,I wish I had this book when I started surfing!,"this is an excellent book for surfers of any level, but focuses on beginners. There's a great history of women in surfing and profiles of today's up and comers. The book is well written and well designed, there are great photographs throughout. I wish I would have had this book when I started surfing, I had to learn the hard way! It's great to see the women of surfing getting the attention they deserve."
2,Not for women,"I had high hopes for this book, but it failed to deliver. Part of it is like a Facebook page, part of it like a dictionary, part of it like the Yellow Pages. There wasn't enough focus on actually how to surf. I guess the title gives it away: ""The Girl's Guide to Surfing."" It's for girls, not women. Women--like men--need substance. And we need to learn to do what we do as independent individuals, not overgrown girls who have to be led by the hand amid constant encouragement and special treatment. The wave doesn't care about your gender."
2,Lesser Biography of Anna Anderson Manahan,"Lovell's work is clearly inferior to Peter Kurth's on the same subject. While Kurth relied on archival material, Lovell apparently preferred to focus on more bizarre aspects of the Anastasia claimant's story - in this case, the possibility that Nicholas and Alexandra had a 5th daughter. The fact that there is no evidence of this does not stop the late Mr. Lovell.This book is bound to disappoint both the supporters of Mrs. Manahan and those who accept the DNA evidence that she was not Anastasia. For the former, Lovell brings up matters and associations her supporters would have rather not seen published. For those who do accept the scientific evidence, this is a rather sad tale of a woman who wanted to be someone else."
3,sad,"Was ""Anna Anderson"" the Grand Duchess Anastasia? No; and there was a wealth of evidence proving that, long before the final blow of DNA testing, which the gullible and the credulous ignored. As the curious chronicle of a strange and eccentric woman, this book was a astonishing read...sorta. This sad story would be pathetically humorous were it not for the fact that it distracts us from the cruel reality of the brutal murder of a young girl by thugs along with the rest of her family. It is a shame that the real Anastasia is overshadowed, and ignored, by the charlatans that emerged after her murder. She is deserving of a better monument than that..."
1,Amusing...,"It's quite hilarious, what people will believe. I do not see why people contradict the DNA evidence and the fact that Anna Anderson didn't look at all like the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna. It's quite pathetic, this woman, a psychopath who grew into her role as the ""lost grand duchess"". There needs to be a better memoriam to the girl, not the crazy woman who said she was she. It's absolutely laughable, all the things he says in this book. It reads more like a tabloid, what with a secret fifth daughter and all this other junk."
1,A really bad book,"Although I believe Anna Anderson was the Grand Duchess Anastasia, I don't like this book. Most of this stuff is made up and it only seems to harm Anna's claim. Why did Mr. Lovell seriously go into research a sixth Romanov daughter, or did he at all? One is left to ponder if everything he writes about is a work or fiction I'm sorry to say. He should have been a mystery novel writer, not a history book writer.What makes Kurth's book better is that while he maintains Anna's claims were just, they are unprovable. Lovell's book goes out of the way to state between every line that it's been proven Anna Anderson was Anastasia which has certainly never been true."
4,An excellent collection of essays.,"Klemke admirably combines classic works with more contemporary approaches to the perennial philosophical problem of the meaning and significance of existence. The introductory essay and the division of the book into sections on the ""Theistic Answer"", ""The Non-Theistic Answer"", and ""Questioning the Question"" provide much-needed guidance for the reader grappling with the difficult issues raised by the authors. This second edition includes valuable new selections from Schopenhauer, Nielsen, Flanagan, and more. A great resource for both the professional philosopher and the amateur self-knowledge seeker."
3,"OK, but not the right speed","I bought this karaoke cd because I wanted ""You Move Me"" and this cd has it. I was excited to receive it and try it out. However, the speed of the song is off--it is too slow. I noticed that was the case on the other songs too--they ar ejust slightly slower than the real songs. If you have a karaoke machine that adjusts speed you'd be ok, but mine doesn't do that so overall I'm unhappy with it and wouldn't buy this again."
5,"Great food, high quality","I have been using this brand for 8 years. This is the first year we switched to the aging care at the recommendation of our vet. Noelle, my lil doggie, has always been fine with this brand with no stomach issues, a vibrant & healthy coat, and has maintained a healthy weight based on their recommended measurements. I like that it is geared towards her weight as well as giving her a little less calories in the aging formula. A+ for us!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY,I WAS REALLY EXCITED WHEN I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO- IT WAS HORRIBLE - IT DOESN'T FLOW EASILY - THE GUIDE KEEPS GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN GERI AND A BEGINNER AND SHE'LL FOCUS MORE ON THE BEGINNER AND BABY STEP YOU THROUGH THE SIMPLEST OF POSES AND THEN PAN THE CAMERA OVER TO GERI WHO'S INSTANTLY IN A MORE COMPLICATED POSE - BUT THEN THEY DON'T EXPLAIN HOW GERI GOT THERE...THIS VIDEO DOES NOT GIVE YOU A GOOD WORKOUT....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
1,"I agree...just stop talking, Geri!","I really wanted to like this dvd. But I have to say that I couldn't even make it through the first fifteen minutes By then I wanted to put a muzzle on both Geri AND the instructor. I kept telling myself to give it a chance but it just moves soooooo slowly while they talk and go over every detail of the next move. The other reviewer was right about being left twiddling your thumbs. I was so bored with this workout that I didn't even finish it and that is not like me. Usually once I start, I go ahead and do the whole thing whether I like it or not. I just couldn't take it anymore with this one. I had to stop. I only got through about twenty minutes of it. I did put it back in later to watch Geri's commentary at the end and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing at all ""enlightening"" in that section. Just more rambling....I'm really disappointed...like I said, I really wanted to like it...I know I won't ever do this workout again."
1,"A ""wannabee"" without real knowledge or experience","The storyline is quite fanciful. The many factual errors concerning US Navy SEAL organization, operations, equipment, and training reveal that the author's background could not be as stated.The strategy expounded (""Head of the Hydra"") is unworkable. The author fails to understand that the essential nature of organized crime is organization. Eliminating the heads of the drug trafficing organizations will not stop their operations."
1,tried really hard to like it,"The anti-drug moralizing forced me to stop reading it as did MANY technical goofs - 2 times where the author described M16s as having 40 round magazines, that a .357 Mag could penetrate a car's engine block, that most SEALs are built like NFL players and can bench 400 pounds.Drugs are evil but every good character in the book gets crocked on booze.Lots of typos and errors. This was like reading a first draft."
1,Good effort,"Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews of this book prior to purchasing it - I thought it was a factual accounting of US Navy Special Warfare efforts against the drug cartels. Had the author stuck with keeping this factual, it would have been a much more valuable read."
4,Very Good Album.,This CD was an excellent album by an artist I was not familiar with. In fact I bought it because Eric Clapton is a fetured artist etc. But the songs were really good.
4,Nice bundle,Bundle contained everything just didn't realize first game was so hard to work in DOS format. Crazy great game all around.
4,You will either hate it or love it.,"I ran into 'The Deity' by chance through a Google search. I was intrigued by the synopsis that referenced Islamic terror, the WTC and artificial intelligence. What a mix, I thought and ordered it. As a New Yorker who lived through 9/11, I felt that it might be interesting. This book is quite a read but requires focus because of the scientific content. It holds however a mirror into the face of humanity and provides a controversial view of religious history. The conversations are a bit lengthy but deep and contagious. The characters are so real they made me cry. In the last 50 pages the story twists twice in totally unexpected directions that will lift you off the seat. One of the best books I have read."
5,Cause and effect - SPOT ON!,"'Deity' - What a cool idea for a story. The inversion of cause and effect: it is not God who created us but we created God with our faith in him. I can't say more without giving the plot away. This is even better than 'Journey To Eden' which I read some time ago.Would the 'DaVinci Code', 'Satanic Verses' or 'The Passion of Christ' be anywhere as popular without the opposition they received? It makes you wonder, doesn't it?I wonder what causes this book will effect?"
3,A fiction novel should be fiction.,"The story is built on the premise that all the Middle East religions are responsible for the political and financial mess in the world today. It tries to be plausible and fictitious at the same time and that is not always working. Additionally, I can not ignore my religious belief while reading a book and thus I find some of it offensive.It is a pity that an author who can build such a complex and intricate storyline and strong characters, uses his skill to describe graphic sex and violence intermixed with religious concepts."
2,"If poor editing distracts you, don't bother with this one.","Okay, I'm no English teacher, but the sentence structure, misuse of words and poor punctuation are so distracting that I couldn't get past page 50. If only this author had utilized some help in editing his manuscript for publication! I was all set for cutting edge literature, and this was a real let-down. Hopefully, I'll have the patience one of these years to look past the shoddy grammar and enjoy this story as have so many other reviewers."
5,Far superior,If you've ever tried other aloe juices you get at GNC or other health food stores than you know how bitter they are. Georges Aloe tastes just like water to me. I use it for my leaky gut and IC issues and it helps tremendously.
3,Doesn't work for everyone,"I have had IBS and acid reflux for the majority of my adult life and have taken prescription medication (Nexium right now) for around 10 years. My wife bought this for me to see if it would help one or both problems. I was only able to take it for ten days, at 4 oz, twice a day before I started to have a generalized itchy rash on my arms and legs. I stopped on day 11 when I figured it out: i am probably allergic to aloe. Sure enough, the rash went away. Maybe if I had more time, it could have helped me, but there was no noticeable difference in any of my digestive problems for those 10 days. Tasted like water, so pleasant enough, but it just didn't do what I hoped."
5,Tastes neutral seems to work,We've found it works for us. Before we were limited on certain beverages and foods. Now sky is the limit we like it chilled
5,If you have Crohn .......this is a must!,"A friend of mine told me about liquid aloe, and refer me to Georges. I was heading towards surgery for Crohn's but after drinking aloe everyday a fantastic change has begun. I was down to one meal a day but now I can eat three. My system hasn't been this normal for years. I only drink 1/4 cup daily. It's made such a difference in my life."
5,Tastes like water!,"I don't like this product, I LOVE IT! It has really no taste at all except like really good water. My husband and I are trying it out for his eczema. And I heard it can work to help coprophagic dogs, so we are giving some to our dog. This is the best aloe vera drink available. It is expensive, but worth it!"
1,no good,made me sicker than a dog.....do not order this stuff it was toxic to me and felt real real bad
5,Great for Digestion,"I have heartburn troubles from time to time and was looking for an alternative to medication. I have tried other aloe products and was looking for one I could get for a better price. I love this stuff. The taste is almost like water, not strong at all and keeps me free of indigestion, heartburn, etc. I am not real good a drinking a little everyday, so when I have problems, I will drink half a cup or put it in my water to drink all day. This product is great and will help to clean your system too."
5,Cheapest I have ever found!,"We drink George's Aloe very regular in my house. THis is THE ONLY non bitter, virtually no taste at all so my children drink it and even as for it, no preservatives aloe found.To top it off, This is even cheaper than the cheapest local place I have found!!"
5,Product is Great,"I have to admit the product is great! What is upsetting is that I ordered the item, didnt think to look at the size. Got it, and it was the SMALLER64oz size instead of what I thought I clicked was gallon size."
4,Tastes just like water!,"I love taking Georges' Aloe, it tastes just like water. I took it for a whole month straight to see what if it gave me all the benefits of the other aloe veras I have tried, and yup it worked wonders. It was exactly what my digestive system needed. Overall I felt bette,more energy, better sleep, my stomach wasnt upset like before and best of all it tasted just like water. I would recommed. I only wish it was cheaper."
1,"Forget ordering this,,,, its a ripoff!!!!!!!","I ordered a gallon of this liquid..... and was sent only 1/2 gallon. I know specifically I clicked on the one gallon. Anyway I would have never spent 17.00 with shipping and handling on that little of an amount. Customer service denied that is what I ordered and of course I have revisited this site and the problem has been corrected. I have used this aloe ""miracle product"" and I was not impressed. I found a better alternative at the Xmas tree store in the health food isle for 5.99 with much better results. Plus I didnt have to pay for any shipping cost. I will NEVER buy another product from these clowns again."
3,Aloe vs. GERD,"I had hoped to go off prescribed medication and use the aloe instead for severe heatburn and acid indigestion. I lasted 4 days, then a little spicy lunch and I was vommiting for hours, so I'm back on the meds. Don't expect the aloe to relieve heatburn as it is touted to do."
1,"Tastes like water, because it is water.","I had tried AloeCure before I got this stuff and I concluded that Aloe was helpful to me. When I saw George's Aloe Vera I had high hopes for it as it had 5 stars which was very impressive and the price was much lower. One thing they claim is that it tastes like water. I've confirmed this fact, however I've also concluded that it smells like water, has the same consistency as water, transparency and even evaporates and doesn't leave any film at all, just like water. I've found no improvements with this product however with the other aloe I did. My conclusion, this is really a good deal for this much aloe, but I think it's because it's not aloe, it's actually water. Expensive water."
1,Not impressed,"Well, I tried this for heartburn and acid reflux. It worked for a couple of weeks, then not so much. I didn't really mean to get this huge jug,itmust have been in my shopping cart, and when I purchased something else, it was included. Hate that! Must be more careful next time."
3,Want extra exercises? This is the one.,"Do you own or plan to buy the ""Japanese for Busy People I: Revised 3rd Edition"" either in romanized or kana version? If you do, this is a pretty good choice if you want to do more exercises along with the lessons learned from the ""Japanese for Busy People I"". This workbook only provides more dialogue and listening exercises. Do not expect to see any grammar tips, culture notes, or even kana. If you do not have the ""Japanese for Busy People I"", you will not find this book helpful at all. All the dialogues in this workbook are written in romanized form, no kana. But that's ok, because this workbook only targets the dialogues and listening exercises. So, looking for extra homeworks? This is not a bad choice.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 12-May-2007)"
3,Phrasebook on steroids,"Pros:1. Reinforces the dialogues from the textbookCons:1. Romaji - I have the kana version of the textbook and I wish there was a kana version of this workbook2. Not a grammar workbook - This is a workbook for practicing the conversations presented in the textbook. I was expecting more grammar drills.Overall, it is a decent book with great printing and illustrations. But content-wise, I'm not so sure. I refer to it every now and then if I want to remember certain phrases. However, I can also do the same thing by opening the textbook.My recommendation: work through the textbook and skip this workbook."
2,not enough exercices,"The main book is great, but the workbook is very 'light'. For me, a workbook is where you can 'cram' more exercise, this one only contains a couple of exercices per chapter.There are actually more exercices in the main book than in the workbook.Otherwise, the few exercices are well designed and follow the main book."
2,Huh?,"I thought this was the Kana version, but a lot of the answers and exercises were in Romaji. I'm confused. Not as good as the text, and not nearly as useful or informative. I guess it's OK for supplemental material."
2,not what i expected- had to return it,"I desired a book that would be concise and teach a language the right way (how to say letters, conjegate verbs, etc.). This book has you jump right in to phrases. Also, a better title would be Japanese for busy business people, because these are the type of phrases that it taught you. This may be a good book if that is what you were using it for, but just not for me."
5,OPETH-Blackwater Park,"For all dark metal fans.OPETH is amazing.Blackwater Park will show you where intelligentmusicians can take you.This CD is the heaviest,most melodic CD you've ever heard.OPETH has to belistened to,they are hard to discribe.I can only tellyou to give OPETH a listen,and they will become yourfavorite band.You can listen to any of their CD's,theyare all awesome.Blackwater Park is my favorite.If youwant heavy,then this is the CD you should buy.You won'tregret it.OPETH plays a form of music that you've never heardbefore."
4,New Sound. Original.,I literally came across these guys by accident while on a file sharing service and the name caught my interest.These guys are good and I think this is the most original sound I have heard for some time.I would classify it as heavy and dark.Really professional and well done writing.Chief Joseph
5,This Is The Band's Most Comprehensive Effort,"This is not your typical Death Metal band. Everyone marvels at their ability to go from heavy to light, but listen to what they are doing with their LEFT hands. Maybe it's their lack of formal training, maybe it's just their desire to break new ground, but no one ever told them that what they do isn't supposed to work. Mikael kerfeldt is writing some of the most unique material available today. Everyone compares them with King Crimson rather than their Death Metal contemporaries for a reason, their song writing is that unique. These guys definitely know more than 3 chords and 2 speeds. For those that just can't deal with the the Death Metal growls, pick up a copy of Damnation ."
5,Masters of death metal,"I have listened to a few death metal bands in my day, and none quite compare to Opeth. Blackwater Park was the album that got me into death metal, because it is a perfect example of all that is great in death metal. The singer is amazing, when he growls, it is like a wall of sound, but his normal voice has a pure tone. The band plays very well, the sound is very solid, and very musical. Any death metal collection is missing a serious hole without Blackwater Park."
5,melodic and brutal all in one!!!!!!,By far the album of the year.I can't stop listening to it the combination and the way they wrote those songs is awsome!!!!
1,Thank god for Atreyu and Unearth,"Heh, this Opeth band calls itself Death metal, will you guys don't know what real death metal is.For true death metal from Scandanavia check out: Unearth, Atreyu, Bleeding Through, and Avenged Sevenfold."
4,Overall Pleased,"If you are purchasing this, than you already know. This is Blackwater Park, Opeth's masterpiece, on vinyl. It is beautiful, especially with a pre-amp and a bass boost. It is a great purchase, and I highly recommend it. The only thing that I was displeased with, was that the outter rim of the disc seemed to be peeling. Additionally, a little bit of this peeled vinyl was on the record, which I did not notice, and the record was popping. I was able to simply remove it, so it is of little consequence, but was still irritating."
4,Definitely up there,"This thing has my second favorite Opeth song of all time on it, Leper Affinity. It is my third favorite Opeth album (to MAYH and Deliverance) as it is a perfect viewing point to some of their heaviest stuff and some of their lightest stuff. Truly a piece of work. An opeth fan can't go without this thing. It has a little more variety than most of their other albums, which shows."
5,Opeth has done it again one great cd!!!!!,Simple put stop complaining dudes! This is one really excellent cd just because the band did not do other my arms! is that in it self a bad thing? HELL NO!!!!
3,"Very good, but not their best","OK, I've been a fan of Opeth since Morningrise, and they have yet to disappoint me. The first four songs on this album are absolutely phenomenal, but after that it tends to get just a bit too sleepy. Overall it's an excellent album, but I think a lot of the reviews I've read here are too caught up in the ""Oh my god a new Opeth album"" frame of mind to really judge it fairly. Anyway.. My Arms, Your Hearse is my personal favorite."
1,Thank god for Atreyu and As I lay Crying.,"Heh, this Opeth band calls itself Death metal, will you guys don't know what real death metal is.For true death metal from Scandanavia check out: Unearth, Atreyu, Bleeding Through, and Avenged Sevenfold."
2,Accoustic Metal?,"I bought this album because I really enjoyed ""Funeral Portrait"" a song on the album. It turned out to be the only song on the album that sounded like metal. Most of everything else on the album is acoustic. Which is fine if you like that sort of thing."
3,average,"i just had to hear this band after reading everyone's reviews about how they are musically the best band in the universe, etc. strangely, i did not come to this same conclusion. instrumentally, they are good, not great, and they do have an original sound. but those vocals, how can anyone stand that? it's hard to listen to the music with a distraction like that. it sounds like the lead ""singer"" is choking on a dick while trying to sing. recommended if you like death metal screams, because the band can play, but beware the vocals."
1,Great sound runied,"Are there any metal bands out there with such a wonderful rich sound to the band who don't ruin it by laying on those ridiculous growly ""vocals""??"
1,A for the music...F for vocal style...,"I am a huge fan of metal....I myself am an aspiring metal singer...thats right singer, not growler. Opeth is a very musically talented band, but the growling has just got to stop at all costs, that just ruins everything. Whoever decided that growling all the time sounds pleasurful to listen and requires talent (it takes little to none, and lets just see if those growlers can do that live when they're 50 years old) need to be shot and hung...listen to Rob Halford or Sebastian Bach, that is what a metal singer should sound like...growling is an absolutely and completely a joke and hopefully that ""metal trend"" will fade away asap."
5,I'm not worthy,"I've been avoiding writing a review for Blackwater Park for quite some time now. I could say how great it is, how it's their best album so far, how they transcend all other humans on a musical level, but that's all been said. Opeth is one of the most magnificent bands on Earth, so I'll just leave it at that."
5,GENIUS,"What we have here, my friends, is a work of genius. These fellows' abilities match those of avid classical musicians I have heard. Each song is a unique piece of art; the song structures vary, the song lengths vary, the styles vary. It is heavy, beautiful and unique. This is the very musical portrait of bleakness in one of its many forms; listening to this conjures up images of the ancient houses featured on so many of their album covers. You can practically smell the must!Sadly, I don't especially care for tracks five and six as much as the rest, but that can easily be forgiven. I have heard four of the songs on Deliverance, and shockingly I like them even more...a review for certain when I finish listening to it."
5,Contrast is Divine,"And this band uses contrast to the point of driving any listener to pure ecstacy. This highly talented Sweedish band combine brutal but very organized and progressive death metal, along with metal growling vocals, but also mixes in light beautiful, solemn acoustic and ""clean"" areas complete with wonderful singing and orchestration and playing from the whole band.The songs are all very complex arangements, way to complex and orchestrated for a metal band. But this just isn't any metal band. Opeth songs average around 10 minutes each. But a few songs are around 7 on this album and one about 1:30 (an instrumental leading to the title track).It maybe hard for some fans of progressive rock to get past the growls of Michael, but if you do you will be treated to a very powerful band that makes contrasting styles into one pure, divine, work of art.Enjoy!"
4,An Amazing Sequel,GK2 is an excellent companion to the GK2 game. Ms. Jenson gives you an unexpected mixture of fact and fiction that keeps the story alive and real.I also found by reading this book that the part of Ludwig II becomes clearer than what is was in the game (to me anyway). I certainly look forward to the 3rd book in the series!
4,Addictive work of art...AGAIN,"After playing Gabriel Knight 1, reading the book, playing most of Gabriel Knight 2, I picked up this book. I couldn't put it down. It inspired me to boot up GK2 again and after the final scene I just sat back in awe. A well written story that keeps the reader excited and hooked, the only flaws are small and hardly noticeable. Excellent book."
1,Best of the 4-Volume Set but....,"This is the best starting book for anyone who wants to delve into hypnosis. But it is often available as used book only and is the first in a 4-vol set. But soon (sometime in early 2006), there will be a 8-vol (yes, 8 books in a set) set in a single CD that also comes with audio and bonus video and at $75!Back about this book... It tells you experiments and findings of tests conducted on hypnotized subjects and how they react to suggestions by the ""hypnotizer"" and also what happens when they are told to do things (while in trance) that they would not do in normal consciousness.The sections on Trance and Suggestions are excellent; perhaps the best OVERVIEW of trance and how suggestions work.Much of the material is suitable for a hypnotherapist to use in a pre-talk to trance induction."
2,This book,made me not want to be a vegan. This is more of a story that foretells your depressing future as a hated person in society... Please go for cook books and real stories-veganism isn't that bad. The book blows everything out of proportion.
3,Good Info but couldn't get into the writing style,"The authors have provided some good solid info about what it means to be vegan and dealing with vegan snafus such as; how to handle obnoxious anti-vegan attitudes, eating on the road and vegan friendly ethnic cuisine. There is also good info about how to identify nonvegan ingredients in food, cosmetics and other products. That said, I just couldn't get into the writing style. It's as if they're trying so hard to be cool but can't quite pull it off so it seems more condescending and self-conscious. I didn't understand the random put-downs of ""middle-aged ex-hippie types"". Would these be the same people who paved the way for us modern day vegans??? Such remarks have nothing to do with being vegan and distracted from the overall focus of the book."
3,Vegan Freak,"Not quite what I expected. It is written for a younger, more hip, audience. It is hard to believe that the two authors have PhDs.The information is pertinent, and there are pages of ressources inthe back of the book."
3,Kind of Condescending,"I bought this book hoping for helpful advice on how to deal with my omnivore friends and family.Though the book has some good advice, the way it is written makes it seem condescending, and I don't agree with some of the author's opinions or attitude at some parts.Aside from advice, (which can go anywhere from actually helpful advice on what to do when eating out and dealing with coworkers, to not so helpful advice to just ignore family or get new friends,) there is a lot of vegan information, though the same information can be found in any number of other vegan books."
2,The first version was better,"Why did Bob and Jenna rewrite this book? I loved the first version and have read it so many times I practically have it memorized. My quibble with this version is not that it's different, it's just that it's not any better. It's more preachy and less entertaining. Bummer. Buy the first edition if you can still get your hands on it; it's really persuasive and fun to read. In this one they come off as judgmental a-holes, which is completely off-putting. As someone who basically AGREES with them, I felt attacked and insulted -- I can't even imagine what an omnivore would feel like picking up this book. I returned it and will stick with the first version."
1,"I may agree with it, but that doesn't mean its a good book","Terribly written, not interesting - more info from any internet faq on veganism. Spends more of its time giving links/references to books that might be useful, but this book on its own has very little value or worthwhile information that hasn't been given so many times before in such better books."
3,For beginners; non-n00bs should listen to the podcast,"I'd been vegan for about 8 years when I read this book. It was amusing and I liked the style (I, for one, love making fun of overaged hippies; their belief that they invented social progress can be pretty annoying.) But there's not much in it for experienced vegans.Bob and Jenna are still pretty great, tho'. You should really download their VeganFreak Radio podcast."
3,Good For New Vegans,"Being a vegan myself I couldn't resist picking up this book and giving it a read. If you're new to veganism, thinking about becoming a vegan or just want to know more about the topic then I would recommend this book for you. However, if you are already a vegan don't bother with this book as you won't learn anything you didn't already know. It does cover various issues that vegans deal with whether it be dealing with the arguments for ethical veganism, how to get along with family, friends, and others, including other vegetarians, practical tips for traveling, shopping, and living as a vegan and how to respond when people ask you if you ""like, live on apples and twigs"". As I said, if you've been a vegan for a while now nothing in this book will be new to you so you may want to see if your local library has it in stock."
2,not sure what about this one.,"I read this book and liked it's style and the information was helpful but I feel like the authors need to revise this book and try a little harder to cut down on the opinions and repetitive info and instead pack in more of their valuable advise. I'm not sure how to better explain this but I will illustrate how I read this book. I Read the whole thing really fast first of all, and when i got to the end I was shocked it was over. So I thought maybe I missed a chapter or two. So I skimmed back through it searching for the lost chapters, but they were not there. I was so desperate for more that I read the appendix over and over searching for more info. I guess I fell that this book is incomplete"
1,only for Freaks,"I enjoy being a vegetarian, and aspire to be a vegan in my eating habits for health reasons etc. I do not care for animal cruelty and support organizations to further the health and caring for animals. I purchased this book to learn more about the Vegan lifestyle but unfortunately trying to read this book is like trying to learn to swim by jumping off the high-dive. This book most definitely is for Vegan Freaks, it defines itself well because the rabid veganism it contains is just frankly, scary.I couldn't get past 10 pages without just putting it down...hey if anyone knows someone who wants a lightly used copy..let me know. (I like to recycle too)"
2,Judgemental,"If you're already vegan you will probably like this book. If you're thinking about becoming vegan don't base your opinions of all vegans on this author. From the first page he says that we can't be judgemental toward those who are merely vegetarians or, God forbid, meat-eaters. Yet he is continually judgemental throughout the entire book, making himself look like a pompous jackass.There is a fact or two thrown in amid the opinions, but I would look elsewhere for real information. Becoming Vegan by Brenda Davis is a great source, and a much gentler place to start."
2,FAIL: This book made me start eating seafood again,"I had been an ovo-lacto vegetarian for three years when I picked up this book. Since I'd become vegetarian by reading convincing arguments about animals, the environment and my health, I'd hoped that this book--by former ovo-lactos turned vegan--would contain the right arguments to help me commit to becoming vegan.Instead, I came to feel that if I were eating cheese, I might as well be eating veal. So, I returned the book to Borders and made salmon for dinner. This book made me LESS committed to vegetarianism than I was BEFORE reading it. I don't suppose that was the Torres' original intent. Too bad."
4,(Heart) Freaks,"Vegan Freak: Being Vegan in a Non-Vegan World.I could have used this book years ago! I've been vegan for only 11 months, but if I had've had this book years ago I would've stopped my procrastinating, stopped making excuses and just gone vegan!As I have already been living vegan, quite a lot of the content didn't apply to me as they do spend a lot of the book spelling out the reasons to be vegan.I think this book is perfect for anyone who is considering going vegan, or is having trouble with their already vegan lifestyle. Be warned though, they sugar-coat nothing! We're talking, straight shooting, no-nonsense people hell bent on turning the world vegan!What are you waiting for?! Buy the darn book! :)"
2,Too Smug!,"I bought this and other books about veganism after switching to a plant-based diet. Yes, this book has some useful information, but the authors are irritatingly smug. I don't eat animal products, but I am not an animal rights activist and don't plan to become one. My reasons for eating vegan are more complex than that. For me, it's mostly politics (refusing to support bad corporate behavior), and to a lesser degree ethics/animal rights, and a small part health. The authors kind of make me dislike vegans, or at least roll my eyes, which is funny considering my lifestyle. In any event, this is probably a terrific book for animal rights focused folks, but for those who want to eat a plant-based diet because it's better for the world and the animals and your health, I suggest The Kind Diet or The Veganist. They are way less preachy and far more welcoming to the mainstream."
3,Repetetive and Only Semi-Informational,"While this book was an easy read (you could probably finish in a day depending on your free-time) it is not at all what I thought it would be. I was expecting good advice on how to survive as a vegan in our non-vegan world (hmm where could I have gotten that idea?) but all the advice was VERY general. As others have said, they reference other books and websites on nearly every page, basically telling you to read other work if you want the whole story. Finally, even as an ovo-lacto vegetarian looking to make the switch to veganism, I really didn't find much I didn't already know. The beer section was informative, but I don't drink. I suppose this book would be best for someone that doesn't know much of anything about AR or the vegan diet. The most I got out of it was a new reading list."
2,Reads like a high school book report,"Being new to veganism, I thought this book would be a good buy. Although it had a few good tips, it mostly references other books. There are a LOT of sentences like ""For more information on this read (insert book title here)"". It seems I could have learned more (maybe better?) information by not wasting money on this but buying the books they keep quoting lines from."
1,Vegan Freak Turns Vegans Away,"I am a long time vegan, and I would normally support a project like this, but I have found the veganfreak.net site that accompanies the book to be very unfriendly and unwelcoming. They do not try to help, they turn you away in ridicule if you come asking questions they don't like. I don't like the tone of the book or the authors' (or whoever they have running veganfreak) attitude. Thanks for turning this vegan away and leaving an extremely bad taste in my mouth! You are doing more harm than good."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this book thinking it would hold something worthwhile... but it didn't. It was too short, too light on info... I felt like I was reading the cliff notes to veganism- what substance there was, I felt was recycled from other academics and animal rights figures.I gave my copy away because there was no point in keeping it. You'll get more use out of googling ""vegan"" and ""animal rights""."
1,Money better spent on Beans and Rice.,"The writers of this book are very repetitive about their opinions on animal rights. They do not give many tips on ""being vegan in a non vegan world."" They apparently believe that the only reason to be vegan is for animal right and that those who are vegan for other reasons....such as their health, have just not figured out the only ""good reason"" to be vegan. I feel that any reason to be vegan should be considered a good reason, and the more the merrier. I was hoping for tips on eat with family and the like, but really wasn't given any ideas I had not already thought of. I am an avid reader and usually read everything I can get my hands on about a given topic and I must let you know that this is the first time I have felt the need to share such a negative opinion of a book."
2,Nice idea; poor execution,"This watch promised a lot, and delivers a little. I lost my previous G shock Casio, and decided to replace it with this solar powered watch to avoid the future need for batteries. (Plus it looked cool). so far so good.But...the solar pholtaic charger is puny, and the watch often runs out of juice. Which means you get a blank screen until you stick it under a light for half an hour and recharge it. This has happened even in the summer, which is strangem because in Seattle the summer is often sunny.I tried calling custmer service, but there is no category for watches, and I could never contact anyone.(I admit I am impatient). But be careful before buying this watch."
5,"It ain't beautiful, but it's every bit as good as advertised.","I destroyed watches on an annual basis until about 5 years ago when I bought a version of this watch. Ocean swimming, chemical splashes, sports, bumping into brick walls, whatever. It's just plain indestructible. I haven't even scratched the mineral crystal.Don't worry about the review that says it doesn't hold a charge. It sort of gains strength over time if you don't use the backlight too much.Beware of paint spatter, its one weakness. It sticks to the watchband like crazy, and I've yet to find a suitable replacement band."
3,Casio Solar Sports Watch,"First, let me say this is one of two identical watches I purchased. The first runs like a champ! The second one has issues. I gave the first watch to my dad and it runs like a house-afire. The one I kept for myself goes blank; resets itself and sometimes fails to respond to commands. I don't know why this is but it'll have to go back to Casio for service."
4,great watch,I bought this watch for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves it and it's great because he is going into the police academy and this watch has military time on it. It is also great because it saves the battery when not in use. Overall it was a great buy!!
2,I Returned Mine,"The countdown timer has a maximum of 60 minutes. How silly. The power meter is hard to read. Also, why did they waste space on the display with the year? Who needs that?Not me."
2,NOT TOUGH AT ALL!,"THE DISPLAY ON THIS WATCH IS PRETTY GOOD. NUMBERS ARE CLEAR. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM ARE THE BUTTONS ARE HARD TO USE. ANOTHER IS THAT THE WATCH DOESNT REALLY FEEL ALL THAT COMFORTABLE ON ONES WRIST, MAYBE I HAVE SMALL WRIST. ALSO THE WATCH DESIGN LOOKS TO BE A LITTLE bit FEMININE. BUT THE MAIN ISSUE WITH THIS WATCH ARE THE BUTTONS!!!"
5,Great Buy,"Bought the watch cheaper here on Amazon, received it within 2 weeks, and have not had a problem with it ever since. Great buy."
5,Sharks hat,"The Sharks hat was great quality, and just as pictured. The flex fit is a nice feature, and makes the hat look polished. The shipping was fast and accurate, most appreciated."
4,reasonably priced,I have 6 of these cases both blue and black. I use them to store a large dvd-r collection. They are perfect for this because they are far less expensive than the other brands and hold a lot of dvds. They are not as nice as the other brands because they are plastic and not leather but the quality is perfectly adequate. I have not had a problem with any of the cases. If you are like me and believe that $30 or so is way too much to spend for something as mundane as a cd case then this is the brand for you.
5,EXTREMELY OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS A VERY, VERY GOOD BUY THIS WILL BE MY SECOND PURCHASE AND JR CO. ARE WONDERFUL, they SHIP EXTREMELY FAST, THIS CO. IS THE BOMB= VERY VERY GOOD! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, FOR THE PRICE U CANNOT BEAT IT JACK. BUY BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR!!pros: outstanding quality, durability, holds disc with no problemsowned my 1st one for about 3 months now and already full! works like a charm!! binding velcro like material grips the binders firmly, NOT THE NON-DEPENDABLE BINDER clip, fasten and TEAR CRAP.Cons: ONLY THING IS THAT ONCE NEAR FULL, FLIPS """"WIDE"""" OPEN WHEN U OPEN THE WALLET. DUE TO THE LIGHT-WEIGHT COVER'S MASS GOING AGAINST THE MAIN TOTAL MASS OF THE OCCUPIED BINDERS. but that's just basic/ all-the-time physics folks. NOT A PROBLEM, WORKS GREAT, NO MAJOR COMPLAINTS!, GREAT SHIPPING RELIABILITY, GOOd CUST. SERV. HANDS DOWN!"
1,Shoddy,"The timly shipping of this item was good; however, when I finally did wear this item it split all the way from my arm down to the base. The material and workmanship of this jacket is VERY poor. I would say not to even waste your time buying it, because you will end up having to buy another soon. So spend you money on a better more expensive jacket."
4,Thanks for simplifying Physics,This is an excellent textbook. This book is easier to understand than my current textbook. I highly recommend it for everyone.My advisor is trying to obtain a copy for the LRC that he is building
4,Early Calvino,"I can't share the same enthusiasm for these tales as so many other reviewers have expressed. These stories are only hints of the brilliance Calvino exhibits in his later tales. The two parable-like novellas are based on far-fetched premises (a Calvino trademark) -- the first an empty suit of armor that acts as the exemplary knight out of sheer will power; the second a viscount halved in combat into two surviving entities. It is fun to ponder the implications of these stories, particularly the story of the perfect knight who is physically non-existent but coheres through act of will, yet who lacks whatever it is that we call humanity. The Cloven Viscount is a more mundane and predictable tale that employs the old good-evil, id-ego, left-brain-right-brain paradigm. These stories offer an interesting glimpse into the developing genius that manifests itself more fully and artfully in Baron in the Trees, Cosmicomics, and Invisible Cities."
3,Free SF Reader,"This is the classic children's fairy story. A young boy has themisfortune to be rather more than extremely vertically challenged. Heonly manages inches, rather than feet. When misfortune and troublestrikes, this littlest of humans must find a way to help everyone."
4,Ploesti and Into the Fire,"For complete knowledge of the Ploesti raid, ""Into the Fire"" by Duane Schultz is a must read prior to sinking your teeth into the excellent depiction of ""Ploesti- The Great Ground-Air Battle of 1 August 1943"" by James Dugan& Carroll Stewart.Both books describe the same courageous, yet doomed, Romanian oil field bombing mission. However you get the benefitof two different perspectives.I also recommend : the DVD ""Wing & a Prayer:The Saga of Utah Man"" as well as the article"" Red Cross Girl Overseas "" by Margaret Cotter-National Geographic Magazine December 1944.All the above gave me an overwhelming admiration and respect for the 1943 Servicemen and Servicewomen who sounselfishly gave all to our beloved country."
3,Then it was possible to produce this book,"I read this regular book, here in Brazil.This book is about the bomber destruction against Ploesti oil fields, in Romania, during World War II.To produce this book, the authors had to do, more than two hundreds interviews and made a lot of research in primary sources.They made interviews, not just with Americans, but also with Germans,Romanians,etc.Today is impossible to produce this kind of book.Almost everyone with good informations, about World War II isn't alive today.The failure of this book is to be very long.This book is for experts, about this bombing, not for common persons, such as me."
4,KEITH B.,"A VIVID RETELLING OF ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING & DARING AIR BATTLES OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR. SINCE I FIRST LEARNED OF THIS MISION WHEN I WAS A TEEN, IT HAS ALWAYS FASCINATED ME AND IT'S ALL THE MORE COMPELLING WHEN YOU REALIZE MOST OF THE FLYERS KNEW ""COMING BACK WAS SECONDARY"". MORE CONGRESSIONAL MEDALS OF HONOR WERE AWARDED ON THIS MISION THAN ON ANY OTHER SINGLE MISSION AND IT FILLS ME WITH PATRIOTIC PRIDE TO READ SUCH ATHOROUGH ACCOUNT OF ""Operation Tidal Wave""."
5,Best book ever,"This book is aboout a common school girl, Julia Johnson, who finds her down and out almost twin, Carina, the princess of Vineland. Carina asks Julia to switch places for a day, and she offers her 10 grand for it. By the end Julia has fallen in love with the guy she is supposed to hate, and Carina in stuck in a bus with a drunken rock band."
2,Predictable,"I thought The Princess and the Pauper was an OK book, however, it was a bit predictable in that way. Of COURSE they both find gorgeous guys, of COURSE everything turns out alright in the end, of COURSE they find out that being a princess/normal isn't as easy as it looks. It was a bit TOO predictable actually, because I was expecting more substance in this book; maybe something that was a bit more original. Perhaps I thought this because I had seen a movie recently with pretty mcuh the same storyline, and also it was too much like The Princess Diaries, which was, by the way, good, but it was also one of the first big princess stories. The Princess and the Pauper seemed to me a bit of a ""wanabe"" Princess Diaries."
3,A combo of The Princess Diaries and The Parent Trap&#65533;.kinda,"Doesn't it always seem like the other side has it better? Carina, crown princess of Vineland, seems to think so. When she comes to LA to give a speech at her grandmother's old school, she plans to sneak away from her handler and meet up with Ribbit, a ""rock star"" she met on the internet. When Carina figures out this is impossible, she thinks all hope is gone, until she runs into Julia Johnson, who's at the swanky private school on scholarship. Except for differing hair colors, the girls look remarkably alike, and once Carina offers Julia $10,000 to swap places for one night, Julia figures she can use the money to play the rent on the apartment she shares with her mother. The only problem is, the next morning Carina ends up in Texas, and Julia finds out she's falling for Markus, Carina's beau. It's a cute story, with extra twists to make it stand out from the crowd."
3,ummmm,"I got this book because the whole story line about two girls meeting and switching places couldn't be to bad. Not that the story was bad, it was actualy O.K. but i just couldn't get a feel for it because the writing seemed a little *off(?) So it's basically about a princess from Vineland who comes to America for a little sight seeing, but while she's there she wants to meet up with some rock singer guy who she meet online, but she can't just go out and meet him (besause she's a princess) so she switches places with a poor girl who looks like her. One thing leads to another and the wrong girl ends up going back to Vineland, where she meets a guy and *falls in love* (in one night, yah right)blah blah blah then the mothers find out and the two girls have to switch and everyone ends up happy."
5,The Princess and the Pauper,"I really loved this book. I give it two thumbs up. When I was halfway through this, I was hoping it would end up being a romance of sorts. Don't ask me why. I don't know. Anyway, everyome ended up happy in the end. If you want to know what happens, you'll just have to read it for yourself."
3,pretty good.......,"the book was pretty enjoyable and if u love princess books then i kno you'd like to get your hands on ""the Princess and the Pauper"". there are certain lines of hilarity in the book and also bits of witticism. the ending is too mushy and the story suddenly turns dramatic at the end but the rest is very good and interesting and well-written. it's also simple to read. there are about two parts where i almost got tears in my eyes cause it was upsetting but it doesn't make the story dramatic at all. all the characters are very attractive."
2,Horrible,"Absolutely horrible. I was expecting something akin to The Princess Diaries, but this author just doesn't know how to write. If incorrect grammar and wordiness don't both you, then you might enjoy this novel. However, the plot is unoriginal and slow. This book could have been written using half as many pages- that's how many extra words there are. And forget funny. Again, very unoriginal: characters and events are cliché; author relies on decription of being a princess rather than being a teenager as the Diaries do. Uninteresting. Couldn't wait to give it away."
4,Alicia Sirois's review,"I liked the book because it had a lot of adventure. I especially liked it when Julia was pretending to be Catrina, the princess of Vineland, and got flown to Vineland as Catrina. while Catrina was stuck on a van going to Texas.Catrina wanted to go to a rock concert and her parents wouldn't let her because she was the princess of Vineland. Ingrid, Catrina's friend, saw a girl named Julia and noticed that she looked exactly like Catrina and had an idea to switch them. It worked for a while until Julia got shipped off to Vineland and Catrina was on a bus that was going to Texas. They wouldn't pull over.I would recommend this book to 13 year olds or 14 year old girls because it is kind of a romantic book, although it has some adventure in it. Also has some things like people talking about smoking which may not be appropriate for little kids."
5,cute new twist on an old classic,"Princess Carina of Vineland has always wanted to see America, so she's thrilled when she gets to go to L.A. There's just one problem: Her eagle-eye caretaker won't let her out of her sight, and she wants to meet her cyber-boyfriend, a hot American rocker. His concert is the same night as a ball, though, so she'll never be able to go. Then she meets Julia, her American look-alike. Carina offers to pay Julia ten grand to trade places with her for one day, and Julia readily accepts. How hard can it be? But then Julia gets Carina's face in the tabloids, and Carina ends up stranded in Arizona while Julia jets back to Vineland. This is a twist on the classic, The Prince and the Pauper, with some surprising twists. It was funny, and I really enjoyed it."
1,Mediocre socks,"I bought these due to problems with blistering while on the treadmill. I was disappointed. While they are fluffy and comfortable, they bunch up easily when you walk briskly and were no better than regular Hanes socks in that regard. I ended up with blisters again."
5,Truly a miracle for me.,"I get blisters. Just walking in the mall, I get blisters. Shoot, if I walk around the house, I get blisters. Everywhere, no matter what shoes, no matter socks or not.EXCEPT when I wear these socks. I bought a couple pairs a while ago, and I liked them, but I've recently started a walking program, and was afraid they wouldn't hold up - but they've been amazing. No rubbing, no blistering, no burning sensations - nothing. Incredibly comfortable, supportive, and perfect thickness for my sneakers.I cannot recommend these highly enough."
5,Great Socks,"I am plagued with wicked blisters whenever I walk or run more than 45 minutes, so I got these socks to see if they would make any difference while I am training for a marathon relay. I still have some friction on the bottoms of my feet, but nothing like before, and no new blisters on my last 60 minute interval training session. The socks are well made, nice and soft inside, and didn't affect how my shoes fit - I was afraid the extra padding would make my shoes tight, but that didn't seem to be the case. I will definitely pick up a few more pairs."
3,Thorlo Socks,"These are great socks, but I expected a thinner material. They are very warm, better for winter than in the Las Vegas summers."
2,Keep searching,"Although it is nice that the folks described in this book were able to live to ripe old ages, the tome does not share this so-called fountain of youth with the rest of us thirsty readers. If there were some hidden secrets here, I did not discover them, and as I continue to age like the rest of society, I will continue my search for the fountain Ms. Falkner wrote of."
5,Loved this Indian adventure,"I loved so many things about this book: Bacon's illustrative and lovely writing style, keeping a plot while not losing elegant writing and description; the two different narratives about the daughter and mother are both engaging and smoothly alternated, the stories told within the story, the Indian backdrop - which made me really want to travel to India - and even the minor characters, the brother, the dad. A lovely, beautiful novel I was sad to finish."
5,This is a Must,"This is a must, I have it distributing power to an MB Quart ONX4.80 4-channel amp and an MTX TA3401 Class D mono amp. Nice digital display, tells you how many volts you're feeding your amps. Nice solid construction."
3,Inconsistency in data and too many typos,"It is overall a readable book. However the inconsistency in data and many typos indicate that this is not a book based thorough research. The author and editors probably have rushed to get it published.There are many places where it should be ""than"" instead of ""then"". On page 173 it says ""In 1999, while the Nasdaq Composite rose more than 80 percent, Tiger was down nearly 18 percent"". Next on page 174, ""And 1999, of course, was worse. Tiger lost 19 percent, a firm 40 percent behind the S&P; 500"". On page 253, in the Tiger record table, 1999 return is ""19.0"", with the sign missing. How could the author even have the performance numbers wrong?"
2,Mediocre,A reviewer inquires as to why there are so many negative reviews. The reason is that this is not a very good book. I found it fluffy and written in a stilted and amateurish fashion. It did not tell me anything about Julian Robertson that I did not already know.
1,Dont waste your time,Horribly written. No sequence or point. I can't imagine Robertson gave the author more than 20 minutes of access and didnt answer a real question. Contradictions abound.Save yourself time and money. One of the worst books I've read in a while.
1,Thinly written,"Robertson obviously is a legend an innovater in the hedge fund space, but the author rarely gives you any true original insight. I respect Robertson for what he did, and his investing returns, but unfortunately with over 10,000 hedge funds in existence, a lot of the mispricings he traded on are gone. Many of his proteges have gone on to produce great returns, but I think a lot of their success is due to the Tiger Brand. One only has to look at Dwight Andersen from Ospraie, whose fund blew out in the greatest bull market in commodites this century. Ospraie couldnt even beat the indices.. The Goldman Sachs Commodity and CRB, nice job if you can get it right, underperform in your industry and make 11 figures."
1,Easily the worst book I have ever read,"I am not kidding. A drunk retarded 3rd grader could have written a better book. If you like poor editing of terrible writing that introduces absolutely nothing new about Robertson or Tiger, then this book is for you. Otherwise just read some old articles and save a couple hours and 20 bucks. The only reason it got one star is that Amazon does not allow a reviewer to give negative stars, of which Strachman certainly has earned many for this effort (or lack thereof)."
1,Really bad,"This book is absolute garbage. I made the mistake of picking this book to read for a class on management. I couldn't find anything of value in it, so to get the info I needed I went to the library and looked at the stories that came out on Robertson. There it all was, laid out for me.I actually got MORE from any one of the magazine pieces I read than I did from this book!Also I discovered from reading the articles that Robertson was sunk by an overconcentration in several stocks, including U.S. Airways. That isn't even mentioned in this book, so obviously I wasn't going to get more on that subject. I wonder if the author did any research before writing this book. It reads as if it was produced by some p.r. guy."
1,A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,A WASTE OF TIME. A WASTE OF MONEY. MANY TREES KILLED FOR NO GOOD REASON. AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAGUE!!
1,Trash,"A superficial, mind-numbingly stupid love song to the controversial fund manager who up-ended in early 2000. Every mistake justified or ignored, every act of hubris minimized. Absolute garbage that must surely go down in history as one of the worst business books of recent years."
2,Durable but potentially dangerous pool toy,"Buyer beware with this igloo. It's ok, but you had better stay right there every minute and watch the children. If the float is upside down, it can be difficult for the kids to get out. I worried constantly that a small leak would make it sink, encapsulating the child and pulling him/her down with it as it sank. I took sissors to it and placed it in the trash. With liability what it is these days, save your money and your nerves. Skip this one.Kak from Deatsville"
4,Sounds Like The Chords?,"OK I'm totally naive to SLF. I was trying to see what Bruce Foxton of the Jam fame was up to and it looks like him on the cover. Anyway I played the samples and they sound like The Chords, I'm wondering if SLF picked up the singer from that old group also? Who knows, no reviews here so no one must care. Pity, see ya Bruce!"
3,Listenable but spotty.,"Not the best CD Diana Ross has ever released, but it is very listenable for the most part. Best Track : I Thought We Were Still In Love. Standouts: Let Somebody Know, Take Me Higher. Many other good cuts, but avoid Don't Stop and Swing It (on the import version). Some of the vocals are more spirtited than a lot of her 90s work, but too many of the tracks suffer from a very laid-back vocal approach. Hers is not the strongest voice to begin with, but she has sung with much more commitment and strength in the past (Swept Away, Tell Mama, The Boss, Going Down For The Third Time, God Bless America-Live). Also, while there is a somewhat contemporary approach to some of the production, this is really an album for an older market and not the one to make an impact on younger CD buyers in their teens/twenties). Also, while the album is pleasant, it does not in any way (re)establish Diana Ross as a relevant musical force."
3,"Decent, but nothing earth-shattering","I bought this CD obviously for the dance hits ""Take Me Higher"" and ""I Will Survive,"" which are the only two songs on the album that got any pop airplay (I've heard ""Gone"" on some adult stations but that's about it). Also, those two songs are the only real energetic songs on the album- the rest of it is ballads and weak R&B/Hip-hop songs that just aren't very good in general. You'd think that the fact that the only radio success Diana Ross seems to have had lately are her dance numbers would be a clue to do more of it, but I guess she has other plans. My advice is to either get this CD used or find the two songs on a compilation. Aside from them, the album is mediocre at best."
2,Tepid,"Great photo display inside, but the music is a yawn. The best cut (and almost worth the price of admission) is Let somebody know. What we did not need is another cover of I will survive. Some advice, get Ashford and Simpson back."
1,THIS ITEM WAS SOLD TO ME THROUGH A SELLER AND I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED AT THE CONDITION OF THE CD,THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE FOR ME I WAS NOT HAPPY AT ALL IN THE SHAPE THIS CD WAS IN I DON'T BLAME AMZON FOR THIS I BLAME MYSELF BUT YOU LIVE AND LEAN BUYER BEWARE OF PRIVATE SELLERS.
1,Stay away from this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Every one complains that Motown is not promoting Diana Ross. I'm surprised they don't just DUMP her. She hasn't released anything decent since ""The force behind the Power"" in 1991. Probably Motown and EMI think of her like an old horse. You shouldn't dump it after a life of hard work...Her deal with motown (and EMI for the rest of the world) is CHARITY !!!!"
3,Gotta like weird stuff,It's a good album as long as you're in the mind set to appreciate something different. It's an album of alternative country if there is such a thing. The singer's whiney but the band and lyrics make the cd interesting. Galapagos is a sweet tune.
3,"somewhat helpful, BUT...","In my opinion, this book focuses too much on people who are vegetarians because of their strong animal rights convictions. I became a vegetarian simply because I believe it is healthier, so a lot of the things in this book were not helpful to me.I bought this book because I find myself being put on the defensive quite often when people learn I am a vegetarian, and was hoping it might contain insight as to how to avoid (or handle with grace) those types of situations. It helped a little, but not as much as I expected.If I was a stronger advocate of animal rights, I would probably relate more to the attitudes and scenarios portrayed in this book. I am all for animal rights, but it has nothing to do with why I don't eat meat.I disagree with the author's opinion that all meat-eaters are ""blocked vegetarians"". That, to me, seems like a self-righteous attitude."
1,Got a refund.,"I had high hopes for this book, but was quickly turned off and ended up returning it to the store. The author's condescending attitude promotes a number of the ideas behind the negative stereotype many people have of vegans today."
1,Useless book,"This is a useless book.It tries to come up with rational responses to rational questions posed to vegetables by meat eaters ... while ignoring the fact that vegetarianism itself is irrational and unnatural.It's like having a book for alcoholics about how to live with people who are not drunks, and how to provide excuses/rationalizations about your alcoholic lifestyle to those who have not adopted it."
4,Good advice,"I have not yet finished reading this book but so far I have enjoyed it greatly. As a vegetarian for fifteen years I found many cookbooks and and other instructional aids to becoming a vegetarian but this is the first book I have found that deals more with the social aspect of vegetarianism. I adopted a vegetarian diet for many reasons and one of them is to promote peace for all creatures, humans included. This book helps show how to deal with those with different viewpoints without feeling angry or exhausted. I recommend this book especially for the vetran vegetarian."
4,What to Dodo and Dido have in common? Both are extinct...,"It started out as a school assignment. It finished as an amazing read. The detail, the blood, the gore... Better than most modern novels..."
3,There's still Paris. . .,"Andre waited 50+ years to write this book and I waited 20+ years to read it. It is with pure sadness that I state that, in this case, there is no more than meets the eye. What a surprise to learn that Mr. Talley is so one-sided; even the models on the pages of Vogue have 2 dimensions! One gets the distinct sense that a great deal was held back; God bless the editors who obviously had to pull teeth to get anything from him. Ghost writer? I am arguably THE biggest fan of Mr. Talley's StyleFax column and my only hope is that, in the spirit of Richard Rodriguez, this is the first in a series of works about his great life."
2,Not as good as the other books in the series,"I have read books one , two (this book Warrior's heart) and book three of this series. I thought book one and three were good - really good - but I had a hard time with this book. The conflict in the book felt contrived to me and I had a hard time keeping focused on the story - the book just couldn't hold my attention, in spite of the fact that I really like the characters (except, I wanted to smack Scott a few times). The story does pick up and improve toward the end. And I thought the ending was good. But, after reading the first three books in this series, I think you could skip this one and not miss much."
1,whatever Tamilee,"This dvd did not want to play the first time I tried to use it. I have another one of Tamilee's dvd's and the quality is terrible on it as well. Not sure what is going on there. Well Tamilee don't take into consideration that we are not all buff babes like she. She don't give beginners a chance. I started this dvd, had it in for about 2 minutes and took it out because I couldn't keep up. I do exercie regularly but this is not for me. Her dvd's too are to time comsuming to get started. Terrible waste of money....."
1,Dreary in a boring way.,"I don't mind slow noodling style music, I'm a major early 70s era Floyd fan. But this is one of those more current sounds which would be a perfect match for a pseudo-intellectual French movie about young (or old) people who think they're saying something profound.The tempo never changes and each and every track starts and ends with that same jingle-jangle till it makes the homicidal urges creep up in you, no matter how docile you are. Song writing skill is minimal. The singer sounds like Chris Martin's challenged kid brother and hearing him sing 'your favourite watered down thoughts' made me want to learn a voodoo spell I could cast on him. Holy crap, I like aspects of the hippy era and the music but it sure has produced a lasting negative effect on all 'modern' generations. Put aside your latte, this album, and find something else to do."
5,Wonderfully done,"The Earthquake Exodus is the second book I have read by author Richard Schwartz and it does not disappoint. The stories and the first hand accounts bring this tragedy to life and make the book hard to put down. The photos are amazing, not only do they draw you into the story, but the overwhelming majority of them I have never seen before. I was very pleased with my purchase, and would absolutely recommend this book to a friend."
2,"Good example of bad ""young adult"" literature","Ed Iverson's review (see below) is right on target. This is just another in a long, long line of ""young adult"" novels in which the message boils down to: When you find the ""right"" guy, have sex with him. It doesn't really matter that, in this case, the ""guy"" is from another planet.And from a science-fiction standpoint it leaves very much to be desired. It's strongly implied that Branko, a human-like alien, comes from a planet in our solar system. That's an idea that's outdated by at least a half century, if not much more than that."
4,Dancing with an Alien!! huh?,"Have you ever danced with an alien? Well,I know I havn't. Well,in this book a girl named Tonia doesn't neccessarily dance with an alien..... There's a boy named Branko who comes down to earth to find a female,and bring her back because in their planet all the women died of a serious disease. So, Tonia and Branko meet and become close. And so then Branko explains to Tonia why he was there and Tonia decides to go back with Branko. But Branko figures that she wouldn't really enjoy her life.....so if you want to know what happens next then you should read Dancing with an Alien. I gave it 4 stars it was a good book!"
2,Empty story with a questionable message,"Boy meets girl. Girl experiences 'first love'. Boy realizes that he loves Girl too much to accomplish his 'mission' and returns in disgrace to his home planet. Despite the authors occasional attempts to create authenticity, the alien 'boy' knows way too much about Minneapolis to be credible. The tale would have been innocuous and merely vapid but for the ending, where the author deems it necessary for the girl to give herself to the alien. The message seems to be that its OK for teenagers to 'slow dance' if the circumstances warrant. Just what we need...YA authors encouraging kids to be sexually active...'but only if you're sure that its ""right"" for you'!"
5,"For everyone, regardless of age, who likes Love, or Space, or Both","Entertaining, tender tale, reminiscent of the 80s movie STARMAN, marrying sci fi space fantasy with young love. Kind of wish the ending was a bit different. This beautiful story also reminds me of another sci-fi love book, SUMMER OF THE GREEN STAR, from '81, which I also enjoyed, but the mood of this story is darker. Again, five (green?) stars"
2,Pricey,Not very easy to use for bar coding. I could not find any programs on the avery website that supported it for barcoding.
5,EXCELENT!,"I buy this labels to print barcodes of products to my company, It's perfect size for these!. The material is very adaptable to others uses. I recommend it!"
5,Too thin,The mushroom chips are too thin but the taste is unbelievable great. Buy the higher grade if you want to feel the mushroom in the mouth. There is a 20% off coupon for next purchase in the package.
3,Tastes great and a LOT of worms...,"I have never cooked with porcini before and bought 16oz of these. They smell so amazing and the flavor is just wonderful! I made a soup of barley, italian sausage, and mushrooms.Though I must warn you... I only soaked about 1/3 of a cup of dried mushrooms and got a dime sized pile of re-hydrated worms. These things are infested! After an internet search I found that this is apparently a normal occurrence. I can't image the amount of worms I got was supposed to be normal though.The mushrooms were limp and looked very unappetizing on my spoon (could have been the cooking time, could have been the fact I could see the little worm paths in the mushroom), but that was some of the best tasting broth I have ever had. I think what I will do is just hydrate them and use only the strained liquid.I never thought I would give an ounce of respect to a food filled with worms."
1,worms,i was happy about the amount of mushrooms and the price but as soon as i put them in hot water i saw a lot of worms.
4,Very nice - excellent quality for price,"I'm extremely happy with these dried mushrooms. The only reason I give them four stars instead of five is that they are exactly as advertised (and I can't give them 4 1/2 stars); not the best grade available but close enough for frequent uses. After soaking, the broth needs to be strained through a coffee filter to remove some grit. Not a huge thing if you expect you will need to do it, but the highest grade dried porcinis do not need it and it does change the quality of the soaking broth, especially when using red wines and/or paper filters. These are an EXCELLENT bargain for the price though. Just remember they need to be cleaned slightly before soaking and remember to strain your soaking liquid before using it in a recipe and you should be all set."
2,No Labeling,"I purchased these mushrooms based on the good reviews. Not sure if I got the stray package, but what I received did not look like food at all. I received unsealed plastic bag with some mushrooms in it. The bag had no labeling indicating contents, weight, country of origin, expiration date and manufacturer name. It is easy to get poisoned by inedible or incorrectly dried mushrooms, so I'd like to get some assurance that my food is safe. This package offers nothing like that. Eat at my own risk? No, thank you!"
5,Elevates food to a whole new level,"I have always been a big fan of mushrooms, but had never cooked with porcini mushrooms before ordering these Grade Extra AB mushrooms from JR Mushrooms.These mushrooms are wonderful! They make everything from oven roasted prime rib to braised chicken to stuffed portobello mushroom caps taste so much better. I served my father what would have otherwise been a boring braised chicken dish, and he said it was one of the best things he ever ate.16 Oz of dried porcini mushrooms is a lot, and after seeing how big the bag is, I feel this purchase was a great deal. I will be ordering another bag soon since I am finding all sorts of ways to incorporate porcini mushrooms into my food. My one complaint is that they did not come in a nice resealable bag. However, this is not enough for me to deduct a star.If you are looking to elevate your food to the next level, try using these mushrooms."
5,Porcini Extra AB grade mushrooms,"Excellent mushrooms and highly recommended. We only made mushroom and barley soup from it and it is always excellent and smells great! But in retrospect (and that's just my own fault) I should have bought ""Super Premium AA"" grade instead of ""Extra AB"" as the pieces were kind of small. Next time I'll buy AA. Because of the size of the pieces, the lower AB grade is not worthwhile sauteing while I'm quite sure AA will be good enough for it. So, don't be too cheap. Still the quality is excellent and the mushrooms are highly recommended."
1,Avoid - mine were worm infested,"I bought these a while ago but did not have a chance to cook them until now. I decided to make porcini mushroom lasagna for Christmas, and, what do you know, had to scrap that idea after trying to rehydrate the porcini. To spare you from the unpleasant details, ""infested"" is quite inadequate to describe the extent of it... What I should have done is rehydrate a few right away and return this garbage back..."
5,Best Dried Porcinis!,"Great big bag of clean, delicious porcinis at a great price! I will definitely be ordering these again in the future!"
5,Informative book,"If you own boas, or want to breed boas, this is an excellent book to have on your shelf. Lots of pictures, lots of tips, lots of information!"
2,beginners level,Most of the information was beginners level and most of the pics were old and had been used in many other of the tfh series of books. While this is an adequate overview of the boas and pythons there are no specifics or scientific info.
3,film,"not easy to use at all, but i tried and failed. i am pretty sure a professional person can use this product."
1,Whoa TOO dark for a truck window,"I bought this with little knowledge of the VLT ratings. I didn't think it would be that bad. I have an older truck and it seems with all the windows that it would get too hot in there. So I bought this wanting to put it in the back window to stop the UV rays and heat. It was way too dark though, I should have bought 25% or 35% and not Limo black, so that was my mistake.I used the rest of it to put on a bedroom window though to block out the sun and I love it for that! I just can't drive with it. So please make sure you get the proper tint or else you are just going to get pulled over or take it off when you can't see behind you!"
3,it was ok...,easy to install but it started coming off after about a month i did everything correct i even used the application kit ill just take my car to a pro for my windows
1,leather,This item is made of leather so be careful its not your average film that you buy in pep boys or advance auto.
5,I wish everybody would read this.,"Being pretty new to law enforcement I found this book and had to read it. I'm confident that it has helped me get in a better frame of mind for the job and was entertaining while accomplishing that.Completely reccomend this to everybody in law enforcement, anybody interested in law enforcement/officer involved shootings, everybody in the media, everybody who has ever looked at one side of an incident and placed judgement, and everybody else."
2,"Good idea, but very poor read","The author acts like he knows all about police work, but he himself has only limited experience as an LEO. His book is just a compilation of other officers' experiences. Which is fine, but the book turns into a ""so-what?"" type of book. It gives no real ideas as to how to make things better for officers who get involved in on-duty shootings. A waste of money."
3,holistic antibiotic,"in todays world of ever increasing use of perscription antibiotic, many bacterial strains are becoming immune because of this use. its nice to know that there are alternatives to perscriptions that work just as well."
1,Buy the artists these turds rip off,"these idiots try to be a mish-mash of all the classic artists of the past i.e. GG Allin, Iggy and the Stooges, Rollins Band, and the list goes on... and fail miserablyI saw them live and they sucked. But the people in the audience sucked more. That's because these drongos try to be 'crazy' on stage rehashing all that's been done before... zzzzzz.. the audience are stupid, they think this has never been done before. That triple J fool who said she threw her pants at them is abomination and has no concept of good music. No stars."
1,Pure unadulterated junk.,Handle pulled off while taking it out of the shipping carton. Hinges and clasp flimsy beyond words. Next time I'll us a shoebox - sturdier and no pretensions about what it really is.
4,The funny way of learning words,"The storys make me lagh so much, but the more meticulous explanation about the vocaburary would make this more wonderful."
1,Uneasy on the Ears,"Imagine hearing the most obnoxious and annoying sound each time a new word is introduced. Gets old fast right? That's exactly what this program does. I can see how this might get people to memorize words and their useage, but for me it was incredibly unlistenable. I bought it to listen to in my car for my commute to and from work, and liked the idea that it introduced new words through storytelling. However, the stories were all corny and I knew what more than half the words meant. To sum it up:Do not by if you do not like the idea of obnoxoius sounds cued at every word,Do not buy if you consider yourself to have moderate vocabulary...This item is very elementary."
2,Maybe Good for Middle School or High School...,"I bought this to study for the GRE and it was not helpful at all. The stories are nothing like I expected, and hard to pay attention to because they are very cheesy.I did give it to my middle school level sister so she can start to build her vocabulary and she seems to be using it just fine."
5,Not as good as the 1st and 3rd albums,This album is okay but it's not as good as Suburban Rebels and Welcome to the Real World. It has a (then) newer version of Drinking and Driving and the album has a metalish sound to it.
1,"Great, what I saw","What I saw of this performance was great, but there is a flaw, I could not navigate the menu or play it on two of my machines, on the third it played to chapter 12 then just stopped! I could not play it further or get passed the glitch. I am waiting for my second replacement from Amazon, I think they got a bad lot of discs from the supplier. I hope the third one will be the charm."
5,Outtakes?,"These are the songs that didn't make it to the official releases. Even Elvis's outtakes are better than most bands best efforts. 'Turning The Town Red' is a radio classic (that has never been played on the radio). 'Black Sails In The Sunset' is a beautiful pop song. 'The Flirting Kind', 'Heathen Town', etc. As a songwriter myself, I could only hope that my work measures up to Elvis's outtakes. Elvis is a master songwriter who has written so many great tunes that he can allow some of them to never see the light of day. I'm going to go through his trash cans and a probably find enough material to launch my own career. Thanks Elvis."
3,General account of Napolean's exploits,"Covers Napolean's campaigns and attempts to describe something of the world in which Napolean, his enemies and his allies operated. Each campaign is covered by a separate chapter with references to other events that were taking place simultaneously.Some overgeneralization of national character of various European peoples.Still...an enlightening treatise of how Napolean shaped the modern identity of Europe and ushered in other changes in the nineteenth century, particularly for Germany, Italy and Spain."
4,Useful if Necessarily Limited Introduction,"Herold took on a very difficult task when he wrote this survey of the Napoleonic age. At 450 pages, it may seem expansive, but each chapter could easily be expanded into a book that long. For example, Herold himself wrote a (very entertaining and now out-of-print) 350-page book on Napolean's Egyptian expedition; in ""The Age of Napolean,"" the same expedition merits only 19 pages. In addition, Napolean's military campaigns are largely glossed over, the intellectual milieu of the time is subject to a very perfunctory review, and so on.However, this is a survey, and therefore only an introduction. And, as far as surveys go, it's a pretty good one. It's well written, briskly paced, and entertainingly opinionated (Herold is no admirer of Napolean) - in other words, it's interesting. It should encourage readers to learn more about the Napoleanic era - in my mind, the mark of a good survey."
4,A Difficult Yet Entising Novel,"If you are looking to get a general idea of Napoleon from his rise to power to his decline this book is on the top of my list. Herold clearly shows his dislike for Napoleon by questioning Napoleons beliefs. Each chapter is seperate from one another telling part of the story of the age of Napoleon. This is by no means an easy read but after understanding the impact Napoleon has made on our lives we realize how important it is to understand what Napoleon was all about. The book allows us to look at Europe from the eyes of Napoleon and understand his methidology. Anybody who critizes this book for Herold's dislike for Napoleon does not understand that in order to write a great book depicting the times of Napoleon, one does not need to worship the subject of the book. It is better to have the opposing points of view in mind when making a decision."
1,Terrible.,"As you read this book, the author's sneer of superiority comes across loud and clear. Too much space and time is spent proving that Napoleon, in the author's opinion, was no genius,and too little space in actually discussing his accomplishments. The author also has decided that philosophy is his forte, and dispenses his judgements freely, much to the detriment of the book and my opinion of the author. This is not a well written book and is not worth reading."
2,More music than affirmations,"I was dissapointed that this cd contained very little in the way of affirmations, making it more of a new age music cd of 15 short tracks. I think that the purpose of this cd would have been better served with the music as a background to affirmations, as opposed to a music cd with an affirmation or two as almost an afterthought."
4,Good enough,I listen to this CD every day. I would prefer different music for the non-talking parts of the CD.
2,cheesy,"Susan Jeffers, Ph.D is a fine writer and her book ""Feel the ""Fear but Do it Anyway"" is really a must have. unfortunately, perhaps due to the time produced, this set of affirmations comes across as incredibly silly because Dr. jeffers is not equally gifted with a soothing voice. it is nasal, with ups and downs of inflection that are more like a narration of a bad children's book. And the music....egad, even if it were well produced it is nauseatingly tinkly and grating.Some pieces of this are ok, and if done by someone with a better voice, with better music, it would not come across sounding to fatuous as it does. It might make a 10 year old feel confident, but not for long...."
4,The Fire Island Pines' Survivors' Soundtrak - Indispensable!,"If you've never read Andrew Holleran's DANCER FROM THE DANCE, or taken the ferry from Sayville NY to revel in the bacchanalia at Fire Island' Pines or Cherry Grove, buy this CD anyway. To quote Holleran, ""The next song turned their bones to jelly and left them on the dance floor with heads back, eyes nearly closed, in the ecstasy of saints..."" Don't miss this sublime collection designed for any disciple of pleasure."
2,Is pink the new black???,"I purchased this guitar as a gift for my sister, I chose black because i thought it would look polished and its a basic color anyone would like. Well, the guitar arrived today, and when I opened the box, I was looking at a HOT PINK guitar with black accent around the edge. The box learly says color: black. I'm just a little annoyed, and pretty confused...Is pink the new black??? Not only that, but the black accent paint is smudged in spots. Not sure yet how it sounds, but it better sound pheonominal."
1,Never Again,I recieved my guitar today. The sides of the fretboard are chipped and cracked and scratched. The tuning keys were loose. The pitch pipe is tuned flat. The 6th string was wrapped incorrectly. I should have saved my shipping added a bit more money and bought something that was in good shape to begin with. Never Again will I deal with this company.
2,"Really, REALLY?!","I read this for my Bible Study group for young adults. There were a few good chapters about the grey area of life and finding those who you are following, are at a steady pace with, and those who are following YOU. The book was terribly written and amateurish. His list of what he wanted in a future wife? I laughed SO HARD. I couldn't believe you all fell for his watered down babbling. Especially the start of the book with the letter of the daughter to her mother. I had read that about five times elsewhere. A bland start. A disappointing finish."
4,If you make AG Water aThis is a Must,We make silver water for all kinds of reasons and had been using very fine silver wire. A friend suggested that we try Atlasnova and this wire in particular - it is great. Heavy and pure - it it is great for using in this manner.
5,Mike's second best album/cd,"Hey I found it too! I hope Mike gets a chance to read these reviews. It's been along time since I have seen him. Last time was '79 the Old Man's Bouquet always brings a tear to my eyes. Thanks for all the good times Mike. My son and his whole platoon love this cd. Thank god he doesn't take after me, so the song ""Bill Is In His Grave"" wouldnt apply to him. I pray for all the troops to return safely."
4,Chickenpox,This was a very good easy listening ska cd. Very smooth and tight lyrics. I really enjoys listening to it.
2,Looks and feels like lotion not cream,I used to buy this cream all the time many years ago and since I couldn't find it anymore I figured it had been discontinued so I was REALLY happy when I saw my favorite cream available again. The box was sealed with plastic wrap and it definetly appeared new. When I opened the box the name (Sung - Alfred Sung) is faded. I couldn't figure out why the letters would be faded off. The bottom of the jar has some minor scrapes too. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and figured maybe its a really old product and maybe it was upside down and maybe the letters came off with the box itself while transporting it or keeping it in storage....nah!!! I decided to keep the cream anyway just to avoid any kind of conflict. It is definetly the Sung fragrance I just strongly believe its body lotion and not the thick-creamy original body cream.
5,LOVE IT!!,I have had this product before and loved it. Finally found it again. I wear Alfred Sung cologne and this cream layers beautifully. BEST body cream I have ever used!!
3,Widescreen Print ?,"This is a widescreen, but not anamorphic widescreen. It is letterboxed, so to fill the screen of an HD TV you will need to zoom. The print is average quality, not up to current DVD standards for anamorphic prints, but you do get a widescreen version of this epic movie.The menus are Portuguese, and subtitles can be turned off. If you order be careful to ask the seller if you are getting the Portuguese version, if that is what you want. There is another version, a Korean version, which I have not seen."
3,Sex and the cities.,"An early 60's Italian Bible epic, with decent acting and a fairly literate script, although it varies considerably from the biblical account. Rather than taking on the subject of homosexuality in Sodom and Gomorrah (probably unthinkable even in 1960's Italy), the film instead depicts the twin cities as centers of ""evil in general"", with everything from gambling to incest to death cults. There is some implied lesbianism on the part of the Queen of Sodom, but no reference at all to the men of the city wanting to ""know"" Lot's angelic visitors. Effects are good for the time period, and Stewart Grainger pours some genuine humility and human weakness into his Lot character. Not bad as Bible epics go."
1,Very Poor,"I am not pleased with this movie at all. It barely relates to the story told in the Bible. The movie shows Lot pleading with the angel to spare Sodom and Gomorra. According to the Bible, Abraham pleaded with the angel. Lot daughter is in love with the queen's brother. Lot is remarried to this woman. There are no such occurences in the Bible. I wish people would learn the stories of the Bible before writing a movie script. I was so happy to purchase this DVD, now I wish I never did. This is such a waste of money.Sodom and Gomorrah [Import]"
4,Interesting,"I read books really fast but this one was an exception, I don't know why, maybe because of the way it's written, but I read it very slowly. This is a very good book about an amazing, talented woman who has died too soon, I recommend it."
5,I only use K&N,"I just replaced my OEM volvo air filter with this one. It sits higher than the OEM, but the rubber is softer, and with the included grease, I feel that it has a better seal around the filter. Had to fight to get the back tabs back into place and get the front latched down, but I am confident that this is a superior filter with better airflow than the OEM."
3,"Do not see, hear, or feel much of a diference","I have a 2001 Volvo XC with turbo. I thought the addition of this filter would be a noticable positive change because of the turbo. BUT, cannot feel or hear any diference. I do not see any gas savings either. I'm sure it has to be doing something since these filters do breath a lot easier than stock, I just think that its not going to be all you were expecting on this type of vehicle. Wish I could giove a better review, but bottom line, in my experience, performance is about the same as stock. Maybe I will save in the long run since I will not have to change filters as often? Good luck!"
3,Quicker engine response,"Air filters are something you have to change It improves gas mileage and your engines response time. I chose going the extra mile and getting a K&N; air filter. This is not something you will actually feel more horsepower from it just allows your engine to breathe more freely. Thus giving it quicker response.Now when I have to give it a little extra gas I hear my turbo wind just a little louder. heheThe possible downside I'm worried about is ""if"" this filter allows for some of the smaller particles to get through It could possibly damage my turbo/engine. The turbine fins are fragile so this possibility is a worry to me."
3,Good...But Not His Best,Eric Stone is a great artist. I love his past albums. I must say i was a little dissapointed with this release. Not that is bad but the prduction is a bit off and it doesnt have the feel of a live album- nor is it of the quality of his previous recordings. He uses a drum machine and other computerised instruments on this album which is very noticeable. The songs are good but it could have been a lot better. Do check out his previous albums first -they are outstanding. I am looking forward to his next teleases.
3,"Bright Colors, Good Quality... But Some Arrived Broken","Bright Colors, Good Quality... But Some Arrived Broken. I used them anyway, and thy looked great on a black chalkboard, but they need to do a better job with packaging so that they arrive intact."
1,broken sticks,"There are 6 colors, 2 of each color. The box of sticks didn't come wrapped in bubble wrap or anything. It was just thrown in with the other items so that only 5 sticks made it intact; 7 broke in 2 or 3 pieces (though 6 of these at least 1/2 of stick left). I don't think its worth buying chalk from Amazon again even if the chalk is colorful and bright."
1,poor quality,poor quality or poor packaging. Every piece was broken on arrival. I never had the opportunity to try the actual product.
1,Awful,Does not show up on board. Hard to use. Short sticks break easily. Does not show up on board at all.
1,Chalk was all broken into small pieces,"Chalk was all broken into small pieces, they should try packing this with some sort of padding. They want at least 20 words, so I say again the chalk was all broken into small pieces."
2,broken upon arrival,I was really disappointed to find that my chalk was broken upon arrival. And when I say broken..... some pieces are too small to even use and had to be thrown out.
5,chalk is chalk?,"Are all chalks created equal? The answer is 'NO'...crayola leaves residue on chalkboards that is impossible to get off...meaning, if you have a board at home and use crayola, you're making a big mistake. This brand and Quartet are far and away better and will not destroy your board..."
2,Breaks Easily,"When I received the chalk and opened it, I noticed that a lot of the sticks were broken. Some of them in 3 pieces or more. I thought that it might have simply been because of the handling by the shipping company. However, when I began to use the chalk, it continued to break up in my hands, even though I was lightly writing with it. I should have listened to the reviews that stated how fragile it was. I won't be purchasing this again."
5,Colorful,"These do break easily, but it really doesn't bother me at all. My kids just end up sharing all the broken pieces anyway.They erase very well, too. They are not one of those cheap type of chalks.I do recommend this product even though the pieces break easily.The kids love these. They are 4 and 3."
5,Great chalk!,Worked on a brand new chalkboard fresh out of the box. Highly rec! Color variety is nice as well. Will reorder.
4,Chalk is Chalk,"This is simply your average run-of-the-mill chalk. It works fine on regular chalkboards. Erases with a little bit of water and a rag. Only one piece was broken during shipping...but then again it's chalk, so why does that mattter?"
2,Weak Chalk,"I bought this for a craft project that I was working on but when I opened up the shipping box, almost half of the sticks of chalk were broken. I am not going to be buying this again.The only good thing that the chalk had going for it is that it does write sharply and the colors stand out well.I would not recommend this chalk. It is not durable and falls apart too easily to be of use."
5,great buy,This is a very nice hard hat. It is well constructed and adjusts to fit your head very well. Would buy again.
3,Not what was expected,"This is a great idea but the execution on this item leaves something to be desired. The unit is wide and can take up too much space in a small laundry area. Assembly is difficult due to lack of good design...the flappers sit in small slots and easily fall out. A good strong draft from either in or out can dislodge the flappers, removing any benefit of keeping air out, the dryer has to be moved out again to reassemble. It does keep the air from coming in...but it is hard to get it to that point. Save your money and don't buy this one!"
1,Where do they get off?,"I've associated myself with punk culture since I was 14. I'm 21 now, and as a college student, I find myself growing out of my angst and search of identity. I was interested, then, to see an objective point of view on why someone like me would have been drawn to such a subculture.I searched my school library's limited database for the word ""punk"" and this book came up. I checked it out, and thoroughly enjoyed the forward. It offers an earnest plea for a fair observation of my generation.350 pages later, I feel none-too-enlightened. I read the whole thing, cursing as I went. No one understands youth but the youth themselves. Don't waste your time with this book."
2,Not great as a diaper bag,"I've gone through a lot of diaper bags and while this one is super cute and has a wipeable material, I didn't find it very functional as a diaper bag. I didn't care for the closure- there really should be a zipper or magnetic closure to ensure that things don't fall out. The size is HUGE which can be good but there are no usable pockets for a sippy cup- there are just a couple small pockets inside. The bag cannot be easily hung on a stroller and because of its size, even if hung on a swivel hook it doesn't work out well with a small lightweight umbrella stroller. This bag is fine for swimming class or maybe a pool/beach bag but I didn't keep mine for very long."
4,"Amanda, after Caroline","_Amanda_ was the second book I read by Kay Hooper. I had high expectations after reading _After Caroline_, and I wasn't disappointed. Until the last few chapters, I was never certain whether Amanda was indeed who she claimed to be or not. Ms. Hooper kept me guessing until the very end. I knew the book held a shocking secret, but nothing could have prepared me for the book's climax. _Amanda_ is a must read. Prepare for late nights."
3,Not Bad,"Definitely not one of those books you can't put down, but not bad. Moved a little slow, although Ms Hooper did incorporate some unpredicatable events which made it nice. This really wasn't my type of romance novel though as I enjoy the paranormal and time travels more. I had read Ms Hooper's Stealing Shadows and had hoped this one would be as good and was disappointed through the comparison."
2,Slow and disappointing,"I was really looking forward to another one of Kay Hooper's books, but I was truly disappointed in this one. The characters are not well developed and there was no ""connection"" created from the author to the reader. The resolution was interesting, but a painstaking read to finally get there. It was just too wordy and the mystery was vague."
4,A very enjoyable read!,"This is the first Kay Hooper I have read. I really enjoyed it, and thought it was very well written. The ending was a surprise, which is very unusual. The book held my interest and the main character was likable. All in all, a pleasant diversion."
3,Who is Amanda?,"Amanda Grant comes to North Carolina claiming to be the long lost granddaughter of Jesse Daulton. Nobody really believes her except for Jesse Daulton. Soon Amanda's life is in danger. Amanda can't remember what caused her mother and herself to leave when she was an 8 year old child but when returning to her grandfather's home, Glory, fragments of her past begin to return to her.By the end of the story, the reader learns the truth to Amanda's past and why she has been missing from the Daulton family's life for 20 years. The story is interesing but at times somewhat overwrought. For fans of Kay Hooper this is probably a good read. There is something here for everyone, romance, suspense and mystery."
5,Kay Hooper Delivers !,"I have been a fan of Kay Hopper for awhile with my favorites being the Bishop trilogys. I was a bit skeptical that this book wouldn't have that paranormal aspect which I love so much in the Bishop/SCU books, well I was surprised to find that Amanda was a really good book filled with suspense, murder, secrets, love and betrayal. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to start the next book of this era of Kays, After Caroline. Pick up Amanda and you won't be disappointed."
5,Brilliant eye opener,"This book is simply brilliant. It shatters the myths and propaganda that have done so much damage to this country over the past decades.Other reviewers have labeled Dr. Sowell as a conservative, but don't think that he is that easy to categorize. The facts he presents are critical of many liberal policies, but his criticisms go beyond simple liberal/conservative politics.If you have an open mind and care about what is going on with social policies in this country, this book is for you."
3,"Good subject, but really dry style.","This would probably be a great school textbook. By which I mean that it is informative, well documented, and fairly short.However, the style is awfully dry. I'm sure a political science major would have no problem reading this book, but I need a little more.If you are not into hardcore political/sociological science, I would recommend ""The burden of bad ideas"", by Heather Mac Donald, which treats about roughly the same subject, and is much more accessible."
5,Strongest recent argument against liberal orthodoxy,"I read this astonishingly well-argued book back in early '96 when it first hit the shelves. Since then, I have reread it cover-to-cover at least twice! Sowell's writing is so rich in common sense and mounts so much evidence that it delivers a well-placed and sorely-needed jolt to both the progrssive status quo and its champions. I believe that the plethora of Amazon reviews speak for themselves in proving that this is a must-read for every American adult. Even those who disagree must emerge with admiration for the scope and quality of Sowell's project. Professor Sowell, God bless you for your courage and your principles."
3,A Very Funny Book!,"Sowell is the only person I know who could say that Ronald Reagan has ""a tragic view of life"" and keep a straight face. Believe me, this book is hysterical. Don't miss it. Of course it's biased and unbalanced, but so is Dave Barry. (I have to admit that Barry is a lot funnier than Sowell, but Barry doesn't pretend to be a serious social critic.)"
1,How to Appease the American Right,This book seems to be an attempt to smear anybody who has any sort of feeling for their fellows. I would call it hysterical nonsense if it wasn't for the fact that so many people seem to think that his sneering attitude towards the less fortunate in society is a viable political commentary. All his comments are valid for the wealthy far right in American society but have no legitimacy for anyone else.
5,Even handed and a great read,"This book is characterized by many as an 'attack on the left', but I see it more as an attack on the general state of the government. Both the traditional left and right are guilty of thinking they have ""the grand answer"" to the most important problems instead of letting the common man (the benighted) decide.The fact the left is more noticable in these actions is just plain and simple fact.It's a great read, with great figures and even better footnoting. I use it all the time during political discussion."
5,"no-nonsense, no-prisoners expose of liberal newthink","I can add nothing to what the other positive reviewers of this book have said. Read this book. Learn it. Quote it like you do the Bible. The truth will set you free. This book will give you a lengthy outline, crammed with specific examples, of what we're up against in dealing with the Dudley Do-Goods that have already come perilously close to ruining this nation. Liberals are trapped in their mindset because they DON'T THINK: they ""feel,"" and they use buzzwords to bypass thought, argument, and evidence. Thank God the elections of Clinton have spelled the doom of liberalism in America. See you at the polls in November: let's get veto-proof majorities in both houses and run these creeps out of town on a rail! (Hint: To get a shorthand recap of the content of this book-- say, if you're hanging around the bookstore on your lunch hour-- read the last chapter, which sums it all up.)"
5,How did we not know?,"Sowell gives us historical references to support his positions. Gee, remember when arguments were presented like that? The quality of his writing makes one long for the days when a US education included lessons on how to think, analyze and process information."
5,It is about time.,Spectacular book that reveals the sham argumentation that passes as critical thought. Dr. Sowell does a splendid job of dissecting the vague terminology and psuedo-intellectual discourse that clouds minds and even ruins lives. It is only a shame that one cannot argue and think like Sowell outlines without getting himself blackballed from the public arena. A person would do well to give a copy of this book to anyone about to enter college or congress
5,eye opening for any reader.,"The reader that will find this book interesting is one which is interested in American politics today. Sowell does a great job convincing the reader to question the evidence as well as the arguments presented by those attempting to sway the opinion of the American public.It does not matter which side of the political arena you choose to inhabit. Liberals, Moderates, and Conservatives are encouraged to read this book."
5,Great?,I'll keep this short and sweet - 1 star reviews are typically very informative and a very good way to decide a book's merits - especially so for this one!
3,FANTASTIC BOOK,Absolutely beautifully done book- David Rockwell and his design team are extremely talented and the mosaic artwork byMixed-Up Mosaics for the Mohegan Sun Casino is just gorgeous.
5,A wonderfully illustrated and easy to understand book,I bought this book for my son's 5th birthday. He has asked me to read it nearly every night since. This exciting story is written in plain language yet the message is not watered down. The illustrations are so colorful and exciting for my son that he wants to look at the book by a small reading light before going to sleep.I highly recommend this book for children of any age.
3,Inspirational,"My kids loved this inspirational picture books about America's past. And while this is intended for young audiences, I must admit that in reading it to them I felt that I learned a few things I didn't know before about our first President."
5,A Great Story,"The liberal crowd just can not stand to hear anything positive about this country.Of course it's a holiday story, it happened during Christmas. It should remind people that they only have the right to criticize this country because of what brave men suffered on their behalf.Teaching the history of this country is certainly not a glorification of war.The 10 Commandments evolved to Thou shall not kill only recently from Thou shall not commit murder, which evolved from the oldest translations of Thou shall not kill except in time of war.It would not matter who wrote this book, how well it was written, or how exciting it was, there is a small, brain-dead segment within America which can not stand the thought of someone actually believing in or being proud of this country."
1,VERY condensed version.,"Huge pictures, fourteen half-pages of story leaves a young reader with a very vague picture of American history."
4,"Great story, great writing, a bit too much xxx","Max is a courageous author who can't be shut down. I know him from 'The Deity' and he has not only done it again, but his writing has improved dramatically. Fluid storyline with good increase of pace towards the end that kept me hanging on. Hardly any narrative or explanations that made his first book more difficult to read.I still like his mix of history, politics and religion. This is what we need to seriously think about. Great!For my taste there is a bit too much xxx-stuff, but then it goes with the flow of the story.Good job Max, look forward to the third part of the trilogy. If the third book improves again as much - Stephen King beware!"
2,Oatmeal,I paid a whole lot of money for a lot of oatmeal. Not exactly what I expected. Threw the stuff in my compost pile and cancelled my subscription. I can't imagine that oat meal is healthy for my dog.I ended up going to the pet store so I could actually have someone tell me what exactly it was that I was buying.
2,This DVD is only 9 minutes long,"This video is only 9 minutes long, and that should have been clearly stated. The video is informative, but far too brief for the price."
1,Do not Buy,This DVD is way to short. The creators of this DVD were out to make a buck and give the customer nothing in return.
4,"Something for everyone...well, almost everyone.","Sorting through the myriads of Pride98 cds can be quite a chore. But once again, Centaur comes through - giving dance music enthusiasts just what they want. Two discs comprise this album - the first being ""pride classics"" which weren't too much to my taste. But the second cd contains quite a few circuit classics (like ""Lift Me Up"" by Red5). Overall - worth the money."
1,Not worth the price.,"Looks okay when your done, but not worth the effort to achive the look. Do NOT soak for 1 minute as stated, the glue will come of and your left with paper... Because of the edges you have to hold each piece forever until it sticks."
4,really cute,"these butterflies look like they are painted onto my daughters walls...i totally love them, had a problem with a few of them not wanting to stick no matter what i did. but none the less a great buy."
1,Not impressed,"These cards aren't that great. I would have done better picking up the $2 box from Walmart. Among the problems:1. Sums on both sides of the cards: one side will say 11-5 for example, while the other says 17-3. The answer to the 11-5 problem is printed in the upper left hand corner of the 17-3 side, while the 17-3 answer is printed on the 11-5 side. My poor 7-year-old is so confused. I would much rather have 11-5 on one side, and 11-5=6 on the opposite side.2. Yellow text instead of black3. Overinflated price. The suggested retail price on the back of the box says $1.98 or something like that. Why is Amazon charging $5?"
2,Wrong title,"The intriguing title of the book raises hopes that one will have the opportunity to learn about how whites have historically taken advantage of blacks by using their unpaid labor and appropriating their various extraordinarily artistic and cultural accomplishments, while at the same time lacking sympathy to their plight of poverty and racism. The essays in this book, however, largely fail to address this issue. One essay in particular stands out: a white author long describes at length the bullying he suffered at the hands of blacks in his youth, then in the last paragraph mentions how his brother is a rapper.... please."
4,Everything But the Burden,"Everything But the Burden: What White People Are Taking from Black CultureThis collection of essays and short commentaries is well-written and hits the mark not just for African Americans, but for those people who keep current - or want to keep current - with the origins of all those hip, cool sayings. It will be surprising to find that among some of us, this phenomenon is far from new."
3,Nice look,Nice look but not the type of feel I want to sleep on (edges my teeth). Delivery met the standards.
2,NOT FOR AMERICANS,"Although well done, a bunch of UK school kids running around acting ""gangsta"" (American hip hop style)with thick british accents is hard not to chuckle at."
3,Pleasant Corporate Trip Hop,"Probably more of 2.5 Stars but no 1/2's here at Amazon. This disc is a little trip hop trance but it's not very interesting as stand alone tracks - if you're doing a corporate event at a bar and you want some music that sounds vaguely hip to average people but yet not too ""real"" trip hop that might get people to dance or to be distracted, this is a fine CD. For background listening, it's pleasant - for dancing, it's just bland."
1,It was Okay!,"I had expected more romantic songs like ""Night & Day"". That's my favorite song on this CD. I probably won't listen to it very often. :("
5,"Temptin'?.....No, SMOKIN'!!","Sounds as fresh today as it did when the original was released back in 1995. Having their version of Night and Day included in the What Women Want movie was a good move, and should have helped them reach a wider audience. As a body of work, this must be amongst the best ever to come out of Motown, by any of their artists, and that should speak volumes. The arrangements and singing on these timeless standards will make your musical moments special, whatever your setting happens to be, cruising, chilling at home, getting your teeth pulled, (LOL)whatever. Don't be fooled as you look at the songs on offer because even if you've heard some of them, you haven't heard them like this."
4,Nobody Can Touch The Tempts,"This cd is awesome and its amazing that the Tempts are still going and going strong. Can't help but to think what could have been had Paul, David, Eddie and Melvin lived. But I don't want that to take away from the guys that are in the Tempts now. This cd is so smooth and romantic that you can't help but to fall in love with this cd. Plus, the guys look great. If you are a serious R&B fan, then this cd is a must!!"
5,Incredible does not go far enough.,"I have just finished reviewing the Temptations new album, ""Reflections"". Listening to this CD again makes me realise how disappointing the new CD is. This album is incredible it grabs you from the first note. All the songs are given an update that not only keeps faith with the originals, but brings them home to a new audience. Please get this CD now, before it is to late."
5,Consummate interpretations of some great classics!!!,"Beautiful! Sensational!! Outstanding!!! The Tempts' interpretations of these classic songs are better than the originals combining the classic Temptation harmony with very smooth and lilting arrangements. This is also the first album recorded without the great Melvin Franklin. The tribute to Melvin, along with his haunting intro, just gets to your heart (I can just see Melvin doing this intro probably knowing he was going to die soon but urging the group to continue the Temptation legend). Otis Williams' lovingly written tribute to Melvin is very heart-rending. This CD is a ""must-have"" for Temptation fans and other lovers of great music."
5,Aptly Titled!,"This has some very well arraigned songs that are a more modern offering of the legendary Temptations smoothness. ""Night & Day"" and ""Some Enchanted Evening"" are the standout cuts. This will be a timeless album for lovers."
5,Temptations Forever,The Tempts have been and still are the best vocal group ever! This CD is still great today. Take a listen!!
5,Awesome!!,"The Temptations still got it going on! I was very impressed when I first heard this CD. When I asked who was the group, I was told the Temptations; I was very pleasantly surprised. No longer singing in the Motown tradition, the Temptations delivers renditions of classic hits from the past with a contemporary spin. There sound is very mellow, definitely soulful and will put you in the mood for love. I recommend this CD for anyone one wants to create a special evening or reminiscence with their significant other."
5,Toronto Music Scene,"Magic People is a revealing look at the Toronto music scene in the '60's. This album shows a reflective folky band that also knew how to rock but always did so with style and intelligence. I believe they only made three albums, counting their Greatest Hits, which is virtually impossible to find, but well worth the search. (contains more than just songs from the first two albums)"
1,"this book is just plain bad, as in: 'not good'....","i read this book shortly after it came out.odd that no one has reviewed it yet......perhaps those readers are more polite than i, and have taken mom's advice:'if you dont have anything good to say, don't say anything at all'well, sorry mom. i have nothing good to say about this book but i will not remain silent..........this book is just plain terrible. its convoluted and border line incoherent."
1,Poor Service On The Part of Amazon and its Retailers,"I called AMAZON AND this vendor first thing after ordering (AFTER FIRST PHONING AMAZON WHO SAID I HAD TO CONTACT THEM DIRECT), when I discovered I had ordered the wrong part -- no response, but lo and behold I was charged immediately...and did receive the product.Please have your seller contact me and send a pick up tag -- I should not pay for return shipping and do expect a complete refund.VERY, VERY BAD SERVICE ON THE PART OF AMAZON AND THE END SELLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Dry and bland,I found these to be very dry and just taste like dates. I like the Raw Revolution bars a lot better.
3,"""Pecan Pie"" starring ""Dates and Orange"" (feat. cameo by ""Pecan"")","These tasty bars are more date than anything else. They're quite tasty (if you like dates), and the inclusion of orange makes them quite refreshing.They are moist and chewy with the pecans offering a nice blend of textures.I recently tried the ""On-the-trail Mix"" flavor of this product and I liked it even more than the Pecan Pie variety."
3,Just like it looks,Very nice album not anything super special. Very nice for a album nothing else to say really. Sucks the fabric will get dirty and can't be cleaned very easily.
2,Seahawks,Loved the jacket. But the first time I used it the zipper broke. Second rate parts used in the making.
1,Ordered wrong thing,When this was ordered my mom thought it was a book to actually read.......it was actually for an MP3. When I put in my search engine to look up BOOKS this is what came up.
5,Very different,I think you'll like this alot. It is a very different JD Robb. Terrific story and fascinating characters. Eve experiences a world she never believed existed. Lots of fun.
3,A good game,"Toy Story was one of my favorite games for the Sega Genesis. It had some of the best graphics I had ever seen at the time, way better than a lot of other Genesis titles. The sound captures the whimsical fun of the movie, and each song fits the current scene perfectly. The game play is good, but it gets a little too tough and frusturating as you get further into the game, escpecially for a children's game. Don't get me wrong, it is still fun. If you liked the movie, you should play this game!"
1,Disney toy story,I didn't like this game. I bought it for my son and he can't even play it because it doesn't work
2,Good very basic phone. BUT goes dead once a week.,"I use it with Virgin Mobile. They use Sprints digital network, so service in only as good a Sprints digital network (minimal digital service in rural areas). At least once a week I have to remove and then reinsert the battery as the phone goes dead."
4,Small phone - good quality,I have been a Virgin Mobile user for about 2 years and this is my third phone and the best so far. This is a very small basic phone. I was a bit apprehensive about the small size but there really does not seem to be any problems due to the size. The screen is a bit difficult to read w/o the backlighting and I think the speakerphone volume is weak. But the ring is loud and the voice quality is good. Reception is very good. The vibrating alert is also on the weak side. The keypad is small but I have no problems with it.
4,Goodish...,"This phone has gret service, and doesn't break easily. (Trust me, I'd know I've dropped it too many times to count!!!) It has long lasting battery power. I've left it on for an entire weekend without neeeding to charge it. It's the perfect size: Not too small that you can't text, but not too big that it sticks out of your pocket.The only downside to it would be that there is no camera or color. So if your not into a phone for style, just service, then this is an awesome phone for you!!! If you want style, but good quality I suggest a different VirginMobile phone. If your just into looks and nothing else then you might want to try a razr."
3,Shorty Phone,"Phone is excellent for what I wanted it for (emergency/occasional use). Can't beat VMobile. Found VMobile service dept. excellent and the plan is inexpensive and predictable. Only problem has been that auto-shutoff bug. I have purchased two phones within the last month, and one has already shut down twice: No calls in/out until reset by battery removal/replacement. Nokia service dept. would not admit to any knowlege of this problem. I only know one other person who has this phone and this bug bit her, too. Must be a common problem. Virgin Mobile good, Nokia bad."
2,For the Price,"i dont hav this phone my brother actually does i have a samsung a850. yet i have used the phone that my brother alot recently. if you are just a normal user and like the simple brick cell phones that have color then this is for you. but if you need a nice phone like i do then stay away. of all of the phones with menus that i have seen is the motorola menus, the samsung menus, the lg menus, and the new verizon menus. the nokias falls in the second to last place with the lg menu in last and the new verizon menus just in front of that.Pros:durablecolorsimplesorta easy to navigatedecent lookingcalls like any normal phonegood sound qualityConsbad reception(vergins fault)not clear colorvery confusing menu if you are used to a nice flip phoneno mobile webonly two direction keysbad color disignvery uglyall the buttons are together so it is hard to feel and textconfusing while textingbuilt in games suckI wanted to give it a 1.75 but i just rounded it up"
4,VVery Well Made.,"This item was very well made by the Virgin Mobile Company. It's Features are amazing, and the sound quality is very good. The screen is very visible and good. Although is is somewhat small, it is still compact and fits almost anywhere. I really enjoy this item. It's one of my favorite Virgin Mobile Phones so far."
4,Very good phone,"I only had this phone for 3 weeks, but those 3 weeks were very good with this phone.Its so small and portable, but I was offered the Snapper, which I did switch to. I like the flashlight, its useful and a unique idea. The phone gets a good signal in most places, and only had 1-2 dropped calls. This phone is very reliable and easy to use."
4,Very Good Product!,"I have had only one cell-phone model in the past, so I may not be the perfect judge. My previous cell was the Mobile Timeport p8767, with Verizon service. I had all the extras: mutiple antennaes, cases, indoor and auto chargers, PC link and software, link to palmtop computer, extra batteries etc.The Nokia Shorty 2115i is really great. Cost $25 and FREE FEDEX shipping and $25 of call credit was provided. One only needs to TOP UP every 90 days, so it is esentially $7 a month with tax. This $7 can apply to the $0.18 minutes.The features are convenient and intuitive once you run through them a few times. The RADIATION is about 1/2 of what the TimePort produced from a Govt website."
3,An adequate performance,"As reported by others, this phone does turn itself off spontaneously even when the battery is well charged, necessitating removal and replacement of the battery before it can be turned back on. This has happened four times in the last two months, but otherwise the phone has performed well. It's small, light, and reasonably easy to use.My only other complaint (minor) is that the phone doesn't come with a ""generic ring"" ringtone. It has a selection of techno-hip ringtones (with names like EvilPizz and KrunkTone) that I fear are entirely too hip for me, but I can't bring myself to pay extra for a normal ring."
4,Does what you expect,"I don't use the games (which another reviewer lists), and I don't buy ringtones. I do send text messages, which this phone does fairly well (the menus are a bit annoying, but the predictive typing feature works well), and fairly cheaply (ten cents to send, nothing to receive). The flashlight, while weird, comes in handy more often than you might expect. And it works as a phone. Not a lot of frills, but a good, solid, reliable phone.One annoyance for those who talk and drive is that, unlike many phones, this requires a nokia headset, rather than a 2.5mm plug headset. I found it a bit more difficult finding the nokia headset at a reasonable price."
1,Automatic Shut Off....What the!?!?!?!,"I bought this phone through Virgin Mobile. It is small, cute and has great features.After about 3 weeks, it shut itself off. I thought it lost it's charge and tried to charge it but it wouldn't work. I removed the battery and put it back in and it worked again. The battery was still half charged. I leave it on all the time. This day it was only on about 2 1/2 hours before it turned itself off. Not good.Plus the voice mail icon won't go away even without any messages.Nokia told me to send it in for repair. Virgin told me to send it back for a new, same model phone. I'm thinking about trying to get my money back.Such a shame. I really liked it. I may check out AT&T...I; hate them, too!***UPDATE: Nokia sent me a new one. Haven't had any problems in over a year."
3,Faust,"The sound quality was not so good. The price is getting higher & higher. It sounded like it was recorded outside the theatre. From time to time I could barely hear someone was singing from a great distance. I am a big fan of Alfredo Kraus and I believe, as do many others, he is the best singer of the century. However, an important work like this one should have come with an libretto. How could any non-french-speaking audience be able to fully appreciate the music without it? I also did a research on his discographie. There is a better recording: CD C749067 2 EMI 1987 live, conducted by Veltri. Can the company try & release this one?"
5,Doesn't get much better then the Anti-Heroes!,"Anti-Heroes have been my last baston for solid punk music for a few years now. The rest are eather dead or broke up years ago. Since they're a local Atlanta band catching one of their shows on the weekend was a common ritual.My best decription has always been, imagine Sam Kinison fronting a Oi! band. Mark has a voice that could tear through sheet metal. Thats a good thing btw. And i'll side with some of the less ignorant reviews here, they are NOT nazis and they are NOT racists. I've met black fans at their shows and they didn't catch any grief from anyone.That said, American Pie is a must have for anyone that is frustrated with the overabundence of pop-punk that is in the mainstream nowdays. And even those of you that can't live without your pop-punk, step up and check out a solid band that has a message without a pushy agenda."
4,"Honest, fun, and listenable.","I bought this on a whim because it was cheap (used) but I was pleasantly surprised to find this group full of energy and producing a really good CD. Reminds me of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, which is one of my favorite bands."
2,Could not get into it.,"I just could not get into this book. I will probably try again later, when I have run out of other things to read. It starts out slow, and couldn't keep my attention. Also, I didn't realize it was a Christian based book. Not that it matters, but would have been good to know before I bought it."
1,Its too easy,"I think its too easy to look at all the Muslim countries in the world and make wrong assumptions about Islam. I am a Muslims myself and trust me i will be the first criticize the actions of some ""muslims"" in the name of religion. All i can say is dont judge Islam by the so-called muslims of the world but look at the actual teachings of religion by the Holy Quran and Sunnah. There is alot of ignorance in the Muslim world. Its sad because these people dont understand their own faith and in turn giving Islam a bad name. Please study the Quran with an open heart and then u will see how beautiful it really is like i do."
1,Ignorant and naive,This book is sad revelation of an authour who certainly doesnt know anything about islam.The things he mentions about Quaran and Hadith are truly false and most of them are made up by people.I would suggest to the author to get into a class of islam 101 before writing a book.
5,"Eye-opening, riveting, brutally honest","This is a disturbing look at Islam as it truly is, not as Westerners and Christians would like it to be. The book states its case clearly and unabashedly through objective analysis of the Koran, the Sunnah, and the deeds and words of Muslim leaders throughout history. It skillfully and convincingly answers the objections of the apologists who would prefer a naive, head-in-the-sand point of view. It is a must-read for all Americans who want to understand those who have declared jihad against us. I can only hope a copy finds its way to the President's desk."
3,"If you've ever been to Jihad Watch, you'll see this is nothing new","This clinical analysis of Islam--asking and answering about 8 questions that are essential to how we should perceive Islam--is straightforward and loaded with historical evidence (especially Mohamed's rise to power as a Mao-like, religio-political autocrat, and extensive quotes from the Quran and hadith) that it should knock the socks off anyone who's not already familiar with Robert Spencer's work. But I am, and there's not much new here that I haven't already read on Spencer's Jihad Watch website. Oh well.Highly recommended for beginners who want to to dip their toes into the pool of scholarship on Islam. For those who already are familiar with expansive, repressive, totalitarian Islam and are ready for answers about how to defeat it, skip this book."
5,An excellent look inside this insidious religion,"Many people think Islam is a religion of peace because they have heard people on TV say so. Many people believe this because many of us know very nice people who call themselves Muslims but know nothing of what the Koran says(there are ""Jews"" who nothing of the Law and ""Christians"" who know nothing of Jesus, Masons who insist that that the Lodge is not a religion as well) In order to get a clear picture of a religion, one needs to look at the books or writings that religion says is reliable. Spencer has done a wonderful job of this here. Despite the vitriolic protests, the Koran is a book of a very violent and intolerant religion. I wish I knew how many of the negative reviewers have read the book...I suspect very few because their criticisms are so far from the mark. Good job Robert Spencer-good job indeed!"
3,Islam Unveiled,"This is an excellent in depth study of some critical issues in Islam, with which the West must soon come to grips. Unfortunately, Robert Spencer cannot let go of his conservative background, and the contiuned apologias and explanations of why Christianity does not share these challenges detracts significantly from his presentation.Nonetheless, his key questions regarding the inerrancy of the Koran (sp?) and the Sunnah and their implications for Islamic fundamentalism are worth reading, so long as one maintains a healthy skepticism with respect to Robert Spencer's conservative bias.This book should probably be read in conjunction with Lewis' ""What Went Wrong,"" from which Robert Spencer quotes quite frequently."
1,"Uninformed,Unspecialized Opinion.Not surprising from Spencer","As Mr. Spencer admits, Islam is the fastest growing faith in the World,specially in the West and more specially the US. I don't think that all those thousands who are embracing it every second could NOT discover what the author claims he has found out.I wonder how Mr. Spencer qualify himself to come to these conclusions with his superficial information. I wonder what were his soureces of information. Scholars take years upon years to study a staement or an event. I invite all level headed readers to go and find out for themselves."
1,The TRUTH is out there,"The truth is Islam contnues to grow faster than any religion.Even after 9/11 the number of converts in the US alone almostdoubled from 40,000/year to 78,000/yr. Now you go tell theseex-christians, ex-jews and ex whatever that Islam is a violentand barbaric religion and see what they say. Funny how themajority of these converts or should I say reverts are women. Isuggest you get this documentary(http://www.pbs.org/empires/islam/), which can be purchased ofamazon, that was made by non-muslims and see what Islam is andused to be. Also read the Quran (http://web.umr.edu/~msaumr/Quran/).It is obvious that these people that like this book have closedminds and 1 sided opinions and views."
1,This book will create Talibani style intolerance,"This book is written by a person who hates muslim or Islam from the bottom of his heart. A person, who knows true Islam, will sense the total fabrications and falsifications of Islam in this book. In reality this book will create Talibani style intolerance in the west."
3,Superficial Facts,"The Book was great in listing all the symptoms or the reactions of muslims against others, but it failed to decribe the root of the main problems between the Western and Islamic Civilization."
1,Not Fair,"If one wants to find out a religion, go to the source. Don't believe what others spoon feed you. If you have questions, read the koran, or ask an ismlamic scholar. I'm not going to ask my barber to examine my x-ray cause i don't trust my doctor am I? You get a second opinion from a doctor. And if islam is so horrible, why is it outgrowing christianity at a 10:1 ratio, even with all these evil books written bashing it? Answer me that question."
2,Selective criticism,Apply the same critical treatment to the Bible and you would end up with a pretty grim and threatening version of Christianity. This book will appeal to those looking for easy answers and validation of their own biases. There are a wealth of good titles out there that examine the misguided literalism that twists religion into a divisive and destructive force. Those seeking to reject another's religion clearly don't understand their own.
5,A Balanced View of Islam,"I found Spencer's book credible and well-balanced, a much-needed reality check against the political correctness fed us by the administration and media. After 20 years of study, he obviously knows the subject."
1,Garbage!,"This is by far the most uncomfortable headset I have ever worn. The whole thing just dangles off the ear and the earpiece does not stay in the ear at all. Also, the volume is horrible and everybody said I sound like I'm in a windtunnel. Did I mention the earbud broke the first day I had it? Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on this!"
1,NO GOOD,I have had this product for 5 hours and it is going back!!! Stick to wetsuits not electronics Mr. Bodyglove
2,No Scent,"If you hold the unlit candle up to your nose, the candle has a nice scent. However, once the candle is lit, you can't smell a thing. The jar is pretty, with a tight fitting lid. That's what got this the second star."
1,Worthless!,"I purchased these headphones, not from amazon though.Heres how they were.They can not play bass at all! You can barely hear it on hip hop music so dont even think of hearing it on rock.The trebble is quite high but still, the audio quality that these headphones is poor. They make my mp3s sound as if im streaming them from the internet on a free service (Low quality).I was way better off with the manufacturers headphones for my Panasonic cd player. But alas, those broke."
1,avoid these!,"they sound ok but the ear pieces break off the headband VERY EASILY! they are not sturdy by any means, mine broke the first day."
5,"tmj, migraine, and fibromyalgia relief (if only temporary)","I ordered this product after being at the end of my rope in pain. I massaged this into my jaw, temples, neck, and shoulders, and the warmth immediately soothed the muscles, and my jaw unclenched, which brought some migraine relief. Since it was delivered to my office, I ran to my colleagues who also deal with some chronic pain, and they slathered it on, too. Good stuff. Highly recommended."
3,Okay,It's a weird color and smell. Didn't find it to be as fantastic as I had hoped. Not sure how I am going to use the rest of the bottle.
3,Silly and A 'Lil Somethin'=nice songs,"and Taral has a great voice, but all of the other songs do not sound like anything we have not heard before. The two songs I mentioned where the only ones I would listen to, and I would skip over everything else."
5,Love it,"If you like world cinema, you might love this film as much as I did. It has suspense and it is creepy. Don't read too much about the film. The best way is just to watch it without knowing what will happen."
4,A must see,Good acting A nicely done must watch with Sub titles One of the best of 5 Hansel and Gretel movies that rare out now
5,Great Book,This is a wonderful book. The pictures are fantastic. This is exactly what my husband was looking for. It was a great gift. He already has the 3rd volume!
4,"Astonishingly moving, intricate work...","...unlike a lot of musicians, whose attempt at fiction comes off as stilted and short-sighted, Buarque turns out to be a great, tersely effective novelist. This, his third book, is a short-but-dense meditation on the parallels and interplay of love and language. The narrator, a ghost-writer named Jose Costa, first becomes infatuated with a foreign tongue, than a foreign tongue attached to a foreign girl. While his career peaks, he abandons his wife and fat child to surrender to the Hungarian language and his new teacher...this is only the beginning: Buarque packs a lot into 183 pages, and the two plots (the language and the ghost-writing career) intersect masterfully, leading to a miraculously antipodean conclusion that is neither uplifting nor depressing, just ingeniously circular. Bittersweet to beat the band, unnervingly precise, and immensley poignant, BUDAPEST is also granted with a great translation job from the original Portugese into English."
5,Glad I bought it,"This is a great addition to any modeller's bench .It performs great ,has good solid construction ,and fits on top of my tool chest ."
3,Baby Gift,The dresser was nice but the assembly instructions were very difficult and pieces were not labeled or coded. The was a scratch on the door and one piece (an internal frame was broken.
1,Not worth the money,Generally this is well built sturdy piece of furniture. But it scratches so easily! We have had it for 1 1/2 and it is beat up already. I can't imagine what it will be like after a few months of toddlerhood. Save your money for something else.
4,Very nice,Package was all beat up when I got it. A few pieces where broke.. But knowing about wood I fixed it. Could have been packed a bit better
3,"Looks great, but good luck putting it together!","I like to think I'm pretty darn handy, I'm a DIYer and have done many home renovations and built plenty of furniture. This piece was one of the worst I've seen when it came to instructions and quality of parts. It took me approximately 5 hours to put the thing together. There was a section of the instructions that were just plain wrong, and if I didn't have the sense to question it the feet of the dresser would have been installed INSIDE where the drawers go. The pieces alone weren't great quality, two pieces (interior support pieces) arrived broken but I was able to use wood glue and clamps to repair.However, when it was all said and done and everything was put together, it looks great and feels solid. It looks great in the nursery and I think will hold up to the test of time, just be forewarned about the instructions and frustrations of putting it together!"
4,Happy with our purchase,"I read all of the reviews for this product, and decided to purchase it although some of the reviews are concerning. We have used the dresser for almost 2 months, and haven't had any problems with scratching, shifting, or falling apart that some of the other reviewers complained about. I love the finish, and the design is great. There's plenty of space to keep clothes, towels, and all sorts of stuff. I love the small drawer for wipes and creams, and the shelves are great for keeping back-up supplies of diapers and wipes. It did take a long time to put together, and the holes for the feet weren't pre-drilled, so one of our feet isn't quite on straight, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall, we've been really happy with our dresser!"
3,Nice dresser,Nice dresser once we got it put together. Would have been easier to put together if the pieces were labeled to go with the instructions. It looks great in our baby's room and we will be using the longer area as a changing table.
4,Very pleaseed,"This seems to be a good quality dresser, I was a little concerned with all the mixed reviews but decided to take the chance. I do still tihnk it's a bit over priced and the instructions are awful. Once you get the base together just build it yourself and don't try to follow steps because they dont make sense. I feel it's going to last a long time. The drawers do have side rollers instead of just the cheap track that runs down the middle. My only complant, but I'm not picky so it doesn't really bother me is that all 3 drawers seem pretty different in shade, like almost the dark one got and extra coat of finish but again, I know each piece is different and wood just acts differently each time."
1,DaVinci Kalani Dresser,"This is the WORST dresser ever! Especially since it is for a baby's room! Putting it together was a nightmare, parts were missing that we had to have resent. It is a very cheaply manufactured product that should never be sold for a children's room. The drawers fall apart every time you open them because the pieces don't lock together correctly. When trying to get the company to send replacement parts, they refused to respond. After sending a dozen emails and constantly calling, it took them 8 months to finally respond, just to send more cheap materials. And the bottom of the drawer is nothing but a thin piece of board that barely holds clothes. This is not something you want in a child's room where they can really hurt themselves. The dresser looks nice but it is complete crap. It scratches and marks very easily. Go with better quality furniture, your child's life is at risk!"
1,missing pieces,"Really, how many missing, broken and wrong pieces can one company put in a box??? Just plain incompetent! Don't waste your time."
3,Dresser Review,The mounting parts was complete. The dresser color was in good shape. The reason I wasn't completely satisfied with this product was that there was some damages (Scrach or paint removals) on the changing table surface. This board requires to be fixed or changed. I haven't contacted the seller but I would like to get contacted by them to resolve this issue ASAP.
3,Product NOT STURDY for the Price,"The item is not sturdy. This is an expensive baby piece of furniture. It scratches MUCH TOO EASILY!In placing the book case unit over the dresser- it made a dent- and that was with VERY LITTLE movement or pressure. Then the Wood cracked where the screws were inserted- again with very little pressure. The pieces are good to look at- and look attractive. However, the pricing is quite high and not worth the workmanship quality."
2,keeps falling apart,my husband puts a lot of things together he is pretty good at it we have four kids!!but the draws keep falling out were they come together in the frontits not a cheap dresser in price but its cheap in quality
2,A waste of time,"If you wish to spend your time reading a book about running that is virtually worthless to a runner, this is the book for you. The dramatic scenarios are, at best, uninformative and, at worst, absolutely inane. All of this from a writer who has made significant contributions to the literature of running in the past--must've just temporarily run out of anything useful to say. I hope to see a return to the previous level of quality in future endeavors."
3,Good information irritatingly presented,"There's a lot of really good advice on marathon preparation here. Unfortunately, Galloway interweaves the meat of the book with the excruciating story of a fictitious band of infantile, narcissistic runners who are getting ready to run a marathon themselves.This would be a mere annoyance if it didn't make finding the running advice a lot more difficult. The reader is forced to wade through the stupefying adventures of Suzi, Tom etc in order to pick out the many kernels of running wisdom.Stick to the facts, Jeff!"
2,Borrrrrrrrring,"This was definitely one of the most boring books I've everread. I liked the character Gary Service, but that's about it. Therewas a few (very few) good parts, but overall I just coulndn't get intothe book. I agree with the reader from Uniontown PA [about the coverart. The only character that even looked decent was Bishop. Unlessyou're a big Juggernaut fan or just want to be able to say 'I readevery X-Men novel wriiten', I would recomend you pass on buying thisbook. Save your money and rent it from a library if you really want toread it."
5,A great Masterpiece indeed!!,"An interesting piece of novel done by Dean Wesley Smith. Very imaginative and powerfully addictive. In just less than one day i spent a serene afternoon reading this wonderful novel amazed at the beautifully written comic literature. A joy to read, a story to be unforgettable, this book is a best by for me!aka: Proteus"
4,X-Men - The Jewels of Cyttorak,"This book was one of the best books I've read. I liked all the characters and the scenes in the book. Who ever likes superstition or adventure books, this is the one you got to read. This book is about Juggernaunt and the emerald. This emerald gives Juggernaunt strong powers. Since there is another emerald in the same dimension, who ever wears it will make Juggernaunt weak. It is up to the X-Men to stop Steve Service who has the emerald. I liked the characters in the book. Gambit was good at sneaking in the office of the big boss. This book gives lots of suspense. This book also teaches teamwork. If the X-Men did not have team work in this book, they would have been defeated. I would rate this book an 8 between 1 to 10. It has lots of adventure and action. I loved this book and I hope you enjoy or enjoyed this book too."
1,sickening,"Fresh from reading the vastly superior ""Smoke and Mirrors"" book, I expected another (at least decent) ride through the fantastic world of Marvel. Instead, I found a formulated story about (gasp!> another juggernaut. lah-de-dah The new characters were just carbon copy stereotypes. The hermit, the crime-lord, etc. In this book, A true minute of emotion was virtually non-existent. Don't waste your time on this book.P.s. The cover art was atrocious."
1,Another crap song!!,Why dont these losers stop making these wack songs go of to their weird world losers not worth buying at alllllll unless you are brain dead!
2,Too many bugs for the price,"For the price of one of these units, you should expect much better performance. The HR monitor and Cadence sensor have connectivity issues and the HR readings consistently spike to 220 beats per minute during the first 10 minutes of every ride.In addition, the basic software and graphs in the PC based Garmin Training Center (where your data is uploaded) are remedial at best.In summary I would list the following three points that you should consider when reviewing this unit:1. Overpriced2. Functionality flaws3. Grade school software"
4,Awesome Cycling Tool,"The Edge 305 provides a wealth of knowledge, is easy to install, as well as use. I would love to have given it 5 stars (it deserves them), but one thing that does not work correctly, and really bugs me is the calories expended. It couldn't be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way. The first day that I installed it, I took it for a quick 1 mile test ride. IT indicated that in that mile I burned 100+ calories. Wish it were true, but it is not. Unfortunetly the next day I was going to take it out on a 100 mile ride, but crashed as I started out and have not riden since (3 days). I wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further. After 2 hours it read 0 were burned. I just took it for a car ride of 7 miles. In those 7 miles DRIVEN IN A CAR, it indicates I burned nearly 600 calories, again I wish, but no way.Other than that flaw, whioh I hope they fix with a software update, I highly recommend this product, it all other ways it is great."
2,Garmin Edge 305,I like the product and its features. What I don't like is the average MPH is not correct. I have compared the results to other riders and a second bike computer on my bike and it is always off. This makes training difficult and now I have to still carry a bike computer. I have contacted Garmin and their web site does not even acknowledge that the email was sent and there is not email acknowledgement that it was received.
2,Too many bugs for the price.,"The features and price make it seem to be a value on paper. But when you try to use it, the design flaws are readily evident. One of the major ones is with the heart rate monitor. I was getting ridiculous readings on a relatively flat ride. I was getting readings in high zone 4 and 5 all ride. It read my resting heart rate at almost 120. The garmin website says the static electricity from synthetic clothing can cause faulty readings. Since almost all cycling clothing is synthetic, this is a major design flaw. It doesn't sound like they are planning on fixing the problem either. Their brilliant suggestion; buy cotton clothing. Cotton is not a good material for a base layer(for any sport). Instead of purchasing this unit, buy a decent heart rate monitor from another manufacturer, and a basic sigma or cat eye cycling computer. Garmin should stick to GPS."
4,Great tool for training.,This is a great tool for training. I have used it both on and off road and it has worked great every time. I have not had any trouble with the heart rate strap like others have noted. The strap is not as comfortable as the Polar (725) but it still works well. I wish the Edge would show GPS coordinates this would be a big plus (SAR). All and all this is a great computer and has a lot of data to offer.
1,Unreliable,"I loved everything about the 305, except for its proclivity for ceasing to function and short battery life. I went through three of them in a year. The first one went back to the store where I bought it, the second one was returned to Garmin, the final one was exchanged for a Suunto T6 which I have been very happy with (i.e. it works.)Garmin has released several firmware updates that did address the early problems I was having with the unit, but after the third one simply turned off several times on a commute home I gave up. The low (MUCH lower than the advertised) battery life per charge was frustrating as well. I could have lived with that if the unit had been reliable, but as is, I could not recommend this product. Hopefully the new version will work better."
1,A Piece of Junk,"The screen went totally blue after less than 3 months of use. I had to pay to ship it back to get a refurbished item with less than the original warranty and they wouldn't ship the new one until they received the old one. The refurbished one won't have the warranty that the original unit had. I have one other Garmin, which I have discovered by using other devices, is cumbersome to use. I would highly recommend avoiding this product in particular, and Garmin in general."
2,Great tool - when it works!!,"I really like my Edge 305 - I mainly use it to keep an eye on my cadence and heart rate when on the bike and like to keep a track of rides on the computer for cumulative distance, average cadence, etc.But... I am now on my third unit and this has died this evening. On a ride today the altimeter started saying I was at 62,000 feet. At home it wouldn't stay on from startup - it switches off if I press any other button once I switched it on... so I guess it will have to go back to the dealer in the morning."
1,mine broke quickly,"I can only add to what others have said about lack of reliability. My unit worked REASONABLY well for a few months, but then started shutting off randomly. This started happening more and more often until it was every couple of minutes. At that point the unit became essentially useless.It should work better than this in any case, but especially considering the price.Given what others have said about repeated failures with replacement units, and having to pay shipping costs, I am not highly motivated to try to replace the unit.So, money lost."
2,Quality and Service Poor,"I had my Edge 305 for less than a year before it started having problems. The unit just simply powers itself off during high speed descents and rough road patches. I thought this might be due to excessive vibration...so I tried to come up with some different mounts to remedy the problem. The next spring the power issue became overwhelming and I contacted service for repair. To their credit, even though I was about 3 months past warranty, they agreed to cover the repair. I FedEx'd my unit and was told there would be a 10-day turnaround. After 3 weeks I called to find out the status of my RMA...at which point I found out Garmin had LOST my unit. They sent me a refurbished unit. The refurbished unit arrived on a monday. It worked that first day. On Tuesday, the GPS would not acquire any satellites and was worthless. I called Garmin the very next morning and they have agreed to send me a new ""in the box"" unit. However there will be another 10 day lead time."
3,Not for Directional GPS Use,"Unlike other GPS products, such as Garmin eMap GPS, I was abit disappointed to learn that the Garmin Edge 305 GPS does NOT come with features used for displaying a map on the main screen, or have info on Turn by Turn Routing, Turn by Turn Route Prompting, 3D Perspective Map View, Text-to-Speech Voice Prompts, nor does it allow uploading of GPS Maps from a computer or have internal or additional memory. The waypoints are stored in the unit and are downloadable to view the map on a home computer. I was hoping that I could find a GPS unit that would allow me to upload maps of bike routes throughout Southern California and provide directional information. Hopefully the next generation of Garmin Bike GPS products will intergrate these features."
4,Excellent Device/Tool... a little expensive,"I just bought the Edge 305, but have used it on my trainer and walking around my local office buildings. I have had both the 201 and 301 and am VERY impressed with the 305's GPS reception.Fit and finish is excellent and the hardware sync'd quickly.I'll follow up with a long-term assesment."
2,Nice unit but software is poorly designed as are the mounting brackets,The brackets are poorly desinged or designed with the purposeful intention of breaking such that you have to buy new ones. Mine broke and a car ran over my GPS. Nice work Garmin.The software provided by Garmin is also poorly desinged and my unit alway had a hard time connectiong to my computer.
2,Edge 305,"The edge 305 HR has potential. It has all the functions that one would need, HR, Elev., Ability to save courses and routes ran etc..The problem comes with their mapping. The Training center for the computer has a base map that only shows major roads. Thus you need to go thru a 3rd party mapping site to create or mark your course. (or buy another map from garmin at $100+)The battery might last 6 hours - cross your fingers.I turned off my garmin once mid ride to save battery. When I turned it back on the ride totals were all messed up. It did not save.As far as support, so far I have found out how to do things by looking through other forums then going through garmin. Garmin has yet to come up with correct solutions.It has potential. Id just hate to spend $650 on the 605/705 to see if things got better."
5,Garmin Edge 305,This is a great bicycle tool. I mountain bike and this tool lets me see how I am doing during a ride and stores all the info so it can be looked at after the ride.The ride data can be uploaded to the Garmin motionbased web site and from there you can see where you rode on Google Earth very cool.
2,It works but design and/or quality control are lacking,"The first unit I had would turn-off on bumpy roads. I sent it back to Garmin. They sent me a refurbed unit a few days later. The refurbed unit does the same thing. This is very frustrating when you lose your ride data after 30-40 miles and/or are constently having to look down to see if the thing is on or off.This sounds like a poor design or poor quality control. The thing isn't made to withstand the shock it's exposed to when mounted with the factory mount near the handle bar stem.I ended making my own shock absorber by wrapping some small diameter rubber automotive water line (e.g., like what's used for your windshield washer) around the handle bars. 4 or 5 loops around the handle bars is enough to mount the factory bracket over the rubber line loops. This seemed to help quite a bit."
3,Garmin 305,"When it works it's features are fun and interactive. Technically, it is very weak. It has a lot of quirks when exchanging information between the device and computer. When downloading from the device to the computer the device will beep appropriately and give a report confirming data transfer. However, the computer side will report that it cannot communicate with the device. After several blind repeats the computer side will generally ""spontaneously"" eventually accept the data. The bad news is that repeating the transfer process risks ""frying"" the device and making it inoperable. Very frustrating."
1,"good concept, dangerous product","The Edge 305 is a product that was apparently rushed to market before it was fully tested. As a design engineer I've seen people fired for doing this kind of sloppy work. This device has an inherent flaw: it has a tendency to spontaneously shut down in the middle of a ride. This defect is dangerous because it distracts the rider. You don't want to be constantly babysitting the computer when you should be watching the road and the traffic and concentrating on your performance. The device is not supposed to be a hassle, it is supposed to be a tool. I have several riding companions who have this model and every one of my friends' devices has the same problem. Garmin should face up to the problem and do what any responsible company would do, that is replace the bad units with new ones which do not have the problem. Instead Garmin does not acknowledge that the problem exists. I lost $300 when I bought the Edge 305 and Garmin has lost a customer."
2,Breakdown,"Buy this product if you don't mind- sending it back to Garmin for repairs every 4 months- paying for shipping costs- paying for repairs taking place a year (or beyond) from purchase- paying for repairs 90 days after the previous defect was repaired- waiting 20 minutes on the phone to talk to a representative to get the aforementioned good newsWhen it works, it's OK...the Motion Based Software is funIt is very easy to set.... but it will breakdown."
4,Excellent product,"Very pleased with the product, gives me all the information I want. Can customize screens to my needs, I did have trouble making the cadence function work... so I took it into a bike shop and had them figure it out."
3,Satisfied with my Edge 305,"Yes I am very satisfied with my Garmin 305. Delivered on time, as described in the site, without damages...working perfectly. I would rate as 5 stars.However after my first ride I got a big storm and the buttons Start/Stop and Reset/New Lap are not working as they were. I don't know if this was because of the storm (I suppose Garmin is waterprof) or because of the ride itself. I don't think so because I just got a single track and I am using just for XC purpose, the device didn't fall. The problem now is that I have to press the buttons stronger than before in order to make them work. That is way I rated as 3 starts....Regarding the baterries so far I don't face any issues. The satelite cover is working fine, cadence and speed sensor and Heart Rate as well.Please if anybody faced the same issue let me know.Best Regards."
5,Bike Computer,I love my Garmin Edge. This computer works perfect. I installed it myself and am really new to biking. It has been great for my weekly rides and it challenges me each time to get better when I ride by myself. The signal and data are extremely accurate and I have had no problems with this device. I highly recommend checking out the stats on [...] and also using it with Google Earth.
2,Receiver shuts off by itself,The forerunner 305 receiver occasionally shuts off by itself without warning. This is really annoying and affects your data at the end of your workout. I have seen this complaint in other forums as well. Shouldn't there be a recall or fix for this?! Some forum claims that this happens when you coast at the end of the lap or when in traffic or at a stop light. I hope there's a place in the receiver to adjust this auto shut-off annoyance.
3,"When it works, it is great.!","You need a bit of techno-knowledge to really appreciate this device. Just takes awhile to learn it's possibilities. Out of the box it seemed to work flawlessly, however, as I began to use it, it started to show some quirks. Contacted Garmin via email and received a quick response to the problems. The solution was to download a newer chipset. The unit worked again for a few days and then failed. Still looking for a solution. Installing the various pieces on your bike will take some time. Not wanting to fool with the installation, I took it to my bike dealer and they installed the unit the correct way. Worth the extra bucks. Now I just want it to work. Still waiting for a new solution."
2,If only it worked properly...,"I am a Category 2 racer, and I adopted the Edge 305 many years ago, and wrote a glowing review of it. The first one stopped working. The replacement stopped working. The next replacement stopped working. My wife's unit stopped working. The one that I have now has stopped working properly, randomly shutting off. It's a great design, but the electronics are flaky, with frequent lock-ups, shut offs, changing of program choices, etc. The battery life of 8 hours is woefully inadequate. When it works, it is awesome, and I know every function. The problem is, you need a spare for when you go to turn it on after charging, and it is locked up. I've had six of them so far and THEY ALL DO IT. Not recommended, but I am about to order another one, because MAYBE they've sorted out the problems."
2,Well... not my best purchess.,"I did like the product, and if it was working well, I would have be happy with it.The problems are:1. Battery life to short. I've been using it for 3 years, and battery lasts ~4 hours. that good for riding around the bloke.2. Some times the GPS, simply stoped working. and the, after a few days, it came back to live...! just like that!Now it does not work any more...! 3 years, and that's it!3, and the chest strap... lost it's flexibility after 6 months."
3,Great Device...but battery life is a real problem,"Took it out for my first real ride that was 5 hours total and 4 hours riding time. By the end, I had 1 bar left on the battery meter. This is a real ;problem if your into long rides like Centuries and Double Centuries. There is no way you can take this device on a 12-18 hour without it shutting off on you.I would rate it a 5 out of 5 as a bike computer. Love the fact you can populate the fields with whichever element you choose; heart rate, speed, etc. The heart rate monitor was good as well.It weight less than the Ciclosport HAC4 for those weight weenies who might imagine this device as a boat anchor.The lousy battery life relegates this a toy for me however, as I really want need this device to stay on for the 12 hour+ rides."
2,Caveats!,"Pros: 1. Accurate mileage if you stay in the open. 2. Basic GPS information with maps.Cons: 1. You will lose the signal sporadically in the woods. 2. Cadence needs constant adjustment. 3. Calorie count grossly inaccurate. This past summer I rode 100 miles on the Blue Ridge Parkway and calories were barely counted on the ascents. On the flats, calorie numbers are about about 40 percent inflated. 4. Software doesn't work with Macs. 5. Expensive.Recommendation: Until Garmin does a software fix, avoid this item. If you're going to spend the money, go with a Suunto T6."
3,okay,"These cutters are fine. I do make better squares with these then I do with a straight blade. My only dislike about them is that the metal overlaps at the ends, so instead of having four nice edges, I have three, plus one side with a funny spot."
5,"Honest, inspiring, grabs on and keeps going.","Early 1800 period piece with many charaters. Gives a wonderful view of the troubles and trials of early Irish immigrants. Clean, Christian reading yet still has heart and story. Everyone is human and not above sin. The people are easy to like and make you want to know more about each and every person. I came to love them all. And wanted to shake some sense into a few. The only disappointment is not having the next Book. Where is it????"
5,Masterpiece of this Time,Thank you B.J. Hoff for a wonderful novel that truly brings together that time period. It is wonderful for the Christian book-lover.
5,An Undiscovered Gem,"This is an undiscovered gem! I read this book with my daughters and we all found something different to enjoy, whether it be the story, the pictures, the message or the cast of characters. This book has sparked conversation on our family and style of parenting, we keep going back to look at it again. By the way, my daughters are 20 and 22 and wondering what sort of parents they may be."
1,Don't waste your money,"The author spends half of the book telling you about the ""business"" of auto body repair, then glosses over the actual ""how-to"". I bought the book to learn how to fix simple dents on my vintage car. Looks like I'll have to buy another book to find out how to do that."
2,Way too small,"This calendar is almost too small to function. I wanted to get it for the monthly view, and instead of spreading out the month on two pages, they try to fit it all onto one of those 3 inch wide pages. I was expecting it to be at least half a foot in width once open! After all the good reviews I expected something a little more practical."
4,Good variety of source documents,"This book through important source documents shows the major trends of British history from the Glorious Revolution to the rise of the modern welfare state. Essential emphasis is placed on the power of Parliament and the increasing British sufferage, but important cultural changes are examined as well"
4,Good Start...,"Excellent documentary for kids to understand the importance of their diet and where their food comes from. Infact half of the grown ups in US need to watch this documentary since when it comes to diet, they are as clueless as kids otherwise they would not be obese, overweight, out of shape, with so many health problems. This would be a good documentary for the Congress of America, which supports the big agriculture companies with no respect for soil, small farmers, this planet, and the true cost of obesity in US. Sorry, they do understand, but they are more interested in their pocket books instead of what they are retained to do which is representing the citizens of this beautiful country. Bravo."
4,Conservative in Some Respects,"Essentially a book that attempts to frame options trading in a world where your fundamental analysis of a company will drive strategy. The basic assumption of this book is that you can effectively analyze the fundamental strength of a stock and that you can execute several options strategies to increase the income generated from the stock. However, many of the strategies presented still require one to utilize technical analysis (e.g., choose strike prices based on support-levels), as well as provide little in the way of strategy modiifcation if the company's fundamentals change during the life of a call. This is a good book for developing some new investment strategies, however the reader will benefit if they have a good understanding of technical analysis as well."
1,Tedious mush,"There may be some worthwhile content somewhere in this book, but after many pages of slogging through tedious repetition and a near absence of organization I gave up. Read the free material on Morningstar instead."
2,Good theory. . . but terrible presentation,"The book presents valid ideas but is so poorly editited I can only give it two stars. It is full of errors and some of the assumptions in option pricing would never exist. Did the author even re-read what he wrote? I would not consider myself an ""expert"" but I have read and studied stacks of books on the subject and traded options for years. I also utilize his strategy for my portfolio.Having said all that I would still recomend this book simply for the validity of the strategies presented, but only if you already have a good knowledge of options investing so you can identify the mistakes.This book is recomended by many other authors of options related books. They could not have actually read the book or they would never have endorsed it. And the last point makes it hard to believe any further recomendations they would make on other authors.Jim"
3,Not pragmatic. Too much talk.,"The ratio of talk to concrete examples is 85% to 15%. I like straight to the point books, that can and should reinforce important points but keep the fluff to a minimum..."
5,Loved it,"Great movie. I really liked this movie. There was a lot of action and the cinematography was great. I liked the storyline and the acting was spot on. It was funny, unpredictable but also dramatic. It's one of my favorite movies."
3,good for the beginner,"I bought this DVD when I bought my first upright bass (at age 52). I needed something to get me off on the right path, to help me build strength, to get my posture corrected, and to get some basic knowledge about the construction and care of the instrument itself.This DVD provided all of those things I needed quite readily. There is lots of good advice here. After I adjusted my posture, several chronic pains I was having went away.Mr. Philips makes a nice, easy to understand presentation.The idiom of music for which he prepares the student is plucked style, folk, bluegrass, country, or gospel bass playing.So, if you need classical instruction, with a bow, this is not the DVD for you.It was a good way for me start, even though I have now gone with a real teacher."
1,spell check would be nice,"this book is a joke. words are spelled wrong which makes the writer look innocent. this person hurt many people and changed lives. the pennal system is a joke thought, it is too lenient."
5,NEW AGE MUSIC THAT MOVES & GROOVES,"Some new age music is so soft and ambient that it doesn't stick in my consciousness. This album, however, has strong melodies and a wide variety of instrumental sounds. I especially like the bass lines. He sings in some kind of weird language on the first and last tunes, but I dig it. The music is good for relaxation, but there is enough going on to hold my interest. I suggest you listen to it turned up fairly loud to hear all the little things going on."
2,Not quite what I expected,Looks like a dog skeleton but closer inspection reveals a number of inaccuracies. 14 ribs- really? Dorsal processes of the thoracic vertebrae running the wrong way. Flat feet. Patella on the tibia? No fabellae. Nice to look at but not a fabulous learning tool for a vet student
1,Stay away from this,This is not the full Toast software - but the limited feature version that comes with CD burners. It says right on the disc - not for resale - and it doesn't include all the features lists in the bullet points.The software you want is Toast Titanium.
3,Bob Hope Learns About Love the Swedish Way in Cute 1960's Comedy,"While it would never be considered anywhere near the best comedy Bob Hope ever made ""I'll Take Sweden"", has it's own quaint charm coming as it does from a much more innocent age in movie making. The ""sexy"" goings on in the storyline, probably considered 'risque"", back in 1963 now of course seem positively tame by today's standards which in my belief gives this film it's antique appeal. The film was in many ways a wise career move for veteran comedian Bob Hope as here he succeeded in moving with the times, placing himself right in among the supposed ""hip"" movie going crowd of the mid 1960's who would have gone to see this film mainly because of it's two young and extremely popular costars in the beautiful Tuesday weld and singing sensation turned movie actor Frankie Avalon."
4,"Nice, but doesn't look galvanized.","I used this on my chicken coop. Although the description states ""Galvanized before welding"", the wire did not have the traditional matte galvanized appearance of mesh I purchase at the local hardware store. It has a very bright finish. Since I live near the ocean, I painted it all with enamel paint to retard oxidation. This was a pain and may have been overkill.The wire is heavy gauge and I didn't have any welds break while I was cutting and bending.If the fencing really was galvanized, and hold up to the elements, I'd give it 5 stars, but if it's a rusty mess in a year, I'd give it only 3."
2,Poor quality,Very poor quality lots of broken welds and crooked wire where the gaps spread out. Not the best for cages.
3,Galvenized?,I've looked all over the packaging that came with this roll of wire fencing and nowhere does it say that the product is galvenized. Can Amazon prove what they advertise as galvanized is? The product was made in China by the way.
1,I couldn't get it to work.,I have an IBM laptop running Windows XP. I was unable to get this card to work. I went to Office Depot and bought the Belkin card and it worked immediately. I cannot reccomend the Startech card.
3,Firewire: yes; USB: No,"The IEEE 1394 (firewire) connectivity through this card with my ThinkPad was flawless, but I was unable to get the USB drivers to work. I have had the same problem with an Adaptek dual function card on multiple ThinkPads (T40 and T42), so perhaps the USB problem is peculiar to IBM (now Lenovo) notebooks. It was nice to get a firewire cable included for this price."
3,CB2U2F,"The firewire portion of the card works well. However, I have not successfully able to get the USB2.0 to work with my computer. I have called the company for tech support and they are very responsive."
4,Very helpful according to patient's with this condition.,"As a Family Physician I see LOTS of patients with MVP who have multiple symptoms and questions. I stumbled across this book one day in the medical center bookstore. I ended up buying it buy the case to have available for my patients. They recommend it highly.J. Phelan, MD"
5,"THANK YOU, Lynne Frederickson!","THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! I have been ""suffering"" with multiple symptoms for the past 15 years with no idea they were all connected! I read this book last night and I am amazed to find out I am not going CRAZY! Today, I have a new outlook and knowing that I can go foward from here is a great relief!"
1,more psycho-bable than anything else!,"This book loves to bash those suffering from MVP. After reading this book i am convinced that the author believes people with MVP are neurotic, immature and in need of therapy for the cardiac condition! Don't waste your money unless you want a laugh as this book is a joke."
4,Damn good ambience,"This is a very good example of creative, uplifting ambient music. It's all very mellow and creates a relaxed, hypnotic vibe, but never degenerates into boring, repetitive electronic noodling (well, almost never; just skip the first track of disc 1). The songs rely on a variety of multi-cultural samples and, as the title suggests, they conjure up images of exotic landscapes and the rhythyms of the natural world. I give it four stars instead of five just because the overall quality of the songs isn't quite up to the standard set by the Interchill label on its previous compilation, ""Interior Horizons."" Get that one first, and if you like it, move on to ""Ekkocentric."""
5,Appetite for Destruction,"In Appetite for Destruction, Gene writes about how guns and roses emerged from an LA club that legends Van Halen, Motely Cure and poison, also emerged from. Gene gives an excellent point of view of how hard they had it when they first started. He continues to write about how even know they had numerous albums and concerts, the luck for the band, just kept on getting worse. From someone's head getting stumped in ar a mush pit at one of their concerts, to alcohol and drug overdoses.It talks of how slash tried to over came his drug problems and how Axel had a huge control issue over the band. This band was created of friendship and ruined by greed, corruption, drugs and alcohol. It even tells you secrets of songs and stories of them. I would give it 5 stars."
4,Scary,I haven't gotten all the way through the book but it scared me enough not to want to go through the effort of inventing and marketing something.
4,A powerful book,I like this book because there are orginal methods I haven't seen in any other book. You can buy the book and see what to do if someone rips off your product (You make money addressing the issue). Or you can spend thousands in legal fees! This one method is worth many times the cost of the book in my opinion.Michael Waller
2,It's all right...,"Nothing new or original. What we have here is a cd of already established, previously released, original version, but none the less good deep house music that is just simply mixed and cross faded together. If you are a new comer to House music than you will like this cd. For those who have a good collection of House, you will find that many of these songs are from some of your other cds. For exellent, funky, infectious, deep house, you should buy Nude Dimensions Naked music. Tracks 6 and 13 from this cd are on it. You'll love it."
4,Decent bag could use more structure,"This is a straightforward mat bag, made of machine-washable fabric. It fits myManduka eKO 71-Inch 5mm Eco-Friendly Yoga Matwithout problem and seems to have enough for the 85-inch version (if rolled snugly).The two negatives that make this 4-stars are the lack of an adjustable strap which may make carrying the loaded bag uncomfortable over a distance, and the lack of bag structure.The last is the bigger issue, it's a little bit of a struggle to get a mat into the structureless bag. Some kind of structure in the bag (even just a silicone collar inside the opening) would probably have made the loading process easier.All-in-all, a decent basic bag."
5,It's about time...,An electrifying time in American history. Steinhorn has hit it right on the head with the contributions of the Baby Boomers tosociety in this era. They are not the overindulgent that they have been portrayed to be but they are the imputus to change in America. They have embraced diversity like no other generationand have made us all stop and take stock of our own moral values. Hats off the Leonard Steinhorn for bringing this to light.John Arcbibald
2,"Congratulations, Me Generation!",This is a decent read. The argument is more compelling than the book itself. Expect more self-congratulations from the Baby Boomers over the next 20 years.
1,A book that only a Boomer would have written,"Because, God knows, his parents or kids wouldn't have. Sometimes stereotypes exist because they contain a germ of truth. Baby Boomers are stereotyped as selfish, shallow, greedy and egotistic because, well...they are selfish, shallow, greedy and egotistic. And they won't even have the grace to do what everyone else in the country wants them to do--kick off, already. They'll be the longest-lived, whiniest, silliest generation ever, and they won't shuffle into oblivion until they've drained every dollar from their grandkids' pockets and paved over every pasture for luxury retirement estates and golf courses. Of course, the demographic who'll be paying their bills won't be getting misty-eyed over their noble forebears, either, so maybe their retirements won't be that pleasant."
2,Liberal acadamic,An interesting premise with some good points spoiled by barbs thrown at the conservative right. Just about what I would expect from an East Coast professor.
5,Red Madison Tote by Buxton,"I bought this large tote about two weeks and really love the organizational aspects of it. It's very roomy with several different compartments that hold all my business items perfectly. I can unzip the two outside areas to drop it down for easier access. I really wanted this particular one after shopping around because it has specific holders for pens, a cell phone and a PDA. The red is beautiful and the handles are just the right length."
5,Yummy,"I like the new pop-ness about it. A yummy 10 minute instramental makes me totally space out. I very much like it. Mark Linkous did it again. (but this time more happy).Anyway, I love this band. The album is no let-down."
5,Favorite Sparklehorse Album,"This is a solid album, and there are more songs that have stuck with me than the other Sparklehorse albums. With the exception of the closing track, this album avoids the monotony that makes Good Morning Spider hard for me to listen to all the way through. Even if you don't purchase the entire album, Don't Take My Sunshine Away and Some Sweet Day should be listened to."
4,"completely brilliant, absorbing","i have everything Linkous has done--and this record is so rewarding, beautiful,conducive to obsession/compulsion, etc. etc. the melodies veer toward theslower, rippingly trippy beatle-esque and tearing, soaring/dreamy pop of...well, earlier Sparklehorse.there are insanely lovely baritone guitar bits (brittle and low) and tunes that evoke in some weird way other songsthat seem like a bit of an homage...Linkous' lyrics are reliably bizarre and heartfelt and homespun, so to speak--the little touches (headphone bait) here aremagical--making this record have legs, as it were.a masterwork--5 stars are for undeniable classics like ""revolver"" and""loveless"" and such...i am so lucky to know this band.other things to investigate, popwise: the black watch, ""tatterdemalion"";sun kil moon ""ghosts of the great highway""; anything by spiritualized; and the new Yo la tengo record--all are immense!!!!!"
2,Eh,I feel like there's a lot of potential. I just spent the entire cd waiting for something more.... but it never came.
1,Completely Dissappointing,"Here's a musician/songwriter/producer's view of the album if you find that sort of thing useful: After the AMAZING ""it's a wonderful life"" this album completely dissappoints, the first two tracks are quite good and up to standard, but the rest are weak...whilst there are a few cool sounds dotted throughout them, the chords used are predictable, boring, and don't display any of the songsmith skills demonstrated on the previous album. i'm guessing he thought that no-one would notice the crappy chords if he put enough weird noises in. don't get me wrong, i LOVE weird noises, but the harmony of the song has to be up to scratch too. oh and the last track is the most boring thing i ever heard, i like the odd ambient piece but it was just dull as dishwater.i kept the first two tracks on my itunes and deleted the rest."
5,FUN Fun fun........,We've had this product for a while now and its still a hit at home. All the kids and young adults that come to our house play with it.We play relays in the pool with this so It is not only fun but durable.
3,It's ok.,"Not made for adult males (kind of painful) however, I'm sure kids will have a ball. It may last one swim season.*update* I was right, it lasted one summer. It is funny as ever watching adults and kids trying to mount the log....priceless."
3,pretty fun,"Kids love it - though it's very hard to stay on - but that's most of the fun for the kids. ours has had kids / adults of all ages on the logs, and have stayed inflated for a month now, so they're pretty durable. worthwhile for the price"
1,Dont get this unless you want lacerated legs and head injuries,"The title says it all. The logs are difficult to get on and hurt your legs. They have edges that gouge you. The jousting sticks also hurt. I guess I'm the fool- its a toy designed to hit each other with in the pool, what did I expect?"
2,Difficult to use,"We though this would be a lot of fun, but they are impossible to stay on for any period of time. Unless there is a trick to it, many people varied in ages tried and no success."
3,Riding the log,We purchased this log joust set for our two grand children. It definitely is not a run of the mill pool toy and several children expressed interest in it when we visited a local pool. Several kids of different ages and a few adults took turns trying to ride the log as shown but it is a very unstable float which rolls over very easily. The challenge was to see who could ride it the longest; never more than a few minutes unfortunately. The kids then used the jousts by themselves to float in the pool; that worked even better.
2,Log Flume Joust Set,"The Log's are round which wont let the children stay on, not even for a second. Every time the child gets on it they fall off Quickly. They dont get to Play a game at all so its just not fun for them."
3,Logs,"Sturdy toy for kids. They played with it most of the summer, had races but very hard to stay up which could be frustrating"
3,Pool Play,Shipping was as expected...The product design could use some adjustments...The kids had fun with it ...Problem was it was very difficult to get on them and stay balanced from the start..They have a tendency to tip over very easily..The logs ended up under the pool deck...They had more fun with the poles.
1,Hard to balance,"Even when deflated somewhat, these were very hard to balance on. Also not good for kids as they could easily become more aggressive and wack each other in the head very hard. Had to do a lot of monitoring when they played with this, which was very short-lived. Water volleyball game what a much better purchase"
2,Not what I expected,"I got this for my husband. He was planing on taking a motorcycle ride that was going to take him over some very high altitudes. This watch is much more suited to hikers, as the altitude only changes every two minutes. This made it useless for our needs. I ended up returning the watch. This has taught me one very important thing. Look up the owners manual to see if the product is exactly what you want. It is also very large."
3,casio pathfinder watch,"The altimeter does not function correctly, but the compass seems to do well,and the alarms can not be heard. The barameter reads true to local weather stations,and the solar powered battery charger seems to keep the battery at full charge."
5,Best solar watch (with titanium band and the other features) you can have for the money,"This watch have a very solid construction, is almost imposible to make a scratch to the crystal, endless power (the solar feature), the thermometer and the compass are very accurate, but the altimeter have some range of error. 2 freinds mine have purchase this watch after i show them my Casio."
5,Very light & usefull watch,"I use this watch for 2 things go to the beach & hiking on the mountains. I needed a ligth watch, that could give me a lot of features and accomplish some task and of course a certain level of resitance. This watch has it all! No need to exchange the batteries (les need to open it) is the best feature"
2,The Worst Customer Support,"This WATCH rates four stars. It is light and rugged. I found its functions (aside from telling time) to be helpful, and sometimes fun. However, when my wristband wore out and needed a Casio replacement I discovered, painfully, what a poor company Casio really is. Casio has only two authorized parts outlets in the U.S. (one being only 10 miles from my home, and the other being in New Jersey). I contacted the parts department, and ordered a replacement band and was told that my order would take about three weeks to fill. That was in the summer of 2005. Every month since I ordered a new wrist band I call the official parts supplier and they say the same thing, that nothing has arrived, and that Casio simply fails to honor their orders for wrist bands. I've contacted dozens of watch parts supply houses and hear the same thing.The Bottom Line: A pretty good watch, but good luck getting parts."
3,An Entertaining (But Exhausting) Film,"None can deny the uncertainty that surrounds the Philadelphia Experiment. It is a moment in time that has been perfectly preserved (and perfectly redefined by countless theorists). And, now, that moment can be thoroughly examined.""The Philadelphia Experiment: Invisibility Time Travel and Mind Control - The Shocking Truth"" is a lesson in oddity--and one that mostly succeeds. Its combination of interesting interviews and uncomplicated production values allows the viewer to immerse themselves in conspiracies and too-long buried secrets. It's a fascinating glimpse that will appeal to most.""The Philadelphia Experiment"" suffers from one true problem, however: its run-time. This film would've been better served if minutes had been sliced from its final cut. It loses both its ability to educate and to entertain by dragging on. Viewers may find themselves restless by the end... but the journey will still be worthwhile."
2,Philadelpha exp,Very tuff to watch without falling asleep or just throwing in trash. Intresting if you make it throught the hole thing as I did but you better be a real sifi guy or this is just more trash
5,The Unexplainable Explained,"This is a very good book to read if you are stuck in your guitar playing. I originally started playing the guitar to be like my idols on TV when I was [..]. That lasted until I was 13. Now in my 40's I want to play for myself and for personal growth. I just couldn't seem to get back what I had learned as a child so I started reading music theory books(The Complete Idiots Guide), and other self-improvement books. Jeff Peretz's book teaches from a unique perspective which gets me really excited and motivated to play again with commitment and a plan. Trying to play like your idol is ego based and doomed to fail. Learning to play from your heart (utilizing Zen) is better. Words cannot capture zen, but this book goes an extra mile trying to explain it for those of us who are alien to it. Good job Jeff Peretz! My future mastery over my guitar is now far more likely thanks to your book. Wish me luck, I still have a long journey ahead of me."
5,2 Good 2 B-Lieve,"Man this record is off the hook and all I have to say is that the West Coast Underground will be on top and they are starting to get there!Grouch is a tight mcee!Murs rules the world!Eligh rips on the mic, man all these guys are dope on the stage! this is a for sure go getter!"
3,Okay Film with Funny Moments,"I'm a Eric Stoltz fan. He was wonderful as Lester.The film had its funny moments, but there were problems. First, it annoyed me that there was so many voiceovers by the narrator. This is unnecessary because it could have been shown in the film as dialogue. In writing it's call ""show me don't tell me"". The voiceovers affected the flow of the movie. Second, the ending seem quite contrived. I guess Lester forgave Ramona for sleeping with Dashelle when she was seeing Lester, but Lester's forgiveness wasn't quite clear."
2,Not anamorphic,"This movie is an overlooked gem. Unfortunately, the DVD presentation is shoddy -- it's not anamorphic video, so you'll be looking through a mail slot on your 16:9 television screen."
5,Insecurity at its Best,"Mr. Jealousy stands out to me as being a well developed and intelligently plotted film. Sadly, as a 90's ""wanna-be Indie"" movie, it did not go very far. Perhaps its biggest flaw is that the ""hero"" is really no hero at all. He is your everyday guy that struggles with deep psychological issues that are richly translated into humor and sometimes romance.I find that the narrating does not ever seem to fall short throughout the entire film. It has a hint of quirky irony and judgmental edge that makes you giggle to yourself, however the humor is mostly because you can relate to this fellows everyday thoughts.Each character is very well developed. Even though they lack perfection, they draw you into their personal lives.In my opinion this is one of the most deeply ""felt"" movies that I have seen in quite awhile. It is not typical Hollywood drama and cheap laughs, its genuine insecurity at its best!"
5,The Best....,"One of my personal favorites, although there is alot of them, happens to be Mackenzie's Mountain.With a southern teacher and a half breed Indian, what more could you want.Mary, newly moved into town, finds out that Wolf's son Joe dropped out of school. Doing the right thing she goes over and demands to know why.With a town hostal against Wolf because of a charge he didn't do, the town has never excepted them. But when Mary moves is the lines begin to waver and some one out there doesn't appreciate it much.With the town in an up roar with only one man to blame, thinks strt to get intersting.From the start I liked this book. With a hero who has strong erges and a heroine more than willing to explore them, it was a go from the start.Comapired to other books I have read that featured any type of indian, I like the way Linda Howard betraied her's best. I highly recommend this book, and hope that you enjoy it as I have!"
3,What year was the setting for this story?,"I'm a big fan of Linda Howard's more recent work (Son of the Morning, Kill and Tell, All the Queen's Men, etc.) and this is the first book about the McKenzies I've read. I'm sorry, but if this story was post-Vietnam, the naivete of the heroine was just too much to be believable. Hadn't she ever seen an R-rated movie? And the open bigotry of the small town toward anyone of Indian heritage also seemed way too outdated. This is not the first time that I've been disappointed by LH's earlier work. I love her longer contemporary novels so much that I keep looking for something I may have missed. I guess I'll just wait for her next release."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed it and could not put it down. The story was easy to read with the right pace and the plot development was not too heavy, just the kind of book you like to curl up and immense in during weekend or vacation. I like the chemistry between Wolf and Mary, it was as if they were meant for each other right from the beginning. Joe was very likeable too and it's great to know that there is a book on him and more. Both men and Mary were so protective over the persons they loved that they appeared to belong to each other as a family. It's a story that you feel good reading it."
5,"Not great, but definitely worthwhile.","Mackenzie is 1/2 Native American Indian, 1/2 Scottish and owns a horse and cattle ranch. Mary is the new school teacher. She falls for Mackenzie and fights the small town prejudice against Indians. I enjoyed this story. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: about five. Setting: current day small town in Wyoming. Copyright: 1989. Genre: contemporary romance."
2,B O R I N G ...One of 100 best romance books? Are you kidding me?!,"Omg why was this book on 100 best romance books?! For me it would not even make it on 200 list...I thought they were in 'lust' through most of the book, not love. I don't get it. Why it had so many good reviews, I don't know. It wasn't that good,in my opinion. It still baffles my mind that some readers think it's the best book they ever read. Wonder what kind of books they've read to consider this one so good. Not worth the money or time to read again, to me. It's a good book to donate once you've read it. It took me a long time to finish reading it. And I had to finish because I was curious to see if it got better and I always like to finish a book I start anyway..."
2,One of her best? Hard to believe.,"I'd been hearing a lot about Linda Howard, so I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who said it was one of her best. If it truly is, I'm wondering why this author is so popular.The story is a cliche from beginning to end--the tough, taciturn half-breed, the too-sweet-to-be-believed heroine, and the town's over-the-top racism.I could forgive the cliches if I cared about the characters, but I didn't. There was no spark to them, and the author told the reader what the characters were feeling rather than showing the emotions through actions or dialogue. The book read like a synopsis of itself, and I found myself wondering where the actual story was.I realize Linda Howard is a wildly popular author, but reading this book left me asking ""why?""I won't be in a hurry to buy more."
4,I just love family series!!,"I started reading Mackenzie's Magic as it was one of the short stories in Christmas Kisses. I then realized that it was part of a series, and though I was enjoying it so much, I quite reading it, as I hate to read out of order. I then bought Mackenzie's Mountain, as it was just reprinted, and am loving it!!!! I appreciate the reviewer who stated that Joe's story is being re-released, and that Chance's was coming out, but does anyone know if Zane's story is going to be re-released?!! I just can't live without reading all of the installments!!"
4,This is not a sophomore slump,"I'm not that good at reviewing music anymore, but I thought I would give this a shot since there are no other reviews for ""Version Soul.""If you are gun-shy about Ken Vandermark's various side projects/offshoots, you can buy this one with confidence. Dare I say it, I think a song like ""Size Large"" can out-funkify anything from the Spaceways, Inc. debut album (the one of Sun Ra and Funkadelic covers, if that gives you any perspective).There is room for Vandermark's plaintive side too with ""Rothko Sideways,"" which refers to, I believe, the time Mark Rothko accidentally left a painting of his sideways on his easel and almost didn't recognize it. Is that the story? Tell me if I'm wrong.As a deviation from Ken Vandermark's day job with his quartet, you can get away with saying that Spaceways, Inc. really comes into its own on this release. A very good album, even if it's not talked about that much."
1,downgrading Claudel to a copy of Rodin,"Camille Claudel was too genuine, too proud an artist to ever allow her work to be a copy of Rodin's. Who knows maybe it should be the other way: Rodin copying Claudel..."
1,Terrible workout,The cardio portion of this video didn't even raise my heart rate. I barely broke a sweat after 30min into the DVD. I had not worked out much for a while before doing this and got nothing from it. I found it very basic. I would not recommend this product.
1,Forget it -- If you don't have Windows 95/98!,"My son was heartbroken when we could not install this game on our PC with Windows XP nor on our PC with Windows NT nor on our laptop with Windows 2000. Windows XP and 2000 can install and run most software designed for earlier versions by adjusting the program properties to run as 95/98, but not this one. We tried everything imaginable and even contacted Disney Interactive (no response), but nothing worked. I wish I could have read ALL customer comments, so I would have avoided this useless purchase. AMAZON, PLEASE ADD A COMMENT SUCH AS ""NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY VERSION OTHER THAN WINDOWS 95/98"" SO YOUR COSTUMERS DO NOT WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY!!!."
1,"Good Movie, Bad Game","You can't play the game in Windows full-screen mode,(I played it on a new Windows 98) The graphics look like 1973 (if thay had games back in 1973)Buy The Tarzan Action Game Not This One"
1,"Offensive, brutal, and archaic","As other reviewers have already stated, this is old school training that relies upon physical intimidation and pain to gain compliance. Mary Twelveponies does emphasize the importance of building trust between horse and human, but I fail to see how that is possible with the threat of physical punishment for disobedience.If the rider is the problem, why is it necessary to use harsh corrections for the horse? Would the rider learn how to communicate better and faster when punched in the face with a nail?"
1,This author would be lost around horses without her WHIPS!,".""With all of the great books for horse people and horses out there, there's no reason to buy this book."" That's what respected trainers told me. I wish I'd listened and saved having to throw it in the garabage, but I liked the (misleading) title and it was on sale, so I learned the hard way."
2,Mixed Feelings.,"This book seems a mixture of harsh ideas and sensible ones. On one particular page, the author used to phrase 'hit my horse' over and over again and in general made me cringe. On the other hand she has sensible answers to somebody's problems with a pony that was being pushed too far, too fast. My guess is that the apparent harshness is partially a matter of language, and that she means well."
1,Don't fake punch your horse!,"This book is about old fashioned horse breaking. She is correct to say that there are no problem horses, only problem riders, and if you follow her advice you will become another problem rider. For example, it is not productive to ""fake"" a punch in your horses face if he isn't leading properly. You may get him to stop but he will not trust you as a leader, and he will eventually let you know that. In addition, no ""natural"" horse trainer would encourage you to leave a problem puller, tied outside, for several hours (or even better, all day) for several days in a row to ""break"" this problem. You have denied your horse food, water, companionship, and created stress, panic and fear. Do you think that this horse knows why? This is a dangerous book and will only produce what breaking does, that is, Broken horses."
4,Good advice,For inexperienced horse owners. Knowledge is important and although her ways are not the only ways they are quite helpful.
5,Practical and realistic,"Mary Twelveponies provides excellent advice to riders on all levels. Her approach is practical and takes into account the importance of respect in the relationship between a human and a 1,000 lb. animal. I sent a copy to my neice to help her learn the necessary assertivness skills to deal with her typical ""new horse-owner"" type problems. A well-behaved horse is a joy to ride. Getting and keeping one that way takes some work. This book will help. Those who have called these techniques harsh should note that John Lyons wrote the forward. I found her approach balanced and clearly that of an experienced horsewoman."
5,Long-overdue tribute to the first rock journal,"Excerpts and recollections from the first 19 issues (February 1966-October 1968) of Crawdaddy!, the first magazine of serious rock music coverage and criticism. This was the period when rock & roll was transforming into rock, when new groups and sounds were a weekly happening, and the rock album was asserting its place in the market. It is fascinating to read the articles, reviews, and interviews by some of rock music's future premier writers such as editor/publisher Paul Williams, Jon Landau, Richard Meltzer, and Ed Ward, and to relive the history of the music in the reprinted news items and record release notices. Fans of rock history and pop music journalism will enjoy this long-overdue celebration of the orgin of the form."
3,"Oh, now, come on...","...let's be fair here. This may not be as good as some of his other books (for example, ""The Promise,"" which deals with the same subject as this book, or ""There's A New World Coming,"" my personal favorite) but at least the man deserves a chance. Find this at the library and read it before you start judging him."
2,Horrible....,I am taking Calc II and am using this book. This book is horrible! I missed a lecture and when I tried doing the homework I got stuck. There are no example like the examples. I am here on this site to buy companion book so that I can do better on my homework. I wish they would stop using this book at university level courses.
1,Not for the unwashed masses,"This book sucks for the beginning calculus student, what else can I say? Calculus is a magical, wonderful subject that should be explained by those philo-sophias who want as many others as possible to become one with the subject, too, and explained not by some egotistical maniac who takes glee in quashing the freshman spirit.Read some other books and commentary on James Stewart. Read his own supplement in which he puts down calculators and computers, staunchly defending his everlasting superiority in crunching numbers. LOL!He is the epitome of the eggheaded scholar that couldn't teach his way out of a bag. Too bad his books propagate this pedagogical joke of a professor."
2,Low quality calculus text,Calculus texts seem to have lost its rigorous approach to mathematics. The best book on the market to actually learn Real calculus is Calculus Volume I by Tom M. Apostol. James Sewert's book lacks proofs and examples. I think if you're going to pay top dollar for a math book it should have at least tons of examples as well as tons of problems to solve that will actually help the student in his/her studies in more advanced topics in math or science. My Calculus II professor even hated this book due to its lack of quality. I think publishers should try to publish higher quality books over time rather than pretty pictures of the same material to just force the schools to change over and collect the money. I would pick up Apostol's book to accompany this book in the studies of mathematics.
3,a good read,"This book by Sebastian Junger is interesting. He gives no final solution but raised a lot of good questions. He did a lot of good research and wrote so that it is interesting reading.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,Re-examining the Boston Strangler,"in the light of what the author says are his family's experiences with DeSalvo, the man who confessed to being the Strangler. It's a well-written, quick read, interesting in places, mostly because of Junger's connection to the Strangler, who worked as a carpenter on his mother's studio when Junger was a baby. There's some controversy about Junger's opinion that the one murder that was designated a [...] killing was really not the work of the convicted, although Junger vacillates on it. More of the book is dedicated to this one murder than any of the others. It is Junger's contention that the Strangler could have done it. He doesn't seem to say definitely, but he suggests. Also, it is a good question if the encounter between Junger's mother and the Strangler really did occur, or if it was imagined -- either by her or by him. The excerpts from old interviews with DeSalvo, the convicted Strangler, are chilling."
4,Overall Good Read,"This may not be a Perfect Storm, but Junger's still in excellent form here. Illustrates the racial inequities of the sixties--and perhaps of today as well."
4,Very Interesting Read,"I have been avoiding this book for a long time. It sounded good when I read the snippets of information on it, it just isn't the kind of thing I enjoy.Finally, I went ahead and bought it. It then sat on my night table for months.I knew I had to do it, but it wasn't easy cracking a book about a serial killer. The descriptions were chilling but not overly graphic or gratuitous. Junger made sure to keep the facts of the murders quiet and respectful, even in their gruesome reality.I knew nothing of the Boston Strangler, so I learned a lot about that time and how terrifying it must have been living in that area at that time.The grave injustices made my blood boil and have given me a new perspective. It was well worth the wait and a great read."
3,a false story,"Too bad Sebastian Junger tried to tie his own mothers episodes with DiSalvo to Bessie Goldberg. It was a stretch saying that DiSalvo murdered Mrs. Goldberg when everyone knows it was Roy Smith. If Mr. Junger had told the true story , there would have been no ""journalstic"" book, because Junger got the facts all wrong. He got them wrong to write fiction and that is what a ""Death in Belmont"" is. Its pure fiction. Book stores are placing it in the wrong column."
3,A death in Belmont,"I very much enjoy the books by Sebastian Junger, but this one wasn't of his usual caliber. It's ok relative to his other works and I would read them first."
4,"Good book, bad e-book formatting","I down loaded this e-book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The Author Sebastian Junger did an excellent job writing this e-book which clearly took a lot of research. The story weaved in and out of multiple events from the Boston Strangler murders in the City of Boston in 1963, to the execution of the president of the United States of America in the streets of Dallas Texas. Some history from the south and what life was like and how people where perceived by each other took me by surprise. I am glad I chose to read this e-book. I was very disappointed in the quality of the formatting. There were many pages with large spaces in between the words and there were some missing words and two Typographical errors . This did take away from the reading experience and annoyed me while I was reading the e-book. I have and would recommend this e-book to a friend to read. I would not recommend buying this in the e-book format though. Buy the paper back for this one."
3,interesting story that drags at parts,"Being a Boston guy who remembers talk of the Boston Strangler from when I was a kid, I was very interested in the topic of this book. The start of this story was riveting, describing the murder in Belmont, Massachusetts, a quiet suburb. Like good ""true crime"" books, there was good background on the people and the times. This is a fascinating mystery, with two suspects, but a mystery that drags on a bit. This could have been very well written in 100-150 pages, but the author had to drag it out to 250 pages, the minimum for a published book. I still enjoyed reading this in spite of that weakness. This ""unsolved"" mystery did get me to think about what really might have happened, and about the justice and injustice that might have occurred."
1,FICTION,"Why does the author keep so many of the vital facts of this well documented case from the reader? If the convicted murderer had cleaned the Goldberg home and left it in good order as he claimed, why then when Mr. Goldberg arrived home was the house still in disorder with the furniture in the middle of the living room, the living room ornaments on the dining room table and the vacuum cleaner and its attachments with Smith's handprints all over it still standing in the living room?"
2,Very age dependent rating.,I am sixty four and found little that I didn't already know about this story in Junger's book. It really doesn't have much to offer if you lived through the sixties and it certainly isn't a gripping account a la _In Cold Blood_. Capote had writing style -- and access to the killers and that makes all the difference.
2,Why bother,"I found the book mildly interesting while I was reading it, but the end was a little disappointing and left me thinking why did I bother reading it."
5,Superb,"Sebastian Junger has long been one of our finest nonfiction craftsmen , and ""A Death in Belmont"" goes far to solidify that reputation. In turns insightful and controversial, and always engaging, Junger's latest presents the facts of a case that captured his interest decades ago and will no doubt capture yours today. It is a story that, appropriate to the sometimes murky details of its subject, stresses questions more than answers, and leaves ultimate judgement to the reader. In short, it is as intellectually challenging and engrossing a read as I've come across this year."
1,DISAPPOINTED,This poorly written novel was a disappointment to me because I was told it was true crime documented by a famous journalist who had done his homework and fact checked the story. You could drive a truck through the holes in this book!
5,Junger Never Disappoints,"This is a great book. I do not fault Junger writing about events that transpired around one of the most famous serial killers in America; especially when you consider that The Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo, actually appears in one of Junger's family photos from his youth. I will say this much: If I had a picture of me with Ted Bundy, I'd be the first one to write a story about it. In fact, I am wondering what took Sebastian so long to write and release this book? This would have been my very first book had I been in his shoes. I place Junger's books in the same basket as my other favorite writers, John Irving and Erik Larson."
3,Cultural Context,"I read this book because of the interesting connection between the author's family and DeSalvo. However, I found it to be much more. As I too grew up in the same time period, I was moved with the way the author took me on a trip down my own memory lane: pre-civil rights movement life for Blacks in America, the assasination of JFK, women's roles in society, and child abuse suffered by the convicted DeSalvo. Weaving this into the story of the Boston Strangler case gave it a deeper meaning and made it a story we all share rather than just an isolated case. Why three stars instead of four? Well, there were places where I felt the author was a little repetitive and stretching to make this a book rather than a great Atlantic Monthly piece. However, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the 1960's, the history of Black Americans, or the DeSalvo case."
5,A Death in Belmont,"This is a fascinating true story, which just proves to me that truth is stranger than fiction. Junger tells a great story, from beginning to end."
3,A Bit Tedious,"Somewhat overwritten analysis of a Boston area murder case that overlapped the Boston Strangler serial killer spree back in the '60s. To try to make up for the somewhat thin material, Junger delves into tedious explanations of the justice system and takes extended looks into social issues concerning race and class. This is no ""Perfect Storm,"" if anyone is hoping that lightning has struck twice for this author. It's a competent book, just not especially interesting. I didn't bother to finish it because other better books came along."
1,Mediocre/Manipulative,"There have been many mixed reviews of this supposedly non-fiction book, so I finally decided to read it for myself to see what I thought. Given that I am a fan of Yunger's ""Perfect Storm"", I was predisposed to be favorably impressed once again. I wasn't. It's really just an average novel made to read like non-fiction.I thought the writing was much too jumbled and the story-telling seemed to ramble. The good part was that it was easy to get through it quickly.While I didn't study all the factual material surrounding this crime, it is quite obvious that Yunger leads the reader down a path by constructing a hypothesis that pretends to reveal the truth, but there are many significant material omissions. (For example, if the reader just had the opportunity to learn of and/or read highlights of the appeal transcript- appealed was denied- there would have been more balance.) But he used only the ""facts"" that told a story he wanted to tell and the conclusion he wanted people to reach."
2,Detail Man,"While I am always impressed with Junger's use of detail to set a scene, I was not impressed with the narrative plot driving the story. I picked up this book for an assignment on crafting a visual place through words. For a journalist using a spare and expository writing style, he incorporates unusually clear and precise details, setting the scene clearly for readers. However, his narrative wandered over, around and through itself so that readers were left with the feeling he had gotten lost in his own research. He used historical details to ground the story in time and relate it to larger world events. The events were recounted through paragraphs and sometimes pages of narration, when a passing reference would have sufficed for his intended audience. These seemingly random divergions caused the book to feel as if it was stuffed with fluff to reach the required page allotment. Though the book was sufficient for the intended assignment, it is disappointing when taken in its entirety."
3,Truth is stranger than fiction,"It's a good read but the discussion generally of what guilt and crime really are, the judicial system, and all that is pretty surface-like. We can all agree that having DNA now is a good thing and that fewer innocent people will be punished for their apparent but not real crimes.Some years ago I read about a young woman who killed her lover/husband and got away with it. You can imagine how I felt when I discovered that she had lived next door to me as a little girl for about six years or so. I know how Junger feels about his family's involvement with De Salvo."
1,Poor Journalism,"Poor JournalismReaders looking for a factual and honest True Crime thriller presented in a straight forward manner will be disappointed in Sebastian Junger's ""A Death in Belmont"". Junger desperately tries to tie his family's connection with Albert DeSalvo to the murder of Bessie Goldberg by conjecture and arguments not based in reality. Instead of a discussion of the strong case against Roy Smith or the affirmed conviction, after appeal, of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Junger diverts the reader with filler material and misinformation."
1,A Death in Belmont,The book is both manipulative and is not factual. So many omissions in this book make it an unpleasant reading experience. This is not a book to add to your library or a book to spent time reading as the power of the story in lost in a maze of twisted facts and missing facts. Sam Shawn
3,True Crime meets the Perfect Storm,"This is a fast-paced and interesting book, and does a pretty good job of bringing alive the racial and legal issues of the late 1960s.In an effort to be even handed, however, Junger leaves the reader up in the air as to his position on who committed one or several of the Boston Strangler crimes. I left the book feeling slightly unfinished. I wish the author had taken a stand and explained his reasoning."
5,Personal connection to a killer,"This book has an interesting twist to it. The author was photographed with the Boston Strangler when he was a year old. Starting there, Mr Junger sucessfully presents a most detailed account of a black man who was put away for the killing of a woman, whose murder most resembled the way Al Desalvo, the Boston Strangler, killed many other women. The detail here is incredible and the doubts raised of Ray Smith(the black man accused) and the doubts raised about DeSalvo as well as worthwhile."
1,A FICTIONAL account of a Death in Belmont,Sebastian Junger has written an FICTIONAL account of a murder that happened in his hometown. Roy Smith was convicted and lost his appeal in this murder (Mr. Junger omitted this in the book). I would not recommend this book because it contains inaccuracies.
1,WHY BOTHER?,"I was definately looking for an interesting read. I thought this book was based on""The Boston Strangler"", instead it's an intricate story about racism, the judicial system, and Sebastian Junger's Mother.Could any of this be true? Maybe I was more interested in the ""real story"" regarding Albert DeSalvo, than what I've read.It's a very misleading and disappointing book.I don't know why I bothered."
1,IT'S A LET DOWN,"I'm a HUGE fan of ""The Perfect Storm"", but this book didn't grasp me.You really want to believe there's a chance that Smith is innocent, but there's just no way it's possible. I think this would've been a better Novel than a Non-Fiction book.I feel that some of the story was unbelievable. I just feel LET DOWN!!!"
1,"IT SURELY WASN'T ""THE BOSTON STRANGLER""","What was the reason for writing this book?Is Mr. Junger trying to fool us in to believing it was ""the Boston Strangler""?Unfortunately, he leaves out pivotal facts that lead the reader to believe so.Why are writers (for example: ""James Frey"") calling their novels' NON-FICTION?This clearly is another take on ""fein the truth"". Give me a REAL STORY!!!!!!"
5,I've watched this over and over - spellbinder,"I can't add a lot to those other 5-star reviews. If you have an interest in ragtime, Piedmont blues guitar pickin', this performance will show you how it's done. If you're interested in storytellin', it's got that too, and it is all very entertaining. I especially enjoyed his ability to riff on Rev. Gary Davis' ""Two-step Candyman,"" his playing on Willie Brown's ""Mississippi Blues"" and some different lyrics on ""Rag Mama."" Anyone who is a fan of Red Skelton, Mark Twain, Victor Borge, or acoustic blues, should check this out.As a full disclosure: Roy Book Binder did generously give me a copy of this DVD himself, but it was an unusual circumstance and I don't think he even knows my name, so I'm not on his payroll or anything like that."
5,"""Great Show!""","I found a CD by Roy(a live show) in a flea market for a dollar and bought it because I had heard his name but didn't really know anything about him.I played the CD on the way home and was just blown away by the stories and his playing.When I found out there was some video of his live show,I had to have it.He can entertain an audience with just a guitar and a mike.That's not an easy thing to do,but his experience of performing since the 60's has given him a lot of stories and great blues songs.This video is a little over an hour long and I was wishing it could be longer.I love his playing and singing and really enjoyed the stories about Rev. Gary Davis,Pink Anderson,Mississippi John Hurt,and Honey Boy Edwards.He knew all of those guys and I'll bet he could tell hours of stories about them and others.I highly recommend this video."
2,I Have Seen Better,"These cards will provide the basic information on the drug(generic name, brand name, common side-effects); however, they seem to lack on assessments that you should give before, during and after the medication therapy. I often times find myself having to look the drug up in a drug book and copying those assesments onto the card. If you are a nursing student and need to use the cards @ clinical I recommend getting another set or having a good drug book handy."

5,One of My Favorite Mike Cross Albums!!,"I listened to High Powered Low Flying for first time today; and I played it over and over! From first song I was hooked. Comparable to Bounty Hunter and Irregular Guy for great/funny stories and great melodies and traditional music. It's great for the highway, especially those narrow mountain roads that curve to left and then to right! My boots were tappin' all the way!"
4,Great for my class!,These are just as described. I have my students string high frequency words on them for practice. It's fun for them and also develops small motor muscles!
5,Praying Wisdom into your Life Everyday!! What could be better!?!,This book inspired me to live a life that I could not have acheived on my own strength. Through praying the principles of the book of Proverbs into my life everyday - my perspective and my actions began to change immediately. For the good!! It's a powerful book. I recommend it to everyone wanting to make their life count!!
4,Happy with this product,"Based on their own experiences, two people had recommended that I take omega 3 fatty acids to prevent migraines. My past attempts to swallow fish oil capsules left me sick to my stomach. These are the first capsules I've tried that are easy to digest and have no fishy aftertaste."
2,Strawberry Flavored!,"This product seems comparable to most other fish oil pills I've purchased in the past. The only problem I have (and its annoying) is that these pills are strawberry flavored. No where on the product listing or on the labeling does it say they are strawberry flavored! It only says that they are ""odorless"" - not true - they smell like strawberry flavoring and cause ""strawberry burps"". I would prefer ""fish burbs"" to strawberry any day as the strawberry tastes very artificial."
1,Unsure about quality of my lasted batch.,This is my 3rd bottle of Jarrow's EPA-DHA. The first 2 were great and no issues.I keep the product in the freezer. Now with the latest bottle 1 in 4 gel caps are cloudy. That makes me question the quality of the product and or perhaps the heat got to it during shipping. I will be updating my review after my next shipment.UPDATE:I just ordered another bottle and still a little less then 1/2 the gel caps cloud up when placed in the freezer. This will be the last time I order this product as the product quality is in question. Pure omega 3 should not cloud up or freeze in the freezer and having a portion of them do so makes me wonder what is really in there.
5,this brand fish oil works for your health,It has significantly reduced my triglyceride level since I took this brand fish oil. Over all my health is also improved.
5,No fishy burps.,"The pills are not huge and are easy to swallow. I didn't experience the fishy aftertaste or burps. The amount of omega, both EPA and DHA is great so 1 pill a day is enough."
5,"Not only is this balanced in a ratio that is optimum, it is the highest grade there is!","EPA-DHA Balance contains pharmaceutical grade; ultra-purified EPA & DHA. So No worries about mercury contamination etc...For this supplement to work to its fullest capacity these 2 ingredients need to be in balance which according to the best research, these are!The capsules are not teeny tiny but neither are they ""horse pills"". I have no problem swallowing them nor do I experience ANY aftertaste, burping or ""fishy breath"".Whether you are wanting this supplement for heart health, memory or your mood, I think this brand & formula is a very good one. I have tried others from Swanson & Vitacost and prefer these."
4,This seems to be clearing up my skin,"I read in a review of another omega-3 product, that it is good for your skin. I've had some problems with stubborn acne on one side of my face near my hairline. It isn't a huge problem, but two or three bumps that never seem to go away. Since I have been taking omega-3 tabs, my skin has started to clear, about 90% or so. I am going to continue to take these for that benefit."
5,"Right balance, right price","When my doctor strongly recommended I start taking fish oil tablets I was not enthused. Friends who had done so reported the dreaded ""fishy burps"" and worse. I also was overwhelmed by the many types of fish oil available and might have remained no except the opportunity to try Jarrow Formulas EPA-DHA Balance. Noticing the caution about anticoagulants, I checked with my other provider and got the ""all clear"". The gel tabs were easy to swallow and did not have any fishy smell ot taste. I also compared them to other brands and am happy with the combination of oils (most brands do not have this combination )and the prie. Since I am making this a part of my daily health regimen, I will continue to come to Amazon for Jarrow Formulas EPA-DHA Balance. The prie is better and the formula works."
5,Love in an Elevator,This was Johnny's best CD. It didnt get its proper attention. They only played a few songvs off the CD on the radio. It is a great buy if you like mellow music. Johnnys voice is so sexy. I highly recommend.
3,So-So!,"As the title for this 1996 CD suggests, the more mid-tempo/ballad side of Mr. Gill are given more prominent on this release. Now this wouldn't be a problem if these songs were of the quality that we are used to on afore mentioned CDs by Johnny. What we have here are some half decent songs, that whilst not awful, are a par down on what we are used to from this artist. On to many of these songs, they all merge into each other. Only a hardcore fan/lover of quiet storm moment would fine anything of any value here. I never had my copy for long, giving it to my big Sister, who loved all things Johnny back then.As for the more the more up-tempo songs, 'I know you Want me is OK' as is 'So gentle'.This was the last Johnny Gill Cd I purchased( and I think that this was his last major solo CD release) With a voice like Mr. Gill has, this is a crying shame!"
2,His Voice carrys this Hit&Miss set:2&Half for me,"Johnny Gill is One of the Best Vocalists I've heard over the past 20 plus Years but alot of the time the Words&Music don't match His overall presentation. I dig the cut with Him&Roger Troutman&also R.Kelly's ""Someone to Love"".but the up-tempo cuts don't move me at all.this Album though isn't balanced out with much else that matches some of the better material&this set suffers from that.but if Johnny Gill ever got the right Stuff to work with He would Be scary."
5,Let's Get This Voice to The Top!!,"I remember this album when I was in the 4th grade. This album is a keeper. Both urgent and patient, sensitive and sultry, he raised romance to new heights. This album is filled with sensuous expressions of his intimate approach to love. He kept returning to a single theme that seems to unit his artistry intimacy. This album has been certified Gold, Remember, this was 1996."
5,This CD did not get the hype it deserves!,This is a really good CD.One that will never grow old. I've had it since it first came out and I don't recall ever hearing it on the radio. I happened to hear this playing in the music store and couldn't resist buying it. The perfect CD for a romantic evening. They could have stopped after track 10 as this CD would still be complete without the songs that follow. Great job Johnny!
4,Passionate and excruciating,"Nuala O'Faolain is so vivacious, so funny and filled with life, so honest in her writing that I find I can't put her books down, and yet I find I'm either laughing or cringing, one or the other, depending on the page or the paragraph. I swing violently from pro to con as I read anything she's written; in this memoir, she spends so much time celebrating (it sounds often like bragging) about the success of her last memoir, and then confesses, horribly, about the dark side of her feelings against the young daughter of the man she's in love with. But she is also insightful and brilliantly observant and filled with hope. I don't think I've ever been so compelled by a writer and at the same time, repulsed. It's her narcissism that makes her books so compulsively readable, combined with genuinely gorgeous writing. I can't wait for the next one, and I'll laugh and cringe some more."
1,Boring and less than mediocre,"The author should stick to her newspaper columns, as her chatty style gets horribly boring in a book with over 200 pages.She indulges in self-praise for being so erudite, stating all the books she read. Gee!!!Then she claims that Milan Kundera is a mediocre writer, that's why she would not read him. Well, if she never did, how does she know? How dare she insulting such a talented writer? At least books like Kundera's ""unbearable lightness of being"" have profundity and style. Something that this crappy autobiography really misses out."
2,Poor Follow-Up to the Great AYS,"Nuala is a talented writer, but we knew that already. I found this book a bit, well, boring. It was like reading my own journal - too much stuff that would be of interest only to me and, possibly, my closest friends or kin; ""boring"" to most others.She's an easy read, an acute observer, and (as far as I am concerned) one of the few writers who will address the issue of advancing age - or most other issues - with candor.I loved AYS, as did most readers. This smells like a commerical follow-up and lacks the appeal of the original. It could be 50% shorter, and be the better for it. Bit of a shame, Nuala."
5,Brutally honest and quietly moving.,Particularly the portions dealing with her jealousy of a child. It took guts to write this.
3,"""BUSTIN' OUT"" BUT,NOT ""BUSTIN' UP""","This album is SO different for me than, all the previous 'HAT's albums. The last track ""AND I DO JUST WHAT I WANT"" is the sound we are used to. I just can't explain it, you'll have to listen to it yourself MAN! It actually took me awhile to get into it at all. Maybe ROGER can explain where DAVY was going with this one."
3,Not Bad Later-Era Foghat,"I don't think anyone would argue that this is the best album Foghat released, but it's a fair batch of songs from 1982. Some purists accuse Foghat of going ""New wave"" in the 80s. The reality is that they never stopped being a good rock-and-roll band, staying fairly close to the roots of blues and rockabilly, and never going synth-crazy, as some did in this era. ""Slipped, Tripped, Fell in Love"" is the catchy lead-off track and single. The cover of Rodney Crowell's ""Ain't Livin' Long Like This"" is noteworthy and fun. Generally speaking, this is a looser-sounding album with a slightly more R&B flavor. On the other hand, the closing track ""And I Do Just What I Want"" is an out-and-out rocker. Not where I would start with a Foghat collection, but definitely worth the price of admission."
2,not challenging and kind of boring,I work out about six times a week and am an advanced exerciser. This workout barely got my heart rate up more than for a few minutes here and there. It was not very fun or intersting. It was one of my least favorite of the many videos I've done.
4,Anglocentric? Not hardly,"I find it odd that the previous reviewer considered Elizabeth David ""Anglocentric,"" as she spent most of her life irritating her fellow Englishmen and -women by attempting to awaken them to cuisines other than their own. In my opinion, David is possibly the finest food writer ever. Though not quite as good as AN OMELETTE AND A GLASS OF WINE, this book hardly constitutes her ""dregs."""
2,Dregs from the files of an Anglocentric food critic,"I bought this book based on a review in the New York Times Review of Books, as I recall, which painted it as being a great posthumous oeuvre of one of the top food writers of all time.What I found instead is that Elizabeth David is highly biased against entirely random things, and I am not sure why I should be interested in sharing, or even hearing about these biases; she has extremely arcane interests ranging from cookbooks of 400 years ago to the cuisine of some tiny region of Italy or wherever, to some obsure ingredient; and her writing itself is not particularly stimulating or enlightening. Furthermore, the entire book has a highly Anglocentric aspect which to me, at least, is irrelevant and uninteresting."
5,A Wonderful Album,If you are into the roots of many kinds of folk music as well as chamber music this album is for you. It's sincerity and grace just melts my heart. I absolutely love it.
5,FELICITACIONES CUAUTHEMOC,"FELICITO AL AUTOR DE ESTA COLECCION DE LIBROS, LOS CUALES ME HAN AYUDADO MUCHO EN MI SUPERACION PERSONAL, DESPUES DE UNA NIÑEZ Y JUVENTUD TAN TRAUMATICA Y DEPRESIVA. GRACIAS CARLOS CUAUTHEMOC, HAZ CAMBIADO MI VIDA."
1,un grito desesperado,worst service ever never received the book or a refund was told to wait 30 days for refund of 10 dollars. is just awful will never order anything from this system
1,Este libro nos hace sermones,Este libro trata de ser una novela y a la misma vez una guia para los padres de familia y el resultado es un libro muy extraño. Los personajes actuan de una manera bien rara y poco realista. Me decepcionó mucho. El autor hace sermones enojados.
1,Lean cosas mas interesantes,"Este es un libro muy bueno para evitar que la mesa de la cocina se mueva, para hacer una fogata, y cosas por el estilo pero no para leer. El estilo utilizado por el autor es tan simple que cualquier idiota lo puede leer, por lo tanto no representa un reto intelectual ni nada parecido. Se desarrolla en base a una historia irreal, con personajes acomplejados y plagiada de sermones retrógrados y filosofía ""chatarra"" con un muy peculiar mensaje y manejo de la moral y ética (aunque dudo que el autor conozca la diferencia). Si realmente te gusta leer busca otro tipo de literatura. Si disfrutas ver en la televisión ""Cristina"", ""Hasta en las mejores familias"" y cosas por el estilo entonces compra este libro."
4,Very good and warm,"This 1990 show, recorded in Nottingham, England, has Saxon performing a very strong performance. It is almost an intimate show, the audience is not very big, but the band (here with the line-up of Byford, Oliver, Quinn, Carter and Glockler)rocks hard as ever and, except if they are the best actors in the world, they seem to really be enjoying themselves, to be having a great time.Due to the cheap covert art and packaging, and also because this DVD release features an old performance, I had doubts about the quality. But I was pleasantly surprised, it's a very good show. (however, I warn you that there are absolutely no extras)."
4,"Eurocentric, but focused","Don't expect ""A concise economic history of the world"" from Cameron's work. Do expect, however, an excellent account of Europe's economic history. If you want a more global, less ""economic"" account of the pre-modern world, try Janet Abu-Lughod. As for the modern world, a synthesis of Cameron and Asian experts would provide the comprehensive picture Cameron's title implies."
2,Simple history lacking theory,"This book is too elementary, in terms of economic history, for even an intro level undergraduate book on the subject. For a better introduction see Braudel's ""Wheels of Commerce"". In addition, it lacks any discussion of theory(ies) or presentations thereof as to what drives growth and why it has occured in some areas and not others. After all, is this not the purpose of studying economic history?"
2,Better to buy the originals,"The Stevie Wonder of the early 70s was a true innovator and musical genius. The post-""Hotter Than July"" Stevie Wonder turned out far too much MOR and soundtrack pablum. Unfortunately this set relies too heavily on his 80s and 90s output. Skip it and buy a copy of ""Innervisions"""
1,Please don't buy this one,"While this cd contains alot of favorites, I feel that you should bypass this one, and purchase Stevie Wonder's At The Close Of The Century! By far, this is the best, as it contains virtually all of his all time hits.... YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!"
5,Stevie Wonder CD,"This seller was prompt, and the item I purchased was in great condition, just as it was advertised. I bought this Stevie Wonder - Greatest Hits album at a fantastic price, and I've enjoyed listening to it with my family here at home. It was a great purchasing experience."
4,TO THOSE WHO GREW ON THE WONDERS OF STEVIE,"I disagree with those who only enjoy the earlier works of Stevie Wonders. This is a great listening, highly enjoyable, and diversely arranged compilation! It has your ""get your blood pumping, heart-soaring, soul-searching, and booty-shakin"" tunes. If that isn't enough to satiate your taste for music, the univeral language, than you don't like Stevie Wonder. Because, this is very much a great part of his work. I don't feel you'll be disappointed, unless you didn't bother to look at the soundtracks and didn't see the connection between you and the the music. Enjoy!"
1,"So you ask, why only one star?","The reason I gave this release only one star (even though almost all of these songs are 5 stars in their own right) is the horrible way this whole package has been presented. One, to really dedicate a greatest hits package to one of the greatest R & B artists of all time, second probably to James Brown, you would need at least 3 or four CD's. (On an additional note, maybe Motown and Stevie could learn some lessons from Brown's 5-stars-is-not-enough Star Time box set.) The song selection also suspect, as many great early 60's selections and key album cuts are missing, including but not limited to Fingertips, Part 2, If You Really Love Me, Don't You Worry About A Thing and Happy Birthday. If anyone at Motown/Polygram/MCA whatever you call yourselves now is reading this, do Steveland, his music and his fans justice and get it right the next time."
2,"Songs in The Key of ""Overdone""","I am one of the biggest Stevie Wonder fans ever. I truly appreciate the way his musical genius has influenced almost every pop musician who has ever heard ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"". I can't help but think the man has done nothing significant since ""Musiquarium"", and that was a 'best of' collection. If he would only unplug the music sequencer and play his old Memory Moog again, maybe this generation of ""Urban Music"" retreads would start making songs that will last past the BET Top Ten Countdown. Enough ""Best Of's"", Stevie!"
1,big dissapointment! where is the funk?,"the problem with this collection is that it includes too much of stevies sappy overproduced garbage that he recorded in the eighties.it might as well be dion warwick!there was a time in the early to seventies when s.w.'s music had depth and groove,funk and energy,there is very little of that in this collection.this collection would be perfect for the dentist office!"
4,Its a tease,"If you are a avid Stevie Wonder fan like myself you would consider yourself disappointed by the way Song Review is put together. My biggest problem is the songs are randonmly put together. This being said its hard for fans to see his musical progression from the 60's, 70's and 80's. Also with any Greatest Hits collection some of his most groundbreaking work is missing such ""As"", ""Isn't she Lovely"" among my personal favorites. Yet the cd isn't all bad as you can hear the beautiful ballads and roaring funk that Stevie Wonder has protrayed all through his incredible career."
4,"Stevie gets 100 stars, CD gets 4","First off, let me just say that if I had all the money in the world, Stevie Wonder and Al Green would be singing at my wedding. I LOVE THEM. So, the fact that I gave this CD four stars has NOTHING to do with Mr. Wonder. If I hadn't said it before, I LOVE HIM. The only reason I gave it four stars was because ""Isn't She Lovely"" and ""Happy Birthday"" are not on it. Other than that, it's Stevie Wonder, people... BUY IT."
5,better than cold beer on hazy hot day,"this album definately deserves a look see, it is a bit subtler than keen's other albums, it has some slower songs, some craftier songs, the type of songs that keen gets noticed for above his voice. (one time i had this cd playing in the truck and my mom said ""whoever this is, he almost cant sing"") he is a master song writer who can weave a story with vibrant imagry and charecters who you just might know. favorite songs: jesse with the long hair, corpus christi bay, so i can take my rest, paint the town beige, well hell, all of them... this album for me invokes a feeling. its a good feeling."
5,Keen At His Best,"This is without doubt my favorite REK cd. Every song on the album is masterfully written and Keen's ability to tell a story is phenomenal. True to Keen's form, Bigger Piece of Sky's songs are filled with colorful characters yet boast a complexity rarely seen in modern country. Whenever Kindness Fails and Here in Arkansas are especially gripping. If you are unfamiliar with the artist and wish to hear him at his best, look no further - Bigger Piece of Sky is as good as it gets."
5,Fantastic CD... Hard to beat...,"This is one of my favorite CDs. Every song on it is consistently good. It was composed before the band lost Duckworth, so this is REK at his best! If you like country and are tired of the top-40 they play on country radio these days, try this."
1,nope,"Just the fact that it's not nails running down a chalkboard gives it one star. Plus, zero is not an option. The fact that he is an aggie makes it impossible to listen to, and I urge all Longhorns to bypass this in favor of any Jerry Jeff CD."
2,Polyester -- yuk! Graco should offer an organic cotton or supima cotton version,Too bad Graco only offers this in yucky polyester blend instead ofa 100 percent egyptian cotton or supima cotton. The sheet is coarse and not very soft for a newborn.
3,A sheet is a sheet,It fit. The color was neutral. The baby would never know one way or the other. My feelings about it are neutral
2,Not worth the price,This sheet is very thin and not a good quality material. I do not think it is worth the price at all. I made two sheets for less than the price I paid for this one. It does fit the Travel Cribs perfectly. It would be too small for the Pack N Play.
3,Not very soft,"The sheets fit nicely, but they are not very soft at all. They were also very see through. I wouldn't buy again."
4,Fit great,"Product fit great - note that this is for the travel crib, not the full size one. The sage color is kind of ugly. Looks like an army green."
1,Ripped before I could use it...,"Well I wish I could say how my daughter liked it or how it fit in our playard, but the thing ripped on a gentle cycle in the laundry (instructions followed), literally shredded...Complete piece of junk. Graco should be offering a better product than this to use in their playards. No excuse for this..."
2,It fits the Graco Travel Lite... BUT,"...I expected far better. This is a great space-saving, travel pack n play, but all that these 'sheets' are is an EXTREMELY thin pillowcase with the back ripped off. No, I'm not kidding... I opened the package and stared in disbelief. Honestly, after doing more research, it's better to just use a standard/queen sized pillowcase and tuck the ends under. Oh and don't even remotely expect these 'sheets' to contain a blowout or pee... it goes right through to the pad."
2,Pretty cheaply made,"This sheet is very thin and it seems like there should be a better option. My son has not had many accidents in his travel lite crib, so it has not really been put to the test although I doubt it would stand up for very long if it ever was. I have herd of others using pillow cases, they do fit, or also sewing their own. The best reason I can think to buy one of these is to use it as a template to make your own so that the pad will still be able to velcro into place (which, of course, it cannot do when you use a pillow case).The travel lite crib does not last long anyways for sleeping, only to 15 lbs for the bassinet portion."
2,Thin,"We purchased a Graco Travel Lite for a few upcoming overnight trips where space would be tight. At the same time, I bought two of these crib sheets. While I was very happy with the pack-n-play itself, the sheets were not satisfactory. They were thin and stiff, and have very little elastic. They do fit the mattress well, but they are not serving the purpose of providing a cool and comfortable covering to make my baby's sleep better. And since I bought two, for the same price, I could have purchased a set of two 600-thread count queen-sized pillowcases, that would have done a better job. I recommend doing that instead of buying these."
1,Description not accurate,"Specifications did not list the measurements of the sheet only the measurements of the packaging. The sheet did not fit my play yard, so the purchase was a waste. I will end up donating the sheet to the local womens shelter. For further reference, the sheet measures 20x30 inches and no depth measurement (totally flat fit). It does not have any elastic to help it fit. The play yard mat would need to be in a folded position to start it into the envelope type sheet. I think the fabric would be fine after a wash but I am donating it so cannot accurately state if it will."
2,Travel lite crib sheet arrived with a hole!,"The Travel Lite Crib sheet is a simple product that should not come with any problem, however I was amazed to receive one of them with a big hole on it. I could not find the way to write this info back to Amazon as they do not provide this option on the web. I had already wash it so I could not return it. I am not happy with the product"
1,What did you send me?,"Sheet did not fit. Was about 1/2 the size of the Graco Pack n play. Wrapping is gone. Would love to return, but don't know where and too busy enjoying my grandaughter to care. Don't buy this."
2,"An engaging story, but not application","Its a good read and a 'wow that happened' story, but I felt like it left me a little hanging as to how I could apply the author's experience to mine. I'm not sure if the author has really learned deep down biblical truths, but just shared that if our lives are this messed up, then you can 'make it' with yours too. But why 'make it' if you don't truely overcome and find the fruits of the spirt in the process?"
5,Encouraging Story,Julie honestly and openly shares her experiences with us and balances it with thought-provoking questions and biblical teaching. Those who have suddenly realized they went into marriage with some false expectations will be enlightened by her down-to-earth view of matrimony.
5,I LOVE JERRY'S MUSIC,"JERRY RIVERA HAS THE BEST SALSA MUSIC, I LOVE ALL HIS CDS THERES NOT A SONG YOU CAN'T LIKE. I GIVE JERRY A TEN."
2,"Good story, incorrect formatting",Kindle edition. Formatting errors throughout. Misspellings and codes / tags showing. Good Oppenheim fare from the early part of the decade before the great war.
5,A first rate read,"First, there was Evelyn Rawski and now there's Pamela Crossley. These two women are truly revamping Qing culture for the Western world.The story of the Manchus as seen thru 3 generations of bannermen.However, one of the earlier reviews was clearly horsing around - he has morphed Emperor Puyi to Piyu and also mentioned that Jinliang was Puyi's courtesan.Jinliang was a man!The reference to the Empress Dowager's interest in all things equus gives the game away."
4,point of fact,"While the review that twice mentions bestiality in the Qing court is questionable on many grounds--including priorities and historical analyses--decribing a male courtier as a courtesan is not one of those grounds. For thousands of years, Chinese emperors routinely had sexual relations with males, including their courtiers and officials. This was still common in the late Qing, and various sources attest that Puyi did not break with this tradition. Whether the gentleman mentioned in the review received these attentions from Puyi I don't know, but the suggestion is not absurd on its face. Nor is describing such a relationship with the term ""courtesan."" One could debate the merits of such a neologism, but one should not dismiss it out of hand.I wanted to say something to clarify this point that has been raised in two other reviews, but I will not myself review the book."
5,AWESOME WORKOUT,I've lost over 15 lbs so far and this workout is THE ONE! I've never been so encouraged and motivated!
3,NIce Workout,"I'm quite satisfied with these DVD's, they get a good start to a regular exercise routine! I like Jay's motivational slogans throughout the series, he's actually pretty funny, They're not super intense workouts but they still get the job done. I'd recommend them!"
1,Not a Reputable Company,I was given a copy of this workout by the President of TAB Fitness Media when I was considering doing some consulting work for this company. The workout is not bad but the company is not at all reputable. I was out of work and took consulting work with this company. I landed them a sweet distribution deal (which event netted them an advance)and created a placement plan for their upcoming DVD releases. The President kept telling me the check is in the mail until their new deal went through and then he stiffed me on what was owed me. He was so nice until the deal went through. He even went so far as to give me a tracking # for the supposed check he sent me. It was a bogus tracking number. I even charged them a very low fee for the work I did since I was just trying to get by while out of work. Don't support companies that would take advantage of people by purchasing their products! There are other good workout programs out there with reputable people backing them!
5,Hidden Gems,"An excellent Jesse Winchester album, with lots of hidden gems. Very popular when played on the radio."
4,Good and not great,"This is good reliable string for the string trimmer. It is pretty green so when it breaks off in the lawn, you can't see it...cool. It works and is priced right."
4,Not Flat on Flavor,"I was lucky enough to meet the authors, while living in Laramie, Wyoming. (We could smell something terrific cooking in the bookstore nextdoor and had to find out what it was!) They baked up several breads, and I had to have this amazing cookbook and cultural journey. Travel the world while remaining in your own kitchen.Authentic recipes of not only bread but many ethnic dishes, offering fabulous variety, proving that perhaps man could live on bread alone, if he had this cookbook."
4,Good introduction to simple breads and accompaniments,"Flatbreads & Flavors is an intriguing culinary travelogue of Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, South America with a little Europe and North America thrown in. The bread recipes though are quite American because of the measurements in cups and the commercial dry yeast. I don't believe that folks in the hinterlands are shopping at American grocery stores. More information on natural leavening and native approaches to measuring ingredients would be of more interest. The accompanying dishes are more credibly presented."
1,"some recipies good, others terrible","Alford and Duguid are great travel writers, but not good cooks...half the recipes fail, the dough is too sticky, too tough, too little for the stuffing that is supposed to go inside turnovers, etc...(I have been cooking for 25 years so I do know how to make dough)....be very careful following their recipies, sometimes you have to trust your instinct instead of the recipe"
2,"Interesting stories, bad recipes","This book is very interesting to read, you get a lot of background information on where certain types of bread are made and the people that make it. The authors seem to really enjoy meeting people and talking with them about food.That being said, I have made a number of the recipes in this book and none of them were good. I have a lot of bread cookbooks and I am a fairly experienced bread baker and just reading some of the ingredient ratios had me scratching my head. Sometimes the dough is too dry, sometimes too wet. The instructions become vague in crucial areas, such as describing the texture your dough should be at certain points or how things should look when they are done. The resulting products are often tough, tasteless and chewy. I even tried adjusting a few of the recipes and they just didn't taste very good, which is too bad, because the descriptions sound so nice."
3,"Good 'real' science fiction. Ship in space, crew, conflicts etc.","Although it got a bit odd towards the end, the whole book is interesting and is a good look at the problems faced in deep space by a crew on a military starship. The StarWolf books however are MUCH better."
1,don't buy this,It was not very comfortable. It didn't look the way I thought it would. I regret buying it
1,Unpleasant grab for attention and $$,"This book purports to be an ""affectionate memoir."" In reality, Russell paints an extremely unhappy picture of Katharine White's declining years. Russell entered the White household as Mrs. White's secretary, and while her account of Mrs. White's loosening grasp on reality is likely true (Mrs. White suffered from a number of serious health problems and was on countless medications) Russell's need to expose this story and to constantly portray herself as a victim leaves a very nasty aftertaste. The book ultimately says much more about Russell (almost all of it negative) than about either of the Whites.It should be mentioned that Russell adored E. B. White. Her perceptiveness concerning the White marriage, or any self-awareness, however, unfortunately seem to be nil."
3,Historical Mystery Weaved Full of God's Love,"Though the book is sometimes hard to follow due to its historical setting and language style, it is definitely worth the effort. As Belorba and her fiance' struggle to solve the mysteries of their ancestors' pasts in order to clear the way for a happy marriage, they cling to God's faithfulness and discover His loving, yet sovereign plan. Belorba's unique narrative style makes the reader feel like a present listener. The surprise ending neatly, and delightfully, ties up all loose ends."
3,"Appealing, if for not much else","What can one say about a giant banana costume which has not been said before? It was easy to slip on, and it wasn't very cumbersome throughout the day to wear. The crafting at the bottom of the costume leaves a bit to be desired; it flattened out and stayed that way, and at times it was hard to see that I was more than just some guy in a yellow tunic. Unlike the photo, the head is a detached hat, which breaks the flow a bit.But as a big guy, it's hard to find quality costumes, so this was about as good as it gets."
3,Why Women Worry,"Ordered this book for myself and for a girlfriend to read. It's a bit outdated. There are good guidelines, but I felt as though I already knew what the book suggested (journal-ing and tracking habits). Would not recommend as the book is too old for today's busy women lifestyle."
4,"Exciting Sophomore CD from the ""Flipper""","Tisdale's ""In The Zone"" offers a nice blend of true Funk, RB, and Jazz. This is a good disk for in the car, Partying whatever. Must have for any fan of the Bass."
4,Great!,"Nephew loved these! Everything I expected. I would love to see them in a more durable material because kids will drool, tear and rip but for the price they were great!"
3,"Miles is excellent, but this isn't his best","This isn't his best book, but that said, I've now read a number of other books by Barry Miles including Beat Hotel, Hippie, and his bios of Kerouac and Ginsburg. He's an excellent writer and very incisive. He's lived the history he's writing about, and I highly recommend his works. I especially like his very critical bio of Kerouac."
3,Discusses warts and all.,"Barry Miles gets trashed by other reviewers and some of the critiques are justified especially when you don't get Zappa's date of death correct. Nonetheless, Miles attempts to write a well-rounded biography that discusses warts and all. Some of it is disillusioning hearing the negatives about Frank, but it was always the things that you already suspected; such as Zappa being an absent father, a control freak or not wanting to pay his musicians. This book was better than Frank's own ""The Real Frank Zappa Book"" because it was trying to paint the whole picture. As far as how it ranks to other biographies of Frank Zappa, I couldn't comment since I haven't read any. The biography includes a discography section, which is also nice. It is nearly 400 pages, so it takes a bit of a time commitment."
2,Zappa Was Great. This Book is Not,"What a talent was Frank Zappa. How creative, how different, how inspired he was.This book?Not.Miles' lengthy work contains a million details about who and where and when. In the pursuit of the details, the author misses two big and important things: that Zappa's life had emotional highs and lows that should be (and can be) described in vivid, colorful detail; and that readers enjoy being entertained - not simply informed. There's very little in here to tell you just how Zappa was in his day to day life: his affectations, his mannerisms, the phrases he commonly used. Sure, we learn he chain-smoked Winstons. We learn he stayed at a different hotel than his bandmates when on tour. We learned he was cynical about his politics. But, come on. A human life is so much more complex. And rumor has it that Zappa was a funny sonofabitch. Gimme some of THAT."
1,Blah Blah Blah Oh Mothers wherefore art thou?,Nothing new here. Seemed as if the author complied this from other zappa books. Miles seems to think that 60's Mothers good/70's and beyond Zappa Bad. The impression given is if only Frank lived in New York everything would have been okay. Most irratating... he injects his opinion onto almost every page instead of finding actual quotes or doing interviews and letting other people make the statements. I enjoyed the McCartney book... this one is pretty lame. Don't buy it.
3,Any Zappa Is Good,"If you're a Zappa fan, which I surely qualify as, then any Zappa is good stuff. But, some is way better than others. Such is the case here. While this book reads very quickly, I couldn't actually determine if it was due to the writer's style or my knowledge of the subject. Either way it's enjoyable to dive back into some concentrated Zappa from time-to-time. The book doesn't offer any new solutions to the mystery of Zappa, but it does a decent job of cataloguing his successful career and life. Could anyone have done better? Maybe not.Not a must-read, rather an OK read."
2,Rock journalism as FZ described,"This sort of Albert Goldman-esque-kick-him-since-he's-gone putdown verifies Frank's perfect description of rock journalists which the author even quotes. Too much of this book is cheaply judgmental and ineptly critical. One can easily imagine Frank's cynical reaction to this deflated synopsis of his life's work. At one point, Miles states that Zappa was in great awe of the phony New York Art scene and was rather a big fish in a small pond by continuing to dwell in Los Angeles while deeply desiring to be an accepted member of this New York crowd. As his referenced stature as a much more noticed world class artist clearly refutes this, such silly confabulations are pointless and demonstrate the author's odd lack of appreciation for his subject."
4,Well researched but common knowledge for Zappa fans,"Hats off to Barry Miles for researching the details, but there is not much here that a Zappa fan doesn't already know. There are minor allusions to some of the myths and shortcomings of Zappa that were talked about while he was alive, but nothing that challenges the deification of Zappa by hard core fans.If you've read the other Zappa books, there are not many revelations here, but nevertheless it's Zappa."
1,Don't bother,"This reads like a boring college text. Full of ""facts"" and not much else. Except when Miles tears Zappa apart personally. I've been a Zappa fan for 35 years and had my own vision of what he was like. Unfortunatelly I read this book and won't be able to enjoy Zappa's music or memory as much as I did before. Thanks Miles."
2,Not too many surprises here,"""It's that the Emperor's not wearing any clothes, never has never will."" -- FZ according to MilesMusician, heal thyself?The man, whatever his defects, is gone. The book, with all its defects, will someday vanish, as will its author. The music is the important story. Listen."
2,Disapointing; you can safely skip this one,"Other reviewers have already dinged this book for its inacuracies, lack of original research, and opinionated conjecture. I agree whole-heartedly. I found the prose to be rambling, and the overall treatment to be superficial. The book focuses almost exclusively on Zappa the man, with very little about the music. In other words, don't expect to learn any new ""conceptual continuity"" clues. Even then. I knew most of what was in this already, which was probably the biggest let-down. I can't recommend this: it's the type of ""rock journalism"" Zappa himself railed against."
2,A cut and paste job,"The other reviewers have already said this in so many words, but the fault of this book is that there is nothing new in it. IT is a cut and paste job pure and simple. Even his opinions, such as that liberal comedians don't so much talk truth to power as they do mock their own liberal mores come from otherbooks. If you've read the other Zappa books and are well read generally you don't need to read this book -- you could have written it."
2,Unbelievably Sloppy,"This book had more glaring errors than perhaps any other I've ever read. Too many misspellings (inconsistent ones at that; sometimes the author gets it right, other times he doesn't, often in the same paragraph!) of crucial names and song titles, plus myriad typos and grammatical errors are greviously distracting; both the author and editors did an unbelievably sloppy, amatuerish job here.Precious little light is shed on the compliacted relationships he had with such central figures as Herb Cohen, Captain Beefheart, Ray Collins, Don Preston, Jimmy Carl Black, etc.Although the book offers a few fascinating insights into Zappa's history, character and relationships with family and fans, crucial analysis and discussion of classic Zappa/Mothers albums are given short shrift at the expense of his later, grandiose (and ultimately far less important) symphonic and computerized work.The definitive Zappa bio has yet to be written; avoid this second-rate book."
4,10 min of self-indulgent prog wankering!!,"I just picked this disc for cheap and am very happy. What a phenonenal band. The recording is a little muddy and not up to the quality of the ""Starland Ballroom"" or ""Last Supper"" live discs, but that is to be expected from a small show like this. The energy of the band is apparent and the audience is totally into the show.Its worth the price just for the closing extended version of ""Everything Evil"" with the talkbox solo and Claudio's comment ""This is what the British call '10 minutes of self-indulgent prog wankering. We are wankers!'"""
5,It's alright,"Comes in a weird case but its fine. For the 18$ i spent on it, it's good. If you are a hardcore fan like myself i just had to get it."
5,BUY THIS CD !!!,"hi my name is Karloz and i am a big fan of coheed and cambria.They are a realy great rock band and I think that it is worth spending your money on this cd.Make sure you check out ther other 2 cd's...they are called, second stage turbine blade , In keeping secrets of silent earth:3well thats all i gota say, PEACE..."
2,nice but...,i gave the miuchiz to my daugher as a christmas gift. great but after 8 days it's no longer working>
3,"boring toy, for downloading for nothing",Well it is fun but it keep kickin me off.And they don't have much games and you can't play the games on online.All that downloadin for just a little 20 dollar toy.I like tagothchis betta because they got more games to play and to know many to have one.Because only know 3 people have Miuchiz.I know 12 people have tamaiyghis.Anyway I know 7 people like bratz.
1,Big Headache!,"Save yourself a big headache. After my seven year old daughter was 'sold' by their TV ads, I bought one for her. The hand-held game works fine, but my daughter is bored of it (after 2 months). Each time she tries the online experience, however, I must sit in front of the PC and spend over an hour downloading/installing the latest version of the software, rebooting my PC, and trying to re-connect to their website (of course this is in the middle of when I am trying to cook dinner!). After updating the software, it asks me to update it again... I am sent into a circular loop and then it cannot even connect to ""Planet Mion."" I suspect they spent 99% of their budget on the ads, and 1% developing the product."
1,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs. We bought the Bratz one & it thought it was a Pawz when we took it online. After 10 or so total hours (Yes, I know what I'm doing) fighting it I gave up & took it back. Tech support is a joke. There's NOTHING in the manual or online help, only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time, and none of those responses addresses the issue."
1,Cool but I got a defective one,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it, but we cant seem to transfer the software onto the handheld game. The software that we downloaded keeps saying it dosent detect any device. We tried soooo many times and went through it step by step over and over. We made sure its fed/completly happy and in the computer room pressed the action button made sure she was connecting but when we clicked on the button for the software on our pc it just wouldnt work it doesnt recognize the device,its so wierd. My husband is a System Administrator and he tried everything and it just doesnt work. I emailed for help on the website and the just sent me a message of instructions that i already tried.....not very good help, soo i give up,I think we got a defective one, im returning that sucker..."
4,HEEEllPP,i have been looking at the miuchiz bratz and I think they are really awesome i want one for christmas. Which one is better cloe or jasmine?? do they really have different personalitiescan some one plz help me thnx
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I bought this for my 10 yr old and in order to hook it up to our computer we have to pull out the tower and locate the area which it connects to.(very hard)then if you have a firewall it wont conect to the internet. Even after disabling the firewall it did not want to connect. Emailed over 10 times to company for help and it was the same auto response each time, no help at all. Very disgusted with the game and would not recommend to anyone. What a waste of money."
1,poor satisfaction,"I bought two of those elecronics,none of those were working.My husband is a physician as well as my daughter.They both try to work with the above item,no luck.I returned the item to Amazon and hopefuly I get my money back.so far I have not recived the money.Dr Shahla Sadeghi"
3,Fun but too many bugs.,"My 6 year old loved the interactive aspects of her Cloe. She liked buying new clothes and playing the simple games on it. So she had her $15 worth of fun.I would not have paid more than that for it though.We had a horrible time trying to download patches and connect to the website,so we finally gave up on that idea.But the item would often have to be completely reset,as a programming glitch would not allow her to play video games if she was hungry,but she didn't have enough money to buy food. This happened several times,causing my daughter to lose all the ""stuff"" she had managed to accumulate. Maybe a lesson in spending smarter,but it wasn't done deliberately.Yasmin was even worse,the screen completely fritzed out after a couple days of play."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is a cheap electronic game and it shows. I didn't have any trouble downloading the required content from the web (I guess they've worked out the gliches now). However, I will admit that this entire concept is complicated and frustrating for a child's toy. It is a cute and fun temporary distraction for my four year-old daughter, but I don't imagine it being on the ""must have list"" for any child over 6. Overall it's a good idea for a toy, yet executed quite poorly."
1,Frustrating!!!,"The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!! and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!!I only gave it 1 star because the review process doesn't have a 0 stars.DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS THING!!!!!"
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This product is a waste of time! Don't bother. The handheld game is entertaining for my daughter, but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least! Once connected, we walked around the ""virtual world"" with nothing to do. It is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone. There are much better products out there for children that are similar, but easier to play with. I would suggest Webkinz or Neopets. These 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play, unlike the Muichiz site! Good luck..."
2,Breakable Bratz,I purchased this for my eight year old niece. We were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks. Be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer. The program takes up a lot of memory on your computer's hard drive.
1,awfull game,"its a cheap game. dont spend your money on this peice of useles junk.its fun for a couple of days, and then after that... BAM! its boring!parents dont spend your money on this junk. there is a cheap cheif,cheap chareters, and all it does is locks up.the whole topic isDONT SPEND YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I bought this game for my daughter for Christmas last year, thinking it would be a fun cheaper version of a gameboy. At first she didn't understand it, then once she got the hang of it, it quit working. Ended up tossing it. Do not waste your money. It's worthy about $3.00 instead of the $30 I paid for it."
2,Poor Quality,"This document tube is of inferior quality compared with some other products on the market. While the adjustable length feature is nice, the tube doesn't stay locked at the desired size and often the two halves completely separate. Tape is required at the joint to hold the two pieces together."
3,poster tube fair but not great,"This poster tube is essentially a cheaper version of better made telescoping tubes of similar length and diameter. The plastic wall is a bit flimsy (lighter weight), but the real problem is the mechanism for telescoping the tube out; it is based on friction between the two segments, resulting in a rather difficult adjustment that does not hold it's lengh well. I purchased another tube from Artarama that is superior in these specifics"
4,Good Document Tube!,"This tube is very good for the price. The fact that it extends from 2 feet to 3 is a really nice feature. It is also pretty durable, and is EXTREMELY helpful when it's raining."
4,Nice tube,I purchased this tube to carry my scientific posters. It is nice and has adjustable size but the only problem is that it does not lock well.
5,Super Duper product,"This is a must for everyone who wishes to carry a full size poster. Worry free, wrinkle free storage and great protection for data. Also has room for ID insert which makes your poster/data safe and secure. An awesome product."
2,misleading picture,The picture looks like it's a steel tube... however I was sent a black plastic tube. It was still a quality product with all the features I expected.
4,A good investment... if you know how to use it,"It can be a durable companion for your trips. It is not an indestructible tube, so don't throw it along with your luggage. However, it will survive careless traveler in the cabin (the ones who push their luggage in those small upper compartments). Mine did it! It will protect your valuable document from light, weather, and other risks of a long trip."
3,Too small for my poster!,"Works exactly as a poster tube should, BUT is too small for the posters we print off for conferences at WVU. This means it has to be duck taped together, which means it occasionally opens up, scattering your papers and posters so that you have to run down Newbury St. in Boston, dodging pedestrians and cyclists to retrieve your ""oh so important"" poster and handouts. Yikes."
5,Perfect for trade show posters or large documents,I needed to carry some posters up to a trade show and this tube was perfect! Fit into the overhead and I avoided the hassle of shipping it home after the show.
4,Conferencing Poster Transport,"Thank you, The product served its purpose well and I was able to be confident that contents were well protected."
4,Good Value,"Used mine while also collecting posters at the San Diego Comic-con. Very sturdy and love the fact that it's a telescoping tube. The notches will not fully lock into place when size is adjusted to you have to be careful with that feature...it can easily get bumped, shift and crush any longer posters inside. But I had no issues with it while walking around the convention or transporting it in the overhead bin of an aircraft. And obviously, it's perfect for storage. Likely the best document tube for travel for the money on Amazon."
1,Broken DVDs Ruin great show,Pirates of Dark Water was one of my beloved childhood memories. I jumped at a chance to own the entire series on DVD to see if this show has stood the test of time.Unfortunately the DVDs are unwatchable. The First Disc is stuck playing an infinite loop of the anti-piracy message and the few episodes that can be watched are jumpy and glitched.I am very disappointed that this entire set is unwatchable. I do not know how a professional Media company can produce and ship a product this far gone. 10 seconds of quality control could have prevented this.DO NOT BUY.
4,Old Classic that was ahead of its time.,"This was a great series. Every time I watched it I thought ""Wow"". I was talking to a buddy not long ago who remembered it and said he missed it. SO, what a better gift to give."
2,80's cartoon ok,"pirates of darkwater is an ok cartoon, i remember thinking that it was cool, but i think back then the cartoon was only for its time. most cartoons from the 80's still have good graphics but the older you get the story lines just seem to get cheesier and cheesier."
1,Pretty Bad,But Sigourney Weaver actually looks hot in this movie....but good grief it is lame lame lame.Did I tell you it was Lame?
1,DID NOT WORK ON STREAMING,I love the film and ended up going to Blockbuster to rent it. I was unable to stream it. I've emailed Amazon about this but I haven't heard back. I hope I can get a refund (even if it's just a few dollars) because I got nothing from it.
5,Great Ideas for the Classroom,"I teach a 3rd and 4th grade split. This book is filled with great ideas to get the students writing step by step. They want to write because the topics are personal. After a few lessons, my students are now able to write 5 paragraph essays on their own with all the elements. It worked for me!!"
4,Subbing Observation,"I was in a classroom substituting, and saw some of the activities from this book being used. The kidswere motivated! I ordered the book for my own use! Some of the activities can be used as journal writing/time or fillers."
1,"Too Little, Too Late","Very simple approach to preparing for writing assessment. 10 lessons? I'm sorry, bur ten lessons can do very little to make a difference."
2,Different Book,"I ordered the ""Ultimate White Pages Guitar Vol. 1"", which is what the seller called it. However, I received the ""Greater Guitar White Pages"", which is completely different. The seller falsely advertised and I hope to get my money back."
5,Excellent,"Before I got this book, I did a lot of research to figure out which technical analysis book would be best and after reading this one, I was not disappointed in the least. I've read a number of books on technical analysis (I'm largely self taught) and this one is by far the best I've ever read. It explains everything clearly and provides evidence and analysis of just about everything. The way that it explains how each indicator/tool was developed along with it's relatives is also very useful and interesting. I strongly recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in technical analysis."
5,top 3 technical analysis books,"Great book,from the first page to the last,if you are serious about learning technical analysis there is no better way to start than this exceptional book,it takes you from the history of technical analysis,to the basics,principles,different techniques,charting,,,...it is a complete source of information"
5,complete TA Book,"The most complete book in TA,everything prepared carefully ,so clear charts , clear explanation , it is useful for both beginners and professional ,it is ""The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians ""fahadwww.GreatSignal.com"
5,The Benchmark for all other Technical Analysis textbooks,"This will be a short review. If you have any desire to learn more about Technical Analysis, every aspect, from zero level to advanced. This is the only book you need. I trade actively and this book is always within reach. 95% of all financial investment books are crap, picking your pocket, this book is worth the price. We refer to it as the bible in my trading firm. Fear not."
3,Reasonable Book,"This is basically a compilation of many books. At at leastone place, there seens to be a contradiction. That is thedanger of compiling. Overall, it is still a reasonable book.Contrary to what a reader wrote, the index of a book isimportant."
2,good theories but not to make money,this book contain good theories for technical analysis but I found those theories failed to be implemented in emerging market.
4,Excellent Find,"This is an excellent historical fiction novel. I was able to find, buy and enjoy this book quickly using Amzon.com"
2,Kaspar - sometimes being different is not a good thing,"This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. It is a mess of nonsensical sentences! I get it, Kaspar is learning how to speak after being locked up for 16 years (just read an autobiography about the man, there are plenty around)! But Handke beats the point to death (along with many other lines). The story moves so slow (development is slow, granted he's been locked for years, but lets get the story flowing a little quicker!) The story is all over the place and the way the book is set up annoys me to no end. Handke seems like someone who would confuse you with obscure pretentious remarks to prove he is a genius when in reality, hes just a normal person with a few quirks. This has all the pretentions of the art world in writing form.In closing, there is a reason nothing like this has been done before or since, it simply does not work!"
5,Fantastic Book,I vote this book one of the greatest books ever written. If your mind can handle this information that is.
1,Junk food for the gullible!,"Okay I admit I bought this book simply because it said The Keys to Enoch and I didn't bother reading the reviews or finding out about the author. Anyway the book is religious junk food. It celebrates irrationality and fantasy without any word of evidence or facts. Yes it's a book about esoteric 'knowledge' (if you can call it that) but anyone can sit down and write trash, stick an Enoch label on it and sell it to the gullible. Don't waste your money on this trash - buy some beer and read a fantasy novel . . . it'll be much more rewarding! And by the way, the illustrations are amateurish and stupid"
4,The best in the series,"I thought that this was the best of the three in Piel's futuristic series. Arnoth was a great hero- handsome, intelligent, kind and sexy! Despite the pain of his past, he was able to find love with Sierra, who I thought was great. She was open, innocent, brave and even clumsy. Defintely someone that Arnoth needed to bring love into his life. What I really enjoyed the most about this book was the growth between the characters. The plot, action and alien worlds the author creates were just as intriguing. It is rare to find a good futuristic book out there and I am glad I had the opportunity to read Piel's futuristic series. Read them!"
2,"Too much slapstick, too little believability","This futuristic lacks believability in a big way. The cloning science makes little sense. The heroine was supposed to be a skilled operative, but she was a klutz. And the action is often contrived.This is one of those books where the humor comes from the supposedly capable heroine keeps bungling things, nearly getting people killed. The hero rolls his eyes and grips, but puts up with it. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love this book.If you haven't read the earlier books in the series, you'll have a lot of catching up to do. There is a lot of background necessary to understanding this plot.I didn't care much for the secondary characters who showed up near the end of the book. The best secondary character was a small, sentient bat who talked too much. The human characters couldn't compete with that!I gave this book a D-"
4,A Melodic First Novel,"The Distance in the title refers to sailing from the island, where the professor and his dead wife shared life, and the town across the bay. Also the new relationship is the distance between him, the older man, and the new romance with a young photographer. Can he accept love again and new interests? A melodic first novel telling of love that is beautiful the second time around. The author's treatment of the dead first love brings tears. Nature in Maine on the ocean is described through the eyes of his new young love, the photographer, Ellen."
3,"RV Designer Collection Cam 2"" F/T and left handle lock",I received this item in an expedient manner. This item was a perfect fit and the instructions was easy to follow making the installation of this item a snap. I will purchase items from this vendor again.
1,"2"" Cam for L Locking Handle","RV Designer Collection L661 2"" Cam F/T and L handle Lock, (see at [...])I installed four of the The locking L handle and found them to be of a good quality (National Mfg. N280636 Universal Locking L-Handle With Key. It was the 2"" catch, which I ordered 4 each, one for each L locking handle. They were $5.77 ea. After installing them, I could close the drawer, turn the handle into the locked position, but when I pulled on the drawer, to test the strength of the ""catch"" - they were easily bent. I found them so weak as to be ineffective.Gene"
3,"Very Short 2""","Ordered it and didn't read enough, I needed 3"" ones. These are only 2"" wouldn't work on my Camper shell, topper."
5,Love the ring,Bought this ring for my daughter at Christmas. She loves the ring. Beautiful design. Made strong with a delicate look.
3,Cute But Lacks Substance,"This is a nice pinky ring, but overall rather on the tiny side for any other finger."
4,Pretty,"This is a very pretty ring. It is a bit dainty for what I want, but I recieve many complements on it."
4,Cute!,"The ring is very cute...flat across the top, the gem does not come above the setting but still a nice everyday ring if you are into celtic jewelry!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"The stone is very pretty, but its smaller then i thought it would be. The metal looks and is cheap, the silver 'paint' on it is already chipping off. Over all I was not impressed with this ring, it looks cheap but I guess you get what you pay for right? I would not recomend it to anyone looking for something that looks expensive."
2,plated,"it didnt say when i purchased it that it was plated, but it still looks nice. wish it would been in the description"
4,Sterling silver ring,"Fit well. It looked great for the price I paid. It was what I thought it would be, so I was happy with the ring."
5,Loved it!,I loved this item. I bought it for myself for Christmas and I like Irish/Celtic jewelry and green stones.
2,A bit disappointed,Personally I was a bit disappointed with the ring. The stone is very small and looks nowhere near as bright or sparkling at this photo indicates.
5,Great Deal. Definatley get it,"Gave this as a little gift to my sister, looked excellent (if not a bit small). Overall a great purchase."
1,Do ur self a favor and save ur few bucks!,"Its cheaply made, I have a kennel and a crate it wouldn't latch on to either of them, it kept falling over! The latches are made too small and not sturdy enough. plus its super small... its sized for your pet hamster maybe, but not your dog!"
1,ZERO stars if possible!,"What the frick is this piece of junk good for??? Watering a cat? Purchased this for my GIANT petmate kennel and literally frowned and let out a grunt when I opened up the package! This thing is only 2.5""x6""! My dogs tongue is bigger than one of the compartments. PIECE OF C-R-A-P!!!"
2,"Satisfies Air Travel Regulations, Not Thirst","This cheap piece of plastic falls off the kennel door at the first bump. If your pet is going on a short flight and you need to satisfy the travel requirement, this will do. If you have any concern that your pet may become dehydrated, either keep shopping of break out the gaffers tape and bailing wire."
3,Does The Job,"Yeah, it's cheap, and not that well-made. But, it will satisfy the airline for your pet's requirements. It doesn't hold much, but, then again, it appears the airline didn't even bother to feed my dog on his 9 hour flight, even though I provided the food and water on top of the cage. Oh well. He chewed it up pretty good after the plane ride.If you don't fly your pet often, this is a good, cheap way to fulfill the food dish requirements."
3,You get what you pay for,"I got this to comply with airline regulations that my cat had to have a water bowl attached to the door. It does clip on to the door, but as others have noted, it is not very sturdy but can be secured with zip ties. The plastic feels very flimsy and cheap. However, for an item I only planned to use once while transporting my cat, it was good for the price. I would NOT use this daily for an animal that is kennel trained (for that, spend a few more bucks and get a better product)."
2,crate feeding bowl,"I found the size was perfect for my dachshund, but the plastic hooks that connect the bowl to the kennel are too tiny and flimsy causing it to fall down sometimes spilling the contents."
1,Not Recommended,"I purchased this for my 6mo old MinPin while I was at work - she gets separation anxiety and will destroy everything when someone goes outside for even a split second.It did not even last 1 day, her normal thrashing around in her crate broke the cheap plastic in half and snapped it right off the cage.If you have a low energy, elderly pup this may last you a week, otherwise it won't last an hour."
1,this cup is awful,"I recently purchased this cup and did read reviews before my purchase. The cup did when I tried to place it in the crate it would not fit over the bars in the crate to hold it in place. It is very cheap and of poor quality and I would not recommend to anyone. Spend a little extra and get something that you will be able to use. I am going to be sending these ones back, they do not work at all. I have a standard size cat crate that they should easily fit in."
4,brill,"this book was magical,a funny account of a new super-poet who a blackmailing reporter falls for. in my opinion this book should be read."
3,an early and relatively weak effort by Atwood..,"""Lady Oracle"" has many elements found in Margaret Atwood's later, and better, novels. We have a woman reminiscing about her rotten childhood, especially in dealing with bullying female classmates, as in Atwood's ""Cat's Eye"". This same woman is also a writer who blurs her fiction with her own life, as in Atwood's ""Blind Assassin"". In truth I sensed ""Lady Oracle"" to be in some sense autobiographical, with the author working through her personal complex issues and expressing them in prose ... and not very successfully.Oh, there is a story. Woman writer fakes her death and escapes to Italy. She then recounts her entire life, husbands and affairs and all. It all has a 1960s trashy soap opera feel about it. Unlike other amazon.com reviewers I didn't find this book particularly humorous, although the prose itself is quite clever ... Atwood's most notable trademark.Bottom line: disappointing and entirely forgettable. Not recommended."
5,Great Book,"I have been working in this book for around a year. I started it to help me learn to read drum notation in a format that would not be boring. The book, and practice, have moved me to levels I could not imagine at the beginning of the journey. The other day I finally ""heard"" what I saw. Great book- get it."
4,"Uneven, but worth getting if you like Bjork","The song Greece is amazing, and I'm also partial to a few others, like France. This band is like a gothic version of the Sugarcubes."
4,"Dark, dissonant and poppy-- fabulous.","Bjork is quite young with Kukl, and affects a strangely frightened sound on Holidays in Europe. Einar's shrieking makes sense in this format. A great LP that I have on vinyl only (sought it out for $35 at a record fair years ago) but the CD should be excellent and bring more of the bizarreness of this LP forward... Tres fab.Did I really just review a CD. Puh-leese!."
3,"Okay, but not great.","I am a huge fan of Bjork, and I'll buy anything she has been involved with. I am also a big fan of the Sugarcubes, but I have to admit that Kukl is not really my bag. To me it takes a lot to listen to this album. It's not really a pleasure to listen to. However, some of the songs are decent."
3,Only If You Are A Bjork Fan,I'm only reason I'm giving this album 3 stars is because of Bjork. I find the lyrics to be compelling and Bjork's vocals are mezmerising and haunting. The musicians don't sound like they are playing as a group. It sounds like a cacophony in someone's garage. I say buy it and put it with your Bjork collection.
5,Deranged...in that fantastic sort of way.,"A truly amazing album, ""Holidays in Europe"" is pre-Sugarcubes Bjork with Einar and a few other friends making some of the most original, most amazing music I've ever heard. I own both the LP and CD, but the CD lacks a tracklist (although both have the same tracklist). Anti-government, anti-Christianity and anti- a few other things show up in this album, which is more political than Kukl's 'The Eye.' A favorite of mine is ""The Man On The Cross,"" a song that has a hell of a lot to say. If you're looking for something the than the usual..try this.(Kukl is better than the 'Cubes, in my opinion)"
2,These used to be my favorite!,"I used to love these bagel crisps, they were consistantly tasty with good texture. Something has changed for the worse. They are no longer shaped like bagels, which isn't that big of a deal but the last bag I bought was at least 1/4 burned and very unevenly seasoned. If you like the taste of salty burned toast, by all means buy these bagel crisps."
1,Missing the old recipe,"These were once my go-to snack, now they are disgusting. They are indeed totally burnt not to mention so thin, they end up pulverized crumbs in a bag instead of the thick, simply salted, bagel toasts they used to be. These little wafers could not withstand the crappiest of dips, let alone a cream cheese-loaded knife. I wouldn't buy them if I were you."
3,"A textbook, not a report on the campaign","This was written before the 2004 campaign as a guide for following the campaign, and does not include info re: the campaign itself. As such, it's rather dry but useful for a hard-care politics junkie."
5,The Road to the White House,This was a very informative book. It helped me understand a bit more of was goes on to get to Pennsylvania Ave. I'm glad my professor recommended it to me!
4,LOUD fan inside. Not recommended for the computer desk.,Very loud fan inside. My ears are not particularly sensitive. It sounds like an old style blower fan in a computer. Hopefully I can modify it with a quieter fan. The fan seems to kick on randomly. I'd guess probably in the range of 60+ dB to possibly 100 or more. It really is that loud. Looks and works beautifully though. Great price point but I wouldn't but it again for the noise.
2,Not worth it.,"The book does use chocolate bars to model the use of arrays for multiplication. However, the concept is clouded by the tangental reference to different artistic styles used to write the numbers. At times I thought I was reading an art book instead of a math book. The additional information detracts rather than enhances the concept of multiplication. There are better texts than this one to help with multiplication."
1,Not nearly as good as the fractions version...,"I have to wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers...to be fair the multiplication information that *is* contained in this book are useful and some of the pictures using the chocolate bar can help students. However, the art references by far overshadow the math lesson and as I was reading it, I found myself distracted and confused...and I'm an adult!The hershey's fractions book is much better than this one. I thought I'd get the set and now I'm glad I didn't--this one is worth skipping over."
1,Poor Condition,I was very disappointed in the condition of the book. The book worked fine for what I wanted it for but I had to clean it up before I could use it. There was food stuff all over it. The pages were not only dirty but roughed up on the edges. I felt like I paid too much for the condition it was in.
1,Unhappy,This is a very poor put together. Not worthy of consideration. Doing a disservice to ragtime music.
3,A good selection,"Like all of Jumpin' Jim Beloff's uke books, this one delivers a good selection of tunes with well-chosen chords. There's a bit of overlap with his other books- I think this is the third of his books I bought that has ""Over the Rainbow""- but for a beginner with a taste for these old tunes it's a good choice. With 32 tunes, it comes to less than half a buck per tune- not bad."
5,"A comprehensive biography which includes critical commentary on his novels, short stories, nonfiction and other works","John Steinbeck is not only the most beloved of American authors - he's one of the most studied, so Critical Companion To John Steinbeck: A Literary Reference To His Life And Work will find many student readers; from high school to college. Here's a comprehensive biography which includes critical commentary on his novels, short stories, nonfiction and other works, discussing major themes, characters, film adaptations, and more. The blend of biography and critical reviews of all of Steinbeck's works provides students with all the background they need, handily under one cover."
2,For RAID beginners that don't want to dig too deep,"I was pretty diappointed by the content of that book.The graphs and the explanations on what is RAID are nice, but there are only a few lines about what to do if something goes wrong, which is the kind of situation you would like to have a strong reference on how to save your data.I would rate this book as ok for beginners, but when you want to know more, you don't have much help, so a bad mark for advanced users.I expected a more advanced work like on the O'Reilly book 'Using Samba' which is very nice, especially the Troubleshooting section."
2,Will need Google if you want to recover from disk failure,I have to echo Lamar Thomas's review -- there is precious little on how to recover from a failed drive. You will have to go back to Google to learn how to recover from a single failed disk if using software raid to provide redundancy for your data. Having a paper reference for various types of disk recovery (in the case of not having a readily available web browser at the same site as the raid server machine) was the main reason I bought this book. So I was quite disappointed. Most of the book's material on hardware raid controllers is dated and by nature vendor specific. Moreover much of the material on creation of software raid that this book provides is unnecessary if one creates the raid partitions at installation.
2,Not so great.,"I've been in the RAID business (OEM) for about 6 years, this book has some errors, and bad logic. It may be OK if you are in it as a hobbyist. In the sample chapter he talks about setting up a 480 MB/sec SCSI 160 raid card for a web server. For that application, a simple hardware raid card, would work better, and have lower CPU overhead. On the higher end, where is the talk of fibre channel, drivers and stability? I'd skip this book - look for Designing Storage Area Networks: A Practical Reference for Implementing Fibre Channel SANs, Blueprints for High Availability: Designing Resilient Distributed Systems, and read on the net."
5,Excellent book!,"Jerry Pallotta came to my first-grade son's school to talk and my son LOVED him. We have a couple of his board books and I ordered the Skull book in advance. It is amazing, the drawings are so detailed and it really incorporates critical thinking. I like how the pictures of the presidents are hidden too, it adds more fun to the book. I even learned a few things."
4,great show,This is a great episode. Original story line and great acting - Love the outcome. Matt Passmore is so handsome!
4,The Glades brings a new type of Cop show to TV,Having only seen The Glades Season 1 briefly on Australian TV I was pleasantly surprised particularly when I heard there was a Season 2 and 3. The characters on this show have a great chemistry and Matt Passmore shows that although Jim Longworth is great at solving crime he has a vulnerable side when it comes to romance. He also portrays irreverance when it comes to solving murders. I hope this show continues for some years to come.
4,The Glades #1,I was able to see the episodes that I missed that season. The disks were packaged well and came quickly. Will probably repeat for season #2
4,Good new Cop Shop...,"We thoroughly enjoyed this 1st season.Matt Passmore, an Aussie, does a great job leading the cast ensemble - he's refreshing, funny, self-deprecating and loves getting bad guys which is always important in a cop show.Always enjoy Florida-based shows - just the locale adds a degree of steaminess to it.Worth a look especially if you want to see a fresh new face.Looking forward to a longer Season 2."
3,Pretty good show,"I haven't watched TV since 2007 and only watch DVD's. I have to go by product description (for anything new) and this sounded pretty good. It's not a bad show. Although I could do without the bad language and showing people retching. (That's not entertaining to me and I want to be entertained.) The main character talks a little too fast so I have to back up the subtitles to see what was said. But overall it isn't too bad a show. I enjoy the 2 main characters (Jim and the Medical Examiner). Good chemistry and good for a few laughs in between the drama. Sorry to say that for me, personally, it isn't anything to get overly excited about but it's not too bad a show. I will more than likely buy the second season. It was entertaining enough. I would probably rate it at least 3 1/2 stars, almost to 4 stars."
5,Another Great CSI type show,"This is a really great show. I enjoy Bones, Castle, and Psych. Not a fan of CSI and NCIS but I really like this series. I think it is because it has an unconventional person doing the police work. Interesting twist in the pilot and decent plot lines and plot twists through out the season. Story line continues in the second season, and still just as good."
4,Great,It is one of the better detective stories out there today. It has great stories with new thrills form episode to episode yet it maintains a running story too.
2,"Like new, not","All the disc's skip on ever episode, first time I bought something that wasn't actually new. Very annoying and disappointing."
1,Avoiding Malpractice 10 rules 5 systems 20 cases,This book is only 80 pages and offers suggestions about avoiding malpractice using 20 briefly described cases for purposes of illustration.This book is fairly elementary and offers little unique insight.For such a book I found the cost listed on the book($35.00)incredibly high.
3,"Upliftting, light Christmas Music","The MoJazz Christmas album is a collection of warm and uplifting Christmas songs. The album is not too overdone in the ""new age"" style jazz and the feel of the album is one of an intimate club setting. Tracks that stand out are Have `Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' by Wayman Tisdale (former power forward in the NBA), and the classic `Charlie Brown Christmas Song' as played by accomplished guitarist Norman Brown. For a contemporary, uplifting addition to your holiday music collection, MoJazz Christmas is a good pick."
3,pacific-northwest based historical novel,"All the idiosyncracies of this novel blend in with the swirl of crazy life in early twentieth century Seattle and a logging camp in western Washington. Cordy, an albino Chinese-American, falls hard for Squirl, a logger. She follows him to Seattle where life is completely different than in the logging camp. Populated with offbeat characters, this book moves rapidly along. Unfortunately, the characters develop either one-dimensionally or not at all. Cordy's new understanding of life at the end of the novel doesn't jibe with her growth throughout the book. However, this is a very good read for the flavor of Seattle as a growing, but still frontier-like town."
1,More information needed for purchase!,"In order to buy this item I would need to know the size of the hole I would need to bore in my table,also if I would need to countersink a lip on that hole ,and what the depth of that lip would be! That would tell me what kind of material I could use for the router table top ,or if this would work in my exsisting top.Also is one of the insert disks sized for template adapters?Is one avalable,is a blank disk available so I could bore one out to the right size. Otherwise it would be pretty much useless!!It looks like this product is very well thought out so maybe they have addressed all these issues when they designed it,we just aren't given the information! Give it to us please!"
1,good writer; bad book,"What a disappointment. This novel apparently couldn't care less about plot or character consistency. If you insist on buying this book, skip the entire Seattle episode because it has nothing to do with anything else. In fact, read the first two or three chapters and the last one and save an extraordinary amount of time (in others words, don't spend more than twenty minutes on it).I didn't read the first novel and, sorry, I shouldn't have to. It's insulting to a reader to just throw in some characters from a previous novel for no reason other than to make it appear you're writing a grand multi-book epic. Three-quarters of the way through the novel, the point of view shifts to second person several times (that's so eighties)...Jefferson has good writing skills. She needs to learn how to apply them to the novel form. This book reads like a first draft that never got revised. I stayed with it because it was on recommend and I kept thinking it would actually get better. Alas, no."
4,Wounds,Loved the book. This was not the same Buffy material that has made its way into vampire literature in the last few years.
3,If your a fan of Vampire fiction...,"I had purchased Jemiah Jefferson's first novel, ""Voices in the Blood""..but, after reading a few pages into it, just couldn't get interested...however, after reading ""Wounds"" I plan to go back and give the first book another try.If your a fan of Vampire fiction, like I am, this book will most definately appeal to you.The story of, basically, two misfits trying to maintain a relationship is enjoyable.My only complaint with the book is that the story's pacing could have been a bit better, it really begins to 'drag', around the last few chapters.All-In-All, it's a good read, the characters are enjoyable and you care what happens to them, which is the hallmark, to me, of what seperates a good novel, from a bad one.There is also plenty of sex and violence, for anyone that requires that in their reading material! ;)"
1,...The star speaks for itself.,"In my opinion this book was poorly written and poorly planned. andJemiah Jerfferson has room to grown in her career if you call it one.In the first few chapters of the book all is going well, and thestory is leading you somewhere interesting, until he goes into a cluband meets sybil, he cant read her mindand becomes infatuated with her. In the end she convinces him to puton a 'Big Show' and she chops his head off as a part of it.This book did have potential but she screwed it up.From what I have seen either you love this book or you hate it"
3,SILLY BUT SEXY.,"This is Vampire/Goth/Drugs/Sex...fiction novel. This book is just for fun and it's an easy read....not something to be taken too seriosuly. Allthough this is not a great book...it must not be that bad beacause years later I still remember the story. BTW, the authour of this book is a sexy black (maybe creol..can't tell) goth babe. >:)"
2,Blah,"This book was little more than annoying. I was so excited to read Wounds. I picked it up the second I shut Voice of the Blood. Wow...what a disappointment. I couldnt wait to get more of Daniel after meeting him in VOTB. The book really seemed like it might be excitng, but then Sybil comes along and the entire thing just falls flat on its face. What a pig she was. Every scene she was in I couldnt decide who I wanted to slap more...Daniel for putting up with her, or Sybil just for being there...ugh. Still, I cant stop here. I will for sure read Fiend and hope for the best...I only pray that the next book doesnt end so ridiculously."
4,Very very good.,"I read Jemiah's first book and enjoyed it immensely. I was, at first, disappointed that Ariane from the early work, was not the focus of this one. Instead, we have Daniel, bratboy batboy vampire. He reminds me of Daniel Ash from Love and Rockets and Bauhaus fame. Maybe Jemiah was thinking of him when she wrote the character.The new book is better than the old one. It lags a little in the middle, but that's because its so strong in character. You know these people, or you'll want to.Good job jemiah!"
3,If it wasn't glenn.....,"All I have to say....I was really let down, Though I really enjoy The coldest sun, and the last 2 minutes of Without light, I am....I think this record could have been much more solid....I love everything that Glenn has done....I even Find myself enjoying blackacidevil....like no one else seems to be able to do......However this record though when strong....VERY strong....the bad out ways the good.....But if you are a danzig fan....I recommend buying it....simply because....He's danzig"
1,Glenn better find Rick Rubin's phone number quick.,"To all of you who gave this steaming, satanic horsepile five stars-WAKE UP!!! As a major fan of all of Glenn's endeavors, I say its time to stop the madness. Everything from the design of the cover art, to the sound of the backing band, to the total lack of imagination in the writing of the lyrics say ""I'm burnt out"". Song titles like ""Kiss the Skull"" don't help either.Where did Glenn get these third rate musicians? They look like Limp Bizkit impersonators and sound like Vixen.The simple explanation could be the Glenn has befallen the same fate as George Lucas. Too much talent, not enough humility. Once an artist gains success within a group he thinks it's all him. The truth is that any good commercial artist bounces ideas off their crew. When you don't you get things like Jar-Jar Binks and ""I Luciferi ""My advice to Glenn is to kiss and make up with John, Chuck and Eerie and to get Rick Rubin back on the speed dial. Good luck man."
1,its hard..........,"It's hard to appreciate Danzig anymore since his voice is shot, this cd proved it, I miss the old days................."
5,Heavier!,Danzig is an amazing artist and keeps getting better and heavier with time unlike so many other bands who betray their sound.
3,Coming Full Circle,"This is one of Glenn's better works as of late, but personally I wish you could hear his voice more instead of noise. However, these tracks will probably sound a lot better live. Danzig is coming full circle he has tried several different genres of sound and this one is bringing him back closer to what he used to be. Danzig 8, which is in the making, apparently returns to his old melodic voice with an early Sabbathish guitar sound"
3,Danzig 7 lose the cover. creepier. Ok Cd.,"I know before I get slammed, this is danzig were talking about? My favorite songs Angel Blake,Kiss the Skulls,Wicked Pussycat, Cover is better, Inside better with Hotchicks, not into S&M myself, nor the name of the album but its unapologetic, it's danzig, All new lineup(every time, since danzig 4/5)"
3,What's Wrong With Glenn?!,"Glenn Danzig has been my personal hero for nearly twenty years, and I have to say that if this album were the first exposure that I ever had to him, he wouldn't be as tremendous to me.Danzig's voice is always what has really set him apart from other performers and songwriters, but this album is similar to the last two in the fact that his vocals are washed out and subdued. Where are those pipes, Glenn?! The music also is so washed with almost no breathing room, that I keep missing the heavy bass driven Danzig songs from the first four albums.So I would recommend this album, but it is not en example of what I really love about Glenn Danzig's work. Also, the photos of Glenn and the band that come with this album are just downright silly. I would much rather look at Glenn's evil artwork that he used to have for Misfits and Samhain stuff than Glenn threatening some teenage girl with a plastic black claw-glove thing."
5,This Is The Man who will take your breath AWAY !,"I CANNOT SAY IT ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Glenn Danzig is SO Talented that It makes me mad because NO ONE Gives HIM ANY CREDIT! I know its Soon, He Will DESTROY ALL~He is Hot * He lyrics KICK ASS. And everything else He does..WWW.THE7thhouse.com~ He will blow your freaking mind..."
1,"here lies Danzig's Music, 1977-1994","When Blackacidevil came out i was very dissapointed...and then came 6:66 devils child...which i thought was perhaps a slight comeback for him but not quite what i anticipated.....and now ""I Luciferi"" which has got to be the worst possible work to date. The raspy whispering in ""dead Inside"" and the lack of strong vocals and lyrics in ""The Coldest sun""...lets just say that Glenn's prime days are over and the voice and music we once knew and loved left with the old crew, producer Rick Ruben and American records. Tears of Blood...i cry."
4,ABOUT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I SEE EVERY ONE ELSE HAS GIVEN THIS ALBUM 5 STARS SO FAR.I TO WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS BUT DANZIGS VOICE JUST AINT WHAT IT USED TO BE.IT DONT HAVE THE POWER IT ONCE HAD,NOR THE DEEPNESS-ITS MORE SOFT NOWDAYS.HIS VOICE (LIKE ON SATANS CHILD)SOUNDS VERY TIRED AND STRAINED AND LIKE THE PREVIOUS ALBUMS (5 AND 6)HIS VOICE IS KINDA LOST IN THE GUITAR DISTORTION-ITS SOUNDS LIKE HES SINGING IN THE BACKROUND RATHER THAN UP FRONT LIKE ON 1-4.BEFORE THIS RECORD CAME OUT PEOPLE WERE SAYING IT SOUDED LIKE THE OLD DANZIG BUT TO ME ITS SOUNDS JUST LIKE SATANS CHILD."
2,not as horrible as the most recent live offering but...,"As much as I love and respect Glenn... this release left me a bit flat... W/ the release of Danzig 666: Satan's Child, Danzig seemed to back on track, but then they released the very disappointing Live on the Black Hand Side. Now, w/ 777 I Luciferi, Glenn seems to have lost ground again. Here's a man w/ a tremendous voice and writing ability, who seems to have dried up a bit. The songs aren't as well written, and while the music is o.k., it doesn't hold up to their earlier efforts. I have no problem w/ change, but I have always seen Glenn as a leader not a follower. W/ 777, Danzig have gone into a more contemporary sound, but have lost some of their magic along the way... much like BLACK ACID DEVIL. While this album isn't a total wash... it isn't great either... and while it isn't as bad as the previous live outing, it's not and album Danzig are capable of. I don't regret buying it, but I still wish it'd been a better album."
2,rock bottom...,"Well, I somewhat expected this album to be a bummer. And it sure is. Danzig's voice is shot to hell and there is too many effects being applied to it that it makes the vocals seem over produced. There is very little feeling in in his singing these days and makes me think that he is performing from his deathbed. The new band with guitarist Todd Youth (Murphys Law, Son of Sam) and others are lacking that evil hard rock sound that was critical of the classic first four albums. This gothic nu-metal is poorly done (even for the sheer fact that nu-metal/stoner rock is garbage.) Gave it two stars because it still might be worse with the next album. Please don't buy this. Get one of the early four albums."
5,Danzig returns to his old style and his roots,"This cd has not left my cd player. Elements of classic danzig (the first 3 albums) and his past (samhain) are on this disc. If you a long time fan like me....then you gotta get this. The production could have been a tad better because, the vocals are a little bit too far back in the mix on certain songs. After releasing two cd's that had their moments...i am glad to see that Glenn has put out a cd that has many moments!!! A must buy for a Danzig fan"
5,He is back with the nastiest and meanest rock since Danzig 4,"This is without a doubt the best Danzig CD since Danzig 4. Blackaciddevil was Glenn trying to be Trent Renzor. Satan's Child was although quite good but it was still not a solid effort throughout.With I Luciferi (777), Glenn brings back a bombastic hell-laden CD true to the hard rock form that he blessed us with his first four creations (Danzig 1 through 4 of course). From the demonistic riffs of ""Black Mass"", the evil groove of ""Wicked Pussycat"", the thunderous pounding of Joey Castillo's drum beat on ""God Of Light"", Glenn blood-curdling screams on ""Liberskull"" and ""Dead Inside"", and ""Kiss The Skull"" that has a sound like a locomotive spewing the fire from hell out its stack. All the other tracks are awesome as well.With this release, Glenn has redeemed himself fully. Although not as good as the first four Danzig CDs, it certainly ranks up there. A must have."
5,Glenn's infernal service is at hand,"This album is darker than any other Danzig album yet. It sort of reminds me of Samhain's November Coming Fire and a little bit of Satan's Child. I think that this is the 2nd best installment of the entire Danzig catalog. The best would have to be How The Gods Kill. Glenn is on top of his hell on this one, and with songs like Black Mass, Coldest Sun, and Halo Goddess Bone, this album should get lots of playtime in your discman or CD player. Danzig 777 will eventually be respected as the masterpiece that Earth A.D., November Coming Fire, and Lucifuge have become. Get this album."
4,Back to basics finally!!,"Glenn went back to the basic formula that worked so well on his first four solo albums. Good guitar riffs, good bass/drum bottom end, catchy songs, good lyrics. However, I am sad to say that his powerful clean voice is shot. All these years of giving it his all has probably ruined his vocal cords, but he did it for us. The over processing of his voice on the last two albums was probably because of the weakness of his voice. This time around, he did not use much effect on his voice except for doubling it, but the power he used to have in it is no longer there. This is a very good cd, as good as the first four, just be prepared for some weakened vocals. Glenn, we still love ya!"
2,These people are crazy,"I think Danzig is the finest artist of the last 30 years, but even I had to draw the line somewhere. This album is weak. There is no feeling at all in it. Glenn is just going through the motions. He realized that going industrial was a mistake and this was his attempt to go back to having a traditional band sound. There are only 2 or 3 songs worth anything."
1,disgrace,this album along with his lat 3 to 4 albums have sounded like korn albums. it has nothin to it and is just terrible music. what ever happened to the early danzig stuff? it was some of the bst evil blues i ever heard and was just awesome and such a creative idea. O rgo back to stuff like the misfits who are one of my favorite bands of all time but dont waste ur time with stuff like this
1,danzig has hit an alltime low....,"everyone knows danzig has done nothing but taint the memory for about 10 years now. i has watching mtv2 and saw the ""kiss the skull"" video. while listening kiss the skull it was so horrible it made me vomit. seriously. so in many ways i guess this was the most moving song danzig has ever written. he's almost completely lost his voice. he's sold out to the souless nu metal/wannabe industrial garbage. i'm a diehard misfits and samhain fan but it's now time for danzig to never ever release another album under any circumstances."
1,Caution - Hurricane Explodes!,"I bought four pedestal hurricanes and already two have exploded -- one in my hand and the other shattered while sitting on the counter. I was so afraid of the other two I took them off the table. Forget lighting candles, these candle holders are dangerous."
4,Good basic dvd recorder,"This is a nice recorder for + R format. It works in the US and overseas. It plays and records in PAL and NSTC. You can record 1,2,4 or 6 hours per standard DVD disk. Excellent for converting old family VHS,Beta, DV or Mini DV tapes to DVD. It will also record directly on dvd from your video camera. The only reason I did not give it a 5 rating is that it gets stuck sometimes in the menue and you have to unplug the unit and plug it back to go back to normal operation. Excellent buy for the money. I have three units and they all work fine."
1,Stopped working after 5 DVDS,"[...] I used it to record about 5 dvds from my old VHS cassettes. The instruction manual is definitely not the most user-friendly. However, I was able to start using the unit without much delay. The problem started after day 3 when I tried to stop a disk that was being recorded upon. The display said something like ""cannot stop recording"". I finally unplugged the unit to make it stop. Then I realized that the unit had stopped recognizing any disk and kept saying that all disks (prerecorded ones or the ones thatI had recorded earlier) were blank. Spoke to customer service (you have to try a few times to get thru to someone) and they said the read/write haead was probably malfunctioning. They are going to email me a shipping label to send the unit back for replacement. Shall provide an update on the new unit, if and when I receive one."
4,Good reprint - a Faxon Must,"I recently purchased this book and found it to be a high quality paperback reprint of the original.Its pages were all straightened and centered properly, unlike a copy I downloaded from the Internet several years ago.I recommend this for all Faxon descendants."
5,Soul Sister,"I am delighted to have obtained this signed copy of the anniversary edition. I read Soul Sister when it was first published and have wanted to read again many times. Grace Halsell was a courageous woman, who truly walked her talk. Thanks for the great service."
3,Easy to understand some basic things to run a small HRD team,"This book gives me a good understanding about how to run a small HRD team. It is written for you to get the important ideas, theories and so on. However, some worksheets given are somewhat out-dated, although they cover many ideas to check."
2,somewhat disappointed,Bought this to replace a Makita driver kit that worked well for many years. The quick release was not positive nor easy to secure. I expected more from DeWalt products. The drill bit came out several times during the first use and it is easy for the small hex screws to fall out and get lost. The Makita kit I used before had a hex wrench built in to the driver so you would have to worry about losing the provided wrench. This product works but I expected DeWalt products to be much better.
4,Good if you're only using one size.,"It has come in handy for applications that require pre-drilling, which is almost everything. My only complaint is that the tips are held in by a pin that must be tightened/loosened for installation. What this means is that it's faster not to use this at all if you are working with different drill or bit sizes. Maybe in the new model they'll use a some type of spring loaded clamp."
5,Excellent product,This is my second purchase. I owned one for over five years until I dropped it and bent the shaft. I've always use it to predrill when driving screws. Works like a charm!
3,"not bad, but need to watch install on youtube","good cheap humidifier I installed it quickly, but the humidifier kit and installation kit do not include a sail switch or any device to tell the solenoid when to turn on or off, so when I looked for a device, menards didn't have a clue and home depot gave me a number to call to order one. So do your research before purchasing!!!"
5,Excellent product,"Easy to install. If you have a newer furnace you probably do not need the swail switch as the HE220A comes with a Humistat which can be connected to the furnace. They recommend the Honeywell 32005847-001 Installation Kit, Bypass which is a little pricey and you can probably buy the pieces of this kit cheaper individually from Home Depot or Lowes or ACO as well as the filters."
1,Parts included have changed.,"Well, a simple install got complicated when between the separate install kit and the package here, I still didn't have all the parts needed. I even bought a 2nd install kit locally and was still without all the needed parts. (Sidebar: THe first install kit came with a VHS tape for install, useless in today's world for most of us, and the second one had NO install video of any type.)After a day of runaround from Honeywell, the item was returned to Amazon. It appears Honeywell no longer includes the sail switch in the kit, even though it's listed in the materials list and is essential to have a switch (or equivalent switching device) to make this work! It's now sold separately. Very disappointed in Honeywell."
4,HONYWELL HUMINDIFIER,ITEM ARRIVE IN TIME . NO REVIEW AS OF THIS TIME. ITEM IS NOT INSTALLED AS OF THIS TIME..WILL BE INSTALED IN JANUARY. THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD NEW YEAR. E.P.
5,So far so good,Purchased this a couple weeks ago and it works very good so far. It comes with a humidistat and I would not waste the money on the install kit. I spent approx. $15 and had all the equipment I needed to install this humidifier. The sail switch that comes with the kit is a waste and prone to failure as well as the transformer as long as you have a furnace that is maybe 15 years old or newer. Most furnace circuit boards will already have a (HUM) 24V terminal and all you will need to do for wiring is wire the HUM terminal and common (COM) to the humidistat and from the humidistat to the water solenoid valve on the humidifier itself. This will only turn on the humidifier when the furnace itself kicks on and it should provide the 24V required if wired correctly. Hope that helps.
3,Not sure that it's performing as advertised,Purchased to help improve the air quality in the winter time. The installation (self install) wasn't all that hard and the included instructions were pretty good. The install kit is HIGHLY recommended for this device. It's been installed for about a month and we are still working on tweaking the settings so it's performance may actually improve as we continue to work with it.
2,Only a couple of good songs,"The thing about 702 is, you can barely hear the backup vocals in any of their songs.It makes people think you cant sing when you sing under your voice. I still love em to death though"
5,The Lost Girls,"I heard ""Steelo"", on XM, ""Heart & Soul"" about three weeks ago. I don't know where I was when these girls were out. I am just finding them now. I coulda gone to my grave....This is a great album. These girls are great. If you like soul/R&B;, these girls RULE.Kris Peterson"
4,702..=) Love Em,I give this cd four stars cause its a couple of tracks I do not like but overall the album is good..I've always loved these girls & I wish they would come back THEY ARE MOS DEF one of the best girl R & B groups who really never got any credit for their music support this album
4,My favorite Guy Clark,"A college friend and roommate introduced me to this record back in the early 80's. We used to get together and drink jug wine (cheap 1.5 Liter Cribari) while listening to this LP. Some of the songs stuck with me and I ended up buying the CD a few years ago. I keep coming back to it every so often. I especially like, ""Broken Hearted People,"" He's a Black Haired Boy,"" ""It's Good to Love A Lady,"" and ""Anyhow I Love You."" Susanna Clark adds tremendous harmony vocals as well on these songs.For country/folk genre, this music instills meaningful ballads and heartfelt lyrics. It also captures a young man singing songs that he loves. An interesting addition to my CD collection."
4,emotional genius,"THis book should be a text book for all parents and children in school. Its a manual for how to handle our and other people emotions. It takes the stigma out of all those emotions we try to suppress and hide for social reasons and for fear we are mentally sick. I wish I had read this book a long time ago, it could have saved me a lot of suffering. Thankyou Karla!"
4,A world of information,An author with a world of experience provides a world of information from which the rest of us can benefit.An intense and practical learning tool for establishing boundaries and re-learning instincts that are generally stiffled as we grow.
5,angel song,"to put it in short: I. LOVED. THAT. SONG. It has a nice mix of english, that is very well pronounced, and the song itself is very beautiful. even if you're not a fan of soft music, or jpop, this song will hook you."
2,Sky blue socks are quite different to picture,Pretty disappointed with the style of the socks that arrived - they are this pattern [...] and not as pictured at all. I don't think they are as cute.
3,Not what I thought,"I don't exactly know what I expected - maybe a narrative from parents to children about how dull and empty their lives were before the child came on the scene. Or about the pregnancy and anticipation, something like that. This surprised me. As a Christian, I decided against giving this to a couple in our church (my husband is a pastor) as a baby gift because - well, their question or assumption would be that this reflects Biblical teaching, and I can't say that it does. It's a touching story; as I read it to my 4-year old, I thought it was a little over her head still in some ways. It's a bit too abstract for kids' minds in my opinion. They take everything literally. Adults who know or learn about the Rabbinic legend behind it might find it more entertaining or intriguing because of that."
2,Before You Were Born,"This is a retelling of an old Jewish folktale...it is not as rich as ""On the Night You Were Born"", which is positively lyrical and which I prefer as a baby gift, but it is beautifully illustrated."
5,Best dvd for upright bass out there!,"Todd Phillips has put together two excellent dvds. I've purchased several others but Todd's discs are the ones I'm keeping. A wealth of information even if you've played electric bass for years and are trying your hand at the upright. It isn't so much a teacher telling you how to play, but rather a bass player passing along his knowledge to another player. I hope he continues this series beyond intermediate."
3,"Good map, but too large for daily use on the streets of Paris.",Great map to use as a planning guide. Put I can't imagine fumbling with this large map in the middle of a Paris street!
4,Yankovic's life through the 1970s is documented,"Dolgan writes Yankovic's bio through the 1970s. An interesting, easy-to read book on the life America's Polka King, Frankie Yankovic. The book showcases Frank's tremendous achievements for the polka movement and depicts his turbulent, troubled family life with his first wife June and the problems of being a ""star"" and having a family.For those interested in polka music, this is an enjoyable, enlightening read!"
4,Dancin With THE KING,"Very good autobiography from the aging Polka King. Interesting reading on how the Original YANKS in post WWII rose on Columbia (now Sony) Records to the national pop charts with a universal 2/4 Polka , ""JUST BECAUSE"" and Later with a 3/4 ""BLUES SKIRT WALTZ"" History was made with the genius of Frankie Yankovic and his Yanks including.. Johhny Pecon (vocals & accordion), Georgie Cook (banjo), Al Naglitch (piano), Hank Bokal(drums) and Hokie Hocevar(bass)."
4,Just when I thought I had the plot figured out...,"Nick Seven and crew take you on an interesting, bumpy ride filledwith intrigue and plot twists. Never Trust Your Dreams is a quick, enjoyable read, and I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. Tim Smith's character development makes you wantto know more about the somewhat enigmatic Nick and exotic Felicia, the ""good guys."" The character Terri Holloway brings an aspect of malicious violence and sadistic pleasure into the mix, taking the somewhat derivative story to new heights. By page 120, I thought I had it all figured out, and then was taken on a speedboat ride full of twists and turns. I hope that Tim Smithis writing a sequel, because I connected with the heroes and can't wait to see what the villians are up to next. There's plenty of derring-do going on in Florida, and I hope that Nickstays on the CIA's most-watched and wanted list. If you're looking for intrigue and mystery, this is a dream of a book."
4,A thought provoking experience.,"After listening to this book, I found myself rewinding it to listen again. Dr. Chopra's principles are simple to understand, and do not conflict with most religious convictions. For me, this book has enhanced my understanding of what role I play in my own healing or dis-ease in life. In taking the time to perform the meditation of which Dr. Chopra speaks, has helped this me to slow down, listen to what my body says, and act accordingly. I am sharing my good fortune with others."
5,Fun and charming!,"My 6-year old and I just finished this book, and we both loved it. It's so funny and so playfully written, with colorful illustrations to match. I think children of all ages (and anyone who's a kid at heart) will find something to like in this book. Highly recommended!"
1,"NO imagination, boring book","I recently purchased this book for my child, based on both the cover picture and the short description on the jacket. I was very disappointed in the book. The plot of the book was especially disappointing. The characters were cardboard and seemed juvenile for the intended audience, but their weakness was nothing compared to the plot. My daughter and I didn't even bother reading the book to the end."
2,A bit too sensationalized,"I had heard bad things about this book several years ago from friends who were also graduates of West Point, so I read it myself to find out. I remember Barkalow from times in the hand to hand combat pits where she was teaching hand to hand at West Point to when she was stationed across the street in Germany. In my opinion, most of the things that she says that occurred to her at West Point because she is a woman are questionable. I do know that I had much of the same harassment at West Point as a male Cadet and had similar rough times as an Air Defense Lieutenant in Germany. It is a bit too sensationalized to be accurate in my opinion. Read Gail O'Sullivan's book (Tough As Nails) if you want a more accurate portrayal."
1,Give it a pass,Little of the humor or insight of other books by women from West Point. Not worth the cost.
4,Former squad mate at West Point,I was a Plebe (freshman) at West Point when Cpt. Barkalow was a junior. I served in the same company (A-3) as she did and was also in the same squad for a time. She was a no nonsense person of absolute integrity. I'm glad to see this story get out because even at the time of these events they were not common knowledge to fellow cadets. Recommended reading reading for anyone interested in how females have integrated into the military. Would be interested in an update given the current Iraq war in which women are in the front lines.
4,better than most,Walter Hyatt wrote classic and timeliess songs. Most of this album is clear and clean - there are only two less than very to outstanding songs. The rest stand up to repeated listenings and take you where he wanted you to go.
2,LOOKS GOOD BUT THATS IT,They look good in my truck but they have nothing to hold them still and they slide all over I'm always readjusting them...
1,A Disappointment!,"Based on the Amazon reviews, I purchased this book hoping to get some layout ideas. What a disappointment! Ok--if you like strapbound albums, paper piecing, using multiple, unrelated patterned papers, designing pages with sticker attacks, and handwritten titles, you might find this book useful. However, if you purchase it keep in mind that it was printed in 2000--an aeon ago in terms of where scrapbook design has come. There was one page on mosaics which was a bit interesting. The one page on embossing was just that--one page with a picture of what was supposedly embossing. There is nothing on layouts, nothing on use of fabric, metal, clay, or chipboard embellishments, nothing on handmade cards, nothing on using a digital camera, nothing on using creative titles. It is somewhat interesting as a historical document of how the craft has evolved. Beyond that, it is pretty much useless. I had thought that something by Michele Gerbrandt would offer more."
3,decent.,"it's a mixed Cd. My Dying Bride, Moonspell, and Christian Death all contribute some good doomy gothic metal tracks. Nothing amazing but it is a good intro to people discovering doom metal."
3,an aquired taste,"if you can get it cheap, there are a couple of notable tracks. see if you like it before u get it, otherwise you will be dissapointed. it was not what i expected, but after i came back to it, i found it makes good background music if you are working."
5,What an Adventure!,This book was a great adventure with all kinds of suspense that kept one reading and reading about one brave woman! I loved it and have recommended it to many friends!
5,A good CD of Music,"The album has some songs that make you do what Ms. Goldberg did in that movie you know, make your on way and with that way change what you think needs to be changed and don't take no for an answer!!"
3,Ice Aid Large NeoWrap 3 in 1 Hot Cold Therapy,"Great concept, functional design, stays pretty snug. Only con is the sleeve you slip the ice pack into is a light fishnet type material. No matter how careful you are, sooner or later it is going to snag, once snagged, it will ultimately tear and break down. I cut the sharp corners off the ice packs they sell to use with these but it snagged anyway. Sleeve needs improvement to last as long as actual wrap."
3,Decent performance. Bad design,"Performance is ok. lags behind the P4 Hyper threaded model speed wise. But not much (floating point operations was one area where the P4 HT far outperformed this P4 Centrino).But the real annoyance is the overall design. The power jack is on the right. so if you use an external mouse and are right handed, the chord comes in your way.The head phone jack is in the front. So, you really cannot keep this laptop on your lap and listen to music with a headphone - not unless you are comfortable with the headphone jack pocking your abdomen.battery life is much less than advertised. If you use the wireless network, then mine gives just 3 hours."
1,Big disappointment,"My fault, too much xmas cheer, didn't read reviews - one would expect color photos from a book featuring a car in color on the cover. Not so, black and white and some incorrectly identified - MY SON KNOWS CAMAROS!! Waste of money."
5,Superb mag for gamers who care about older games,"I won't waste your time with pointless babble...Retro Gamer is a truly remarkable piece of video game history. If you play games from yesteryear, then there is absolutely no reason you shouldnot have an ongoing subscription to this incredible mag.Just the fact that it exists is a testament to the fact that you NEED this mag in your collection. It will undoubtedly become rare and valuable over theyears, as video game journalism is a hot commodity.5 stars. Remarkable!"
1,Please no more self help!!!,"I'm getting tired of these types of self-help books. This one went beyond and was actually insulting - i.e., ""It's okay not to be perfect"" - Duh? Wouln't recommend it and didn't finish reading it."
3,Buy the other REK Live Album - No. 2 Live Diner,"It isn't that this is a bad album, it's just that the material isn't as strong as the rest of his albums.If you don't already own most of R.E. Keen's albums, you should buy his more recent live album, called ""No. 2 Live Diner,"" before considering this one. It's that other live album that contains all of his classic songs, such as ""The Road Goes On Forever"" and ""Five Pound Bass."" This earlier live album doesn't contain most of the Keen songs that have gone on to become his concert staples in more recent years.If you do own everything else by Keen, then there are a couple of gems here that aren't on his studio albums, such as ""Copenhagen,"" a very funny song."
4,Big sparkler,"Very nice ring, the stone is a little larger than I expected but I'm keeping it cause I love the bling! The antique styling is lovely. Solid construction, feels good on the hand. Can dress it up or down. The box it came in is not the same that is shown in the pics, heart-shaped and kinda cheesy. Luckily the ring is for me!"
3,Buyer beware,"Yes, this is a beautiful ring, however, within weeks of wearing it daily, many of the smaller stones fell out. It did not occur to me to check if there was a warranty, but when I did, it was too late. Just be aware that this ring only carries a 30 day warranty."
4,Beautiful But. . . .,"The ring is simply beautiful, but I didn't expect the stone to be as large as it is. It comes accross as kind of ""overkill"" for my taste. Overall if you like extra large stones, this is the perfect ring. I prefer more of a medium size stone. No problem with the order. Arrived on time. All Good."
5,very pretty,"Very pretty ring. It does run a little large, so keep that in mind when ordering. The marcasite detail adds a nice touch, and although the CZ isn't the best quality it is still very sparkly and the ring is a good deal for the price. I've attached a photo so you can see what it really looks like."
5,Practical help in the classroom,"This book is an excellent resource for teachers, counselors, and the entire school community. PRIM helps teachers identify both behavioral and academic difficulties by breaking each subject and behavior into categories. In addition, there are a wide variety of interventions that are practical for the classroom. This book is also a great to help with documentation of behaviors."
5,"great book, but what happened to that price?","This is a great Middle Eastern cook book that has served me well forten years. Thought I'd replace my copy but had a little sticker shockover the price.Anyway the recipes are great, especially the mezzeor appetizers. I make the hummus and the baba ghanooj all the time(the pages are really stained there). END"
3,modesto disco..no esperemos ya la genialidad.....,"basicamente este disco no decepciona si uno no espera encontrar la frescura, originalidad y desparpajo de sus primeras obras. aqui se escucha un buen grupo, inclinado mas al country que a la lejana locura del verano del amor...encima skip se quedo dormido con el koto encima....temas como ABOUT TIME, GOIN DOWN TO TEXAS, ODE TO THE MAN AT THE END OF THE BAR nos traen añoranzas de la gran riqueza que en algun momento mostro esta banda...reitero no es un disco mediocre....pero no es lo de antes!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I guess sometimes you have to compromise...,"""20 Granite Creek"" is finally here on CD - YES! The ""remastering"" is a little weak, and whoever-did-the-graphics for this re-release is NOT to be forgiven for having totally eschewed the original. Still: finally being able, without the guilt of having pilfered the tracks fron Napster in 2000, to hear the blessed ""Chinese Song,"" the greatest ""been there/done that"" song, ""Ode To The Man At The End Of The Bar,"" and the wonderfully-meaningless ""Goin' On Down To Texas"" - it almost makes up for the hideous repackaging. And if you're a liner notes freak like I am, Google can gve ya a print-out of who played what. Still: as I said, that picture of the Grape on the front added a lot to ""20 Granite Creek's"" appeal."
3,"Beautifully written, but incomplete","I fully agree with the peview reviewer who said:""As a reader, I often wanted more of Ira's world view than could reasonably be inferred from the vantage point of his younger sister. The author has attempted to give us more, I think, but the fullness with which Ira's character might have been fleshed out is never adequately realized.""Although I enjoyed reading the book (with the exceptions of those chapters written from the grandfather's perspective as I don't believe they added anything at all to the understanding of him or the other characters or the narrative), I was left feeling unsatisfied when I had finished."
5,A Journey of the Spirit,"With compassion and wisdom, Alice Lichtenstein takes us through the minds and into the hearts of her people, from Ira the boy genius to his Nobel Prize winning grandfather, from Phoebe whose love for her brother is unbearably passionate to their mother Eileen, a woman terrified by her children's fury and desire. THE GENIUS OF THE WORLD is a shattering story told with astonishing insight and redemptive clarity. This bold novel is a journey of the body and the spirit. Lichtenstein takes us from Princeton, New Jersey to the coast of California, from a family's Jewish history into a rebellious boy's mysterious conversion to Buddhism. Their story is so tender, so fully felt and fiercely imagined, I couldn't help thinking that the writer must have lived some part of her life with the soul of each one of her characters inside her."
4,Spot On,Great little Aussie movie. Simple but compelling story with a cast that would demand a zillion dollars these days to make it.
1,disappointed,"the pictures were misleading. the way the shopping cart cover zips up into a cute little bag is the best part about the product. while it covers most shopping carts, it does not stay on because the elastic is not very tight. it also takes way too long to insert the shopping cart seat belt through the tiny holes...not something you want to hassle with for a quick run trip to the store. i ended up purchasing the eddie bauer shopping cart cover from Target and i love it. i definitely wasted my money on this product and if i could, i would definitely return it!!"
2,Sleezy Marketing,"This book is entertaining, and a promising start, BUT, it is nothing more than a start: unlike a book in a true series, this one cannot stand on its own. It is really only the first chapter or two of a book rather than a complete story on its own. The characters are introduced, the stage is set, a mystery is introduced... and the book ends. Seems like a sleezy marketing ploy to inflate the price of a book by selling it in five installments. I enjoyed the first installment, but the rest will be checked out of the library. I'd advise other shoppers to do the same, or buy it used."
3,Not like Lemony Snicket,"I just reviewed this a second ago but I just had to add something. The books are not similar to the Series of Unfortunate Events in my opinion. Yes, the ""Dear Reader"" thing at the beginning did remind me of Lemony Snicket, but apart from that they're not at all alike. The warning on the back actually reminded me of the thing on the back of Artemis Fowl(""Stay back human...""). Also, having three main characters does not mean the two books are similar, I mean, HARRY POTTER has three main characters, along with a lot of other books! Face it, three is a popular number for main characters. So yeah, Spiderwick and Series of Unfortunate events are not the same."
5,Thimbletack and More A kids review,"This is a great series! It tells about the fantasy world around you, filled with brownies, boggarts, trolls and goblins. I liked Simon with all his weird pets, and Jared was pretty smart. Their big sister Mallory was mean and crazy just like mine. It's the kind of book that once you start it, you just can't put it down."
5,The Spiderwick Chronicles,"This book, which I have read is about three ordinary children. Their names are Jared, Simon, and Mallory Grace. Their mother, Helen Grace took their great- aunt Lucinda house. The three childred finds a book and they begin to read it. They learned all kinds of faeries,what is good and what is evil? And something happens to them that will change their life.The three Grace children then go on an extraordinary adventure.I would recommend this book to other kids should read this book if they loves adventures, battles, and a lot of fantasy. I enjoy this book very much and you should enjoy this book too."
2,The Field Guide,"In the firlst book of the Spider wick series (The field Guide). Jared, Malory,and Simon find a field guide about faries and magic toads and dwarfs. Then they start getting atacked by Magic toads because they dont want mortals reading and finding about there culture and making money off them. I personaly do not recommend this book but that is just my opinion and just my taste. So if you want to read this book it is your choice!"
5,great start off,anybody who thinks this is a rip off of any book their dumber than a bag of rednecks.this is enchanting and a great start to a good series
5,A whole new adventure book with faeries,"I found the first Spiderwick Chronicle a big hit and found it nothing like The Series Of Unfortunate Events.Jarred gets into a lot of fights in school ever since his dad left him, his twin brother Simon, older sister Malory and Mum.So when he moves into his new house he notices a lot of strange things that his knowledgable twin and spunky sister notice too.There is somebody, living in the wall of their new house creating a whole series of mayhems around the house.After his Mum suspecting him as the culprit, Jarred is determined to put a stop to the evil creature and prove himself innocent.Spiderwick, for me was an entertaining read, and proved a lot of sayings to me such as:Don't trust a book by it's cover.Holly and Toni have done excellent jobs on the completion of their first book and i can't wait to put my head into the second. These books are cool!"
4,Spiderwick,"Written in the spirit of Harry Potter and The Series of Unfortunate Events, Books One and Two of the The Spiderwick Chronicles are delightful. Thanks to Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, the Grace kids' story, complete with rhyming riddles, injured griffins, and hobgoblin spit, is artfully told. I have only one complaint...the third book isn't out yet!"
4,Perfect for kids,A book that came recommended from my online reading friends.A bit mysterious. A bit about fairies. A little scary. Perfect for kids.
3,Where's the rest of the book?,"I read this book to see if it would be appropriate for my first grader and I liked the story and will let her read it. The artwork is really wonderful and the story has promise but it is so short!!! There is an old house, three children and fairy mischief but the action barely gets started in this book. I would recomend it for a younger reader who may get frustrated by reading a longer story. The artwork and story are great but it only got 3 stars because there's not much content for the price."
2,You're better off at the library!,"This book is about 100 pages minus a few full-page and many partial-page illustrations. It took less than an hour for me to finish the whole book. While it may take more time for younger readers, it is safe to say that this book is really short. I think the book doesn't have a great deal of reread value either. This book could easily have been combined with book 2 to create a book that is actually worth $10. I recommend you save yourself some money and check these books out at the library."
5,Very good book,This book I enjoyed alot.I liked this book because it is fantasy yet also it makes you think. I loved this book and wish that everyone will get a chance to read it.-Cole Dillingham
2,pretty good,"This book is not what you will expect. I thought there would be weird creatures, but there are not any creatures in this book except for Thimbletack. This book is about Jared, Mallory, and Simon going to a new home. That house is very creepy. Jared finds something called the field guide and finds his grandfather's (Arthur Spiderwick) library and at the very end of the book the kids find a creature named Thimbletack. The best part of this book is where Jared reads the field guide out loud because that part is interesting. My favorite character is Simon because he can be funny. However, the thing I don't like about this book is that it is not an adventure or anything like that. My least favorite part is when Jared, Mallory, and Simon find Arthur Spiderwick's library. It creeped me out. My least favorite character is Jared because he always gets into trouble. I think nobody should buy this book."
3,the most horrible book,"I DIDN,t like the first book of spiderwick because it was kinda weird, I got lost . The book is basically about 2 brothers and ther sister, they move into their grandmas house and they all think it is ragedy and creepy. I liked the 2nd and 3rd better."
5,I think this book is great,"I think this book is great. I think it should receive a silver medal. In this book a boy named Jared has creepy things going on in his house. Jared and his brother and sister try to find out why weird things are happening. They find and old book and find out that the strange things happening are from ornery brownies that do not want them there. I read the second book to, The Seeing Stone. The second book is just as good as the first book. I can't wait for the third book."
3,"Good, Wrong Age Group","I read this for one reason, because the movie is coming out. I was expecting a book. I did not get a book. I got a chapter of a book. I could see this for 7-9 year olds. But 9-12? I don't think so. The language is right for that age group, but the ""book"" is extremely short and the only reason I could see the book being so short is to make money. There wasn't even a real ""book"" feel to it. There was no real conflict, no rising and falling action no climax. It was like the introductory chapter of a book. It was good. But why should I have to buy three books to get a story that would fit in one?"
3,Exactly what is says,I got this book because I wanted to start juicing and blending in order to work more veggies and fruit into my diet without cooking. It has many juicing receipes and tells you some of the health benefits for the various fruit/veggies.
5,Elaine LaLanne's Total Juicing Book,"The book arrived in great condition and the information within was wonderful. Best part is the fact that little is thrown out. I've always thought it was a waste to throw out the pulp, well she has recipes for the pulp. I made the soup and my husband loved it. I threw in some extra's of my own and each time renovated it for a new experience."
2,love the lalanne's,"book had alot of choices and background for different recipes, unfortunately too many to choose from. most books in this area are like this though so this isnt unusual."
3,Like new?,"The book said used - like new but the pages were yellowed, the book had someone's hand writing in it and some pages were ripped. Other than that it was ok."
3,index needs improvement,"great recipes but really hard to find them. I have to flip through the book to find recipes, that are not listed by condition or in many cases, the fruit or vegetables in them."
4,juicing book,"This book is full of wonderful info on nutrition and recipes involved with juicing. It was copyrighted in 1982 however so I assume it may be a little behind the scientific curve as far as nutritional info is concerned. I do like the book however. It has been a great, super easy to read start on my juicing journey."
4,A good book for beginners.,"This book contains several delicious recipes; the ""Tomato Salsa Drink"" gets an A+. Its greatest strength are the recipes for the pulp, the fiber remnants. Each recipe lists the vitamins found in each drink, as well as the health benefits.The Index is lacking and could be more specific. If you're looking for a recipe employing a specific fruit or vegetable, not ALL the recipes using that item are listed.Still, it is a useful book, expecially for one 'new' to juicing."
3,Good general source for juicing recipes,"Good things about this book include lots of recipes for juice and for using the pulp as well as a general guideline what each type of juice is good for in health terms.What didn't work for me was that even though there were some pulp recipes, I would have liked more. I generate a LOT of pulp and am looking for creative ways to use some of it. This book has only one muffin recipe and that was not a tasty treat."
3,Fair juicing book,"After reading several different juicing books while I do my juice fasts, this one ranks 2nd with me. It has a lot of information, but not easily found recipes. I find myself using this book only occasionally."
4,Great book,"This is a very good book. I am a new ""juicer"" and this book had alot of information and great recipes. Very pleased."
4,Good but could be better.....,"After reviewing this book I thought it pretty good. It had recipes for the pulp, the vitmins and what ailments the juice is good for. However, it could have been better organized. ex. if you want something to improve skin it would've been better to have it all drinks for skin grouped together. Also while explaining the benefits of juicing it doesn't tell us what any of the downsides are. Also, I think it might could more instruction on some topics such as the juicing for weight loss and detox. It does not explain if you drink it all day, just once a day or if its use yur own judgment. But its still good."
4,No inside pictures,"i havent try to make any kind of juice from this book.It's probably good. But, what i don't like, is that it doesn't have any picture of any of the juice they have."
5,The MAN ZONE!,"Tim Allen in the concerts that launched his career. Not for the kids, but definitely a belly-buster for the adults. Man stuff at its finest - tools and tips from the master of home improvement disaster. It also includes a recent interview made just for the DVD that's well worth the watch. Check it out. You won't be sorry (sore, maybe, from laughing so much, but definitely not sorry)."
5,Happy to Find!,"My mom was wanting Tim Allen: Men are Pigs for so long, and I am happy I found this for her!! Two for the price of one; she has watched the disc a lot since it was delivered and I expect it might get worn out eventually."
4,We love Tim Allen - this includes an interview...,"I had never heard of Tim Allen until I saw the reruns of ""Home Improvement"". My husband and I ordered this DVD to see him in stand up comedy and were pleased that it included an interview where he shares his beginning in comedy. Since then we have read ""Never Stand Next to a Naked Man"" (hiliarious) and have learned even more about his personal life starting life with the last name of ""Dick"" and how his name was shortened to the Tim Allen we know. Everything Tim Allen does is good for those healthy belly laughs we all need. We own every one of his DVD's and love seeing them again and again when we need a laugh. This video is worth seeing at least once."
3,This is where star wars started to fail,"I thought the ending to the origial star wars trilogy was ok, but I just cannot give it a 5 stars like most are doing. For starters, I got real bored of the scenes on tatooine. Saving Han took way too much of the book and I just couldn't get into all the happenings on Lukes home planet. The biggest ptoblem I had with ROTJ was the fact that a bunch of teddy bears could defeat an entire legion of the emperors best troops, walkers and blasters!!! I hate the ewoks and may they never, ever return. Well this is a short review but I think star wars has started to fail dramatically.a hardcore star wars fan could overlook this but I can't. It's these kinds of things that has led me clser to star trek"
1,It sucked...,"I didn't like the book at all. Don't get me wrong, I love starwars...but the book was WAY TOO SLOW for my taste. In my opinion, you shouldn't read this book. Just buy the movie (if you can get special edition, that's great) and watch it for 2 hours instead of spending hours on end reading that poorly written pos"
4,"Excellent revelations, but Lucas should have updated it","Kahn did a great job in revealing Vader's, Luke's and Palpatine's motivations and thoughts. However, a glaring problem was where Obi-Wan tells Luke about how he took him to live with his BROTHER Owen on Tatooine. I know that was the original backstory, but with the prequels' release, we all know that Owen Lars REALLY IS Luke's step-uncle (since Owen is Anakin's step-brother). Lucas had the time to write that cute little preface in the re-release of this book. He should have bothered to change or at least ommit this inconsistent dialogue from the scene. This is a better storyline anyway, since Obi-Wan wouldn't have known his real brother well, having grown up in the Jedi Temple."
2,"ok, I guess","I was hoping for more insight into the characters, but instead it is just a scene by scene of the movie."
4,Skywalker the Jedi,Great conclusion to the original trilogy. This installment ties together most of the loose ends from the original trilogy and leads into the subsequent series books.
2,Glad I paid only $5 for it.,"Compared to NPR's expanded adaptations of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, their Return of the Jedi radio drama is anemic. Where the previous shows had more than 10 episodes, this one clocks in at a meager 6. At roughly 20 minutes per episode the length here is really no different than the movie's itself. Very little is added to the story, and what is added brings nothing special to the plot. Mark Hamill's replacement as Luke is dull and even wimpier. The biggest disappointment is how the climactic battle scenes between the Rebel and Imperial fleets and Luke, Darth Vader, and the Emperor are rushed, filling less than two full episodes.Not a terrible deal for what I paid, but it could have been a much better conclusion to the first trilogy."
3,Decent adaptation of final episode of first trilogy.,"As far as turning a clumsy script into a readable novel goes James Kahn's Return of the Jedi does a respectable job. There are no big differences between this and the movie and, unlike his work on Poltergeist, Kahn took no major liberties with the narrative. Fans will want to have it."
2,endor conflict,"It is really a shame how the best SW movie is the worst tie-in novel. After reading the first two, I quickly started this book. How I wished it would end."
1,"This book should be called ""Labor Pain""","I found this book profoundly UN-encouraging. It focused primarily on the negative aspects of childbirth and showcased many, many ""failed"" labor plans to illustrate the idea that women should be flexible in labor. I felt as if I was being given a talking-to by a bossy doctor the entire time. The only section I found very interesting was the part that focused on the history of pain relief, purely from an intellectual standpoint. I gained virtually nothing from reading this book other than a headache and a collection of negative thoughts about what childbirth can be like."
2,"Unfortunately, a one sided discussion","A book that ""doctors can recommend"" says it all. If you want to be happy with what your doctors recommends then this book is it. However, if you are interested in a balanced discussion of the pros and cons of medical interventions during birth then this book is not for you.While many of the quotes that they include provide an insight into different options unfortunately the editorial content consistently presents the doctor's pro-intervention viewpoint and glosses over potential risks.The content can also be misleading, for example they say that ""the maternal death rate in the US is significantly lower than that of most of the rest of the world"" but our maternal death rate is currently around 23rd in the world and about last for industrialized countries.I gave it two stars because the quotes and summaries of different methods where honest, balanced and represented many school of thought."
3,If you're leaning towards natural childbirth...,"I am hoping to have a natural childbirth, but bought this book to better understand options in pain relief. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the book was very supportive of that at all. Lots of information on how excruciating childbirth is, how many women are not in any way prepared for it, how it will be a pain like one you have never experienced and cannot comprehend, etc. I don't mind a medically-oriented approach, but if you're planning to try to have a natural childbirth, this book is a bit scary! Good overview of medication options."
5,Road Scholar,"Codrescu manages to find the most wonderfully quirky places in America! His hilarious road trip is engaging. If I ever travel the U.S. by car, I hope to find the same type of characters that he did. You will love it!"
4,Slice of America through New American Eyes,"Part of the charm of this film is that it is dated (Mid-1990's) but the themes it explores in America are still strong. The draw and freedom of the open road, pockets of powerfully different cultures and Codrescu's own poetic observations on the country's coolness and contradictions make for a fine mix. This is no block-buster movie but a light original somewhat informative film with whit and style."
4,"Short, full of scripture and good","This looks like fluff, but don't judge till you read. Full of scripture, it goes deep enough to hit you for days. I want to have a copy of my own, but it is out-of-print. The topics deal almost exclusively with personal, soul-based issues that bring you or keep you from God. Lots of good references also. I loved it."
1,"Gimmick, no stars from me.","As the song says.""you gotta have a gimmick."" Who doesn't think that eating 1450 calories and doing exercise will allow you to lose a bit of weight?? Your once daily treat, as described in the book, is some kind of food containing 50 calories or less.For that you get 1 diet cookie!! 1/2 cup no fat, no sugar ice cream is 90 calories so you would be allowed 1/4 of a cup. Jorge imparts the illusion that you can eat just about what ever you want,if you just adhere to the 3 hour schedule, but when you read the ""fine print"" there is not a thing that is new. To eat every three hours without carefully watching those pesky calories would do little or nothing. On his diet, people who have been pigging out on the wrong kinds of food will be improving their food choices. Just as with the low carb craze, if you give up glazed donuts for veggies you will benefit. Not new,nor magical. Save your money."
4,3 hour diet,I love this book. It is inspiring and really helps me keep motivated. I have just started following this nutrition plan and have already lost 6 pounds.
2,Is it the timing or the restrictive calorie intake?,"The suggested caloried intake for anyone under 200 pounds is 1450 calories per day. Most overweight Americans consume many more calories than this in a day. I suspect that even if one didn't stick to the strict 3-hour eating schedule, one would lose weight. For example, this caloric intake would allow a 30 year-old, sedentary female to maintain a weight of approximately 110 pounds. Mr. Cruise has some visual guidelines to help you to estimate calories rather than strictly counting, but I suspect that close adherence to the 1450 calorie plan is the only way you will see the 'guaranteed' 2-lbs. per week weight loss."
1,nothing in here you can't get elsewhere and better.,"This is esentially the same as Body For Life, minus the workouts. The BFL recipe book offers much better meal alternatives, in fact. It is also very similar to the diet that comes with all Bowflex products, only difference being one less meal a day.The first one-third of this book is simply endless bad-mouthing of other diets.I encourage everyone to read the reviews for the Body For Life books, they are probably available at your local library if you are interested in the books themselves."
2,I had high hopes,"I am at a plateau and need to lose 10 pounds. I was hoping that this book would help since eating every 3 hours is reasonable. Nothing yet, my plateau continues and I am at week 3. Maybe I'm to anxious, but the book promises weight lose in the first week. I have a friend who purchased one of Cruise's 8 minute books and she lost 2 dress sizes, and she was not even trying to lose weight just tone. I will solider through the diet for 2 more weeks but after that, if no results then I am done.The book has a helpful, but short frozen food purchase list for lunches and dinner. I'm not happy with the diet, but if you have more than 10 pounds to lose it will may work."
2,Based on Faulty Premise?,"This book is based on a dubious premise: that if you don't eat every 3 hours your body launches a ""starvation protection mechanism (SPM)"" in which it saves fat and cannibalizes muscle, keeping you fat. But what about all the men in prisoner-of-war camps who were starved? Their bodies didn't slow down their metabolisms and keep them fat; they ended up looking like skeletons. Also, Cruise states that you shouldn't eat 3 hours before going to sleep--that, plus 8 hours of sleep equals 11 hours, almost half a day, when you are not eating at all, much less every 3 hours, so isn't SPM already working against you for almost half a day? I find if I don't have milk and cookies just before retiring to bed that my stomach gets all acid and growls during the night, waking me up. I think the every 3 hours bit is just another diet gimmick."
2,Skeptical about high ratings,"As this book covers nothing new (done better in the Zone), it's hard to believe so many people are raving about it and giving it 5 stars. I thought it was interesting to note that almost every reviewer that gives it 5 stars has only posted one review to Amazon. Either this guy has some core followers who would give it 5 no matter what, or there's a bit of a marketing conspiracy here. (Yes, I realize the irony of this being my first review)."
1,Goodwill Bound,"This is a worthless book in my opinion. Any diet book that tells you to eat fast foods is major crock. Most people will gain 5 lbs by just walking into a McDonalds let alone eating what they have on their menu. Watch the movie Supersize Me.The book consists mainly of what are supposed to be inspirational platitudes like ""Don't say 'If I could , I would' Say 'If I can, I will.'"", 130 pages (1/3 of the book) of daily 'visualizations', 3 hour timing tips, and daily plans, and some recipes that anyone could easily find on the WWW like vegetable lasagna or tuna wraps.The book is printed in the lightest ink you can imagine making it extremely difficult to read.Look for my copy of this book in my local Goodwill Store."
3,If this book was just released today (March 29th),How can a review with today's date claim the book helped her lose pounds?
3,The 3-Hour Diet: How Low-Carb Diets Make You Fat and Timing Makes You Thin,"I think this book contains information that can be benefitial to someone trying to loose wait. It gives you aa different approach that isn't like starving yourself. Though most of the book is a journal and mental convincing, it does include a breakdown of calories and some recipes."
3,A Thousand Times Before,"This has been said, written, and sold, a thousand times before.The basic concept of reducing body fat percentage by when, and how often, one eats, instead of what a person eats, is laughable at best.In every healthy nutritional and eating program, time, and spacing out meals, is one of the essential principles. It's just one piece of a big physiological puzzle. It's not the primary one.For many people (depending on metabolism and lifestyle), catabolism begins approximtely 4.0 hours after a person's last meal.People run a caloric surplus, maintenance, or caloric deficit.It's that simple."
4,It is a great,This book is highly recommended for those who want the weight loss but can only do minimum exercises.From what I have read so far it seems to be a book that gets right to the point. I hope that some people don't take it to serious.It is a great way to set yourself up for success! It guides you through getting mentally prepared to succeed as well as help you to set yourself up with a support system to succeed. It is fantastic!I would also recommend other book Sex and the perfect lover by Mabel Iam. it has every thing from sex to women and men's rights issues.
1,Flawed in so many ways...,"First of all, this book is incredibly sexist. All of the ""before and after"" pictures of weight loss success are of women!...except for a picture of the author and much information about himself. What? Aren't there at least a few overweight men in this country who have successfully reduced their weight by using Mr. Cruise's techniques?I find cause for suspicion in that 99% of the clinical information Mr. Cruise cites is from studies done in other countries. Why, when there are also many excellent short and long term studies done in this country that he could have included ?????In addition to the above, this book seems poorly edited in that it is somewhat disorganized and the text does not ""flow"".I do not recommend you purchase this book."
2,Don't Read the Book.....,Everything you need to know is already out there. Eat every three hours. Keep your blood sugar stable. Pick healthier choices if you can. Exercise a little. I got all the info from the media and I had lost 10 pounds before even buying the book. I read the book and got nothing new from it. Don't bother. Just do the diet. Its great!
1,The 3 Hours you must wake up early to really eat w/your family.,"I bought two books, one for me, one for my mom. I wish I could return them both. My husband and I did the diet exactly how it is to be done and lost 1 pound in 2 weeks. I was getting up at 5:30 am to eat breakfast so we were on the same schedule. If you live a normal life (stay at home moms) this is not the diet for you! Unless you don't want to eat dinner with your family EVER!!!! BIG DISAPOINTMENT!!!!!"
2,Nothing new here,This book just tells us what we already know but don't always follow.I also found that his claims that no foods are off limits was very deceiving. You can eat anything you want as long as meals (3 total) are 400 calories each and snacks (2 total) are 100 calories each. There is also a 50 calorie treat allowed after dinner. There are a lot of foods that would easily go over the 400 calorie mark!
3,Somewhat Confusing,"Jorge has a difficult time deciding which side of the fence he prefers to graze. His 3-Hour Diet book states that no foods are ""out,"" especially carbs. He constantly puts down the Atkins diet. I am not sure that he has ever really ""read"" the Atkins diet book. The Atkins diet promotes complex carbs and discourages simple carbs. In Jorge's Carb Swap System, he limits carbs. While the Carb Swap System is pretty much straight forward, 15 grams of sugar and 6 servings of carbs per day, his 3-hour diet is very difficult to decifer. With the exception of the number of calories, he never goes into how he determines which foods are acceptable and which are not. It would help for the ""dieter"" to know how to determine the acceptable foods.With this said, I do believe that one does eat less when eating every three hours. It helps to control portions. I have been doing this for the last few days and it seems I am never ready to eat when my three hours are up."
2,For the VERY VERY beginner...,"Seems to me that there were too many stories from the author's clients and not enough hard evidence from authorized medical studies to see if this program really works. And really, does the starvation mechanism really kick in after 3 hours? Some people yes, some no. Feel that the author was too critical of other diet plans in the book. And no exercise? Unless you're truly a beginner at the weight loss game, and need this to start at a totally basic level, this is not for you."
4,Helpful Information and Motivation,This book has great information and a pretty simple premise. The author makes you strive to do better. Worked for me. Worth picking up!
3,ok,Sender was great; just not that thrilled with paying for an entire book to basically learn that I need to eat every three hours..
2,Disappointing- - Confusing Plan- hard to figure out,"Jorge has the right idea. Keeping blood sugar stable by eating every 3 hours. The book does not outline the plan very well or give easy to follow sample diet- It would be most useful to have a sample 2 week menu plan to give one an idea of how to structure it.Instead you have 50+ pages of blank worksheets. Jorge tells you that your meals must be 400 calories, snacks 100 calories, and treats 50 calories- but does not qualify what the composition should be- so does that mean if I eat only pizza but in the correct quantities at 3 hour intervals I could lose as much as on a balanced diet? I don't think so!I actually wrote to Jorge to try and get better info but got a canned response. Probably need to join the website to maybe get the info.The recipes in the book were a bit too complex for my hectic life.All that said, I would still like to try the diet- just like to have more clear information about how to follow it!"
3,I was very disappointed,"I was really excited to get this book, but I kept turning and turning the pages trying to get to the actual ""plan"". I felt too much was put into ""why"" it works instead of instructing you on ""making it work"".Many pages were dedicated to note taking which I could do on a legal pad. Then foods were ""listed"" which is good for some people, but I need to see suggested meals planned for each day for a week or two. This helps me to copy and follow a stuctured plan.Like many of the reviews I have now read, just eat six meals a day and watch your portions. I could have saved myself another book to put on the shelf!"
1,Not worth time or money,"This book has a great idea and for many it probably works. But, the main reason it ""works"" is that you are on a 1400 calorie diet. Save your money, read the labels and eat six small meals a day, if you can, and don't eat over 1400 calories. If you are not capable of doing this, you can always buy the pre-packaged food that they are trying to sell you in the book."
4,CONTROLS MY APPETITE,EATING THREE HOURS HAS HELPED ME REDUCE MY CALORIES AND NOT FEEL HUNGRY. I LOST 3 POUNDS IN THREE DAYS EATING A HIGH FIBER DIET AND EATING EVERY 3 HOURS. I EAT 300-400 CALORIES AT EACH MEAL AND A MINIMUM OF 35 GRAMS OF FIBER A DAY. ONE TIP TO BOOST YOUR FIBER INTAKE IS TO EAT A VEGGIE BURGER WITH TWO SLICES OF A HIGH FIBER BREAD. THE FIBER35 DIET GOES GREAT WITH THE 3 HOUR DIEThttp://astore.amazon.com/myantioxidantdiet-20/detail/1416560092
3,Nothing new here...,"I am a fan of Jorge Cruise, even though I think working out for 8 minutes a day won't do too much, it's still better than nothing. He gives sound nutrition advice in his new book, but it's stuff we already know. Don't skip meals? Heard it. Eat lots of fruits and veggies? Duh! I just keep on reading books filled with advice I could jot down and make into a book myself. If only I were famous...Most people KNOW what they need to do--eat less and exercise--they just don't DO it. Me included. If you want a diet book that will join your others on your bookshelf of failed diets, go ahead. I suggest using the money you would have used to buy this book ($16.47) to buy yourself the fruits and veggies he recommends eating. Knowing you saved $16.47? Priceless."
3,A Bit of Effort!,The book was very motivational and full of facts. Its just I wishsomeone would update the Scarsdale Diet. He made it so simple and easyto follow. Three meals a day worked really well when you have a family.I used to lose a pound a day as well. Somebody out there update Scarsdalenobody organized it easier. A weeks full of menus so one couldn't eventhink of cheating.
5,Blues for Beginners and Other Obsessions,"This is one of the best voices in fiction in a decade. Edgy, charming, heart wrenching and just plain brilliant. Every writer could learn from Podell about how to turn a phrase, and every reader will find themselves thrilled to turn every page. Love it. Love it! Love it!"
5,My Puppy Loves These!!,"After reading about how lots of dogs are actually allergic to wheat and can't digest corn, I looked everywhere for some organic dog treats - thank you so much Amazon for making these available! My puppy tore right into them and keeps coming back for more!"
2,Not for timid tummies!!!,"My puppy does NOT like these! And well, mom doesn't like them either! The smell of garlic is so overpowering, I tossed them a week ago and I can still smell them! I think if your dog likes strong flavors these are for you, but they give my little guy diarrhea!! I would recommend the same brand in the Peanut Butter and Honey flavor, much gentler on tummies and my puppy can't get enough of them."
4,Shadow says,Shadow loves these treats and no grain. He is an English Cocker and prone to ear problems. These treats are best for his allergies.
3,"Family Ties in England, Scotland, Wales & Ireland",Not quite what I had expected. There's an awful lot of legwork involved in researching my ancestors and this doesn't seem to be the time saver I had hoped it would be.
5,A voice as clear as spring water.,"This remarkable collection of stories is well named; it is, indeed, Kentucky, straight. No frills, no gimmicks, no adornment, just a clear voice telling stories that draw a reader in from the first paragraph. ""Old of the Moon"" took my breath away. ""Smokehouse"" should be required reading for any boomer tempted to whine their way through mid-life. ""Nine-Ball"" makes you look at gun racks in pick-up trucks in an entirely new light. In his pure voice, this writer leaves us with extraordinary images: bills of cash twisted around barbs in a stretch of fence; splitting a wooden match and saving half for later; roads not good for hauling things in, but only for taking coal out. Each of the stories in this collection is a gem and this reader found herself thinking about them long after they'd been read."
3,His people are real without judgements or stereotypes.,The book jacket says that Chris Offutt writes about Kentucky without becoming sentimental. I agree. Some of the stories are so human that they could have taken place anywhere in the world where urban life threatens rural ways centuries old. Other stories are straight out of the hills of Kentucky and he brings to life that little part of the world. He writes about real people without making judgements or using stereotypes which is most refreshing.
5,GREAT KIDS CLIMBING SHOE!,"My son loves these, they make him climb like spiderman...Ooo ok, maybe not like spiderman BUT they are very sticky and help him climb for sure! The fit is excelent and the looks are super! Would order again if needed!"
1,Dont' bother buying this page. Search it in Google Books,"This is just a one page description of what the real book is about.By going to Google Books and searching for the same title, you will get up to 20 free pages to read. A much better deal."
5,"If you're dating or thinking about dating, this is a ""Must Have!""","David Steele has written what ought to become a benchmark in its field. Practical, proactive, easy-to-read and jargon free, David Steele helps his readers learn how to identify the kind of people they want to be with, how to weed out bad matches before asking for or accepting a date, and how to become really, really CLEAR about the kind of life partner relationship they want to grow.This is a book that I recommend to all of my clients who are dating or planning on dating at some time in the future. You can tell that David Steele, MA, founder of the Relationship Coaching Institute is a relationship coach, because he's darned good at it.If you don't have this book, buy it; you'll be happy that you did.George Polley, MSW, LICSWpsychotherapist and life coach"
4,A mellolution,"Meticulous bouts of smooth jazz guitar with a highly refined vocabulary makes this masterful guitar solo work, in league with the most assured stringsmiths around. A definite for fans of the craft, but perhaps to contemplatively quiet for Jazz beginners. Although tracks may tend to bleed into one another, Van Eps' crisp, intoxicating brand of playing remains front and center."
4,Ransomed Bride,"I ejoyed this book. You could really feel the emotion of the woman. Some parts made me cry. Highly recomend this book, its a keeper for me."
5,Church Libraries Book,This book is very helpful for classifying books.000- Generalities and etc. The book was also in Very Good Condition. I would order from Sam's Book Storeagain. Thank you.Nancy G
1,Dissapointed,The sound quality of this dvd is bad. I have an mpeg file of 6 underground (downloaded off the net) which has better sound than this dvd.
4,A Fun FPS,"This game has really nothing to do with Bond himself, but about an agent that isn't accepted by MI-6 so he goes rogue (a gun for hire). Upset that he wasn't accepted, of course, Goldeneye (his nickname due to one of his eyes being gold) joins the bad guys. The best part of the game is all of the classic characters from many of the films; Goldfinger, Dr. No, Scaramanga, Blofeld, Pussy Galore are just some of the characters that are on this game. The game itself is fun, but suffers from over-long levels and it is kinda hard, but not impossible. Overall, this is a decent game that fans of Bond and FPS should enjoy. I've been playing it for a while and it is still entertaining."
3,Ok but not best of class,"Lots of books deal with this topic and I have reviewed many. This is more of a rant but with some good points: we are all insecure and unsure about ourselves, the beautiful and the not so; show interest in others instead of trying to be interesting; you miss, as a great hockey player said, 100% of the shots on goal you never make. There are a bunch of case studies at the end from the author's own life illustrating these points. At first I thought he was bragging but on second thought I think he was just trying to get guys to get in the game. Strauss and Mystery have better books but if you have the time, flip through it."
2,This product is simply ugly,"The lotion is extremely runny and the bottle almost appears to be dirty (the coloring of the bottle is terrible.)I enjoy lots of the other Cucumber & Green Tea Scent Dove products, such as deodorant and body wash. But this lotion falls short of those by a long shot.I will throw this bottle out before I use a fourth of it and switch over to something that doesn't look like I'm digging in a trash can to find something to put on my body."
4,Hmmm........,"This is a nice lotion. First, it did keep my skin hydrated, but not for as long a I expected. It smells faintly like cucumbers. It does make my skin feel refresehed but not a major cool feeling I was also epecting. The bottle is very nice, but here is my complaint. When I bought this I did not happen to look at how many onces this cute bottle held. The lotion last me *ALMOST* a week and a half. I just noticed you only get one(1) cup of product, a.k.a * onces. I would buy this product if it were lest expensive."
3,Dialogue-track,"More dialogue and less music than on most movie soundtracks, which makes this CD somehow of a disappointment. Otherwise, the quality is good."
4,.........IF ONLY!,"saw the movie which was good but not totaly true to the lady's life and included some scenes of downright silliness.that said this cd gave ross a chance to prove herself more than just another ""soul-city-singer"".there are sides that give the listner chills[strange fruit]and others very smooth[you've changed,don't explain].ross does herself proud!BUT the inclusion of movie dialogue just ruins the whole.who cares what dialogue the characters are sharing when the musical mood set is destroyed by it?no thanks gordy!music and ross are great...too bad the flow comes to a jerking stop whenever the ""movie"" takes over a truly fine musical performance.get it anyway,ross has never been better,too bad she never had the chanch to repeat this musical performance on it's own merits."
5,DIANA ROSS DOES A GREAT JOB,DIANA ROSS DOES A GREAT JOB Here Singing Billie Holiday's Songs.It's A Great Tribute First to The Legacy that is LADY DAY&THEN To DIANA ROSS WHo Not Only did a Great Job Acting but also doing the Songs with such EMOTION&FEELING.Good Morning Heartache is still the song.This is Very Essential Music.
5,Excellent,"I like to hear new music and ADF is more like a new genre in music. (Besides, they can actually sing!)This album is some of their best work and it's well produced. The first cd is worth it whether your already familar with ADF or just discovering them for the first time. I haven't even listened to cd2 yet.ADF is political. But then most of thier albums are on major labels too. So how serious can they be?"
3,Dov's book is better,"If ""From Reel to Deal, by Dov Simens, is Hollywood's top rated film how-to book then this book surely will take a close second."
3,no find what i look for...,"good book explain how to make films...what explain what explain do what explain don't, learning how to play how to set.."
5,the best for the money,"A lot of JFK books are going to come out because of the 40th anniversary of his murder. This little book is packed with quite a few pictures I've never seen before and has short quotes either by or about Kennedy. It's well done, tasteful and the price is right. One more thing it contains a CD that has the high points of JFKs speeches. That alone sold me on the book. Kennedy collectors-- if you are only going to buy one of the anniversay books I'd say that this one is for you."
3,A really mixed bag...,"It came off as too much of an ""in memoriam"" type celebration at times and less of a documentary. I believe the ongoing 60's music playing in the background as mentioned in other reviews kind of took away from it. I did like some of the readings from Johnny Depp."
5,Gonzo,An amazingly sad and yet well rounded life....wish I could have met the man.....genious does not do the man justice....what a mind!
4,Best of the HST documentaries,"Slick and well put together, with some great rare footage of a young hunter on assorted tv shows. Deep does a good job, and his ex wife Sandy gives some nice insight."
4,If you are a Thompson fan,see this film!!! Buy it if you can afford it. Listen to no other reviews.A must see if you are a fan.
4,"Great movie, but...","This is a good movie for anyone that is interested in HST, however, for me it seemed that i would rather have seen a few more interviews with Hunter, rather than an interview with someone about Hunter, i relize this movie came post-HST, but there are plenty of interviews with him out there. Other than that you get a pretty good idea about HST, but I insist that you do not watch this movie and run around acting like that was all there was to him, unless you plan to read at least one book by him as you dont really get a good grasp on a lot of the stories that are out there about the doctor and there a lot of them. This is a informational and a good movie for a backround about Hunter, but please, please, please read his works to find out about HST in his own words, theres nothing quite like it, you will see here as it is always said the movie is never as good as a book."
2,GONZO: THE LIFE AND WORKS OF DR. HUNTER S. THOMPSON,"A LITTLE REDUNDANT, POOR PICTURE QUALITY AND POOR FILMING. TRYING TO DEPICT MORE OF A ""LIFE STYLE"" THAN THE ACTUAL ISSUES DR. THOMPSON ADDRESSED AND PLACED THE SPOT LIGHT ON."
1,Poor,"I was interested in his life, but not enough to sit through this BORING dvd. It is so poorly put together and just plain boring. I have yet to get through the whole thing. Not even worth a penny."
4,The price of fame...,"Very well done...seems to capture the essence of Thompson's whirlwind lifetstyle...I think the filmmaker is clearly talented...however, although I very much enjoyed the backstory on the Fear and Loathing books, I couldn't help but think about the wife and child back home...seems like quite a lot of misplaced fawning over ""celebrity""."
4,Loved this film...,"my favorite of 2008. saw it twice in the theatre:once with my wife, and once with a friend (plussome beers we snuck in for the occasion. it justseemed right)...there's something in it for everyone: with equalparts wit, humor, fear & loathing. but it's alsoeducational, giving the viewer a pretty good snap-shot of the late-60s/early 70s - when HST thrived...Rent it, buy it: just make sure you see it...- cRAIG"
1,Dull and pointless,"I kept reading in the hopes that something interesting would develop. Instead, I found the cure for insomnia. The characters are vapid, their journey inexplicable and the results hollow. I feel cheated. Who can I talk to for a refund?"
1,Booo,"If you like a bunch of methaphors and a story that doesn't go anywhere, this is the book to read. If you like some depth to a book, meaning, interesting plot, I wouldn't recommend Dreaming Southern."
3,"Great at the beginning, but....","I'll keep it simple. The first two thirds of the book was great. It was all about the (mis)adventures of a 1950's wife and mother driving a carload of kids (and others) from Kentucky to California, via every side trip imaginable. I couldn't even finish the last third of book, leaving about 30 or so pages unread. SPOILER WARNING -- we never even get to find out how they made it to California! What happened between the Grand Canyon and Los Angeles? How did her husband react to her arriving weeks (months?) late? The book just jumped to present day Los Angeles. This ruined the book."
2,WHERE WAS THE EDITOR?,"Lots of things made me want to to love this book: glowing recommendations from writers I like, the cover, the premise.The book just didn't deliver. Plotting was the most serious problem, coupled with an ending that fizzled. Big chunks were missing or strained credulity: How does a contractor afford a house in such a high-rent district? In all those ensuing years, why wouldn't Lila Mae have gone looking for Juanita? Leaving their car on the cliff, how did the family get to California?Instead we get scads of extraneous details about Lila Mae's possessions or neighbors. Shame on the editor of this book!"
2,Dreaming of the end!,"I could barely get through this book. It was dull, plodding, and made little sense. The main character is a mother who seems to be everywhere but where she is supposed to be, and doesn't seem to know where she's going...although her children try to keep her on track, it doesn't seem as if she cares or even pays attention. Not a good ""southern"" novel in my opinion, and a difficult, not really enjoyable read."
2,Dreaming of finishing this novel...,"I always finish a book I started but at times I was tempted to quit and take this to the local used bookstore for trade. The idea for a great story was there but here is the problem...there is no story...I can hardly believe someone is that ignorant of the size of our country that they would think everything is a hop, skip, and jump away...Lila Mae is not a strong or smart character nor is she someone I can identify with. The reader is dragged across the country and then the book jumps to part two (her in her old age) before even getting you to California in Part One. For a huge gap, you wonder what the heck happened to her husband and what the deal is...I mean, why doesn't she get in any hurry to join him? I only gave this a two because I was mildly interested at times about what might happen to finish this novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes books with a good plot, good dialogue, or interesting characters because all are absent here."
3,Great story up until the last part,"I was really enjoying this book to the point where I couldn't put it down. The characters and plot were fascinating and different. It was fun reading about this family's adventures as they traveled across the country. Then right when it got to the point where they were about to finally reach California, the author shifted gears and jumped ahead 30 years into the future. There was no explicable reason for this, and it really hurt the flow and point of the book. By that point, the reader couldn't relate to or even care about the characters anymore. This was an extremely disappointing and confusing ending to an otherwise good story."
3,"Funny, Great Characters, No Plot","Linda Bruckheimer's debut novel is funny, has well written characters, but there is no plot and the second half is dissapointing.Lila Mae Wooten is traveling to California from Kentucky, with her four children and all of their belongings. She gets herself into all sorts of predictaments through all of her side trips and crazy escapades that are extremely funny. The characters are well written especially the wacky Lila Mae and Becky Jean the cynical teenage daughter.I am only rating this book 3 stars due to the second half which seems like a different book completely and does not tie into the cross country ride at all. I would definetely read another book by Ms. Bruckheimer because I feel she shows a lot of promise and I enjoyed the ride down Route 66 with Lila Mae."
4,A comedy disaster cruise through Highway 66,"The 1950's come back from all directions as we follow this disaster on wheels trip to California. At the wheel is the maternal drama queen who can barely turn the wheel of the car, much less pull a trailer loaded with everything they own. Her main concern is parking the car where she won't have to back up because she doesn't know how to negotiate the trailer. That pretty much explains her entire personality....this woman never backs up to re-evaluates situations. She goes plunging head long into situations that continue to roller-coaster her into one mess after another. And, therein lies the fun of this book. I loved recalling the names of the 1950's sundries they used and discarded along route 66, including the names of outdated cafes and gas stations. If you can recall sibling torture in the back seat of your parents old ford on a trip across country, this book is for you."
2,Big Disappointment,"Basically there is no plot to this story. The only likeable character is the oldest daughter who is cynical and spiteful about her mother's annoying ways and habits. The second half of the book is so drawn out, it makes you wonder if it'll ever end."
5,Great Phone,"Great phone - excellent sound for those with hearing problems. I bought this phone for my uncle and it really delivered on the sound for him. I love the large buttons and the ability to adjust the phone to suit your needs. I also liked the light that comes on when the phone rings. Even if you can't hear the phone too well, the light makes it easy to know when the phone is ringing."
4,Good value; comfortable shirt.,"This is really meant to be a pajama shirt. However, I wear it outdoors on occaison. It is very comfortable. The top button is a bit low, so my chest shows through a little bit. Thus, I wear it mainly in the house or for very informal outings when the weather is hot. I bought it from Amazon for about $15 which I think is a great value."
5,Absolutely the Best,"I have read this book, It gives many insights to help a person cope in a tangled society we live in today. Patricia Lite Hickman's insight goes beyond rational thinking to guide you. This is a MUST READ Book !"
3,Pretty good,"I've heard some great covers in my time. This is okay. I do love the choice of instruments and the sound, but I think the covers choice could have been better. I would have loved ""When U Were Mine"" if Dump hadn't already done this so expertly, or even Cyndi Lauper. The other three aren't as good."
1,ugh,"Let me first say that I like CROOKED FINGERS. I have the two full lengths and a handful of those songs have managed to stay in my iTunes rotation for quite some time.""Resevoir Songs"" is a collection of covers which might sound interesting mixed in with a regular set of songs if played live in a small club on an off night...but they're hardly worth collecting on CD.I should've downloaded the samples first before buying, because I think these slow, Neil Diamond-esque covers are near dreadful. A real disappointment."
4,"a must-read for the F1 fan, less one star for bias","This is overall a very good and comprehensive history of the past 50 years in F1. In a year-by-year fashion the reader is able to follow how the world's fastest sport has evolved. A fascinating read in general and a must for every true F1 fan. Every decade is covered by a different expert guest writer, all of them great past and current champions of the sport, and this adds personal color, but also bias. David Coulthard of the McLaren-Mercedes Team covers the 90ies and of course gives his very personal perspective on the most recent seasons. The downside of the guest-writer format is a general loss in homogeneity that can't be avoided with this system. While the pictures are carefully selected and in part very stunning and excellent, some true gems of the past are sorely missed. It is very, very clear that this is a british book, and some of the other great European and South American drivers are not covered in as much depth."
5,Great for a personal diary or office use,"I've been using this diary for the past ten years. The size of the pages allows adequate space for recording my daily activities. I don't really use the cash account pages and the address section, but I can see they would be useful in an office setting. I use the diary for a personal record and those pages get used instead for recording my new year's resolutions and other notes.The binding is quite sturdy, so I don't worry about these coming apart like another brand that I used before. The diaries look great on a shelf with the date in gold on the spine."
1,did not receive product,never received product and can not get a real person on the phone at amazon.comHave used this product before and will again - just will walk in and buy in a store.
5,Very Objective,"Paz give us one of the most objective views of Mexico, with this text is possible to understand a real perspective of mexican history."
5,Ultimate valentine song,"I can't get Cassard's ""Ten thousand flowers"" out of my head, it's the ultimate valentine. His lyrics are inventive - I want to give you ten thousand flowers, I want to give you an emotional shower - my girlfiend said ""that's what every woman wants to hear from her man! If you still love the Beatles Rubber Soul through Abbey Road than you need to GET THIS!"
4,An Invaluable Resource!,"Margaret Busby's *Daughters of Africa* has become one of my favorite anthologies in my personal collection. The depth and breadth of her selections is inspiring, and I find myself revisiting its contents time and time again. It's a poet's dream and is excellent as any writer's reference. I have encountered new, engaging voices to explore as well as ancient ones whose lives were unknown me. Pick up a copy and dive in."
3,love the speakers,"Loved the price, this item is hard to find in IL. I like to thank the sender for sending it to me in a timly fashion."
2,Not what i expected,"One of the great things in life is the aroma of a newly opened bag of coffee. This bag doesnt smell like coffee, it smells burnt. Fortunately it doesnt taste burnt, but it doesnt taste that great either."
5,Nothing comes close,"I love coffee, i have tried so many in the past and happened upon the cafe altura. Now, every other coffee out there is just so-so. I occasionally give another recommended brand a chance but it never comes close to this one.When you open the bag the quality is clear: The smell is intoxicating - not fake like flavored coffees and not 'burnt' like starbucks, but rich full COFFEE flavor. Also, the beans are visually oily, not wet or nasty as i have heard of some coffees in the past but just shiny with the oil (where all the flavor is)Because of the quality of this coffee i use less, the taste will tempt you to take it black, and its organic from an ecologically-minded farmer....sweet!"
2,Sumatran Dark Roast,"The Sumatran Dark Roast beans were not dark colored (light brown) and it brewed a very weak cup of coffee nowhere in the ballpark of being considered a dark cup of joe. My bag was definitely mislabeled as the beans resembled something of a weak colombian roast. I have tried other roasts from Cafe Altura (San Francisco, Peruvian Dark) and they were decent roasts meeting the quality of the roast as advertised."
4,good stuff,"this is some of the best coffee I have ever drank. I like dark roast coffee, and this is very dark."
4,top notch coffee,"This organic, fair trade, shade grown coffee is excellent, and it improves mornings a great deal. Ordering it got a little confusing, and I can only hope that my next automatic order still stands, but that's a separate issue. The coffee itself is really good."
5,This has become my morning grind!,"Dark, earthy, smooth, sometimes velvety....this coffee is hard to beat at any price...but on Amazon with free shipping...it is the real deal! Oh, and its ""green"" ...you know organic, small farms, shade-grown,,,,etc."
3,Good but little bitter,Compared to Starbucks Sumatra. This is pretty close. However there is some bitter taste to it. So in summaryCafe Altura vs Starbucks SumatraFlavor : SameRichness : Sameno Bitterness : Starbuck wins
2,"So-so flavor, beans smell bad","If you want organic coffee, this is probably one of the cheapest you'll find. However, in this case you get what you pay for. The coffee was fresh and oily, and has an ok, but not great flavor. BUT the beans had a strong urine smell that was off-putting. The coffee did not smell like urine once brewed, but the smell of the unground beans was truly awful."
2,Coffee = Meh,"What's with the rave reviews? This stuff is tasteless. In addition, it is very weak. We had to add an extra 2 scoops to get the same strength as other coffees. As far as Sumatran coffees go, Starbucks blows this out of the water. Keep in mind that I hate everything about Starbucks, but until I find a better coffee I have to give in."
3,It's okay but not that great,I made a purchase because of the rave reviews of others. After few tried out I found it lacks the typical full body aroma of sumatra grown coffee beans which I'm so used to it. May be because it is organic therefore not so full of flavor.
3,"Just ""ok""","After all the rave reviews, I was a bit disappointed in this coffee. I'm cancelling after my second order."
2,"Bitter, bitter, bitter","I really wanted to like this coffee and based on the other reviewers' ratings I was eagerly awaiting my shipment. Unfortunately, for me this coffee although obviously super high quality is just too bitter in the brew for my taste. I ordered this on subscription for repeat delivery certain that I would like it as I am a Sumatran coffee drinker but after trying several different grinds and methods of brewing this I just do not like the bitterness in these beans."
1,"huge differences in between lots, used to be great, now horrible","I ordered this coffee the first time about a year ago, and it was amongst the best beans that ever passed through my Jura espresso maker. At the time the packaging also looked like the one shown on this picture (black).However, I since reordered twice, and in both cases the coffee has a horrible, burned aftertaste, probably from getting burned in the roasting process. This coincided with a change in the packaging style (which is now green). As a matter of fact, I am having a cup of it as I write this, and I can't wait for the beans to be finished so I can put something else into my machine again.NOT recommended as it is now! If you ask me, go with the ""Biodynamic"" (whatever that means...) French Roast instead, I just had that and is was GREAT!"
2,Not Good,"I bought this based on other reviews. Wow, I'm disappointed. Maybe, (let's give them the benefit of the doubt), I got a bad batch. I knew something was up when I opened the bag and smelled how skunky it was. Thought, hmm, that doesn't smell much like coffee. Not fresh roasted anyhow. Brewing in my Bialetti was a big disappointment. Tasted like it smelled, old socks. Weird aftertastes. I drink my coffee black so it is of course less forgiving. Perhaps one can get by with crutches to mask the flavor but it shouldn't be necessary. I'm going to cut this with espresso beans to mask the flavor somewhat and try not to feel to bad about my wasted purchase. Will not buy any of their products again."
3,average - by the way API is not new!,"This machine and this so called new technology has been out since fall of 2002 - almost 9 years agoThat's not new!If 9 yrs is new, when does new become old? Never?"
3,Banteay Srei- a brief glimpse,"This DVD goes for about 9 minutes, and doesn't provide much more than an overview of the site. It has some very general information about the temple but does not use specific art terms and is not for anyoone seeking this, it's more for a tourist market. It does have some good visuals, as Banteay Srei can be claustrophobic and difficult to take in when you are there, especially if there's lots of tourists. It's okay- if youy are a Cambodia nut like me,you will want to collect it, if not, it's not worth it."
1,Unstable at any speed,"I'm a huge Donald Pliner fan, but this shoe - while presenting an elegant appearance on your foot - is impossible to walk in safely. There is zero stability provided by the slender cross-straps and the teensy ankle strap, giving you no support to keep the foot from sliding clear off the shoe. These are fine if you're posing for a fashion shoot or simply standing around wearing foot jewelry, but I had to send them back for fear of spraining an ankle while simply walking. BTW, when I pruchased this shoe last month, Amazon's price was less than half the current price of $149. What's up with that?"
3,Not Bad.,"I bought this after hearing the one Jesus hitchhiking song (which I thought was hilarious), and at first I was a little disappointed. It's a good album, but maybe takes a little getting used to. I wasn't familiar with the artist and I had to listen to it several times to develop an affinity for many of the songs. One plus for me is that it has so many songs, since it's really two albums."
4,Street gang life in 1950's NYC,"Fascinating tale of a young Puerto Rican boy who was a member of ""The Hustlers"", a street gang in 1950's New York City. The book gives the reader a real flavor of what the Big Apple was like in that era, and what being an old school gansta was all about. When I bought the book, I thought it was about pool hustlers, which it wasn't, but I read it and enjoyed it immensely. Pulp fiction at its zenith."
5,this book is great,I think this book is great. I think this book should receive a silver medal to. In this book bad goblins take away Simon's cat and Jared's brother Simon. Jared and his sister have to go into the woods to find them. Theres a funny good goblin that helps them. This book has really good pictures. I recommend you read this book. It is really good like the first book The Field Guide. I can't wait for the third book.
4,Book Two...,This is book two of the Spiderwick Cronicles...---It's starts out with Jared and the others new found knowledge of the Fuild Guide and Thimbletacks warnings to get rid of it...but Jared refuses.When Simon goes outside he is caught and taken away by a invisible force...what you later find out to be goblins...on there journey to get there brother back they meet a hobgoblin who his caged and to be eaten by his own kind. Hogsqueal later gives all the Grace children the sight to see the faries and creatures around them without using the seeing stone.When Simon is saved they spot a wounded grifin and deside to take it home...since Simon is a animal lover and can't turn down a hurt animal. This is when the goblins presue the Grace children and the goblins become the least of there worries as they try to get home to safty...what other things are worse than goblins? I guess you'll have to read and find out.---This is one of my favorites in the series...I hope you read it!
3,Warning to cat lovers,"The Seeing Stone, like its predecessor, is a very short book. It took me roughly 20 minutes to start and finish this book. For younger readers, this is pretty ideal since many children are intimidated by longer books. Unfortunately, I thought the drawings of a cat roasting over a fire, along with mention of eating cats, kittens, and various other small creatures, to be more than a little disturbing. My family loves cats, and even though there's nothing very graphic in this book, both of my children (10 and 12) felt upset about the drawings and descriptions.Otherwise, my kids enjoy these quick-read books."
3,Good but too short,"The second installment of the 'Spiderwick Chronicles' is again very good.It has an engaging story, good characters and interesting ideas, as well as excellent illustrations. Probably deserving of four stars, but it's just too short. I really don't see the need to separate the story into five small books. I can see if they were catering to very young readers, but with a storyline involving family pets being roasted and eaten by goblins the target audience has to be 9-12 year olds not 5-8 year olds.Anyways well worth reading, but the series probably needs to be read all at once- at least for adult readers"
4,One of the best books ever,If you like mystery books this a good one.I had a good time reading this book because Simon got kid-napped by a goblin. My favorite part of this book is when Mallory and Jared found the griffen. So if you read this book you will find out if you like it or not.
4,COUNTRY IS NOT ROCKABILLY!!,"THIS SET HAS A FEW GEMS THAT I'D NEVER HEARD AND ACROSS THE BOARD IS A PRETTY GOOD COMPILATION. HOWEVER, I AM SICK AND TIRED OF GENIUSES WHO PUT ARTISTS IN THESE SETS WHO WOULD'NT KNOW ROCKABILLY IF IT JACKED THEM UPSIDE THE HEAD.I LIKE OLD COUNTRY, BUT WHEN I'M IN THE MOOD FOR OLD ROCKABILLY, I WANT TO HEAR SOME EARLY GENE VINCENT WITH CLIFF GALLUP,ELVIS WITH SCOTTY MOORE, CARL PERKINS,JOHNNY BURNETTE,AND ANY GREASER FROM THAT ERA WITH A SLAPPIN' BASS, A GREAT GUITAR RIFF, A STEADY RYTHM GUITAR, AND COARSE VOCALS RECORDED WITH THAT HAUNTING DELAY/ECHO EFFECT. THIS SET OFFERS THAT SOMEWHAT AND SETS LIKE THIS GIVES ME A CHANCE TO HEAR SOME GREAT UNKNOWN ARTISTS,BUT I FOUND MYSELF HITTING THE SKIP BUTTON TOO MUCH.UNTIL I DECIDE TO BUY A HISTORY OF COUNTRY MUSIC, KEEP THE FIDDLIN' COUNTRY OUT OF MY GREASE AND LEATHER ROCKABILLY!!"
2,BAD CD,"CLASSIC ROCKABILLY BOX SET, CD ITEM ""OH BABY BABE"", CD HAD LAST FOUR TRACKS BAD, WONT PLAY, ALL SCRATCHED ON TRACK SIDE. PURCHASED FROM BLOWITOUTAHERE, ???"
3,Dust off my knowledge,"I haven't studied math in a long time so I was looking for something on the kindle just to dust off my knowledge. I selected three different pre-algebra works, started reading the samples, and then selected this one as the approach which seemed the most well organized and explained. One of the other works was much more philosophical and not actually a beginner text, though it was on the subject of pre-algebra. The other text was very similar in purpose to this one, however the subject matter seemed to jump around in an order that was not as comfortable for me, and the explanations did not feel as complete. So in my extremely limited research, and having very little at stake apart from filling my free time, I'd suggest this as a good text for the subject."
2,list price is only $14.99,I currently have the book from my school library and the List price is $14.99. Why is the price posted as $75.00 new?
3,Brief Overview,This book is for overview. It cannot be a main book. But it can be used for revision purpose.
5,I have been obsessed with this play ever since I saw it live,"I am a theatre fanatic. With that said, I am ashamed that when a date took me to see the play Two Trains Running (at the Aliance Theatre in Atlanta) in the mid 90's, I had never heard of the play or the playwright.After the lights came on after a stellar performance, I literally couldn't say anything accept how good the play was. (Maybe that is why I never heard from the guy again - haha) I have become obsessed with this play!I know that reading it will not be exactly the same ... but one owes it to themselves to at least read this very powerful piece of art.I love it! I love it!"
3,It's a play,"I didn't see this in the official review, so I'm just going to put that it's a review in case that matters to you. I'm getting this for Summer reading and it's the shortest from the list :-p"
3,Deep Stuff,The characters of Memphis and Hambone have nothing to hide is there search for what the white man owes them. Wilson may have over done it on the symbolism for some but I found it fascinating.
5,wargaming,This is great for wargaming and diorama building but not suited for children. You get alot for your money. You can build your armies quickly and they're easier to paint then the metal 15mm. I also bought the artillery and the 205 piece sets.
1,Disappointed,I thought the figures were going to be bigger and my son was very disappointed. Would love to return it but he opened the box
5,Awesome!,"Finally! A book that is intelligent, naughtily funny, utterly readable, and absolutely entertaining. Thank you Jane! There are sentences in it that filled me with envy...how could she think of that? And how did she find the perfect way to express it? If I had the financial wherewithal and connections, it would now be on its way to becoming a movie...why not?"
3,The Clans have turned wuss...,"Well, the Inner Sphere bias has turned amazing in the new book. Not only are Elementals suddenly becoming easier and easier to defeat (as opposed to not being stopped by a medium laser in their first appearance, and massive trauma being an ignorance!) but of course the Clan OmniMechs and fearsome Warships are now also easy to defeat, and they don't even THINK of getting off a message...However, I would recommend this book if you want some political views...who is trying to stop the Task Force? And why?"
3,"A good book, but not a great one","This book, while exciting, definetly shows the inner sphere bias of all the recent books. The battle is laughable in the stupidity of the Clan commander. I mean, the Comguards can be excused for not having anyting resembling tactics, but the clans have been fighting Warship battles for centuries. Still, it's got some good action, and also points out the weakness of the inner sphere to treachery, something that has been neglected recently. A far better book than freebirth, but not as good as it should have been. Skip freebirth and read this."
4,"Great, you are learning Gressman","Well, I could not rate it 5 stars, it was not all that, but it was an excellent addition to the Battletech book universe. Gressman had the honor of writing about a space battle, which gives us a new look at the Battletech wars. All though the first few pages were ful of boring training and the book had no interesting 'Mech combats, Gressman can really write a book."
3,Marred by Author's Mistakes,"If this novel wasn't such a central part of the TotC series I would hesitate to recommend it. The pleasure I got from this novel was seriously marred by the multiple mistakes I discovered. Space prohibits me from pointing out more than the two worst: The route of Task Force serpent is supposed to be top secret yet the map shows it drops by at the capital system of the Outworlds Alliance. Second, the DEST boarding action was laughable (and unnecessary) and really made me wish the author had bothered to think it through what close combat in zero-G would be like. To be fair, if you do not have an indepth knowledge of the BT universe or can otherwise overlook the mistakes the novel is undoubtedly enjoyable. My rating is an average between the two viewpoints (3 and 7)."
3,Good but not great,"This book, though not as good as the others in the series will need to be read, however if you are a fan of Micheal Stackpole you will find that this book drags a bit. One of the things that I did like about the book was that the author was one of the first to give the DEST teams their due. To often in recent Battletech novels they have been easily defeated, they ARE supposed to be among the most vaunted warriors of the Inner Sphere. To summarize, though this will undoubtedly be among the worst of the series it is a necessary read. To be the worst novel in a series of outstanding novels is not the end of the world."
1,Gressman manages to destroy the flow of the campaign.,"It started out wonderful. I mean a whole series dedicated to the battle with the clans on one major final awe inspiring campaign. Sounds like the basis for a wonderful series that would keep you entertained throughout the whole 9 books right? Sorry gressman. you blew it. Gressman first bores you with pages upon pages of endless detail about training and preperation.. then bores you with incredible depth of one space battle. about 80 pages for one battle is a bit much i have to say. It is a very slow paced book that allmost gives you whiplash after reading books of stackpoles nature, which are non stop action and intrigue that even thou they dont go into detail about single actions.. they do keep you entertained. This book does not."
4,The cover's the best part of the book!,"I liked this one in the Twilight of the Clans series. The cover's the best part of the book, with it's beautifully rendered Raven crashing through the woods.The story moves along well, though drags out a bit in the emotions of the characters who don't die. At the risk of sounding sexist, I'd almost think this one was written for the fairer sex, rather than we bloodthirsty mechwarriors! <grinning>The dying begins in this novel, but there's not nearly enough, and it's disappointingly handled as well. This one's a good read, and a must read, but Gressman could have done better."
1,Avoid if you can,"This book is not so good. 2 things that I find really disturbing:* a lot of the words in the vocabulary are unlikely to be used by someone new to the language. Instead of learning the word for ""clothes""(very basic vocabulary) you learn the word ""overcoat"", which is allready a compound word of the words ""big"" and ""clothes"" (but they don't tell that!).* the grammer used is too complex in the beginning. You will encounter phrase constructions that are impossible to understand, until you come at some part way further in the book.My advise: really avoid this book, it makes learning Chinese more difficult than it should."
2,One of the poorer Chinese language texts,"There is very little I can recommend about this book. It is an introductory text, but the first lesson introduces words like Lu3you2ju2 (the Tourist Bureau) that are not only difficult for the beginner to pronounce, but also aren't necessarily considered essential introductory vocabulary. Rather than teaching the language from the ground up, each chapter focuses on specific situations, such as ""Welcome,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Looking for Someone,"" ""To the Post Office,"" etc. While this may be handy as a language travel guide, it is not conducive to effective language acquisition. The end result is frustration on the part of the student. Avoid this book if you can."
2,Still have not received it,I ordered this map over a month ago and still have not received it. Did it get lost in the mail?
5,I Love This Book!,"I'm new at scrapbooking and this is a great book which inspired me to set goals for myself! It offers ideas from beginners to advanced, and I'm definately going to try my hand at some of the advanced! It also gives wonderful descriptions of what you should and shouldn't use in a scrapbook. Plus, it helps you to decide what direction to go in for specific themes! Everyone who scrapbooks should own this book!"
3,a good starting point you'll quickly pass,"This book has good advice and very nice illustrations. But it suffers from trying to do too many things and none of them in sufficient depth. I do like the pages shown, but the book doesn't have enough illustrations to be a really useful source of inspiration -- you'd be better off with one of those ``515 Ideas'' or ``200 Layouts'' books or a website. As for its tips on how to use products, all you really need to grasp is that you should use archival materials, and after that you'll learn more in half an hour just browsing through the products at any decent-sized crafts store. I strongly recommend reading this book, but -- well, does Amazon allow us to suggest borrowing from the library?"
3,Good intro book (not for the experienced scrapbooker),This book is a good intro into scrapbooking but if you have read this magazine for any length of time you will recognize many of the examples and much of the content.
5,great tech without any filler,"What I love about this little-known band from St. Louis is that there is no musical genre that they will not try. Lye By Mistake mixes up metal, jazz, calypso, blues, tehcno, noise, industrial, etc, etc., sometimes in one song! And they have a virtuoso guitarist who rivals Chris Arp from Psyopus! If you are into technical metal or even experimental music, you will be all over this."
4,"if you like technical/spastic metal with a little jazz, etc.","If you like technical/spastic metal with a little jazz, etc., then these guys will be right up your alley. If you hate that kind of music, you might want to look elsewhere. Fans of John Zorn, Dillinger Escape Plan, Mr. Bungle, The Locust, etc. will enjoy. The songwriting is completely odd and the musicianship is nothing short of astounding."
2,Faulty CTG 12 ft 3.5MM Stereo Audio Extension Cable (13788),"Cable had very high resistance, and an intermittent male connector. Marginal at best even if male connector had not been intermittent."
1,Do Not Buy,"This product had a terrible connection. It would change the sound (extreme volume changes) with the slightest movement.Bottom Line: Crap Product, do not buy."
2,One works and the other doesn't.,"I ordered 2 of these. One of them works fine. The other requires a lot of wiggling, and I'm not sure if it's the cable or connector."
1,junk,"junk!!JUNK JUNK garbage do not purchase, connection is very touchy!! on and off!! why are there a certain number of words required for this feed back area!? Stupid!"
5,Part of my audio cable empire at home,"This long audio cable works fine to enable mo 'reach out' to distant earphones, audio sources, etc. Feel I should get a few more!"
1,bad quality,I liked the fact it had length to it but it starting cutting out after just 2 weeks of use.
1,Not recommended - died within one month,"I was concerned when I first received this cable that it did not ""feel right"". Within a month, the cable started acting up and now I will have to purchase another (not this one). Recommend you spend a little more money to get the quality."
4,Very long and usfull,I recently orderd an mp3 player from china and when i got the ear buds that i orderd seperate they had rich bass and sound quality the only problem was that they were 3.5 mm and I'm 6 ft 2 so i was very dissapointed when i found i had to hold them up to my chest to get them to work which was a hassle to say the least!! I did some checking online and found out that there where some head phone extensions and I found them at amazon for less then [...] i orderd them and they work great now i can listen to my 7 doller ear buds that i also got from china that offer the same quality if not better than the ones that retail for over [...] here in the states!!! I highly recommend them they work great for my noise cancellation ear buds there is no static and they are a great value thanks amazon for being my one stop solution fix.
4,good,"Its a good cable, but at times it can be a little fuzzy if no sound is going through it. If music is playing you cant even notice it though."
3,Sadly they didn't work.,"I received these, and tried to connect up my computer speaker surround sound. Sadly the jaces were the wrong type, and the did not work for the purpose i baught them for. This is my bad, because I did not realize I needed RCA jacks. I tried to see if they would work for my headphones as an extention, again wrong jack size. I will keep them instead of sending them back, because I figure that I can use them sometime or someplace in the furture. It was only a $4.00 mistake so I am not going to fret about it. I'll just chalk it up to leasons learned to check the right kacks next time."
5,Great extension for headsets,The connection is tight so there are no sound cutouts. Wish I'd ordered two at the same time. Would recommend this item to anyone needing more length.
1,Don't buy,"Plugged the cable in as a headphone extension cable. The audio was garbled, and unuseable. Sounded like it was in a box, and distorted. I plugged my headset back into to my iPad without the extension cable, and everything was fine. Is it worth the $2.56 I paid for the cables, to hassle with sending them back? I threw them in the trash. I will not buy again from this company. It's obvious they were never tested, no quality control. I would rate them 0 Stars, but this review doesn't allow it."
5,No Complaints,"I needed a headphone extension so that i could move around my cubicle at work while plugged in to my computer without having my headphones ripped out of my ear continuously. This extension cord does the trick. It does what I bought it to do, so it gets 5 out of 5 stars."
5,Inexpensive Yet Good Quality,"I purchased this audio extension cable from Bargain Cable. They were not the least expensive, but to me a customer satisfaction rating that's two to three points higher is worth an extra nickel or dime.I've used Cables To Go products before. This is a good quality cable: the cable itself is thick enough that it won't be damaged during normal use, the connectors are well molded, and the strain reliefs are generous. It's not gold plated, 'tis true, but that's mostly a gimmick anyways.Five stars because the price to quality ratio is such a high value. Any retail electronics store is going to charge about four to five times as much for a similar quality product."
1,Great while it worked.,"Purchased this product one month ago and the right channel has already stopped working. This cable does nothing but sit on my desk and extend my headphones to my computer, so it's not like I'm doing anything strenuous with it.Spend an extra $5 and get yourself a cable that will last longer than 30 days. Don't buy this junk."
1,You get what you pay for...,"Upon using this 12ft headphone extension cord I noticed a MAJOR loss in sound quality. I used the cord in several ways, including headphone jacks in my guitar effects processor, television, and computer; all of which suffered terrible sound quality. Also, the audio quality worsens as the cord is moving around. This cord is essentially useless to me. Cheap extension cord delivers cheap quality; look elsewhere."
1,Junk - Do Not Buy,"I saw mixed reviews and decided to take the $2 gamble. Apparently some of these work just fine, while others are garbage. Mine works, but only when the plugs are rotated a certain way. Even the slightest touch disrupts the connection and leaves me with static until I readjust. Not very practical. So in other words, I got the garbage. My advice? Spend the extra couple of dollars for a product you know will work."
1,do not buy this cable!,I bought this cable because the last one I purchased was bunk. This one turned out the exact same. The sizing is floozy and the cable is cheap.-
2,You get what you pay for!,"Sound carries through cable about half of the time. I need to jostle and adjust the ends of the cables constantly, and often times hear only static. Very cheaply made."
1,"Cheap Price, Cheap Cable","You get what you pay for I suppose. Cheap Price, Cheap Cable. I purchased 2 of these cables and they both have static and short out. They didn't last more than a month. I would recommend purchasing a higher quality cable for just a little more cost. Don't go cheap with this cable. I would not recommend this to a friend."
5,no problems,"The twelve feet is very convenient for me with my devices being so far apart. It works great, nothing defective after a month of use."
1,Bad Quality,"While the shipping was fast, the price was decent, and the product seemed okay, when actually used there is a major loss of sound quality."
2,Poor Quality,I`ve had this 3.5mm cable all of 2.5 months and it quit working! How does a ext. head phone cable go bad after limited use and perfect care? The internal conductor wire must be broke on the female end! Just WONDERFUL!! I would not recommend this cable to any one!!
1,You get what you payfor,"Cables To Go CTG 12ft 3.5MM STEREO AUDIO EXTENSION CABLE M/F ( 13788 )It would have been nice if the wire gauge had been included in the product description. This was the cheapest cable available. It has to be the flimsiest cable ever made. Considering that I purchased it for a cable headphones extension, it's life expectancy is not so good."
1,Doesn't work with my stereo equipment,The problem with buying anything online is it is difficult to actually ascertain whether or not it will work as expected. These are 3.5mm just as my system but they sure don't work with it!I'll be looking around to find ones that do.I will say that they were processed and shipped quickly and arrived in a padded envelope so were in great shape. They were inexpensive so it is unlikely that I'll bother with a return.
1,BAD qunlity,"IF there have a 0 star, I will choose it!Bad qunlity bad shipping speed, u can not hear any thing when plug ur headhone in this product."
1,Buy somewhere else,"This cable is cheaply made and sure enough, it started crackling horrible not long after I started using it.Short review but what else is there to say. I am off to replace this junk with a better cable."
3,For thoes who can comprimise.,It's not bad. It's lengthy made of cheap plastic and it works. the issue is within the male and female ends. the male end fits loosely into sockets and the female end doesnt feel very secure. this leads to an occasional screw up in the sound. if the cable gets knocked around a little and the end comes loose ull notice. it works for someone just looking for a quick and simple fix but if your trying to hold a more professional end this might not be it.
1,Noticeably Quieter,"I bought this inexpensive cable in hopes that I could have one of my Bose speakers on either side of my bed. The cable that came with the two Bose speakers was not long enough. Bought this, and immediately noticed that one speaker was louder than the other. I removed this cable and used the original one and it was perfect again. It's more hassle for me to send this back for a refund than it's worth, or else I would.I find it peculiar that there are so many good reviews of this cable."
3,"NOT A REVIEW, BUT AN OPINION.","Now that Gamera vs Viras (The alternate title for this movie) has been released, and with an english voice track, I see very little reason get this version. Unless of course the commentary track is your prime concern. If this winds up in the `new and used` at a much lower price I may consider buying it. Afterall I do have Retromedia's Other Gamera movie Return Of The Giant Monsters (Gamera vs Gyaos) Like I said this is only an opinion and will probably be deleted in a few weeks or months."
4,"Believe it is ""good"" not bootlegged","[...] According to cryptomundo (go to link) this is not a dubbed or pirated version, but the expected release (as implied above). Go to article to read interview with Carl Craig."
1,"Unauthorized, illegal release","Do not buy this DVD! It's an unauthorized bootleg of the film. The official, high-quality release of the film can be bought from Shout Factory in September, also here on Amazon (search for Gamera vs. Viras)."
5,Best Compilation of Robert Earl Keen's Songs Ever!,"This albun has it all. It has softer songs and fast, upbeat songs. The variety of songs and the fact that they don't all sound the same as do a lot of other CDs really make this album great. All of Mr. Keen's work is fantastic and comes from real-life experiences. Most of his greatest hits are on this CD except for Copenhagen and The Front Porch Song. This is a great CD that EVERY Texas Music lover should own. I also suggest that after purchasing this one that you also purchase The Live Album which contains Copenhagen and The Front Porch Song. If you are already a REK fan, then I strongly suggest that you purchase an album by Pat Green, another great Texas songwriter/singer."
5,Excellent Texas Country-Rock,"I first heard ""The Road Goes on Forever"" on a Highwaymen album, but a friend from Texas played the original from this album for me. I immediately purchased it solely for that song. I was surprised to find that the entire album contains beautifully written and performed songs, both humorous and poignent. His laid-back attitude and repoire with the crowd make it all the more enjoyable. A perfect CD for the country, folk, or rock listener."
2,I was duped,"I like Robert Earle Keene Jr.I have 3 or 4 of his disks.Most of which are HDCD or SACD, and sound great.Some how I was led to believe this disk was a high bit rate offering.It was not.It is a live album, not what I considered his best effort, or best recording.Others may disagree, but if you are new to REK Jr, he has many MUCH better soundingdisks available.Die hard fans might like it."
2,Disappointing.,"I don't usually care for live recordings, Simon and Garfunkel in Central Park being an exception. I bought this thinking it might be something new and fresh and frankly don't care for it. Keen has done some great stuff. This isn't it. Sorry...just doesn't ring true enough for me."
5,Extraordinary music by an extraordinary artist,"I don't think that five stars can quite show my feelings toward this CD. It is by far one of the best CD's I own, and that is tough for me to admit, because I usually hate this genre of music. Robert Earl Keen has a great ability to perform live. The crowd is enthusiastic, and they sing along quite often. His story telling ability is also amazing. This CD deserves more stars than I can count."
4,A Great Live Album,If you like Americana & Folk music you will love Robert Earl Keen. He has a way to draw you into the songs and make you feel like you are there. The stories he tells before some of the songs make them extra special. By all means if you are a REK Fan this is a no-brainer. Classic Robert Earle!My favorites:The Road Goes on Forever (also great version from Joe Ely & The Highwaymen) This is a great twisted love song.Dreadful Selfish Crime - A great reflection song with wonderful lyrics.Mariano - A wonderful haunting ballad.I'm Coming Home - Another great love song.Happy Listening!
5,One of the bests....,"Robert Earl Keen is not just one of the best Texas singer/songwriters, he one of the greatest in the world. And his ability to put on a great live show is proven in this cd.""No. 2 Live Dinner"" is one of my favorite cds. It's got all the great REK songs on it, ""Gringo Honeymoon"", ""Dreadful Selfish Crime"", ""I'm Coming Home"" and ""Five Pound Bass"". Plus it's got the hilarious holiday tune, ""Merry Christmas From the Family"" and the song Keen is best known for ""The Road Goes on Forever"". Also on the cd is Keen's story of how Willie Nelson and the Highwayman endedup recording that song, which will keep you laughing!!!This is packed start to finish with great songwriting, whether it's the fast pace ""I'm Going to Town"" or the slow ballad ""Mariano"" It's a great d that any true music fan will enjoy!!"
4,"artful, subtle, and deeply moving. painfully readable","When I was 30 pages from the end of this book, a with whom I was traveling tapped me on the arm to get my attention. I turned to look at her, but I had no idea who she was, how we knew each other, or where we were. I was in the boat with the Old Man. Although the book is an easy and fast read, there is much depth and subtlety to the story and the writing. Like some of Mozart's music, it looks easy to understand until you try to fully understand it. Then it's obvious that there's much much more than you first thought."
1,"Not Enough ACTION, it drags on and on and on.","In the beginning, the book was fairly decent but when Santiago was out at sea and caught the ""big fish"", I realized it was losing its point. It didnt keep me interested."
3,This was a fairly good book.,"This book had a very interesting beginning,though it lost it's point at the end.The part were he was in the sea when he caught the fish was the climax, then it started loosing it's main point."
2,Too much detail.,"This book was horrible if you ever have the chance not to read it take that oppertunityI am sure all of the allegores have some meaning, and mabye i am too young to see this but i hated it."
3,Review of The Old Man and The Sea,"The reason I rated this book a three, was because overall I thoght it was a good book. Though I didn't like the way the author wrote it. He went through the whole book saying how the old man caught the fish, and he wrote how it took him three days just to get the fish to give up, and when he got it, it was the biggest fish he had ever gotten. The reason I didn't like this was because the old man's fish got half ate on the way home. It was probably very disappointing for the man not being able to bring the huge fish home to show the boy. Although he did bring it home but half of the fish was gone. That seems very disappointing to me. One thing I liked, or thought was neat was that the author could sit and write about the man catching a fish and make it interesting throghout the whole entire book. These were my thoughts on The Old man In The Sea."
5,Hemingway,"The salmon is not unique in its struggle to survive as Hemingway illustrates in his captivating novel The Old Man and the Sea. The novel was Hemingway's best work and was most likely written during his less verbose alcoholic period.If the goal is to educate and enlighten as opposed to bore senseless one might consider The Old Man and the Sea for a novel study complete with similes, metaphors and symbolism."
2,Insert burst second time I wore it.,It burst the second time I wore it. I ended up soaked and hot. My mom had one a few years ago and hers did well but this was a disappointment - especially since it really helped.
1,Crap...,"Don't bother! It works okay but it is tiny, the ice packs rupture very easily and it's not worth what you are paying for. Spend the extra and go with a cryo-max gel pack that lasts for hours... this gives you minutes"
4,"Montell Jordan's - ""Get It On Tonight""","The host of Motown Live has proved to top the R&B singles chart a number of times, including with his latest single ""Get It On Tonight"". Hits like ""Let's Ride"" and his catchy anthem ""This Is How we Do It"" shows that this Pepperdine University graduate has the skill to dominate the music charts. Despite the success of Montell Jordan's latest single: his lyrics as well as visuals for the video for ""Get It On Tonight"" can be viewed as eyebrow raising by some R&B and crossover pop chart audiences. However he maintains to sing decently along true R&B lines as well as possessing accompanying catchy groovy beats which can win people to the dance floor.Overally, Montell Jordan's single ""Get It On Tonight"" receives a Kenny rating of B-."
5,The JAM!!!!!!,At all the parties and played on my block and this is a song that will always sound great no mater how old it gets!! THIS IS HOW WE DO IT!!! In LA!!!
