2,Refilled not remanufactured,"Worked fine for about 25 to 30 pages, printed documents began to smug. Tried to clean but the main roller was obviously worn on both edges and probably should have been replaced. I believe this cartridge was just refilled not remanufactured."
1,Empty cartridges HP 4050 toner,I bought 2 cartridges for my HP 4050. When I put the 1st one in I got a low toner message and within 3 pages and parts of the page did not print. I put the 2nd cartidge in an got a message out of toner and could not print anything. I left a VM with the company.
5,"Durable, laminated, and very useful!","This is an extremely durable and laminated 8 1/2 X 11 card that contains nearly any grammar rule that you might need to know. It is pre-punched so that you can carry it around in a three ring binder with you. I have had my Latin Grammar Card for many years and it's still in great shape! Yes, you can certainly find any of these grammar rules on the Internet for free, but can you condense them all down so that they fit on a 2 sided card? It won't replace a good Latin grammar book, but it is definitely easier to carry and will certainly help you tell your declensions from your conjugations!"
3,Woah man,"First and foremost, how in the world these guys can be considered punk is BEYOND me. I am a devout ""metalhead"" and am just now discvering hardcore music, and this has got to be some of the HARDEST HEAVIEST metal ive hve ever heard. THe album exudes agression and is just plain a good time"
3,a mix of intrigues,"As is her practice, Murdoch starts the novel with a dialogue among the characters making the reader to find out the relevant context.Too many characters disturbed in one way or the other compel the reader to go back in the story to find the link. The novelist's description of the chacters'views on God, Good and Reality compels admiration because, the tendency of the human being in this technological era is also not to arrive at a sane conclusion immediately on morals or philosophy.The moral and philosophical concerns of Iris murdoch in this novel are too heavy to grasp initially. As the work progresses, the reader realises the need for some soul searching to understand the relationships.The characterisation of Crimond and the homo-sexual relations of characters like Gerard, Jenkin etc provide much food for thought.The novel set in midsummer ends with the spring time of happiness in the life of Gulliver and Lily."
2,Close but no cigar,"I purchased these mats as winter replacment mats for my Cadillac. I wanted to keep the original mats with the Cadillac Crests from getting damaged during the winter months. Salt mud snow etc. The quality of these ""premium"" mats is good but nowhere near the factory mats cushion and feel as described on the site. Also the color matching left something to be desired. Mine were at least 4 shades darker than the factory ones that match the carpet exactly (as you would expect from the factory). The fit however is good almost a perfect match to the originals. Bottom line, I could have paid half the price for the same quality mats at any auto parts store."
1,The title is better than the book,"First this is written in British English. It takes some getting used to and some terms and customs are different.Moreover this is a very brief book.Further it is full of samples which one can obtain from elsewhere and are not a good teaching aid. If I say such and such said this and it was very effective, it does not help me if I am not shown how to duplicate that effort.Ofcourse if you are British this may be just the book for you. For the rest of the English speaking people look elsewhere.For Desi's I have started a Blog at[FatheroftheDesiBride]because our culture is so unique yet English is a very common language for us because of our colonial history."
5,~*~BaNnEr In ThE sKy ~*~,"This book isn't half bad. Some of the character descriptions are juss plan stupid though like ""Klauss Wesslehoft"" is described as a broad young man with hands like hams fresh from the butcher...The book has a good plot though and is totally worth a read. Don't waste your time watching the movie though is juss plain bad! :("
3,Im 12 and I just felt like reviewing this..,"Well, in my school we had to pick out from a pile of books what book we want to report on. I picked this one, read in one weak, and it wasnt too bad. I mean it wasnt great or anything and it wasnt horrible it was like a sit back and relax book. Also I would not buy it because it wasnt that good, if you want to read it, i would just get it at the library. Also I wrote this review because I was bored."
1,I am barfing right now!,This book SUCKED!!!!!!It's sooooooooo boring. It's so bad that I have already reviewed it but I feel the need to do it again. It's that bad!! Please believe me when I say DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!! I am the only sane one that has reviewed it so far as you can clearly observe above in fact I think that that was the author himself disguised as one of his readers just to scam people into buying his book. Take my advice...this book will make you want to hurl.
5,A Wonderful Story,"I thought this book was very good. The end was very surprising, and clever. I would recommend you read it!"
5,Greatest Book Ever!,"My friend told me that Banner in the Sky is a very good book, well I'm here to vouch for that. Banner in the Sky is the most intriguing story I have ever read. James R. Ullman's book is about a legend, named Josef Matt, whose son is determined to climb the mountain that Josef died on. If Rudi Matt can do this, if he can climb the Citadel, he will be the first one ever to climb it. But in all good stories there's a catch, Rudi's mom and uncle won't let him climb the mountain because of his father's death. Plus Rudi is not built to climb! Along the way Rudi meets Captain John Winter, the best climber of his day. The Captain gives Rudi his chance to climb, but will he? Banner in the sky is a gut-wrenching story about sheer will and determination. My recommendation, simple, if you ever have had parental problems (and I know you have) then this is your book!"
4,Tabitha,"The book I read was called Banner in the Sky. It's about a boy named Rudi Matt.Rudi lives in Switzerland in a place called Kurtal.Rudi is sixteen years old.He work at the Beau Site hotel.When ever he gets the chance he slithers out like a snake, and goes to the place where his father Josef Matt died.Rudi wants to fallow his fathers steps and climb the Citadel."
5,Tyler Wilson,"I liked Banner in the Sky because it's about Rudi trying to climb a mountain. He is only 16 years old and it is a mountain that no one has ever climbed before. His Dad died on the Mountain. The book has a lot of adventure and action. The author includes his own passion for climbing in the book, mostly in Rudi's character. There was conflict between characters because some thought that climbing was ""everything"" while others disagreed. The ending was unexpected."
5,100% Super Book,"This book is the best one I have read in months.This book has a lot of action in it, and has suspence on almost every page.This is a great book for people of all ages!"
4,Book Review,"Banner in the Sky is one of the best books I have ever read. James Ramsey Ullman is a very talented author and his use of discriptive words is amazing. All the challenges that Rudi must face and the amazing truth about the true conquerors of the Citadel make this book all the more thrilling. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves thrills, excitement, and amazing scenery."
3,Banner in the Sky,"I thought this book was okay. It was scary when Rudi was in the cave with a ghost. It made me laugh when Old Teo was talking about Mt. Dishpan. The ending really surprised me when Rudi didn't make it to the top of the Citadel, but I was glad that the red shirt did. I would recommend this book to people who like to hike and climb."
1,Banner in the sky,This book was boring but exiting at times like when Rudi the main character lied to his mom to go outside and climb the Citadel to avenge his father who failed to climb the Citadel. Although this book was very annoying to me it isn't my usual gender choice. I think that millions of other people with tons of other opinions on this novel will like it especially if they enjoy a sci-fi fantasy.
2,please don't read.,"This book is .......terrible. I love reading but I found my mind wandering and dreading going to bed because I would have to read banner in the sky. This book needs more bad reviews that warn people. I honestly don't see how any person, let alone the kids from my generation who have to be entertained every minute, could enjoy this. This is about a kid who wants to climb a mountain because his dad died trying to climb it. Sound mildly interesting right? Wrong! Somehow the author manages a story where *nothing* happens. Just skip this and read one of the thousunds of children's books that are better than this."
5,Luke D.,It was one of the best books I have ever read. It was great. It started out with Rudi wanting to climb a mountain called the Citadel in honor of his father's death. His mother won't let him because of his father. I really liked how his uncle and dhis mother finally let him climb it. I recommend this book for everybody.
4,Banner in the Sky,"I think this book was excellent and I liked how Uncle Franz Lerner did finally change his attitude toward Rudi about climbing the Citadel. And I value Rudi's courage for his expedition on climbing the Citadel in Switzarland and climbs it for his unfinshed quest from his father who died on the Fortress helping Sir Edward stay alive. Especially Old Teo who helps Rudi to go out on his mountain climbing even if his mother and Uncle want him to become a successful business man, Teo knew that it was not meant to be. So I encourage you to read, ""Banner in the Sky"" for it shows real courage and what you really want in your heart or mind to happen."
3,review,this is a easy book to read but it is a very interesting book toit is based on a kid who wants to folow his fathers dreams and climb the citadel to prove his a real mountaineer.by:chris brown
2,this book has no point.,I read like crazy. I can finish a book this long in one night. Instead it took me 4. This book is pointless. I like rock climbing but this has almost nothing to do with it. It just talks about how this boy is sad. His mom is sad. He wants to climb the mountain. His mom does not because she is afraid. He climbs it anyway. The mountain is big. The mountain is there. This has got to be one of the most pointless books I have ever read. It rivals summer of the swans. A cereal box label is more exciting because at least then you can be disgusted by what they put in you food. I highly recomend skipping this book. Do yourself a favor and read something more interesting.
5,"A great book of courage, heart, and ditermenation.","Rudi Matt is a boy living in the Alps, near the Citadel the only unconquered peak in the alps. 1 Man dared to reach it, Rudi's father, who died going up. Rudi's mom is afraid of losing him, so she doesn't let him climb. Rudi knows how to climb it though, and he finally gets his chance. This is an awsome book that you must read. It's got both adventure and hope, courage and ditermination, altogether, you want to read it."
4,Interesting book full nice propaganda,"Taschen did a nice effort collecting this artwork. Theres hundreds of paintings here, at some point I would have preferred a taller book instead a thickerbook, but quality is good!"
3,A Good General Use Bible,"This bible is very adequate for general use. The NIV is very easy to read and uses common languages. This is very good except for it alters classic passages and at times doesn't represent the poetic quality of the original texts adequately. It's print is pretty small but easy to get used to. Red lettering of Christ's words is very helpful. This bible tends to translate words favoring the Conservative-Evangelical views. All in all I would recomend this bible for the casual reader. If you want a study bible check out the Concordia Self Study Bible, a Lutheran NIV bible, or the Access Bible which uses the NRSV translation, which tends to be more literal in the tradition of the King James bible. I give the Bible 3 stars."
4,A Good Bible for Reading,"The New International Version of the Bible is used by many evangelical groups and conservative protestant denominations. It is very readable but alters classic passages to do this. It is a good Bible for reading, but has limited footnotes, and they are repetative. For study though, I would recommend the New Revised Standard Bible because of its balance of poetic quality of that in the original manuscripts and the meaning of the passages.Overall I give the NIV a four star rating."
1,dangerous game,the service was great. arrived on time in good condition.just didn't care for the movie.
5,One of Madonna's best....,"Okay, I admit it, I'm an unashamed Madonna fan. I watch all of her movies and enjoy most of them. I do have to admit that some performances have been slightly 'raw', but in Dangerous Game, she shines brightly.This is definitely an arthouse movie. You would need to enjoy indi and arthouse movies to appreciate this movie.Dangerous Game has the motif of 'movie within a movie'....we see a movie being made and the behind the scenes footage.In my opinion this is Madonna's finest acting performance. She brings so much to the character to give a mutlilayered performance.Not just for Madonna fans - for all who enjoy indi/arthouse movies that make you think...."
2,"sadly, one of madonna's best performances","Sadly this film is barely watchable, yet it is probably Madonna's best performance. She seems natural, with fluid movements and real emotion. You may however have to watch the moments that she's not on screen with your thumb glued to the fast forward button. The rest of the film is a banal mess, seemingly edited with a chainsaw. Good luck!"
2,sucked,This movie was recommended to me threw amazon. I like Madonna so I bought this movie a few months ago. I didn't get around to watching it till today. And I have to say this movie sucks.... in the worst way. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because of Madonnas emotional acting. I think she did a good job. Other wise it would have gotten one star. If I am able to I would have gave it no stars.
1,Like A Travesty,"Alarming, awful, horrid, terrible, and appalling are the best words to describe this movie; but even this cannnot fully describe its utter atrociousness. Madonna has made many bad pictures but this is absolutely bar-none hands down the very worst of the very worst. I'd rather watch the bars on stripes on TV than see this again. I believe it was the late Gene Siskel that called this movie, ""overwrought baloney."" Very true. Since it was too horrible to get released in a movie theater (at least not in the NY area) I had to wait until ""Dangerous Game"" went to video to see it. The overall plot is supposed to be some big dramatic story about a movie taken place within a movie. It's just very poorly produced and the plot moves around quicker than Madonna does on stage. Unless you're a huge Madonna fan that has to see everything she does skip ""Dangerous Game."""
4,DON'T SEE THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!,"Dangerous Game is a brilliant work of modern cinema and I think it was clever for director Abel Ferrara to use the most contreversial and beautiful woman in the industry, Madonna. She gave a terrific performance as Sarrah Jennings. If you rent this, make sure you see the rated R version instead of the unrated because I bought this movie pre-viewed from a video store (the director's cut) and it was so explicit...there were x2 the violence, sexuality and nudity. This movie needs to be seen by Madonna fans to prove she can act very well."
1,Didn't enjoy the movie.,"I kept wondering when the movie was going to end. It had very little, and very uninteresting plot."
3,"not horrible, not great","I bought this movie because Harvey Kietel is in it and I find him very appealing for some reason. The movie is about making an independant movie. Harvey is the director who tries to get the best performances out of his actors, besides dealing with everyone's ego's and trying to keep the peace at home with his wife. I liked it, the acting was sincere, even Madonna seemed to get into her character, rather than just being ""Madonna"" in a movie. I really shouldn't make bad comments about her, she's had a most successful career and has made millions, so obviously she knows what she's doing. I wish I could do the same."
2,"Lead actress is quite good, what is her name again?","Brilliant idea, horribly realized. Madonna's most fluid, intense, and believable acting ever."
4,"Great single and multiplayer game! If you're looking for a great FPS with hostages, this this game is for you!","My friend and I started playing this game about a week ago and let me tell you, the co-op missions are insane and challenging. I also played SWAT 3 and planing on buying the expansion due to the greatness of this game. To sum the game up for buyers, ""Intense, Ratifying, and addicting"" The game does take some time to get use to at first, but there are plenty of weapons to experiment with. Also, games provided by gamespy make it easy to play on LAN, other games that use their own servers are no well thought out, which is why I recommend this game!!"
1,You can't play online anymore.,"You can not play online this game any more.GameSpy CLOSED the MasterServer.http://www.gamespyarcade.com/support/Hey GameSpy Fans!We are sad to say that it's time to say good-bye to GameSpy Arcade and GameSpy Arena.

2,swat overview parts 1-4,"part ONErun don't waste your cash, --unless you enjoy cheesy grafics, lame musice bad sound effect, hard to control, non intesting, frustrating, --get the ideal---PART 2 is ----AWESOME!!!-- 3rd person overhead you control full team -Red alert stylePART 3-----EVEN BETTER-----1st person shotter--great online gami --er was years ago, dont know about now--winnable--at least over half of it without codes--very intense an very fun--great mods onlinePART 4------OVERKILL---harder to learn movments and commnds, more details, slightly better grafics --nearly impassable missions--very disappointing------------Jason age 31 love games ---still"
4,Don't waste the money.,"What I don't get is why this expansion seems to do, only, the same thing as the free 1.1 patch found online. In fact, if you download and install the 1.1 patch, you can't install this expansion. Odd thing, the patch from online is 40something MB, where as the expansion CD is almost 650MB. Beats me what all that extra information is for. Maybe the ads? Who knows.Anyhow, get the regular game, don't bother with this."
1,Guess I'll buy a different game,"Pros:The new maps and features are very good. If you liked Swat 4, you will like the expansion pack. Almost all of the new maps are pretty big, which is nice.Cons:The spyware is not a good feature. See K-Bass's review if you don't know what I am talking about. If the game were slightly less fun, the spyware would be enough to convince me not to buy it at all.There are quite a few new maps, which is good. My only gripe is that there should have been more maps in the original game. I hate it when you buy a video game like Swat 4 which has only a small number of maps, and you have to buy an expansion pack to make it seem like a full game."
4,It Could Have Happened to Me,"As a Jew who converted to Christianity a few years before this guy did, this could have been me. It's a great book. I guess the four stars is because it is simply factual, without the great wit and poetry, let's say, of Robert Service, or humor of Joel Salatin.This is an account of what happened to a young Jewish man who dared to become a Christian. His parents had him kidnapped by Orthodox Jews, who tried to deprogram him. He says that Orthodox Jews don't usually do this. He's not the only one to go through something like this. (No, I did not). Find a copy in a church or Christian school library if you cannot buy it. It is easy to read, and hits people like me quite close to home."
5,"Graham Scholes, my kind of teacher","This book is, by far, one of the best teaching texts I've seen for a beginner in watercolor painting. Graham Scholes fairly oozes enthusiasm for the medium and encouragement to his student. He clearly explains and shares dozens of practical clues and hints and leads one by the hand as he instills confidence to make those first attempts with this difficult medium."
5,Capy,I have used this light now for about 2 years. I'm a Captain on a truck company and the light has never failed me. It is super bright and hangs on my turnout coat facing forward. Well worth the price for the quality.
3,Compare this book to Bridget and you miss the point,"While, I don't think Ms. Forrester has written the great British novel here, I think it is an intelligent and, at times, witty book. Yes, it can be irritating with it's cutesy fonts and initials, but she makes some good observations here. One can see her writing style emerging and there is a definite voice. I think we should keep a watch out for future books from this author. Once she masters some character development, she could be a force to reckon with. I found the novel fun even if the ending was a little unsatisfying. I say give it a chance."
3,Dissapointing ending,"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was great. It was cute & funny, & I felt like I could relate to the main character. But as the book went on, the story got boring & senseless. All in all not a bad read, but the last 50 pages or so might put you to sleep."
2,I wish I had more to say....,"except that after reading this novel go on and on about nothing, words are hard to come by. I thought the premise of this book was very promising. However, at about the third chapter, I was tired of it. Having spent money on it, and being caught without a back-up read at the gym, I plowed through. This book was so completely uninteresting that I almost stopped reading it entirely with only fifty pages left. I forced myself to finish it, however, as I had come that far. There was a surprise at the end to somewhat reward me for my perseverance. However, it was a small victory, seeing that I cannot get the hours I wasted on this book back."
1,DANGEROUS TREAT - CHOKING HAZARD!,"These treats can create a very serious problem. I just opened the new bag I bought from Amazon and gave one to each of my three dogs and TWO OF THEM GOT THEM STUCK IN THEIR THROATS. Both were choking and both had to have them pried out of their mouths by my husband and I. Very scary. I have thrown them out. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUY THESE. Based on their shape, size and the fact that when they get wet they get sticky, they can choke your dog. DON'T BUY THESE. PERIOD."
4,cadet chicken chips,If I recall I returned this item because they didn't send me the pound as it stated. I got 3 oz bags so I returned them. If this is a different item order then I apologize.
4,"Five years later, still absolutely haunting...","The first time I heard battleflag was on the 'be still my heart' episode of ER. I remember watching the credits at the end but didn't catch the name of the band who did the song. It's been kind've an 'on again, off again' search. Every once in a while I'd hear it on TV or on the radio but couldn't catch the name of the band or the song. Two months ago, I started listening to shoutcast radio. Last week, I heard it for the first time in it's entirety and found out who did it!Funny, here we are FIVE years later and people are STILL talking about that episode and how this song was absolutely perfectly cast for the part. It's haunting melody tied in with the disturbingly frantic image of 'Lucy' mouthing ""Help me..."" to a stunned, shocked and helpless 'Dr. Carter'. That has to be one of the all-time suspensful season ending cliff hangers!"
4,Nice vaporizer,"This is a very nice vaporizer. You do have to use the pinch of salt as indicated by the manufacturer, but that's about it. It runs like a dream and is great for a baby's room. I clean mine nightly before using it because I just don't want to have to worry about bacteria build-up. It's very quiet, does the job, and I've used it myself for colds. A very nice investment for a good product."
1,Steam doesn't last!,"I found this product seemed cheap. It runs out of steam only a few hours into the night. No matter how much or little water you put in the tank, it putters out before the night is over! It is large and takes up a lot of space, although the water tank is large, it doesn't seem to matter. By 2 am everynight it is making a gurgling hissing noise and eventually just stops. I am not happy with this product at all and plan to take it back."
2,Not what the doctor ordered,"We were encouraged by our doctor to get a humidifier for our son because of his congestion and cough. We purchased this one because of value and tank size. It does not run for more than 5-6 hours before making disturbing girgling noises. Also, I usually turned it on when we put my son to bed and after 1-2 hours we would go in his room and everything would be damp including the furniture. It takes up so much room and makes very little steam. I would not recommend this item but tell you to put some more money with it and take it back for a more pricey model."
2,Not Satisified,"Very dissapointed. Impossible to get all the water out for proper cleaning. Using the vicks liquid is a mess, and after running for awhile, the vapor goes from smelling like vicks to smelling like smoke. Never really gets going, even after adding the reccommended salt. Big and bulky taking up too much room. If possible, find another alternative, like I am doing now."
2,vicks vaporizer,"While it has a large holding capacity, this vaporizer does not have an on or off switch and you have to pull the plug to turn it off... also, it stopped working after only 5 weeks... of course, just beyond the point of being able to return it."
1,Don't ignore bad reviews!,"I registered for this product even after reading the bad reviews, because I figured that if some people liked it, then it coudln't be all bad. I made a huge mistake.Everything that the bad reviews say it true. This vaporizer is a piece of junk. It is loud and clunky. It gets dangerously hot. The water burns off very quickly, then it just makes a horrible noise.Not to mention that it has no way to adjust the amount of steam it produces. The first time I turned it on, steam immediatly came pouring out. Within two minutes, everything in my daughters room was soaking wet, including her baby moniter and lamp, causing a fire hazard!If you are going to buy a vaporizer/humidifier, cough up the extra $15-$20 and get a good one. This one has been used once in my house and is already headed for the trash!"
1,Effective but noisy,"We bought this vaporizer to help with a certain person'ssnoring, but the unit itself generates way more gurglingnoises than the noxious snorer. This unit would undoubtedlyperform well in environments where its gurgling and burblingwould be drowned out by background noise, but it's notworked out for us in an otherwise quiet bedroom."
1,Don't understand the positive reviews,"I'm giving up on this product -- that's why I'm on Amazon at the crack of dawn!I'll repeat what a lot of the negative reviews said:--after two hours, enough water has burned off that it start making disturbing and loud sputtering and gurgling sounds--needs to have water added to it around three times a night--the vapor oil receptacle burns off about half of the oil but leaves the rest, resulting in a greasy mess--the steam vent is disturbingly hot and is absolutely NOT safe for toddlers that have the remotest chance of touching it--finally, the product feels cheap and shoddy -- I wish I had invested the $20 in a better product to begin withI feel cheated. The Vicks company needs to take a long hard look at this product. Seriously, if they think this is good enough to put out on the market, I don't want to try any more of their products.Other than that, I'm in love with it!----Steve, dad of an eight-month-old in Virginia"
2,Buy a humidifier instead.,"I bought this the first time my son had a cold. It doesn't work. The vaporizor is buy Vicks but uses Kaz inhalent, go figure. Even after buying the Kaz inhalent the thing barely puts of any steam and forget about smelling the inhalent."
4,This book was all i needed to start programing perl,"Unlike Laura Lemay, I'm not one for words. With in 14 days with no previous experience this book had me writing perl scripts. Covers all the basics, easy to follow, ideal for beginners , unlikely to teach experienced programmers anything new. I would recommend this book to anyone new to perl. Does not cover object oriented perl although it states for v5.005."
3,"Verbose, ok beginners book","I have an extensive programming background. I joined a new group that used PERL and a co-worker had this book so I borrowed it. It was somewhat frustrating because of its long windedness. The book could have conveyed the same ideas in 1/2 - 2/3's the space in some cases, especially the begiiner stuff like control flow. Also, it glosses over some of the advanced topics.Even so, it did the job and I learned PERL.If you are a beginner this book should be ok.I don't think the O'Reilly PERL books are good for learning PERL, only as references. The PERL Cookbook is pretty good, with some useful examples."
3,Simply bad math!,This is a nice book for starters (those who have no experience in programming at all). I'm giving it only 3 stars because there are a few minor math errors. For example on page 50 a formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is $cel * 5 /9 +32. It should be $cel * 9/5 +32. If you are serious about learning Perl get some of O'Reilly's books.
4,An excellent book for newbies.,"This book is organized in an extremely useful way. Each chapter contains excercises, explanations and quizes to tackle discreet skills in PERL, with deeper material added at the end of each chapter for those who have already had some programming experience. As a beginner, I found the book very instructive. I felt completely confortable with the pace and scope of the book.On occasion the book assumes a working knowledge of C or C++ in some of its descriptions or comparisons. This is great for those who know C, but I found it frustrating. Other than that caveat, this is the first teach-yourself-how book that I was truly geared for how I learn."
5,Quality,"Great book. Now, when is the video/dvd of the accompanying documentary going to be released ? By Molly Dineen, made in 1985 and shown on the BBC at the time.It's listed as no. 45 in the 50 best documentaries of all time ( a UK survey - check Wikipedia for the entry )But nowhere is it possible to find a copy to watch....come on Amazon, your fat tail profits from hard-to-find videos should mean that its worth getting hold of this one. And fifty quid from the RAI is just too much [...]Let's see..."
5,Nutri-Vet Probiotic,"We could no longer get Nutri-Vet Probiotic at Petsmart, so are glad to find it at Amazon. It is easy to mix the powder with our dog's food."
4,1962 classic more pertinent than ever,"Opponents of the 'No Child Left Behind' act's test-driven obsession with 'school accountability' should avail themselves of this slightly dated classic. Hoffmann dismantles the claims by testing companies that their instruments measure anything more than cultural concordance between testing company and student. He also takes on the notion that test questions are clearly written in the first place, showing many examples to the contrary.He seems more interested in reforming the tests, and does not attack the notion of testing itself other than in passing. This little book should be read alongside Diane Ravitch's ""The Language Police"" and Gould's ""Mismeasure of Man"" to complete the picture and bring one's understanding of the problems with testing up-to-date."
3,Reviewers are the book's editors,"A meta-review -- 3 positive reviews by the work's editors and one negative review by a reader? Editors: don't ""review"" your own book, please."
4,Fourth printing!,I am a contributor to this book and am gratified to know that it's still being read. My two stories sprung from moments when taking care of very ill patients that made the real and the surreal seem to change places for a moment. The realities of life can perhaps be better understood by examining moments of apparent incongruity.One of the reasons I became a nurse was to get in closer contact with the nitty-gritty of human life. I got at least as much as I bargained for.
3,OK,OK. Poetry is not my thing; but purchased this book because it was meant for nurses. It was very interesting.
2,Small and overpriced,"I was disappointed by these mugs. Yes, it is listed as a 10-ounce mug, but they are very petite given the price being charged for them. It really isn't much bigger than a tea cup. I'd rate these higher at half the cost or less."
4,great product for the price,"I am a teacher and have 240 students. I keep track of work completed by giving a stamp; I'd say that I give 2-3 stamps per week, so we're talking about 600 stamps PER WEEK. This stamp lasted all though the first 9 week grading period- that's 5400 uses!"
5,Fond Memories,This video brought me back home (Jamaica). I don't believe I will ever get tired of watching it. There were moments when I laughed and moments when I cried but all good. Tears were of joy to see that Richie Stephens have not forgotten his roots and that he is putting his God given talent to help where he thinks the Lord is guiding him.
5,relaxing,"The CD is very relaxing and the lyrics have very deep meaning. Listening to this cd is a great way to decompress after a hard day. It helps you examine your life and you realize you have a lot to be very thankful for.By the way, Lainson is from Nebraska."
4,Great music bad not a successful documentary,"It's great to hear Ry Cooder with such fresh and real musicians as on this music documentary. The performances are mostly improvised, and there are moments of magic here. However, as a documentary I don't like the chopped up story and sometimes random order of scenes. The lack of a real, interesting story is evident. OK, we follow the Buena Vista Social Club on their way to stardom, but we do not really get as close to them as we would like. The documentary would have needed a better script. But I'm grateful that this valuable music project has been documented, and seing and hearing Ry Cooder and his talented son (on drums) is great! [...]"
5,How could you think anything else?,"I was told to watch this DVD by my daughters who were captivated by this documentary of muscial talents. I was not sure I would, could, relate to their ""tastes"" in musical and artist splender, until I watched the DVD of ""The Buena Vista Social Club"". Such an amazing story, such brillant musical tallent; it's impossible to describe! You have to see it to ""experience"" the ""Buena Vista Social Club""."
5,A touching look into gorgeous music,"Buena Vista (the modern day adaptation) occured by happenstance (as the film shows)...and thank god. Even in Cuba, this genre of music was all but forgotten. It is pure, ornate, romantic, heartful, ernest, and downright beautiful. We also get to meet the wonderful people behind the music and see them live out their dreams and aspirations. This journey is as heart-wrenching as it is uplifting...a must see."
5,Buena Vista Social Club,"Wim Wenders showing another simple and successfull aproach of a real situation. Good perfomances of fantastic musicians, not forgetting Ry Cooder's guitar. When it was on exhibition in Lisbon, I flew there to watch it and I'm still amazed by the camera work when Omara and Ibrahim singing Silencio in the studio."
5,A Spanish teacher's dream!!,"This film is incredible. Its treatment of the Cuban musicians, as well as the delicate handling of the culture as a whole, is fantastic. I showed several Spanish classes the film, some very basic students and some more advanced--all enjoyed it very much, thanks to the humor, vibrance, and beauty of the video. Especially exciting for the students were the scenes in which the band members visit New York.A wonderful look into the life of some amazing men and women utterly committed to creating clear, beautiful music. Fascinante!"
4,Exciting musical documentary,"This documentary presents the rediscovery and reunion of a number of masterful Cuban musicians, all of whom are aged and many of whom have not performed for many years. It is inspiring to watch how seemingly effortlessly they return to the stage, as well as their respect and affection both for their craft and for each other. They tell their own stories during interesting interviews. Although the film is packed with wonderful music, it is unfortunate that director Win Wenders cuts away from so many songs before they have concluded. Nevertheless, this remains a vital document that led me to contemplate the many incredible talents that must exist in obscurity all over the world."
1,Music video or amateur travelogue?,"OK .....caveat emptor .....but I did place some reliance on the number of stars in your rating for this CD. Your rating was 5 stars, I gave it one because there was no provision for a zero."
2,Boring,"I'm sorry but I found the movie dull. The music was kind of dull and repetitive, most of the musicians, although clearly extremely talented, were past their prime (Would you go see an athlete who was in his 80s) and Ry Cooder comes off as alternately condescending and hero-worshiping."
5,I would give it 10 stars if i could.,"I saw this film in cinema and it was very good but seeing it on DVD again, it was much better. The colour and texture are nearly edible. the music is a1. i have since bought all the cd in the Buena Vista Social Club coll.(6 in all). It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentroy in 2000 and also won a whole host of grammy's. I want to go to Cuba now and so will you..."
4,Good documentary,"It was a rather good gift for someone that really loves the Club, so mission accomplished. The music CD has nothing to do with the film though."
5,Fantastic look into Cuban music culture,"This is a must-see for any world-music lover. I found the beginning a little confusing, as the perspective shifted back and forth from a concert in Amsterdam to the streets of Havana, but once I realized what was happening, I was hooked. Absolutely recommend."
5,"A good intro, but don't stop there.","This video is wonderful if all you know about Cuban music is Buena Vista Social Club. However, if you can find the video called ""Lagrimas Negras,"" which was made before BVSC and is often shown on WorldLinkTv, you'll quickly see that BVSC is a direct rip-off of an earlier video about a different group of son musicians. By all means, enjoy this video, but use it to explore deeper into traditional Cuban music."
4,Great but................,"I think this is a well done documentary, with excellent music of course and full of nostalgia. This was going to be a gift for one of my parents. I thought it was subtiteled, but it was not, so he could not enjoy this great video, sadly I was vey disaponted."
4,A real gem,Ry Cooder and Reuben Gonzalez are the stars of this enlightening documentary. It is a story about a Cuban who gathers long-forgotten stars from the Buena Vista Social Club together to reunite.
4,great for the classroom!,I show this movie in my High School Spanish class! Kids love it and have often downloaded the music onto their ipods!
4,si,Great dvd if you're intrested in learning the stories of the musicians behind the record.highly recomend it for all die hard music lovers.
2,Buena Vista social club,It was never delivered to me! The place I ordered it from finally emailed me that they did not have it. I know the CD annd it is an excellent one!
2,"Great movie, bad version","Look out! Although the information given here says this is in widescreen format, the DVD I got is actually in TV-chopped ""fullscreen"" format (a euphemism if there ever was one)."
3,"AMAZING movie, ANNOYING release","Yes this movie is as wonderful as everyone says, but as a WARNING, the subtitles are imprinted in the film, which is somewhat annoying. I.e. you can't remove the subs, and they are distracting."
5,"Seen the Video, go to CUBA",I first saw this film at the cinema in the UK. As soon as the DVD was released I bought it. The sound and atmosphere this film creates made me want to go to Cuba. So we went to Havana this April and it's as good as the film suggests. The Cuban tourist board should use it as a promo. If you've bought the CD buy the DVD.
5,Gotta love needlepointing,would recommend this book for any needlepoint lover. The color to the projects in this book is beautiful.A favorite are the flower needlepoints.
5,Fabulous needlepoint book!,The Ehrman Needlepoint Book is an excellent addition to my library of needlepoint projects to complete. It is very inspirational and includes ideas on displaying needlepoint projects as well. There are projects that will appeal to many different styles of decor. The book introduced me to the website as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone who admires needlepoint.
3,Only good to look at,"Their conversion chart at the end of the book is USELESS as it is between Anchor and DMC, none of these are used in the projects included in this book.The colors in the charts are hard to read as many colors come close in shades.So it is good to look at but you have to do a lot of conversion work to be able to use different wool brand, like me trying to convert their wool to DMC, I'm going crazy at the moment trying do that. You won't know until you actually decide to do a project from this no good book."
5,VERY GOOD BOOK,"VERY GOOD BOOK, JUST DIDNT LIKE THE ACTUAL WORDING OF THE BOOK ITSELF WAS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR ITS TYPE OF PLOT, ANY WAYS VERY GOOD BOOK ABOUT THE TIMES."
3,"The Chicago Beer Wars, Revisited","I have one problem with this book, and I'm willing to concede it may not even be a valid one. The author did an admirable job researching her subject, and anything one could possibly want to know about Dean O'Banion is contained in these pages. However, since O'Banion was assassinated at such an early stage in the battle for control of Chicago's beer trade (1924) and the war didn't effectively end until the remnants of the North Side Gang were decimated in one swoop during the bloody St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929, I felt that much of this book's contents were a rehash of the rivalry between the Capone forces and O'Banion's successors. Again, not to take anything away from Ms. Keefe's great writing or the biographical information itself. It is simply my opinion."
5,"Can you appreciate ""Neva Get Enuf""?","Wow, ""Neva Get Enuf"" is definitely my favorite mainstream R&B song to come out in 2002. It's a gorgeous mellow track which samples Teddy Pendergrass' 70's R&B classic ""Close the Door."" The melody is catchy, sweet and warm - just the way I like it."
1,THIS IS THE SHHH'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I HEARD ABOUT 3LW AND I THOUGHT THEIRE ARE HOT BUT THEY DIDNT WHEN THE CD CAME OUT IN 02 I WAS LIKE IS HOT I WAS LISTING TO IT I WAS DISSAPOINTED ONLY GOOD SONG WAS I DO I HOPE THEIRE NEW ALBUM IS ABOUT TO BE HOT THEY SHOULD MAKE MORE SONGS WITH HOT RAPPER MORE CLUBBANGERS THATS WHY I DIDNT BOUGHT IT! DONT BUY IT IS A ""WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! BYE BYE"
1,--------,"3lw was never a very popular group. i think thw only time they ever made heads turn was when their single ""i do"" blow up and when the group actually broke up. i dont see any point in them trying to get back together. it isnt like they're going to be the next destiny's child. omg, they could even make a dent compared to destiny's child. this album is dull, real dull. who the hell gave them a deal?"
3,3LW too slow,The album has too many slow songs it should be more up best and fun. I Need That is awsome and so in I Do. And there's a couple others that are cool.
3,Not bad!,"Their debut might be a little better, but these girls are definitely growing. ""I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)"" is definitely the best track....I think I've heard it on the radio at least once. It's really catchy, and Loon's rap sequence is awesome....instead of sleazily blabbing about how he wants to take a girl to bed, he says, 'I'm due for some kisses, I'm due for some huggin', I'm due for some lovin'/I need a wife in my life, you're lookin' like you're due for a husband.' I find that kind of class and talk of commitment really sexy, and I gotta give props to Loon for showing a lot of other rappers that he's so above them. Anyways, this is a pretty good CD. Not *quite* as good as their debut, but not bad. If they work a little harder on hooks, they can really get big on mainstream radio."
3,itz ok neutriz gon oh well,itz n ok album but 2 b honest without neutri it'z not much. The songs are really good but with only 2 vocals u can tell that neutris strong mature voice is missing. The guest appreances are really heavy but it just doesnt make up for the lost member. Neutri left for many reasons i think the record label shud have given her a chance!oh well buy the album if u really want to!
4,"good cd, but i like the other one better","this cd sounds more mature then the first.i do- good dancable song. 7/10never get enuf- i love this one. 10/10i need that (i want that) imo best song on the cd. you can dance to it. 10/10ain't no maybe- nothing bad or special about this song. 7/10ghetto love and heartbreak- another great song, upbeat. 10/10good good girl- i don't really care for it. its about losing your virginity. you CAN relate though. mostly adrienne sings this one. a lot of ppl i know like it so i give it 8/10.put em up- dancable song. i like it 8/10.this goes out- great song, its a slower track but i really like it. 10/10leave wit you (think i wanna)- great song 9/10crazy- its about being in affair, good lyrics 8/10imo the rest of the songs r 7/10. just average"
3,destiny's child wannabe's in the house,"man this is okay but not my thaing this is a cheap knock off of destiny's child from their debut and plus like Dc these girls already have drama cause natori just left over racial issues anyway this is not a bad cd heard better and worser 13yerars girls in the 8th grade are just loving this features lil kim, loon and the artist formerly known as puff daddy."
4,Hasn't worked yet but still have faith.,Been using this product for 2 months so far.Haven't conceived yet but we still have faith that it will work soon.
4,It Does What It Claims,"My husband was diagnosed with low sperm count and low motility due to being anemic. He was put on iron supplements and we were able to conceive after 4 months, but unfortunately we suffered a miscarriage during the early part of the pregnancy. I searched the inter-net to find a product that would increase his sperm count as well as allow for the production of healthy viable sperm. A month later we went for another sperm analysis and the Doctor told us his sperm count had increased dramatically and we should have no trouble with trying to conceive again. I'm sure his anemia was helped out by the iron supplements but I strongly believe that the fertility blend played a big impact in getting his sperm count up there. We are still trying to conceive as I type this (he has been taking the supplements for the past 2 months)and I feel more confident that we will get pregnant this month with the help of fertility blend and the OV watch."
5,It improved my husband's low morphology!!,"My husband started taking Fertility Blend for Men in July after his initial dx was poor morphology (3% normal). The doctors told us that we would most likely not conceive without IVF. At his follow-up in November, his morphology improved to 6% which took him out of the subfertile range. The doctors are pleased with the results and have confidence that we can now conceive without IVF. I believe the vitamins improved his numbers. I think his numbers will continue to improve the longer he takes the supplements. I would definitely recommend this product.One thing to mention, for any of you who are not good at reading directions like my husband. The serving size is 2 capsules. My husband was only taking 1 a day the first couple weeks - oops!"
2,Didn't really work...,"I've been taking them daily, dual dose (4 pills, instead of 2), for the past 2 months...Truth is, I don't know if they're working or not.They do seem to make the genitals more sensitive, almost like they have a bit of viagra mixed in them; though the effect only becomes somewhat noticeable after taking the pills for 2 weeks or something (unlike viagra which usually works within a few minutes to an hour).Wife is still not pregnant; though there could be a million and one reasons as to why.Often you only read about the positive comments, and nothing about the environment. If the only thing these pills do, is make a man more sensitive, and make him want more sex, it's only natural that the chances increase for conception.So, no results for me yet!"
1,Hurt stomach,"tried this product for 2 days only, donno if it work or not but what i know is that it really hurts my stomach. donno why as it all should be natural, but that's what happened."
1,I just got my package!!!,hopefully every thing work out for us wish us luck and good day everyone. i have no idea wat t
1,Nothing yet.,"My husband has been taking this fertility blend pill four times a day as instructed to do, they were making him so tired and feel weak, so he only took it once a day two pills. He is still complaining that he feels tired and achey in his back and legs. So i don't know if its from this or just what he does for a living cutting trees. ? But just wanted to see if anyone else is having this problem with these pills? I don't want to keep having him take them if they aren't good for him.?Fertility Blend for Men"
3,Good vitamin mix,"My husband has taken this blend on & off for years - so I don't think it's doing much to help fertility because nothing's happened yet!But it's a good multi-vitamin base to start from, to make sure he's getting everything essential that his body needs.Arrives quickly & in a perfect state."
5,Worked for Us!,"My husband was diagnosed with a varicocele that was blocking sperm production once we had already purchased this product. While waiting for it to arrive, we used zinc vitamins and folic acid vitamins (2 a day) as we had been told they could increase sperm count. We had been trying to get pregnant for over 11 months, and my husband had had two semen analyses that came back low (14million/mil), but with good morphology and motility. He took the vitamin for two weeks and three weeks later i found out I was pregnant! This was the only change he made in his diet, exercise etc. He still has a varicocele that needs repairing and he hasn't had a semen analysis since, so I can't tell whether this product had an effect or not, but 5 weeks after taking this product, I had a positive pregnancy test."
5,"Wow, this works!","My wife and I have been trying to have a baby for a while. My counts were on the low side of normal after cancer and treatment. Within one month of taking these vitamins, she's pregnant. Now I don't know whether this has anythng to do with it but since they're just vitamins, it doesn't harm to try and honestly I am more than impressed with the results if true."
1,boring gay sex,"I have found Math courses more interesting than this movie. Perhaps for a total novice there could be a few pointers worth watching, but I found this more a sleep aid than helpful."
1,this moive is not good,"This movie is really boring. It is about the joy of sex; however, it is not good. I regreat buying this movie."
3,boys meet boys,"good looking boy there are but ,the story were a short doing sex are not very long.Need more re-expose often mainly below .... When there make love must in front the camera,the boys must touch each another,and when in room or in pravite place have to make sound just like having sex with girl.For example : uuhhhaaa that great ,a little bit like."
5,Great Buy,Very satisfied with my PC build using this PSU. It is extremely quiet and doing a great job in the 1 month that has passed since my install.I have heard good things about Ultra products (especially the power supplies which are used here at work) and I can say I am very impressed thus far.Good standard connection options and the flex cabling helps keeps critical components in the clear on the motherboard.Thanks amazon and Ultra for a great buying experience!
1,Very Disappointing,"Far too much of EVERY chapter devoted to repeating essentially ""I know what you're going through"", ""You feel this, you've tried that"" on and on and on. A single well-written glossy magazine article would cover more useful information than you get in this whole book. Find good medical and health sites online instead and save your money."
1,this book is a terrible idea .... might as well give up and enjoy your pudgy self,"I am a doctoral level medical professional, and I have to warn women - if you are serious about losing the extra weight at midlife, do not do what this book says. It's okay if you need some help with your self-acceptance at this moment, and it's good for understanding what has happened at midlife, and how your body changes. However, if you want something to motivate you and teach you a successful strategy to decrease the weight and keep it off, this is NOT the book ! Very disappointing on that measure. You don't learn to outsmart or win this way."
2,"Disappointing, but enjoyed the humor.","I had high hopes that this book would help me reverse the steady increase in my weight that has been occurring over the past several years in spite of my healthy diet and exercise program. Unfortunately the author didn't provide me with any new information. The message I got was accept the fact that you're going to put on weight with menopause.What did help me lose weight, as well as improve my sleep and alertness, was Barry Sears' Zone diet. Waterhouse laments that menopausal women can put on weight eating rice cakes. Sears explains why this happens. (Bottom line: don't eat rice cakes!) Waterhouse tells us that some women actually like their more rounded, apple-shaped figures. Sears explains why it is a look we should avoid.I enjoyed the humor, but if you're serious about losing weight, trying reading some of Barry Sears' books. I've been losing half a pound a week consistently, feel more mentally alert, and sleep better."
3,No new news,"A decent book, with some interesting information about fat cells, but in general, nothing new. She, like most other experts these days reccommends five small meals, water, and lots of exercise. A friend had raved about it, but I wasn't all that impressed."
2,Readers digest version--save your money,"Here is a synopsis of the book so you may spend your money elsewhere:1) Don't diet2) Get used to your ""new"" menopausal figure--ie. learn to love it.3) Exercise 4 times a week for at least an hour so you feel better--but don't expect miracles in the weight-loss department.Well. duh! I really felt the book rambled on about the obvious and in the end, I just ended up feeling depressed. What the book did manage to do was to thoroughly explain the biological process of why your body is changing. That, I already knew!"
4,Informative,"I found this book to be very informative. It helped me understand what happens to the female body as we age from preteen to elderly and how to deal with it. I recommend reading this book! However, I think the whole book would be better as a magazine article because chapter after chapter was repeative. Read the book, but save your money and check it out at the library."
2,A lot of repetition,"There was some interesting information in the book, but there was also a LOT of repetition used to drive home a point. While it did explain menopause weight gain, it didn't offer me any new solutions to loosing weight like the title suggests. It could have been condensed into a brochure!!"
2,affair at royalties,dated and British but a lively mystery filled with interesting quirky characters. lots of action and interaction. surprise ending. satisfying.
2,IMPORTANT INFO,"I would normally give this film 4/5 but this is a very poor DVD presentation.First of all, there are no special features. There's not even a menu screen or scene selection. I'm not kidding, the film just automatically plays.Second of all, Chun Li's shower scene is shortened. So this DVD is NOT uncut.But that aside, it is a top quality anime and almost as good as Fatal Fury. Buy this if you can find it at a low price.The DVD is in Dolby Stereo and is letterboxed at 1.85:1."
2,WHY!? THEY RUINED SUCH A GREAT MOVIE!,"This is such a disgrace to the SF name. I cant believe they didnt put in the original japanese dialog with english subtitles in it. By far the most disappointing translation yet. And god....the soundtrack. ugh....KMFDM, Alice in Chains? It just doesn't work for it in this movie. If only a true translation would come out. If you were a fan of the original, stay clear by all means. If its new to you, you won't be missing much."
4,A good job for an old classic,"Here in Mexico the movie were released on VHS and DVD on Spanish and no english or japanese soundtracks available at the timeI have imported this DVD and the japanese soundtrack gives a better taste of the movie (less ""childish"")The picture quality is terrible, specially watching on a 42"" TV; however, is OK for me taking into account that is a very old movie"
2,"Decent, but WORTHLESS in comparison to the original","Having seen a fansubtitled version with the original music and dialogue, I have to say this new version is really crappy in comparison to the one I saw so long ago...The music, though Japanese, just fit the action much better than that ""Alice in Chains"" stuff. And they didn't bog down the dialogue with stuff like ""one, two, THREE strikes YOU'RE OUT!!""I have but one request: release a DVD version that has the original dialogue and music tracks. If I could even snag a copy from overseas that had subtitles I'd be happy."
5,Street Fighter,I have been looking for the original Japanese version for years. Now I have both on the same disk. Its great!!!
3,The Best Video Game Movie Ever Made,"Street Fighter II The Movie is hands down the best movie made that was based on a video game. Without compromising anything that was great about the fighting game they managed to create a feature length film that connects all of the games many characters. Its great to finally own this film without any of the censorship that occured in the previous releases. My only complaint is that its not anamorphic widescreen, really in this day and age is it really that hard to add this simple feature for widescreen TV's? Must I watch this film on my beautiful LCD HDTV as a small square in the middle of a big 40"" screen? Lazy work on the part of Manga. Great film, decent DVD release that is ruined because it lacks one simple feature."
5,New to anime- this is the greatest anime film to start with,"I really don't watch much anime at all, but when I stumbled across this movie I was seriously impressed. It's pure genius this film to sum it up.A very humble plot to this movie but somehow it completely works well. Ryu and ken will have you glued to the screen with their stories and fight sequences. Like the other reviews said there are loads of fights in this movies but all are great, all of them.Bottom line, whether you're a street fighter fan, a person looking to see anime or someone who just wants to watch an entertaining film, get Street Fighter II : Animated Movie and maybe like me this one will go in your personal hall of fame as a great movie."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"Sunday, August 01, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Ultimately disappointing.An ultimately disappointing anime based on the famous Capcom franchise. Due to the volume of characters that would populate the SF2 world, the inability to give each their due is a failing. Zangief and Blanka and numerous others are given short shrift in favor of the Shotoklones. There are story arcs that die in dead ends, almost as if this was only part of a larger story. I'm told the Alpha movie is better and will investigate that. While it was neat to see the combatants rendered to screen as anime, it just didn't measure up, joining other conversion disappointments like Toshinden, Tekken, and Night Warriors. Oh well, at least we have Mame32 to play them all."
3,decent enough,"A pretty good movie once you get past the bad voice acting, If they had added a japanese track & subtitles this would be much better. If you can get the japanese version (even on VHS) get that instead."
3,A flawed yet enjoyable piece of anime,"Did the loss of some key scenes make a difference? Not really. Did the plot need more work? Yes definitely.However, if you watch it for what it is (an attempt to bring a video game to life on the screen) it ain't that bad. Some great fight scenes, and some pretty good animation work which still stands up today.Let's face it, if you're a street fighter fan (and I am one), you'll love the first moment one of the characters uses a signature move from the game.You could do a lot worse."
3,Original soundtrack is much better,"I actually think the dubbed version with the heavy metal soundtrack is ""okay"", but the original Japanese soundtrack was much, MUCH better. My friend had a fan-subbed copy of the original and I enjoyed it a lot more. The opening fight with Ryu vs. Sagat actually might be better in the American version but pretty much every other fight (including the climactic battle at the end) was better in the original Japanese. And music definitely has a huge impact on how much you enjoy a fight scene!NOTE: If this is IS a version with both audio tracks (the one I rented did not), I'd give it another star.As for the movie itself, just about everyone shows up, but some characters (particularly Thunderhawk) don't really match their personas from the game. The ending is also kinda silly..."
4,mangafreak,worked fine no worries. but its not totally uncut its missing a swear word from guile but everything els was sweet
3,"Great Anime, Too Bad it has been CENSORED!","What's the point of advertising a film as ""Unrated - For Mature Audiences Only"" if they go ahead and cut it anyhow? I recall they have released two versions of this film on video to date, one for kids and this ""mature"" version. Both have been slashed by the censors!What most anime fans who watch this version of the film do not know is that it has been cut in one key place, namely the Chun Li shower scene. I was lucky enough to see a subtitled bootleg of this film when it was first released in Japan many years ago, and it was quite revealing to say the least.Does the cut impact the film greatly? Not really. But I couldn't help but feel cheated when I see the original vision of the animators deliberately tampered with. Buy it if you want the best of the Street Fighter animes, but stay away if you want to hold out for a restored version."
3,Subtitles,"Just got the dvd in the mail today. This is the ALMOST proper version of the movie as opposed to that horrible english dub that was put out years ago. The only major problem I had with this version was the new translation of the subtitles, which pissed me off. I watched the original version when it first came out and there was definitely a difference this time around. It seems to me that Manga tried to change around the translation a bit to make it more americanized. Also adding the lyrics into the songs onto the screen, which annoyed the hell out of me cause it was distracting when watching the best two fights of the movie. Nonetheless this is the closest its gonna get to the original japanese version. So if you really want the real deal its worth a buy. (ps: I really would give the movie 5 stars cause I love it, however the translation bothered me on this dvd so I gave it a 3 for the dvd.)"
4,Street Fighter 2,"I was sick one day and was flipping through the channels when I was lucky enough to find this movie. I missed the first 10 minutes but that made no difference. Whether you are a fan of anime or not it just doesn't matter. The story was well thought out, and the characters were intriguing. After watching this movie I felt as though I did not just waste an hour and a half of my time. I would recommend buying this movie to anyone. There is nothing wrong with a good story in the format of a cartoon, you just have to give it a chance and have an open mind about it."
5,RYU IS THE BEST!,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! im glad i bought this movie cuz it is the BEST fighting movie ive ever seen!I really like how my fav SF character, Ryu, fought in the movie! I like how he beated that one guy with one hit in the ring! When Ryu and Ken were fighitng, they were soooo awesome!"
5,This is a totally cool action movie!,"This is really a great little movie.I don't officially own a copy of it,but I hope to(someday).The animation is really good,has a few problems though.If you want a good movie to watch one weekend,I recommened this.For your money,it's worth it!"
4,A personal favorite,"This isn't the best anime ever, and there are some plot problems. But still, I loved this movie. The soundtrack was the best I've heard yet in Japanese animation. The fight scenes were awesome and much more realistic than in Fists of Fury. I don't expect everyone to love it, but it's definitely worth seeing."
2,I preferred the Japanese original..,"While I liked the animation and simplistic plot of the movie, the decision to change the soundtrack and to only include the English dubbed version on a DVD, nonetheless, hardly makes purchasing this DVD worthwile. I'm sure there are rock fans out there who will disagree with me on this, but if you've ever heard the original soundtrack, you'd see just how much more inspiring this film could've been. Also, the dubbing just doesn't quite cut it when Ken or Ryu shout out their attacks. Voice actors aren't as enthused in yelling out the special attacks as the Japanese voice actors did."
5,Best Anime Movie I've Seen,"One of the most entertaining action films I've ever seen, and definitely the best animated film I've seen. The fight scenes are intense and cool, the dialogue isn't too bad, and the music is great. Finally, they made Ryu the main hero/fighter (which he is in the game) and Guile a secondary character. The story flows perfectly without boring you during the non-fight-scenes. As for the unrelated fight scenes created just for the appearance of the fighters (Zangief, Dhalsim, Blanka) I thought this wasn't too bad cos fans of these characters would be disappointed to find their fav hero isn't in the ultimate anime movie, and there isn't enough room to fit every hero in the same plot. The only error in this film is, what the heck happened to Sagat and Balrog at the end?"
1,The Movie is Fantastic BUT There is no Extras.,"Where is the menu, and the japanise translation WHERE? The only thing inside the dvd is the movie and that's it. No nothing, I would've bought the VHS if I knew the dvd was going to be the same. It was a waste of time making this into a dvd with nothing on it."
2,SCRIPT SCREW UP,"THE ANIMATION IS TRULY AWESOME, HOWEVER THE SCRIPT IS NOT TRUE TO THE JAPANESE TRANSLATION. THE SCRIPT IS TOTALLY ORIENTATED FOR 12 AND UNDER. THEY SHOULD REDO THIS WITH THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT OR SUBTITLES. I SAW THE SUBTITLED VERSION WITH THE ORIGINAL SCORE AND THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING! AN EASY FIVE STARS. THE REMIX LOSES IT'S FLAVOR; WHICH GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT NO MATTER HOW TERIFFIC THE ANIMATION IS, IF THE SCRIPT SUCKS IT'S HARD TO WATCH. I GIVE THIS TWO STARS JUST TO BE GENEROUS."
4,Good New condition,This was pick up as a set I didn't even know that it existed.It is no longer made I guess it's ok for kidsReal cheap can't beat the price.
4,"Great animation, fair plot.","Strong points: Great animation, the music (not the songs)is very good, the opening scene is superb. Shortcomings: some characters didn't have their share of the action. Eg, Guile was completely escluded of all fighting scenes."
3,DO NOT buy this! Get a dubbed version if you can!,"I saw the dubbed version on VHS many years ago and loved it. When I found out it was being released on DVD I immediately bought it. What a mistake!Ok, here's what is BAD. 1) There is no menu, AT ALL. The movie plays, then ends. No commentary, no extras, NOTHING! 2) It's dubbed ONLY. The voices aren't that bad, but still I prefered the dubbed version WAY more. 3) The music was changed. In some scenes I can see, but most of the darn movie was remixed!!! WHY?! I thought the Japanase soundtrack was much better. During the first Sagat/Ryu fight scence, Chun-Li/Vega (ahem, Balrog), etc.I guess it's better than nothing, but I definitely am disappointed and honestly can't recommend it unless you really gotta have it."
3,I'd give it 4 stars if it weren't so Americanized.,"This has been called the best fighting game anime.. But, this was one of the first anime to suffer from Americanization, and that doesn't sit well with purists such as myself. While the dubbing may be cheesy here and there, I actually liked the voices for the characters. The animation is superb.My only two complaints are that Chun-Li's shower scene was cut from both the PG-13 AND the Mature version. Why both? My second complaint is that the music has been changed to suit the ""mainstream"" audience. I haven't heard the Japanese music, but it's probably better. What we got is actually not too bad, though. The story itself is incredibly basic, and it needs to drag sometimes just to make it seem less so. Overall, if you like Street Fighter, check it out, or if possible, grab the fansub."
5,Great anime!,"Street Fighter II - The Animated Movie is amazing. It's without-a-doubt the best anime I've seen. I'm a devoted Street Fighter fan and truely enjoyed seeing a story-line and characterizations fit to serve Street Fighter. The only drawback was the lack of DVD features. Wait, maybe I should rephrase that...There are no DVD features. The DVD has no menu and begins like a VHS would. The only feature it has is that it allows you to skip scenes. I have not seen the Japanese version but from what I hear, this edition is an edited version of that one. I still believe this is a good buy."
2,Visuals Not remastered,"I bought this thinking the visuals were remastered same as the audio to 5.1.Not so, this looks like a VHS transfer to DVD, even image jumps or has effects like the ones in planet terror. unfortunately the effects are not made on purpose.Don't buy this, wait for a blu ray version if one comes out anytime soon.Really dissapointed with [...]"
2,i want a buy this DVD,hello friends... you will contact with me? i wait your message for Street fighter II.
4,"Not as Good as the Japanese Version, But...","Much MUCH better the live-action movie ""street Fighter"" Of course it pales to the Japanese version. But the Englishize version is well done. I esp. love the voices of Chun Li, Ryu, and Master Bison and the soundtrack fits the situations very well with a mix of heavy metal & industral. A must have for Street Fighter nuts like myself.!!!"
3,"Cut, censored, leashed","3 stars for the dvd - 5 stars for the movie ... but ...I'm in the UK and bought the original, years ago upon release. I've seen the dub many, many times. This dub is NOT uncensored. In the original, there are two uses of the F word. One from DeeJay (Those are some bad ass mother ******* - and then at the end, Guile yells 'I'll rip your ******* heart out Bison!'These have been replaced with - 'Bad ass Mothers...'And 'I'll rip your lousy heart out Bison.'Two swear words don't make a movie (Though Guile's original line rocked) but the header of Uncut, uncensored, unleashed, is just a plain lie.And yeah, it could have done with a cleanup and some widescreen correction too."
3,"Great show, but no DVD features","The show is great, the best Street Fighter movies ever produced.When you pop this DVD onto your DVD player and espect it to have nice fancy animation intro and menu. Sorry to dissapoint you. It will only play like a normal VHS.This is an English dubbed of a Japanese anime. the english voice actors are done pretty badly, the voice doesn't sounds like the voice the character should be. I would suggest to get a japanese with English subtitle (if there are any). I watched the Japanese version, and they did a great job on voice, though I don't understand what are they talking about, I only read the subtitle.In this show, a good japanese dub with english sub is much better than a bad english dub."
4,"Good soundtrack, bad extras...","I first saw this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel (somehow Street Fighter counts as sci-fi) and the first thing I noticed about it was the artwork quality. It's fantastic. But what about the rest of it? A painfully simple storyline? A rather 'impolite' Ryu? And if you happen to resort to buying the ...DVD in the UK... Cheap and trashy subtitles? No original Japanese voice-overs? (An anime DVD is not an anime DVD without the original Japanese voice-overs!) Well, the main menu was pretty impressive, but they could have supplied the soundtrack separately. (I can't even buy THAT in the UK!)But, enough whining, the DVD is okay. I'm being generous with the rating and only because the artwork is impressive."
4,a good rent,"The voice acting stinks and the script is laughable. Some of the characters look like they're out of fifties cartoons. But who cares??? The fight scenes are...awesome dude!!! And that's what this entire movie is, non-stop seamingly pointless fight scenes..."
4,Incredible Read,I picked this book at random from my daughter's bookcase not realizing it was based on true facts. I was immediately engrossed in the style and story. It was my first encounter with this author and was completely satisfied with the in-depth review of the characters. The style provided much more interest to understanding the individual motives of the players. I look forward to reading other titles by Thomas Thompson.
4,Bilingual reader,"I read this book and was amazed by a story I had never heard of before because I'm a foreigner and this took place before my time as well. My boyfriend told me about it when he showed me the house where it took place, he also let me borrow his Mother's book. I was fascinated with it, moreover, was shocked to find correspondence between Mr. Robinson and the owner of the book due to land ownership issues. This is confirmation that life is more exciting than any movie, it certainly has plenty of material to offer. I would love to buy this book for my Mother but she only reads in Spanish, has it been translated?"
1,grossly unfair to Dr. Hill,"A good friend of mine worked closely with Dr. Hill and reports that this book is grossly unfair to Dr. Hill. Modern thought is that his wife Joan died from Toxic Shock Syndrome, an illness not known or described at the time of her death. The time course, refractory nature, symptoms and fulminant course all fit quite well. Having treated septic shock in the ICU, I can also say with authority that with the available treatments at the time it is unlikely she would have survived in any case. Dr. Hill took her to the hospital where he was known since he would reasonalby expect his wife to receive the best treatment since he was personally known there. And it is absurd to think he planned to kill his wife with an illness that was not known or understood at the time.making Dr. Hill the villian makes for a more commercial story, but I ask you to consider that if he did not murder his wife how cruel his death was, to be murdered in the view of his mother and son."
2,Blood and Money,Supposed to be a classic true crime story. Story maybe true but the book moves slowly.
3,Blood and Money,I purchased this book for a gift. I was disappointed in the appearance. It looks like a cheap copy. The cover is printed on poor quality paper as well as the print. I originally had the book and it had pictures of the locale as well as the characters which are missing in this copy. I am reluctant to give this as a gift.
3,Solid but never involving,A well researched book on an interesting case of murder and revenge. The characters are well drawn and book is a good one. It just lacks whatever it is that makes the best true crime books gripping.
5,One of the best true crime works ever written,"This book was given to me when I was a 13 year old living outside of Houston TX. It was the book that launched my fascination with true crime books of high quality (i.e. Darcy O'Brien,Vincent Bugliosi). I am still fascinated by the case and have heard many rumors in the last 20 years about the actual cause of death. Amazing - that this story still haunts me all these years later. It is out of print and I own a copy I have never lent out for fear of never seeing it again! Also interesting was Ann Kurth's Prescription:Murder which is her side of the case. Not even close to the same caliber as Blood & Money but still interesting. I cannot recommend this book highly enough - find it at the library or a used book store immediately!"
5,a must have,This book shows the evolution of video games. It shows how Donkey Kong looked on Atari(a dark fuzzy ugly thing) to the way he looks on Game Cube's Super Smash Bros.(much more detailed and graphically lovable). It doesnt say things like oh Atari is horrible because its old or SNES is dumb because its more than 10 years old. It simply shows how things got more sophisticated and better looking in time. The whole book is a must see. I hope that in the next life I get to play every single game listed in this book. It shows the story of Mario and Link as well as Sonic The Hedgehog.
3,Almost great,"The book itself is good, but the binding fell apart not to long after purchasing it (and i'm not rough with my books at all). To pay (...) dollers for a book it seems as though you should at least get a decent binding!"
4,The real jim Brown,This Spike Lee documentary is a real look into who Jim Brown is in his words and the words of people who knew him.
4,"Wonderful, enlightening","So much fascinating information about the human bio electrical system, and how even the tiniest current of electricity can effect it. I couldn't stop reading it. Every chapter opened my eyes wider to the possibilities for creating health even with the amount of current contained in the impulse of a faint thought or intention.I wish the print were a bit larger and the pages not so shiny, because it made it harder to read. Otherwise a very great book!"
5,Stop Bullies in their Tracks!!,"Build a Winning Self Image (Volume 1)Jonathan Parker, Ph.D., guides you with warmth & compassion as you discover ""change your self-image & change your life."" ""The quality of your life actually reflects the image you have of yourself."" This is so true. ""Your relationships, your work, your financial position, & even your mental, emotional & physical well-being is powerfully affected by your self-image."" You attract people & situations that mirror what you deeply feel about yourself. It's time to remove all the negative beliefs & acknowledge that you have worth & deserve to have respect & love & success in your life. I found this program to be enlightening & useful in creating a more positive outlook & be accepting of myself."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I obtained 2 of these lights. Both led lights failed after about 1 month. The great thing is that they have a lifetime warranty. Bad thing is I sent them to manufacturer (Victorinox Swiss Army) in for warranty repair/replacement of lights 10 weeks ago with no response from manufacturer. I emailed them and got an auto response that someone would be getting back to me shortly,...has been 12 weeks with no contact. Called manufacturer 6 weeks ago and they took my number and told me someone would get back to me, to this date no one from the manufacturer has contacted me. I would suggest that if you want a LED flashlight go with another brand. I hope that the Swiss army does not use these lights because they will be out of luck."
2,Victorinox C-Cell led Flashlight,Good quality flashlight but had some problems and tried to get some aswers from the factury and they won't even answer yourrequests. Very bad costumer service.
1,only lasted 1 year,"after about one year of use during which time I was always having to wiggle the head to get light it has completely quit.Checked batteries,cleaned connections.Nothing."
5,value of disc 2 puts this to the five star level,Okay...Matt Hughes autobiography is laughable and the first disc bio is a bit better but not super essential. The production isn't amateur like the BJ Penn bio but its not fabulous...it is a bit self serving although not as gag inducing as his book. The second disc however is truly worthy if you are looking to be schooled in a variety of MMA technique because you want to play around with it yourself...or if you are a fan of the sport and want a couple hour primer on all the elements that go into a fighters arsenal from stances to submissions and all points in between. These are both 16x9 widescreen and professionally filmed dvds. I don't regret this purchase and in comparison to many others I feel good keeping this at 5 star value at under 20 bucks.
1,AMATEURISH RUBBISH,I gave this one star as Amazon do not allow you to rate a film with no stars. Maybe it should be rated minus 10. Everything is dreadful about this film.The color is a mess in many scenes.The acting does not exist- in fact you cringe when watching most of the performances.Lazy script and the director (maybe there wasn't one?)is as mundane as the actors are.You know the film is going to be bad as there is no name or address on the sleeve of the company who released the dvd .Isn't that illegal?
5,creativity at its best!,"amazing, i love the song ""Entrance to Exit"" as it feels like a Tornado is consuming your very presense. The molody creates a fast merry go round tornado effect that sweeps you away."
3,analogue bubbles,The best tracks here? analogue bubblebath and isoprophlex.The other two tracks are okay but sound a bit dated(what did you expect?)You can compare it to some of his work under the ''caustic window'' alias.Still very nice and for the aphex collector a must have.
3,More Selection of music...,"The CD is very cute and my son loved it however, I wish there were a few more songs for him to listen to. The ones available on this CD were all pretty much the same tune over and over."
3,"Essays, NOT the Trilogy","Please note that this is a collection of 13 essays on the trilogy by E. Nesbit, not the trilogy itself!"
3,I expected more...,"I only own two of his records, ""The Best of..."" and ""Secrets"" so maybe I don't know enough about him to be fair. However, I eagerly anticipated the release of this album and bought it the day it came out. I was dissapointed. It lacked the angry statements and hard hitting commentary of the work I was familiar with. At some points, it sounded like he was bored while recording this, and that feeling gets put off on the listener. When can we get ""Secrets"" on CD?"
5,Invaluable Insights,"The Leadership Investment gives invaluable insights into the executive development and education programs of some of the best companies in the world. Each chapter delves deeply into the benefits of offering education programs, how these programs are set up in six of the worlds top companies, and how the programs continue to grow and change with the times. These first chapters are a helpful guide to any company looking into setting up a corporate education program. Perhaps the most interesting sections of the book are the sections on leadership development firms and corporate universities, in that these sections reveal an alternative route to executive development. This book will be incredibly useful to any company in its efforts to set up a leadership development program."
4,Same Toner as Box Stores,This is same toner as box stores for 30% less. So far no complaints... I initially thought my old HP laser printer was dying but it just needed new toner.
1,Peruvian Maid?,"I wanted to enjoy ""To Repel Ghosts"" so much. I have seen many of Jean Michel basquiats paintings and drawings. He was as poetic visually as he was when writing his thoughts down. Kevin Youngs book suffers because he seems to want to live through Basquiats words...but that is all that they seem to be is words...without soul!!!!"
2,To Repel Ghosts and Mortals too!,I found To Repel Ghosts interestingly cryptic. Although Kevin Young is a fine writer whom I've favored in the past. There seems to be no growth or honesty in his writing. There are passages that are riddled with the voice of someone elses soul. It is not that of artist Jean Michele Basquiat. It is of Young trying to capture himself as something more than Young. I have seen many young writers fall into this dilema. It is unfortunate that Kevin Young try to romantazise a troubled artists life. Maybe because his own was such a privileged one.
2,MORE GOOD WRITING?,"WOW, I have read all the previous reviews on Kevin Youngs' To Repel Ghosts and I hear two etremely different views. I read the book. I did not buy it and thought it was not worth buying. I agree that it is pretentious and nothing more than a romantic way of looking at Basquiat. I also agree that one doesn't need to be poor to write about the poor but the flip side to that is to understand more and not simply romanticise or exploit. Like painter, Julian Schnabels' film adaption of Basquiat(titled the same! I apploud those who champion Youngs' work. They are fighting for a voice that repels more than ghosts."
2,STREET ROMANCE ??????,"I read to Repel Ghosts and thought it was okay. It is a bit phony for someone like Kevin Young who comes from such a privileged life to write about street life as if he had ever experienced it. I sure did and this book felt like it totally romanticized Basquiat. I found little in Kevin Youngs own words. This book simply gives you a safe and untrue moment that is in a way enough for many, but not sincere enough for me."
3,"EASY-TO-USE; YET, UNPREDICTABLE: IT BEHAVES LIKE A GHOST.","Symantec had PC home-users in mind when she designed this ""Norton Ghost 2003"". It is an easy-to-use utility tool, which works fine if it likes your system configuration, but may furnish you with endless nightmares if it is unhappy with the state of your computer.Although the software is flexible enough as to allow you freehand in data back-up and system recovery, upgrading tasks are often unpredictable. The documentation manual of this ""Norton Ghost"" claimed that MS-DOS files in a disk created in Windows XP have no problems with the software, but the reverse is the case. The name of this software was carefully chosen: indeed, it behaves like a ghost! And, Symantec's technical support advisers will either refer you to their haphazard website, or to your documentation manual. Don't count on their support!"
1,"Poor support, won't backup to external drive....","I bought this program because it was advertised as being able to backup an image to external firewire devices...... EXCEPT the ever so popular Maxtor drives which I happen to own 2 of. So, since I always want to keep my image stored off of my actual pc, I need (16) cd's and spend a lot of time swapping out discs when I want to update my image which takes a couple hours out of my day. It sure would have been nice to know the ""fine print"" BEFORE spending good money."
1,This product is dead as far as Symantec support is concerned,"Like alot of developers all i needed was a basic imaging tool, nothing fancy and after reading how everyone swore by 2003 i bought the product. Bad move as symantec NO LONGER SUPPORTS NORTON GHOST 2003. This product is dead as far as Symantec support is concerned. To quote there web site ""We no longer provide technical support for Norton Ghost 2003. To continue receiving support, we suggest that you upgrade to the latest version of Norton Ghost, which we offer to previous users at a discounted price.""You are pretty much on your own or at the nercy of message boards as far as installing or degugging this version and believe me i had quite a bit of debugging to do on this product especially as i run MS XP Pro SP 2.I therefore agree with a previous reviewer who stated that selling this product is a ripoff,"
1,Do not buy for Windows XP,"1 star is too much for this product. It is completely incompatible with Windows XP, and technical support is very slow and utterly useless. The program always crashes under XP and has never worked regardless of whether you run it from DOS or Windows. I have contacted technical support through email over 10 times, and they consistently repeat the same suggestions that I had already tried on my own. They do not even bother to keep a record of what they have already tried. I have not bothered to pay the $30 to call technical support for more useless suggestions. While I have wasted my money on a product that has never worked, I hope that you will learn from my mistake and buy something else. If you have ideas for a working alternative for backing up an entire hard drive, please post them here."
2,Booooo to Symantec,"I have programmed and installed PC software for over 15 years. Most of my experience is using Ghost with Win98. I spent many, many hours learning how to use this product. IN MY OPINION: the user instructions are very poor, and the program has a few serious flaws that have caused me great PAIN.After installing Ghost 2003 on a plain XP machine, it crashed from the first start-up.No more Symantec for me."
4,Do you really need this program?,"It's easy to get lost in all that is needed for your computer with the ample amount of products offered from Symantec. For the money, I would suggest buying Norton Systemworks as it covers all Norton programs such as firewall,anti-virus,ghost,utilities and much more. Paying for a program such as this separately for the money doesn't seem worth it. Norton's interface/software is very easy to use and well done though I find little use for the Ghost system on personal computers. Most things that can be saved can easily be done on disc and to save a complete system is great, but how often do you do such a thing? Ghost is a great idea if you have the money to spare as you'll have very little use for it on your system. I give it 4 stars as it's a great product, runs well and is put together but as far as usefulness, I would spend the money on anti-virus."
1,Ghost backups failed,"I have been using Norton products for many years to keep my Hard drives working. Ghost has failed me. I backed up my Hard Drive 3 times using Ghost and when I had to recover from a corrupt MBR, none of the backups worked."
2,Old dos stuff,"Is very iffy when it comes time to recover your images. Works well most of the time, but is finicky enough to really hurt sometimes. Error messages are very cryptic. I have to use it because we have images made for this version. We are trying to convert to a newer (Ghost 15) version, now."
1,Does not work with many common DVD +R Drives,"Only a limited number of DVD +R drives are supported, for example it does not work with my TDK 420N. Symantec Tech Support's suggested solution: ""Buy a different drive""."
3,Machine design,"This book is essentially written for technology studnets rather than engineering students. Though the book covers all the topics that are normally included in a traditional machine design book, it eliminates most of the scientific and rigorous examination of the theories that are required to understand the design process. Thus it is suitable for technology students who can directly apply the formulae without knowing the way these have been arrived at. Many of the formulae are also highly simplified. It would have been better if the book has included more practical information which would have helped a practicing engineer."
3,A surprisingly varied melange,"Is this really R&B? I can't tell the difference between it at rap if it is. I enjoy far more the few novelty tracks, especially the practically ambient techno ""D*votion"". They mix humor nicely and sample creatively, which is unfortunate in that no particular crowd will notice them. Worth a look."
3,Music to the eyes,"I bought this book on a friend's recommendation. When it arrived, I opened it and cried: ""No! It's nonfiction!"" Okay, I'm a ""novel"" addict. But this book is entertaining as well as beautiful. Thad Carhart takes the reader into his own, off-the-beaten-track Paris neighborhood as well as sharing his passion for the piano. All I really wished for throughout was a little less of Thad and a little more of his family. I loved learning about the owner of the shop, but how about more of Thad's personal dynamics? It was, after all, a very personal story, but it ended up leaving out a big piece of who he was. And for me it turned out to be rather more than just a good read. It inspired me to find a piano teacher again. And when a friend told me he'd recently bought a Fazioli, I actually knew what he was talking about."
4,The Piano Shop on the Left Bank,"This book was chosen for our tennis club's monthly book and the review from all was ""enjoyed"" by all!"
4,makes you want to learn piano,"even if you don't know much about pianos, you will love this book. carhart breaks down the history of the piano and the workings of it, so that even the pdestrian will get it. but that's not all...he also has an interesting relationship with one of the piano repairers. the pianos themselves become living, breathing beings over the course of the story. and any story set in paris, has to be at least half decent. thad talks about the people and the places in the city and paints a perfect picture...the parts where he talks about taking piano lessons as a child, reminds me of when i played trombone in middle school. music meant the world to him as it does to me. this book is a treasure...."
2,book club reading,"There just was not enough plot to carry my interest through this book. The continuous exploration of the history, construction and care of pianos was of some interest, but not enough to carry an entire book for me."
2,Unimposing light reading,"I bought this book because it was required for the piano class I was taking. It was entertaining and evocative at the very beginning, but once the initial conceit wears out its welcome, the book becomes quite tiresome and even boring. It goes on and on without really having anything left to say."
2,Boring,Carhart held my serious attention for about the first third of this book that then begins to ramble in such a way that makes it difficult to even finish. Then the reader is confronted with a totally unnecessary question/answer session that seems to me a waste of paper in addition to being self-serving.
2,Following in a worn out tradition.,One of the longest 242-page books ever published. An advertising executive gives up his job and moves to Paris to become A Writer. He discovers a shop in his quartier which repairs pianos - people who actually still make things with their hands. Quaint or what? (Soon to become a minor television drama.)
5,Fascinating,"As a violinist, and not a pianist, I found this book fascinating. It's interesting to try and understand the nuances that go into making or refurbishing a piano. The author, as an amateur pianist, doesn't get too detailed because I'm sure it would be over his head. He does appreciate what goes into it though, which is what he parlays through the book. I imagine it would be a fairly difficult read for someone who's not a musician, but I think the core audience of this book is musicians, specifically pianists."
3,Anyone with a love for pianos might like it,"It wanders and meanders and is a bit abstract, narrow and anectdotal, but interesting in places and nicely written - especially the French."
3,Re-discovering what's important.,"An enjoyable read even for a reader unfamiliar with pianos or playing music who gained a better understanding of both through the author's rediscovery of a long-lost joy. I skipped a part or two that seemed to bog down - went back to them later - this is the kind of memoir that doesn't demand a linear read, the vignettes can be picked up and savored anywhere along the way.A small intimate story free of any attempt to impress, Piano Shop earns its keep for sincerity and the pleasure of accompanying the author on a meaningful search - and for the prodding it provides to anyone who has lost touch with what it means to learn and practice an art. An added bonus are the refrains of French life caught from apartment windows, in music classes, in the ateliers of neighborhood shops.All in all, a good book for those times when you feel the need to slow down and reconnect with simple pleasures."
4,Delightful!,"There is a class of books- of which this is one- that are neither great works of literature nor of great historical, philisophical or scientific import, yet are so delightful that you gladly make a place for them in your library. Books like Lawrence Wechsler's ""The Museum of Jurassic Technology"", Rinker Buck's ""Flight of Passage"" or John McPhee's ""Oranges"", that take a little corner of the world and tell a story in vivid detail.This is, nominally, a book about a little piano shop in Paris, and the author's rediscovery of his love for pianos and piano music. Pianists and musicians in general will understand, but you needn't be either to appreciate it- any more than you'd need to be a pilot to enjoy ""Flight of Passage"" or an orange to enjoy the McPhee book. Carhart paints such a vivid picture of the places and people he encounters that you may well find yourself imagining that you, too, are sitting in that atelier one Friday afternoon."
3,A Pleasant Read,"Contrary to some reviewers, I do think this book will appeal most to those who play and love the piano. The human story of relationships between the author, the piano shop owners, piano teachers and other characters is well told and interesting and so is the feel for the real Paris (from a resident's perspective) that we get. However, there is a lot of technical information about pianos as well as a good deal of history of the instrument. I have played and loved the piano for nearly 35 years and really enjoyed those parts, but I have to believe they would be rough on someone who doesn't love or appreciate the instrument, its history and its musical repertoire.The book does make me long for the day when I can buy a home and finally buying the grand piano I've always dreamed of."
1,Beyond boring,"The only reason I read the whole book ---- a dear friend gave it to me. It was dread awful, boring and it made me cranky for wasting my time. I gave the book back to my friend without comment and asked her opinion after she read it. Her comment was she will never trust the recommendation again of the patient who told her about it. Guess that says it all."
2,Watch it with the sound turned off,"There's some good footage here, although not much new for anyone who's seen other documentaries on the Russian front. The numerous errors really start to become irritating after a while though. Not only factual and historical errors, but even basic geography, such as: [paraphrase] ""The Soviet North front would attack through the Balkans [?] and defend Leningrad."" How about the ""Ju-88 Stuka?"" Or ""the Panzer III had a top speed of 18 mph?"" Who edits this stuff? The anachronistic use of footage is also extremely annoying, although fairly common in WWII documentaries, such as showing Tiger tanks or Henschel 129s while talking about Barbarossa. For the price it's not bad if you want to see some historical war footage, but if you want accuracy this isn't the one."
5,Riveting suspense...,"As I'm not an avid reader, after starting this book I couldn't put it down... The characters grabbed my interest and held on... Looking forward to the sequel."
5,Gatlin Bros.,I have so many of the gatlin Bros. CD's and I plan on getting more to go with my collection.
2,Faulty Disc,This is a great sing-a-long Christmas tunes grouping but the disc we ordered was damaged and did not work successfully on most songs.
3,Disappointing,"While credible in basics, this work does little to fully explore the battle. It is sadly deficient in enumerating the activities and names of French regulars and militia. It does bless the reader with photographs of the fix-bayonet sequence of period British regulars (whatever that has to do with anything).Not equal with other Osprey volumes (René Chartrand's Monongahela for example)."
3,Interesting account but,"While I was reading the book, I was suprised at how little the French side was covered. It was as though the French didn`t even fight, and just let the British bow them over. I felt that a bit more balanced coverage of the campaign would have been better. Having only the colors of the French metropolitian regiments shown as a representation of the French forces was too little. Of all of the Osprey books that I have bought, this one is probobly the one that I am most disappointed in. It was a fair account of the British side, but even that, I found it annoying that the depection of a member of the 13th Regt as a stand in for other regiments in the campaign was a bit off. There are plenty of North American British reenactors of regiments in that campaign which could have been used. I`m currently a Masters student and if I had submitted something like this for a paper, I would probobly fail."
1,What are they thinking?,What is this company thinking to put out a pricey DVD that looks like the worst public domain VHS rip? Do they think customers are blind? This is really making me angry. Never again I will buy a MYA DVD. Too bad.
4,funny clock,Sent this clock to son-in-law for a birthday gift. He loves the Simpsons. He said at each hour it says something and it is very funny. The family is enjoying it... It is going up in his office.
2,Can't judge a whole album by the radio singles alone,"The lead singer is German and the rest of the group members are from Spain. I've seen them labeled as a Mexican rock group more than a few times. Guess you'd better call them European. The guys got a distinctive voice, no doubt, and getting the French import version with 25 tracks makes the most sense financially. Problem is, most of their work is nothing like the big radio song or the Nuggets II included ""Going Nowhere"". If more of the tracks sounded like those two upbeat rockers you'd have a tasty CD here."
1,totally awful,"I ordered this cd only to find that it was only one song and it was dance music the cd cover was a home recording Ieventually ot my money back but had to return to Germany at my expense, do not purchase."
3,one hit wonders or a little more ?,"I don't think Los Bravos had another hit in their life than Black is Black, and I don't really know where the extra tracks are coming from, but anyway...I bought this album when it was first released mostly because it was very cheap (at least in Brussels). I loved the title track and I listened to the rest with interest. It was a spanish group, but the singer was german and he sang in english (for marketing reasons) with an incredible accent that made, I imagine, a lot for the success of the single. The opening riff was also a good idea.It's a funny souvenir for me, but I must admit that it doesn't stand the test of time too well..."
5,wonderful read,"Wonderful read. If you like odd, off-center humor, and espeically if you know a little Spanish, this ia great read."
5,Excellent combo of goth and industrial sounds,"This is a great album for those who enjoy a moody, dark sound. It includes what I would call goth and industrial/electronic bands. Some of the familiar ones are KMFDM, Miranda Sex Garden, Fear Factory, and Godflesh. It is a bleak combination of dark, spooky gothic sounds and some good industrial thumping. It also contains three classical/choral pieces from the movie which are beautifully haunting. This is a good album, period, but especially for a soundtrack."
4,Dark & Haunting,"This album is a blend of dark sounds that totally befit the mood of the film. From KMFDM to Peace, Love & Pitbulls to Front Line Assmebly, the soundtrack provides a sinister and appropriate tone that any fan of industrial music should appreciate."
2,Not what I expected,"Quality of this poster was not exactly what I expected, the poster is a little blurry. However, the person who received this as a gift loved the poster."
2,Not a great bike,"I was distracted by the brand name of this bike, but in actuality it was not a great purchase. The quality was just not great and it was quite heavy. I think Kettler do better with their trikes and scooters."
4,Very Good,"I haven't heard much by this band, but my friend played this CD for my and I really liked it. One thing I did notice was that the melody of the song ""Here We Go Again"" is almost a complete copy of Blink 182's song Dammit. Parts like that lack originality, but otherwise a good album."
2,Nowhere near as good as their first two albums,"I thought the first two albums by SR-71 were pretty good. Unfortunately, this third release is not up to par with their previous efforts. Their first two albums had a unique sound that set them apart from the large number of young punk bands that have debuted in recent years. This album is a change for the worse with very mediocre cookie cutter punk music that sounds like a hundred other bands out there. Save some money and pick up their first two non import albums. You'll get a lot more good music for less money."
4,Better than Expected,I have a couple SR-71 songs on MP3 which I like and went to Amazon to sample the songs on this CD.After hearing the samples I decided to buy 'Here We Go Again'After listening to the CD I was not disappointed. SR-71 is a pop punk band with an edge.The songs are well written with a smooth punk sound.The CD is well produced and sounds goodI liked all the songs and to me its one of those CDs that the more you play the better it gets
4,SR71's latest album....more of the same,"This is the band's latest CD release and its more of the same alt rock with a splash of punk and post teen angst thrown into the mix. The album is 'Here We Go Again', and for me the songs were a tad to punkish for me but was still enjoyable to listen too. The artwork of the CD cover could have been done better. I purchased this CD through Amazon.com and it was a pleasure to do so cause I know I will always get a pretty fast delivery. This band has still alot of experience to glean and needs more time to evolve. The song '1985' that was made famous by the group 'Bowling For Soup' is a far superior version on this album. Another enjoyable and worthwhile song to listen too is 'All American'. This CD would be great and would blend in nicely as background music for a teenage party."
2,There's a Reason You've Never Heard of this Book,"Ferber fans will be disappointed by this derivative book. It contain snatches of the themes and characters of her other novels, without their heart or cohesiveness. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,This CD does it....,"""Wow"", was the first thing I said. I first heard this doing college radio and loved it. There is hardly any other artist that could possibly touch what Spookey was doing. He has a great voice and everything musically is so unique and fits so perfect. Actually, this guy belongs in a looney bin in Canada. He is from Canada though... I have noticed lately that most of my favorite things are coming out of Canada."
5,Modes of elevation to a next level,"If you're the kind of person who's looking for something innovative and avant garde, without going straight to the fully electronic world, then you gotta check out this album. Spookey Ruben is the kind of musician who creates a whole sound concept, rather than single songs, in a funny, eclectic, sometimes ethnic and unique way. Keep an eye on this guy, because he and his music are far out of this world. ..."
4,a definite buy. good cd.,"This is a really good album. It is not perfect, some of the tracks bug me, maybe one or two of them. But in general, it is very interesting music. The kind you don't get bored of after 100 listenings. There's always a reward for listening again. Some of the best songs are: These Days Are Old, my fave, i love it; Leave the City, superb, beautiful; It's Not What You Do, It's You; The Size of You;I am very happy to own this cd, and you will be too."
1,This guy is nuts!!,"i think i`m the olny person in this universe, who bought this cd, its on sale, 5 box people interest have to come to Caracas."
5,The Wrath of Khan,"This is my favorite Star Trek movie novelization. It contains so much more than a play-by-play of the movie, but it also delves into tremendous characterization.. In the novel, Peter Preston Engineer's Mate is so much more. The reader also becomes aware that the young cadet is also the son of Scotty's sister. This revelation gives so much added meaning to the scene in which the chief engineer brings in the young man's charred remains after Khan's surprise attack. The theatrical release gives little more than Bones' heart-felt apology. The network television showing (which would appear from time to time on ABC) added scenes which did bring out this important plot point, but this has not been shown for many years. Why not issue a Director's Cut of this a la the original Motion Picture DVD. It would bring so much added meaning to this already classic film."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"As far as novelisations go, this one is pretty decent. It helps that the underlying event is a fairly entertaining star trek epic, as well, as we get K vs K, Kirk vs Khan, one of those old enemies from the past conjured into being type of confrontations.Throw in Kirk's kid, and a dead pointy eared science officer and there is plenty to keep the interest."
1,VIETNAM GARBAGE,I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew.
4,cherry hill does it again,"a very good book, with very detailed pictures. would recommmend to any one that has a horse stable, or is thinking of building one."
5,Great Photos and Advice,"I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to set up and organize proper, clean, safe and efficient care for horses. The pictures are great, and make it a lot easier for the beginner to visually see what works. It's an excellent resource!"
5,Cheaper than Bookstores,My daughter need this book for an online course and it was much cheaper then getting it through the school bookstore.
4,Most impressed!,I was pleased with my purchase. I received a book in almost new condition. I was expecting the worse but got the best.
1,Never again!!!,"Well, to start, I got this got this book two days ago. It came about three weeks after I had originally ordered it. Mind you that this product was coming from one state away and in the time it took to arrive I could have walked there and back several times over. Furthermore, I am a college student and not having this book for three weeks left me unable to study for two tests nor able to do my homework for almost a month. I tried to reach the seller on three different occasions and never received a response from them. The product was not up to the descriptions standards, but was in fair enough conditions and I would personally never do business with this seller again."
5,"John Wayne movie ""Angel & the Badman","This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies. It really shows a kinder, softer side of the Duke. A very sweet show for the entire family to watch."
1,Fuzzzzzzzzzzy 1999 Delta Entertainment Corp. LazerLight DVD,Very bad copy. Dark and fuzy. The special edition part is just a short clip of Tony Curtis standing behind a directors chair. He's so fat he can't button his jacket. Don't know what's worse the movie transfer or Tony's rug. Save your money and pass on this one.
1,Angel and Badman/John Wayne on Film,"Advertised online as colorized and was not. Supposed to be transferred from best possible source but quality was rotten!! Oh well, I only paid one penny for it so it wasn't too bad to just throw it in the trash can!!!"
3,Not bad,"I got this for my 18 month nephew who loves to play with adult things, and loves to watch adults sweep. This broom is a perfect size for him, but my only complaints are that in big white lettering on the handle it says ""made in china"" . The print makes the broom look cheap. Also, the bristles are plastic, not like a real broom. Not bad though, a little over priced, but I think my little buddy will have great fun with it regardless."
4,Nice small broom,"I bought this broom for my broom-obsessed young (18 mo) toddler. He drags this thing everywhere! The broom seems to be holding up pretty well, although the bristles are really frayed. The only thing I don't like about it is that it leaves streaks of blue paint on the linoleum floor and on the walls if it happens to slide down the wall (like if the broom gets set up against the wall and falls over). Other than that, seems to be ok. The reason I chose this one is because it was the smallest one I could find (less than 30 inches)."
4,"Decent Quality, Fun for my Toddler","The quality of this broom is pretty good. The packaging, however, was kind of huge. My daughter is almost three years old, and we have clean up time a couple times a day where we sweep and do the dishes. She was always a big helper with the dishes part by setting her stool beside the sink, but she didn't really get into the sweeping until I bought this little broom for her. I think it should last a while - probably a couple years with constant use. It seems to actually sweep well, also, which will be great when she is a little older and has a bit more control."
2,Not Corn,"I know it's been said before, but the bristles are not of a natural material. Why didn't I read the reviews before purchasing? This broom works but it is not inspiring. My expectations were too high!"
3,Best for older children,"Purchased this because our 2 yr.old loved sweeping our patio! Although it is a lovely & realistic broom.. it is VERY delicate. The straw bristles break off so easily. This broom is more suited for an older child. Also it could have been packaged much better. It came in a box with no plastic wrap of any kind, left to bounce around in the large box.The cost wasn't too bad ($7-$8), but the shipping was another $7.00 !"
2,SO DISAPPONTED,MY OWN FAULT FOR NOT READING THE FULL DESCRIPTION. BROOM IS CUTE TO LOOK AT. BRISTLES ARE SO FIRM THAT THEY BREAK OFF WHEN USED TO SWEEP. THEY SPREAD OUT VERY QUICKLY. CAME IN A HUGE BOX AND HAD BROKEN BRISTLES ON ARRIVAL. THEY ACTUALLY HURT IF YOU PUSH AGAINST. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR A VERY YOUNG CHILD. MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER DOES LOVE TO SWEEP BUT DOES GET FRUSTRATED WITH IT WHEN THE BRISTLES BREAK OFF. KEEP AWAY FROM PETS.
1,May as well be a huge blue wall crayon,"The broom is ok, but if you have light colored walls, you will have blue marks EVERYWHERE. It's not worth it. If you must have this broom. sand down the end of it until the paint is gone."
3,.,"We haven't had the same experience as the other reviewer- our broom seems to be very sturdy. The bristles are very firm and more like the fibers of a rope than ""straw"". I didn't realize that when I bought it. I don't especially like that, but the kids don't care. My complaint is that the broom stinks. It actually smells. Ew."
5,A different perspective on lifestyle,"This book was a breath of fresh air. Most of what you read in the personal development genre seems to make you feel guilty for your lifestyle. This book tells you that you're okay and how to work with what you have to make your life even better. I was so inspired by the book that I recently went to Canyon Ranch in Tucson. That place is fantastic! The introduction in the book claims that they are trying to put the spa resort in a book in case you can't make it there. From first hand experience, I can say that this book really does sum up the philosophy and spirit of Canyon Ranch. I highly recommend this read."
4,Great product,If you can still get this stuff it is a must for the lil lady who is expecting. All of the product my wife has used from this company worked very very well. Best of all it made her happy and an happy wifey makes a happy home.
5,THE FACT IS...MICHAEL IS A GREAT STORYTELLER!,"If Your Dreams are Big Enough, The Facts Don't Count! is a wonderful story about a man with a disability living his life and telling about it in his own words! I read it in ONE day! This book is inspirational to ALL human beings!"
1,Waste of money,"These do not help what-so-ever. The guy is impossible to follow, very basic. HE just just reads an outline to you. If you intend on passing the exam, do not settle with this material. Save your money for Becker. That is the only way you will pass"
3,Not bad for a personal game room.,"This little machine is decent for your own personal game room or man cave, just don't do any real vending with it.It keeps drinks fairly cool. Not as cold as a real vending machine, but noticeably cool. The quarter mechanism works ok, but has a glitch where you can stick the quarter in halfway and the machine buttons activate while you are still holding the quarter, allowing you to hit the button and grab a drink without paying.There is storage for 8 vending drinks, 2 backup cold drinks in the middle, and 2 in the front display (these two will not be cooled).Build is mostly plastics, not much metal at all. Not a problem for home use though. I've had it in my game room for close to a year with no problems."
1,"Fun idea, but...","I bought this about a year ago, it was very, very discounted. (How about $10. seriously!)The unit has the ability to vend two different 12oz can products. It holds four cans for each product. It works almost like a real vending machine. The coin slot really works, it has a refrigeration unit, and it does dispense product.It worked fine for eleven months. Unfortunately, the power board went bad. This makes the whole unit inoperable.I contacted Koolatron, they offered to send a replacement board for $50.Oh well, for $10 it was fun while it lasted."
1,"Cheaply made, plastic novelty item. DO NOT BUY!","I bought this item from Home Depot on sale. You get what you pay for.1. The coin slot has never worked.2. The unit doesn't cool very well. It only has a peltier cooling unit, not a real compressor.3. The fan started making noise on mine within a week or so and it finally just died completely.Be forewarned. Don't buy it. It's a complete waste of money."
3,Okay,"I love Fall Out Boy, they're my favorite band, but it's an EP, so I can't find it in myself to love it much. I like good sound quality, and good music quality, and it didn't really have either. Good songs though, they do grow on you."
2,Blah,I'm sure that If Fall Out Boy remade this album now Ii'd probably be better than what this turned out like.The end
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,"this is their best cd. evening out and take this to.. are the besst. afer that, with cork tree, they just became loser sellouts. this one is the best because pats voice is different, and i think they had 5 people in the band. plus i'm a huge fob fan, so i have like everything, so yeahbest songs are PARKER LEWISCALM BEFORE THE STORMANDPRETTY IN PUNK"
2,Not so Good,"I love their Cd Take This to Your Grave but this Cd is nothing combare to that Cd. They were just bad. I felt ripped off and I so want my money back. They are a good band however so I got another one of their Cd's called, My Heart Will Always Be B-Side to my Tongue wich is one of their better Cd's. They didn't dissapointment. Get that Cd instead."
2,As Pete Wentz Says....,"Even Pete Wentz (plays bass/writes lyrics in FOB) describes Evening Out With Your Girlfriend as ""like the worst CD on the planet."" He's not being modest. I am a huge FOB fan, but this CD truly does suck. They didn't really know what they were doing back then, and, as other people have said, the harmonies clash all over the place. I like the lyrics (""Next time the phone can wring my neck, it gets no answer"") but don't buy this if you're expecting another Take This to You Grave, From Under the Cork Tree, or My Heart Will Always be the B-Side to My Tongue. If you are a freak like me, you might want to get it anyway, to complete your collection, but it's not the kind of thing you're going to want to hear 24/7."
2,"good album, but dont get this version","this is a great album, but dont buy this version!!! this was remixed and remastered without FOB's knowledge and re-released to the public. i tfeattures couple more songs than the original, but a real FOB fan will try to find the original version!!"
2,A non-Fanboy's review,"I'm going to start off by saying that I really dig Fall Out Boy's newest albums. I was just a little sickened that the fanboy earmuffs have gotten in the way of some people's reviews. This album is awful. The guitars are messy in parts where they should be clean, the vocals aren't loud enough and are instead drowned out by guitars when the vocals should be the mainpoint of a song, among other things. I can't recommend this to any person with ears unlness it was for collection's sake. Stay away from this and fall in love with ""Take This To Your Grave"" first, then come back to this album to see how far this band has grown."
5,Damn good,My friend played Take This To Your Grave one day in the car. I thought it was pretty good. It wasnt my favorite. But a few days later they showed me this. I listened not knowing it was the same band as before. I loved it. I looked up some of their other stuff and bought Take This a while later and I learned to respect them. They are talented its no doubt about it. I would definately look into this band if you like softer punk.
4,its not that bad,"mkay i'm a really big fan of fob so this review is like totlally biased but i really like this cd. other ppl r like well its not produced well. well,duh. they didnt have money for stuff like that and they were just kids! give em credit! u can still tell theyre good even if the production was bad!"
2,"Buy Take this to your grave, not this one","Im a huge fan of take this to your grave so when I was in the record store I figured this is probably pretty decent too. Not so, its like listening to an entirely different band. Its like nails on chalkboard to the ears when you compare it to take this to your grave, unbearable. Check out their newest EP if you want to add a fall out boy cd to your collection."
4,Not as bad as the other reviewers say,"I've had this CD for some time now & was reading reviews for curiosity's sake. The other reviewers don't give it eough credit. It of course isn't as good as ""Take This To Your Grave"" or ""From Under The Cork Tree"" but something you should have if your a fan. Some one who doesn't love FOB may not appreciate is much but I love it.If you do decide to get it DO NOT BUY IT HERE $14 IS TOO MUCH. GET IT AT FYE OR SAM GOODY IT'S CHEAPER.I definately recomend it."
2,Only for FOB collectors,"Here we have Fall Out Boy, the biggest pop-punk band since Yellowcard, with some of their earlier efforts. In one listen it's easy to tell why they didn't get much press with it.In all honesty it sounds like a demo EP. Production quality is nowhere near their last two albums. Something is really smelly about the harmonies, they clash all over the place (maybe they didn't know exactly how to use them back then), and the lead guitar lines are pretty rank.Only recommended for the most devoted Fall Out Boy fans. For the average listener, pick up 'Take This To Your Grave', or their latest CD, 'From Under The Cork Tree', instead of this. You'll thank yourself for it."
1,E A S Y F I X ... !!! ...Works great untill it stoped working,"While in record mode, standby... point camera at bright sun or bight light bulb at close distance ... It may take five minutes but my camera started working again... !!! Alleluia!! Seems I have to do this every time I use the camera, but I am happy that this works even though it is less than desirable...Samsung SCD23 seems has a common problem... I have used it infrequently for 3 yrs and It has worked fine until now. All of a sudden and for no reason at all, the LCD went blank and will not record any image. This is due to a faulty CCD??? Still plays tapes and records video... My childrens ""hot Wheels"" camcorder lasted better than this one!!!! My new baby is starting to walk and I..."
3,"OK, but Mediocre Video","A really nice unit functionally, easy to use, lots of features, large battery, inexpensive, but.. Video quality leaves something to be desired. There seems to be a cross hatching, especially at low light levels. Color is relatively drab. I compared it to a Panasonic PV-DV102 pretty closely, with the same scenes, location, lighting. The Panasonic colors are much more vibrant and realistic-it was easy to see(wife, daughter readily agreed). Also, the SCD23 field of view is pretty small, so you can't take good movies in a small room. Its too bad, because it beats the Panasonic otherwise."
1,Avoid at all costs! CCD goes out!!!,"When I first got this as a gift from my father-in-law I was verypleased. Lots of cool features, easy to use, etc etc etc. But oneday after probably 20 hours of use, the thing would no longerrecord video. It records sound and plays back ok, but no recordingvideo. I've researched the web and this sounds like it'svery common with this model. Samsung may get a class action lawsuitif they don't replace these faulty ccd's for free. This experiencehas made me decide to avoid samsung products in the future."
1,Not worth the money,"I've had scd minidv camcorder for 2 years and maybe used it a dozen times. One day I went to use it and it would not record. Anyhow, the lense broke (and no it was not droped or abused in any way).Samsung wants me to ship it to them with $150. A local repair shop charged $68 to look at it and declare the ccd or cdc (shutter) is broken and will cost $274 to replace. This is a huge disapointment and seems to be a pretty common issue with this model. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,another black screen of death!,"Yes, I am another victim of The black screen of death. I used my camcorder only 1 1/2years and my screen went black but I am also able to view recorded tapes. Samsung will only offer a refurbished camcorder for $150.00 cost to me. NO THANKS!!"
1,NEVER buying anything samsung again!,"This camcorder worked great the first 10 times i used it. Then it BROKE just like my 3 samsung cell phones and my samsung DVD player. Thank god i got the extended warranty on this camera. The manufactured supposedly repaired it..... took them 3 months to get it back to me. It worked fine one more time, then it broke again. Back to geek squad repair. Got it back i tested it, seemed ok. Went to use it later, broke again! Sent it back to geek squad..... got it back.... STILL BROKEN! After breaking 4 times I am getting a new camcorder under my extended warrany... NOT A SAMSUNG!"
3,"I love the camera, but what is with the video artifacting?","It appears that I am not the only one with this problem. I received this camcorder for Xmas. I love it. It fits nicely in my hand, is super easy to use, and connects easily to my computer to download thru the 1394 firewire cable. What I did notice today since it was the first day I decided to download video is how bad the video artifacting was. At several point the right 1/5 of the screen was totally funky. The sound hicups once in a while also. If anyone has found out what causes this, please email me. I love the camera and do not want to return it, but will if this cannot be fixed."
5,Good Value,"This camera is well worth the money. It includes the USB cable, which is very easy for the PC transfer."
3,"Light, Well Designed But. . .","I have tested this camcorder and found that inspite of it's shiny-slick adorable design, light weight and wonderfully low price, there are a few drawbacks to this unit. The number one drawback is something Samsung needs to work on; image stabilization! When fully zoomed-in (optical zoom) this camcorder performs notably worse than most of the other brands I've tested. You simply see much more shaking. Colors are also not as accurate as some of the Canons, Sonys and Panasonics I've looked at. Another minor inconvenience is that it has an external mic jack -- yet no headphone jack to moniter sound with. That said, it does have a small external speaker. This last point is only an issue for more involved video projects, not for casual vacation or home use. Macro close-ups look beautiful as with most cams. So if you want a basic camcorder that is very easy to use, don't mind your video being a little shaky (fine with a tripod of course) it may suit you fine."
1,Mine is good for about 30 hrs.,"After making 15 tapes, the CCD quit working. It just shows a blank screen or snowflicks. After reviewing another review, pointing the camcorder to a bright light make it works again. However, I do not like this unit anymore. If I really need it, I do not know if this will work or not. No more samsung for me."
5,great camera,"I just wanted to clear up some problems that some people have been having. First of all, the camera does accept more than a 16mb memory stick. I went to K-Mart and bought a 256mb Lexar memory stick and it works great. On the lowest picture quality (which is still excellent) I can hold a total of 5,052 pictures. It is really two sticks in one, and you flip a switch on the stick to go from one 128mb slot to the other. Everything else about the camera is perfect as well. I would suggest buying this camera from Best Buy, where you can get a service that allows you to bring in your camera every three months to be cleaned."
4,Nice Camera owned for 5+ years,"Purchased this camera over 5 years ago. It has been used and abused by two adults, two children and three dogs. It has been dropped, kicked, left in the rain, left in vehicle overnight(s) in -20F weather and kept on ticking. The only complainant is that the minidv tapes are cumbersome to burn to dvd unless you have a really good bug free dvd burner program. Recently pruchased a DVD burner/player which has made buring tapes to DVD much easier and negates the previous computer issues. Highly recommend getting the fast battery charger and extended run battery."
1,Thieves,"I bought this product about 1-1/2 years ago. Let LCD stopped displaying and it stopped recording picture. Turns out there is a defective part used by this, and many camcorders. All the other companies that use this defective part have had recalls.Turns out Samsung requires a $150 charge to fix.Know this.... This camcorder will break within 1-4 yearsA VERY LOW QUALITY PRODUCT. There is a class action suit forming. 614-886-4393"
2,Terrible video artifacting,"I got this camera because it was comparable in features and price to the Canon ZR-60, which was out of stock. This camera looks great on paper, but fails to deliver out of the box. Every scene I shot the video was broken and full of digital artifacts. I tried adding light and moving the camera slowly, but the artifacting still occured. I'll be taking this back and hopefully be getting the Canon."
1,Korean Made products,"Among Asian countries they don't rely too much in co-Asian manufactured goods because of poor quality ( except Japanese made) Sony, Canon & Panasonic still has the best quality among electronics.I don't know why samsung,hyundai, Daewoo etc. made it in the US Market that while in fact in Asia, these products are all a piece of Junk."
1,I too have been a victim of this LEMON,"You don't have to take my word for it - just do a quick internet search and you will find hundreds of people who had what is now known as BSOD (Black Screen of Death), a failure that occurs after a while and leaves you with a completely dark image in camera mode. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this unless you need it as paperweight."
4,A Very good camcorder,"My wife just brought the scd23. I like that it is lightweight and has a lot of functionality.In reading some of the past reviews, I understand that most users believe that the scd23 can only use a 16 meg memorystick. I guess I did not bother to read the instructions, cause I went out and brought a Lexur 64 meg stick and it works just fine.I look forward to putting it to use on my grandkids, I will let you know how things go with getting the pictures downloaded on to my computer later."
2,What a disappointment,"The very first video taken was my wedding (the camera was a gift) and the image is distorted. It takes great footage if it's on a tripod and not moved at all, but any time you move the camera at all the picture is all broken up in pieces. It looks great while recording and it isn't until playback that you realize it's awful. It doesn't happen every time, but I've had it 2 years and it happens more often than not. We think we have a great video of our daughter's first birthday or Disney vacation and then watch it and see half of it is distorted. What a disappointment!"
1,Bad camcorder,"I was not pleased at all with this camcorder. The video quality is very grainy especcially in low light. Although it is a compact easy to use camcorder the video quality is horrible. The USB connection is most frustrating as well. For me it diddnt even import the video, you cant get the computer to detect it either. I dont know if i have to get a firewire thing or what. I will not recomend this camcorder to knowbody."
5,Smells and Feels Great,"The Vanilla Amber Musk scent is warm and sensual and the oil itsels spreads nicely and is not thin and greasy, but nice and thick and smooth. Highly recommended to spice up the old love life!"
3,Great Test Light with a Handy feature,"Great test light, we use a couple of these daily, my only complaint and the reason I gave 4 stars, is because it needs a better strain relief where the plastic and cord meet. Over time, a unit will become intermittent and we have to either repair or replace it."
1,"I would like to give the book no stars, but","it's just not an option. I was surprised to learn that Ms. Lord lived in China at all since her work reveals such a shallow understanding of Chinese people. For a person born and lived in China, the plot of this novel is anything but plausible. Reading it was like watching an old Hollywood movie with static and distorted characters who are supposedly Asian. Just because an author looks Asian doesn't mean that she understands the culture. Being Chinese -- or a member of any other enthnic group -- is not a quality of appearance but of knowledge and experience. Ms. Lord seems to have neither...."
1,"ok, let us play up the stereotypes just a little more...",I'm surprised that Bette Bao Lord is considered a distinguished writer because her writing lacks cultural authenticity and creativity. All she does is harp on old and all too played-out stereotypes. Any reader who can manage to follow the grossly contrived and fairytale-like coincidence full plot till the end will feel like they've just wasted their eyesight and time on an all too long book that could have ended about 250 pages earlier. I don't think i'll be picking up another one of her books again.
4,really cool beats and solid lyrical content,"I saw this guy perform once, and thought I'd take a chance on the CD. I think its a real solid effort, the production is what does it for me. The samples he uses are ALL fresh, with feeling. The beats all have head-noddin rhythms too. The raps are pretty cool, the content is excellent (covers alot of topics everyone can relate too). The flow isn't the flavor of the month style, which is why I didnt give it 5 stars."
3,Dry v. Ultra Dry,"I used this snorkel on a recent trip to the Caribbean. I have previously used dry snorkels and did not notice much difference with the ultra dry. Despite the manufacturer's claim, I did get a small amount of water in my snorkel, but not enough to slow me down. I purchased this snorkel in pink - it comes with a very small mouth piece. My teeth and jaw hurt after an hour or so of snorkeling from clenching on the mouth piece and trying to hold it in my mouth. This was a quick, last minute purchase that served its purpose."
3,oceanic ultra dry snorkel,The snorkel is good. It does stay close to 100% dry. The two little pieces at the top pop off all the time. If you lose them the unit will not work
5,Great Snorkel,My son and I used these snorkels in Aruba and they worked excellent. Now the water was mostly calm but we got no water coming back into the tube. Very happy with this purchase and would buy from this vendor again.
4,snorkel stays dry,"this worked great. no water entered while we were snorkeling in the carribean. one thing I did notice was that you have to be careful of the angle it is at while using on the water surface. if you tip it to far forward, it will engage and you will not only not get any water in it, but no air either."
1,Not good at all in my case,"I got this item because i like swimming w/o having to to turn left and right to breath. I like the central mount idea.After one 2 weeks using it, it started leaking a huge amount of water so I had to surface and start breathing the old way ... I had to return it and now I am shopping for something real good quality"
5,Lives up to its name,"Just used it on 3 different free dives [to 20 feet], in the Caribbean. Got a few drops in it in choppy waters, but with the over-sized purge valve, it cleared easily. I've had other ""so called"" dry snorkles that leaked all the time, but the Oceanic Ultra Dry lives up to its name."
3,not ULTRA dry!,"tried this in the pool for the first time. FIRST BREATHE I almost choked on all the water in the tube! got better when I sharply exhaled upon surfacing. honestly it's not any better than my cheapo costco kit snorkel. I did notice that I really clenched down on the mouthpiece. that will get sore after a bit I'm sure. I may cut away some of the bite piece to allieviate the problem. I know this thing gets rave reviews and all, and thats why I bought it, but listen to the negative reviews, they are not lying. it's just not all that great and nothing special. it does the job, but dont expect some ultra dry snorkel cause this aint it."
5,Completely dry,"I used this snorkeling in Thailand for a week and it never failed to be completely dry. One thing to remember though is when coming up from out of the water, if you are gasping for air, it actually sucks the value shut on the snorkel, so you need to do a very brief exhale or even just not be sucking in when you surface for the value to open. Good mouth piece as well, a little small for me, but overall great snorkel."
5,Amazing snorkel!!!,"Really awesome snorkel. Sits high out of the water and closes well underwater. Definitely recommend, as it is better than other dry snorkels I have had due to the splash guard included in this one."
5,STOP IT!!!!!!!!,STOP GIVING CDS BAD RATINGS FOR A FLAWED CD OR FOR HAVING AMAZON ISSUES...ITS NOT THE BANDS FAULT!!!!!!!!
5,Swampy Finnish Troll Metal,"Lovely, heavy extreme black/folk metal. If I could give more than five stars I would. Recommended for fans of Korpiklaani, Turisas or any other folk metal band, it's darker and heavier than either of those two but with plenty of melody. This is the first album to feature Mathias Lillmns aka Vreth on lead vocals. Makes you want to dress in animal skins and run around in the forest dancing and drinking mead. A must have for any Finntroll fan!"
1,Not a CD,"BEWARE!This is not actually a CD. As a result of the copy protection on this CD, it is technically no longer a CD - indeed, nowhere on the CD or packaging is the Compact Disc Digital Audio logo with which we are all familiar.As a result, this will not play on any player I own. When I put it in my computer, the CDrom makes sickly clicking noises and spins up and down constantly. The DVD side works fine (in the same drive), but the CD portion is essentially broken.I like Fintroll as a band, but it's hard to rate a product that is inherently broken over one star."
1,Garbage,"I honestly believe it took Raymond Benson no longer than about 2 or 3 days to write this excuse for a novelization. Sure, novelizations are typically a waste of time, with the treatment done so simply and with no style, no extra drama, and little action, but this is the pits. Benson is not even a good enough writer for a screenplay novelization. He has zero style and zero feel for character. It's like he's describing the action as simply as he can and making it so distant that even as simple as the book is it becomes taxing to get through. Raymond Benson is the wrong choice for the new Bond writer and it's a damn shame. Watch Tomorrow Never Dies again. Don't even bother with this."
2,Your basic crappy movie novelization,"The only difference here is that Raymond Benson, who is now writing the Bond novels penned this one. The problem with Benson is not his knowledge or understanding of James Bond but HIS WRITING. It's bad. Bottom line. The guy is a lousy prose writer, sounding like a high school English student in his explanations of scenes and descriptions. There is not an iota of drama or even action here. It's just plain wording of scenes on a page. This book is only of interest to big fans of the movie (which was top-notch Bond) and of the novels (for completists, as Benson's other 2 novels blow this turkey away.)"
3,Very Good. Just like the movie but it was a page turner.,"Even though this book is a movie tie-in, doesn't mean it can't be good, and a little different than the movie. I was 11 years old when I read that book and I read it in 3 and 1/2 days. I couldn't stop reding it. (Now I'm 12) This book is definetly one of my favorites!"
2,UHH.........NO,I loved the movie so I wanted to check out the book. The book was very hard to follow. The action was good but the whole time I was reading I had no clue what was going on. I didn't finish the book because it was too confusing. It had a lot more than the movie did but I still think it's not worth buying but if you really want to read it i strongly reccomed checking it out from the library.
1,Not compatible with the autoclose configure gate,"Whilst this description says it is compatible with the Kidco configure gates, I purchased these exensions with my Kidco autoclose configure gate and they are not compatible. I guess they must have changed the joins on the newer model of the gate (G3000) (see pictures)"
2,wrong gate,"The description says it is for the G80, and that is what I needed. Even the picture is of the correct one. However, they sent me an extension for the G4300 series. They are not compatable with each other. Can we say ""False Advertisement"". Yet, Amazon allows for easy return and refund."
3,Too pricey for bunch of steel tubes welded together & painted,"Good durability. Has lasted my for years. My review is after years of use. Too pricey for a bunch of steel tubes wleded togther and painted. Just goes to show like the other Kidco product I bought, at the right time even the flimsiest of marketing info makes you let go of your senses (good luck controlling that of yours and your spouses at the same time) due to the hormones coursing thru your blood stream. If you are buying this at the time your kid is baby, try to evaluate ""true"" value gained and compare. (Agian good luck with that) The bay doesnot care how the product looks any ways and think of it as hindrance it has chew thru and pull at as you see."
5,Great Gate,"We got this gate for our two staircase's, which are side by side. This is the only gate I found that can be used for our situation. Our stairs didn't have the full wall on both sides, so it was a struggle to find any gates that worked.We had to get 2 extensions, but this has worked out really well for us and I think it is totally worth the price. We have had it installed for two months now and love it. It wraps around both of our staircases and is very easy to get in and out of using the door."
4,A sample of the best!,"In my opinion, ""Wendy Mcdonald"" is not about ""a weird psuedo-criticism of Fast Food joints"" as noted below. Instead through watching the video, I believe the lyrics are about wanting to be rid of pain from a bad relationship and the thing that brought him out of his depression was going to McDonalds and remembering when he was younger free of the pain that he was feeling right then. Maybe it was a purple Grimace toy that triggered it. It would for me.Anyways in regards to the EP, it has their best songs from ""Modes of Transportation"" which as full-length in my opinion is weak. The live feel also notes that they seem to have been a popular band in Japan which is kind of neat(even though it is a small venue). The production is surprisingly clear and the effects in the live version of ""Crystal Cradle"" are great with earphones. Recommended."
5,"Comprehensive, useful, thoughtful","Many books look useful but then when you really need guidance they fall apart. This book not only looks useful, it IS a useful guide to know what to do, when, and how. In fact, I found that it was the most useful book in qualitative research available on the market. It's a bit pricy but it's worth it."
1,Medical Anthropolgy and African Americans,"This is one of the worst text books I have ever attempted to read. The multiple studies are based on essentially quantitative research and are extremely poor examples. Broad based conclusions are based on small samples, 25 to 38,studing multiple independent variables. Very judgimental conclusions about African-Americans are based on these small samples. One of my own research projects on post renal transplant compliance had a sample of 1500 from 55 centers and at this sample size major changes occurred. Gender and ethnicity (racial group) fell out. People became people and all did basically the same health behaviors. I would recommend this book to no one. Bonnie Siegal, PhD--Social Science Reseacher with 30 years experience in health care"
2,Comida Buena Set of 4 Ceramic Oval Plates,"The four colors pictured are not what we recieved. Disappointed with this facet. One of the plates had a chip off the edge. Again not too satisified. Shipping seemed to take forever, but who can fault our wonderful postal service or UPS. They are never to blame."
1,Worst transfers ever for these classic noirs!,"Don't let the discounted price and the Sony label fool you.The transfers of these classics are no masters at all & look like s**t plain and simple.Speckles and jumping images abound throughout all the 5 movies.Worst of all,""I mobster"",originally in Cinemascope,is reformated in full screen and ""Raw deal"" is running at wrong speed.Avoid at all costs.The five titles,available as singles,are:I,mobster-Raw deal-T-Men-Let'em have it-Pretty boy Floyd-"
5,"Basil Holowach Sparta,NJ",Excellent Faucet Easy to install Looks Great Flawless Operation Received on time as specified. Recommend this faucet to others
2,Poorly Written,"Another reviewer said it's ""hard to follow"" and I agree. This is the book's biggest downfall. It's a shame too because the author seems pretty knowledgeable, but is decidedly a bad writer and communicator. This is one you might want to have around for reference. It has a lot of pictures and illustrations and the size is comfortable. I found a hardcover edition at my local library and it seems to have the same ISBN as the softcover listed here at Amazon."
4,indispensable for core battery test practice.,The audio cassette was vital in getting me accustomed to actual testing conditions. The sample questions accompanied by a real answer sheet made it possible for me to take a practice test that made the real thing much easier. The book proved instrumental to my success because I was able to get familiar with the format and structure of the exam.
5,So true to gay life,"This movie has it all from gay life. The ups and downs and the reality of friends and lovers. A timeless movie, with great old disco music. I think every gay person should watch this movie, it made me feel good."
4,what's so bad about feeling good?,"I totally enjoyed this film. After seeing so many dreary and depressing films with gay characters or dreary and depressing films about New York City, BROADWAY DAMAGE is a refreshing change-of-pace! The performances are all outstanding, especially Michael Shawn Lucas. This film has comedy, drama, romance, friendship. It's simply a great ""feel good"" film...and what's wrong with that?"
3,Not too heavy and a good bit of romance,"Broadway Damage was a fun and enjoyable film. It was not too heavy and not overly light, a good date movie. Not a lot of sexual stuff and no nudity. The acting was good and the story was cute. I would not put it on my top ten list but it is better than a great many of the indipendant gay themed films I have seen. I would say it is a good addition to the gay themed movie collection and a good investment. The best romantic comady todate is ""Trick"" with a simular story but done very well. This film is good for mixed groups and remains fairly nondiscript."
4,One of my favorites,This is a very cute movie... with one of those endings that makes you smile and hug your sweety. =)
2,Better than some . . . definately lite.,"I expected trash, and was a little surprised. The female lead (who you will recognize as young Christina Crawford in Mommy Dearest) was a mundane bore and then suddenly got in some great acting way too late in the film. This film was quite true to the Manhattan living situation, which most films ridiculously gloss over. It is trying to do something fresh with gay male romance, but the story wasn't strong or well-paced enough to have washed anywhere but our gay ""We'll watch anyone who is cute and takes off their shirt enough."" Not at all sophisticated but it did create a very authentic New York feeling. A Surprise, but then my expectations were low."
3,"A cute story, if somewhat erratic.","The film seems to wander and is a bit overly dramatic, but finishes well. If you are looking for a good gay comedy, I would rather watch Trick or Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss."
3,Decent,"A Movie about a Good looking gay man, who keeps chasing other good looking gay guys, his mousey side kick who has a crush on him and their loud, outrageous emotionally unstable ""Dare I say Fag Hag"" friend who stalks Magazine Editor Tina Brown in disturbing ways and who wears designer outfits of several thousand dollars to go apartment hunting. My How wacky and unique this is! Seriously I didn't hate the movie but was a bit dissappointed, it hit all it's marks but never really developed any depth. I do not want to give away the ending but I will say it left you feeling good. and one more thing, as a bonus, you get to see what the little girl who played the young daughter in Mommie Dearest turned out like."
2,Broadway Damaged,"It's always disappointing to see a good child actor turned bad. Mara Hobel (the young Christina in ""Mommy Dearest"") was terrific as a child but lost whatever acting talent to which she might once have laid claim. The movie is passable as entertainment but not as a comedy. The love story part of the movie seemed rather contrived and very predictable. I really wanted to like it but alas, it was only so-so."
1,I hated this film.,"I really wanted to like this film, as I love gay cinema. But the bad acting, horrible script and horrific directing made me hate it. And LONG! It's bad enough when a movie ""seems"" to drag on because it's so bad. Well, this movie is worse as it is BAD and clocks in at just under 2 hours. This film makes ""The Titanic"" seem like a short. This could have been such a great little film too. But it is just too tedious and too poorly executed to qualify for even a movie to fall asleep to. ""Attack of the killer tomatoes"" seems like an oscar winner compared to this stinker.If you want to see a great gay themed movie, skip this trash and go rent ""Edge of seventeen"" or ""Trick.""I am not kidding, this film is alful."
5,BUY THIS NOW!!!,"This CD is amazing. I love Nicky and Equipto, but Mike Marshall and Equipto are almost just as good together! The first 8 songs are amazing, and Nicky does have one sweet song, but its only 41 secs. Just buy this now!!!"
1,The latches and the straps that hold this up BROKE!,I got this for my new car so my Boston Terrier's hair wouldn't be everywhere in the backseat. It was great for a few weeks and then the latches and straps that held it up came apart. Now I use it for a trunk liner.
3,Its okay.....,"out of all of my alarm clocks that i have had, its just okay. it wakes me up when it has to, most of the time. i have found that i have been late to work several times because it just doesnt want me to wake up sometimes. other than that the fetures are pretty good, the cd player part works very good. and im not sure who said it, but it does have a batery backup, or at least mine does, cause i never have to reset it when the power goes out."
4,Good Night's Sleep,"I love this clock radio/CD player! It's a great clock radio for someone who's trying to get back to better sleeping habits. I was originally looking for a clock radio with soothing ""nature sounds"" built in, but this clock radio really does the job. I can play a CD with nature sounds or soothing music when I go to bed. I just set a timer, and the CD turns itself off. I can set the alarm to wake up to music, the radio, or a buzzer. By the way, the buzzer isn't an obnoxious loud buzz; it's more like a pulsing chirp. Much more pleasant to wake up to! The LCD has two brightness settings, so the light doesn't wake me up in the middle of the night. The only down side is that it takes up a little more room on the bedside table than I had planned, but that's minor compared to this clock radio's strengths."
4,Would be a Great Clock radio except for?,"I Had this radio for a few days, but had to return it. 1. No back-up battery and 2. the dots between the hour and minutes constantly blink, there is no way of stoping it. Sounds crazy, but it drove me nuts. Other then these two exceptions the radio play well."
2,CD player not of high quality,"This worked great up until a little less than a year after purchase, then the CD player started going haywire. It still plays CD's, yet when I set the alarm to play a song on the CD, it will spin and spin, but not play. Tried to get it replaced under warranty so I called Sony helpline and they talked me through it until it eventually worked on one song on a different CD, of course when I hung up, it stopped working again. Not worth the $50 I spent."
1,Don't recommend this,"There's no battery back up and the radio needs to be tuned manually. I wanted the radio to wake me and set it for the radio, but the alarm beeped. I reset it and tried the following morning using the second alarm, and it also only beeped. I want to wake gradually to a radio, not a beeping. I do not recommend this item."
4,"Good for the Price, Plays CD-R well.","I bought and returned three clock radios in this price range from other companies because they did not play my audio books and CD-R music well. This device does play these well and I am keeping this one.The only problem is lack of batery back-up, it does have some kind of internal memory but I am not sure how long it can last in a power outage or if the alarm will still go off, I could not find this information in the enclosed instructions."
3,Trigger Happy,"In general it was a real weird movie... sometimes hard to follow, if you miss something in it... confusing the first time viewed. But what I loved most about it was the brief part that Billy Idol played in it as ""Lee Turner""!!"
1,Don't walk... RUN away from this movie.,"Without a doubt, one of the worst films I've ever seen. Horribly bland script. No interesting plot twists. Incredibly stiff acting.If you are highly entertained by seeing lots of A- and B-list actors walk around reading insipid lines and shooting each other, then this might be for you. But I doubt it.Roger Ebert (who can hardly be considered a harsh critic) gave this film ZERO stars.Horrible. Horrible. Horrible."
2,to Brewsley,"You may not be a fan of Christopher Jones as I am but you have no right to ""dog him"" like that. You have got to realize all actors have good parts and bad parts in movies. This just wasn't the right part for him. Check him out in his earlier movies and you will see what I am talking about. Otherwise, leave the comments to somebody who knows what they are talking about. catfeb02"
5,great low-key comedy,"movies like this are really hard to describe.people get 'rubbed out"" and you love it. two ofmy favorite actors-gabriel byrne and jeff goldblum-do a geat job but the kudos have to go to thewriter and director of the film-larry bishop-whoalso does a great job as a laconic hitman."
3,Mad movie,"If you watch this film expecting to see a kind of remake of the Godfather or Donnie Brasco, forget about it... but if you want a second degree con film this is it!! most of the actors are hilarious and pretending to be somebody else, like a real godfather, you never believe in them for 1 second and you can see how much they enjoy overplaying..."
4,Gangsters make the world go Around.,"MDT is a gem. Bizarre and very funny. If you like any of the actors in this film, and you have a taste for the bizarre and dark humor, chances are you'll find a lot to love here. Dreyfuss, Goldblum, MacLachlan, Reynolds, Silva, Byrne are all great. Be the first in your mob to discover this."
5,"Sit, Walk, Stand","Other than the Bible, this fantastic and short book by Watchman Nee has been the most influential piece of literature I have ever read. It changed my life - it could change yours, too."
5,Excellent and very revealing view of Ephesians,I really enjoy this book. It's coverage of Ephesians was indepth and very revealing. I will re-read this book many more times.
1,wanted to like it but couldn't.,"I have heard of Watchman Nee and was eager to read some of his books. however, I just couldn't get into his style of writing, probably due to the era he is from, it wasn't easy for me to connect with."
5,Deceptively Simple; Unbelievably Profound,"A hidden gem. Within fewer than 80 pages, Nee lays out in simple terms some of the most profound truths of the Christian life from the book of Ephesians. It will inspire and challenge both new and mature believer alike."
3,Missing a key concept,"Unfortunately, in my opinion the author is a bit ahead of reality in his 3-step concept. Before, most of us can accomplish the first step of ""Sit"", as he discusses it, we must first spend significant time seeking the truth in knowledge and wisdom, both spiritual and human. Otherwise, we would be in danger of becoming another idiot utterly convinced of their worldview when it is built on the Food Network, attending Church on holidays, and the Twilight series as literature. If I am already a well-read, learned and pious person, then this book is useful. If I am the average person, it offers me a construction project that is missing most of the building materials."
2,Oneida flatware set,"Really glad this was on super discount. Not the quality that I would have imagined from Oneida. First, the forks all have a different slant - they do not 'spoon' together. My husband had to use a metal working tool to give them the same pitch, for lack of a better word. Second, the set isn't balanced well, they feel awkward in your hand. I knew this could be a problem with buying without actually holding them first.I have learned my lesson on buying flatware on-line."
3,Pleased for Price,"It is a nice set for the price you get it at Amazon. Two issues: 1) Each piece has a slightly different cast to it, making it impossible for them to lay flat in a drawer. 2) It says dishwasher safe, but after only a few runs through the washer they developed rust spots! Was looking for a set a little more low maintenance than this. Overall, price is good for set, but expected better quality from Oneida."
2,Quality not up to par,"1.Oneida Demeter 45-Piece Stainless Steel Flatware Set, Service for 82. For 18/10 stainless flatware, I expected no flaws, but have found several pieces (after runing through dish washer) that had what appears to be rust spots.3. The handle edges of the all the utensils are sharp.4. The forks and spoons do not nest (spoon) together at all.5. The elder person in the family has a hard time using the utensils do to the design of the handles."
3,moderately pleased,"they are interesting and modern looking although it bit bottom heavy, making them awkward to hold or balance on things. something that i really didn't like on this is that every piece is engraved with ""made in china"" on the back....which...i do not enjoy. the deal is pretty standard, i saw a similar set ..in brand and model at Tuesday Morning for the same price. $60 is a pretty good price although not the ""steal"" it is made out to be."
3,Oneida Demeter 45-Piece Stainless Steel Flatware Set,"I like the weight of this flatware however, it's a little too ""dainty"". Not for anyone with big hands. It is nice looking though."
5,Wall Murals,"These dolphin wall murals are an excellent addition to my sons bathroom. So easy to put up and you can arrange them to your own liking. Better than pictures that make holes in the wall, have a tendency to fall and need cleaning. If I ever change the motif in our bathrooms I will definetly look for matching Wallpaper Wall murals again."
3,I use this faithfully,I use arnicare faithfully for bruising but I am not sure whether or not it actually works. I think it helps my bruising heal a little faster or I would stop using it.
4,Arnica Really Works,My wife has been a big believer in Arnica gel for years. She first encountered it when we lived in Europe in the 80's. I scoffed when she said it would prevent bruising and swelling from sprains. Now I've tried it and it seems to really work.
5,daily helper,"ever since I know and use this product I am winning more and more people over to use it, too...says enough? Well, fact is that for any muscle or joint pains (pulled, strained or similar) I apply it 3 times a day ..10-15 minutes after applying it, the pain is dramatically reduced if not gone ...yes, the pain will usually come back throughout the day - though much less pronounced - as Arnica gel is mainly a pain reliever but applying it for 3-5 days it is gone for good (seems to me that Arnica GEL helps healing quicker) - until I pull a muscle again ( being very active with young kids and at the gym ) .. NOTE that I am reviewing the Arnica GEL here..I had tried BOIRON Arnica CREAM, too but that didn't have the same good effects ( Gel is better and faster absorbed )"
2,bad packing,"I'm very disappointed for this buy, the packing wasn't the proper and 1 of the 3 bottles arrived broken, and the capsules were all over the box with pieces of glass."
5,"Conway Twitty, 25 Number Ones","Music preview helped sell the product, fast delivery.Great doing business A++"
4,The Opera that Made Corelli a Star,"There are two versions of the Bel Canto Society video. One is letterboxed with no subtitles. The picture quality is not good, but the sound is wonderful. The other version was made for TV and has English narration throughout the video. On this tape the sound and picuture are excellent considering the age of the performance. Corelli is absolutely gorgeous as is the actress playing Tosca. Tosca's voice is Maria Caniglia - fabulous!!! Bel Canto Society has provided Tosca/Corelli fans with a marvelous gift in these tapes. There is nothing like them today and until Corelli is reborn, there never will be."
3,Great Talent but bad focus.,"A great singer Corelli is fabulous in this video with great sound however picture quality is not good at all,contiually going in and out of focus."
3,More Please...,"Historical Setting is a good little book for those interested in turn of the century history of economic thought, or with Austrian Economics in general. Mises was in an ideal position to write a history of Austrian economics because he was old enough to be heavily involved with prewar Austrian economics, but young enough to be in the middle of interwar and postwar Austrian economics. Unfortunately, Mises wrote mainly about prewar AE in this volume. My own interest is in the Interwar and Postwar years, so I would have benefited from an extension of this work into at least the mid twentieth century. That being said Historical Setting is still a worthwhile read."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Big Def Leppard fan, not a big Taylor Swift fan, but it was very enjoyable and interesting, especially the interviews and bonus features."
5,Can't Stop Watching This DVD,"Wow - simply awesome. Bought this for my husband, who is a HUGE Def Leppard fan, and has all of their DVD's in his collection. Neither of us were Taylor Swift fans, but as other reviews have stated, this DVD is a wonderful collaboration between the two, and somehow brought out the best in both bands, creating an amazing performance. It is clearly evident that everyone is having a great time performing, including the audience, who were probably largely Swift fans, and it's hard not to get into this concert along with them. We've had this DVD playing for two days straight and can't get enough of it. Would have loved to have seen this performance live. Fabulous, just fabulous."
1,Garbage,Def Leppard used to be an awesome band but why they are releasing poop music these days and dueting with Taylor Swift is beyond me....I guess money means more to them than pure music or their legacy.
3,Not Very Informative or Complete,"I recently ordered this book, as I don't know too much about Techno music and I remember the Rough Guide to Rock that was once online (but has since disappeared) being fairly informative and well-written. However, I realized after getting this book that the Rough Guide online seemed good precisely b/c it was online, and free. At least when it comes to music (I've not read any of their travel books), the rough guides are not very thorough or involved in the subject matter. You could probably get all the information in this book free online from the All Music Guide. And also don't expect to get complete discography information. You just get one or a few recommendations for each artist and sketchy details in the entry about their recorded output. It is generally well-written though."
1,"If You're Gonna Rob Me, At Least Wear A Mask...","No one, I mean no one, takes advantage of the audience that keeps them in business the way MYA does. Apart from a precious few releases over the last two years, almost EVERY flick they release is sourced from the WORST possible print - it's like this was their goal, to victimize their core audience and laugh all the way to the bank. There's no point in even reviewing the film (though some do have their Eurosleaze moments, as does this one, most are horrid movies as well, promoted with covers to make them appear alluring to this audience - us poor saps) as the poor picture quality, glitches, and blemishes are non-stop and preclude any type of appreciation of the flick. We need to cease turning over our hard-earned cash to these bastards until they start respecting those who pay their bills. BOYCOTT MYA COMMUNICATIONS !!!"
4,Great tasting,"If you like coffee but watch your caffiene intake pick some of this up. Tastes great, could be priced more aggresively. The taste is full and rich with no bitterness."
1,Disappointed - Is this normal?,"I've been enjoying Illy medium roast at home but was looking to cut back on the caffeine. I ordered the decaf, but it's really bitter. I've made it a couple of times now, and it's always the same result. I'm using the same process as with the non-decaf - which comes out beautifully each time. If anyone has ideas, or can tell me I just got a bad batch (which, at this price is frustrating), that would help. I would really like to incorporate some decaf into my espresso drinking, especially in the evening."
3,WAS state of the art in 2005,"I had this computer for over 4 years now, the longest time I have owned a PC. It was a medium priced PC back in 2005. Time for an upgrade in 2009. My next PC will have Windows 7 OS, more RAM and a bigger hard drive and a better graphics card.Its a good PC for a youngster or someone who is buying lowbuck. Don't get me wrong- its a pretty fast computer, I have not had any problems with it. Good enough for the internet and basic gaming. But with Windows7 coming out soon- its time to upgrade from Windows XP."
4,"Nice, light, small dictionary","I've vowed to improve my neglected vocabulary by reading more literature and looking up any words I don't know. I was originally using a hardcover college dictionary, but I found its size and weight to be cumbersome. I bought this dictionary because I didn't like lugging around the heavy hardcover to and from my easy chair and found it to be a suitable replacement. Rarely can I not find a word in the dictionary that would appear in the college dictionary and it serves my purpose well. It's about the size of a large paperback novel (smaller than War and Peace). The only problem is mine doesn't have the pronunciation key ""located on inside of back cover."""
4,Another great cd !,"I've had this cd for a few days now and after a few listens the songs are really starting to sink in.It means absolutely nothing that the lyrics are in Swedish.As the last reviewer said,don't let this stop you from getting this cd.So far i still like ""Vapen & Ammunition"" better,but time will tell.LP"
2,Ok for the price,Fit pretty well but The quality is poor. Hard to use a side view mirro when the objects are all wavy.
2,Book makes several errors via poor proofing,"The book is sound in principle, but from the start there are lots of errors in diagrams, formulas, and descriptions. They appear to be the result of poor proofing. EG. A diagram should have the Voltages provided, but they are not, A value should read 117*I (where I is current) but instead reads 1171, a problem worked through specifies how to arrive at Power, but writes ""Volts"" after the value instead of watts.It had the potential to be a great book, but the time I've spent trying to figure out the mistakes make it a trash can candidate after 3 chapters. I'll have to look for a different book on the same subject."
3,"High marks on content, low score on editing","Intuitive and practical, this is a pretty decent introduction to electronics. It covers the most pertinent subjects, but fails to follow through with proper editing. Some references are made in error. Page 84, for instance, references drawing 42 where 41 should have been referenced. In any case, the content is good and should be considered on its merits: practicality and intuitive examples."
5,Classic Camp,"This is a classic Camp album. Songs written by Camp and Rob Frazier. This album is heavily influenced by the book ""Bad News For Modern Man"" as Franky Schaeffer.Standout tracks are ""Even Now"", ""Stranger to Holiness"", and ""On the Edge""Released in 1985 and a tour featuring Rob Frazier on guitar/keys and Rick Cua on bass this makes a great classic christian 80's pop recording."
2,From a big Christmas fan,"This DVD was okay, but not what I had hoped. There are 5 shows: Jack Benny's Christmas, Jack Benny's New Year (rather droll), Ozzie and Harriet's Christmases, and Beverly Hillbillies Christmas. The best episode in my opinion was of Ozzie and Harriet with Ozzie being too busy at Christmas. Very funny. I have that on VHS and liked it so much I bought this DVD when I found out it was on it. Otherwise, the sound quality on the Jack Benny episodes is very poor. I found myself turning the tv up and down with each episode. The Beverly Hillbillies episode was ""same old theme"", different day. I guess it's not bad for the price."
2,1954 shows with 1939 picture quality,"Having seen the excellent picture quality of the Jack Benny Shows when they went to film in the mid fifties (there were 104 0f them), what a pity that these shows are taken from the kinescope versions - or are they kinescopes of the film versions, its hard to tell. Jack Benny is great in the two programmes featured, but in 2002, shouldn't we get better picture and sound quality. Worth having, but a big disappointment.>"
5,reall good,flame proof used it on my cuddy cabin and on several pontoons to re line the fuel system because of bad lines
3,an amusing book,"A nice collection of nursery rhymes, both common and obscure. Since the main point of the book is the accompanying drawings that illustrate the nursery rhymes for young children, it's odd that so many of the drawings are ""inaccurate"". ""My little black hen"" is yellow. ""Baa, baa, black sheep"" is white. ""The little boy laughed"" is actually a dog. ""The cow's in the meadow"" is actually in the barn. It's like they didn't get the illustrator a copy of the rhymes."
1,How could 3 people give this a 5?,"How could 3 people give this a 5 star rating? Terrible acting, terrible video camera, and yes they used a low quality video camera. terrible sound. I wanted my money back after the first 3 minuets. If anyone decides to watch this after reading my review please send me $3.00 since you like throwing your money away."
5,class text book,"the books was fine, just as described. was used for communications course at a community college; this was the required text on syllabus."
3,Author not sympathetic to hard money,"Remini comes to the conclusion that the Bank was not all bad, it was simply a political struggle between Jackson and Biddle. I don't agree. It's a good detailed acount of the events, and I'd recommend it for such, but if you're a supporter of hard money (the Jackson position) you may consider looking elsewhere or complementing this reading. I'd recommend Murray Rothbard. He addresses some of the authors (mis)information on hard money in ""A History of Money and Banking in the US.""It's great to read a book about the President actually checking the power of the Congress and Court in a struggle over what's authorized in the Constitution. A President disagrees with a Supreme Court ruling, and actually challenges it. Not something that happens anymore, and that's unfortunate."
3,Review,"Remini's book, Andrew Jackson and the Bank War, is a very good book in the way of information. Although it is not a ""page turner,"" it satisfies in giving the information. I would not have purchased this book except it is needed for my American History course."
3,Book club selection - not my cup of tea,I am still struggling with this book. Only about 5 chapters in and not finding enjoyment. I promised a friend I would finish the book so we shall see.
3,We Tht Living Amazon,"This was new 60th anniversary hardback. Page xiv Introduction, notes 1-7 none of these interesting items were present in the book. There was no chapter index.Rex Valentine"
3,Rand's Warm Up,"I admit I read Atlas Shrugged years before reading We the Living even they were written in the opposite order. I recommend reading WTL first as Atlas Shrugged is far superior. They are similar in that both feature a heroine involved with two heroes, eventually choosing one in the end.Rand is not shy in promoting her objectivism of the self. She presents her philosophy masterfully in rich narration and thoughtful dialog.I found myself bored in the first half of the book. The second half read faster. I did not quickly connect emotionally with the characters; I kept reading because I enjoyed Atlas Shrugged so much.I did learn about life inside the U.S.S.R. and the dirty politics therein. I wonder if Rand was as familiar with similar dirty politics in democracy and capitalism."
4,thought-provoking and a real eye opener,Have read this three or four times and have never tired. 'Twas a real eye-opener to this native-born American who grew up in a shelterd home in the 40's and 50's. This should be required reading in our high schools. Reads easier than Atlas or Fountainhead.
3,Shades of Gray,"This book is billed as a great philosophical tour de force, a marketing strategy clearly meant to appeal to Atlas Shrugged readers who may have missed her first work. Instead, most of the time it reads like a conventional love story, with many more shades of gray than one will find in her all-or-nothing works like Atlas. This disappointed me."
4,A good book for insight to Rand or communist Russia.,"This book is interesting in light of Rand's other writings and to illuminate her historical perspective. She said herself that this book was as close to an auotbiography as she would get, an autobiography in emotion and philosophy not in exact circumstances. Rand grew up in communist Russia, and the world that she creates for you in this book is as vivid and painful as it must have been for her. The plot can be slow in spots, and you may find yourslef wanting to scream at her main character at times. All in all this is a valuable reading experience if you are looking for more insight to Rand, or communist Russia, or just another good book from this masterful writer"
3,Get ready for a hard dose of reality. Not an easy read.,"This was a very dark book. We chose it for our bookclub reading for Jan. It was a very good discussion book, however pretty depressing. Too much reality as it is very similiar to what is happening in our country right now."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I am seventeen and I have never read a book like this one . I was profoundly affected and I believe anyone who reads this book will be , too . Kira is an unbelievable character . Her story is poignant and real . The book is real . There are no mushy fake scenes of perfect love or happy endings . Life isn't that way and niether is this book."
5,Worth every page...,"I finished reading this book two nights ago, and still it feels like a gaping hole has been torn into my soul. Rand's writing is so powerful, I feel I must recover from this book as if it were me that lived the events she described.Read this book, not for likable characters or a feel-good ending - but for the way Rand will move you both emotionally and intellectually as you try to reconcile the events and characters of this book."
2,My Opinion,"First, I did not like the book. It was like a trashy romance novel. It offered little information on the actual Russian Revolution. The book is about a girl named Kira who sleeps around too much to survive. She claims that she is in love, but she doesn't even know the meaning of the word. I do, however, like the end. I believe that Communism does forbid life to the living. If any part of this story is read, read the end. Kira and Andrei's last speeches almost make reading the book worth while. People who want a spin on a serious topic should read this book."
1,I got mine you better get urs.,"same as before, the mentality of the haves against the have nots. Not a nice person, self-centerednessas an art form."
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Atlas Shrugged, and I also enjoyed Fountainhead. As I had heard We The Living was a quasi autobiography of Ayn Rand's life in the Soviet Union, my expectations were very high. However, although the depictions of life under communism and the Soviet Union were extremely important and revealing, the storyline and plot itself were very dull. Maybe that was the point--the banality and dullness of life under communism aside from all the brutality and meanness. Regardless, the story was not interesting and the characters were not interesting; it turned into a bizarre, trashy romance novel. In no way did this book come close to Atlas Shrugged or Fountainhead. Sadly, I gave it up at about half-way. Others may have gotten more out of this book, but I did not. If you want to read Ayn Rand, go with Atlas Shrugged--it is tremendous."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"This book might reward a long attention span but dull is really all I can say about it. The writing is typically cryptic, leaving it up to the reader to fill in the blanks, but generic banal detail fills up most of the space on the pages.The characters lifestyles are inactive, the environment never changes, and the relationships between the characters never get very complex although the relative lack of detail about the characters natures and motives always seems to want to keep you guessing. With every character in the book I was consistently thinking maybe there's more to them but there never was. Edited down to a quarter of it's length this book could have been a more engaging narrative and still maintained the value in it's depictions of everyday living in oppressive USSR society, but even then Kira's tragic romances, which were romantic for about ten seconds before they lost their lustre, would still seem pointless."
2,Doesn't Compare,"This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead. In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written. If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.I could not finish We the Living. I got sick of the stupid relationship. I guess I got about 1/4th the way through. Maybe my tastes are changing."
2,very dissapointing,this book as many have said is one of the worst books to ever be thought up as ayn rand was a terrible philosepher this book is a terrible read
3,Not a bad book...but not a great story.,"If you want to know what life was like in communist Russia in the 20's, this is a great read. If you're interested learning why communism failed and why America is headed in a terrifying direction today, read this.If you're interested in Rand's philosophy on capitalism and a better story line, try Atlas Shrugged instead. Personally, I would skip this for either Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead."
3,dreary,"If you're like me, you devoured Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead. I went into reading We The Living with the same expectations only to find the characters not nearly as intriguing and the plot plodding. The last fifty pages or so were fantastic but this reader is unsure whether it's worth the journey to get there."
2,The most readable of Rand's books,"For those of you who excroriate Rand for one-sided hatred of Communism, let me just point out that she was born under it, and she ought to know. The first hundred pages of this book are the best thing Rand ever wrote --complicated characters, and a vivid, chilling depiction of life under the Bolsheviks. Of course, then Rand the proselytizer elbows her way in, and it's downhill from there. One can forgive Rand for hating Communism, but to go a mile in the opposite direction and espouse such a brutal solipsism is perhaps a sign of some psychological problems on her part. What would the world be like if everyone were to declare himself a monomaniacal Dr. Doom surrounded by foolish mortals? Brilliant she may have been, but, unfortunately, also totally nuts."
5,?,"Ayn Rand created a beautiful expression here. Personally, I've never known her better, than at 2:00 AM last evening when I finshed this work. I've been a big fan of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, admittedly full of obvious characters and grueling tirades. Subtlety is not always the benchmark by which I judge a book. So for that difference, I've loved these books, where many experienced readers have felt a nauseating boredom. ""We the living"" is just a fantastic expression of a talented and driven young woman (Ayn Rand). I think the average reader will really enjoy it."
5,"A ""must read"" for all who are concerned about the ideologies of today","Ayn Rand warns, in riveting fiction, of the fate that awaits those who succumb to the false promises of socialism. Unless you're asleep, it's hard to miss the similarity of language that steers the revolutionaries of early 20th century Russia and that of the current US administration. I couldn't put the book down."
5,We The Living Review,"We The Living was not the first Ayn Ran book I read, and it would be difficult to say which is the best, but We the Living is a window to the life and thinking of Ayn Rand. Her characters are real people, ones I would have liked to know. Kira is the embodiment of a lover of life, no matter what the odds were against her living it. Rand used her characters to show the brutality of any dictatorship and her words are, sadly, still true today. Rand's writing style is superb and I recommend this book to anyone who believes their life is worth something to themselves and is not to be lived for the sake of others."
1,I agree with Kyle,"I agree with Kyle. This book is boring, dull, and uninteresting. This book reads like a history textbook, only with less information. I can't believe that such a book would be allowed to be published. There are two elements of this book: slight hunger and sex. The sex is even dull and uninteresting."
4,A book giving perspective,"Written in 1993, this book is still worth of reading today. Actually, it is more interesting to read today because some of the uncertainties in Russia back then had worked themselves out. The book was well structured and followed clear themes. The scenarios were plausible. I especially enjoyed the chapter on Russian transition from a market economy to a market one."
4,As good as the others she has written...,"...which says a lot. Llywelyn writes incredible novels, and this one is definitly up to par. My favorite is still Druids, but this one, a saga of the coming of the Milesians to Ireland, is a fascinating and fun read as well. Well worth it."
2,Just not as good as many of her other works.,"Ms. Llywelyn's outstanding prose just isn't able to pull this book out of the doldrums. Not nearly the equal of her many other books. I found myself skipping pages in an effort to get through this book. With the exception of Amergin, the characters are flat and not particularly memorable. Could have done better."
1,Feminine fantasies,"I am very interested in Irish culture and mythology, but this book was way too feminine for me to be able to wade thru. Most (95%) of the text is long, boring descriptions of the various character's emotional states; the ""action"" such as it is, is just silly. For example, the hero's brother has gone berserk, and is about to kill an important guest, when he is stopped in mid-sword-stroke by the beauty of the song that the Bard starts to sing. Yeah, right. If you are a fan of bodice-ripper type historical romances, then you will like this book; otherwise forget it."
1,TEDIOUS READING,"The book started off well but eventually became a boring account of a subject that could have been much more interesting. The author gives depth only to Amergin and makes the remaining characters a group of silly, strange people. The women are only sex objects and there is not one female character in the book of any importance. I found myself skipping pages just so I could finally get through this boring work."
3,Ending almost spoils the voyage.,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, the ending is a problem. While the characters are symbolic more than fully developed, they are a serviceable means of telling the story of one possible way the Gaels settled in Ireland. The history seems plausible and the daily life of this tribe comes across as very true. But after creating an atmosphere that seems to be based strongly on available research, Llywelyn introduces the ""little people"" and things rapidly go downhill. With cryptic mentions of powerful weapons that were ""earthkillers"" and the disappearence of the Tuatha De Danann, the book enters the realm of fantasy. Not a problem if it started that way, but quite a shock to this reader after following a journey that seemed very true up until this point. If you can make the leap the author requires of the reader, this book is an interesting look at the history of the Irish."
5,Outstanding,I picked this book up at a yard sale because it caught my eye. I am of Scot/Irish heritage. Finding books that are historically accurate and well written concerning that history are hard to come across. Llywelyn delivers on both counts. I had been looking for a good author to add to my library and what I wonderful discovery I made by reading Bard. I have since ordered almost all her other books. I recommend starting with this one. She references the information in Bard in most of the other books I have read thus far. If you like history and a well crafted story then this a feast. I highly recommend it as well as Llywelyn's other offerings.
4,Great release from on of the Connells songwriters,"George Huntley's solo release, Brain Junk, is a wonderful solo outing. Featuring his trademark jangly guitar work, this release pulls the listener in deeper with each listen. If you are a fan of the Connells, you will instantly recognize George's sound from the band's releases. This cd features some stripped down numbers as well as some which could come right from a Connells release, though this releasegives George an opportunity to explore some different territories at times sounding folky, country but all the time catchy. Peele Wimberley from the Connells assists on drums throughout."
2,Not what I had hoped for,I was reading notes on Pandora about the Connells and saw that there was a solo CD by George Huntley so I bought it. If I had been paying attention I would have noticed that all ( or at least most ) the songs were written by one of the Connells not the vocalist Huntely. So it wasn't a solo Connells CD and was weak compared to the group work.
4,crazy,We used this map in Portugal but it is not like the US roads. They don't post numbers. You just watch the signs that say the town/city/place you want to go. But yes it was helpful. Crazy but an adventure.
4,good but could be even better,The title is right and the books gives you a lot of not very deep information. But good as kind of catalogue. Authors missed a lot of regions. They took only well known to westeners. Somw great monuments are missed as well. But in general I would recommend to buy it for people who are interested in architecture and/or Islamic culture. Good photos.
4,Cycle Shack Slip on's,"Ms- 129 Slash cuts will not fit 1994 FXDL without bracket BK9. They will fit 1995 and up using the stock bracket. These are deep sounding, heavy chrome mufflers at a real good price. Did not have to re-jet as of now. No pop back at all. Replaced the factory slip on's and they sound much better, like an HD should."
3,Not what I was looking for,"Working with You is Killing Me was a good book in that it showed me that I am not alone. I did identify a lot of the tough to deal with characters that were featured in this book-one of each of them is lurking around my life.That said, the advice given is common sense-there is nothing here that I haven't read anywhere before. But it sure did make me feel better knowing that other people are going through similar issues in their relationships with others.I can't really recommend this book unless you are looking for validation that you aren't nuts. That's all here. But the tips and tricks you are hoping for, well, you could get the same caliber stuff from the Sunday employment section of your local paper."
2,stunk,"The book smelled and looked like it came from someone's basement. The book itself was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Pop-Psychology,"This book was assigned reading for a ""Leadership"" in business class. The first two chapters set the tone for the rest of the book. Read those, and the rest will be just variations on the same theme. I now use the book as a doorstop."
2,Disappointed,"With all the glowing reviews, I thought this book would have something new and innovative, something I hadn't heard before. No such luck. Some interesting strategies and tactics for dealing with difficult people and see how you might be contributing to the problem, but nothing you won't find in other books on the subject.I eventually gave up before finishing the CD because of the lack of anything new and I got tired of listen to the authors :-("
3,5 lbs. in a 15 lbs. sack,"The information presented in this book is useful and logical. However, the book is incredibly padded with redundancies and hypothetical examples which only restate concepts easily understood on first reading. It would be a much better book if it were 80 pages long. But 200+ pages is too much! Some of the suggestions are downright silly: go get a massage if your boss mistreats you. Come to think of it, maybe you should save the cost of this book and put a down payment on a spa treatment."
4,bling bling!,"no matter what kind of musical space Conor Oberst reaches out to, he always manages to create a beautiful piece of art and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn is no exception. The layered arrangements from previous records are present and they mix well with Conor's style of electronic music. Also, the lyrical content is as good as ever. here, Conor addresses concepts of death and doing so he successfully sends meaningful melodic messages out through one's speakers. this album in one of Bright Eyes' best and a great sonic experiment. in retrospect, Digital Ash is the inferior record compared to companion piece I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning. Compared to other electronic releases such as the work of The Faint, Digital Ash is a good listen but is not going to make Conor the indie version of Richard D. James."
3,Eh....,"It's hard to give less than a stellar review to an artist whom everyone considers the new Bob Dylan, but...meh. Props for trying something new, but Postal Service did it better. Starts off pretty strong, but towards the middle the melodies are just lacking, and eventually you fall asleep. But that said... it's not a bad album, and at least I'm semi-qualified to review it, whereas the reviewer below me, ""sweety cheeks"" or whatever, does not deserve to have his opinion aired at all. And I'll tell you why:HE GAVE KORN 5 STARS.Seriously dude, how much of an idiotic hypocrite can you be? Everything you listed for emo (trying to get attention, pretending to be depressed, etc etc) is a million times truer for the white trash gene-pool scum with dreadlocks and extra wide pants. At least emo kids aren't trying to act tough or play the pathetic ""I'm so LOCO, don't F*** with me!"" card. I'm sorry you're mad that emo kids are encroaching on your favorite hangout spot at Hot Topic. Get a life."
2,"Oh, Conor!","Although a lot of people don't care for Conor Oberst personally, I think he's an amazing lyricist and have been following him in Omaha since the beginning. ""Digital Ash"" was such a disappointment! Not even this die-hard Bright Eyes fan was on board. I've given the album more than a fair chance, and although I like some of the lyrics, the music and arrangements are a far cry from anything Bright Eyes has done before and ends up sounding, as others have said, rather amateurish.Worse, though, was seeing these songs played in concert earlier this month. Oberst followed The Faint, which really rocked the crowd, and then songs from ""Digital Ash"" brought everyone down, causing many people to leave early. He only played one song not from the CD, and a lot of people were hoping to hear a few from ""I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning."" Given that the audience was mostly from his home town, the mass exodus served as a fair review. Buy another CD instead of this one--""Lifted"" if you don't have it."
2,"Unlucky Friend, Lucky Me","My roommate and I are Bright Eyes fans, not diehard, but quite fond of earlier CD's which we found to be lyrically great (Lifted of the story.., fevers and mirrors)...So when Bright Eyes was going to release 2 CDs at once, we were pretty enthralled. But being college students (and therefore slightly short of cash) I decided that I would buy ""I'm wide awake"" and he would buy ""Digital Ash""...Then we could listen to both.Well I am glad that luck was in my favor, because ""Digital ash"" is unlike bright eyes I have known. THey go for the Postal Service electronica style, but whereas ""Give Up"" is a pleasant if unexciting CD, it is more than listenable. To be harsh this CD is almost egregious to the point that it gets little to no playing time in our doorm.If you want to get into Bright Eyes though, get some of the earlier CDs. I loved ""Lifted"" and ""fevers"", and to a lesser extent ""Im wide awake"". Not digital ash."
3,Some welcomed new direction,"3 1/2 starsNew growth overshadows past revolving's as a more self indulgent vocalist, where the vocals are usually mixed in a much better way then with previous releases. I still feel that Conor Oberst can sing far more effectively then his settled range has characterized, but I am happy to see the new maturity with himself, and with the studio mastery entailed in making an electronic Bright Eyes album. While no revelation, these songs are highly entertaining and take Bright Eyes in some nice new directions they will hopefully incorporate in future releases, as their sound was begining to grow a bit tedious."
2,Ambitious at Best!,"This album severely lacks coherency, listenable melodies, hooks, flow and story. I am not a big Bright Eyes fan and I honestly think he's overrated, but that was after listening to this disappointing release. There are very few genius moments scattered throughout this album, but not enough to make it worth your while.If you are not familiar with Bright Eyes, try some of his other albums (I'm Wide Awake It's Morning is actually pretty good). This album is not a good introduction to his work to say the least. I guess it was meant for hardcore fans!I, for one, won't be buying any of his albums anytime soon."
4,It's still a good album,"I've been reading some reviews on this album with such quotes as ""distictly not bright eyes"" and that it's electro trash, but personally I think this is a great album. While it's true it doesn't sound like anything Oberst has done before, I think that's a good thing. The lyrics *are* distinctally Bright Eyes, with the exception of a few songs. I do like some of the older stuff better, like Fevers and Mirrors and Lifted, but this still a great addition to any collection."
5,Different Bright Eyes,"I listened to this album the day it came out and I thought it was well done. It certainly isn't like the other Bright Eyes albums, but it is good nonetheless."
3,Not their best album but still worhtwhile,This one is not as good as Cassadaga or the Story is in the Soil but it is still pretty good.
4,The first great CD of 2005,"First off, I have never listedned to a Bright Eyes cd before this one, so i don't know what he's ""supposed"" to sound like. But for my money this a phenomenal cd. I first got into Bright Eyes when amazon posted the free mp3s on the website. And I liked Take It Easy(Love Nothing) and Gold Mine Glutted are much better songs than the way too morose Lua. Overall every song is good in it's own way. The only complaint I have is that the first 2 minutes of Time Code is pretty much silence, which I have to skip through every time I listen to it. And on Ship In A Bottle, the part of the song where it breaks down into a baby crying annoys me. But other than that I have no complaints."
4,Dennis from South Jersey,"I've listened to this cd over and over and each time I listen I enjoy it even more. While certainly different from what we've come to expect from Conor, the music is captivating none the less. Because it was released separately from ""I'm wide awake, it's morning"", it's only natural to compare the two efforts. That's a real shame because both are really good Cds each with it's high points and good supply of quality music. If this cd and I'm wide awake..."" had been released as a double cd, everyone would be talking about how great the cd is and selecting the best songs...some electronic, some more typical of Bright Eyes past CDs and it would be included in almost everyone's ""best of"" list. So don't try to compare. Buy them both and enjoy each. You won't be sorry."
2,Digital Schmigital,"This collection has the taint of the throwaway about it...it's clear these songs weren't labored over to the exent those on ""Wide Awake"" were - there is not the same level of craft here, which the elaborate arrangements and synth treatments are not quite up to the job of hiding....skip this and go straight to ""Wide Awake""..."
1,Hate to admit I own it.,"After enjoying ""I'm Wide Awake It's Morning"" I decided to purchase ""Digital Ash"". All I can say is what a waste. The other revewer who described the album as amaturish hit the nail on the head. Banal would be a generous description of this album. The only positive point I could make about the CD is that at least the artist didn't attempt to rap. This one's so bad I'll be throwing it away ... I'd be too embarrassed to give it away."
2,Conor Oberst != Bob Dylan,"I wonder if Bob Dylan likes Bright Eyes. Bob Dylan had the tumultuous 60's to remark on and did. Conor Oberst has the turbulent early 2000's to remark on and instead decides to pout and hang his head and act cutesy and call himself ""Bright Eyes"". No one will be talking about this kid in 5 years, unless they're saying ""whatever happened to...?"" This guy is like Wilco, his music has potential but it's so totally freaking boring unless you're extremely sedated or you live in Nebraska."
5,Clean Hands,"Excellent hand soap for use in handlng contact lenses. Cleans hands, removes fragrances and leaves hands with proper pH level."
2,Needs some sharpening,"There is a germ of a good book in here. It needs to be whittled down by 50% and the characters need more personality. It has some excitement in the trading scenes, but you have to slog through worthless stuff to get to them. For example, we go through a long, dull chapter describing a visit to the narrator's mum, hear a description of his father, his father's death, etc. and it really is all for naught. I hope his other books are better. Maybe if he read some Hammet or Hemmingway he can pick up some pointers on how to make the prose more efficient."
3,"Sharp corporate thriller, elegantly written","Michael Ridpath has brought to life the dull financial markets into a lively whodunnit. Paul Murray is perhaps a little too clean cut as a London bond trader hunting down the killer of a colleague in his company.Ridpath has an elegant and easy style that carry along a sparky story. He carries an intelligent insight into his characters that lends the plot a little depth.The writing is appealing, with a prose that is understated. This is a novel I will remember with some affection"
5,Didn't want it to end,"This was the first Michael Ridpath novel that I have read and I am a fan. I got a clear picture of each character and got so caught up in the story that I hated to put it down. I was really disappointed when it ended because I wanted to immediately start a new adventure with Paul, Cathy, and Cash. Hope they make it into a movie."
4,A good mystery,"Ridpath did an excellent job of weaving information about financial markets and trading into a mystery that spans the globe from London to Phoenix. He did a great job of portraying the people caught up in the bond and borrowing industry, and the ethical dilemmas they face. I would heartedly recommend the book.I would put the book on par with Dick Francis and Grisham."
2,Plodding style and corney characters - not much fun!,"Thrillers set in real worlds are often the best escapism, I find. But not this time. Why? Because Ridpath's leaden writing deprives his setting of any real blood or believability. The result is rather tedious, because you'll find it very hard to care what happens to any of the hollow characters involved. A very over-hyped thriller..."
2,A disappointing book that fails to meet the crtitics aclaim,"I was seduced by the hyperboles on the cover ""... the thriller everyone has been waiting for"", ""Britain's most exciting new thriller writer"", but I don't think the story lives up to these comments. Paul Murray is a junior bond trader in the City of London with ambition and drive to succeed. When his colleague is found dead in the River Thames, Paul becomes the police's chief suspect. As he investigates the circumstances to her death he uncovers a large-scale fraud, and is also accused on insider dealing. It soon becomes apparent that to solve the murder he will have to solve the fraud and clear his name."
2,Terrible,"Ughh..... My gawd. These things taste awful. Has no flavor, no kick, barely even fizzes. It's rather terrible. A local charity drive received some of these and sent this off to some hungry kids in Cambodia and the kids sent the entire shipment back saying they rather risk drinking the cholera-laden water from the nearby stream. I cant recommend anyone drinking this unless they've previously had their taste buds burned off with sulfuric acid. In that case....bottoms up!2 stars...one extra because it's only 99 cents at most stores for when you have no money to quench the thirst and Arizona or Brisk arent available."
2,Led is DIM,This flashlight is worth about $10. It says a 5W led but it is very dim as compared to the Maglight 3W led 2D flashlight that sells for 50% less. Also the beam is not focusable as the maglight is.. Save your money
1,Bought three and only one worked but it didn't work well,This is my first review after shopping on Amazon for years. I was so disapointed with this product I had to write one.First off- I bought three as Christmas gifts and only one worked. And the one that worked still had some issues.To turn the light on you have to twist(tighten) the top to connect the light with the batteries. Well this sounds like it should work pretty easy but the only one that worked you had to tighten it so hard my mom and wife couldn't turn it on.Second you can't focus the light. I have a led maglite that cost about the same and you can focus the light and it's easier to turn on.There is a reason this flashlight is on sale. Save your money don't buy it.
1,Nice Light,Would not work out of the box. Amazon promptly exchanged for one that works. It is rugged and bright. I would prefer button for on off instead of twisting the head.
4,Shimano bottom bracket,"Sturdy product, (as long as you observe the installation instructions regarding the nylon bushing on the removable end). Better than original. Good price. Smooth transaction."
3,Plastic!?,"The ""nut"" on this is plastic. I wasnt expecting that. It did go together pretty easy. Dont forget the neverseez."
5,"heavy, smooth.","I bought this while trying to track down a creak in my drive train. Installed it and the creak remained! I've got a crappy crank, it turns out. Not the fault of this BB, though! This comes with a metal cup which I didn't like as much as the plastic cup it replaced."
1,Broke on the first day!,My 5 year old son received this in his stocking and it broke on the first day he played with it. The plastic shaft on the suction cup snapped right off after a few throws. He was very disappointed and wondered why they would make a ball that broke so quickly after being played with.
3,Beowulf,"`Beowulf' is an animated fantasy film based on the ancient legend of Beowulf and Grendel. This has an all star voice cast (Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Ray Winstone, Robin Wright Penn etc) and the characters they voice are animated to resemble them as well. The down side to this is that Beowulf (voiced by Ray Winstone) sounds like an east end barrow boy, which doesn't really fit the image of a medieval warrior! The story is pretty good here, although it did tend to drag by the end and it could've been better if condensed a little. This is also quite gruesome in places, and whilst not excessive by today's standards, it is a little too graphic for the 12 certificate this has. All in all this is a good, but not great animated fantasy adventure and if you can overlook the mockney accented Beowulf you should enjoy this just fine.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Beowulf,"This is a one of a kind flick, the animations is off the charts and the sound is very detailed. If you like warrior movies i would recommend this flick."
2,Lame,"Great visuals, but a long boring film. Bought it based off hype, won't make that mistake again."
5,Well written,"So many people seem to have the same issues with this movie: Not the original story, bad CGI, why does Angelina Jolie have heels. All of this is redundant. I was absolutely blown away with this movie when I saw it at the theater. I give full credit to how the writes decided to retie the story together. The opening scene was enough to keep you enticed for more. All the actors did an excellent job, especially Robin Wright Penn who I am normally not a fan of. I loved the way Grendel's mother was written. Everything about the scene between her and Beowulf made so much sense, including the fact that she was wearing heels naked (hello, seduction!). I loved how the story was meant to tie into itself. Some may never be able to accept the movie for what it was but I personally felt it was done quite well."
2,please note: this is a animated film.,"Beowulf (Unrated Director's Cut)I didn't know this would be an animated film, but it was a good one. As a matter of fact; if you do not have sharp eyes you may not notice the animation, it is that real. But just because it is animated, don't consider this one for the children, unsupervised."
4,"Strays from the source material, but still a great time at the movies!","I was skeptical about this one. I love the story. I read it in high school, and I think that I was the only student who enjoyed it, and so of course I had high expectations for this film version. I was not disappointed! The motion capture animation really takes it to an entirely new dimension. You totally feel like you are surrounded by an entirely new world...and Grendel is freaking scary. I want to go back, so that I can see it in 3D. I will buy this DVD when it comes out, and I hope that it is the R or NC-17 rated cut.By the way, this is NOT a film for children. Extreme violence and some nudity are present. Should not have been rated PG-13."
4,Beowulf Dvd Review,"Special effects are decent, any resemblance to the actual story is purely coincidental! Too bad, as most students SHOULD read originals before watching ""re-makes."""
3,"If you can get past the strobe lights during the Grendall attack, you might like it.","At least you may find it intriguing. As an English Lit geek, I've always wanted to see Beowulf as film. I knew it would be gory, but I told my husband that he could turn it off during the attack scenes. He wanted to go into it a little further before giving up and I'm glad we did. Besides having an old classic remade into a movie, the making of it was even more impressive.If you didn't like the actual movie, go into the extra features and see how it was made...Impressive!"
2,Not Impressed With Beowulf.,"Not Impressed With Beowulf.byJames P. ZaworskiI purchased this DVD with avid hopes of a good film. With billing like Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins, I expected something interesting.The story line is relatively faithful to the epic of Beowulf, but the visuals and special effects just didn't do it for me. I'm sorry to say 'ho hum' to this, but it is just another of Hollywood's attempts to make a buck.I cannot recommend this DVD."
2,Not a heroic cartoon without Bugs Bunny,"What a disappointment, way, way to far over the cartoony line. The only hero who could have saved this movie is Bugs. That, I'd like to see."
5,The start of a new generation,"Beowulf was a great movie. It was fast paced, action packed, and 3-D generated. The audience was made up of mostly teenagers but I still enjoyed it."
1,animated feature or movie,"I think that this movie has an identity crisis. Is it a movie masquerading as an animated feature or an animated feature trying to be a movie. I love sci-fi and sword & sorcery. This show did neither well. The Christopher Lambert feature was a much better adaption of this myth, although it received a poor rating."
1,Horrible!,If you must watch it then rent it. This is one of the worst movies I have ever attempted to watch.
2,Only for the kids,"Animation was excellent, the story and the storyline was boring and uninteresting and caused me to loss interest very quickly."
1,A lifeless turd... Mr Hanky's emotion & animation are superb by comparison,"I can't say it much better than a previous reviewer... ""For the first 15 minutes I thought someone was playing a cruel joke"".I was hoping for the real acting, real adventure, real animation, real drama, or real whatever to begin, but then I realized it was time to hit the stop button. What an incredibly superficial thing. Whatever this thing should be called, ""film"" or ""movie"" is not it! It's an insult to the DVD industry.I feel like calling Stan & Kenny to help me get my $2.99 rental fee back for this piece of crud."
1,CGI Mess,"its a freaking cartoon. its CGI, disappointing. What was the point of this? Sets cost to much to remake a classic like that? Hollywood destroys another classic... go rent the oldy, or better yet, read the book."
1,I hope this is not the future of movies,"The only reason that I kept watching after the first 5 minutes was to find out how much worse it could possibly be. I could not believe out of almost 200 reviews, it gets a 3 1/2 stars. What are people thinking? I am not against computer generated stuff but this is way too much to digest. It looked all fake and waxy. Nothing else. It's one thing to build a physical set (such as a city wall as in Kingdom of Heaven) then do a bunch of CG around that. It's totally another to do the whole thing in computers. I felt so cheated. This would be the last CG movie I ever watched. It would be a much better movie with real actors and some real physical sets. Even a real animation (such as Shrek) version of it would be way better than this. Two hours wasted. Avoid at all cost."
1,This is a huge mistreatment of a venerable story,"This movie is not worth the cost of a rental, and we are glad we didn't buy it. When we heard it was in the works, we were delighted to think this venerable tale would be put on film -- but our disappointment in the treatment of the characters with this cheesy animation and the liberties they took with the original story are simply unacceptable. The so-called ""special effects,"" monsters were simply laughable. Jolie looked hot in her body capture suit, but that wasn't why we rented this awful, awful, film. We didn't bother watching the final scenes unroll -- by then, the whole thing had become just a huge waste of time."
4,I don't understand? 3D?,"Isn't it offered in 3D? It was shown in the theater in 3D? We just spent lots of money for the latest shutter glasses, new living room PC, for our DLP and all the 3D movies are released in 2D? Why don't they offer it in 3D?"
3,Homoerotic Epos,"A good knight had killed a monster just to father another one with a mother of all monsters, a seductive female creature picking up among the strongest knights partners for producing world-threatening predators while paying sexual partners off with a good job - a kingship.A movie for admiring the really sexy, beautiful bodies in addition, probably, adjusted with contemporary computing as having the scenes assembled."
2,Where are the People?,"I had heard that this ""movie"" was CGI, so it was not a surprise to me when I saw it. Still, I must say I was disappointed with it for the very reason that it was CGI. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I like real people, real actors, real sets and real action. Cartoons are fine for Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, but why for a movie like this? I don't get it. I can't help but think what the result would have been if Casablanca were a made as a CGI cartoon, or High Noon or Indiana Jones. Of course the story itself is a classic. So there is no fault with the material. I just don't particularly care for CGI for the characters or sets. It has it's place, to enhance some scenes, but as the main element - thank you No. I feel like I've been shorted on the real movie experience."
3,The plot had some major issues,"The best part of this movie is the live actino animation. I thought it was fantastic and was the only reason I continued to watch the movie.The movie started off well enough. A nasty monster who had the town gripped in fear. Than from the sea comes Beowulf, we are led to believe that he is the hero to end all heros, but there is no backstory to Beowulf. I would love to no more about how he became such a warrior. Than the queen has some issues with the King but they are not explored, and the Queen appears to have issues with Beowulf but once again no character development. The overall plot seemed to be lacking and vague. When the movie was over I asked myself really what was it about, what was the moral of the story? I got out of that Beowulf was a hardcore warrior but not much else.I watched this on the recommendation from a friend and all I can say is that I was very disappointed."
5,Awesome movie and great copy sold!,"This movie's graphics were so unmatched. If you like movies like 13thWarrior and other barbaric titles. This one may be in your alley, but remember it's animation son. It's only animation."
3,good movie bad tellin of epic,this is a good movie dont get me wrong there but considering the historical treasure that is the epic of beaowulf this film came no where near honoring the story that has been dated back b4 written lanuage!! one of the oldest stories and they just killed it..... if u watch the movie please read the poem by reading it youll get a more indepth vision of this great story.but as i said its a good movie but a badd version of beaowulf..left me in a state of limbo..
3,Beowulf Movie Vs. Beowulf Poem,"I was extremely excited when I heard Beowulf was going to make it to the big screen. There had been so many failed attempts to do this epic poem justice. There was Beowulf starring Christopher Lambert in 1999 and Beowulf and Grendel Starring Gerard Butler in 2005. Both films had such promise, but I was ultimately disappointed with the changes made to the perfectly entertaining epic poem of Beowulf which in my opinion was brooding and mysterious. Finally we come to the Robert Zemeckis film of Beowulf. It was entertaining in it's own way, but ultimately fell short of what it could have been. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this film to a degree, but it wasn't as entertaining as reading Beowulf the epic poem. Zemeckis has given us so many great films, but I believe he dropped the ball on this one. If you like fantasy movies you'll like this movie, but don't expect it to do the poem justice. I had to disassociate myself with the poem to enjoy this film."
5,BeowulF - A modern Interpretation,"Neil Gaiman, who wrote the screenplay for this movie, has been heavily criticicized for taking liberties with the original epic poem. Most (if not all) of this criticism is small-minded, petty, and elitist. In fact, Gaiman has said that the ""beowulf nerds"" have been far worse than any comic book nerds that he has dealt with during his lengthy career in comics. The bottom line is that this is a film adaptation of an ancient story which had been passed down by oral tradition for centuries before it was written down (and substantially altered) by Christian monks. No definitive version of the Beowulf saga exists. This version, however, is beautifully produced, acted and told and should be enjoyed by anyone with an open mind."
2,Beowulf... woof.... woof,"This movie has great graphics, great actors/actresses (Hopkins, Jolie, etc), great writers (Writer of the comic, Sandman).... but it doesn't work. It is like mixing pizza and ice cream together because they are your favorite foods. Unfortunately.... Beowulf is a dog. Avoid this movie unless you are renting."
4,Great Movie Kept my Attention,"I loved this movie, it really keeps your attention. The animationand special effect were really good. I would go see a sequel of this movie in a moments notice. Could hardly wait for it to cometo DVD to add to my Collection. JH"
2,Flawed in the Re-telling,"There are many good things in this movie: The actual characters from the Epic, the basic setting, the intense violence, Grendel, even Grendel's mother. However, and I admit that I am biased here,I just don't think you can re-write a mythic tale that has survived for 1000 years to satisfy a modern director's idea of a good plot.This movie is not Beowulf, it is a movie based upon the Beowulf epic. As such, it changes the central theme of the actual epic: The war between heaven hell being fought on earth as a struggle between good and evil, man and monster. I suppose that modern ideas of heroism can not accept the mythic heroism of the epic, but I feel that those very ideas are what make the original epic a truly great story.Taking those elements out make this movie a morality tale about a false hero reaching redemption at last. The movie reflects the cynicism of the modern era I suppose, but it loses the epic qualities of the original poem."
2,RUN RUN while you can,"I had to watch this for extra credit and oh goodness gracious it was horrible. If you read Beowulf. This won't be anything like it, they should've at least changed the title to this movie. Barely any parts were watchable. Some Grendel parts were a bit scary, like less than an inch but that's it. The best word to describe it is ridiculous. Only a decapitated fish would enjoy this. It was incredibly cheesy: the character portrayals , the music, the somewhat good animation but what kills it most is the murder of the actual story line, oh it was just horrible!"
4,A vivid tale of triumph and tragedy,"This engaging, entertaining movie is an agreeable combination of fast-paced popcorn entertainment and literate, myth-based story telling. The animation is so realistic, however, that one wonders why they bothered animating the thing at all rather than just filming it live-action and just animating the special effects, the way ""The Lord of the Rings"" was done. In any event, this is an intense, exciting film that will more than fit the bill for a memorable home-viewing experience, expecially if you have a decent flatscreen television. The director's cut DVD has a few more snippets of violence (and possibly a little more of Angelina Jolie's character) on display, as well as a lavish array of extra features. While not beyond criticism, any shortcomings of ""Beowulf"" stand as quibbles compared to the overall success of director Robert Zemekis' ambitious project."
4,Beowulf; violent but artfully done,"The unrated version of Beowulf is more graphic than the theatrical release but it is the same story. The artwork is astounding and it is easy to forgot that these are not live actors you are watching. The story is well done too. It might be a fun game though to count how many times the hero declares himself ""Beowulf""."
2,"blood and butts, pass...","I guess I never really understood what they were trying to do with this movie. It was like watching ""Shrek"" with alot of violence and nudity. (blood and butts, if you will) By the time I got over the visuals of the movie (the ""real"" animation was pretty disconcerting at first), I was stuck in the middle of a very boring plot. I'm not sure, but I don't think it followed the real storyline of Beowulf. I was very disappointed in this movie."
4,Stunning,A pleasure to see the next level and the state of the art of computer animation. Visually stunning.
3,"Fun Movie, Wonderful Animation","I was surprised to see the movie was animated. I had not known prior to purchasing it (guess I didn't pay enough attention). The animation was absolutely wonderful. I recommend the movie on that fact alone.The story is based on an old, old epic of British literature. It's about a hero who slays monsters. Pretty basic stuff, but if you've read Beowulf you can't help but check this movie out. If you haven't read Beowulf, be warned -- it is a very difficult read due to the old English language it is written in / translated into.I didn't think it was an award winning movie by far, but I thought it was fun to watch. Warning: NOT for the children!"
1,disc won't read,"I worked on this movie so I was excited to own it. But guess what, the disc won't read in my computer's blu-ray drive. The firmware is current, and plenty of other blu-ray discs read fine. This format is crap, really isn't ready for release yet. Thanks, Paramount!"
3,"Not Bad, not sure accurate to story, a bit vaginal",This movie is a bit vaginal. Girl power. I don't like that. I liek heroism untainted by curses or woman demons having the upper hand. A bit depressing. I love the work of Robert E Howard. Such uncluttered fun. This movie was better than expected because I had heard it was horrendous. I will read the story now to see if it is accurate or if they juiced up the pussy power. Zemekis seems a weasil and he kinda is. If only John Milius was given this script.
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"For years we at RiffTrax have lived under the mistaken belief that we are Beowulf. So we were shocked when a cartoon version of Ray Winstone squeezed into a tiny pair of leather battle panties (LBPs) and set us straight in no uncertain terms. And he's right - HE. IS. BEOWULF!! Though it took some getting used to the idea that we are not Beowulf, in all honesty it's been a whole lot more pleasant to come into the office and see pants where one once saw nothing but a sea of LBPs.But if you haven't yet exceeded your limit, may we suggest you download our hilarious new RiffTrax for Beowulf in which a fully-clothed Mike, Kevin and Bill take on our less-than-clothed hero, his extremely unclothed lizardy paramour (played with big-boobs gusto by Digilina Jolie), and a disappointingly unclothed Anthony Hopkins.IT! IS! FUNNY!!!"
5,It's Beowulf + Bluray~!,"If you have not seen Beowulf yet, it is the best chance to watch it on Bluray. If you have seen Beowulf already it is the best time to own it. Why? It's on Bluray. Watch the one of the best movie with the best quality on the market now."
1,Beowulf,"It was a great elaboration of something every student has to read in school. Visualizing the monsters was difficult from the reading, it was nice to see them. The computer method for creating this movie was fascinating to learn about and may be a future trend."
4,Amazing in Digital 3-D,"The movie was pretty good, but the Digital 3-D makes Beowulf a must see. My local theater has the digital screens, so I didn't have to go to the IMAX. I had to pay $2.00 more for the glasses, but it was worth every penny. The visuals are stunning to say the least. Everything just pops out crystal clear. Without the 3-D I would have rather waited to catch it on High Def DVD, but it's really more of an event than a movie."
1,Awful,"I am very glad I bought this used. If it's awful, you didn't spend so much purchasing it. By the way the commercials were shown, I expected Angelina Jolie to be in most of this film. The characters looked like wooden figures, except for Grendel. I had a bit of difficulty understanding Grendel when he spoke to his mother. In the original epic, Grendel's mother is more beastly looking instead of a beautiful woman. It had its pretty messy moments, like Grendel tearing guys to pieces, and it had dull moments, like Beowulf and his young mistress. You pretty much had to guess that Hrothgar was with Grendel's mother and I wish they would have shown Beowulf's son in humanoid form before he was attacking in his serpent form. It was just terrible."
1,OIM 'ERE TER KILL YER MOON-STAH!,"Awful, just awful. Beowulf with a Cockney accent. CGI-encrusted actors who look like they stepped from the unrated director's cut of ""Shrek."" A script (co-written by a respected fantasy author) that follows the lead of many other adaptations by establishing an unconvincing ""personal connection"" between Hrothgar and the monsters. A battle in which strategically placed benches, mead cups, and beams cover the naked warrior's wedding tackle -- Austin Powers as Beowulf? The nadir of Robert Zemeckis' fixation on motion-capture animation."
1,Not for lovers of the poem,"Okay, I am not a huge fan of the original poem, but the movie was far worse than the story I remember. They really should have called it something else, because this was not the story of Beowulf. Also, the change of Grendels' mother from a monster to a sex goddess with built-in stilettos really killed the movie for me; I really don't think that was meant to be funny, but I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Maybe if I hadn't read the original story, I would have seen the story in a new light, but that's not the case here. Rent the movie and decide for yourself, but be careful if you ever sit through this movie with a group of English majors...although it does make for an interesting get together. lol."
1,Why?????,"Thank goodness I didn't pay to see this turkey. I admit I never read the poem, now I wouldn't get near it. I hated the half real, half animation, made all the characters dead behind the eyes. It was obvious there were actors acting (OVER-acting really,basically chewing the scenery!!!) and their images CGI'd. Why? They were ugly, waaaay too many closeups. I wondered who directed this mess, saw it was Bob Zemeckis, who gave us Forrest Gump and the Back To The Future trilogy and others. Shame on him! After the opening graphic carnage, had no desire to see anything but the ending to check the music on the ending titles."
1,"Holy Crap, That Sucked","[...] Talk about a waste of two plus hours. The animation was good and that's the only positive thing I can say about this boring excuse for a historical action movie. Let me just say this, if you saw any of the trailers you've seen all of the good parts. Don't waste your time."
3,Confused?,"I'm an English teacher. And I really want to like this movie. I have a blu-ray player, and when it comes out on blu-ray, I will probably get it, because I'm sure it will look awesome on my tv.I'm sure that after watching it several times more, it will grow on me, and I will like it more than I did when I was in the theater. But when I saw it in the movies, I was disappointed, because it is a creation based on the Beowulf story, but not a definitive Beowulf tale. He lies, he cheats, and he feels guilty for the rest of his life.Hamlet was a successful tragic hero. This Beowulf is a hero-turned unsuccessful tragedy. It's supposed to be a heroic tale, not a tragic one.Hollywood Beowulf: I'm surprised at Zemeckis. I can't show it to my students, so I can't help but be disappointed. What we can do, however, is watch it and get excited about how fun it is to eat food, drink alcohol, and get naked with somebody you love!"
2,Don't waste your time. Go download it for free if you really want to see it.,"This movie was visually awesome. Even in 2-D it was beautiful. The only drawback was the story, the voice acting, the story, Ray Winstone talking like William Shatner, and did I mention the story?If you really want to see it, highjack an IMAX so you can see it in it's intended 3-D, smoke a bunch of pot or other hallucinogenic drug so you don't really focus on anything but the visual stimuli, or download it for free. Don't waste your money."
2,It does not support the comparison wih 300...Empty!,"I wasn't that impressed by the special effects and you can clearly see that all this movie was filmed in a studio. Sometimes the landscape look ridiculous, with some horrible flashy orange sunset:it looks so artificial ! Apart from the monster Grendel (who was greatly animated I have to say), the rest fall apart as the movie goes on...Poor acting from Angelina Jolie as well, just here for the decoration. And Ray Winstone is clearly not as gifted as Gerald Butler.They tried to do something like 300, with the moral of courage and honor but it sounds...empty! Honeyed, without consistance, like a Ron Howard movie. This incredibly beautiful story deserves much better than that.."
1,"-2 bad movie ,that could have been greater than all","I think this animated live action sucks,the story is ok but differs from the saga's a+ cast for a d- bad movie.think more than twice then go home and rethink it again."
4,Beowulf,"In 6th century Denmark, Kin Hrothgar's (Hopkins) kingdom is being terrorized by the monster Grendel (Glover). The king calls for someone to come and defeat Grendel. Beowulf (Winstone) answers that call, seeking glory more than gold. On his first night there, Grendel attacks and Beowulf must deal with him. But, Grendel is not the only creature waiting to terrorize the kingdom. Grendel's mother (Jolie) and a dragon also lie in wait.Computer animated and only loosely following the epic poem, ""Beowulf"" is an entertaining feast for the eyes. I think that animation was the way to go with this story, and the images are very realistic. Voice talents of Winstone, Hopkins, Jolie, Gleeson, and Penn all fit well with the characters. Purists will probably be disappointed with the changes, but for those not familiar with the story will probably have no problems. ""Beowulf"" is a great example of how far CGI has come, and an excellent diversion for those craving some action."
1,It's okay at 16X speed....,This was just horrible. I think that I could have made a more interesting version of the story using hand puppets.
3,Shreck without the funny bits,"The story line wasn't bad. I just half expected Grendal to turn up and big a big Green guy with a scottish accent and have a dry wit, also I expected him to turn up with a talking donkey who wouldn't shut up and a cat wearing boots and a hat and a spansish accent. With all the CGI it just made me think about Shreck and I reckon that they would have been better of doing it live action with some special effect's. As the title of my review say's Shreck without the funny bits."
3,Beowolf from beginning to end,I love Beowolf as a story. I did find the movie in ways the good at the beginning. I went with the 3D version and the animation in the beginning was awesome. It was impressive. The movies storyline started out awesome. Then it started running long and boring. The story sizzle stopped after the first meeting with Grendall's mother and then went down. The animations stopped popping out a you and the ending bored me to tears because it when on and on.
2,BEOUWULF,"This sci-fi film is a bit weak, a body-enhanced second rate actor said to have acted in East Enders (a long running UK soap) fights monsters etc supposedly in the raw. The most interesting thing is not the film but the documentary showing how scenes were filmed, all the CA gadgetry that you can imagine and then some!Just watch it once to the end if you can without going to sleep first.A very forgettable endeavour."
3,Give us a 3-D dvd,My husband and I saw this at a I-max in 3-D. It was amazing. Why can't we get a 3-D DVD. I would even pay extra for this feature.
4,Beowulf,"Excellent movie, lots of action. Really keeps your interest. The animation is awesome. Definitely entertaining Would recommend to a friend for sure."
3,Awesome movie...poor quality from Amazon,"I purchased the digital version of Beowulf in order to show it in a classroom. The movie froze multiple times during the showing, and I would have to stop and reload amazon in order to get it going again. Then we would have to wait as it buffered again. As you can imagine, this was very disruptive in a classroom setting. I love the movie Beowulf, but amazon has some work to do on the streaming aspect of it."
5,I just like it!,"This movies plot/story is missing some. But I just like the action, blood and CGI which was worth it to me. It really shows off the human nature of telling tell tales and making our shelve's look better to other but in the end just look like a fool!!!"
4,"A remarkable film, for animation.","For an animated movie, this was a remarkable film. It tells the story of Beowulf in dramatic fashion and I appreciated seeing this classic tale, that I have often heard referenced indirectly but had never read. It makes one appreciate heroic, Nordic story telling, with it's many monsters and ironies.Animated charaters in a drama takes a little getting used to, especially with the celebrity actor voice-overs. The facial expressions are still not quite what we expect from humans, but they are getting closer every year."
4,HD DVD crashing,"To bad Microsoft is going to pull the plug on HD DVD so you're just wasting money... Sony wonFor the movie I loved it.. Best CG graphics I have ever seen.. Storyline is a bit bland at times but has great action scenes. If your really into looking at details in a movie this will shock you on how well they did.. Every rock, every tree, snow, water has excellent detail."
1,What a waste of money,"I went right out to buy this the day it came out. Liking the cast and director I was hoping for a movie similar to 300. What I got was Shrek 3. I was under the impression computer animation was talking about the effects used in the movie not an entire movie made on it. My misunderstanding is my loss. I would have never bought it knowing it was a cartoon. Sure call it computer animated, it is still a cartoon. I turned it off after 5 minutes and put it in my dvd collection right next to the Shrek and baby einstein DVD's. I will probably never watch it again. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY..."
1,An insult,"This film -- which it actually shouldn't be called, being animated (disappointment #1) -- is an outrage and an insult to the Beowulf epic and to Nordic tradition. The people who made this clearly believe in the idiotic revisionism of Marxists and 19th-century German historians."
1,not worth it,"i love vikings, i love celts, i have no problem with cgi films. but the story was altered too much, beowulf was too flawed, the villains mild, grendel was a let down, he was meek and a sad character (his voice sounds like a 10 year old boy.) and designed poorly. if you're religious, you may be offended as to the portrayal jesus and his followers. and the ending is unresolved. not recomended. buy braveheart instead ;)"
1,worse movie,The movie could've followed the true story that was written about Beowulf. The graphics were okay but not really a movie that I would want to puchase.
1,The Book Was WAY Better!!!,"We read 'Beowulf' in our English class last year, and I thought the story was pretty good. So, after we read it, me and my mom watched the movie. (She had not read the story.) It first started off pretty good, then later they added stuff they weren't supposed to like Beowulf and Grendel's mother had sex, making another son. In the story, he was supposed to kill her. At the end, Beowulf fights the dragon, but we find out the dragon is Beowulf and Grendel's mom's son. Grendel's mom LIVES! THAT'S NOT COOL!!! I would NOT recommend BEOWULF!!!p.s. I'm glad Disaster Movie made fun of this!"
3,Not What I Had Hoped,"I really love the sword and sorcery type of movies, so this one really seemed to be up my alley. I immediately hated the animation of the real actors. It looked very waxy and fake. I think I would have preferred to see the actors in real life with the monsters and scenery as CGI. Unless of course the technology can be perfected a bit more. This just didn't look convincing and the movements were not as fluid as I would have liked. It often reminded me of the way humans look in Shrek. The story itself is an interesting retelling of the Beowulf myth. I personally didn't find it as engaging as I would have like. Overall this was a let down for me. Some may be enchanted by the visuals, but for me it took away a lot from the story."
4,Not Bad,I was actually surprised by this movie. I read the book many many years ago. The computer graghics were quite good. This is a good action/adventure/fantasy movie if that is the correct classification. It seemed like a mixture of a movie to me.
3,The Beowulf that bites...,"This movie could have been really good. The animation was good but it actually lacked colour where it should have had more. I feel like they were trying to create an atmosphere here but just didn't quite make it with this film. The actors were good but could have been better. I suspect this movie could have been better directed. Otherwise, it is an okay film. I'd give it about a C plus at bestif it were on a grading system. I got bored about half way through the film and wished the ending would have been a bit different. If they had better music for the film, it might have created a better atmosphere for the story."
4,This not your grandfather's Beowulf?,"With monsters, crossbreeding with dragons and shape shifting thismovie plays out more like a fantasy than the elder epic classic poem.The Vikings that the poem is about are the same who raided the English coast and set up kingdoms there ( called Dane law).So this history is one of legend of a hero who overcame some sort of monsterwho ate men. That the poem was written down after about 300 yearsmakes it contemporary to the Saxon invasion of England that King Arthurwas involved with ( another legend).I liked the movie: it has been turned into a funstory of promises and revenge between men and dragons."
3,I am Beowulf!!!!,Great movie. I love the graphics. I went with a used video purchase and I could not have been happier with the service & purchase!
3,Incredible in 3D.,I think what I liked about the movie was seeing it in 3D. On DVD it is a big let down.
3,somewhat laughable,"Gosh, I remember reading *Beowulf* for Freshman Comp way back when I first started college. For some reason, along with *Gilgamesh*, this story stuck with me.Anyways, I was looking forward to this movie to see how it would be played out in a film. In addition, I was curious about this style of animation. I was somewhat impressed but, at the same time, I couldn't hold my laughter.The scene where Beowulf stripped his clothes and slept naked while his men created noises to draw out Grendel. I couldn't help but think of this portrayal of Beowulf as a ""mature"" version of Prince Charming in *Shrek*. The attempted creative ways to cover Beowulf's manhood was just cheesy.Aside from that, *Beowulf* was a fresh approach on retelling the classic story."
3,Beowulf,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. While we were surprised at the beginning to see that it was a computer-generated animation, it was still well done and exciting. We liked it."
3,"Great movie, it's not accurate.","This movie is full of blood and guts and it is incredibly entertaining, but DO NOT watch this instead of reading the poem. The plot lines about the parentage of monsters is way off compared to the text. Beware high school students!"
2,part of me wants to like this but i cant,"i rented this in 2008 (the good ol days when Hollywood video was in business) i wanted to see this, i got less interested because i did not know it was performance capture, i am not a fan of the Robert Zemeckis performance capture films me and my mom are the 1 in 3 people who didnt enjoy Polar Express, i barely liked anything in this movie back then, i thought watching it now i could like it more i still dont, this is one of those times when i finish the movie feeling nothing"
2,I HATE THIS POOR MIX OF CG ANIMATION AND LIVE ACTION!!!,"Not only this movie was poorly cg live-animated, is also kind of boring. There are some cool action scenes but many of them last like less than a minute and there were actually 4 action scenes as far I can remember. I like fantasy-adventure films but there are MUCH better movies like Conan the Destroyer, Beastmaster, Legend, Highlander or even the videogame God of War. This movie was so bad to me that I rather watch Pathfinder.If you liked Ultraviolet or 300 perhaps this movie is for you.Adios."
1,Absolutely awful,"Give this one a miss. This is definitely not the story of Beowulf. They took far too many liberties with the story and cheapened a classic epic by 1)adding stupid comic and overly sexy details; 2)using gratuitous blood spatterings and much gore; 3)altering the plot significantly; 4)making Beowulf a boastful, lying, easily-seduced muscle-bound ""hero."" Hrothgar as the father of Grendel? Honestly! Even worse, Beowulf as the father of the dragon!As a teacher, I previewed this DVD to see if I could recommend it to my students. Absolutely not! No way would I let my own children (all teenagers) see it, and I'm going to get rid of my copy as soon as possible.Disgusting!"
4,A really cool-sounding Techno-Dance song EP!,"I first heard of Gravity Kills in early 1996, when this song ""Guilty"" was being played on a local alternative rock station. It took a few listens before it started to grow on me some more, but I had no interest in buying the group's full-length self-titled album just yet. Now, I've got this awesome rockin' EP with the regular version and 8 remixes of ""Guilty"", and it also includes another great track ""Goodbye"" (the demo version and one remix) which I had heard from the ""Mortal Kombat"" soundtrack. All in all, I've decided to just keep this slammin' CD and maybe in the future, branch outward into further Gravity Kills material. But for now, this would be the absolute perfect album for blasting at high volume from your car stereo in the inner cities, man! I also recommended KMFDM and Rammstein, by the way. But that's a story for another time..."
4,Great Multiplayer Game,"I have all Turok games except for 3 and 1( I have the new Turok Evolution witch is the best one.)I play multiplayer with my 2 brothers and we also play with bots.My favorite bot is the icelord.There are tons of great levels and characters.It's also hilarious when your enemies growl when they die like ooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh or when you use the inflator to make your enimies fatter and fatter until they blow into tiny pieces of their organs.The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because in 1 player mode the enimies are running at walls all the time and and they don't even bother to shoot you so they are easy to kill.But overall the game is great!Oh,and one more thing, I doubt the M rating.It should be teen."
3,"Disappointing, but not bad","After the insane amounts of fun I had a few years back in Goldeneye's deathmatch mode, I hungered for a successor to the king of console deathmatch. While ""Team Fortress Classic"" for Half-Life (PC) surpassed every multiplayer game to date, I still needed something quick and easy to pop in when my buddies were over. I had hoped that Rage Wars would prove to be a rightful heir to 007, but it just leaves you thinking, ""This could've been so much better"". Despite its shortcomings, the game still manages to be fun, since it's playable and you can play against friends and 'bots, which do a decent job of simulating a human opponent. Give it a rent and see if you like it."
1,A bit on the slow side,"I like this game, at first. THere are many good elements, the cereberal bore, which drills out guys brains, and turrut guns, and bear traps. All in all, this game is to violent for younger gamers, it can get pretty boring one player, but the multiplayer is the best feature, if friends are always over, get it, if your looking for a good 1 player game, stay away"
1,Terrible game,"I played this game a total of 40 minutes before I gave up on it. The graphics are poor, the gameplay is difficult, the controls are bad, the concept is bad. I absolutly hate this game. I found it hard and somewhat boring to play. Though games I would recomend would be; Perfect Dark, 007 Golden Eye, Army Men Sarge's Heroes 2, Duke Nukem 64."
2,Maybe I needed the expansion pack,"I loved the first two Turok games. I rented this one, and have hesitated to buy it since I usually play games alone. I was correct in not buying it. It was pretty bad for the one player version. The graphics were fuzzy and it was way too dark (no matter how much I turned up the brightness on the game. Maybe I need the expansion pack. It was pretty boring in the single player mode."
1,not as good as the others,"This game's graphics stink. It was way too hard, and the characters moved way too fast. I don't recommend this game to anyone."
1,Worst shooting game ever!,"Of all the shooting games in the world, this is the absolute worst! The graphics are not even half as good as Turok 2, the weapons are stupid, and the enemys are the most unimaginative, stupid brutes that I have ever seen! Also, the one player mode [is terrible], and there is absolutely no challenge whatsoever. The enemys dont even attempt to fire at you! So if you are a fan of (and I feel sorry for you if you are) bad graphics, bad weapons, bad enemys, and no challenge, buy this game. Otherwise don't even waste your time turning the box over to read the back."
3,"Fairly good multiplayer, but piece of s#@t single player","This game is worth renting for the mulitplayer experience. It's preaty fun to play with a bunch of friends. On the other hand, the single player mode is downright horrible. Not only are the levels boring to play, but the gameplay is plauged by tons of bugs and mistakes. In my opinion, Acclaim is much better at producing great sports games such as All Star Baseball 2000, than first person shooters like the Turok series. Unless Turok 3 can pull it off, I'll give up all hope. Oh, and please don't get Turok 2, it also sucks."
4,A mountaineering giant,Bonnington is a giant of mountaineering. The book is a classic account of a famous expedition. Great for an armchair adventurer like me.
1,1 star for evil seller's price,"99 dollars for a 129 pages? that's like a dollar a page!!! evil person, share information."
1,Useless at best,"I am the Business Development Manager for a large electronics company, and always looking to improve my business skills. I found the book was written without a market in mind. It is some how written for a person with no experience, or education in business, who is dealing with mutli-million dollar contract in the play business. I think that rules out pretty much every person. It goes in to the basics of negotiations like ""you might need a contract"", or ""some things might be important"", and then addresses these issues in terms of a person who would need to be the best in their field to approach such situation. Badly written, no focus market, probably paid to get it published."
4,"Not the best, but better than Corporate America","Bought this about the same time Corporate America came out. This isn't the best effort of Mister Delp and Goudreau, the three RTZ cd's are more true to the ""Boston"" sound we've all grown to love.This collaboration is pretty ""soft"" when it comes to rock, the only real rocker is a live piece (Rhythm Wont Stop, tossed in to fill out the tracks, and actually one of the worst on the album. Brad refers to Barry as ""My Man""....jeesh.In any event, this is better than the lame effort from Tom and crew that was and is Corporate America. Lose the chick and stop playing country for crying-out-loud...you're BOSTON!"
3,It is ok,I liked the LED and glow shroud on this Little Ed flashlight. I have put it thru a couple of smoked filled rooms and sad to say that the non-LED version of this light penetrates the smoke better than the LED. I am debating whether or not to switch back to my old light.
5,Best cover out there,I bought this for my 2 year old who is potty training. We went through 3 other covers until we finally found this. I couldn't be happier with how it works. It's water proof with out feeling like you're sleeping on a plastic bag. It has a nice cushion and has been very durable. For affordable price and fast shipping. Will get the bigger size when we upgrade beds.
2,"Does what it claims, but....","...after a relatively short period of time it stretched out and doesn't fit well over the mattress. That being the case it's very wrinkled and the wrinkles, under the sheet, are rather uncomfortable to sleep on."
5,It keeps the mattress clean and is comfortable to sleep on.,I bought this as soon as we put our 2yr old in a regular bed. He is still in diapers but takes water to bed and sweats a ton (even with no blankets and light pj's) It has kept the mattress perfectly clean and dry. It does not feel like plastic or make noise and has been very durable. good quality. I will buy another when the next kid gets a twin bed.
5,Nothing's Gotten Thru,"I never expected to be writing this review but here it is - we get older, a spouse becomes ill with an incurable condition and we're back to protective covers and pads that are quite a bit larger than the infant ones we threw away so many years ago.This protective mattress cover is convenient to use, washes well and I would't know what to do without it.Yes, I actually use small pads on top of it just to be safe but before we had those, it was just this mattress cover alternating with a large pad as I stripped the bed in the morning, did that laundry and put it back on the bed the next day.Good product at a reasonable price."
1,"Stay away, waste of money.","We bought this product for our son's matress to help us keep it stain free as we wore going to potty training, first time he had an accident it leaked thru it, left a big stain on the matress, we had to just use plastic bags for the rest of the period. Waste of money, worthless product."
2,Was this Matt Stones first movie appearance?,"I'd like to give this film 3 stars... but I can't. Some great insights into Howard Stern and the Howard Stern show as well as some surprising interviews with other celebrities. I would have given it 3 stars if the interviews with the Stern fans weren't, in my opinion, loaded. What I mean by that is all the Stern fans, outright fans, were idiots. While some of the more normal interviews had some positive but mostly negative things to say about Stern, the all positive ones were freaks. And one of the interviews, billed as Dave Stone, looked an awful lot like Matt Stone of South Park. In fact, unless Matt has a twin named Dave, this was him. Check it out for yourself."
3,cute but not sturdy,"The picture shows what it looks like when newspaper is stuffed in it to keep it puffed up. Otherwise, it sags down like a newsboy cap. The embroidery is good but the fabric is thin and it has no cardboard reinforcement inside."
3,Very small head size,This is a very cute hat. It did fit on my 3 year old but it was tight and she would not wear it.
5,very cute and realistic hat!,I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this pilot's hat is especially considering the price. It is actually pretty realistic looking. I think it looks nicer than many of the pricey versions.
4,a little lite on the subject,at first it made me was a little nervious ordering headlighy bulbs. there are so many different ones.bt because of the cross referance on the site from amazon it made me feel a bit better.the bulbs arrived quickly. they were the rite ones to. thank you amazon for making it so easy.
2,It is ok,"This is an OK player. It is loaded with features, most of which you may not ever use. I have two of these units and both lasted about a year. The disk read circuitry failed."
1,Broken After One Year after Purchase,It works fine only for one year. Looks like it is only a cheap piece of junk.
3,Good fit - not so good adhesive,"I bought this for my 2000 Maxima SE, after we shattered the passenger side mirror. This part is a great fit, perhaps just a millimeter or two smaller than OEM but just right in shape. Unfortunately it only comes with two thin pieces of double-sided foam tape, which doesn't hold very well. I couldn't find the same adhesive that Nissan used, so I ended up using clear silicone sealant which I could remove if i ever need to replace the mirror again. I'd recommend this part, but be aware you may end up spending another $10 on adhesive. I'd give it five stars otherwise."
4,Eminently Readable Intellectual History,"If you, like me, felt bogged down in formal economics courses in college, trapped by bewildering formulae and graphic mazes, you've found your introduction to economics. This is not to say that Dead Economists is a college text, though it could be. This is an educated reader's brief introduction to the history of modern economic thought. Buchholz brings to life old ideas, as advertised. Even though somewhat dated from the 1999 revision, it rings with currency. I most enjoyed the author's essay on John Stuart Mill. Buchholz moves quickly to put important ideas in a historical and biographical context. This style resonates with a reader like me, and if you felt as I did in school, it will with you too."
4,Good read as far as required reading books go,"This was required reading for my ""Intro to Econ 201"" class at Northwestern University. The required selections were easily understandable and clear. So this made for an interesting read. This is not a subject matter I would personally choose to read if not required. But thoroughly explains Economic theories propounded by its founding fathers such as Keynes, Malthus and Ricardo and gives a little insight on their personalities through re-told stories."
4,Mandatory reading for College eco majors,"If you have even a cursory background in history, economics or finance you will find this book engaging reading and an excellent though short description of the major trends in economic history in the last 200 years. I would have given it five stars except that some of the chapters in the book are not as complete as they could have been. The chapters on Marx , Mill and Marshall were interesting and extremely well written while some of the other economists are given short shrift. This is probably a casualty of limiting yourself to just a 300 page book. But the value of the book is the accurate and balanced description of each economist's contribution to the field and development of economic thought since Adam Smith. This book is probably required reading for first year college eco majors but people of other backgrounds will also find it a good read as it is written in a light and witty style. I highly recommend it."
3,"Book has little to say, ends up being overcritical","This series of books (The <fill-in-the-blank> of Star Trek) may be winding down. Unfortunately, the main thing you can say about the computers of Star Trek is that the show's creators showed an extraordinarily lack of vision in that regard: even the Enterprise-D computer is clearly a deluxe, sixties-style mainframe and not the network of computers we would expect today.Clearly, many of the issues are for dramatic reasons: you can't have the computer fighting the battles nor people communicating with the computers through thought alone. The latter would be tedious to watch and the former would take all the interest out of it.Regardless, the book, while interesting to read, comes off as critical and even shrill as a result - not nearly as affirming or interesting a read as, say, The Physics of Star Trek."
1,"Maybe good for computer scientists, but not for trekkers","The authors have a great deal of knowledge about the actual science of computers, but they should not meddle with the Star Trek universe, since (acoording to the ""acknowledgments"" section, they had to watch all episodes of all series prior to writing the book. They call subspace ""a gas that acts as telephone wires"", they wonder why holodeck fails if the computer cores are ""100% redundant"" (have you ever heard of programming error?). If you are interested in ""The computers of"" part of the title, give it a try. If you got the book because it has ""Star Trek"" after it, dont even bother (I literally could not read past the first couple of chapters)."
1,Disappointing and Annoying,"This is just another book wherein the author takes apart a science fiction proposition by analyzing the crap out of it and desiring very much to show their own superiority. I honestly had to stop reading it altogether because of this mindset of the authors.They could have worked at integrating the science fiction of Star Trek into what we already know about science. Instead there is nothing but criticism at every turn.It's a great book if you enjoy looking for that which is bad or even a little wrong in the Star Trek universe. I guess that some kind of weirdo enjoys that pursuit. However, as an intelligent report, it fails.I am so peeved at this book that I will send it for free, no charge, no shipping, no nothing to anyone that wants it. I would shred it but that would be wasteful; it's a great example of a bad example."
3,Disappointingly boring,"I'll admit that I've read all the other science books on ""Star Trek,"" from ""The Physics of Star Trek"" to ""Is Data Human."" So I looked forward to this entry as well.Unfortunately, I found ""The Computers of Star Trek"" to be disappointingly boring. One problem that I had, but that you may or may not, is that computer architecture just is not very interesting. Thus, learning that parts of the Enterprise's computer system are useless is just not the same as learning, for example, that it would take more energy than exists in the universe to warp space enough to make the Enterprise transverse the distances described in the shows."
5,the best game ever,Since I played shadow man I can not stop thinking about it and wishing that more games would be like it.
2,Could've been a Playstation Game,"Granted, some of the context of this game, as well as the cinemas and dialogue were excellent, but overall I never got the sense that Shadowman really takes advantage of what the Dreamcast can do. I came away thinking ""Wow, I thought the Dreamcast would make for a character that runs more naturally and fluidly than Lara Croft."" Instead, Shadowman has astrange and unnatural bow-legged jog through environments that look like they could be rendered by a Playstation just as easily."
4,Give it a try if you like really good platformers,This game took me by surprise. The depth of the levels and the game play is mindblowing. I know I will get some flak for saying this but this game is as close to Metroid and any game has come in the 3D era. If the DC version turns out like the PC version and not the PSX version it will be a real winner.
5,THE BEST GAME EVER MADE !!! HAS IT ALL !!!,"This was the first game I have ever played, and it was an amazing experience. This game truly has it all, the Story, The Enemy, The Monsters, The places, The items to collect, great character !!! I have played this game 5 times already over and over and it does not stops to amaze me, how well thought it is. I truly wish there were another game just like it, but there is none (maybe one day)"
3,King of Convenience,"It's transparent that E.V. Thompson is a believer in transparency, 'cause this is one transparent book. Still an okay book; not boring, not fascinating. Just know that it's obvious in its wherefores and therefores-- it's easy to tell how a storyline will end from the time it begins-- and relies heavily on convenient events to advance the narrative.For a book with a pretty high body count and characters who are prostitutes, it's surprisingly along the lines of something Grandma would enjoy reading. 1870s, miners, do-gooding, no sex scenes, churchy leading lady, celibate leading man. If you're a senior citizen, this is where it's at!"
4,Nifty little volume,"Very good volume covering some little known units, alongside the most famous Heer units of them all (GD and Pz Lehr). Good illustrations, though colours seem a bit off. Not as good as Volstad, but better than Stephen Andrews.Good information, easy to read format. Usual cautions apply about Men at Arms works. There are better GD volumes if one is so inclined, but some of the units covered are not well represented in English anywhere else."
3,Invite to wholeness,I purchased this as a replacement so I am so thankful I could find a copy of this program.
4,The Opera According to Bartalini,"For any opera fan this book is full of laughs. The clever doggerel is very imaginative and the summaries follow the stories of the operas quite well. It could be used to refresh an opera in your mind and get a lot of laughs at the same time. The illustrations, also done by Bartalini, are clever and to the point of the opera being summarized. It makes a very good gift for someone you know who likes opera and has a sense of humor, or even if they don't have a sense of humor."
5,Healing Options: A Report On Graves' Disease Treatments,"I highly recommend it to individuals with Graves' disease as well as their family members, health care givers, and therapists. Having recently been diagnosed with Graves' disease I found the book very informative and helpful. Giving a list of the symptoms as well as the different types of treatment for Graves' and actual stories of those with the disease. Specifically, the author. Especially since my doctor didn't provide me with any information. It explained muscle weakness as well as other symptoms/side effects of Graves' disease."
2,Healing Options,"I bought this book in an attempt to learn more about new options in Grave's treatments. I assumed by the title of the book, that Ms. Flax found a way of conquering Graves. Unfortunately ""Healing Options"" tells the story of her continual struggle with Graves. While it is a true representation of a chronic illness, it is neither an uplifting or comforting story. Ms. Flax covers the current Western methods of treatment. She does this by offering examples that illustrate the downside of each treatment. It is difficult to accept the alternative treatment methods she promotes (i.e.: massage, herbs, meditation). She was not originally treated with any of these methods and it is uncertain whether her outcome would have been better or worse. For me, the valuable information Ms. Flax provides is over-shadowed by her depressing and sad biographical narrative."
3,A Dated introduction to X ray Astonomy,The book gives a good coverage of the history of X ray astronomyand the location of know x-ray sources in the sky.The section on binary stars and Algol-like systems with large mass transferis very good. The x-ray spectra of galaxy NGC 4151 seems very like the Jeans mass function so that the peaks may be recombination energies.I found the book interesting and the figure and pictures useful.
4,Puma Cellerator Shudoh 2 GCI FG,The Puma Cellerator Shudoh is an awsome cleat. Its extremely light weight and has an amazing amount of support. The only thing I do not like about the Shudoh is the stud configuration on the heal of the shoe. There is too much of a flat surface and I have a really hard time getting them the grip the ground. Other than that they are great!
2,losing by yourself,"The consept is good. The setup is like a board game and is perfict for kids under 7. The bad paart is if you play single player and the computer is your opponent you are certain to lose. the computer always wins nomatter what. It is only fun if 2 people play together. So, unless you have a person to play the game with, don't get it."
2,Not recommended,"This product provides further proof that you get what you pay for. While it was less expensive than competing products, it came with very little documentation, and our first attempt to refold it resulted in it's becoming permanently deformed. We were able to restore it to a marginally usable condition, but we never tried folding it up again. Spend a few more bucks and get a better product."
1,a good starter net for a pitcher,"this net is NOT for kids with a 60-75mph fast ball pitcher, it however would be best suited for ages 5yrs. to maybe 11yrs. not for teen age tho. wish they would age rate."
1,DO NOT BUY,I have had this net for less than one year and my 7 & 8 year olds put a hole thru it hitting baseballs off a tee. The pitching target catcher straps are all broken. The quality on this is horrible. I will not buy another Easton product because this was so bad.
1,Pitching screen,The product is very well designed and very useful for my daughter to practice softball pitching but onabout the 5th pitch she threw the upper left hand strap that holds on the target snapped and is now being held on by a safety pin. I wish you would replace that for us and then maybe I would give this an excellent.
2,junk,Metal frame twisted the first day we set it up. No way to twist back rendering the net useless. Now has to be tied up against a fence which defeats its purpose. Junk.
1,Not a good product,"I bought this net for my boys and after 3 months fo use, the frames are becming weak and the net is not holding up. The height of the net is about 80% of what is used to be and it looks terrible. As others have recommended, do not buy this product as it is a very poorly constructed product. Pretty dissapointing considering it is a Easton brand product. This product definitly puts a stain on thier brand image."
1,Broke within an hour,Do not waste your money. My 13 year old son used it for less than an hour and the elastic attachments broke.
1,poor quality,"Let me start by saying I own a lot of Easton products and am, for the most part, very satisfied with the quality. With this specific product I cannot even come close to saying that. The tabs that hold the net in place broken very quickly and I needed to come up with a solution on my own. Now, after the unit was stored indoors all winter, every time you hit the ball into the net it tears a hole in it. I called Easton for assistance and they told me that first of all the net cannot be replaced alone, you need to replace the entire unit and secondly it comes with a 3 month warranty - to me that says you do not believe in your product. To say I am less than thrilled in an understatement"
2,Cheap and not durable,The first problem is that you cannot fold the thing up. Then the sock net does not last either. I broke two of the straps so that made that useless. I got frustrated with it today trying to fold it up and bent the frame and threw it in the trash. It just makes me sick that I spent $79 on something that flimsy and cheap. Buy the jugs net instead. It is better and it will last you forever.
2,Nothing but aggravation,"This net was wonderful for the first 2 times we set it up and folded it back into its case. After that, it was impossible to fold back into the case and the steel frame became permanently deformed. It is still somewhat usable but by no means is the ""portable"" net that we were hoping for."
4,"A Good, Beat-Pounding CD","If you liked the movie, you'll love the CD. A good mix of hard rock (Fear Factory) and techno (KMFDM). If you are home by yourself and need something to rock out to, buy this CD and pop it in. Only problem was trying to find it because most stores don't order the CD anymore."
3,unlike the movie,I bought this cd for my son and it only has 3 songs from the movie(s). I don't know where they came up with the other songs from.
4,"Like the game, it kicks a**.","Unless you're a diehard ""Mortal Kombat"" fan, you're getting this just because it's a good industrial-techno-metal mix, and it is. Almost every track here rocks, regerdless of the genre, but the ones I like most are from ""Orbital"", ""Utah Saints"", ""Type O'Negative"", and ""The Immortals"". Good tunes for gameing, or your next hardcore party. If you like this soundtrack, check out ""The Crow"" and ""Cool World"" too. Now that it's 2004, you should be able to find all of these used."
5,A Kick Ass Soundtrack!,"For all you people out there who liked the music from the movie, get this soundtrack! It is full of cool songs. It remains pretty heavy throughout, but it also has a heavenly moment courtesy of Orbital. Definitely worth it. Also, if you like this soundtrack, check out Mortal Kombat More Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation. They are all just as good."
4,A Great CD For A Great Movie!,This CD has some awesome tracks from the movie. The KMFDM song is great and so are many others. Buy this CD and you'll be screaming MORTAL KOMBAT!
3,Decent Soundtrack,"This soundtrack fits the movies atmosphere except someof the tracks suck. The best tracks are Goodbye (Gravity Kills), Juke Joint Jezebel (KMFDM, best track!), Sister Machine Gun (Burn) and Bile (Reject). Than some tracks stink ie: What U See (Mutha's Day Out), Twist the Knife (Napalm Death), and the theme from Mortal Kombat (both the Immortals and Utah Saints). Get it for KMFDM."
4,I like it,"XP is great. i had my v505EC customized. I mostly use sony products like camcorder, cameras etc so its a breeze to transfer photos or file.At 40G, its not good enough for videos. I need at least 100 Gb for 3 hours of videos on file. This good enough for photo editing, some storage and doing your file.Overall, Im satisfied."
2,Just another basic book!,"This is just another in a long string of basic books. Not much different than the FileMaker Bible.No inight into proper database design, nothing on multiuser considerations, nothing on using FileMaker Server, or how to use FileMaker with MS Office.The book even say's that ODBC is beyond the scope of the book! Some companion! You can find the same information in the FileMaker manual or the on-line help."
2,Look further if you need information beyond the manual,"This book has proved not so helpful to me as a novice filemaker user looking to gain knowledge on many of the not so well documented features. The writing could be much more precise and I cant help but beleive much of the book is ""filler"" and general commenting on the program itself, not actual useful information on how to make better databases."
1,Terrible Movie 101...,"As a horror movie fan, I bought this movie ( previously viewed, thank goodness). Reading the box, it looked like it might be a good horror flick. How wrong was I !!!!! This movie shouldn't even fall into the horror catagory. The whole movie is about a teenager, Casey Noland, who aspires to be the next famous serial killer...... Not! He can't even bring himself to harm the next door neighbor's dog! What makes this movie even more stupid is the fact that his ""gothic"" friend wants to become his first victim. Together, they think of ways and weapons he can use to make him ""different"" from other already known serial killers. This movie is more funny than horror which still isn't saying much for the film. With a stupid plot and poor acting, I don't recommend this film for any true horror film fan for it is not a horror movie at all. Don't be fooled by the box...... it's not worth the money even to rent it."
3,Somewhat of a pleasant surprise,"When I first put the film on, my expectation level dropped. Camera work seemed a big amateurish, and the characters a bit annoying. As the film went on, the characters kind of grew on me. The plot was ok, but no real surprise ending as the movie guides you into the big reveal.I have to say this movie made me lol a couple of times. The Corey Feldman scene was memorable and quite comical. Having said that, most of the attempted comedy in this film is lame.Overall, a decent watch on a rainy day, but not much more than that."
1,SERIAL KILLING FOR DUMMIES,"Lisa Loeb was 34 years old when she made this movie, playing a mousy 17 year old. Justin Urich plays a morose lad whose ambition in life is to be a serial killer, and Loeb wants to be his first victim. It's all slowly paced, poorly written and Loeb is simply awful. Urich does a little better but the whole plot is so ridiculous one doesn't really care. And what a shame to see future Oscar nominee Thomas Haden Church in a disastrously bad performance, so Rod Steigerish in its delivery that he definitely should've gotten a Razzy that year.Ho hum, what a drag."
4,Good textbook,"The book is very well written for beginning students of classical Chinese (before the Han Dynasty). Its explanations of characters and choice of excerpts are clearly very carefully thought out. The layout makes the content straightforward to learn. Would definitely recommend not just for classes, but for self-study as well."
2,Not appropriate 13 or below in my opinion,"My fourth grader brought this home from his school's library. He was bothered by parts were the boys are trying to get a girl to stand up while she's tanning with her bikini top undone. This happens several times over the course of the book, like an underlying theme. Very age inappropriate for kids under thirteen, I think. If there had been any indication that the characters had been punished for this behavior, or felt guilty about it, or if the girl had stood up for herself and told the boys to leave her alone, I might have felt differently about this book. As it is, it's just wrong, and not something kids under 13 should be exposed to."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I have never bothered to write a review before, but after reading the other reviews people have written of this book, I am at a complete loss to how they can give it 4 stars. I had no problems with the graphic nature of the book. However, the characters had no life to them - their actions and histories have mysterious motivations that are alluded to but never explained; they do nothing but ride horses, get drunk and have abusive sex. The story goes on and on and on, and there is no plot, no climax, no resolution. We know Lee can't handle intimacy after the first sexual scene - nothing in the next 300 pages dds any clarification, meaning or resolution to this storyline."
2,Pretty lame.,"The book was written assuming everyone was familiar with horse riding lingo and drug lingo. I've ridden a horse once in my life, and I was never a heroin user. I was lost through alot of the book.. Honestly halfway through I wanted to put it down but I can't do that.. I finished the book and normally I feel something when I'm done. I just turned the last page and said.. ""Hmm, thats it?"" There wasnt much of a plot or point to the book. It is very graphic in the sex scenes. I do not belive I would recommend this book to anyone. It wasnt worth the ten bucks."
3,"Good modes, but horrible Game Play","The out of game play is good. I love the franchise modes, it is one of the only basketball games that has that. Too bad this mode is the only advantage to the game. It has horrible gameplay! If you are buying because you like taking a team through multiple years, it is a good game, but if you want good gameplay, dont come anywhere near this game!"
1,gamera fan,the package is clearly labeled Gamera:war of the monsters!!!Gamera:Guardian of the universe isthe 1995 reboot that not listed as in this collection!!!the picture on the package is clearly the 60s-70s version of Gamera
3,Fade Cream,"I ordered this cream anticipating some results to fade dark marks on my face. I have used almost the entire jar and my skin hasn't shown any improvement thus far. One thing for sure, it helped to make my skin smooth. Evidently, it has a great moisturizer because my skin never feels dry."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I bought this version of Don Carlos because it had Peter Mattei in the role of Rodrigo. I am aware that others do not think him suited to this role, but I enjoy his smooth melodic interpretation and wonderful range. The other members of the cast were also very good, and the only disappointment for me was that it is a live recording, and consequently, it is not up to the standard normally associated with a studio recording. Nevertheless it was well worth the price, as I bought a used copy which was claimed to be as new,and it was true to description. .."
3,Uneven material,"This book provides a fair introduction to geology with fairly clear diagrams and introduction to basics such as geological time scale and plate tectonics. The book tries to emphasize the practical side of geology: what can be seen and picked up. The introduction to common minerals was perhaps not as practical as I'd hoped, for some of the minerals without picture and just a description of chemical structure, hardness, and gravity I could not identify them. The information level was uneven: ""a backpack full of rocks can be heavy"" to arcane (The chemical reaction with feldspar to produce clay minerals). The section on different rock types was well done, but the section of mapping didn't seem practical (I couldn't really map a bed of coal). I think this book might be best if used with a very local or state geology guide."
4,Great general geology book,Just the right mix of science and general reading. Great graphics and photos. Lots of info for the price. Book is pretty rugged and the pages have good weight. Good book for just sitten 'round an reading.
4,intro to rocks,Not a bad intro to geology for older kids or interested adults; well-illustrated and clearly written.
2,Poor Quality - Missing Parts - Not recommended,"We received this product and it was missing parts, which delayed us being able to assemble the unit. However we called the company for the parts and they did send them out quickly.The front door has vertical lines, and the paint in the lines is all cracked which makes the appearance look really poor. We won't be ordering from this company again. Poor workmanship."
2,only 2 because of shipping,No matter how nice it is these cabinets are too expensive when the shipping is almost the same price as the cabinet itself! I wanted to buy a cabinet but since shipping is so expensive I will go to a B&M store instead.
1,CAN'T SAY YET,"I have been looking for a buffet and I think I found it . There is only one thing wrong , as I was looking some items have the diminions ,but as alway what I want doesn't . If it does I couldn't fine them. So maybe you could put the diminions out front by the item and people like me can see them to know if they will fit where I want to put it or not. When I find out what they are Im sure that is what I want and been looking for. I gave it a rating of one because I don't know yet sorryBetty"
2,wrong picture,"This is not the right picture for this item. I have ordered twice because this is the one I wanted and both times I have been sent the wrong one. This style with the bead board door is no longer available. The first one I kept because they issued me a 10% discount, but the second one I refused shipment on. Come on Amazon please get you adds right!!"
4,One of Dickens' best!,"Have been trying to read or reread all of Dickens. This is one of his best and funniest. Excellent reportage on the society of the times, particularly class stratification and the prison system."
3,As you can see...,"I found this book to be very informative, and the authors quite knowledgeable. Stylistically, however, they have a tendency to spoon feed the reader. I have crossed out more than ONE HUNDRED instances of the phrase ""as you can see."" The use of meaningless redundancies is a crutch that becomes a distraction to the reader. I also think the book could have been better proofread as I've found many slips, like saying parenthesis when they mean single quotes. The term ""STRAIGHT JOIN"" is written with an underscore in *every* instance - ""STRAIGHT_JOIN"" is not valid mysql syntax."
1,"Prints fine, but unable to clear jam","Print quality and speed is great, doublesided and networking capabilities worked fine on Windows and Linux computers, however once this printer jammed (after 75 pages), it was impossible to clear. The little thumbwheel you are supposed to turn to roll the jam out is impossibly stiff and despite spinning it enough in both directions to raise a blister, did nothing to free the jam. The space between the rollers is inaccessible and without special knowledge of the printer, the rollers are impossible to separate in order to clear a jam.I returned the printer - even if a service desk had been able to clear it, I do not want to be able to print at the convenience of a service desk."
3,Pretty Nice Machine,"Pro:Fast copies and printingGood image quality (though perhaps not quite up to standalone copy machine quality)Good scanning abilityCon:Paper tends to curl after going through impressionUnwieldy manual feed handler (awkward to change between letter size and envelope)On 30th day, began printing black splotches at regular intervals--apparently from a drum in the process; I hadn't handled the drum, so this was apparently caused by the machine itselfGets confused when multiple functions run concurrentlyAnnoying buzzers (e.g. when you open paper tray to put paper in)High toner consumption"
1,slow,"i've had this printer for years. its great to have a real laser fax combo, as I really don't like ink jets. But its so slow to RIP and print files."
2,Poor customer service,"Here it is a month later and we are still awaiting for the extended warranty contract, even after multiple requests for same."
1,Bad Design - Does not do as advertised!!!!,This is a poorly designed device and it does not work as advertised. (Gave it 1 star since you cannot give it 0 stars.)Items that do not work as advertised:1) document feed chokes at more than 20 pages.2) double sided copying is a joke - the LCD coaches you to manually turn over the pages - this is NOT done automatically as is the case with most double sided copying.3) USB connection does not work with Windows XP media edition.4) PC fax receive does not work with the network connection.5) Tech support will eat hours of your time and produce no constructive results.Stay away from this product. I purchased other Brother products that I am satisfied with - see my ratings - but this is a total rip-off.I'm shocked since it was so highly rated by PC mag and CNET. Watch out!!!!
5,a unique new voice,"With Spilling Clarence, Anne Ursu accomplishes something most writers aspire to and few achieve. This book establishes Ms. Ursu as a unique voice, with a distinct world view peppered by humorous observations, rich characters, and smart insights into the dynamics of life in America. Through the eyes of the people of Clarence, Ms. Ursu displays the many and varied ways that people respond to life, with fear, regret, and honest self-appraisal. And she does so brilliantly. A powerful debut."
5,What a find!,"What a find! A laugh-out-loud, cry-out-loud story, this rollicking, highly intelligent novel spins a tale of remembrance and love in the aftermath of a chemical spill. In the town of Clarence, characters you'd like for friends share heartbreak and hope as a mysterious vapor releases full recall of their triumphs and tragedies. With shimmering sentences, Anne Ursu creates an engaging, entrancing, and evocative world and explores the poignant nature of human relationships.One cautionary note: Unless you want to become acquainted with the person seated next to you -- do not read this book on public transportation."
5,Truly distinct. Wonderful.,"How exciting to find an innovative piece of fiction that is so appealing. This novel has such an original voice, has such a quirky sense of humor, and such a magnificent narrative pace and style.Sometimes attempts at literary innovation mean the author is trying to belong to some ""high art"" literary club, means the author forgets the poor reader along the way. Not here.Ursu is an intelligent, yet very feeling author.I'll be recommending this novel for a long time to come."
2,"good premise, but.....","I found the premise of this book to be fascinating and full of potential. Unfortunately, it features a disappointing and somewhat cliched plot development with an overly cutsie writing style.I could not develop a connection to or emapthy for any of the characters, could not figure out where the story was going as it dragged on for 200 plus pages, and found the ending to be a dis-jointed segment unto itself. The book reads like a screen play for a sappy made-for-TV movie. I read it for my book club, and found myself surrounded by a room full of ""amazing"", ""5 stars"", ""deep, creative"". All I could think was....""I guess that's whay they call it chick lit"". I had high hopes for this novel; what followed was a dumbed-down fleshing out of its premise."
5,Intelligent and Highly Original,"Ms. Ursu's stimulating debut novel, about memories recovered in a highly original way, belongs on the same shelf as Alan Lightman's ""Einstein's Dreams"" and Charles Baxter's ""Feast of Love"". Book discussion groups will eat it up."
3,disappointing,"I was a little disappointed that the story didn't seem to go anywhere. I found it easy to read b/c I thought for sure there was going to be some great moment. I never saw it. It seemed to get a bit ""soap opera-y"" at times too. It's a light read. If you don't go into it expecting much, it would be a fine read."
5,Depth and grace.,I entered this novel hoping for the great read promised. Spilling Clarence delivers. Ms. Ursu's writing is full of nuance and resonance. What appears to be a simple turn of phrasing is deftly intertwined in one or more characters' past or present. An unfolding joy.
1,"Intriguing idea, but . . .","The idea is intriguing, but the result disappointing. The writing style is simplistic and repetitive; in sharp contrast, for example, to Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections, where the style is overly complex and arrogant. Moreover, the characters are never really developed beyond cliches, and crucial plot lines are dropped. (What if memories really are simply creations rather than a replay of facts?) And for readers who have even a bit of education in the neuropsychology of memory, the inaccuracies of the science will be too distracting to allow enjoyment of the story. I, for one, will pass on Ursu's next attempt."
5,Incredible writing,"It is great to see here that so many other people have discovered and loved Spilling Clarence! What a great book.I especially enjoyed how Ursu can say so much in so few words. That is a virtue I wish some other writers would pick up.I also really loved the humor of this book. There are some very serious issues to be faced by the people of Clarence, but the humor relieves the reader throughout."
1,Bleakness based upon an unproved theory,"The crux of the authors' argument is based upon a subtle assumption (in the preface, no less!). Once you accept that, then their ""we're all doomed and nothing we can do about it"" thesis acquires some weight and becomes truly depressing.My thought is: if we're preprogrammed to be the way we are, and the way we are makes us destined to destroy the earth and ourselves, then why write the book?This was really a dark, unrelenting journey of hopelessness. What I don't get is the other reviews: what is there to ""get""? I'm being told I can't do anything to change this person's horribly bleak vision of destruction. I'm just ""made"" that way.I'll stick with Edward Abbey and try to do something constructive in my world."
1,How Disappointing!,"I was really looking forward to reading a new author; I love children's books. But ... this author's not worth your time or money. The writing is pretty bad - repetitive, unimaginative. Also, he misuses words - ""span"" for ""spun,"" for example,on page 28 of the paperback edition. (Where's the editor?) He doesn't develop characters well, just sort of plops them on the page. Descriptions are simplistic and, again, unimaginative. Yuck. I stopped after 32 pages.If you're looking for good kids' books, try Philip Pullman, Eleanor Farjeon (somewhat oldfashioned and terrific), E. Nesbit, and, of course, J.K. Rowling, whose writing has only improved over the course of the ""Harry Potter"" series.Susan PrinceAlta, CA"
2,faint high-pitched squeal makes it unusable in quiet settings,"I agree with other reviewers that the sound quality is excellent for a speaker system of this size and price. Unfortunately, both the first one I received and the replacement that Amazon sent emit a faint high-pitched squeal when turned on - whether the ipod is playing or not, even when there is no ipod docked. Fine when listening to loud rock - you'll never notice it - but it's like fingernails on a chalkboard when playing quiet music to fall asleep to. I loved the original InMotion speakers, and am disappointed that these are unusable. Perhaps I got unlucky in receiving two defective units, but two strikes I'm out - I'm heading for another speaker system.On another note, Amazon's return/replacement system couldn't have been better - a few clicks generated a return label and the replacement arrived in two days. Just wish I weren't using it again already..."
4,iM11BLK,"Adequate sound quality, comparable with price paid.Recommended for people who prefer portability over high end sound quality that these devices can not provide anyway due to their small size."
5,This is without a doubt one of the most prized books I own.,"Carl Brenders is my idol as far as artists go. I work constantly to try to be as good as he is. I don't know that I will ever achieve that. He is beyond words. God has given him not only the gift of art, but Carl's love of God and His world have been formed into this exquisite book. It is one of my most prized possessions."
3,...Alright...,"This book was o.k., and a little weird. Though I probably would not consider the actual writing very good (quite a few typos, and some neglected puncuation)the ideas that are formed in your mind when you read are very real. Self-mutilation is growing more and more popular in the U.S., and people really need to start accepting this more as a real issue. Also, just because you cut yourself DOES NOT mean you have a mental problem, afterall... Overall, I think that this book was pretty good, but could have been better. It left some to be desired, though the haunting realness of the book, especially at the end, really brought it all together. I think that this is a good book if you or a 'loved one' cuts, but I certainly wouldn't suggest it for some random, light reading. Thank you."
3,No editor???,"I thought this book gave a very realistic view of mental disorders, although there seemed to be no punctuation what so ever and the spelling left much to be desired."
5,Well written story,"Ms. Wilson does an admirable job of character development in Saint Jude, taking you on a journey into subject matter few writers tackle. She creates complete empathy for the often shunned and misunderstood members of society who deal with mental illnesses, giving incredible insight into their trials and tribulations, hopes and dreams. Her descriptions are vivid and her dialogue witty. My favorite line from the book is when the new, no-nonsense director of Saint Jude, Dalton, suggests to Taylor, ""Why don't you let God go to high school and you can run the universe?""Well worth your time."
1,YAK! One star is too much!,"This is probably the laxest, most uninspiring Bruckner Ninth since the old Adler performance of the corrupt Loewe Edition of the Symphony. Tempi drag and nothing really sems to emerge. Avoid this and get Kurt Eichhorn's performance with the Linz Bruckner Orchestra on Camerata."
4,Good Looking Video,"Athough all the information on this video says the running time is approximately 30 minutes, it actually is 54 minutes - and that's a plus because the video is very entertaining and well done. However, the layouts were too busy and were trying to accomplish too much for my taste. But one certainly couldn't argue with the quality of workmanship and detail. All of these gandydancers should be (and are, I think) proud of their creations. The video was well-worth the price."
1,Not what I expected,The quality is not the best. It feels flimsy and like it'll not stand the wear and tear of traveling well. It's too much hassle to return. Live & learn.
4,Easy to hold and creates a clean sound,On non-metal strings these picks create a clean and sweet sound. I like them as a change from the softer muted finger picking tones.
4,rubber guitar/uke pick,These are the best picks I've found for the ukulele. Downside - they wear down and leave some rubber residue on the instrument. Upside - easy to wipe off.
2,The Not-So-Good pick,"I bought pick, wondering what a rubber pick would be like. These wedgie rubber picks are much easier on the fingers, you can grip as hard as you like, and the softness will not rub your fingers raw. On the other hand, the rubber easily grabs onto the strings, getting stuck, and basically makes it impossible to play with, unless you are just picking and not strumming. Good idea, but I don't suggest these."
2,Not for ukulele,"I'm sure it's a fine pick for other purposes, but it's not for the ukulele as advertised, unless you only want to do ONE (strong) strum."
1,Muted sticky sound,These picks do not add a natural finger plucking sound to your playing. All I got out of them was muted twangy sound. They stuck to the strings so much I had to strum twice as hard to get half the sound. The rubber also left scuff marks all over body of my instrument. Terrible purchase. Try something else.
2,not impressed,"I got the soft rubber picks for playing my ukulele and I did enjoy the sound that they produced. It sounds like playing with fingers because you get none of the clickity clacking of a pick on the strings. The problem I had with them is the way they disintegrate as you play. They are exactly like using a rubber eraser to strum, and they will coat your lovely instrument in sticky white flecks. It looks like the ukulele has a bad case of dandruff. After afew weeks all you are left with is a little rubber nub that is good for nothing. I switched to felt picks and have been much happier."
1,what a drag,"A beginning uke player, have trouble holding onto the felt pick, so thought this one might make it easier. It's supposed to be soft like a finger. It IS easier to hold onto, but it REALLY drags across the strings. Doesn't feel at all like real fingers on the strings. Too much work for me to use it. For guitar, think a regular pick and some Gorilla Snot might be the better choice. For my uke, guess I'll stick with the folded paper pick, like Dad used to use."
2,Romances,"I was expeting something akin to the family sagas when I read this and was disipionted. The stories are not as reallistic as the family sagas. The stories are Arrow-Odd, King Gautrek, Halfdan Eysteinsson, Bosi and Herraud, Egil and Asmund, Thorstein Mansion-Might, and Helgi Thorisson."
5,Read this book to gain solid knowledge.,"At first there were Phonecian and Greek alphabets, then Roman inscriptions. Letterforms evolved over thousands of years. Buy this book, you will learn how to study letterforms historically.Table of ContentsIntroductory NoteRecollections of Stanley MorisonOn the Classification of Typographical VariationsOn some Italian Scripts of the XV and XVI Centuries"
2,Not sure if it's worth it.,"Let's face it, chances are, we are not going to see any of these words in the SAT tests. Nevertheless, it's always good to know a few big words. This book certainly makes it easy to memorize vocabs. But if you just want to improve your SAT scores, it may not help you at all."
1,Your money would be better spent elsewhere,"If you don't mind listening to noise, then buy this cd. Otherwise, check out another title with quality music."
1,This Game not For Children under 8,"Hi! I have 2 daughters under the age of 8 who could not get past the first level of the game after playing it for a week! They love Mary Kate and Ashley and couldnt wait to receive this game so it was a huge dissapointment to them when they had to keep re-doing the same screens over and over again! I'm sure this game would be loved by children older than 8, or for children who've had years of experience on their Game Boy!"
2,ugh!,we just bought this game and i think it is horrible! i am trying To convince my daughter to return it and pick a different one. the sound is terrible and all fuZZy and annoying and the graphics stink! i was so dissapointed in this game and my daughter has not even picked it up since a week ago when we first brought it home! i just thought it was awefull and a waste of money.
3,Great but much too easy,"I played this game, and although it is really great to see a game about Mary-Kate and Ashley, it was too easy. I finished it in two days. If you like the Olsen twins, then this is a good game for you. If you don't (really) like them, then consider buying a more challenging game."
3,The Mystery Game,"The game is as discribed, but the screen is a little dark and you can barely make out what they say when they talk, I think if someone isn't site impared with a little practice this game could give hours of fun."
2,Alright for younger girls,"I bought this for my daughter, 10 at the time,and she enjoyed it somewhat. Though it did not hold her attention long. She said it was fun,but she became bored with it after about 2 months. It has since passed on to my 8 year old niece. Who pretty much gave it the same review."
3,I guess it's ok- but not my 1st choice,"Well, i guess I would say this game is pretty challenging but it's also sort of boring. The characters don't look like the olsen twins too much and the levels are sort of boring looking and are not colorful at all. If you aren't expecting very much, you will be happy when you play this game but it's not even close to how great the crash bandicoot and spyro games are for the game boy advance console."
1,............Um.......... I think u ALL should read this 1!,"Well for starters this game, well to put it nicely..... this game stinks! I truely think this game will last as long as The Magic Show starring Magic Johnson (the basketball player,or even less). No offense to the Olsens *cough cough* but if I were them I'd run and hide! It's bad enough to be that annoying, but gosh! Heck when are they gonna go out! at 30 they'll be in a game Olsens Get Married ..... to each other*ha ha ha ha ha ha!...... anyways..... I wouldn't buy this game! Don't ruin your child's future (or Christmases! ) I'd rather play the Spice Girl game! If you buy this game your eye's must be tighter closed than Brock's! . Pokemon the journey's just begun Pokemon, to new adventures.....!"
3,Surprisingly heavy,"These spoons do the job, but they are a lot heavier than most measuring spoons. (I would have preferred a lighter set.) One other thing to consider is that their round shape makes it difficult to dip into containers with small openings."
5,This is hard...,Hardcore with a touch of commercial sound. Catchy hooks and lots of perfect samples. I love the misery feel of this CD. It will break you down and blow you up... if you let it.
4,Confused,"This CD is good, but why is every song one word, i suppose it is Gravity Kill's own style? also, i thought someone switched the cd with a NIN cd, because it almost sounds just like them, including the vocals, and the lyrics.I still think NIN is better"
4,"good, but not as good as nine inch nails","gravity kills came around after the success of nin, and it is obvious that nin have influnced them, this album has some great moments and original songs, but it is let down by and average singer, good, but could have been ever better!"
3,Not an impressive Debut,"Industrial music is a funny thing its hard to be innovative. NIN did it with Pretty Hate Machine and so are Filter who has again managed to break into the scene. Gravity Kills are an average band , the sound is not substantial. Stabbing Westward through heartfelt lyrics manage to outclass Gravtiy Kills in every way. Im sorry to say it but GK sounds rushed and you would be best to invest in NIN or Stabbing Westward."
2,Its interesting but thats all..,This cd is quite uniquely made but I dont really like it... its up to you to judge..Maybe im just not into this sort of music ;)
4,WOW...Be prepared !,"This album has a scence all it's own. Can anyone imagine mixing old Metallica and Madonna together? Gravity Kills has done it!I just wish people would stop comparing these guys to NINE INCH NAILS! NIN is a mealody-less, noise-making piece of trash band. Gravity Kills has more style and purpose - without making us depressed. Great CD, guys !"
5,Great new taste of somthing different,"Gravity Kills, a band that combines the sounds of todays hard rock and underground techno music, has really done it with their recently released self-titled album. It has been used in multiple video games, Espn's the X-games, and several movie soundtracks. They really know how to appeal to a younger generation and hopefully will continue to pump out more great songs."
2,"boring, derivative, dull","Don't get me wrong, I'm not some N'Sync groupie berating ""heavy"" music. I love industrial music, but Gravity Kills just falls flat. The songs are bland and uninspired, like a second rate Stabbing Westward or budget-bin Filter. The songs take no risks and are quite forgetable.Their song ""Guilty"" was on the movie Seven, I believe, and while pretty good by itself, cannot carry the whole album, especially when the rest of it sounds exactly the same. Yay, they have distortion pedals! The titles could use some work, too... they're all.... blah.I give the CD 2 stars on the strength of ""Guilty,"" but that's being generous. You're better off buying Stabbing Westward or NIN, two bands they attempt to immitate but which are much more creative within the genre."
5,Great Breakup Book,"This hilarious book hides some hard hitting truths about our relationships, insecurities, doubts & regrets, and helped me get through a nasty breakup without going back. Every time I felt tempted to call him, I'd read a chapter & be laughing too hard at seeing the ridiculous nature of my relationships boldly outlined with laugh-at-myself-and-heal humor. After a breakup is when I feel the most depressed, taking life way too seriously! This book had me laughing the whole way, or smirking, chuckling, snorting, almost-peed-myself, non-stop, nodding-my-head, giggling. Whenever I'd get upset about a man, I'd read a few pages & it was like seeing the guy naked to the core--and myself too (because we're not so innocent either)! I now have the whole set of books this author has written, the humor is timeless & there will always be breakups or jerks who make my hair stand on end, and this book helps release the pressure of taking life too darn seriously."
4,A slightly uneven book of feminist humor,"Heimel is brilliant. I do love her work. Her essay on ""Clothes and PMS"", included in this book, stands as one of the funniest things I have ever read (""I am a symphony of reds!"" she sings, before she is saved from herself). Her slightly embittered, I-don't-even-want-to-know approach to life rings true.The only place the book sags is when it tries to be too serious. Heimel should stick to comedy. Some people just can't be trusted with biting social commentary. About a third of the book seems to fall within this category. I skipped most of that. But the rest is pure genius, with insight and wit."
5,First Hornblower book,"Forester eventually backtracked and wrote four books set in Hornblower's earlier career. This book introduces two important characters: Lt. Bush and Lady Barbara. Before reading the series I had already read all 20 of the ""Master and Commander"" books by Patrick O'Brian. When I finished that series I never thought I would meet characters as interesting Jack Aubrey or Stephen Maturin. I was wrong. Hornblower, Bush and Lady Barbara keep me asking for more. I am on the 9th book in the series, and I am going to be as depressed as I was when I finish number 11 as I was when I finished O'Brian's 20th."
4,Hornblower series...,"I'm just getting into this genre, and I've seen Forester referenced, and compared, several times. So I decided to read the first written, which I thought was impressive, since it was written in 1938! Now I'm reading the series in chronological order and I'm about halfway....GREAT read(s)! If I had a son, I would encourage him to read them when he was old enough. In THIS age, they convey true integrity, along with true courage...Oh yeah, and true adventure! Not just combat adventure, but how the characters in the political world of the Imperial Navy of the 1800's can appreciate the humility, modesty, and dedication of one of their own.And as many have said before me, the detail is incredible, as if Forester was there. From a former Marine, French Foreign Legionnaire, and Firefighter, do yourself a favor and read them..."
5,Alternate Title,"""Beat to Quarters"" -- also sold under the title ""The Happy Return"" -- is unquestionably one of the best in the series. For the first time, we see a natural, feeling Hornblower, rather than the cardboard hero of the earlier books"
4,"Wonderful re-readable book, but with lots of typos","This book is an old favorite and classic. It's very well worth rereading, so I was delighted to find it available for my Kindle. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is marred by many typographical errors, some obvious like the uncapitalized name ""barbara"" at location 4057. Other errors are probably the result of careless editing of character recognition in the scanned text. They include ""tune"" at location 4065; it should read ""time."" At location 4251, ""write"" whould probably be ""unite."" And at location 4308, perhaps ""produce"" should read ""procure."" There are also several instances of doubled commas, as well as ""hi"" being substituted for ""in."" These problems don't ruin a wonderful book, but the publisher owes us more careful editing, especially for reprinted books with minimal production costs.Beat to Quarters (Hornblower Saga)"
4,very nice sea battles,"c.s. forester is very good at making hornblower both believable and someone we care about. the sea battles are riveting. didn't have much of a plot though, and it's always painful to read the casual racism in novels of this era. the presence of lady wellesley on board for most of the story didn't really add anything, either."
2,Which Came First? The chicken or the egg.,"Forester may have helped create the genre of historical naval novels, but , quite frankly... Patrick O'Brian was the more capable writer. Forester's Hornblower is a cardboard figure compared to O'Brian's Maturin and Aubrey.Perhaps O'Brian's work could be considered ""derivative""... but this would be a good example of the pupil trumping his Master.As light reading, with a fascinating dose of well-researched 19th C. naval history, I think O'Brian is the place to start, despite the ""longevity"" of the Hornblower saga.But.. reading both authors will give you material to form your own opinions about their relative merits."
4,The book against which naval historical fiction is measured.,"The original Hornblower novel. This book started the popular 17th/18th century naval historical fiction trend.Beat to Quarters is the story of British frigate on assignment off the Pacific coast of South America. Forester does an excellent job portraying the roles and responsibilities of a commander on foreign station. The story line is well put together, reads easily and moves quickly.The story concentrates on Captain Hornblower, the commander of the vessel. Many of the details that we currently expect to see in naval historical fiction dealing with ship operation and interaction with the crew are only partially developed. At the time Beat to Quarters was written, there was no assumption of knowledge based on prior reading. There was no other similar reading available!Overall, Beat to Quarters is worth reading both as a classic and because it is a good book."
1,BEWARE,"This is not the novel by CS Forrester. It is a GUIDE. Would sure be nice if AMAZON actually sold the KINDLE digital version of the NOVEL and not this ""accessory"" GUIDE."
5,Beat to Quarters------8th Grader,"Beat to Quarters is a wonderfully written novel. Captivating from the very beginning, they start out at sea so you don't have to get through any boring introduction of the book. Although it has a rather complex plot, with Captain Horatio Hornblower having to deal with his worries about the French and Spanish, the Natividad, and later on El Supremo as well as his newly found feelings for Lady Barbara, it is a very interesting read. It is a good place to start reading the Hornblower series. Although it isn't first in chronological order, it was written first and it does introduce the series quite well."
4,Not bad for a gameboy version,"I purchased this game when I found out that Turok was on gameboy. It's not as good as the N64 version, but it's a pretty good substitute. If you like Turok games and gameboy games, I recommend that you buy this, I'm sure that you will enjoy it."
4,Not big on suspense,"Although I didn't find this book that suspenseful, I did enjoy the story. I really enjoy Ms. McCrumb's writing, and the way she introduces a bit of the supernatural in her stories with her wonderful Nora Bonesteel. I also love the setting high in the Appalachian mountains. It sounds like beautiful country. This is a book that depicts the way small family farms are disappearing throughout North America. It's about a very old mystery, and a modern-day tragedy. It's also about a family of four boys who learn to rediscover themselves when they have to return home to their ailing father. The story is bittersweet, and the legends are wonderful."
3,"Mystical, long-winded, interesting, unbelieveable","This book involves too many factors and is hard to keep straight. It might have been better as a family coming together over the dying father--finding out about themselves and each other. Instead there are ghosts, seers, murder, a long play-acted Daniel Boone scene, long-dead Indians and real estate developers. I liked the book, but she couldn't seem to settle on what it was really about."
1,A Complete Bore,"This book is possibly the most boring novel I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. I am in agreement with another reviewer in that the word ""mystery"" being applied to this book is a stretch. I fancy myself a fan of mysteries, and this one fails in the most elementary of mystery criteria; to keep the reader interested in the story and to provide an element of surprise. The problem here is not that the author didn't endeavor to surprise the reader at the end but that by the end of the book the reader no longer cares about the story, therefore rendering any potential surprises completely lacking in impact. The dialogue between characters is canned, and the characters themselves are cookie-cutter personalities without real depth. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it is fairly quick reading. This allowed me to fulfill my self-imposed obligation to the loved one who gave it to me by finishing it."
5,Good Read,"This is a great book if you can find it. Lots of history. His next book Planet Drum is just a picture book, and a repeat of what was in last book."
5,One of few books about drums and drumming...,"I am a drummer. My main focus of interest is jazz. I am also an avid academic reader. One thing that is obvious is the lack of dedicated books on the subject of drums and drumming, particularly drumming as it is practiced today, in my world.Hart's book is a great read, building on a lot of research. At times, it is rather evident that Hart's band was the Grateful Dead. That kind of ""fuzzy"" logic is the only thing I can hold against this book. And then again, I am not sure I even agree with myself here.Hart's book is a must read for any drummer. It contains Hart's own personal story. But it also contains loads of interesting information on drums and drumming, some of it not easily available anywhere else.The only reason not to get this book is if you cannot find it. Shame on the publishing company for not re-printing it. Pronto. Please..."
2,Traci Smith,"This is a very simple book, and doesn't give any real guidance unless you've never owned any dog before. It's an easy read, but if you're looking for real insight look elsewhere."
3,Let's be fair,"28 Teeth is neither as bad nor as good as it has been made out to be by the other reviewers. Virtually indistinguishable from the legions of ska-punk bands roaming the country at the moment, Buck o Nine nevertheless have some fun moments on this disc (Round Kid, My Town), but for a more pleasing B09 experience, check out Barfly, which ought to be available on TAANG! records, if you can find it."
2,average ska/punk,"Buck-O-Nine is a pretty average ska band. They play a couple catchy songs, but unfortunatly they aren't very talented musicians, and this makes for songs that lack variety. Another problem is the vocalist, who sounds like a frog. Not a big bull frog, or a little one for that matter, but, you know, just one of those average green frogs you see in ponds. If you just heard their single on the radio, I can't blame you for thinking that these guys are the greatest. But believe me, If you take the time to delve a little deeper into the ska and punk scenes, you'll find that most real ska makes this band look pathetic."
3,Not as good as it can be,"This cd is good for those who like light punk, it's sorta repetitive, and it's good if you wanna crank it in the car or put it on for party music, but if you're looking for lyrics with stronger passion, this isn't it. The band should have put a little more effort into their songs. The lyrics are easy and they aren't ""bad"" to those listening around you, I can't say whether you should get it or not, it's like a mutual feeling cd."
4,Great SKA album,"I've listened to lots of ska over the years and I would rate ""My Town"" as one of my top 10 ska songs of all time. It's as catchy a ska tune as they come...ranks right up there with the classics from the English Beat and with more modern stuff like Rancid."
3,Buck o Nine tears [it] up!!,"A great album with lovely chord progressions and good song writing. My only problem: The singer's voice annoys me(Don't take it from me though, I love John Flansburg and John Linnell from They might be giants). See how you like it!"
5,This CD is great!,"This CD has dominated my player. At the very worst a song is merely ok. For any fan of punk or ska this is a cd you MUST have. I also own Libido and Pass the Dutchie, and while they are good they are nothing on this one."
1,"Buy the ""Pass The Dutchie"" EP","Don't buy this CD, its not very good. However, the ""Pass The Dutchie"" EP is great. It contains a great cover of ""Pass The Dutchie"" (different and better than the one on Barfly) and 5 unreleased tracks, including a great remix of ""28 Teeth"". Pass this one up and go for ""Pass The Dutchie""."
2,OK............. at best,"Well, just recently i bought a few cds from amazon and 28 teeth was one of them. At first i was really hyped up about this cd because of the good things i heard about it but once i popped it into the cd player i was dissapointed. I couldn't even listen to the whole cd the first time i tried because it lost me after the first 5 songs. I expected better ska than this, the horn section is not that impressive and the vocals are just terrible. I must admit that on a select few songs the horn section is OK at best but nothing compared to Mustard Plug or the Mad Caddies. What i would do with the $$$ your about to spend on this cd would be to buy a Mad Caddies cd..... now that is a good band! ....."
2,Boring,"I bought this CD at time ago but never really sat down to listen carefully all songs recorded.Based on the title and featured by ""Don Marsh Orchestra"" I was sure that it was played by a real full orchestra like many other CDs under the direction of Don Marsh, which is a great conductor and arranger.On this CD, unfortunately, he made a mistake to use a synthesizer imitating many solo instruments like violin, flute, violoncello, piano, and many other instruments of orchestra. Not only that, the string bass, also synthesizer, is played on a constant and squared rhythm that make our ear tired. I was capable to listening only few tracks of it.For people that like to listen a good and real orchestra like the one from Eden Symphony Orchestra, which I bought lately, this CD from Don Marsh can not get other title better than BORING."
2,Student volume no where near as good as the original book.,"I read the original version when I was in middle school and was delighted to rediscover this book, unfortunately this students volume has been edited, the beginning is cut out and the curse words have been edited out. The original book was very good and is the only one from my youth I want to re-read, but it won't be this student edition."
4,Whats so Great about it?,"This is a great book for people that would like to learn about the history of Florida and someone that's likes books that contains mixed emotions. When you read this book you will feel happy, sad, informed, surprised, and much much more. My favorite part of this book is when the main character Tobias MacIvey's son Zech MacIvey goes to and Indian village to give the Indians a very generous gift and Zech ends up sleeping or laying down with one of the young Indian girls. I also like the part when Tobias MacIvey saves a group of the same Indians form being whipped to death by some mean, selfish, and ruthless cowboys. As I have said before this a great book and I really would recommend anyone who is likes books about life in the old days and cowboys to read this book and you will see what a great book it is. Once reading it I know you will love it and don't worry there is a whole other book that continues the life of Florida called ""A Land Remembered Vol.2"""
5,Just your average '97 rock album!,"I'm just now getting into this cd here in '02 and it reminds me how fun the rock music scene was about 5 years ago. Birdbrain's ""Let's Be Nice"" is as an album full of good, fresh rock music. Anybody bored with the alternative/modern rock scene nowadays, should check out this cd to take yourself back in time to when the music scene consisted of such fresh sounds. Other good albums from back in the day to check out if you like this cd: Lazlo Bane's ""11 Transistor"", Ednaswap's ""Wacko Magneto"", Treble Charger's ""Maybe It's Me"", Huffamoose's ""We've Been Had Again"", and Wank's ""Get A Grip On Yourself"""
4,"Great, unpretentious record!",". . .infinitely more invigorating, articulate, and immediate (no pun intendended) than the critically-lauded junk that seems to clog the pipeline these days, this album is funky, raw, and just TOO MUCH FUN! Ian's a great singer, raspy and full of character, and the songs chug along in the classic Faces/Stones manner. Check it out before it slips out of print!!!!! The other album (""Turn Faces"") is an import version of this album, FYI. . ."
4,Junk Food - excellent,"Junk Food is an excellent choice cd. Personally, my favorite of AC Reed's work. If you are into Blues and enjoy jamming out at home or in the car, I highly recommend this cd."
4,"Works Great, Just don't Dunk it!","This really works as advertised. My wife, for obvious reasons, loves it. The light at night does not hurt your eyes and it teaches my 5-yr old son (and his Dad) proper ""potty etiquette"".I'd give it five stars but since I dropped it in the bowl, it no longer works. It won't fall off on it's own but due to it's proximity to various water sources, I would have liked it to be a little more water-resistant. I will buy another one.Tip: When you pull it off the lid to change the batteries, keep a good grip on it and don't change the batteries over the toilet bowl."
4,Arkon LavNav,Will never search for the light switch in the bathroom which Seniors require. Great product. Just keep a supply of batteries on hand
1,Didn't work right out of the package,didn't live up to its claim. Did not work at all! Can not return because I had it for my new move stored away. When I tried it and waited per the instructions it still did not work!
4,Really cool little light!,"Works just as advertised, has stick on tape on the back already so just peel and stick on the inside of the top cover for comode! Turn off bathroom light and when movement is detected by this little light it turns on showing you that the seat is either up (Red light glows) or down (Green light glows)! Gives off decent amount of light, enough to get you seated or pointed in the right direction! Great little gadget!! Got 3 for all bathrooms in the house!!!"
4,Favorite Christmas gift!,"I got this for all my brothers and sisters for christmas. They were thrilled. I had one of these in my new house, and I no longer need a night light in my bathroom. Although the 2002 version was a bit more expensive, and it had a red bullseye that would aim perfectly in the middle of the toilet bowl. This new model puts a large red circle on the upper edge of the bowl. Regardless everyone seems to like it a lot!"
5,if you wanna see when you go pee in the dark,"this thing is pretty cool, it has a motion sensor on it and will automatically shut off after a while saving the batteries, as well as when you close the lid, we have a teenage boy at home so this comes in handy in the middle of the night"
4,great nite light,It works good really too good . Even on a cloudy day the light activates . So it would be nice if there was a off switch .
4,family favorite,"Bought several of these for fun Christmas stocking stuffers several years ago, and they proved to be a family favorite. We've bought them for every toilet in each of our last 3 homes, for our camp and as housewarming gifts. Especially popular with one mom who has several little boys - they love aiming for the ""target"" light and her cleanup has been reduced! I just like not having to turn on the overhead light in the middle of the night - it can be seen from the bed and would wake my husband who has trouble sleeping."
3,LavNav light was defective,"This light is an excellent light for its lighting properties, however the one I purchased was defective. The red light showing the lid is up, burned out right after we installed the unit. I wouldn't recommend buying one of these units. I will buy another brand next time."
2,Unforgivable,"I have read and actually own nearly all books about the Mau Mau and their struggle. However, this book is the worst..It is an in your face slam dunk by a European male who, by being such will never convince me or any other Aftikan that he is /was nothing other than a CIA agent or a tool of the British.I took this book from the library, and returned it after regurgitating and feeling comfortable enough to know that there is more to this writer and this trash than the eyes read.The very title is a misnomer. Terrorist? If anyone is/was a terrorist it is the European colonizer who has taken every meaningful thing from my mother Afrika, and to date continues the same.Bottom line, the one who enslaved us cannot lead us or overstand that freedom means that is why the author chose the label terrorist vs freedom fighter..Takes one to know one, and i and we are unforgiving."
5,just... perfect,"If you can find a single thing wrong with this cd, please let me know. Because i cant. Perfect in every way, the pure talent, the emotion put forth into it and being felt from it, and damn they can outplay just about anyone. The guitarist's pour out every feeling they have into their playing, and they are unbeatable, rivaling the Dillinger Escape Plan in pure ferocity. The drummer, is mind-blowing, if he even is a human lifeform. There is a certain chaos they bring that i have never heard any band match. Complex composition and time-bending signatures are sewn through-out blast beat sequences and abstract jazzy metal riffs. The lyrics are sincere and passionate though heartbroken, none of this fake forced poetic-ness thrown about in trendy metalcore these days. You wont be seeing them since they are no more, but cherish them by buying this cd."
4,Geezer comes through again,"Geezer makes another good album on his second solo attempt. Clark Brown is the new vocalist on this album and is quite different from Burton Bell, but also does well interpreting Geezer's lyrics. The aggressive/scream singing is gone on this album, but it is still musically good. The opening song, Man in a Suitcase is a great song. I picked this one up in 1997 and it has always been one of my favorites."
4,Absolutely Heavy!,"And the reviewer below who claimed this is ""nu-metal"" has no idea what he's talking about. ""Nu-metal"" is Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, and so on and so forth, of which this sounds NOTHING like. It's sad that that review is posted as the representative ""con"" review. Geezer lays out heavy, loud groove metal. I'd even say a bit of thrash. And I'll second liking this better than Plastic Planet, which was good. Yet it sounds like Fear Factory's vocalist going a bit Sabbath-ish (which was what it was). With the new vocalist, this sounds like a real band."
2,Geezer goes nu-metal.... Unfortunately.,"Well, I was fooled by all the glowing reviews below and, eager to get my hands in anything Sabbath-related, finally found this album in a store and bought it.Don't be fooled: despite all the fancy words, this is nothing more than Geezer going along with the trends and going nu-metal. And, as with almost anything nu-metal, there are no memorable riffs at all. The singer is also pedestrian, his voice has zero individuality. It's jsut a a headache--inducing wall of noise from start to finish.Of course, Geezer is too classy to record a throwaway album, he would never do that. But this one comes close to it."
1,"All Research, No Insight","Tenner gives loads of citations and research but doesnt even have a thesis. He rambles off example of interactions between humanity and its technology. His writing style is poor and will lose you in his trail of thought. He is very bad at describing what he is thinking. He never actually ""says"" anything. All he does is present research.He very rarely, if ever, derives a conclusion from what he brings up. He should not be called a philosopher of everyday technology, because at least in this book, he never actually does any thinking.Very very poor. I would not recommend it at all."
3,Interesting facts - writing too academic,"The book finished more interesting than it began, but overall the book was a disappointment. Many of the topics were interesting - shoes, chairs, music and text keyboards, eye glasses - and occasionally the writing was interesting.Mr. Tenner's style was more academic - many facts and dates and names - but he rarely made any of the people or situations come alive. If he followed that path, the book would have been far more interesting and entertaining. For me, what makes history is not the the facts and figures, but the people and the color of the situation.After reading the book I have many interesting tidbits of information, but unless someone is HIGHLY interested in the history of chairs or one of the topics in the table of contents, I can not recommend they pick up this book. I wish I could."
2,"Good for practice, bad for content review","This book is ok if you only need more practice questions to work on. The book doesn't provide any review of the test topics...no review..at all. Instead, each section has a brief outline that states what you should already know before taking the practice questions. If you need a review for any of the topics, you will need to find another book.The practice questions include 100 verbal, 100 quantitative, 75 biology, 100 chemistry, and 45 reading comprehension questions. There is also a practice test at the end. There are ""explanations"" for each question, but they are much too brief to be helpful, especially for verbal.The first 45 pages cover non-test related topics about preparing for pharmacy as a career & preparing for the schooling. At the very end of the book is a list of accredited pharmacy colleges, which is helpful if you are at a loss of where to apply.In short, it would be a helpful book if you just want a little more practice, but that's about it."
4,good book,used this book in conjunction with topscore PCAT cd. took mcat review a few months prior. but after test felt good and studied alot this book. this book has explainations unlike CD. but it does prepare you. i advise you to get this and the cd. study both alot and you'll do great
1,don't waste your time or money,"If you're looking for a book with a comprehensive review of the topics covered by the PCAT, you're looking in the wrong place! This book might be useful if you simply want question to practice with, but even so, many of the questions are either poorly written or no where near challenging enough to really prep you for the test.I suppose if you're intent on going to U of Tennessee for pharmacy, you could pick this up, because the entire intro is written pretty much specifically for that school.Seriously, if you want a thorough review and a decent practice exam, don't waste your money on this book, just pick up Kaplan's."
2,at least it attracts something,"ivew used a few different bass attractants and this one is the worst, besides mike brand crayfish which only attracts carp lol but this one sucks too save you $$"
2,Doesn't aid Digestion whatsoever.,I didn't buy this for use as a spice like I would think most purchasers have. I bought it to aid my indigestion problems and it didn't do anything for me with that. Fennel seed is usually amazing for that purpose. Perhaps it's good as a spice though I honestly haven't tried.
5,Coast LED Lenser Flashlight,"Excellent flashlight. Bright, powerful, and very handy to have. Small and compact size makes it easy to tote around. Have purchased 5 units already, and given several away to people travelling, or to my mom as a handy light to have in her purse. Would always go with COAST products ~ as they are well made, and very reliable."
2,Poorly constructed,"I bought this special anniversary edition from Amazon for $30.00 and was extremely happy that I found such a pan for this low price. I have 20 pieces of calphalon and 6 of those are commercial nonstick. This piece was horrible. I never use it for high temp cooking and absolutely never use metal utensils, but within 6 mos it was chipping and pitted. I was not going to pay to ship it back to Calphalon when shipping would be a sizeable percentage of the cost of the pan, but I had to stop using it. All-Clad for me now, thanks."
2,great pan - for a while,"We have had this pan for 2 years - and was one of our favorites. We used it very carefully, but the nonstick coating is coming off and we are throwing it away. Very disappointed!"
2,WARNING: NO GARLIC MARINADE!!,"I have used this pan for everything for two years now. ONCE I cook a steak soaked in garlic marinade, and boom, off comes the non-stick in a SQUARE the exact size of the meat!The steak is ruined and so is the pan, which now has a sticky (dupont) coating all over it. They claim at Calphalon that garlic wouldn't have caused it, but I take no chances from now on, and I will be using nothing but stainless wiith garlic marinade.Come on, if it wasn't the marinade, what else could it be?"
1,"12"" Calphalon 12"" non-stick frypan","I purchased a Calphalon model 1392 (look at the bottom of the pan for this info). The pan cooks and the food releases like a dream -- the problem is the handle and the flaw is major. It is small in cross section, has a nasty curve downward and is very ""slick"". The handle stays cool but it makes the pan very difficult (for this in-shape male) to handle, to the point of being dangerous. Too bad they ruined an otherwise outstanding product with such a blunder. So much for testing a new design by the people who designed it. I'm returning it, regretfully. Most of my cookware is Calphalon and I continue to trust the brand -- Ford had an Edsel and I still bought three mustangs.Lou BindnerDenver, CObindlebear@aol.com"
2,Bigger than you think,"We already own the 10"" version of this omelette but we figured ""for the price get it"". The extra 2"" really makes a difference.Nothing sticks to the finish and it is a breeze to wash(by hand!!). And for the person wanting a lid,buy the 8-1/2 qt.Professional Hard-Anodized saucier that is on. The lid fits perfectly and you get world's most versatile pot to boot."
1,To the Gentlemen Who Got Free Shipping from Calphalon,"It's interesting how your story about you getting free shipping contradicts the very policy that Calphalon has written clearly on their site, in the Warranty section.They said very clearly:If you have a warranty claim:If you believe you have a defective product, send the product, freight PRE-PAID, with a letter explaining the defect, to this address:Calphalon Consumer Relations260 Metty Drive, Suite BAnn Arbor, MI 48103Well, sir, do you still doubt they don't pay shipping?????Maybe you're just so sweet that they fell in love with you and took care of you better than their own company's policy would allow??"
1,Very uncomfortable shoe,"These shoes are tight and very difficult to wear all day. If you are buying these, buy them wide. I honestly regret buying them."
5,Skechers Men's Slip-On Oxford,Purchased for a gift. Sharp-looking shoe though. I suspect they could be worn as a dress shoe or with jeans for a night out.
5,"Great book, can't wait for the next in the series","I found this book to be startlingly good, even better than the previous GotM. Steven Erikson has definitely taken epic fantasy to a new level."
3,Unique Subject,"I have never read a book that deals heavily with a 'long march' situation. Coltaine's March is an intellectual triumph, following the revolution in the city, through the epic, horrific journey to safety. It was done incredibly well.Then we get to Felesin's own long march. She and her two odd companions go through hell and back. But she and her companions are such unappealing characters that reading about them is a chore. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, she has this incredible transformation and is now incredible mature, wise and insightful. Clumsy editing, but nowhere near as bad as Gardens of the Moon.It is a good read, but hard to do sometimes."
5,Couldn't put it down.,"I read this book in about two days. It was just an amazing storyline filled with great adventures and clever dialogue. I can't say enough about Steven Erikson, the guy is amazing. Putting out 10 books in less than 10 years? Who else can you say that about? The series is finished. I'm currently reading through Midnight Tides and it has just gotten more interesting as it's gone along. Which is quite a statement because Deadhouse Gates was the clincher for me. Gardens of the Moon could be confusing, where as Deadhouse Gates is just a knock down in your face book! Pick it up, you won't be disappointed! I promise! Come yell at me if you didn't like it, I'm a fan of varied opinions."
3,Disappointing Follow-Up to 'Gardens',"Sadly this book returned to the fantasy morasse that I delightedly found 'Gardens of the Moon' to be free from: static characters and miles and miles of battle scenes. Once I became so bored I started skipping pages without missing the plot I knew I was done with this book. Erickson's worldbuilding and imagination and writing skills are all impressive, but this novel would be twice as good if it was half as long. I hope the next book is as good as 'Gardens' was."
2,Too complicated for the sake of it,"Characters are appealing and overall, the universe could have been great if Steven Erikson was not trying so hard to play to the game ""I will try to get my reader lost by having 100 different characters""...It was recommend by a colleague with A Song of Ice & Fire and if I like the ""A song"" series, this series is not for a reader just trying to enjoy an epic heroic fantasy tale but more for those looking for a brain-damaging experience."
4,Better than Gardens but still short of superb,"4 aspect I will judge this story by, Story, Worldbuilding, Characterization and Emotional response.Story: 3 starsCharacterization:3 starsWorldbuilding:4 starsEmotional response: 4 stars"
2,After two books had enough,"I kept hoping that after two books I would be hooked, but never did. Confusing, rambling plot lines, long periods of the characters doing nothing with very little action. Some of the characters had great potential but the author lost me. A plodding, joyless series that I eventually realized was a waster of time."
4,Love it!,"After reading first book of the series, Gardens of the Moon I was left astonished and eagerly went for 2nd book to get some answers. Not that the first one didn't offer any explanations but it was shrouded with mystery and simply opened questions about the world that I really want to know more about.Deadhouse Gates is great read, simple as that. It's a bit more simplistic then the first one but on the other hand it's a bit more complex since you start to get a feel about how huge the world is. Throughout the book rare are the moments of light and happiness... darkness, sorrow, pain is everywhere.Characters are really well developed, plot is outstanding with all those twists and turns and there are plenty answers to the questions from the first book. After reading it I got the feeling I just scratched the beginning of the great story big enough to be called The Malazan Book of the Fallen ;)"
3,"A nice story, but too distant characters","The story is well written and nicely constructed. But as with the first book, it is hard too identify oneselfs with the characters presented. They stay too distant and almost emotionless in my opinion. It may be that Erikson would've done a better job, if he would have presented less but more developed characters. I don't know if I will continue with the third book."
3,"love the book, but not the kindle version","The actual story I give 5 stars. I love this whole series and cannot recommend it highly enough. But after a re-read with this kindle version, I have to say this ebook version leaves a lot to be desired. There seems to be no editing whatsoever. The typesetting is bad in places. Worse, there are times you have to guess what the words are.Read this book, but get the dead tree version instead of the ebook, at least for your first read through."
3,kindle edition problems,"This Kindle edition of Deadhouse Gates contains many typographical errors. Early in the book, I noticed typographical errors that look like character recognition problems (e.g., substituting I for l). Later in the book, there are many places where several consecutive words are repeated twice in the text. Amazon customer service accepted my report of problems and offered a refund but has been otherwise unhelpful. The book is not unreadable; it is just below the quality that I have come to expect from Kindle editions."
3,Hard read,"I have now read the first two in the series,and because of some reviews I bought the 3rd and will start tonight. I kinda had a hard time following some of the sub plots, all these different gods showing up and having casual conversations was weird, but I will give it one more try because I do like the main storyline."
5,Does Not Disappoint!,"After reading book 1, it was a little disconcerting to start with another new set of characters, though it was nice to have a couple of the old ones. His detailed narration of strategy, war, and his character developments are just incomparable. I've never been so blown away by any other author. I LOVE erikson's writing. His stories each stand apart, and this is the FIRST fantasy writer (other than Tolkien) who's sequel does not in ANY WAY sell the reader short. I bawled my eyes out at the end. It's amazing! His style, writing, and command of a story... breath-taking. There is not praise enough to give for this writer."
2,"Some good, the rest sluggish and/or absurd","I really enjoyed Gardens of the Moon, and had high hopes for Deadhouse Gates. It started out well, very engaging. 1/3 of the way through it starts to bog down, then proceeds to the absurd. It seems around every corner, Erikson is trying to outdo his last description of grisly death. I started rolling my eyes at the predictable ""how much more gruesome can I make the next scene"" and also there's always some new terribly powerful entity to make mincemeat of the latest extremely powerful entity. To the point of absurdity, somewhat laughable.The interminable march of Coltaine's army, I ended up skimming over. Got through the book pretty quickly that way and felt less resentful of having my time wasted. The last straw for me was, one thousand of the cursed crucifixes??? At this point, I'm assuming the reader was supposed to be shocked and saddened, but I was just frustrated. It and other scenes were absurdly excessive."
4,Book purchase,this book was purchased from Amazon. It came on time and was in great condition. I would buy from this seller again
2,My chihuahua won't eat it,"Usually my dog will eat anything you give her, including vegetables and weird fruit but she found no reason to eat these, they don't smell or taste like peanut butter, yes I tasted them myself after she would not eat them, and instead they taste very sour. However I crush them and mix it with real peanut butter and then she will eat it but since I have to put in the extra effort I only gave it two stars."
5,great treat,This product is perfect for dogs who need the glucosamine for joint problems...easy to take in a treat.
1,Sheet Music Only,"I ordered this book, thinking I would find some awesome 2 volume set about Sir Elton John. I was more than disappointed to find out that it is no more than sheet music for most all of his songs. That's it."
5,"Excellent book, a must read for anyone interested in EOD!","Demo Men is a well written and much over-due account of EOD work at its finest. Gary Smiths insight and expertise gained while serving as an member of Det Whidbey undoubtably provided the technical expertise required in editing this book. Demo Men gives the reader a inside look at the life of an EOD tech. As a X- Navy EOD tech myself I can testify to the accuracy of the information in this book, right down to the correct explosive weight of a blasting cap and the time it takes to burn six feet of time fuse. Perhaps the publishers could persuade Mr. Smith to write a book about all Navy EOD."
2,What is the subject?,"""Demo Men"" is a fragmented account of the evolution of the Explosive Ordinance Disposal occupation in the U.S. military. The Intro and Preface are well written and non-biased, but the rest of the book does not live up to this. The accounts compiled and arranged have no order and there is only a slight mention of the Air Force EOD. The worst part of the book comes with the Navy EOD stories that do not cover EOD at all, only underwater operations. The book is about EOD, and there are a few excellent accounts, but it looses control and starts teaching the reader about SCUBA. It does not flow but rather falls off a cliff in its attemt to immortalize EOD."
3,Fun and interesting story. Sarcastic view of the world,The book was a good read and fun. Author made great characters and some great situations and commentary on society. Sometimes it lagged though in moving the story along. Overall I liked reading it but would not call it a must rea
5,What if the Flying Dutchman REALLY existed?,"Jan Vanderdecker is the Flying Dutchman. He has been alivesince 1553. He is not real happy about it. His crew isnot real happy either (one of them keeps trying to killhimself by jumping out of the crows nest ten or 15 times/day).The problem with living so long is that you leave a papertrail. Enter Jane Doland, CPA, who makes her living followingpaper trails. She has discovered that someone still has an openaccount in a bank her CPA firm audits. What follows isthe funniest book I have read in years. The reason everyone infinancial community should be frightened of the Flying Dutchmanis silly. The reason the crew of the Verdomde can only visit landonce every seven years is absurd. The possibility that themembers of the crew could live over 400 years and still beidiots is somewhat disturbing. Humor is rare in the fantasygenre.There were more laughs/pagethan I have seen any any humor book I have read."
2,Not trying to be mean.,"We already have Nirvana. Birdbrain sounds like Nirvana, except the music isn't as good, the vocals aren't as good, and the lyrics aren't as good. Birdbrain pretty much sounds like polished grudge. That in itself is an oxymoron. I found nothing new and/or exciting about this CD."
4,Watch This...,"This watch is certainly a worthwhile timepiece for those who served our Nation in Vietnam--I have the U.S. Army version... the Vietnam ribbon that decorates the watch face is discrete and well-placed so as not to interfere with reading the time. There is a date calendar on the right side which is rather small and hard to read. The band is comfortable; however, what appears in the product photo to be metallic is actually a facade of metal over a plastic wristband. The band gets quite warm on the arm during hot weather, but it is quite hearty and can withstand the normal wear and tear of daily wearing. All in all, for the price paid, a decent watch that can be worn daily."
5,Very enjoyable CD,Greg Page simply has a beautiful voice -- I really like this CD although I am not usually a big country fan. I like the fact that Greg does not have a twang. The TCB band provides excellent instrumentation as well.
4,Time,"Will determine after it has flown outside for a while. It looks good, but being out in the elements will determine if this was a good purchase."
3,The Turquiose,"Not as riviting as other Seton novels I've read, but still worth reading. I love her historical accuracy. Worth reading."
1,The Turquoise,"Wow, this is not nearly as good as her other books. Must have been an early effort or an impending deadline. Give it a miss."
1,Turquoise,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't read this book. The print is entirely to little. Most of the books I've ordered are wonderful and I wish this had been like the others."
2,hidden false teaching,"This book had some very good teaching in the first half. But as I got closer to the end I found it was teaching the ""man-child"" false teaching. I would recommend you know your Bible very well before reading this book. What seems so good at first can turn out to drag you into a very false and dangerous teaching. I combined what I found in this book with what he teaches on his web site and decided to stay away from his ministry. Read your Bibles people! You won't be pulled into false teaching if you do."
5,Don't Turn Down This Rare Find!,A majority of my aunts & uncles grew up in this notrious suburb & they would always tell me how nice Cicero was before I was born and this book brought back a lot of memories for my relatives. The book is all pictures and shows sites of where the Chicago Syndicate used to frequent.
3,An important story- but poorly written,"Not as poignant as Night or as eloquantly descriptive as Approaches to Auschwitz, Schindlers List is as the back cover suggests- a book written for development into a movie. It was interesting to see where Speilberg took liberty. The author himself cautions that certain elements of the book were fictionalized, however this does not detract from the absolute horror the reader is put into. This is perhaps a decent introduction into Holocaust literature, but is by no means conclusive, comprehensive, or in the same league as Weisel or Rubenstein's work."
3,rachel lomurno 8th grade,Schindlers List is a true story of a heroic man who used his fortune to build a camp to pretect Jews fromt he Nazis during WW2. This book is very inspiring with a lot of detail in the characters personalities and in the description of the killings and torture the prisoners had to go through. It wasnt the best book but it was a really good book. One of the most interesting ive read.
4,Enlightening But a Hard Read,"Shindler's list is a very factual account of the tragedy that was carried out by the evilest of evil. However, between the German words that I can't understand and the sentences that run on and on, I personally found this a difficult book to get through."
3,Powerful Propaganda,I just thought that it had a big effect on a lot of people. It seemed like powerful anti-German propaganda designed to make people really hate Germans.A lot of people take it as a true story but it is a fictional story that weaves an illusion before our eyes. Sure Shindler existed but more than half of that stuff is not true. That Steven Spielberg is a tricky illusionist.
1,Schindler's List is NOT non-fiction,"Unfortunately, in the frenzy of media hype people seem to have picked up the strange impression, probably by liars like Spielberg, that this book is an ""amazing true story.""It was originally published as a work of fiction, a story written around someone who really DID exist.worldcat library entry:Schindler's list. *. By: Thomas Keneally ... Subject: Righteous Gentiles in the Holocaust, Fiction., Poland, Kraków, World War"
5,"Interesting, brilliant, exceptional all once","There's some sort of charm and insight to every sentence in Thomas Keneally's exceptional novel. Indeed, Oskar Schindler was a scoundrel, a drunkard, a womanizer (unremittingly successful in all three), but he was refined and had a heart of gold. He was far from flawless, but flawed men are capable of great things. Thomas Keneally doesn't just bring him interestingly to life; he brings the situations to life as well. Sometimes, the novel seems immediate and urgent; other times, it seems sober and indifferent. The observations and keen duality of Keneally telling the story and BEING the story is very curious, and indeed, some of the events are just eye-poppingly coincidental, since many of them actually happened in history. One of the better Holocaust fiction, ""Schindler's List"" is powerful, compelling, brilliant, and exceptional."
4,a great book!,"This was a very good story! Schindler's List was very informative and compelling and suspenseful and overall, a great story to read. This book provides an accurate and detailed account of Schindler and the lives of the people he saved during the war. The author also informs the reader of what happened after the war, to both Schindler and the people he saved. A great book!"
4,Confusing - but good.,"I read Schindler's List for my English class, and I found it an educating and interesting experience for me and my friends, but it was extremely confusing. I found it especially difficult to discern a plot or theme from the book. I digress however, the life and escapades of Oskar Schindler are worth reading about and I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Holocaust or World War II."
3,"Excellent historical treatment, captivating story","I was glued to the pages of SL, but I was hungry for a deeper story that may or may not be born out by the facts. Why did Schindler do what he did, and why didn't he ever do anything of consequence before or after ? If anyone's interested, I'll expand. Jack"
5,Made for TV quality RoboCop,"This is one of a series of 4 RoboCop movies made for TV. The effects / story are a bit sub par compared to the three original movies, but RoboCop fans will enjoy them nonetheless.I heartily recommend these DVDs being a RoboCop fan myself."
5,Seducing Alicia,"Alicia Underwood is a scientist developing a bacteria toreverse the effects of radiation She is a woman without a social life.When the women in her department start talking constantly about the luscious new janitor, Alicia tries not to pay too much attention. But he is definitely paying attention to her, and eventually she can't help responding to him....Tracy Cozzens' characters are well-drawn, especially Alicia and her insecurities and fears. The plot takes several unexpected turns despite the fact that the villain is obvious from the start. Blazing love scenes, sparkling humor, and a startling, pulse-pounding climax make this story complete."
3,Pretty potent,"Kinsella's creative consistency remains intact with Owen's debut. A solo project in the strictest sense, the challenging yet melodically relaxed pace sets most of these acoustic-led forays down a pleasant enough path, though over-enunciates tying the introspective, emo-themed lyricism together. In the disc's pretty short running time most songs sound beautiful and talented, though few remain memorable. We see here many good ideas applied through sporadic moments of inspiration, but often without a compelling backbone to prop up much of Owen's sweeping sentiment."
2,Boring...,"Having listened to bit of this CD here and there before owning it, the music sounded perfect. Soft, whispering vocals, Mike picking his acoustic guitar. Sadly, however, the album is a disappointment. There are some very nice, beautiful moments; however the songs don't hold up after repeated listens. While I love this style of music, Owen can be boring. The music is very repetitive, lacking changes, both tonally and rhythmically. Nick Drake's ""Pink Moon"" or Mark Kozelek's ""What's Next to the Moon"" are more powerful examples of Owen-esque music. Owen feels like another example of (members of) a rock band experimenting with a quieter side (Promise Ring = Vermont, Get Up Kids = New Amsterdams) that, though there are good intentions, just doesn't work as well as it could."
3,Don't let the title fool you...,"A small, somewhat uninspired format that contains many meditations and a small section of Chinese proverbs. It isn't exactly an expansive review of any type of Chinese philosophy, nor will it cure any ills, but it does give a curt lesson in meditation and material to start on. And it travels well."
3,Simple introduction to meditation.,This is a very small and easy to read book. A good introducton to meditation. The book is mainly a small collection of chinese sayings and philosophy. You can read it cover to cover within an hour; but to study the words of wisdom will take a lifetime.
3,its a locking gas cap,"My husband picked these up for our cars (neon & a dodge caravan). Honestly, it drives me nuts. I have a heck of a time closing it properly so my engine light comes on all the time. Maybe its because my chromosomes are XX instead of XY or something, but I HATE putting this thing back on and wish for my old cap :("
1,Non locking cap,I brought this for a dodge ram 1500 for which it was recommended but the dumb thing will not lock. This is definitely a non locking cap.
1,Does not lock!!!!,I got this for my car entered my info and they said it was for my car.. i got it and put it on and the darn thing will not lock!!! if your looking for a non locking gas cap THIS IS IT!!!
2,HIG,"Hello I recieved your product but surprised to learn that its very hard to open I don't know if its your fault maybe I just got a bad one it's very hard to open with key but I'm trying to make dew it's not worth trying to return it I rather just deal with it than to go without it,"
5,Marketed for Bicyclists- Good for many other uses,"Chamois Butt'r Skin Lubricant is marketed to bicylists. However, this is a great product for anyone who needs serious moisturizing. I have a chronic rash on my foot that needs moisturizing several times per day and I generally use Vaseline which is goopy and greasy. Chamois Butt'r is so much better because it is not greasy in the slightest- the texture is creamy and well- I just like it a whole lot better than vaseline. Anyone who has dry, patchy skin or chafing on any part of the body should give this product a try."
4,Does the job well,"I haven't used anything to compare it too, but this does the job very well. Keeps the tender areas well lubricated to cut down on chaffing. It washes off the hands easily after applying. So far I have no complaints."
4,Don't ride without it.,Solid product. If you are serious about riding you will want to use a skin lubricant. Chamois Butt'r is reliable and the Amazon price is fantastic.
4,"A ""must"" product if you cycle a lot",+ Works very well. Easy to apply. Stays on even through long wet rides.- Expensive.
5,Good stuff for Ergomaniacs,"I do a 10K on a Concept II Ergometer (indoor rowing machine) virtually every morning. After about 10 months of this I developed a sore spot from chafing about the size of a quarter on my butt. I found this stuff in a bicycle shop, marketed to bicyclists with a similar problem. Now I smear it on my butt before every workout, and it has worked both as a cure and a preventive measure. I missed nary a workout while my skin healed itself, thanks to Chamois Butt'r. Excellent product. Expensive, but worth every penny."
4,Does the job well,"I bought this cream for a 115-mile charity bike ride that I did a few weeks ago. I was seriously worried about chaffing, especially in the hot weather or if it rained. Well, we rode the first 80 miles in the heat and then it poured and this stuff worked like a charm. No chaffing at all. I gave some to my friends who did the ride with me and they used it too - same good results. And there is a lot in that big tube, so it will last you a long time."
3,OK but there are far superior alternative products,"While Chamois Butt'r is better than nothing, my top picks are DZnuts (or DZbliss for women) and Assos. Both the DZnuts and Assos are far FAR better creams in my experience. I use some sort of cream for rides longer than an hour but your mileage may vary. Ive heard tell that pro racers swear by noxema cream because it works well and is much cheaper (per ounce) than 'designer' cycling creams."
2,Bought thinking I would need,"But my long rides haven't made me need this yet. A bike butt after some time off is something everyone gets, but if you are a steady rider, probably won't need this."
2,Not worth your money,"It is a very good concept, but flawed in its execution. The transmitter works ok as long as the PSP is disconnected from the power and there aren't too many competing stations close by. Apparently there isn't enough shielding material between the power and the FM antenna, when the PSP is plugged to both a high pitch whine can be heard at all times over the three selectable frequencies. Even when the power is disconnected there is a very low hum in the background, but at least this one can be ignored.Also watch for similar products combining power and transmitter from the other companies as they may be the same rebranded product."
4,"his best work around, for now","an uneven but fascinating work.still it's worth the price and maybe it's the best Holdsworth you can find on cd right now.anyway, look for his 1983 Warner Bros. album, Road Games, should anyone have it reprinted: that's is his best work ever."
5,A Classic,"Closer to prog-rock [that's right Chip, you wanker {see above}]than jazz fusion, ""Metal Fatigue"" is one of the best CDs you will ever buy. If you are tired of the same old thing order this now!"
2,Bad pump design,"After only a few months of infrequent use (once or twice per month), the tabs that hold down the pump handle broke off from the pressure in the tank. The tabs are designed to hold down the pump handle when it is not being used to pressurize the tank, but the tank pressure puts pressure on the tabs and they break off easily. Very disappointing, as I was expecting to get many years of service. Parts are difficult and expensive to get from manufacturer. I will buy a different sprayer next time."
4,A Must Buy for Dealing with Shelter Cats,The information contained on this video is valuable. Although the 90's production style is dated the information is not. This video is especially valuable for people with shy or difficult to handle cats. There is a feature towards the end that is really informative for anyone dealing with shelter cats. In using this technique I've turned our very skiddish and shy cat into a total love. Before using the Ttouch she would hide and coward and now she confidentlly roles on her back and lets me Ttouch her belly. Thank you Linda Tellington-Jones for this amazing knowledge.
5,AMAZING!,"Sevendust's self titled album is by far one of the best heavy metal cd's I've ever heard. Of course Sevendust as a group is an amazing bunch of guys. From Lajon on vocals to the heavy guitar riffs and unique percussion, you'll never want to turn this cd off. And if you like this cd their second album ""Home"" is even better. And if by chance you are lucky enough to have these boys come through you town on tour...make sure to check them out. The energy you feel from them at there concerts is like nothing you've ever experienced."
5,Simply Where Hard-Core-Melody Began.,"Beautiful masterpiece in musical history. The kind of cd which defines a generation. In your face for its time, cleverly crafted to mix chorus and breakdown riffs... quite unique"
5,sevendust in the begining,"With their self-titled album, Sevendust delivers a powerful a really powerful album that should have gotten way more attention then it did. Of course with their sound, it can be difficult to get radio and MTV attention but after the album went gold and getting a lot of praise you would figure that it would."
5,Top notch metal with real passion and style,"From their roots as Crawlspace practicing at the Wreck Room in Atlanta, this band has matured and become one of the hottest and most talked about metal bands to come on the scene in years.Start with searing lead vocals, and in an incredibly heavy and tight drum and bass interaction, and then throw in a dual-edged sonic guitar assualt, and you have one of the strongest metal bands I have heard since Stuck Mojo and Rage Against The Machine first came on the scene back in the early nineties.To see them know touring around the world with metal heavyweight Ozzy Osbourne and gaining fans at every show, it makes me proud to have seen them at their start back in the glory days to the Wreck Room (since closed after being sacrificed to the greed of the Olympics).This album is a must have for any fan of solid, straight ahead metal. If you enjoy Tool, Limp Bizkit, Korn, or Rage Against the Machine, you will seriously enjoy Sevendust."
1,weak,"I can't belive so many people gave this five stars. W.T.F.? This is the worst CD I've ever bought. And this is coming from someone who loves heavy music (Korn, Sepultura, Tool, Fear Factory). This is pure FLUFF!!"
3,Don't be Fooled,"I recently bought this album after hearing the remarkable live cut ""Black"" on The Hard and The Heavy compilation. I have been searching for some heavy music to replace the space once reserved for future Metallica releases. After seeing the new release S&M (""Sellout and Money""), I new I must look elsewhere for raw tunes. While I was not disappointed in the non-live version of Black, that song is not representative of the overwrought, painful almalgam of musical styles that Sevendust creates. I just wanted to warn any individuals who may be about to purchase the CD based on that cut alone,as I did, to listen to more elsewhere before purchase, you may be left with a new skeet target if you do not."
1,YIPPIE ANOTHER CORN SOUND ALIKE,another corn sound alike band thats all we need .they talent and they aint heavy metal listen to bands like jungle rot or exhumed
1,Ugh,"This is a terrible CD. Childish lyrics sung by an awful voice combined with barely mediocre instrumentals make this album a waste of time and money. Though it can be good for a luagh every so often. I recomend you buy more sophisticated music like NIN, Ministry, or KMFDM.P.S. Industrial fans be warned: contrary to what amazon says this album is NOT industrial. I don't know what the hell it is."
1,sevindust,"Say what you will,this is not anything when compaired to the real masters of Metal...Sabbath! You can try and try but the truth of the matter is that its all been done by the best there ever be,I give it a star for effort.Not because it was all that great. Heads up to Slayer ,Metalica and Sabbath...The best there ever be.If you want a real good Metal band try Iron maiden,you wont be let down or early JP.such as Stainded glass or Brit/steal."
4,awesome,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS CD I WAS AMAZED!SEVENDUST HAS BECOME ONE OF MY FAVE BANDS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.AND IF YOU GET A CHANCE SEE TNEM LIVE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.BLACK IS AWESOME,AND WIRED IS GOOD AS WELL.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM"
5,The Best Sounding music,Sevendust is the best band!! I love the band and the sound of there music!! They know how to rock!
4,Sevendust used to be called Crawlspace,"This is a good cd, i prefer it to ""Home"". For the guy that wrote that review a couple reviews below this: Sevendust used to be called Crawlspace, but another band had that name copyrighted and they changed it right before their s/t album came out"
2,Corrosion of Conformity or Flotsam?????,I dont know about this one. It sounds like Corrosion of Conformity and/or Flotsam and Jetsam. Musically it will survive *barely* on the radio. but It has that dullness to it.
3,BASIC,"I like these guys, I really do. I think they are really good but come on! it's some basic sh*t. In wired the instruments don't even play at the same time. guitars are really good, but the talent could of been better used. I agree with the other person who said fluff. It's weak. For some heavey stuff go with the big boys in rock(old korn,tool, old manson etc. they are hard) but this is probably good if you are into more lighter stuff."
4,Heavy S**t,"This CD is good and some of the songs really kick A$$ (Black), but still, no one is as good as KoRn. Sevendust is almost, but not quite, there."
3,JUST ANOTHER KORN WANNABE!,"Of course this recording is going to be descent, I feel like I've heard it a hundred times before! This is just another band plagiarizing a sound that has been made popular by bands like White Zombie and Korn ( True innovators). Skip this disc and go for the real deal!"
5,"Tough as nails, it doesn't get any harder...any better","Built Ford-tough, these Atlanta boys are down for a new generation of HARD rockers, this album is the new standard by which heavy records will be measured in the millenium."
5,Pretty Da*n good,"I once borrowed from a friend and could never get it, i am glad i finally did. This one is a cd you must have in your collection."
5,Awesome!!!!,"All I can say is bravo to Sevendust!! Every song was complete in every way...it is the perfect energy boosting album to get. From the songs ""Bitch,"" ""Black,"" and ""Prayer"" you can see and feel the emotions from the band. From the CD to the stage, Sevendust kicks ass!!"
5,sevendust,this is a great cd i lesion to it every day i highly recamend buy this cd if your a sevendust fan they are awesome and the live show is the best i have ever seen and i have been to a lot of concerts so buy with easy its a great cd
5,SevenDust is the greatest,"I like Korn & Limp Bizkit, but all they do is talk & scream. They never sing. Lajon Witherspoon is probaly the best Metal *Singer* by far!!!"
5,Future of metal?,This could be the direction metal is headed. Singing and metal mixed with riffs and beats hard as Pantera. They show a wide range from Speak to Wired to Bitch to Pray. They show that metal can have melody and cover a wide range of topics in the lyrics without being dubbed alternative. An incredible CD
2,Sevendust truly sucks,"Okay, guys, I'm a metal fan, but this CD really sucks. All the songs sound the same, and they really aren't that talented. Better save your money for something better. This was a waste of my time."
2,This is a really choppy album!,"I am not at all pleased with this album their are only 2 songs on this album worth listening to, well, really just one all the guitars are so choppy as I would call it no solid beats at all. AT ALL COSTS AVOID THIS ONE!"
3,Sounds like it was recorded in a restroom.,"The cd isn't bad, but it's not great. I like home better because of the guitar play and much better equipment used. Home sounds very clear, while this cd sounds like it was recorded in a bowling alley restroom. I give it 3 stars, had they improved the sound quality, i'd give it a 3.5. Get Home before you get this album. Both albums sound very different. And if you like Home, get this album also, it's a good value."
3,Good,"If you use the disposible bottles, this is a pretty good set to have.If you are like me and use the reusable bottles, get some sealing disks for the 4oz bottles. It eases the frustration of using the bags and works really well if you use the Avent Isis Breast Pump."
2,Give me a break!,"As a Vietnamese-American, I want to learn more about preparing and cooking Vietnamese cuisines. Along with Mai Pham's ""Pleasures of the Vietnamese Table,"" I bought this book because of its beautiful images of Vietnamese food. These images evoke childhood memories.As soon as I finished skimming through the book, I was quite devastated that I didn't recognize anything as Vietnamese cuisines. All these recipes are practically French, New Age, or fusion hosh-posh. Yes! I am a purist when it comes to international cuisines.Furthermore, the recipes are so difficult to follow. It seems that Mr. Read is so obessesive over the glossy photos that he forgets include complete instructions.I donated the book to the local public library."
1,What a travesty,I am usually wary when westerners write Vietnamese cookbooks and this book is the reason why. Get Mai Pham's book if you're looking for Vietnamese food. I don't know what this stuff is.
4,Bue? Not really,"Replaced my '06 Wrangler's stock headlights with these. The ""Cool Blue"" is misleading, no blue appearance, but the difference is substantial. These bulbs provide a much brighter and whiter light than stock bulbs. An economical improvement much needed."
2,Noise from the bowels of....,"Good Lord this album is grungy and feedback infested! If that's your bag you should love it. Me, I can't even listen to it the whole way through. Nothing like Sabbath or Ozzy except for it's LOUD..."
3,This is the best book of the trilogy.,"Although flawed in the same ways as the other two books, The Silver Hand stands slightly above its siblings. There is relatively little of the modern world invading this title. Instead, the focus is firmly on the Otherworld, the setting which is the meat of this series.Even though it is slightly better than the rest of the series, it is probably not worth picking up. Its contents would not be particularly intelligible without slogging through the other two books."
2,Just OK,"I'd love it if they'd make a full vocal score of Chicago, because these tracks (not only on this but the Broadway version too) are not so great.Much of the trumpets and brass sounds like MIDI files, although the orchestrations of I Cant Do It Alone sound very close to the ones on the cast album.To Kander-Ebb, the music publishing people, ANYONE who has anything to do with Chicago: please make a vocal score so we can hear good music instead of this very electronic work."
2,Last 4 tracks don't work,I love this CD except for the fact that the last 4 tracks don't work. The words are all jumbled up on the graphics and the audio skips and stops. Completely un-useable !!!
2,Order a larger size,"These shoes were very pretty, however I had to return them because they were too tight. So if you order, order at least a half size up."
3,I shoud have asked about the copywrite...,my copy was an old one-so naturally it was pretty much useless.
3,Did not get the same item i ordered,"I ordered this movie for my aunt who likes King Clave. Well, the DVD i got contained two movies in one DVD which may reduced the quality of the movies. I did not realize that until my aunt told me that it contained two movies in one DVD."
5,This is a best buy item,"I had been looking at local shops to buy a spice grinder. Low and behold amazon.com has a much better deal & it comes with a pollen press! fantastic! I've had this for a couple months & it works great and make grinding a breeze. I have found that if you tip it over with spice inside the middle chamber it will build up in the cracks which can be a bit of a sticky mess, pretty sure that's common for spice grinders. This package deal made my spring even better!"
5,great grinder,"works great couldn't beat it for the price, i enjoy having a pollen screen, and crusher to make pucks with"
4,Good Deal,This seems to be a good grinder and a better press. The grinder should be CNC Aluminum then it would be great. Screen is pretty fine but easily replaced. It's made like a Diamond Grind just a little less quality metal and not 50 bucks like it's top contender. The press is well made I put it to work right away it's just a little smaller than I expected. I would recomend these items if you are looking to save $$$
1,AVOID!!,"THIS BRAND IS RUBBISH. WORKED WELL FIRST TWO TIMES 3RD TIME JAMMED, AND NOW IT CONSTANTLY IS DIFFICULT TO TURN AND GRIND EVEN GETS STUCK IM GUESSING REVIEWS ARE FROM SELLERS I FEEL CONNED WITH THIS ITEM BEST TO STICK TO SPACE CASE WHO MAKE THEIRS OUT OF ASINGLE BLOCK OF ALLOY MAKING SURE PRECISION AND SMOOTH TURNING IS THERE SHAME ABOUT THE PRICE :-(. DONT GET THIS GRINDER NO1 IS BETTER!"
5,Fantastic!,"My brother in law has a Santa Cruz Shredder, and after using it I wanted a grinder of my own. However, the $80 price tag for the Shredder was a little out of my budget. So I got this baby. This thing is GREAT! I tested it out and I loaded it up with some pretty dense ""roseMARY"" buds and it took a little effort on the first turn then after that it was smooth sailing. It came with a really cool pollen press to turn your pollen into a solid. It also came with a little scraper! :D This product is top notch. BUY IT!"
5,Space Case,Shipped quickly ... Great combo package of a grinder and a pollen presser- will do business again in near future
4,Great experience,Great experience buying these shoes for my boyfriend.....he loved them and they arrived extremely fast. Thanks will do business again.
2,Looks good but . . .,"This is a fine looking shoe, seemingly well designed from the picture. In fact, it is stiff, narrow, insubstantial, and uncomfrotable. There's nothing much to the sole, including comfort."
3,"good boot, but...","Pro: good styling, looks good even with nicer casual clothes, very durable upper and tread, fully waterproofCon: VERY hard inner sole. Even with good replacement footbeds, harder and less confortable than other hiking shoes and boots I have owned."
4,Boots for Christmas gift.,"The boots are great, but found them for less money at the mall after I received them in the mail."
4,A comprehensive overview,"The guide includes a brief description of more than 1,000 public sites and tells the reader where to get more detailed--and usually free--information. For a book of this size (600 pages) and modest price, it is an excellent starting point for the traveler. To include everything else (maps, prices for accommodations, etc.) the book would have to be several times its size and price."
4,IT IS WHAT I NEED,"HAVING TWO KNEE REPLACEMENTS AND SPINE SURGERY, MY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS LIMITED. I DO HAVE ACCESS TO A GYM AND DO LOW IMPACT STEPPING AND AT HOME WHILE WATCHING TV AND SITTING TALKING ON PHONE, I CAN PEDAL. THE PEDAL EXERCISER IS SIMPLE IN CONSTRUCTION, LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO PUT OUT OF SIGHT WHEN NEED BE."
4,So close to perfection!,"I wanted this bag for a purse. Ultimately I found it was too small. But this is not really a problem since Timbuk2 makes the same bag in Medium. Well, the problem is that the zipper gussets are very wide in order to close the bag, and when the zipper is open and the gussets flap down into the bag, they cover up the openings to all the interior pockets. So then you have to hold the gussets up and out of the bag with one hand while fishing around inside for the thing you want. Too much hassle. But in every other way these Timbuk2 bags are great."
3,Just okay,"From the photo, I thought this tote would:a) Stand upright on its ownb) Hold more stuffIt doesn't do either. So, it's a bag for holding a couple of things. I don't find it worth the price, but I'm too lazy to return it."
3,it was ok...,"This book did a great job describing xhtml,and like most special edition books I really liked. It was easy to understand. However, they didn't do the best describing modularization. I understood it more when I read it on w3.org. It also should've gone a bit further. I was especially disappointed it didn't say anything about xforms which was like the coolest part of xhtml. That doesn't this book isn't worth the money though. Its a great reference, but if you're looking to harness the full potential of xhtml and its newer features go elsewhere."
3,Willing to Sell,"I rarely read this; however, it is practical and a decent resource, as well as an easy read. I'm willing to part with it if anyone is interested in purchasing the book. Otherwise, I may donate it to the public library."
3,Alright book for basic reference.,"This book was a great reference guide for me who already knows HTML/XHTML, but might not be good for the beginner."
2,Very difficult to program,"This is overpriced and very difficult to program. Also check your state law to see whether you can remove meds from original container when traveling-in my state (Maine) you can't. There are less complicated, more durable pill box timers out there."
5,Great book!,"I love how many craft ideas are in here! I must learn how to knit now, but I can't wait to do these projects with my children."
4,Good for Younger Children,"We bought this to reinforce the children's understanding of geography. It was not as fun for for my 8 year old but we have driven across the US three times and she knows all of the State capitals and States by site (shape). The Great States game is more fun for her. But it was great for my 5 year old (boy). If your kids are new to US geography then this would be a fun way for them to learn States, Capitals, crops, etc."
3,Not as Fun as we expected...,"The quality of the game is very good. Nice colors and very sturdy cardboard. As far as fun factor goes I would only give it 3 stars because after a little bit it became quite boring for us. Also, I would like to add that the instructions are not quite so clear as to how to play when an industry is called for a state and maybe Milk is produced in more than one state then who gets the card? The one who calls it first or must you also have the matching state. It was a bit confusing so we ended up making our own rules. It is an okay game, I don't see us playing it too much. As far as an educational game for learning states, I personally prefer Scrambled States much better."
2,Disappointing,"David Fincher's Seven was undoubtadly one of the most unnerving mainstream films of recent memory, and after hearing the great, moody music from the film, I tracked down the soundtrack and was very disappointed. First off, Howard Shore's orchestral scores are more than worth hearing and capture the depressed feel of the film, but the remix of ""Closer"" by Nine Inch Nails (which played during the opening credits) and David Bowie's ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"" (which played during the closing credits) are not present here, which is very disheartening. Gravity Kills' one time hit ""Guilty"" is here, but other than that there isn't anything else worth hearing. If your a fan of the film and love the two songs I listed above, this is what to do. For the remix of ""Closer"" is available on the ""Closer to God"" CD single, and Bowie's song can be found on his ""Outside"" album. If your looking to buy this soundtrack for one or both those songs, beware, they are not here."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I love all of the music in the film SE7EN. However, the soundtrack pissed me off. Three very cool songs are missing: Nine Inch Nails-Closer [Precursor], David Bowie-The Hearts Filthy Lesson, and Ren Klyce/Steve Boddecker-Lust. I would have killed for these to be on the soundtrack, but that would never happen. I give it a three-star because I like all of the music, but I wanted so much more.If anyone can find ""Lust"" for me on MP3 or CD, PLEASE E-MAIL ME!!!!!"
3,"Forget this soundtrack, get the score","While this soundtrack has some worthy songs (especially the Bach piece and the suite), it is completely lacking in actual music from the film. Anyone who has seen this great film knows that it has a great score by Howard Shore. Do yourself a favor, skip this one and go for the score disc, it contains 28 tracks and is running for almost an hour and a half. It contains every piece of score in the film and this is the REAL soundtrack. It's called ""Se7en - The Expanded Soundtrack"". Unfortunately it is very rare, I seriously doubt if you can find it in a retail shop and I know for a fact that no online shop sells it. I got it from a friend a couple of years ago and it has been one of my most valuable soundtracks to date. Do yourself some good and go look for this one, it's the soundtrack as it was meant to be."
1,WHY NO OPENING TITLES!,"I was planning to buy this soundtrack, but when I found that the openning titles weren't on it, I changed my mind.Take a hint record producers and re-release the CD with the missing songs"
1,wtf,"What idiot put together this soundtrack? It doesn't have the key songs. The mood setting songs. The good songs. How can you leave Closer or Heart's Filthy Less off this soundtrack? This sounds more like one from a sappy ass chick flick rather than a psychological thriller. Instead of NIN or David Bowie the put in Billie Holiday and Marvin Gaye. That just screams serial killer. Not saying anything bad about them, but they wouldn't be my first choice to put on the soundtrack this should have been. It's really pathetic."
2,I thought it was good until...,"Yeah it's a great soundtrack, so why are half the tracks from the film missing. Nine Inch Nails (Opening Titles)and the end track (Closing Titles) are both missing from what would otherwise be a great Soundtrack."
2,Music have not the movie feeling,"Music is good but when i listen to this songs don't remind me the movie. Only the Bach Suite.This tracks could be used for a romantic comedy, a 007 movie or other. There's not a relation movie-music. I think the movie is so dark in comparison with this sweet melodies."
1,Yet another rehash of Commission E,"How many times is this author going to publish the same book? Sure there's some new information--new in the sense it wasn't in his other books, but already dated compared to the science--and there are some new products--not a complete list by any means. But, please, once was enough!"
1,Eeeeeeeeee!,"First we had the COMPLETE German Commission E Monographs. Then it was the EXPANDED (Completer?) German Commission E Monographs. Now it's the Completest German Commission E Monographs, I suppose. If you've read one, you've pretty much read them all. Save your money, get any of the guides by Murray & Pizzorno. At least they aren't limited to 29 herbs. I'm returning my copy of this book."
3,not bad,"I took a flier on this flick and found it to be watchable. Although it plays like a ""Lifetime"" movie, I found myself actually interested in the story. No nudity or explicit violence were negatives for me."
4,This was a Gift,"Length:: 0:25 MinsI got this as a gift.It's cute and I found a place on the wall for it.It would be a nice gift for fishermen and outdoorsmen.In this clip, ""Billy"" sings one of his songs."
5,A Funny Piece Of Nostalgia,"If you want something that will at first shock your friends, then make them laugh, then the Big Mouth Billy Bass is for you. I had this years ago, bought from a local Cracker Barrel, and after my first one was damaged, I didn't see another one for years. I found it again recently on Amazon, and it's just as funny and entertaining now as it was then. The best way to get your friends is to hang it up somewhere they go, and turn on the motion sensor. It'll start up on its own. I tried it with my neighbors, and as soon as it started flapping its tail they jumped a mile! This is a great product, and simple to operate."
2,"Does not work as advertised, with no response from provider","This item was purchased as a ""gag"" gift for a colleague's going away party. Unfortunately, although the package was received in good condition, without signs of stress, with proper packaging and no signs of prior opening, there was no sound when operated. The fish was supposed to move, head and tail, in to music. Whether battery operated or with the included plug-in power source, the fish only moved. It would have been hilarious at the dinner, since the recipient was a hobby fishermen. Tool late to return it, since the individual was moving overseas in days, the defective product was a big aggravation. A separate email was sent to JMarcos Co alerting them to the problem, without a reply. The message was not emotional, just simple and factual. A response of apology would have been nice. An offer to offset some of the the total expenditure would have been appropriate. Buyer beware."
4,FUNNY. SONGS STICK WITH YOU,"I would never buy this for a child. It is a fun thing to buy as a gift for a fisherman. We have owned oned for many years, and weren't even sure if they were still around. Our nephew (40+) got a big kick out of it."
5,Good basic came for those of us who don't have time to spend hours flipping through a book to learn,"This is the game at its basic level, which for those of us of an older generation can appreciate. No time on your hands to spend days learning from a guide how to play a game? Well, this version is great. Just start the program and your off. Unlike many of the games today, Civilization reaches back to the times when we didn't need much to be able to pick up the idea of a game. Anyone could play. Unfortunately, this is a much overlooked niche in today's market. Look beyond the graphics to the very basic game play and this is a 5 star.Graphics are an extra frill, not the foundation of a game. I think more of todays games designers should take that little fact into account."
5,"Bugs, bugs, bugs","For a while, I'd wanted to read a good overview of the insect world. After searching for a newer book, I finally came across Richard ConniffSpineless Wonders: Strange Tales from the Invertebrate World, which fit the bill. Conniff's goal is to show that invertebrates are as amazing than most of the charismatic megafauna we all know and love. In fact, many of these bugs are even more incredible, with complex chemical tricks and the ability to undertake great physical leaps and bounds (relative to their size of course). Conniff's writing style is very easy to read and the book is intended for a wider audience (I suspect it might bore more initiated readers). I was disappointed that a few major bugs were not included in the book, particularly Scorpions, but I guess the book had to cut something out. Overall, a fun read and good beginning book if you are curious about the insect world."
2,Just a bit odd,"We got this to help our son with his night fears and other anxieties, but my son himself asked me to not read it. He said it was boring and it bothered him."
4,4 YEAR OLD WILL LISTEN TO IT ON HER OWN!!!,Great relaxation she enjoys all 4 storys and uses them on her own for a sleep aid if she cannot fall asleep for naps or bedtime.
1,happy hands at home,"I was very disappointed in this book. It's seems more like someone's personal craft project at home, the writing was a little boring and the illustrations were so elementary. Each page on the right is a color of the rainbow with white text. When you get to the yellow page you barely can make anything of the text out because of the little contrast. I want to ask did anyone edit or review a proof of this book before it went to print. It really seemed like a happy hands at home project."
4,A Boy and a Turtle - Very good Relaxation Book,"I bought this book based upon my 7 year old son having a lot of anxiety issues with school related issues. I read this book to him the first night, and I have not been able to put it down since. EVERY night around bedtime he asks me to read him his relaxation book. He goes through the motions of closing his eyes, and really trying to relax. After about 1 week of reading it to him, he can start relaxing on his own."
3,A Bit Too Therapeutic?,"I am not particularly fond of this book right now, though I purchased it to give to my 3 and 1/2 year old grandson, along with a cute stuffed turtle I purchased for him, thinking it would be a great book to accompany the toy. Since my grandson is not in need of ""relaxation"" any more than the average 3 and 1/2 year old child, I found the book to be too therapeutic-sounding and am not giving it to him as planned. I will keep it, though, just in case.... and who knows? In this crazy world of ours, he may just need this book in his future. Glad that others found it good for their kids. I hadn't realized how many troubled children there are out there at such tender ages."
1,Complete waste of money,"I am a therapist for children between the ages of 4 and 20. While the book was colorful and the idea was creative, it has received a consistently poor response from children and adults alike. I like that the story is short and succinct, but it is my opinion that the potential fell far short. Upon reading, two individuals felt like the strongest message they came away with were homosexual undertones with the setting, use of the rainbow, and the connection between the turtle and the boy. Regardless, the message flopped, doesn't warrant even one star in my opinion, as a children's therapist."
4,She cannot write a dull book!,"This is the first Agatha Christie book I've read that was NOT a mystery. I was not sure if I would enjoy it but I did! One of the reviews said ""it is impossible for Christie to write a dull book"" and I now agree with that statement.Reading this is like entering another world. I never gave a thought to what an archaeological dig would be like, but now I have a very good idea. I'm sure that this book is dated and things have changed by now, but I really felt like I was a part of the time and place Christie and her husband occupied. I'd just love the chance to meet them now!"
3,Interesting,I bought this for my parents and they really enjoyed reading it. It is so different from other Agatha Christie books.
3,"Wry and dry (humor, that is)","A nice retro insight into realities of earlier 20th-century desert expeditions in northern Mesopotamia with Christie's archaeologist-husband Max Mallowan. She walks the line of her physical and psychological limits (teetering from one side to the other), and ridicules the menagerie of backward locals, but gives credit where credit is due for remarkable physical and mental feats by the indigenes. You have to like someone who credits herself with finally closing an overpacked suitcase by dint of personal ""avoir du pois"", applied by sitting!"
4,"Good book, but not for beginners","This is a good book with excellent plans and drawings, but it assumes you have a background in construction. It doesn't include much background info such as basic techniques and tools. It does have plans and material lists for 15 different structures. I consider this to be an excellent book to be used in conjunction with other books. If you want more ""how-to"" info, go with ""Building Backyard Structures"" by Levine, Begnal & Thornton."
2,Not greatly helpful,"Sylvia Rimm has some interesting and apt characterizations of underachieving students.However, we tried many of her techniques -- with a child who is a staunch perfectionist who thinks that all grades less than perfection are the same -- it's all or nothing -- and the techniques did not bring us success.I would attribute the lack of success to Dr. Rimm's seeming lack of understanding of boys. She doesn't address fully the issues that boys face in competitive academic environments.Be careful with this book. It promised more than it delivered with us."
5,Just get it.,My only regret is having read it so fast. This is Sedaris's funniest book to date - I laughed until my face hurt.
4,Sedaris satisfies - again,Sedaris is the PG Wodehouse of our era it's not about plot twists and impossible fantasies but regular people in slightly weird situations. This is classic Sedaris humor making you laugh uncontrollably in public. Or smile like a fool when you read something that seems to have taken from your life too. There is a bit too much of his France and French adventures but maybe others would relate to it better.
3,I'm very surprised at the adoration here,"Barrel Fever was a masterpiece, Naked was great; this one's awfully thin. Feels like he pumped it out to make a due date, frankly ..."
3,He write better book one day!?!,"Normally I write fairly long reviews, but for this book it's pretty simple, so I'll keep it short. David Sedaris is at times very funny (the scene where he and his classmates attempt to explain Easter in French to a Muslim from Morocco is absolutely hilarious), but at other times it's like he's straining too hard, or maybe he just ran out of good material. In one case he LITERALLY resorts to toilet humor (his desperate efforts to flush someone else's giant turd down the drain) for a cheap laugh. Overall, if you want some really funny moments, interspersed by long stretches of -- at best -- mild amusement, then buy this book. If not, don't, and instead wait until David Sedaris ""write better book one day!"""
2,"Funny, but wears out welcome ......","I had heard several of David Sedaris' hilarious NPR reports which prompted me to buy this book. David's writing is very funny, but I got tired of him pretty fast when reading this book. His self-absorbed personality can really get grating after awhile. He's like the funny guest that turns obnoxious after a couple hours and you wish would just go home...."
5,i laughed until my sister smacked me...,"and then when i read to her what i was laughing at, she laughed right along with me.these essays are pure genius. sedaris really knows how to put his thoughts together and not once did i say ""what the hell is he talking about??""although a few of the bits might be sad to some, thankfully i have the dark sarcastic humor that sedaris requires of his readers.he is one of my idols.the essays are different yet tie in together perfectly."
5,loved every second of it,I could not put this book down....This is the only book I have ever read where I found myself actually calling friends and family members to read them portions of the book. This book was laugh out loud HILLARIOUS! I am telling everyone I know to read this book so I can continue to laugh about it and so they can enjoy it as much as I did!
5,Read It!,"David Sedaris is the only author that makes me laugh until I have tears streaming down my face. Out of all his books, I enjoyed this one the most. After ""Me Talk Pretty..."", I had to read everything he has written, I am obsessive like that."
4,Laughed Out Loud...light and very entertaining.,"When my friend lent me this book, I really needed some light reading. Returning from a week long trip of taking care of a terminally ill family member, getting bronchitis, and the trade center bombing, I needed some humor on my plane ride back home. Being sick, extremely tired, and nervous, I found myself laughing out loud on the plane, to the point where I thought the people around me might think I was going nuts...I finally had to confess the book was so funny.David Sedaris has a great way of picking out the small things in our lives and making them very funny. They are endearing, I very much enjoyed this book."
1,Most depressing book I've ever read,"I feel so bad for the author because there is not one thing in his life that is worth living for. He hates everything and everyone, and he makes that crystal clear with every word he set to paper. His descriptions are bad...some border on cruel and evil. His ""humor"" is directed towards 5 year olds or the brain-damaged. I don't know how this book ever got published."
1,Me Talk Pretty One Day,"This is the first review that I've ever written. However, I am so distrubed about the content of this book, I am compelled to respond. There is nothing humorous about this book. I find it rather distrubing and disgusting. Sick might be a better discription. It is a biographical story, fictious or other, of a very disfunctional individual. If you desire to go into the bowels of the . . . . go ahead. I ain't gonna go there ever again."
1,I'm giving this to someone I don't like!,"Read the reviews. Bought a copy. What a stupid book. Terribly disappointing. I don't agree that Sedaris's humor is ""dark."" It's nonexistent. Clever? Witty? Nah! Who in their right mind would want to read an essay about someone's disgusting trip to the bathroom? Well, I do know one fellow.."
3,Relaxation and a Good Read,"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a quick and easy read that is best taken in small bites. Sedaris' style lends itself to quick reading, but that doesn't mean you should necessarily read the entire book in one sitting. The best short bites the book has to offer are the first essay about Sedaris' speech impediment and the essays in the back which deal with his adjustment to France and his attempt to learn French. Feel free to skip the essays about his brief life as an artist and as a teacher. They are both unsettling in that they make one pity the author, and they are not as entertaining as they could be."
4,Very Funny Collection,"Me Talk Pretty One Day is not your run-of-the-mill memoir or collection of short stories. Not by a long shot. David Sedaris' biting wit will have you laughing out loud by page one. Whether it's the struggles of a boy with a lisp in speech therapy class, the absurdity of a college instructor assigning soap operas for homework or the irreverent descriptions of an uncooperative bowel movement, Sedaris' caustic prose leaves you with painfully-aching sides. Don't read this book in public if you're afraid to be seen--and heard--cracking up. And don't be surprised if between laughs you find yourself learning about life and appreciating the author's insights.Salmon Run"
3,I'd Give it 3.5 Stars if I Could,"I was surprised that this book wasn't as funny as I'd hoped/thought/expected it to be. I often find myself laughing hysterically to Sedaris' NPR stints, so I found it odd that I found the book more ""odd"" than funny. I do have to give credit to one chapter in particular though...""Jesus Shaves."" This is one of the funniest chapters I've EVER read. I'm sure the folks around me on the subway thought I was possessed as I was shaking, trying to control the tears and laughter. If only the rest of the book was as sharp...."
4,Pretty funny,"Gets quite a chuckle out of me - occasionally I come across a paragraph in his book that I don't expect, and just tears me up laughing!"
2,Erratic,"Although I found moments in Sedaris' book laugh-out-loud funny and appreciated some of his more trenchant observations, I felt the book lost its momentum halfway through. From that point on, it seemed contrived, overextended and (in terms of humor) sophomoric.In the end, this didn't turn out to be a book I would recommend."
3,Stories that stay with you,"Me Talk Pretty One Dayby David Sedaris is a collection of his personal essays and my first experience with this genre or type of work. I found them, in general, to be thoroughly enjoyable. The author's style conjures a comfortable and friendly tone that is flavored with a sly wit which is sure to put a slim grin on the reader's face. Passages about his childhood and family are entirely relatable, often hilarious, and Sedaris' discourse on the state of the Cineplex and movie watching in America makes me long for the more intimate experiences of the movie houses that he describes. Not the most cohesive of collections, as his topics are wide-ranging, but the essay ""Youth In Asia"" still makes me laugh every time I think about it."
5,WHAT FUN!,"I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS GUY. WHAT A TWISTED, HYSTERICAL TAKE HE HAS ON EVERYDAY OCCURENCES. I HAVE ENJOYED ALL HIS BOOK AND Me Talk Pretty One Day LIVED UP TO MY GREAT EXPECTATIONS. IT DELIVERED LAUGH-OUT-LOAD GEMS IN EACH AND EVERY CHAPTER. THE EXAMPLES GIVEN FOR A PEOPLE MAGAZINE CROSSWORD PUZZLE...HIS PATRIOTIC PRIDE IN EXPLAINING JODY FOSTER'S ""PACKAGE""......IN THE WORDS OF MRS. SEINFELD: HOW COULD ANYONE NOT LIKE HIM? WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?"
4,Get the audio,"I got this book after hearing Sedaris on 'This American Life.' I would laugh out loud at the radio. Sedaris delivers his sarcasm in such a way that reading it one might miss it. However, I still enjoyed the book, perhaps because I could hear his voice in my head.Sedaris shows how a simple story can be turned into a beautiful form as he explores the tiny moments many of us just ignore in search of excitement. He takes a reader from absurdly silly to poignantly melancholy.Dry sarcasm is his main staple. If you don't like your humor as dry as a three-day-old martini this isn't for you."
5,"Hate to do it, but...","I normally don't make snap judgements or broad statements. Normally, I am a ""live and let live"" kind of person, able to understand and consider vast differences of opinion. That being said, in this case, anyone who didn't almost wet themselves laughing at this book is either dumb, or completely lacking a sense of humor. I've never laughed so hard at anything in my life. I lent a copy to someone at work, and never got it back. Usually, when that happens with a book or a CD, I let it go. Not this time. I went right out and bought another copy. This is a Desert Island book, as in ""pick three things to have with you on a Desert Island, and only three things.""I can't understand anyone who doesn't think this book is genius. You might as well speak another language."
2,Disappointed,"After a 3 year wait since Naked, it's a bit of a letdown that this book is made largely of material that has been printed elsewhere. After being such a fan I suppose it's my own fault for having sought out his various articles in anticipation of a new book. But so much recycled material is disappointing, better for a paperback perhaps. There are some very good laughs and expected Sedaris worldview, but the tone is disjointed, rushed- it's magazine writing on deadline basically. Descriptions of life in Paris and 22 -city book tours (like a rock star) are also not likely to appeal to readers who enjoyed his hilarious depictions of life in the working classes. He seems to be above it all, moved on from crude America, and the work is far less engaging for it."
2,Not As Good As Naked,"I would have given his book ""Naked"" four stars, because the stories were well written and funny. This collection, however, left a lot to be desired. Attempts to attain a level of profundity fell far short, and I think the author realized this because he threw in a fart joke (or something of the like) every time in a shameless attempt to distract the reader from the mediocrity. It is a tragedy that many good writers have to self publish their work and struggle to get it read by a handful of people while works like this win awards. I give it two stars because of the story of the American in France who listens to a group of people talk about him in French while he sits and understands every word. That scene was handled with grace...then came the fart joke."
3,Mild amusement only,"David Sidaris' ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" is the literary equivalent of Wonder Bread: fluffy, popular, palatable perhaps, but in the end unfulfilling. Without question, Sedaris has a curious family and background; his sense of humor (such as it is) is understandable both as to its origins and its indispensability. What is surprising is that this persona , sounding so much like the voice of a bright freshman who's found his way into a narrative lit class, is actually coming from a middle-aged boomer. A literary guise? Some irony-building device? Well, having seen the author on late night recently, I think not. This is the man, a timid milquetoast befuddled by much of the adult world. Paging Walter Mitty....This book is a mildly amusing diversion of a man whose stunted vision shrinks before large ideas, diverse cultures, and experiences beyond his own deafening self-absorption. I was expecting much more."
4,He Write Good Now,"Sedaris, the reluctant francophile, has written another succinct and funny volume of vignettes. It's a delightful, though slim, read."
5,a book for people watchers,"David Sedaris' book is very entertaining - particularly if you find people in general and Americans in particular, amusing.I really enjoyed his sections about his brother and sister. While I agree the section that is about when he was addicted to crytal meth is a bit tedious for those of us who can't relate (The 12 steps to being an artist), I must say reviewer ""Nemisis"" didn't seem to comprehend Sedaris' point that he is NOT an artist and only thought he was because he was on drugs. I also think reviewer ""Nemisis"" must be homophobe with no sense of humor!"
2,"Occasionally funny, but mostly boring","I bought this book because of the many rave reviews even on the book cover itself. I was greatly disappointed. It is funny in places but mostly sad. It is the story of a mostly dysfunctional person and his family: his overbearing father, cigarette smoking and alcoholic mother, and talented but uninterested siblings. Some parts are just pathetic as when Sedaris uses drugs. My suggestion is to read a library copy first and then buy his books if you find them worth the money."
2,Amusing and not so amusing,"The sales of this book are impressive. That is one criterion of book success. And considering the lugubrious books on various best seller lists, some comic relief might be in order. Does it make this reviewer laugh? Parts of it he finds amusing. Other parts,- to take the name of the Lord and to mix it with the vain language of the current time is a part of the book that was not amusing."
2,me talk pretty someday,"This new collection of real-life accounts of the life and times of David Sedaris was an amazing bore. If there ever was an example of the Emperor's New Clothes, me talk pretty, tops the list, evidenced by the heights it has scaled on the best-seller list. Clearly a book need not have any true quality to achieve best-seller status but just clever marketing and previous reputation. Unlike the wacky but fascinating, self-depricating Naked, me talk pretty is a collection of stories one might over hear and tune out during a morning commute. If I were Mr.Sedaris, and thank goodness I am not, I'd be more than embarassed. In fact, me talk pretty is the kind of book that, in better circumstances, Sedaris himself would have used his sharp wit to make fun of."
2,Didn't live up to the rave...,"I bought this book when multiple people in a pseudo-book-club I was in remarked that it was ""the funniest thing they'd ever read."" I have loved humorous books in the past, ranging from political Al-Franken-type books to goofy sci-fi Douglas-Adams-type books. I did not love this book. It simply was not that funny. Sedaris is not that witty or clever, and he's a pretty sub-par writer. I have no interest in reading his other books, but I suppose he could care less, since he's already sold bajillions."
4,Funny,I read this book based on the recommendation of a friend and enjoyed it tremendously. What an admirable trait it is to be able to laugh at one's self. Sedaris even managed to shed some worldly insight with this autobiographical piece. Very well written and funny. I particularly enjoyed his experience with the Americans and the train ride in Paris. I had a similar experience and reading about it was brought back great memories and laughter. This is my first read by Sedaris but I'm sure it won't be the last. Relax and enjoy it.
3,Nothing spectacular,"I purchased this book because I am a fan of Christopher Moore (Fluke, Lamb, Practical Demonkeeping, etc.) and a friend who also enjoys CM recommended David Sedaris. Well, the Me Talk Pretty One Day is adequately entertaining, but nothing spectacular. If you are a fan of light humor, or are interested in reading from the perspective of a gay man who doesn't make his homosexuality the focus of every short story, you might enjoy Me Talk Pretty One Day."
2,Meh,"Yes, this book is undeniably funny. However, it's the literary equivalent of Doritos (ie: Pretty good, but lacking substance. And too much will make you feel vaguely ill.) Borrow it and bust a gut laughing for an afternoon. But don't spend your own money on it, because the vignettes become increasingly less humorous with successive re-readings."
1,Me make stuff up one day,Two scenarios:1. I'm a friend of yours. One day I call you on the phone and tell you about something really funny that happened to me yesterday. Its one of the funniest stories you've ever heard. You totally crack up.2. I'm a friend of yours. One day I call you on the phone and tell you about something really funny that happened to me yesterday. Its one of the funniest stories you've ever heard. You totally crack up. Then I tell you that I made about half of it up. Just to make it funnier.Scenario 1= pretty good friend.Scenario 2= slightly desperate and pathetic attempt at humor. Comes off a bit needy.
1,Huge disappointment. This book is awful.,"I was disappointed and embarassed. I had given this book as a Christmas present last year to a member of my family because I read so many glowing reviews about it being funny and that the author is a modern-day Mark Twain. But I hadn't yet read it. Yesterday I saw it in the airport bookstore and bought my own copy, anticipating a fun read for the next seven hours. It wasn't fun and it isn't funny. It's like eating chewing gum off the sidewalk -- something novel, but not something you want to have inside your body. I'm embarassed that I gave it as a gift and I am writing an apology letter; they must think I regard them as boorish, gross, and unfunnily sarcastic people. Don't waste your time."
1,gross doesn't equal funny,"This book has been described as acerbic, witty, and funny. I beg to differ. While parts of the book certainly live up to this billing, almost every anecdote is marred by something jarringly crude or gross. Perhaps is helps make the point? But it really ruined the book for me. For example the image of a nude man being painfully stomped by a woman(?) in spike heals is about as funny as school shootings or people being dragged to death."
1,Very depressing book,"There was nothing to laugh about in this book. The author made it clear he had a terrible life, that he hated everything and everyone, and that he has felt unloved throughout his life. I found the book to be depressing, irritating and frustrating."
1,Not so much,Dont see what the big deal is. This guy is only moderately funny at best. There were two chapters that even elicited a chuckle. His sister Amy is much funnier. Dont waste your time with David.
2,just an ok book,"Well, for me it wasn't funny at all( maybe because I'm from a foreing country and I don't get American humor all the time) and most of the topics are basic and some of the stories a little annoying. Just an OK book!."
3,"Meh, I was kind of expecting more....","After listening to everyone raving about this book for years, I finally broke down and bought myself a copy. It's entertaining but after all the reviews of everyone saying how hilarious this book is, I expected to be rolling on the floor laughing with tears in my eyes from the hilarity. For a book that starts off with 5 pages of glowing reviews of how ridiculously funny this book is, I was expecting more than an occasional snicker. There were lots of parts where you might say to yourself, ""Oh, thats funny"", but you don't actually laugh out loud. Not a terrible read, but not exactly what I'd call a side splitter. But, thats just me."
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"After all the amazing reviews I heard about this book, I maybe laughed out loud twice. I didn't find anything cutting edge about his humor, it was predictable and often downright boring."
5,"Wonderful writing, fun to read","I couldn't wait to read this book every night when I went to bed. Great writing, love the sarcastic humor, unique observations on life - just a lot of fun."
3,Funny!,"""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" is a very humorous book about the author's different encounters, from growing up, to well..thinking he's grown up. It's a journey through his brain, and you dont have to read it all at once, it's the kind of book you can skip chapters and still understand it. A couple of the chapters are a little boring, but most of them are very funny."
2,Disappointed,"I have read a few of David Sedaris' other books and thought they were simply hysterical. However, ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" is not like those other books. Although some lines were worthy of a small smile, I thought the book failed to entertain. Overall, I was disappointed with the purchase. Next time, I will just borrow the book from a friend before I waste more of my money."
2,Different,This is not a typical read for me. I'm reading this for my book club. I'm 30% thru don't know if I make the end. This book was a read for my book club. Think it should be a mans read.
4,"Funny, Classic Sedaris Sense of Humor","This is the second David Sedaris book I've read, afterNaked. Like that book, this one is full of classic Sedaris stories - funny, touching, and always self-deprecating. We follow Sedaris through all types of adventures - how does he get himself into these situations? Overall, a great beach read for anyone looking for a light and fun read.For Sedaris fans, I highly recommend Wade Rouse'sIt's All Relative: Two Families, Three Dogs, 34 Holidays, and 50 Boxes of Wine (A Memoir). The similarities in their writing are many, as both are unabashedly gay humorists / memoirists."
4,"A Funny, Interesting Guy","Me Talk Pretty vaguely takes the form of a non-chronological autobiography so I'll call it a memoir. This book is meant for fun and laughs, and if there is a deeper level it is in getting to know David Sedaris as a person. This isn't quite so easy because of the ways Sedaris recounts some stages of his life. The grim ones in particular, like his time as a tweaker, takes the idea of show not tell a little too far. Sedaris never mentions his feelings about important and grave events, but of light ones. He escaped all his perils and aimless stages in life to finally be a successful author - but he writes as if somewhere deep down, he always saw this future coming - he was always in on the joke, and was living a crazy life for a while in order to have plenty of stories to tell. This kept Sedaris at a distance from me. Certainly its his choice to do so, but this is the first memoir I've read that wants it to be this way."
5,This book makes me laugh so hard that I cried.,"Hands down - one of the funniest things ever written. Do yourself the favor, you're worth it. If purchased new, this could be the best ten dollars that you have ever spent."
2,scratched,This was the first time I have ever bought a book on CD. I usually just check them out from the library. The CD's look brand new but the story skips quite a bit. I will not buy a book on CD again. I will buy the regular book because I heard the book itself was fantastic.
2,Let down,The first chapters were hilarious! The book quickly became annoying after that... The author teeters between self pity and self indulgence to the point where it's just sickening. I found myself reading more in hopes that it would pick up and become cute and funny again like the beginning of the book was... But I'm over half way through now and I'm bored and have no interest in finishing it. I'm disappointed.
4,LOL funny,"David Sedaris is in usual form in this great collection of short stories that loosely assembled tell the tale of his life from adolesence to adulthood. ""You Can't Kill the Rooster"" hit so close to home, I couldn't decide if I was more shocked or amused by his rendition. Sedaris' self-deprecating writing style is so sardonic, yet so amusing; it's almost scary to think of someone with that low-self esteem level might be capable of if he used his power for evil instead channeling it all into a creative writing outlet. At any rate, he is capable of spinning an entertaining tale - even in situations where most of us would not see the humor."
5,David Sedaris delivers,By far the funniest novel I have ever enjoyed. Sedaris turns our everyday occurrences into side-splitting laughter. I remember reading this book in a quiet setting and by time I was a chapter in people around me were staring because I could not contain myself. Sedaris delivers comedy in a simplistic style. Buy this book! You will not be disappointed.
1,bad sense of humor?,It's simply a long-haul airplane book. I quite did not understand the eulogies from other readers.
2,just okay,"Too sarcastic for me! Hearing him read it was worse. He does sound like a little whimpy girl. Some parts were hillarious, but overall I didn't like it and wouldn't recommend it as a book club discussion book, or for the squeamish."
4,Pure Pleasure,"Me Talk Pretty One Day is David Sedaris' very funny look at himself through both his family and his time in France. The good news that his sister's comedy, Strangers with Candy, is coming out on DVD made me pick this book up again and remember all over what a truly Talented Family this is (and Amy's appearances in David's essays are amongst the funniest sections, outside of the David learning French, of course). These essays seem fresh on second and third helpings. Since the first time I read this I have finally heard many of them on NPR and now can read them with the author's rather distinctive voice in my head. Now my brain is, sadly, changing all commerical jingles into rather nasally, high-pitched Billie Holliday-emoting songs. That may not be a blessing but this book is and will always be."
3,"Good, not great","Love David Sedaris, but this effort isn't as consistently funny as his previous pieces. At times he tends to go off on these self-indulgent tangents that I found pretty boring. Overall I still think he's genius."
2,"Uhh, why the hype?","This is a compilation of about 200 Andy Rooney-esque 60 Minutes essays, just that Andy Rooney is funnier and more interesting.There is no story here, just the author ranting and raving about his life, which to me, doesn't make a book interesting or enjoyable. I didn't know this book would be like this going into it.I can complain about my own life. Why should we care about Sedarris complaining about his? Amusing, but once you are done, it will leave you mind forever.Everyone else loved it, just not me."
2,Unless you enjoy essays....don't read this,"The book is compromised of a series of essays about his life but I didn't think David Sedaris got his point across in this book. Or if he did, it flew right over my head. The stories were cute and funny but not at all moving like I was told they would be. A book that would be enjoyed by those that enjoy a book filled with short stories/essays."
3,Mediocre at best,"I read this book because it was our book club pick. Memoirs (or ""me-mores"") are not my genre choice, but I went into it with an open mind. I found Sedaris to be a skilled writer, but I think he told us more than we wanted to know about his sexual proclivities and drug use. I think it takes some courage to subject one's life and one's dysfunctional family to readers' scrutiny, but I very soon tired of his repetitive antecdotes. The members of our book club who had seen him in person or heard him on NPR were much more enthralled than those of us who ""got to know him"" through his writing. After reading the book, I would never see him in person and certainly wouldn't read another book by him. There are too many good books to waste my time with this author."
1,So Not Funny,"I ordered this book, as well as ""Naked"" because they were recommended for people who enjoyed David Egger's ""Heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius."" I am not sure who decides on those recommendations, but boy were they wrong. I was unable to finish either Sedaris book, as they were boring, bland and just plain unfunny. Egger's book was introspective, fresh, and drew the reader in and made you care about what happened next, not to mention hilariously funny at times. Both of Sedaris' books do little to make you interested in the characters at all and the humor they try to employ wasn't funny when the same jokes were made ten times before Sedaris made them. If you enjoy comedy like recent years of SNL, then maybe you'll like this book. But if you find that kind of humor boring and redundant, then don't waste your money (like I did)."
1,I must be missing something...,"My book club chose this book for our upcoming selection. A friend in the club and I have come to the same conclusion: we cannot finish this book. We have both read chapter after chapter, waiting for the book to be other than mildly amusing and somewhat boring, but we never got to any part that hooked us into the book. The author seems to think he is hilarious, in a rather self-consious manner, and his whole tone seems to proclaim, ""aren't I just so clever""; apparently many people agree with him. I seemed to miss everyone's boat here, because I found the book so boring that I could not go on anymore."
2,Not my Style,"This just isn't my preferred reading. I read alot of genres this just doesn't float my boat. I couldn't get past chapter 4. I never put down books always finish, however, this would have been pointless to finish as there was no ending."
3,"Occasionally funny but mostly just, you know, lame","I don't know what it was, but through the whole book I couldn't shake the feeling that David Sedaris has no soul. Perhaps that is unfair; but it is not unfair to say his book is a soulless, vapid, trite, tired collection of essays with lame titles like ""The Youth in Asia."" Har har. I feel like every decent joke was something I'd heard or read somewhere else. No one's suing Sedaris for plagiarism? Where's the justice? I gave this three stars mostly because it was such a quick read that there wasn't enough time for me to get annoyed with it. I think I laughed a couple times. Not terrible for 272 pages."
5,Me Like Sedaris,"Funny, charming, and heartwarming. I laughed. I cried. It was better than Cats. Sedaris has been around and these stories are testament to the freakish family members and miserable jobs that are part of his life. I was cautioned by one trustworthy book-loaning friend of mine, ""It's just not that funny. He's not the same in print as on NPR."" Well I say, ""To hell with that."" The stories aren't all pee-in-your-pants-laugh-till-you-cry funny, but they do make me smile.Furthermore, Sedaris has a knack for setting a mood, even though it's mostly his own mood that we share. Buy it. Read it. I told you so."
4,pleasant surprise,"I knew nothing of Sedaris when I picked this one up, it justlooked interesting. I laughed out loud from cover to cover.The New York stories nearly killed me, and the tangents hisimagination rides off on are scarily familiar and hilarious.One of the best books I've read in a long time. Sherman Alexie's work got me interested in the short story arena, and Sedaris showed me another side of it that was equally enticing.I promptly went out and read his other works and am looking forward to more."
5,A new height of humor,"""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" is simply the funniest book I have ever read. This auto-biographical look into the ironic and vigorously funny anecdotes of Sedaris's life offer the reader a bizzare sense of hope, and an invitation to take life less seriously. These are stories that make you cry with laughter and beg to be read aloud to friends. I can't imagine that David Sedaris is for everyone, however. This is not a book that I would gift to my grandparents or in-laws, but for an adventurous fun person with a decent sense of humor, ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" will certainly become a favorite."
3,Best in small doses,"I love David Sedaris on ""This American Life,"" but this book doesn't come up to quite the same standard. Sedaris's skewed version of deadpan is incredibly funny in small doses, but ironic self-involvement can wear a little thin over the length of a book. Also, the stories lose something on the page, compared to the radio. When you're listening to Sedaris's voice, the whole experience seems more intimate, as if you were listening to a friend. You lose that sense when you simply read his words, and sometimes you end up feeling, ""Why is this guy telling me all this?"""
3,Decent,Good short stories from a talented writer. Only a few stories in the book were true page turners. I enjoyed the book for what it was but wouldn't read another book from Sedaris. He may be a best-seller but for me he doesn't quite fit.
5,Try it on Audio Tape,"I commute 2.5 hours on a regular basis, and buy books on tape to keep myself awake and amused. David Sedaris' book was one of the best I've ever listened to. The book is recorded by Sedaris, and his voice is perfect for the readings. (As it should be, but authors are not always the best readers). As other reviewers have noted, this book is hilarious, as well as occasionally touching and sad. (Really). If you have a reason to listen to audio tapes, get this one. And if you don't, make a reason."
5,Hysterical!,"The best of all of his books, by far! If you've ever lived (not just visited) in a country where you were still learning the language or ever tried to learn French, you will thoroughly relate to Mr. Sedaris and his trials in France! It's absolutely hysterical!"
2,Disappointing On Several Counts,"I bought this book because I wanted to get an overview of contemporary Paris and the title came up when I searched for something on that subject. Reading this to learn about Paris is like reading War and Peace to learn about military uniforms. There isn't much and what there is is trivial at best. Beyond that, Sedaris is a Dave Barry wannabe with anecdotes that may stimulate laughter in conversation but usually ""clunk"" in writing. His chapter about his brother ""Rooster"" who has a twenty word vocabulary, almost entirely profane, is painful, even to this six year army veteran from a ""line"" company."
1,Disappointing and poorly written,"Some authors are able to write humorous 'autobiographical' novels that really capture the attention. David Sedaris does NOT fall into that category. Me Talk Pretty One Day is more like the inane ramblings of a 12 year old than the work of a supposed comic genius.The first half of the book seems utterly pointless, badly thought through and amateurishly written - there is probably good material here, although Sedanis falls victim of his own misplaced self-belief that he is a writer, with purile observations that are badly structured and poorly conveyed.Interestingly, the second half of the book improves immeasurably, written far more wittily and in a much more mature and thougtfully amusing style ... although he's still not a ""comic genius"" as the back cover would lead us to believe."
2,Thoroughly Un-Funny,"I picked this book up at the airport, seeing as my only other alternatives were One Minute Millionare and the Da Vinci Code. 10 minutes into the book, I wished I had opted for one of the other two, as they may have brought me *some* satisfaction, however brief. Sedaris' book is neither: a) funny; b) irreverent or penetrating, as the heavy marketing of both his books implies; nor c) well-written. Its rather disconcerting that the book is full of such rave reviews from established publications. The guy at the Wall Street Journal who said it was the funniest thing he ever read seriously needs to get out (and read) more."
5,Funny.,"Dave Sedaris is a consistently funny writer and this book is about his really wierd misadventures. His dry wit seems to make even the most mundane stuff exciting. If you like audiobooks, get that instead of the paperback because its read by the author and his dismal voice makes it more personal."
5,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"This lay around my house in college and I assumed, from the cover and the title, that it was some textbook for my roommate's special education coursework. I had no interest in it as a result. How wrong I was! I read the first chapter and it was so hilarious that I stole the book from her to finish in as few sittings as possible.Sedaris has a unique talent for taking the mundane, the average, even the tragic and twisting it up in his special way to make the reader laugh out loud. I've given this book as a gift to many people, and they all have loved it and looked into Sedaris's other works."
4,"""A quiet, sneaky sort of humor...an easy read""","Many will know Sedaris from his hilarious autobiographical commentaries on NPR, especially during his time spent living in Paris. His books are equally funny with such a quiet, sneaky sort of humor and self-referential sarcasm that you can't help but like the guy. From his childhood lisp to being an American in Paris, the anecdotes of his life will literally have you in stitches. One of the funniest people alive. An easy read presented in episodes, good for traveling or the beach."
5,Hilarious...you don't want it to end!,"Listening to David Sedaris's voice narrating 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is a danger if you are behind the wheel! In his voice you can hear the tough (yet funny) times at school & the Speech Pathologist, with his dad and the Music Teacher. Sometimes it's almost too much to listen to!Sedaris's voice is very similar to his sister Amy Sedaris who was Jerry Blank in the cult show 'Strangers with Candy.' They share the same brand of humor: dry, cynical, witty.This is one you certainly don't want to miss and I would suggest the audio version for more personalization (and laughs)."
2,"wanted to love it, but its not for me","The series of short stories left me never truly invested in the main character (which i understand is the author). I heard so many great things, and while I found myself laughing out loud on a few occasions, I think it was overhyped before I even read it, so my expectations were most likely unrealistic. He is a great writer, using interesting examples to illustrate this stories, but because I never felt invested in the character, I struggled to have any reason to keep reading. If any of his other books are not written in short story format i'd like to give that a try."
3,Some love it- just isn't for me.,"I had high expectations for this book since it has recieved good ratings, and also reccomended by A. Burroughs fans, but I wasn't impressed with it. I found some partsboring, and even annoying. I did laugh out loud a few times too, but the overall feel of the book was not realistic to me, and that's what I expected."
3,"Interesting, but not all it's 'cracked up' to be","I bought this book because it is supposed to be really funny. I did find a few portions of the book humorous (although, it wasn't exactly sidesplitting laughter) I found myself a little disappointed. I thought the book was interesting because it kept my attention, and I can't really say it was dull, just not as spectacular as some of the reviewers have said. I do however, think that humor is very subjective, some people will love this book, and others will not be very impressed. It's going to come down to what tickles your funny bone, and unfortunately, this book didn't tickle mine."
2,"Disappointing compared to ""Naked""","With his latest book I got the distinct impression that David Sedaris had run out of amusing episodes in his own past to write about other than a few things that were clearly from the bottom of the barrel. So a lot of the book is written about experiences he has had since becoming a well known writer and there is a ""gosh aren't I unique in my way of life and attitude"" aspect to these that just isn't endearing in the way that his self view from Naked and Barrel Fever were. A good part of the attempted humor is his restructuring into English of conversations he and others had in the process of learning French. Funny for the first paragraph, but gets old quickly because it is such a blatantly manipulative humorous device.Coming to this book alone I would have given it 3 stars, but having enjoyed Naked and Barrel Fever so much, points off for disappointment in light of high expectations. . ."
3,"Disappointed, unfortunately","The hype has been huge for this book and all I have been hearing lately is how wonderfully funny Sedaris's book is. One or two people even told me it was better than Augusten Burroughs' stuff. This of course, got me very interested and I hurried out to buy the book.As much as I was desperate to love it, I was unfortunately disappointed. Don't get me wrong. There are some funny stories, and there is no doubt that Sedaris is witty and comically twisted, but he doesn't hold a candle to Burroughs...not even close. In honesty, I am not sure why so many people compare the two.The truth is, Sedaris is just a little too mild for me. I would never dissuade anyone from reading his material, I would simply say that for those who like dark and twisted humor, Augusten Burroughs is your man. Sedaris is the appetizer."
3,Sedaris goes off to France and gets writer's block (?),"True to his other works, 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is a collection of short stories chronicling various moments in his life. However unlike his other books, most of 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' does not involve members of his family but rather focuses on his life in France. Yes, the author struggles somewhat with the French people and, especially, the French language. But unfortunately these stories, while not exactly boring, are too predictable to be really funny. Somehow Dave Sedaris battling Dave Sedaris in France is not as interesting as adolescent Dave Sedaris fighting adolescence and his delightfully dysfunctional family. And so I hope the author recalls or invents more stories involving his family, or I suggest he retire young and keep studying French.Bottom line: David Sedaris deviates from his proven theme, must to the disappointment of this reader. Not recommended."
4,Howlingly funny...just the thing to take to the dr.'s office,"I was first introduced to the writing of David Sedaris in a Literary Nonfiction class. The excerpt we read was the one from which the title of this book is taken, ""Me Talk Pretty One Day."" I thought it was pretty funny and bought the book. Well, it is a lot funnier than that. The funniest parts of this book deal with his various looney family members, and Sedaris' deadpan style reminds me of Dave Barry with an edge. I took this book to read in the doctor's office while my husband had his colonoscopy and I think the people in the waiting room thought I was certifiable...Several times I had to wipe the tears from my eyes. Highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great comic read."
5,Best David Sedaris,Sedaris' descriptions of those talking in a foreign language are dead-on. I'm reading it for the third time and still laughing out loud at something on every page.
3,Meh...,"I was enjoying the book in the beginning, when David was dealing with his lisp and all. Sedaris is a very witty writer and I appreciate that. However, by the middle of the book I was losing interest. The character became less witty and more irritating as he progressed through adulthood in Paris. He led a life so sad, even Sedaris failed at putting an interesting spin on it."
2,Not really that funny...,"This book is really, honestly not as funny as the reviews make it sound. It an ok read, not boring by any means but definitely not great either... i was disappointed after the bookstore helper raved about it. just an fyi."
2,I just don't get it - sorry,"Ok, to be fair, it really is a matter of just ""I can't relate to this material"". The book is written as a series of autobiographical stories are disjointed and largely interesting. I read the reviews about ""laugh out loud"" - I may have snickered in five places, but I didn't find anything that was worthy of laughing. All I kept thinking is that I have waaaay better material for this kind of a memoir; but really, maybe he's funny to some. Me...not so much."
3,Moderately Successful Comedy Routine,"This book is like one of those comedians you see on TV that you think is funny enough to channel squat around, but you don't remember a single joke s/he told in a week. The routine is publishable, doesn't stick in the mind, and would be 'meh' if you saw it a second time. That's how I feel about this book. It's amusing, but ultimately lacking substance.I thought the funniest parts were about Dave's sister Amy and not about Dave. Dave comes on strong with opinions, though they are couched in wit, and I didn't always agree. Maybe I saw the cynicism behind the humor? This soured the good mood the book creates.This is a great book to borrow from a library, but not a good book to own unless you find it hilarious. For me, it's not a re-reader, thus three stars. I enjoyed it while reading, but I would not enjoy reading it again."
3,Mixed feelings.,"We picked the book for our December book club since we tend to have our holiday pot luck then. We like light reads in December. Came with very high reviews, but many in the group did not find it funny. I found it entertaining and funny at times. One book member thought it was quite funny, but most were luke warm. Funniest if read over time and not in one sitting, I think. It's a short, easy read at any rate."
5,Wonderful starting point for Sedaris!,"After years of thinking of reading Sedaris, a friend strongly recommended this book to me, and I'm delighted he did. Sedaris had me laughing often, relating to his stories and characteristics. I read this book, and now I'm hooked!!"
5,This book is VERY GROOVY,"The book Me Talk Pretty One Day, by David Sedaris, is an absolutely hilarious book. The whole time that I read it, I laughed. This book is a collection of humorous essays by Sedaris, based on episodes of his lifetime, which he took upon himself to embellish and make funnier.My favorite parts of the book were his French speaking efforts. Teachers who hate him and would rather have a cesarean section than be with him and his problems learning the language make these sections funnier than most. Another good essay is `The Fatty Suit,' in which his sister Amy wears a fat suit to make their father, who is obsessed with being in shape, upset.Need a good laugh? Read this book. It is roll on the floor laugh your bum off funny."
3,this book funny me made laugh,"I hate short stories. They leave me wondering why the author didn't think the character or the plot significant enough to explore in the greater detail of a novel. That said, I really enjoyed Sedaris's ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"". The first half of the book, ""One"", was filled with stories about Sedaris's family. Stories of the sort that every family retells around the kitchen table when gathered together again as 'grown-ups' (Remember the time Amy came home in the fat suit and dad thought she'd REALLY gained all that weight?!? Mom and Dad love that new dog more than they EVER loved us kids when we lived at home!). Amusing and fun to read. ""Deux (Two)"" recounts Sedaris's time as an ""ex-pat"" in France. Having struggled through French, German and Spanish myself and watching my own ESL students learn to untangle reflexives made this half of the book particularly amusing. Fun, witty, loony and irresistibly funny: just like the reviews say."
3,A bit disappointing,"After breezing through Sedaris' previous three books -- all of which had me laughing out loud -- I found this fourth entry in his collection to be a bit of a non-starter. The second half of his essays, in which he details his experience as an ex-pat living with his boyfriend in France, whizzes by with typically sardonic Sedaris wit. But the first half felt stunted, tired, and a bit...dare I say it? Unfunny. I guess I expected a bit more. The droll humor didn't quite do it for me."
4,One of the Funniest Books Around!,"This was my first Sedaris book. Needless to say, it won't be my last. While there were a few stories that left me searching for the punchline, the majority of them were hilarious! I haven't laughed this much since reading ""Without Feathers"" by Woody Allen. I also enjoyed the diversity of the stories presented; it wasn't uncommon for a story about social inequality to be followed by one rife with toilet humor. My advice--read this book!"
5,HANKY PLEASE,"One day I happened to walk into an overcrowded bookstore where some unknown-to-me author was doing a signing. ""What's all the fuss,"" I asked my daughter and with my interest aroused I listened to this quirky little man doing some readings. Soon I was screaming with laughter along with the crowd and my now favorite author had been discovered. His outlook on life and stories about friends and family (especially zany sister Amy - one of David Letterman's best continuously returning guests) just holds the readers' interest until forced to put down the book. I was recently in an airport and noticed a lady reading ""Me Talk..."", and everytime she laughed I did also trying to picture where she might be. The only problem with David is: he hasn't written enough material. I can't wait for the next release."
2,It's Not Naked,"David had a brilliantly funny one with Naked, I laughed, I loved. But I was disappointed with Me Talk Pretty One Day, the reviews hyped it up to be this extraordinary passage of life abroad, but it took forever to get abroad. It was not as funny as Naked and I expected way too much."
2,I don't get why everyone raves about him,"I must admit, while I found some of his stories interesting and things I could relate to, and very easy to read, I don't understand all of the raves about him - the funniest writer around, side-splittingly funny, etc. A friend who has read other things by him thought that it might just be an acquired taste, as she has found each of his works progressively funnier. Sorry, but I really didn't like reading it, kept waiting for it to be over, and would have put it down if I wasn't reading it for a book club. Just being honest."
3,dysfunctional family!,"I can't deny that this book is really funny, I got hooked from the first page reading about his speech problem but after several chapters, I lost interest, it is really hilarious to read about his family, but then the comic mood didn't satisfy me as a reader wanting more essence to his novel. It became a narration of a gay 40 something male and his wretched life, from drugs, failure in school, living in Paris with his boyfriend and really nothing substantial. Even when he talks about his family and how weird they are, you laugh hard, but then he leaves it as an open window for you to comment. You wonder what made him lead such a life, his parents? the way he grew up?The writing is easy and smooth. You feel sometimes as if he is actually talking to you which makes it a fun read."
2,Not that funny,"I read this book because an acquaintance claimed it was one of the funniest books he'd ever read. The stories are neat and well-written, but not unusually funny. The comedy is mainstream and fairly common, meaning that it can very easily be duplicated. Most readers could themselves come up with stories about their own lives that are equally funny. Mild humor, I laughed out loud only once. This book is highly overrated. If you're interested in the true comedy, read PG Wodehouse."
1,What a boring disappointment!,"I was looking for a good laugh, and many reviews led me to believe that Sedaris would come through, but this book is a disaster. I got a minor chuckle at best, and a great put-me-to-sleep at worst. If you're hoping for humor, go elsewhere."
2,Exceptionally unexceptional,"I found this book exceptionally unexceptional. The author's greatest talent seems to be at surrounding himself with interesting people who are themselves funny and noteworthy. It's a good, light read but nothing that hasn't been done (in fiction and non-fiction) for years by the likes of Woody Allen, Philip Roth, Henry Rollins..."
1,where are the funny parts?,I just bought this book as an e-book. I feel that I wasted my money and my time so far. I'm to page 53 and haven't found anything funny in the book yet. I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it.
1,I don't understand the positive reviews for this,"Everybody is entitled to their own opinions...i just feel I was duped into reading this by all of the positive reviews I read on Amazon and all over the back page. About 100 pages into this thing I couldn't go on anymore, it's just a waste of time. I didn't understand that point of the book...it wasn't funny....wasn't interesting....no points....I can go on and on.That being said, it is definitely down there but it is not the most-overrated ""comedy"" I have read, that would go to ""Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself"" by Alan Alda. If you want to read a funny book go for J. Maarten Troost's ""Getting Stoned With Savages"" or ""The Sex Lives of Cannibals"" but not his 3rd book."
2,"Should have been titled - ""A bum's Life""","I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them."
4,"Not gripping, but a fun read","I rather liked this book, though the humor wasn't consistent throughout. Several chapters were laugh out loud funny (for instance, the descriptions of David's french lessons) but large sections of the book in between were only moderately amusing. He certainly has lead an interesting life."
2,"Sorry, I didn't like it","I would have given this book 1 star but I added a '1 Star Credit' because at least I could finish it. This was my first Sedaris book. I read it because a friend recommended it. I had no idea it was supposed to be funny... even at the end of the book. I feel sort of bad to say I didn't like it because I can tell he is a good writer. But I just didn't enjoy this. It took me forever to finish the book and at the end all I could think was ""Thank goodness that is OVER""."
3,Not what i thought it would be :(,I read it hoping to find a glowing essay to be uplifted by or tolaugh out loud . But I failed to find one .The story about his Dad and the food he buys and hoards and eats much much to much later was just too weird and grosse!
3,He Write Funny Some Day,"Sederis' latest collection of essays are definitely hit-or-miss. When he attempts to illustrate his theme, communication, through the repetition of key details about his life he is often merely repetitious. Yes, David, you were a rascal to take so many drugs. Now get over yourself. Still, when he choses to move beyond his own behaviors to observe others he is both scathingly funny and offers real insight into the complexity of human interactions. Overall, the book is worth reading."
1,Disappointed,"I saw this book listed on a bunch of people's ""funniest books I've ever read"" lists. I didn't enjoy it at all. The stories were boring and uneventful. I only finished it because I felt obligated after spending $10 on it for my kindle."
2,Humor?,"Maybe, being a 60 plus, I simply do not understand Sedaris' humor, but this book is the biggest disappointment I have read in a long time. Moderately entertaining, perhaps, but funny, no! If you want laugh-out-loud funny, read any of the Stephanie Plum mysteries by Janet Evanovich; or Edward Abbey's ""Monkey Wrench Gang"" or anything by Dana Stabenow, funniest being ""Breakup""; or anything by Carl Hiassen or Dave Barry. Mark Twain is funny and smart. Sedaris is pathetic."
1,Not Good Humor to Me.,"I didn't enjoy the book. Wasn't funny like the reviews on the back of the book read. Some may have found it funny, but to me it was a pointless list of uneventful life stories..."
4,Such an outrageous sense of humor...,"David Sedaris makes me laugh. I first heard him reading ""The Santaland Diaries"" on my local NPR radio station and I was hooked.This book is another one that you can dip into now and again and sample the varying products of Sedaris' offbeat sense of humor.Here he talks about the rigors of learning French (in France), and my favorite story is his description of trying to explain Easter customs in the US (in French) to people from other countries who are also learning French. A classic!"
2,Disjointed and disappointing,"After hearing much raving about Sedaris I looked forward to reading this book. The first chapter made me laugh out loud but it was downhill from there. I found it disjointed, rude and often crude and had to work hard to finish the book. Very disappointing."
