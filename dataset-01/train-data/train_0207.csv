2,A movie saved only by its unintentional humor...,"Where do I start on this turkey? The stupid story, the bad acting or the even worse singing. Yes, that's right, singing. This is the Sci-Fi movie that doesn't know if it's a story about a giant lizard or a vehicle to promote a new singing sensation. Well, they should have stuck with the lizard, because the singer was definitely not the next Bobby Darin. I awarded 2 stars because of the movie's saving grace: its unintentional humor."
4,A Mixture of Humor and Corniness!,"I first discovered the film, ""The Giant Gila Monster"" while watching Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the commentary given by the characters on the show really made this film funny, watching the film by itself also lent some humor.The story centers around a small town that is ravaged by a giant gila monster that emerged from the desert. While the gila monster wreaks havoc on the town and the town's people, the audience is also treated to the singing of Don Sullivan, who plays the lead. While it was funny at first, by the end of the movie you'll want to scream if you have to hear the song, ""Laugh Children Laugh"" one more time!All in all, I did like this movie. It's interesting to see the archaic special effects that were probably cutting edge back in 1959 and compare them to the out-of-this-world effects used now. For those of you who love those old, drive-in movies that are purely for entertainment this is the one for you!"
3,Cheesy but enjoyable,"In Texas somewhere, 2 teens have been reported missing as the local authorities are searching for them even Sheriff Jedd (Fred Graham) and mechanic Chase (Don Sullivan) are trying to find what was behind this until they discover the title beast who is a strange mutant creature of sorts.An enjoyable in a cheap fashion horror flick that is your typical giant lizard on the run flick. The effects are extremely cheap as it's a rear-projected live Gila Monster at times including a puppet, the acting is corny and the story is kind of inane but there's a charm to it. Despite the slow pacing, this one whips up decent cheese and has became a great candidate as an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 which it deserved to be riffed.Best seen on MST3K."
1,Drive-In Schlock Gets Widescreen Treatment,"Hot rods, rock music and monster mayhem are poorly served in this low-budget schlockfest. A 1959 drive-in favorite, ""The Giant Gila Monster"" offers incongruous laughs, a few ukulele numbers and incredibly unspecial effects. When Don Sullivan croons the immortal ""Laugh, Children, Laugh,"" you'll never forget it! Unlike other public-domain releases, this Image DVD boasts a decent widescreen print to help recapture the drive-in experience. Produced by Ken ""Festus"" Curtis and directed by Ray Kellogg (who would later collaborate with John Wayne on ""The Green Berets"")."
4,Flathead Fever!,"My fellow Motorheads will get a kick out of this movie simply for the period hot rods; a half-dozen T-buckets powered by the long gone Flathead Ford V-8! I often wonder what happened to those old rides, hopefully some were perserved.As for the movie itself, well it's bad but doesn't take itself too seriously. Too much 1950's stuff is crammed into the movie for a two hour horror flick. Hot rods, rock and roll, teen angst, rich vrs poor, and of course the rich girl dating the poor boy. All this and a giant Gila monster! They could have had about three decent movies (budget allowing of course) out of this low budget gem that tries to do too much with way too little.Viewed as a fun piece of nostaglia it is certainly worth watching."
2,Only for Gruberova fans,"The minimalist staging and silly clothes are a turn off for such a historical opera. With some operas it can work well, but not this one. The stage direction wasn't much better.....really distracting.Gruberova is sadly well past prime, but could be fine in less demanding roles with a lot less high notes. She tries for chest voice in the low notes but just gets hoarsness. But the audience applause shows what a great following she has. The lady is gutsy to take on this role and I do admire her for that.Franco Vassallo was quite good, but a bit lyric for such a nasty guy. Made me want to hear him in lighter roles.Back to my Australia version with Sutherland"
1,Abartig !!!,Frau Gruberova heult sich durch die Partie in einer absolut widerlichen Produktion von Euro-Trash-Regisseur Ch. Loy. Schade um Donizettis gro√üartiges Werk!
3,"Cute colors, but a little big...","I love Nuby products and found the colors of this ""key"" set really attractive and different from most pretend keys. I have an almost 5 month old who loves to put things in her mouth, but this set is a litte chunky and big for her small hands and mouth. The keys are quite ""fat"" and the set itself is a bit heavy for an infant."
3,Just okay.,My daughter actually prefers chewing on her pacifier to these keys. They are just too big for her mouth. She does like to play with them and shakes them around like a rattle though.
1,Heavy and not the babies favorite,Boutht this for my twins. It ends up just sitting around. It's very heavy so not really something they like to play with. The plastic is hard to so they have smacked it on their heads. There are plenty of other teethers out there that are softer/lighter. Not something I would recommend
5,Best teething key rings on the market!!,"With the bold colors and cool patterns and the ability to freeze them, these are my daughters favorite teething toy... right next to sophie the giraffe"
5,Cute toy for baby,This toy was larger than I thought it would be! It's really cute and the bright colors contrast nicely with the black and white part. We've attached it to my granddaughter's changing table as a minor distraction. Love that it has different textures which should come in handy once she starts teething.
3,Not very interesting,My son didn't really like this toy. It was a little more on the harder side. The keys you can put in the fridge/freezer are much better for teething.
5,Timeless and tightly-woven,"Richard Adams has long been my favorite 20th century novelist. His ability to make an epic fantasy feel intimate and utterly believable, in addition to his brilliant imagination, sets him apart from every other fantasy novelist I've ever read.Shardik is no exception. I just finished reading Shardik for the second time and can't help but marvel at Mr. Adams' genius. The world he describes in Shardik (and again in Maia) is as unforgettable as its denizens.Shardik and its companion piece/prequel, Maia, are no longer available commercially, but there are still a lot of copies floating around out there that I'm sure Amazon could hunt down for you. Don't miss the opportunity to read this story. Not only will you love it, you'll probably find yourself wishing that Mr. Adams had written even more about the land of Bekla."
1,Shardik is a waste of trees,"Having loved Watership Down, I grabbed feverishly at the first pages of the ""bear"" version only to be asleep in minutes. This book is almost unbelievably slow. It is about strange tribes on strange lands and a giant bear-god.I know that talking rabbits is not exactly reality, but this book should reside in the fantasy section of your local library alongside Terry Pratchett, Tolkien, or even in the bin. I am sure there are many out there who can find comparisons with our own world, with some extremely meaningful message to save mankind from everlasting doom etc etc, but I simply found it awful.It is no surprise that no-one has ever heard of Richard adam's follow up to Watership Down. Most people are probably too embarressed to mention the two books in the same sentence"
4,Challenging but worthwhile,"""Shardik"" must have seemed something of a shock to readers who had adored Adams' ""Watership Down."" The author's first book was thoroughly enjoyable and accessible, a modern fable that read like a magical adventure. ""Shardik,"" by contrast, was epic fantasy, steeped deeply in philosophical questions, especially those concerning the nature of religion and the apparent need in the human soul for spirituality.I confess I have not read this novel as many times as I have read other books by Adams, especially ""The Plague Dogs,"" which I would rank as my favorite. Yet there are tremendous rewards here for the patient reader. First of all, Adams' gift for language is as deft as ever. Second, the story itself is absolutely compelling.But in the end, ""Shardik"" emerges as a canny exploration of myth and an examination of our hunger for sacred meaning in life. This is not, in my view, the author's best book, but it is one of his most ambitious."
4,interesting,I read Watershipdown by Richard Adams and wanted to read more of his books. If you liked Watershipdown you will probably like this one too.
3,Bear or agent of God?,"Richard Adams next effort, after the wonderful 'Watership Down', attempts to transfer the sweep and mythos of that book to a human arena with mixed results. A huge bear fleeing a forest fire stumbles into a poor backward island of Ortelga and is proclaimed to be an agent of God heralding a return to fortune for Ortelga.The book starts promisingly, but loses its sense of mystery and myth after a third of the story (after the conquest of Bekla). Adams has interesting points to make, mainly how a religion can be corrupted with even the best intentions. But its not done well enough to sustain the story..."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Ursine avatars can be a bit tedious.Shardik being that avatar in the religion of the native people, and more particularly, the native character that this book is about. He convinces people of this really big bear's religious significance. This gets him a position of religious power, and what do people often do with that? Yep, want to go and do a bit of that large scale killing war stuff.It isn't all quite that simple though for the main guy as his attitude changes throughout."
3,A book worth reading,"I would have liked this book more, had it focused entirely on the religious/mythical theme, especially on the question whether Shardik is a natural or supernatural creature; this aspect of the story is very well crafted. But unfortunately Adams tried to pack into the book a lot of extra luggage, as for example a panoramic and not too successful view of the inhabitants of the land; or a moralistic and sociological message awkwardly embodied in the figure of the giant bear. The portion that deals with Genshed is overdone and excessively grim; the final chapters are too melodramatic and preachy. However the novel contains some truly powerful and haunting scenes, like the Streels of Urtah and the Foothills battlefield.In sum, this was a book worth reading."
4,Iniciation,"I read Shardik when I was 14 years old (now I am 40). It was the first book that introduce me to the mistery of live. Of violence, acceptation, divinity in a new way than I did not knew etc. In those times, I choose book by the history, not by the author. And hopely I did the good choice. The book is still with me. I suppose that any teenager (more male) will like it."
5,An excellent book!,"I read this book years ago in hardcover, and enjoyed it so much when I saw it offered as a Kindle HD version I had to have it. The storyline is believable and well developed, and the characters are so real at times I felt I'd actually met them in person. Well worth buying!"
5,Love. Love. Love.,"If you enjoyed reading Watership Down, then you should give Shardik a try. It took some effort to get into the story, but once I was in it, I was hooked."
4,Most of us have all been there.,"In this story, we visit something that many of have experienced. What is the world outside of our homes like at 3am? You know it's different....but just how different? If you never explored your neighborhood late at night then this will help you. If you have, well then this book is preaching to the quior. May the gods of darkness hide your true identity."
5,High quality product,This connector was used to make a custom length generator cable for my travel trailer. The quality is excellent and connecting it to the cable was easy. Exactly what I needed for my project.
2,Boots too short,"I bought two of theswe units and find the female connection does not go into the boot deep enough. I was unable to screw the entire connector onto the back of my boat. I will now be forced to buy new cables. When one adds the cost of this failed attempt, the two cables become increasingly expense. The boots need another quarter to three-eights inches of depth to accomdate a female plug."
5,Easy to use,This is an easy to install system for a boat shore power plug. However it costs almost as much as a new cord and plug. My cord was good so I repaired it with this plug. It is not as sound as a new cord and plug but it will do.
1,"terrible fit for the S2 IS, S3 IS , and S5 IS","The rear threading on this lens is 48mm while adapters for S2, S3, and S5 are 58mm so you'll get bad tunnel effect. I cannot believe that they are marketing this as being for the Canon Sx IS series."
4,12 hr Bug out Bag,Great 12 hr bag. Little small but has room for everything I need it for. I primarily use it as a range bag or patrol bag. Excellent quality and several pockets and attachment slots. Staps including waist are comfortable. Overall good bag
1,CRAP,"the right shoulder strap was defective, it would not stay taught rendering the strap totally useless. there was also a three inch tear in the bottom of the main compartment. i didnt even use it once. the pictures are deceiving, the product is of low quality."
4,Assault,"nice quality, but some of the straps are a little tight and make it tough to open. over all thought great quality"
2,Review,The item itself was too small to be used for what I was intending on using It for. I was also a little displeased with how long it took to get to me. The item was in great shape so for that I was pleased with.
2,Uncomfortable and cheap.,"I used this for school for a while and for a camping trip. We hiked maybe two miles and it dug into my shoulder the entire time. It wasn't loaded heavily either, there just isn't a lot of padding on the straps."
1,Liked it until the side ripped out!,"I have had the bag for less than six months, and it has started to fall apart. I use it for my small laptop and take it to work everyday, so although it gets used everyday, it would say it's lite use. About a month ago, one of the plastic straps broke. Then today the entire side of the bag (top to bottom) ripped open.Although I liked it in the beginning, I have to say it's junk."
1,Complete junk!,"To start off with, when I received the pack, the box it came in had a huge hole in one side of it. The box looked like someone kicked the crap out of it. The item was damaged during shipment (broken buckle) and when I loaded the pack up; it ripped as soon as i zipped it shut. The material that the pack consists of is cheap and easily torn. I RMA'd the pack the same day I got it. Be smart, save your money and buy a quality pack."
4,Rugged,The pack is well built and is a nice size for a go bag for essentials. It allows you to compliment your battle bag and CBRN gear
1,BAG IS VERY SMALL,this bag is big enough for maybe 2 days worth of supplies. the quality of the bag is subpar and the pictures are extremely deceiving
3,Smaller than I thought,"It is a good backpack but smaller than I thought.pros: lots of compartment, adjustable and qualitycons: sizeshould be larger!!!!"
1,these shoes stink!,"I was so excited to get these shoes. I ordered the plain black and the red brocade. When they arrived, I could smell mothballs before I opened the package. The shoes themselves smelled hideous, but they were cute, so I tried wearing them anyway. No deal. I couldn't get the smell to go away. I washed them in the machine, left them to dry outside, covered them in baking soda, drenched them in perfume all to no avail. I had to toss them. Hopefully it was an isolated incident, but it WAS 2 different colors. The shoes themselves were comfortable enough and cute, but I can't walk around with mothball toes."
1,Terrible- Skip this title,"We were left speechless at the amateurish and poor quality of this production. The demeanor of the ""team leader"" (we only see him and his wife) made us question the validity of his findings."
2,motion sickness - jumpy camera motion,"I wish someone had mentioned in their reviews about the jagged motion of the camera while the investigators were walking; because I was not able to watch this movie. After watching 20 minutes of the movie I started to get motion sickness. I would not have rented this if I had known about this, that would have been a helpful review.So 20 minutes into it..I jumped forward 15 min to escape the moving camera..but came across it again, so I kept jumping forward (there were some still stable shots at times...but also moving filming that was jumpy). Sad to say I had to stop watching because I was feeling a little sick from the constant jumpy walking motion of the camera, so I never got to hear those sounds others mentioned in their reviews.If you are someone who gets motion sickness, you may want to pass on this film...but if you don't, then maybe it is the movie for you. Me?, I wish I had my rental fee back."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"This was one of the worst and most boring films on bigfoot. They show a few foot prints and record some noises at night, other than that they spend most of the time talking about the equipment they use. I had to write this review because I went off of how many stars it was rated and was sadly disappointed."
3,Abridged? Why???,"I'm almost afraid to read this interpretation. I found the original edition in a Galveston antique store for fifty cents years after the person to whom I had lent my original copy vanished without returning it - after a delightful weekend of rediscovery I looked it up, curious to see the opinions of other readers. This new version is apparently edited for youthful sensitivities. What could possibly been have been considered unsuitable for young adults in this era of Britney Spears and glorified teen pregnancy in ""Juno"" I cannot imagine. Parents, if you have an old copy on the shelves, don't waste money on the new version. If it's the only one available, however, don't rob anyone of a good read."
5,One of my Favorite Books,"As an owner of one of the original 1980 unabridged editions of Amanda/Miranda, I can attest to the extraordinary writing quality of this story. Beginning with the first few lines of the Prologue until the very last page, an intricate old world story is beautifully crafted. It is written so artfully that certain passages read like prose. In addition, Mr. Peck's gifted writing style congers up such vividly clear images that while reading this tale, you feel as though you are also watching the movie. Die hard romantics (such as myself) will devour it."
4,interesting read,This is a good read for a teenager but the original version is better for an adult.
1,I really didn't like it,"This book was decently written, but I just didn't like it very much. I felt that it was too contrived, too obscure, and characters one could not relate to. There was too much psychic distance from the characters to know what they were thinking. If you're looking for a book about the Titanic, which I must admit I was, this isn't one. Try Titanic: the Long Night by Diane Hoh, which, while it is also in 3rd person dramatic, it is much more interesting and comprehendable."
1,Utterly horrible!,"""Amanda Miranda"" is by far the worst book I have ever read. They must have abridged all the exciting, good parts out of the story! Peck isn't my favorite author, but this plot sounded very intriguing, but I was only able to read a few pages a day. The Titanic was not introduced until the end of the novel, and when it was mentioned, it was brief. I do not recommend."
5,A great resource from two great professors!,Rosenwasser and Stephen demonstrate that knowing how to write is knowing how to think. This is a resource I used throughout college and still use today.
4,Writing Anayltically,Practical book for school but also well written. Ideas and thoughts therein are easy to understand. A definite keeper after the class is over.
1,Boring and repetative,There are better books out there about writing than this book. The book was very boring and repetative. The authors talk to you as if you are a teenager.
4,come along for the trip home,This is a book that would suck you in within just the first paragraph. Houlden Caufield is a character that's sure to remain with you days after you are done reading the book. Throughout his journey home from being kicked out of school Houlden takes you on a trip around New York city visiting some of the places the city is infamous for and on the way you see him work out his frustration and rebellion. By the timeHoulden gets home he realizes that he can't run away from life anymore but rather live it as best as he can with what he is given.Salinger's use of profanity and his laid back and easy going tone appeals greatly to teenagers. While reading you are sure to forget that you are reading and as Houlden makes his way home you in turn leave feeling a little bit more accepting of your own life. I truly think teenagers will appreciate this book and will also gain from it immensely.
2,It is not that good.,"I had read that this was a great classic book, instead I only found a book that was very slow and mostly boring. By reading some of the other reviews I can tell that I am not the only one that thinks this way, honestly, I only kept reading because I took this book on a trip and really did not have anything else to do at night.It is a story about a teenager that rebels against school and parents (what else is new?), he runs away and spend several days hanging around not really doing anything interesting and always complaining.Maybe you would still like to read this book, that is your decision, my personal opinion, I would not bother, there are much better options out there."
3,Overrated,"Although the book was at times entertaing, this book is not one of the better classic novels. The writing is often redundant and boring. Salinger, however, does portray his main character very well. In short, the book wasnt all bad, but it did not have a profound impact on me and does not stick out in my mind as a fantastic classical novel."
3,Depends on who's reading it.,"How much you'll like this book depends on how much you'll relate to it.If you're a young teenager with a bitter edge, you'll probably end up enjoying this book and relating very well to Holden Caulfield and his general worldview. I read this book when I was 12 or 13, angsty, and had a big chip on my shoulder. I loved it. I was wowed, amazed that someone could have been thinking the same things I had been thinking in such earlier years.Now, I am not -that- much older, a little wiser (I think), but I've definitely outgrown my spat of bitterness. I try reading it, but now Holden just seems whiny and immature."
1,Does not live up to the hype,"Catcher in the Rye is supposed to be the book of the times. We read it in school to get a feel about universal issues present to both the world and the person during the sixtys. I personally thought the book was terrible. Mainly becaue I had trouble getting off to a good start. The book has no real story at all. All it is about is some kid and the emotional impact that different people and situation have on him. I mean, this is not even a book. All it is is a reevaluation of someone's life in terms of emotion. Besides needing to read this for school, if I had known the book was like this, I never would have read it, and would have relied on CliffNotes for symbolism."
1,End equal Middle,"Would have rather read something else. I really didn't like the book. To me the ending just stoped and it left many questions unanswered. Holdens constant whining and complaining really bugged me, and it drove me nuts how he would always repeat himself over and over again. One part that I liked is when he is at home with Phoebe, and they are in her room dancing to the music. Other then that part, the book didn't interest me that much."
5,Still the best,"I never thought I would actually have to review this book; I sort of assumed that everyone knew it was great. If some people deem it worthy of less than a five-star review, though, I have to come to its defense.Since it was written, no one has been able to achieve this level of complete absorbtion. It's every bit as relatable today as it was then. It's sacred.Some people claim to have outgrown it. These are the sort of people you don't want to know."
2,Ugh,"Maybe I'm in the minority, but I really didn't care for this book. It's very depressing all around and I left me with no closure. What's more, I hated Holden; how much do you really want to read about a character you hate?"
1,I Don't Get It,"I had heard so much about this so called classic that when I found it included in a box of used books given to me I eagerly attacked it. 10 pages in I was puzzled...20 pages in I was sure I was missing something...30 pages in I was bored to tears. I stuck through this sorry mess to the bitter end in the hopes that there might be some redeeming factor to it but, alas, there was none to be found. This book was obviously an attempt to speak to the feelings of loneliness and alienation often felt by adolescents but the protagonist's self-pitying, stream of consciousness torrent of complaints against all of existance left me wanting to scream ""Shut the @#?! up"". Truly one of the worst books I have ever read."
1,Dull,"Every page of this book is the same. It has no building up of events. Or... any events for that matter. It goes from him getting kicked out of school to waiting around in the city to going home and doing nothing. Not saying he will do better in school...no relationships...no action. You learn about what this 17 year old thinks about the people around him, his brothers, his sister , and what he does in the city for a few days. Nothing more exciting or different than your life. So if you take a few minutes of your life and self reflect about a time you were bored...you'll save a few bucks and some time that way."
1,give me a break,"I've read lots of literature; more than you might imagine.I read this thinking that I had missed a classic.This book does NOT ""capture the rawness, is so enthralling, blah, blah, blah.""It IS outdated and whiny. Instead of feeling empathy with a depressed main character, I feel the urge to only slap him.Why this has achieved classic status only attests to what P.T. Barnum said about people, numbers and fooling."
5,Excellent Goddam Book,"A lot has been said about this wonderful book and what I am going to say will probably be much of the same. I loved this book. I bought it for my dad for xmas and I ended up reading it myself. It's on the reading list for my english class so i figured i'd read it ahead of time. I read the book in two days, i couldn't put it down. I found myself really identifing with holden. I have gone through a lot of similar problems that holden went through in the book and I came out of it actually feeling smarter and wiser about life, the first time a book has ever done this to me. The relationship between holden and pheobe was my favorite aspect of the book, especially the chapter when holden is in pheobe's room. The book is pretty funny too, like when he gets all nervous when the prostitute comes to visit him. I very much reccommend this book to everyone, especially teenagers. I'm on my way to re-reading it now, it's that damn good. Easily my favorite book."
4,Still the model....,"Holden Caufield, the main character in this short, easily-read novel, remains the model for disaffected youth in modern literature.When reading this, who among us hasn't felt like Holden? Not knowing where we are, where we should be, where we belong, what we should be doing, just simply existing."
2,If you like the commentary on our world,I never really liked this book (probably because I was forced to read it when I was young). But reading the reviews here reminds me of my favorite book. If you like social commentary - GO READ STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. Check the reviews....you will find them equally as passionate
3,The Catcher in the Rye,"With the recent death of its author, J.D. Salinger, I felt that it was time to finally do something I have been intending to do for years, read his classic. I was disappointed. Maybe it was because I had high expectations after all the hype. Maybe it was because I kept expecting something to happen, you know, the classic building action, climax, resolution thing. This book is nothing like this.Written about a couple of days in the life of a teen who was newly expelled from yet another private high school, the author explores the traditionally pessimistic, skeptic, somewhat depressing view that youth has about the world created by his predecessors. Written with plenty of voice, this book is an enjoyable read, as the reader waits for something to develop. I could almost hear the voice of this book's contemporary, Jack Kerouac, in the pages. But nothing does happen. Maybe that was the author's point. In any case, I found that disappointing."
5,book purchase,"After Salinger's death, I wanted to reread The Catcher in the Rye, so ordered a used paperback. It is in new condition and I'm quite happy with it. Delivery was within the estimated time."
2,Boring,Found this book to be slow and a little boring. I hear enough complaining in real life I don't need to read about someone complaining too.
5,Quick Review - Best Fictional Book I've Ever Read,"I won't go into a long review here-- I read mostly non-fiction because fiction typically bores me. About 10-20% of the time, though, I like to switch to fiction to enjoy ""lighter"" reading than the non-fiction I typically read. I picked up Catcher in the Rye in a bookstore on a whim the other day. It really, really blew me away! I NEVER laugh out loud when I'm reading, and I must've literally laughed outloud several dozen times when reading this book. It was SO funny! And just brilliantly written, enjoyable to read, fun but serious at times, etc. Just a great book, a classic, and one that I should've read earlier in life (I'm 37 now). I will likely re-read it every few years just to remind myself how much of a page-turner it was..."
4,Has lost little of its luster,"As profoundly insightful as a novel can be, CATCHER IN THE RYE is the best novel I've read this summer, except for perhaps THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, which has a protagonist that reminds me of Holden Caulfield. But I'll review Triumph on its own page. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is just remarkable, a novel of such truth that only the finest works of Hemingway or Faulkner can touch it in recent American literature."
5,To be a Teenager!,"I can understand how some people would find this book incredibly dull because honestly, nothing really happens except this 16 year old bitches about his life. But, it cracks me up every time I read it. Sophomore year, my advanced english class read it and all my friends simply adored it. It wasn't the typical run-of-the-mill english book. This book made you laugh, made you think, and made you understand, if not actually feel for Holden. Salinger is a genius (and quite mysterious). ""Franny and Zoey"" made no sense to me since I didn't have an english teacher to explain it to me, but I'm four years out of sophomore english and still read this book every year. I'm glad it wasn't banned in my high school!!"
3,NOT a classic,"I have been hearing about this book ever since the mid Eighties. I finally bought it and read it - and although it was not the worst book I have read, it was no classic either.The hero is a regular teenager, from a well to do white family, who leaves boarding school and goes around more or less aimlessly for a few days. He is of course confused, and full of thoughts, which may have caused a sensation 50 years ago, but is a cliche today. There is nothing truly rebellious about him.A classic to me is a book that stands the test of time. This book has certainly failed to maintain its initial relevance over the years. Still, it is not too bad as a regular adolescence book."
2,Should be called 'Much Ado About Nothing II',"Another good title for the book could be 'The Dopey, Immature Kid with a Lousy Attitude'. I read this book twice, once as an immature teenager and the second time as an immature adult. The reason I read the book again as an adult was to find the so-called 'great meaning and powerful ideas' that are supposedly contained in the novel. I found absolutely nothing of significance and meaning that would qualify this novel as a classic or masterpiece.Basically, this novel is simply about an immature, screwed up, mentally disturbed, brat with a terrible attitude. The only thing the kid needs is a good, hard kick in his butt. Don't get me wrong. It's an interesting read and somewhat enjoyable, but that's all there is to it. If you want to read a great novel with real significance and superb insight about our world then read '1984' by George Orwell, the greatest novel I have ever read."
2,The Catcher In The Rye,"Although everyone seems to think it's a must read book, I tend to differ. I read this book at age 18 because I was sure I was missing out on something great, but it turned out that I wasn't missing much. Holden Caulfield, the main character, is cynical, selfish, and an all around jerk if you ask me. Also, J.D. Salinger's writing technique didn't impress me. He was very repeditive, and instead of getting his point across, it only succeeded in running his point into the ground. I was very let down by this novel."
2,What's the big deal?,"Maybe if I would have read this in high school it would have seemed cool. At 30, I don't get what is so great. Stream of conscious teenage ramblings. Is that hard to write?"
3,The catcher in the rye,"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. SalingerWhat's not to like about this book? A young, cute, very honest guy goes through all of the thoughts, problems, and relationships of teenage life. His name is Holden, Holden Caulfield and boy does he have problems! He can't find a college he likes. He's either getting kicked out, getting into trouble, or just not liking it enough to even try. But all he can think about is what he can do not to tell his parents right away. This book was published along time ago as in my parents even read it, but is still a very good book. It has lots of things in it that still happen a lot today. This book is a great read and I'm not the only one that thinks so The Catcher in the Rye is #9 on the list of the best english-language Fiction books of the twentieth century. It has a unique ending and you're not going to want to miss it! -RachelOrazem"
3,Jesus Christ!,"I have been reading these reviews and I don't think one single person really gets what the hell Salinger was trying to say. I don't know myself! Personally, I think that Holden is bi-polar because his moods fluxuate so rapidly. This is made worse by the death and continued grief of his brother Allie. Also, I think it's important to mention the part where Holden is staying at a former teacher's house and wakes to find the man stroking his hair. Later, Holden says that that sort of perverty thing had happened to him a lot when he was a child. So what I think we have here is a bi-polar teenager who has been molested and has never gotten over his brother's death. That would screw anyone up. Don't you think?"
2,Pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffft too much energy,"This is about the most boring and annoying book I've ever read. I don't now why but I have a preference for books who use still other words than Phoney, ""old"" and ""goddamned"". It is also perfect to ruin your day. Once you start reading this depressing novel from a boy who can't say a singular positive thing about his live, you can say goodbye to your happy feeling. There was only one positive thing about all this. I thought he put himself in a very strange position as a writer. He doesn't regard himself as being the all-knowing novelist, he puts himself kind of aside. You don't see that often. But than again, I think he's just trying to be the underdog, someone eccentric. Well, mister Caulfield, there are other ways besides just being negative about everything to get attention."
5,Most beloved novel of the 20th century.,"I just reread this for about the 12th time (I'm 47) and was reminded of just how importantant this book was to me when I was growing up. The first time I read this book, when I was about 13, I was amazed that there was someone else in the world that thought like I did. It let me know that I was not alone and I was not a weirdo. My favorite book of all time and my choice for best novel of the 20th century."
5,Best ever book!!,"BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!! im not really a big reader but i was going on a trip and wanted a book to read.. by chance i stumbled upon catcher and the rye, i knew it was some sort of classic or something and figured its always good to know those books.. so i purchased it, i couldn't put it down!!"
1,Classic? Read Of Mice & Men Instead,"God D....t, somebody finally has to have the courage to tell the truth. Old Roxanne wasted 3 hours of her life reading all about a kid that she just wanted to slap upside the head. I'm a mad woman; I really am."
2,As entertaining as it wasn't...,"Having been forced to read this horrid novel for English, I can say that it is possibly the most boring book. Looking back, I can't recall anything of importance happening. Angst angst angst. Did I read the same book as the 5 stars?Innovative and enlightening? I think not. It's one dull page after another as Holden explores the woes of life. No teenager is this seriously depressed. Everything makes him feel lonely and sad. He swears every other word. Everyone is a phony. I had no patience for his lameness. I only got through it to pass the section on it.They say he grieves for Allie. You hear more about random classmates of his than of his brother. No character can hold your attention in this book. It is so blah and bland, I can't think why anyone would want to read it, let alone read it again."
1,not a great book,I am 12 years old and i started to read this book and found it not to be very good. It has about ten curse words on every page and i don't think it should. It also has a bunch of other stuff that younger kids should not read. Over all i found this a bad book and pretty boring too.
1,People are so annoying...,"Boring...slow...poorly written...outdated...and so very annoying. Not a classic by any stretch of the imagination. People that think it's a great book...are people that are always blaming someone else for why they are poor, stupid, or whatever else bad that they are plagued with."
2,Read this book if you have nothing else to do.,This book is boring. I read it for fun. Let me take that back. I didn't read it for school. But now I see why it's assigned so much in school. It helps keep kids busy until they turn 18. Sure I read only half the book; I was too bored to finish it. And I'm sure you don't esteem my opinion. But I sure do find it grand that such a crumby book is so well-respected. Did I relate to it? Sure. But why the hell would I want to relive my teen years?!
1,dumbing down our children,"A 1651 favorable reviews, who the hell could disagree ? Well I'll try..Been working in the various college bookstores since 1968, I had a chance to read a few pages from this book. Its literary quality is not that great, the emotional harmony with the increasingly more infantile american public signals the takeover of teeagers of the public life. We all saw the results. This is the basic affect of liberalism, with no positive vision of a possible action. However, even after 9/11/01, my son is compelled by the New York State to read this second rate fiction, alongside with "" The Chocolate War"", ""Lisa Bright and Dark"" and other ""pulp-fictiony"" type of ""STUFF"".How about some Faulkner, Hemingway, Dreiser, Dos Passos, Vidal, even Zane."
1,worst book,"This is the worst book i have read in a long time. NOTHING happens. I do not understand what is controversial about this story. It's about an ignorant boy (who says ""boy"" too much) and his pathetic little life. I felt like I was reading a book for a 9 year old, it's written very simplisticly, almost as if the author thought the reader would be too stupid to understand big words.I am dissapointed. I have heard about this book my entire life and when I finally read it I was surely let down. I don't get why this book is banned from some schools except for the fact that if students read it in school they'd be so bored they probably would never want to read anything ever again.I only gave it one star because there was nothing lower."
1,Not satisfied,The book was in poor condition. The pages were brown and stained. This is the 3rd time I've reviewed this product. Please don't send again. Terri
1,This book is clearly very overrated,"I read this book only cause everyone was talking about it and I wanted to know for myself, what it was about. First reading it, I thought how stupid and lame the boy was... I kept on reading cause I felt maybe there's more to it, maybe it'd get better. I was very wrong. This book is very predictable and has no plot. The character was annoying and boring. I wish there was a choice in 0 stars cause it's what this book deserves. I gave my copy away to my fiancee hoping she'll agree with the crap that is this book. NOTE: Monica don't be taken in with the simple closed minded readers!!"
1,This book doesn't even deserve a star....,"I'm sorry but I hate this book. It was horrible! I'm not a person that likes constant swearing so I guess that's one reason why I didn't like it very much. There was no climax to the book whatsoever, and barely a plot. I understand all the symbolism and I admit that it is great in this book, but I hate the book anway."
1,The Catcher in the Rye,"The biggest waste of reading material ever written. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did. To put it in Holden's words, J.D. Salinger is the biggest phony i've ever encountered."
3,Extremely depressing,"To be totally honest with you I thought the book is seriously over-rated. Maybe some day when I'm old and gray I'll understand the true meaning of this book. I got two things out of this book. First, that he wanted to save people, (catcher in the rye), and hewas totally messed up in the head. I beleive he was suffering from clinical Depression. PA"
1,WHAT A BORING STORY!!,"I know that everyone says that this novel is a CLASSIC, but it certainly did not live up to its standards. I felt that with it's scattered thoughts and events, that the novel clearly did not have a complete structure. It did not keep my attention and it totally bore me to DEATH!! I would not reccomend this novel to anyone, I would not want you to go through the pain and suffering!"
4,Immediate Impact for Young Adults,"I appreciate this less now that I am older, but the book had an immediate impact on me as a 16-year old."
2,Am I missing something?,"Sorry, but I found this book to be rather boring and repetitive. I did not like the character Holden, and thought he should grow up."
3,"Slow, but Holden is incredibly realistic","While I found the story itself slightly dull I found the character development to be spellbinding. Being a teen myself, I have often suffered through many author's ideas of how teenagers think (which are NEVER accurate), but Holden is the exception. I can name ten people I know who could be him. If you enjoy deep, complex characters, I reccomend it. Otherwise, I don't see what all the fuss is about."
3,"A mediocre read, but an accurate portrayal of teenage life","Catcher in the Rye is an interesting book, but not, as some may say, one of the best. It seems people read too much into the symbols in the book, and try to see things that aren't there. Even so, Salinger did not come up with a bad book. The portrayal of teenage life is excellent, and the feelings of the main character, Holden Caulfield seem to reflect ones which all of us have experienced at one time or another. As far as plot and depth go, however, this book is average, as is the style of writing. In other words, I've seen better, but I've also seen much worse."
5,A GREAT READ,"I read this book for English class but at first I didn't want to read it. As a teenager, I was really able to relate to Holden. At first I didn't like the book much, because Holden seemed too judgemental, but I discovered why he was like that. And his reasons seemed justified, and he was just reacting to the ugliness of the world. I feel the author did a great job with character development. And wrote from the perspective of a teenager, which Holden was. The only improvement I felt was needed was a new cover. I highly recommend this book for all age groups, especially for teenagers."
5,The Graduate of the literary world,"I'm damned glad Salinger will never allow this to be filmed. Picture it. Ethan Hawke whining and saying ""really"" a lot. Ugh!!I will read this book every two years until I'm too old to remember how it feels to be Holden Caufield. BECAUSE I read it every two years, I hope I'll never forget.If you're a 7th-grader reading it because it has curse words in it, read Judy Blume's Wifey or something, cuz you're missing the pointPeople who assail this book for its lack of plot might just as well try to learn botany from Monet's Waterlilies.No other novel of the last 50 years even comes close."
4,Not necessarily a classic but a sure blast to read,"If you were an independent type of kid who hated all of the popular phony types in grade school, this book is your diary. Holden represents anyone who refused to succumb to the ridiculous pressures of growing up."
3,Is a top 100 book and best seller only by popularity,"After teachers and friends telling me that I simply *HAD* to read it, I went out and spent 6 bucks on The Catcher in the Rye. If I wanted to be put to sleep I could have done it for much cheaper than 6 bucks. Perhaps it gained popularity because it was one of the first books to swear and show the grim reality of some aspects of life. There are numerous books which do this now, but are not nearly as popular as this one. I found the book lacking in plot, variety, climax, and skill in every way. While it was not the worst book I have read, it is still on my list of books I would rather have a root canal than read again. If someone wants to read about and experience the grim reality of the world, read ""Atlas Shrugged"". If you want to listen to a teenager whine repeatedly without any direction...call me (I'm 17) or waste the money and read Catcher in the Rye."
3,Not a bad read,"I don't get it. I read the book in an honors English class, I studied it, I talked about it, I thought about it. It's not bad, but it's not particularly good either. I think maybe it's just that for many teens (not all!) it's the first ""real"" book they ever read and really get, and that's because there's not much to get. Weird."
3,This book has good and bad points,"This book is very interesting. It shows the attitude of a teenager as well as the way one thinks. However, I found it hard to read because it skipped from one idea to another often. Overall, I saw this book as a good read for anyone who is trying to look in to the way a teenager thinks."
4,"Stimulating plot, abrupt ending","I had to read this book for my 11th grade English class. This book was really easy to read. I usually don't read any of the English books that are assigned to me, but I read ""The Catcher in the Rye"" anyway. The story was quite simple and interesting. My only complaint is the ending. I thought it was somewhat abrupt. But, all in all, it was an easy reading that had a stimulating plot."
2,OVERRATED- salinger's other works are much better,"Although I do have to agree with most of the people below that CATCHER is entertaining and a page-turner, it definitely did not give me the feeling of enlightenment reading other Salinger books did. CATCHER doesn't really have a plot or a meaning to me. Holden Caulfield is a boring, predictable, spoiled-brat prep school kid. Salinger's other characters (the Glass family) are much more multi-faceted and interesting. Do yourself a service and read Franny & Zooey or Raise the Roof Beam High, Carpenters & Seymour.His other books appeal to anyone on a spiritual search or who just want intelligently written books, not just teenagers who need to be coaxed with a mindless plot including lots of swearing, smoking, and sex to read a book. (by the way, i am a teenager, not a whiny middle-aged person)"
2,Here plot... come here....,"I have been reading this book the past couple days, I only have about sixty pages left. And I'm still looking desperately for a plot. It's amazing that a two hundred plus page book can be so popular when there is no plot that I can see. The entire thing, as far as I can see, is about this messed up kid that isn't happy unless he swears twice a sentence. He's obsessed with getting laid and that dumb duck thing. My English teacher says it has some metaphorical meaning, but I don't see it. I only give it two stars because it is well written, there's great voice in the book, it sounds like a real person is there narrating it orally. I dunno, maybe it'll get better, but I doubt the last sixty pages can redeem the first hundred and fifty."
1,I'm sorry!!!!,"I'm sorry, but I didn't like this book. It is supposed to be some amazing adventure into the everyday life of a teenager, full of shortcomings, pressures, angst and grief. IT WAS NONE OF THAT. I thought that it was a horrible peice of literature. I believe that it showed a whiny young man, who couldn't take responsibility for himself. He stayed mired in this self-pity and couldn't see why nothing went his way. I didn't care for this book at all. I beleive that the only reason that it caught fire was because it was so ""bad"" when it was published that it was banned. This being banned added a little mystique to it. Everyone read it and it did well. Oh, by the way, so there is no misinterpretation of my comments, I am a 17 year old male in California. Yes, a teenager actually hated the Catcher in the Rye. AMAZING! I welcome any comments at my e-mail address: hoss@neworld.ne"
2,A classic,"A classic that I could not finish. For me, long winded and not an inviting read. Donated to the LA County Public Library."
2,Hope I don't raise a kid like this,"This book made me scared to have children. The teenager in this book just wanders aimlessly in the book seeking attention because he comes from a broken childhood. He's very bitter and constantly uses vulgar language and makes sexual inferences in the book. I'm not exactly sure what the point of this book was unless it's describing how not to raise a kid or else he will end up this way. Holden Caulfiend was like James Dean, ""A Rebel Without a Cause."" He was bitter from page one to the end of this book. I never felt so empty until reading this book."
2,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS....,"I GOT THIS BOOK BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD. IN FACT, I THOUGHT IT WOULD AT LEAST BE OKAY...I WAS WRONG! AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS, I SEROUISLY THINK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WRONG BOOK HERE. HOW DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS BOOK SO MUCH? I GAVE IT 2 STARS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT YEAH, SURE THERE ARE WORSE BOOKS AROUND, SO THIS DOESN'T DESERVE THE WORST RATING, BUT PRETTY DANG CLOSE. ITS LITERALLY ABOUT A BOY COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS MISERABLLY LIFE FOR 300 pages...WASTE OF TIME!"
2,WOW! What a weird book,This book is definitly different. It made no sense to me at all. All that goes on is only in like 2 days. It feels like this is his whole life! It's definitly confusing. Beware swares galore! If you like werid books that are out there than this is a good book for you otherwise I wouldn't suggest it.
1,Why read this book?,"This is probably the second most overrated book in American Literature. I do not understand why people think this book is so great. I quickly tired of the protagonist's well-heeled puerile whining . I kept thinking, ""Grow up, for God's sake."" In short, I would argue that Salinger's insights and themes are stunted and trivial at best. To teh people who love this book I would sayGrow up and find out what real life is like and maybe read some real books"
3,Would have rather read something else.,"I really didn't like the book. To me the ending just stoped and it left many questions unanswered. Holdens constant whining and complaining really bugged me, and it drove me nuts how he would always repeat himself over and over again. One part that I liked is when he is at home with Phoebe, and they are in her room dancing to the music. Other then that part, the book didn't interest me that much."
3,well written but boring,"J.D. Salinger definitely knows how to capture voice and the whole essence of a character. Catcher in the Rye is a perfect example of this. He must have an excellent imagination to totally develop a character like Holden Caulfield. In the beginning of this book I did not like the main character, Holden. But after awhile I began to realize he wasn't so bad after all. I could not really get in to this american classic,though. Maybe because it was the first stream of conscience book I read."
2,This book was well writen but not liked....,"I found this book really well writen. The Athor is a very good writer; But I dont like the life of Holden. I think that most people can relate to the book; But I dont think that I really want, or most people, to know The life of someone and all his problumes.I am sorry if this botheres anyone about this book but I dont feel that people really want to read the problums of someones life. Thanks for reading this bye bye....."
3,Mediocre at best...,"Despite widespread fame and popularity, I believe that this novel is quite insignificant and deserves little of the esteem it has thus far been accredited. Holden Caulfield's story is not some inspiring, amazing book, but a simple story about a misguided adolescent. There's nothing more; indeed, it is amazing to know that many consider this a ""Great American Novel."" It surely does not deserve such a title, and I must oppose strongly those who inflate the novel's importance to literature."
2,the catcher in the rye,"this book wasn't that bad but I'm sure I wouldn't read it again. because we had to read it I finished it otherwise I should have stopped after the first chapter. if you read one page Holden said about 20 times ""the damn"" and that bothered me a lot. something else I didn't like about the way it was written was that the writer wrote like the way they said it.By example: Ya lost them, Ya mean and sonuvabitch, and that was in a way confusing. the books gets better after the lost chapters when he goes home and spends some time with his sister. the book is easy to read, there are only a few difficult words in it and that's a big advantage. conclusion: I didn't like the book very much."
3,The Catcher in the Rye,"If you like hidden humor, sarcasm, and negativity then you'll love The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. It is about a troubled boy named Holden Caulfield who had gotten kicked out of bording school. He had gotten kicked out of numerous schools before this, so he knew his parents would be pretty mad at him. Most of the book is about Holden's travel back to his house in New York City from his bording school in Pennsylvania. You learn a lot about him on his travel home. You learn his thoughts and outlooks on life, god, and society. I like this book because I enjoy hearing people's opinion on things like life and society. Sometimes Holden gets off topic when he is talking to you. If you don't like when people do this, then you shouldn't read this book because he does it a lot. That is the only bad thing about this book, and I suggest you read it."
5,Salinger Starts to Fade,"In reaction to other reader's comments I must comment how amazing it is that someone can read a book and not understand it. What Salinger does with ""Catcher"" is create a teen-ager who is in a state in his life where he doesn't understand what's going on around him and that he loves people so much, he hates them. How hard is it to understand people? Well, I guess the reactions people have to this novel is a great way to find-out what their insights are on others.... Take ""Catcher in the Rye"" with a grain of salt and take Salinger with some bourbon. Forget about the freaky old man and listen to what he has to say. There was a lot of insight in his head. A LOT of it."
5,A BAG OF EMOTIONS WITH FUN,"This famous book has captured many hearts especially young ones because its is so realistic and satisifies what you expect out of a struggling teen's life with a lot of insight. It is easy to compare to the main character because it clicks after every chapter the message and humor. It is funny in all the right places and random too, but it is also filled with expressions. This great book should be on anyone's read list."
5,The ultimate in period piece literature for the 1950s,"Looking for a timeless classic that won't disappoint? Tired of buying books on the bestseller list and then wondering how they got there? Fear not, for there's always Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" to keep you afloat.Wry wit, humor, psychological darkness lurking underneath, and a bevy of insight, you simply can't go wrong with this one. My classes all have read it, and they must have excellent taste as they keep coming back for my lectures!A fine American classic."
4,(4.5) GREAT BOOK FOR TEENAGERS,"This is just a great book, excellent for everybody to read even if you do not like to. Every youngster can identify himself with Holden. It is just one of those books everybody has to read.Wonderful.Must Read......"
4,Smooth and emotional,"What Holden Caulfield was able to tell me, was not the foul language appearance on every other line throughout the whole book, nor his stereotypical tone of a cynical adolescent or the monologue, and all 277 pages of them, but a normal teenager's sense of lost in his direction though he knew his New York city like the backyard of his house, his well concealed emotion for being a full grown man though he wept when he was exhausted, hungry and given all the ""dough"" his little sister had, the eight dollars and sixty five cents and all, more so, his love towards his passed Allie, brother D.B. and his ""old little Phoebe"". All this boy soaked with sensitivity top down was presented in front of me, foul yet as a innocent complete, that just ""killed me"", and it really did."
2,Completely Overrated,"This is a horrid ""novel,"" and I have no idea why it's acclaimed as a great piece of work. Although the idea of ""coming of age"" can be treated with skill and grace, this book fails to do so. I'll tell you why: the writing is awful. This isn't skillful writing, this is ranting. Reading the book was absolutely painful. It was cliche after cliche, and I wanted to run screaming away from the book and into the arms of Shakespeare, Pope, Dryden - just to feel like the English language hasn't entirely deteriorated. In the scope of things, this novel does not deserve to be taught in schools.If you would like to read a WELL-WRITTEN, worthwhile, complex, poignant piece of writing about ""coming of age,"" please read ""The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" by James Joyce. Please."
1,Holden is very abnormal,This book was pathetic and very unreasonable. Not every teenager is like Holden so I really can't relate to the book. A seventeen year old student generally does not wonder off to the city especially in 1945.
1,I hate this book,"I don't know why everyone tells you to read this book, IT SUCKED HUGE. The whole story was pointless, it should definatley not be listed as a classic anywhere. Holden is a spoiled brat who doesn't know a good thing when he has it. He reminds me of my little bratty sister, that just deserves a big slap in the face"
4,Fine book!,"This is really a nice book,I've read this book when I was 18 and I liked it very much.Who can give me info (websites etc.) about Salinger?"
1,An Overall Letdown,"My summer assignment for school was reading this book. Not only did I not enjoy the book, I thought its overall meaning was ridiculous.First of all, I can read sad stories. But the book constantly depresses you. I found the ""vernacular"" in the book annoying and nothing ever happened right.I highly disagree with the ""beauty"" and ""heartbreaking imagery"" in the book. The book was phony. I don't believe the story is universal at all. Not many people I know walked around New York city with symptoms of schizophrenia at the age of seventeen. It sure does not define my life. I do not think that is a great way to be initiated into adulthood. It sure does not tell the coming of age story for people I would like to know or meet in my lifetime.There are many great and fantastic American literary masterpieces out there.Read one of those."
1,This is a classic?!,"I absolutely hated this book. There is no plot. At all. I've heard it's supposed to be a great coming-of-age story, but to me, it didn't seem like the main character changed at all. Holden Caulfield remains annoying, whiny, and obsessed with cussing and the word ""phony"". If I hadn't been graded on reading it, I wouldn't have even read past the first few pages. Personally, I can't understand how this book ever got to be a classic."
1,Obviously part of the minority,"While this may be considered a literary classic, I never could get interested in the story or the characters. I finished it, but can't say I enjoyed the read."
2,Who Knew?,"Teenagers have angxt. Who knew? I read it in high school and thought, ""yeah, so?"" I read it again when my son was in high school and STILL thought, ""Yeah, so?"""
1,Throw Away The Catcher In Rye,"All I can say is wow, there's two hours of my life I will never get back. I was assigned to read this book in high school and everyone in my class hated this book. I've read most of the classics and loved them all but this was just a horribly pointless book. Holden is basically a rich emo kid stuck in 1945. All he did was roam around New York city, talking to stupid people, tried and horribly failed at picking up chicks, got drunk, smoked and then crashed at a closeted homosexual's apartment, because he was too afraid to tell Mommy and Daddy he had been expelled for the 3rd or 4th time. I seriously wanted to rip this book up and throw it in the trash, if it hadn't been a school assigned book. What was with his constant crying? I half expected him to be cutting his wrists and writing a suicide note. He should be on Gossip Girl, not making teens read about his poor rich life."
5,If a body catch a body...,"I just finished the book about two minutes ago and I still love it. No, Holden isn't perfect or anything, he's not a hero, maybe he does even have a little of that 'phony' in him, I don't know. But I just get really angry at reviewers who go on and on about how Holden's such a hypocrite, about how he's needlessly angsty or whatever. Don't they get that this is LIFE? The point isn't to end the book with some message of goodness, of joyful exuberance. It's so, so so so REAL and I just can't get over it. Holden's thing with wanting to protect his sister, and thinking everyone's a phony and punching Stradlater, it's really defining. He's just trapped, and he doesn't know what to do, it's like he's drowning.Really I think the book's greatest strength is that it's honest. Holden's really incredibly honest and maybe he's not RIGHT all the time, he is really melancholy, but he's honest. It killed me."
4,20th Century Classic,I have read this book several times throughout the years and also have given many copies to friends. Salinger did not want reviews on his book. So no more comments. Just read it.
4,No I Didn't Read This Book In High School,"It must be a very North American thing to have to read this book for school. In Australia it isn't part of the syllabus. Maybe it should be. I work in abookstore and I read 'Catcher In The Rye' because of all the hype and fuss surrounding it.Now, having read the novel, I agree that it is very good. I don't believe it is life changing or a masterpiece, but simply a challenging novel that has legions of fans (a cult following, perhaps?) because it tells it like it is. Teens on the rampage! Holden Caulfield is truly an example to us all. Do it all do it now do it your way!Read and Enjoy!"
5,This mirror dosen't seem to reflect so much crisis to me...,"I am sure you have heard the same story...forced to read ""Catcher in the Rye"" for a class assignment. Well, here I am two years after reading it for the first time, and I am doing yet another report, but this time by choice. I decided to read some of other reviewer's opinions and I was automatically reminded of what an excellent piece of literature we all have at our finger tips. J.D. Salinger has presented us with a piece of what I would call a semi-relatable novel, (at minimum). I can think of nothing more intriguing than being in the head of a cynical, wry, and egocentric 16 year old boy. Which is precisely why this is my favorite book."
3,it's okay...,"I never read this in high school, when everyone else is forced to. Would I have liked it better then? I don't know. Salinger does a fine job of characterization, and keeps the voice consistent throughout the story, but there's no plot, the sense of setting is actually pretty weak, and in general it feels more like an overgrown short story than a novel."
1,This is not the spanish edition,"Could you change the title of this item becouse is not the spanish edition, Thanks"
1,Just a spoiled brat doing a lot of whinging about nothing,"Holden Caulfield is just a puling spoiled rich brat whinging about a lot of kak. The biggest 'phony' in the book is Holden Caulfield. This book's popularity is due to it's protagonist's foul language, which is less pungent than mine was in High School."
3,Much Overrated,"At the risk of offending all the fans--this book should not have been banned because of the cursing or the sexual references. It should have been banned because it is uninteresting and tortuous to read. The sentences and the dialogue are so annoying they make me want to punch Holden Caulfield myself. I understand that was what the author was going for, but it doesn't make it any more palatable. I also understand that the novel was groundbreaking in its time. Regardless, I lost interest about 70 pages into the book and moved on. This is no classic."
5,The unknown future of Holden Caulfield,"JD Salinger wrote six stories for the New Yorker mentioning Holden Caulfield. Since the book began in 1941, I'm assuming the book took place around then - making his 1945 story, the last, true, and, ultimately, depressing as hell.Holden's brother, Vincent (or DB in the book, apparantly), narrates a very short story where he expresses disdain over Holden's being MIA. It's ultimately revealed that Holden Caulfield dies overseas, a mere four or five years after Catcher takes place.I don't know what's more depressing, that, or the fact that, in the book, the biggest phony of them all is Holden Caulfield."
5,the most frightening and beautiful text ever,"Salinger's 'Catcher in the Rye' is an amazingly frightening and beautiful text. It's more than a story of a troubled and psychologically disturbed teenager, it's a beautiful emmotional-construction that captures the universal feeling of the individual in the face of the tragic. Consider the brilliant passages as Holden recalls his immeasurable fear while crossing the street as he feels himself slipping into a mental abyss, or the beautiful rage of his youth when he breaks his hands beating his fists against the windows of his garage when his brother dies of leukemia. Catcher in the rye is about the fantastic horror and beauty of humanity in the face of the tragedies and uncertanties of life and a holy rage against the coldness and indifference of the ugly individual. This is not a book that can be understood by the brain."
3,Insanity?,"Sarcasm. Blunt profanity. Endless streams of ridicule. These are the three main things that spout continuously from Holden Caulfield's mouth throughout the course of J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"". Holden is a boy who always manages to bring out the negativity in even the most positive situations. Despite being an outcast from his friends and family, he dwells on his misfortune rather than changing his perspective on life. ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a cut-and-dry journey through the mind and life of a boy who deals with the difficulties of being a teengager, but somehow manages to find happiness in the end. I wouldn't call it a must-read, but I enjoyed it somewhat."
4,This book is great but does have a few boring parts,The Catcher and the rye is a really good book it's very interesting at first but then it starts getting boring. Then it gets better. This is a great book to read it makes you feel what Holden is feeling because it describes his fellings so well. I will warn you that some parts our pretty dull because it stresses the point to far quite a bit.
5,can never read it too many times,"i have never been so into a book from the get go, to the end, as i always am when i read this. going through some similar things myself at one point or another, or knowing people who did, really impacts me. i don't want to spoil the book, but i'll just say one thing. ""get it"""
3,"I think this book will grow on me, I really do","I am glad I finally caught up with this book. At 53, it was about time.I didn't rate it highly but I suspect it's one of those books that will grow in stature as I think about it. Lots of books we forget about as soon as we finish them. Some great ones live on.When was this book written? 1949.Well, I imagine it was ground-breaking then and a bit risque.The language flows like it could have been written yesterday - with the exception of the odd word such as ""gay"", meaning happy, and ""flit"" meaning homosexual.Salinger has captured the voice of a teenager brilliantly. Nothing much has changed in 60 odd years. His first-person main character is angry, confused, hyper critical, exaggerating and searching for a place in the world.The plot is what I call linear. No twists, no turns, the story never folding back on itself.That disappointed me but perhaps the story will continue to play out in my mind.(less)"
3,Julie's Review of TCITR,"I was very impressed with the book. I thought Salinger did an excellent job of writing such a detailed three day excursion in just 214 days. Of all of the books I've had to read in my high school career, I've only completed three books, and this being one of them. The book was written in such an irregular way, and that's why I think I enjoyed it so much. Catcher wasn't grammatically put together. I would reccomend this book to people, but only if they can handle going from one scene to the next in a few short words. The only part I didn't like so much was the ending, because the novel just ends abruptly. I guess that can be a good thing too, because it leaves it up to the imagination as to what happens to Holden."
4,The catcher in the rye,"The way the book starts, it grabs your attation, at least it did to mine. You get so in to the book you forget all about how much you have to reed for your english class. If you have not read this book go, go now and read it. Some of the thing the authr talks about is how teens handles their problems.so go go now and read the book.thanks for reading"
4,"This is a great . A little depressing at times, but great.","I read the Catcher in the Rye, and I thought it was great. I did get the impression that Holden was angry at everything and everyone, but most teens are. He was an incredibly well-written character, and I loooved the book."
4,interesting,"The Catcher in the Rye was 'interesting' for lack of better words. I read it in three days and was quite intrigued. it got my attention. but i don't feel that it improved my vocabulary or intelect in any way. That's what a good book should do. When I read it, I didn't feel like I was reading 'The Catcher in the Rye', from all I'd heard of it. I thought I'd be at least a bIt hard to understand. Ironically,it reminded me of this boy I know who lives up the street from me and that distracted me."
2,Maybe I don't get it...,"I read this twice, the first time expecting it to be the greatest book ever, the second without all the expectations and just for a good read. Both times I was disappointed. Don't understand why a kid with a bad attitude makes for such a popular book. By page 50, he had me mad at everything. Maybe I'm shallow, but I don't understand the world's love affair with Holden Caulifield, nor anything he represents. Sorry."
5,Best Ever Written,"Holden Caulfield was the best character in any book ever written. J.D. Salinger did an excellent job at catching the reader's eye by making Holden's expierences worth reading. If you only read one book in your life, be sure to read this one."
2,A page turner,"The best I can say of the book is that I could not put it down after I began reading it. Niether could I relate to the character, Caulfield nor did he seem like a very likable person. It was just interesting to see the world through a cynical teenager's eye. Sometimes he does make sense when he wonders at the pretense in our society, but mostly he just comes across as a self -centered, spoilt teen."
1,Highly overrated,"I must say that this is one of the most pointless books I have ever read. It seems to appeal to the ""typical teenager"" who thinks the world is full of hypocrites. The book itself holds no redeeming qualities at all and served no purpose except to waste my time."
1,a major disappointment,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. Aside from having no real plot or character development, this was probably the WORST book I have ever read. The story is completely repetitive, it goes like this: Holden Caulfield goes out and does something stupid, complains about it, then goes out and does some other stupid thing. I never once sympathized with Holden because all his failures were HIS OWN FAULT!! I am a 16 year old male, and this was the worst book I ever read."
4,Everything is a phony,"This book is one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. It is about a seventeen-year-old boy named Holden Caufield that is expelled from Pencey Prep. He doesn't want to tell his parents that he was kicked out of school and goes to New York City to spend a couple of days. Here he has a lot of adventures. Holden is a boy that thinks that everything is phony, he seems to hate everything, sometimes gets depressed, and is a terrible compulsive lyer. This book is mostly for teenagers, and talks about a lot of real issues that many people face in the world; it is also very easy to read."
2,The Catcher in the Rye,"The Catcher in the Rye is one of those books that can easily be over analyzed, but is never understood. Some see that as part of its intrigue, but I simply find it ridiculous. The Catcher in the Rye, while not a horrible book by any means, does not live up to its widespread fame and appeal. It is a staple on school reading lists and is considered to be a ""must-read"" for all educated people. Why? Good question.I've come across many people who claim to love The Catcher in the Rye, who say that it is full of deeper meaning and symbolism. Unfortunetly, when I ask them to elaborate and explain what it means, there is silence. I think that a lot of people say that they like the Catcher in the Rye because that's what you are supposed to say - you're supposed to like it. I just don't see what its appeal is."
1,The story of a tedious nobody doing nothing,"The story of a haughty, aimless, irresponsible teenager wandering around for a couple days, doing nothing of importance: thoroughly uninteresting. I don't see why people like this book -- it's just ""Hey, look at the antics of this stupid kid!"" I suppose the traditional answer is that it reminds many people of themselves (it didn't for me -- I was always quite down to earth, perhaps too much sometimes), but what would make such reminiscing about ephemeral, meaningless, and unimportant stupidity enjoyable to someone? I don't get it. Alternately, maybe they empathize with Holden Caulfield, but I could muster up no such empathy when I read this at 16 or 17.This book was obviously successful, so it must have done something for lots of people. It did nothing for me."
1,Toss it in the rye,This over-hyped collection of words drags the reader through the mind of a confused adolescent with tapestry generally reserved for a low brow detective story featuring the obligatory out-of-luck private investigator. The narrative presentation is as phony as the opining of the central character. No doubt the only reason this book became a popular classic is because of society's willingness to proclaim the wares of Art and Literature to be avant-garde simply for being outrageous or gross without consideration of intrinsic beauty or meaning. Escape the herd and shun the elitist dupes.
1,Awful,"Considering the praise this book has gotten I was suprised to find myself struggling not to toss this book in my fireplace. Holden Caulfield is a spoiled, whiny, brat who can find no good in the world. He sterotypes everyone and can't stop complaining about ""phony"" people. Please Holden is the king of ""phony"". Try to stay away from it if you can."
1,A Better Ending,"I am about 1/3 through this dreadful book, and I have stopped reading it and have decided to write my own ending.""I decided I'd had enough of this crumby world and all the phony people in it so I jumped off a bridge. The end.""There, saved myself a few more hours of drudgery. I don't believe this character is much like any normal human, more like one of those whackos who ends up getting some guns and shoots up a campus. His parents should have sent him to a military academy. The book itself has no plot. The hate and nihilism wears down one's soul. I have no idea why anyone thinks this is a great work of literature. And for the nimrod who thinks that people don't like this book because God says so, I'm an atheist and have no problem with bad language."
5,"Well written, Salinger captures Holden perfectly.","J.D. Salinger delveloped Holden wonderfully. Holden became a character any teenager could relate to. Holden became one of my friends throughout the book. Stream of conscience has always bored me until this book. I tried not to be too analytical, but Holden was easy to disect. He was thoughtful and intriguing. His hardcore attitude did not fully disguise his respect and interest in children. I admire Holden and could understand his points of view and his unreal justification for his actions. Overall, I loved this book. It's different and that is what makes The Catcher in the Rye spectacular!!"
1,BOR-ing!,"This is beyond doubt the most boring, inane, go-nowhere book I have ever read. Luckily I got it for $1.25 at a used book store. I like to give a book a chance, so I read to page 46, then couldn't stand it any more.I don't understand what the big hype is over this book. Was it ""cool"" back in the fifties to like it because of all the swear words?? I guess I just don't get it. It's going back to the bookstore where I got it!"
2,Pointless,"After reading this novel, I wonder what possesed me to finish it. The point of the story was virtually nonexistent. Salinger's supposedly great work is boring and unintelligent. Anyone who has a highly opinionated friend or sibling has already lived this story to some extent. If you are looking for a deep or meaningful novel, I suggest reading Brave New World, Walden Two, or anything by Chuck Palahniuk or Geroge Orwell instead."
1,Painfully overated...,"I cannot understand peoples' obsession with this book and its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Holden is a sniveling, spoiled brat, and I suspect the author's idolized self-portrait."
3,Old Hat,"Two days after my read (this was the first time iI read it since I was at Lafayette College in 1953), my sense was it was good back in the mid 20th century, but is ""old hat"" in the 21st. Salinger does use symbolism, however, to express those certain intangibles of the human heart and soul, back- in-the-day."
3,"Timeless themes, but the story itself falls a bit short","As a teenager, many of the things written by the protagonist are very relatable. While I was reading this book I imagined myself being transported into a simpler day and age, and learnt that the teenage themes and struggles highlighted in the book have remained steady for many decades which has heightened the popularity of this book. With that being said I was not compeletely satisfied with the novel on completion, feeling as though some key element or event was missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on."
2,so-so,"I know this book is a classic -- that's why I wanted to read it. It's very easy to read, but I did not get much enjoyment out of it. I understand Caulden has angst, but that's all the book was about?"
3,Okay Classic,"This book was a dense text. Tends to be somewhat comical with Holden's observations of the every day lives of people in NYC. Some what vulgar language, though. The comical spins Salinger puts on the subtle nuiances of society were funny. Not a very easy read, though as it is written from the point of view of Holden (entirely)."
3,"Interesting, but not as great as some may suggest.","I'm not one of those ""phonies"" who will complain about lack of plot and such in this book. The language that Holden uses is amazingly fresh, even today. It sounds just like the way I talked with friends as a kid (I'm 24). Still, I'm just not sure that accurately capturing the language and the emotions of youth is all that groundbreaking. This is a decent read, it will entertain you. But it won't change your life or anything. It actually reminds me a lot of books by Douglas Coupland (Generation X, Life After God, etc.). Except Coupland also deals with more interesting ideas."
2,Very over-rated,"I am of like mind with the reviewer who found ""Catcher in the Rye"" to be quite tedious, a novel with no plot, no character development, and very little value as a novel. I like my fiction to be stimulating, emotionally and intellectually; and entertaining, while also making a clear and worthwhile statement about the human condition. Recent novels like MOTHER OF PEARL, or MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, or THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY are far more to my taste. Obviously, ""Catcher in the Rye"" has proven to be of immense value to many people. I'm just not one of them."
2,Gawdawful Book...,"What can I say? I just finished reading this book, which had been hyped up beyond all belief. Anitclimax does not begin to cover what I feel. I think Salinger himself would be dismayed by all the Phonies, who say they like this book, just like they admired Lunts... Damn Phonies.. the lot of them"
2,Two Old Maybe?,"The entire time I was reading this book I was expecting the next page to become ""The Great Book"". It however failed me. I guess I may be too old or distant from my teenage years to fully understand Holden. (Wait, I am only 23.)I can however say it may have taught people lessons about life, especially young adults or it wouldn't of become this ""GREAT MASTERPIECE"" everyone has been talking about for fifty years.To me it was like phantom of the opera, although I really didn't want to read the book, I did, because it was supposed to be a great Literature Masterpiece. Maybe I should stop being a follower. I am wasting too much time.Two Stars because 1. I liked some of the dialouge and 2. It only took me three hours to read."
5,Goodly.,"I could really relate to the character in this book because...well I don't know but he's pretty realistic. So are the others in the book, especially those he views with some disdain. If you liked this and you are a girl you will probably also like The Bell Jar and Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk. Maybe."
3,The catcher in the rye,"I read this for the first time as an adult and I have to say that I was VERY disappointed. I did not understand what the big deal was although I have a theory. I think that if I had read this when I was younger, it would have probably had a greater impact one me because of the subject matter. I did not really enjoy this book but I am still glad I read it."
3,???,"This book was probably the most interesring book I have ever read in my 17 years of being on the planet. It was tear jerking, discusting, and best of all- Hilarious. But after I had finished the book, somebody asked me what it was about. I found mysely struggling to answer them and I finally said, I'm not sure. So I give Mr. Sallinger 3 Big stars for a great book. But please-- what is the point??"
2,Catcher in the Rye lost my attention,I have no i dea why this work is so popular; it is equivolent to a PG-13 movie about a teenager that lacks a plot.
5,Most Captivating Piece of Literature Ever Written,"I must have read and re-read this book 10 times, and each time I read it again it just gets better. What is more amazing is that the experience you gain from the book changes with age. I first read it as a freshman in high school, and now, being a sophomore in college, I pick up more things and interpret them differently than before. Important to understand while reading the book is that Salinger did NOT write it to describe today's ""rebellious"" youth. He was writing in a much different time, so many of his stereotypes don't apply to today. What hasn't chagned is the deeper meaning of the book."
5,This book should NOT be banned!,"In fact, I think kids should be forced to read it. This book portrays the negativity of community and how community is inclusive. Inclusiveness yields segregation and makes people think they have to have other people to survive and that they have to care what others think. He rejects this community, yet seeks it desparately throughout the novel. He is a sweet, sensitive kid--just like most kids this age. I have no idea why this book is forbidden. Society wants to make puppets of us all and I guess they do not want children to have brains of their own--or think that they can't think for themselves. It is beautiful. I am glad my teacher is cool and understanding enough to make me read it."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"Maybe I expected to much from his book. Lots of teenagers would easily relate to his trilas and tribulations, but I think the sense of the book would be lost to anyone who's past that phase in their life. I'm 21 and barely out of it and think Holden was a big phony. That's probably the reason why he was depressed so often."
5,The Catcher In The Rye is the most moving novel I have ever,The Catcher In The Rye is the intruiging story of a young boys search for identity and love in a world full of violence and hatred.
4,Good book,I really liked this book because I could relate to it. Many of the things that Holden had to deal with I could understand where he was coming from. Although it was only a span of three days it was a very interesting book to read.
2,I'm not a fan.,"The first 40 pages of this book are fine. Then, the dialogue becomes monotonous and boring. Holden says the same thing over and over again. It's always ""old Pheobe"" or something. Everything is ""old."" He cusses when he doesn't need to."
4,Those Goddamn Phonies!,"I'm 29 and finally picked up Catcher in the Rye. I sort of read it in grade school, but at that age the story line didn't have much meaning to me, and I didn't understand what was going on.This book may be controversial for it's time but I really don't see the big deal now. Sure he says ""Goddamn"" a lot and there's a bit of sex talk going on, but that's about it. PG 13 at the most.Holden gets kicked out of high school and our story begins with him telling us his last days of school and returning home. The time frame of the book is only 2 or 3 days. Holden believes everyone is ""phony"" with the exception of a few people he actually likes.I enjoy this theme of finding ways to cope with the ""phonies"" of the world. I'm a big Kurt Vonnegut fan and this theme is often covered in his books. ""and so it goes""Anyways, I don't know if I would consider this a classic, but it's a good book for sure."
3,Very annoying but fairly entertaining,"This wasn't a great book or a horrible book just ok the character was very repetive and just very unlikeable always saying ""this one is phony and that one is phony"" just the most unlikeable character i've ever encountered in my life of reading. And everything depressed this guy did they not have anti-depressents in those days.There are a few good things about the book i enjoyed the frequent though misspelled usage of goddamn was a riot and the way the writer captured middle of the century new york accents was cool and the relationship between holden and his sister was also a nice bit but came way too late in the story to make up for the horribly written character."
1,"If -5 stars was an option, I would have picked it.","I don't know, maybe it's just me, maybe I missed something, but I thought this was the most pointless, boring, and redundant book I ever read. There was no climax; there was no meaning. The supposed ""conflict"" was non-existent. Just heed my advice: Don't read the book. Heck, even if you do, I'm sure you'll throw it out after the first 10 pages."
1,this book was a peice of dung,This book wansn't that bad. the story couldn't have been better. I was described as if Holden was talking to you. I think J. D. Salinger is a great author.
1,Gag me with a spoon,This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It's full of complaints and Holden doing stupid things. Reading it a waste of time. It will put you in a nasty mood and make you feel like there's less to life than you originally thought. It was reccommended to me by a teacher and I was ready to slap her when I finished the book. I can't find justification for it being called a classic.
1,Awful book,"I'd give it no stars, but that's not an option. For me, the book was simply about a whiny teenage brat. I'm a teen, and maybe I'm just weird, but it was one of the worst books I've ever read."
2,Overrated Piece Of American Lit.,"Catcher in the Rye was an enjoyable and worthwhile read, but everyone's enormous praise for this book made it a huge letdown. It's very preachy and the points it makes are misplaced.Holden, the main character, is extremely cynical, sometimes understandable, sometimes not, and is yellow.With all of the people who have fallen in love with this book over the years, it makes me wonder if there is something wrong with them, or something wrong with me."
2,Nothing Happens,"Nothing really happens...the beginning of the book is very interesting, the way it is written attracts you to read more and more and you are really looking forward to what would happen next. One third into the book, it hits you that nothing is changing, it is basically not going anywhere, and the situation keeps on repeating itself. The interesting personalities disappear, and it turns to be just a normal story not really headed to any conclusion...The last third is just continuing the New York adventure, just in detail how the night develops, and wondering would this night ever ends...Anyway, some situations could be funny reading the book in the right mood, but if you have time to read, I would seriously re-consider."
1,This book is pure crap! Pointless!,"Why is this rambling mess with no story whatsoever considered a classic? As I kept reading this steaming pile of garbage, I kept expecting it to go somewhere. It went nowhere. Absoltuely nowhere. It involved characters that I could have cared less about and nobody was doing anything remotely interesting. It was almost like reading somebody's journal, a bunch of pointless entries. Somehow, this thing became a classic and I think everyone has jumped on the bandwagon and agrees that it is one just so that they can say that they have read a classic. If a mess like this can get published, there is hope for aspiring writers everywhere."
3,Plotless,"This book does have a plot, just a pointless one. I think I'm the only person on the planet who didn't like this book. I didn't see much of a reason for the writing of it, but is was a quick, engrossing read. I flew through this thing, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to read every word and follow every path the writer lead me through. However, in the end, I was very disappointed. There didn't seem to be any point to the story at all. Whatever, it was fun to read and I give it 3 stars just because of that."
2,If a body catch a body...,"As one of the ""great books"", and one that a former consumer I worked with listed as her favorite, I felt a certain obligation to read <em>Catcher</em>, at least once.Alienation? You betcha.Amazing insight on the part of the Narrator? No.Interesting insight on the part of the author, into cynical teenage angst? Somewhat.I didn't particularly enjoy reading Catcher, nor did I see, at the time, what the ""greatness"" that was supposed to be mined from the pages. Reflecting on it now I can begin to see a little of it. Perhaps this is one of those books that was meant to be read and discussed as a group, rather than consumed in a solitary mode."
1,I don't get all the fuss!,"This book has been referred to as a great American novel by well respected reviewers. What, slow day in Literary Land? I really, really didn't like this book. I really, really didn't like Holden. I really, really don't get all the fuss about the coming of age message, the teen angst, etc. Glad I got through it so I can read a GOOD book!"
1,First World Problems,"When Catcher in the Rye came out it was something of revolution. Never before had anyone took time to explore the mind or problems of the over-privileged, white, American teenager. It is an esoteric novel, a low brow piece of literature that sells to its particular crowd: people who haven't read much, or experienced actual life beyond the age of twenty. Now, it's not necessarily the worst thing I've read, but the acclamations people have given it are beyond absurd. Only a fool could identify with Holden Caulfield. This book is basically the 'Twilight' of its day. The only reason it's regarded as a classic is because enough time has passed. Somehow the imagery of an era gone by is enough to cement itself as something of a must read. But you don't need to read it. The story is very simple. It's about an angry white kid, who travels across the city, and finds out that there's more to life than his incessant, introspective whining...and of course there is."
3,Severely dated,"Although the book and the author have been lionized over the years, unfortunately the book does not bear up well under the pressure of years. The numerous apologetic tics of Holden, such as the use of ""old"" as a term of affection for anyone and everyone, wears and grates, eventually ruining this reader's nostalgic memory of the book as read in an earlier time. The swearing gets in the way, too. No, the book should not be banned, but it would definitely have benefited from extensive editing. Holden is obviously a candidate for analysis."
3,Very few space battle scenes,"I confess to some disappointment with this book, though I should mention that I did appreciate the scene where Europa, a moon of Jupiter, collides with an asteroid. But the purpose of the space exploration chapters is a bit of a mystery to me, as much as I enjoyed them. How does this jibe with the prep-school coming-of-age theme in the earlier chapters? Perhaps my copy had some printing errors."
3,Wow quite overrated...,"I just wanted to mention that I've read this book twice and I fail to see what's so ""classic"" about it. I mean it isn't a bad book by any means, but come on. There just is nothing extraordinary about it, besides maybe the fact that there's swearing in a book from the 50s/60s. Just another overhyped piece of ""modern art""."
1,I Was Misinformed,"""The Catcher In The Rye"" had always been shorthanded to me as a classic ""coming of age"" book, involving teenage angst and alienation. (It is, perhaps, a ""classic"" in the sense that Britney Spears is a ""star."") Having recently read the book for the first time, I discovered (regrettably, too late) that I had been misinformed. It is not at all about a young man coming of age, beset by archetypical teenage angst and alienation; it is about mental illness. I also suspect it is autobiographical, and so do not blame Mr. Salinger for the book's lamentable lack of any literary merit. I fear, rather, that in the writing of it he simply could not help himself."
5,outstanding!,"I know this book is, for the most part, universally liked, so I will make only one point. I recomend everyone reads it, but especially late teen and early twenties males such as myself. I read the book when I was 19. Never before in my life have I indentified with a novel like Catcher in the Rye. You feel as though Holden thinks your thoughts. This book gives an indepth account about comming to age in a modern world and the difficulties you encounter in discovering who your are."
4,Great book for those who don't like to read,"I think that this book is cool. It helps you understand what might come up in your life. It helps you understand temptation. It's a bad book. My teacher told me I had to explain that ""bad"" means ""good"". Thanks old Mr. Spencer (Holden's history teacher)."
1,"Over-hyped, and yes i've read it more than once.","I read it in high school, didn't do anything for me. Reread it recently cuz everyone says it's awesome. And I'm disappointed. Guess what, we're all phonies according to Holden, and that's because we aren't Allie, Phoebe, or under ten years old."
1,This guy needs to get out more.......,"What a load of over-hyped rubbish.The main character seems to just have a problem with everything. I can't believe I read the whole book, I was waiting for it to get good then, all of a sudden, it was finished ! Some people need to wake up and smell the coffee and this guy's one of them."
3,Key to the male mindset,"When I first began reading this book, I didn't understand Holden's viewpoint or why he said and did the things he did. About midway through the book, I discussed it with my one of my male friends, who informed me that to truly understand where he was coming from, it helped to be male, but that it might help to try and read it from the male perspective. Suddenly, everything guys had ever done that didn't make sense started to make sense. My advice to girls who read it and are puzzled: Try reading it from a male viewpoint. All the things that teen boys do will cease to be completely irrational."
5,descriptive as hell....,"""Catcher in the rye"" is one of my favorite books. One of the reasons is because it is ""descriptive as hell"" (If you read it you would understand the meaning of my title..) If you are one of those psychos like me..Holden makes you feel like your not alone..And that there are other people in the world just as ""unique"" as you..."
3,Not a masterpiece,"They say that either you rave about this book or you simply discard it with a shrug, but I found that my feelings regarding it was somewhere in the middle. Brilliant in portions, contrived in some, this book does well to bring out the confused thought processes of an errant disillusioned teenager, and his love for his sister. The character development is too contrived in some parts, and very subtle and beautiful on some occasions. It would've been a masterpiece if the author hadn't gone out of his way to eulogise the protagonist's character, sometimes unduly, to forcefully justify his disillusionment."
1,"A plotless, ""anti-hero"" story -- read Atlas Shrugged by Rand","This book is not worth the paper on which it is printed. Throughout the book, Holden, the main character, wanders purposelessly in thought and action, indifferent and cynical to the world around him -- the typical ""anti-hero."" The reader is given a negative look at humanity, not for the purpose of correcting the worst in people, but for reveling in it.For an uplifting view of man, I suggest the masterpiece novel by Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged. Miss Rand presents man as a heroic being who is capable of dealing with reality. Although one may look at Atlas Shrugged and cringe (it is 1100 pages), one will be wishing for more by the end."
1,Don't understand the hype for this awful book,"I would likely have given this book two or three stars if it weren't for all the hoopla about how amazing this book is. It's touted as a classic and raved about. But, I find it rather ordinary.While the author captures the persona of his teen hero, it feels like that's becaues the author isn't much more than an overgrown child himself.I don't find this book in the least bit insightful. And the story borders on boring. I was so looking forward to finally reading this...and I was so deeply disappointed by it. Just a lot of rot."
1,Catcher in the Rye,"I simply cannot understand why people rate this book anything above a one star. The only point that is ok about this book are the symbolic themes, which could have been much better expressed. Besides the swear words, the vocabulary is below 5th grade and the author repeats ""phony"" every other sentence. The main character is flat and so are his views of the world. I guess the title has a little meaning behind it once you finish the book but this theme is poorly executed. One of my friends read this book and recommended it to me - I guess he just hasn't read any good books yet."
1,Book is a paperback rebound in a hardcover.,This item is a rebound mass-paperback version. If you want larger print and the higher quality paper you typically find with a Hardcover make sure you check the dimensions in the description.
2,Hype in the Rye,"Growing up in Boarding school, reading Catcher in the Rye, whilst moping about the fields secretly smoking cigarettes and feeling quite misunderstood was a standard thing to do. I have always wanted to read this book, but never got round to it until now. May be I would have understood the trials and tribulations, of coming from a wealthy family and having the opportunity to be educated in style, back in the days, but now that I am older and more disillusioned, I can merely consider the protagonist as a victim of teenage angst. Caulfield; take a Prozac and grow up!A one book wonder"
2,Overrated angst,"I found this book incredibly dull. I gave it two stars instead of one because even though it is very dull to read I get what Salinger was trying to do. This is a book about a mentally disturbed boy as he would seriously write it as a long self indulgent inner monologue. If you want to read some good Salinger I recommend Franny and Zooey and most of Nine Stories. But avoid Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction it is even duller than Catcher in the Rye."
5,My FAVORITE Book,"This book is the best book I have ever read. I wish I could write a book like this. Many people may feel that a lack of plot makes this book weak. I, however, believe that this gives The Catcher in the Rye a quality not often found in books. While reading this book, I could not stop myself from feeling sorry for Holden, I could almost see myself in his position. I have never wanted to write a review before, but I had to after reading this book. Besides To Kill a Mockingbird, this is the only book I have not hated my English teacher for making me read."
2,dated and vacous,"perhaps a novel which is too much viewed through rose coloured lenses. although well enough written i have always found the story to be somewhat absent. an uninteresting mildly nihilistic character, meanders through a brief and uninteresting plot. leaves me cold."
3,Catcher Review,"The Catcher in the Rye in written by J.D Salinger. It is about Holden, an 16 years old boy, who talks in a very sarcastic way about his childhood, his growing up, his school life and his sexlife which doesen't exist. The book is written in talking speech, the narrator uses simple language, so it's easy to understand. The narrator exagerates often to make the ""problems"" of the adolescents understandable. First the story is very depressing, because you only see Holden's problems and there seems to be no way out of this darkness..but wait until the end..I like the book and I dislike it: I felt depressed when I started reading it and bored, but then I began to think about all these problems and so on. It had a positive effect towards my life, because I started thinking about my way to live and now I'm persuaded that you can do something good with your life, if you really want to..."
5,Cather and the Rye,"I read this book as part as my work for school. You would think a teacher might have to tell her students to read the book, but our class read in the middle os a lesson and she would tell them to put it down. She couldn't believe what she was saying. My class took this book apart, we looked at symbolism and why Holden acted that way. We read this book because it went with are theme. Are born evil or we made evil? J.D. Salinger answered that question. Holden was a product of his enviroment. This was an excellent book. I would recommend this book for anyone."
1,Inspired Me to Action I Couldn't Take,"This book made me want to murder John Lennon. After a quick google search, I found that some rapscallion had beaten me to the punch. Do not recommend if you are easily frustrated."
2,hopefully won't be a classic for long,"This so called classic is the most uneventfull, uninspiring, and repetetive book I have ever read. If you take out Holden Caulfield's complaining, you may have 5 good pages of material. As I started reading this book, after about 25 pages I thought it would get better once the story started, but lo and behold... there is no story.Ok, heres a summary, for all potential readers. A troubled teen fails out of school-complaining-, goes into New York city-complains. Thinks about calling a few people-complains. Gets a prostatute, talks to her for a couple of minutes-complains. She leaves-complains some more. Gets in a fight-complains a little. Goes to a bar-complains. Goes on a date with an old friend-complains. Goes to another bar-complains, and so on and so forth.This story is definately not worth reading, though I have several friends that liked it, I definately wouldn't recommend it to anyone that wants a good read."
2,"Good style, but over-rated","I'll admit, I enjoyed the style in which this story was written. He talks with slang, cuss words, uses street talk, and his prose is a good representation of the way people spoke in the late '40s and early '50s.However, what was the point to this book? Throughout the book, Caufield complains, whines, and tells the reader how much he hates life, the adult world, and everything else. He's very negative, very pessimistic, and is always cynical of society. He can't cope with his environment, can't adapt to the real world, and thus isolates himself and pretends he is above everybody else.The book has no conclusion either. .. No conclusion, little hope, and an abrupt end to a pointless book. If Holden Caufield hated life so much, why didn't he shoot himself and save my time, and the time of millions of other people?Kevin"
2,Not for anyone with real angst,"Catcher in the Rye is the most overrated book I have ever read (and I have read many). Holden Caulfield is 100% unoriginal and phony and symbolizes the concept known as the ""White Man's Burden"". Holden is the origin of all of his 'suffering'. He also symbolizes the hypocrisy of priviledged people (perhaps Salinger's intent). I give this book 2 stars for the simple fact that it could fool so many people for so many years. If you are interested in reading this book because it is 'the voice of your generation', then think again. Anyone, especially teenagers, who are suffering from actual anguish and emotional pain shouldn't waste your time reading this book because it will only annoy you."
2,This book stinks. Or something. I don't know.,"I picked up this book because I grew up hearing it's title, which always intrigued me. It is written in the style of a wishy-washy 16-year old, this is the ONLY reason I give this book two stars. Salinger caught the wishy-washiness of a teenager's viewpoint on life PERFECTLY, but this perfect portrayal of a mind without goals is exactly what makes this book a TEDIOUS READ. Caulfield, the main character, cannont commit to one sentence throughout the entire book without backing out of it a sentence later, with a ""or something,"" or a, ""if you want to know the truth,"" or another dated late 1940's cliche'. I dropped this book, and picked up Les Liaisons Dangereuses, which was written 220 years ago, and IT seemed less dated. Don't read this unless you are a student of 1940's America, and you like terms like ""I get a bang out of this,"" and, of course ""That crumby person is a real phoney."""
1,Drivel,"Sheer drivel, drivel, drivel, drivel, drivel, drivel. Did I say it was drivel? Perhaps an additional adjective...sheer perverse drivel drivel drivel. And that is two more words than required."
3,Kevin A a very good book that you should read.,"I enjoyed J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye I would reccomend it to any teenager, even if it takes place in the 50's Holden Caufield is still a very relateable person even to people growing up now. But what I did not like about it was that Holden seemed to complain as if noone else has every faced the same problems, even though they were'nt small and meaningless but there still not an uncommon thing. I don't really hate it but personally I don't like it. Overall I liked this book though, it was one of the first books I really ""read"" rather than reading it just for school."
4,Good Book,"The Catcher in the Rye begins at Pency Prep in Pennsylvania. Where a sixteen year old, Holden Caulfield, has gotten expelled out of his fourth school. After having a scuffle with his roomate, Holden decides to head home to New York three days early without letting his parents know he's home. Once in New York, Holden checks into a hotel room and wanders around the city. At the end of the book Holden writes his sister a note to meet him at the museum because he wants to tell her he's going to move out west. Holden didn't end up going."
5,Brilliant in it's simplicity,"I hate poetry because it doesn't get to the point like communication should. When I was assigned this book at school I spent time looking for some hidden meaning. I came to the conclusion that salinger was almost retarded when compared to vonnegut or C.S. lewis's complicated writings. After thinking about the book during the summer, I realized that this book wasn't trying to prove anything (even Salinger says that himself) it was just a simple book about life. I knew what Salinger wanted and why he wrote it that way."
5,wonderful and intreging,"Thhis book is amazing. It is about a boy named Holden Caufield and his journy through the life of a prep school. Salinger takes an unapealing bad boy and makes you intreged by him, even love him. You just keep wanting to learn more about this strange but lovable boy. When i finished this book, i almost missed Holden. I loved this book and strongly suggesst it to people of all ages."
5,Re-read this book,I decided to re-read this book. This may be the first book in 15 years that I decided to re-read - but I thought it was worth it (and it only takes a few hours to read). The Catcher in the Rye is a fantastic and inspiring book. I recently ran into a few people who never read the book. My question: why? Get the book right now and read.
4,Majin's book review,"I just finished reading the critically acclaimed book by J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye. I found the book easy to read and enjoyable. I think that people who fall into the age group of 17-25 can enjoy the book a lot more than most people, because I feel that they can relate to Holden. The book is a story about a couple of days in the life of Holden Caulfield, a boy who sees the world through different eyes. Holden is almost always depressed and we get to follow him from Penncey Prep School to New York City and we meet ""phonies"" all the way. Over all The Catcher in the Rye is a very enjoyable book and it is just as good as what I've heard about it."
4,What can I say? A classic,"Fist time I read Salinger (I'm from latin america, so it is not a ""classic"" there) and I found it amazing! I enjoyed it from beginning to end.."
4,Everybody Loves Holden,"Salinger is a genius. When I first heard of this novel and decided to read it for a class assignment, I was not thrilled. For one, the title sounds terrible, and, two, anything labeled as an American Literature classic usually means BORING. Well, I was terribly mistaken. This book truly is an American classic. From the first page to the last, you will be completely mesmermized by our hero, Holden. This book was written from the heart and the best way to describe it is that it is real. It is written in real language, with real feeling, emotion. It is about real life from the eyes of a teen. I would recommend this book to people of all ages who are looking for a good laugh, or just want to read a darn good book. Once you open the pages, Holden will become a part of you, and I guarantee you will enjoy it."
3,Boring.,"That's about it .... I read this when I was a teenager and I read it again later on, trying to figure out what exactly was supposed to be so great. Both times I was amazingly bored. With the character, with the whole plot or lack thereof, whatever. It's well written, it's a perfect portrait, but I just didn't care... sort of like the Basketball Diaries. Again, didn't really care, and that had lots of drugs in it to make it interesting.Everyone I know had a more interesting real life than these people. Maybe it's just the way it's described; if someone were really telling this story I'd be interested, but it's just so blandly written. It's like he took some great event and turned it into porridge.I just don't relate ... I must be some sort of freak. Three stars because I'm afraid someone would come beat me up if I gave it less, and after all I've read worse written books."
1,I HATED this book,"I will try to keep myself composed here, but I absolutely HATED this book. It was slow, had a terrible plot (or lack thereof), and bored the hell out of me.Holden Caulfield does NOT embody anything (like despair, cynicism, and realism as many people say), except for annoyance, and perhaps whininess. Seriously. Not only am I not sympathetic (or empathetic) with him, but I feel the urge to reach into the pages and slap the stuffing out of him.I think perhaps the worst part about the book is that its not even like Holden DOES anything. Hell, things dont even really happen TO him, either. He just drifts around, which would be fine if interesting things happened to him... but they dont. ..."
5,Everyone should read it,"I can't say too much about this book that hasn't already been said....I will say that if you haven't read it, you should drop everything and order it right now off of Amazon.com! Well anyways, the thing that sticks with me from ""Catcher in the Rye"" is how Caulfield strives not to be a phony."
2,Not my thing,"I was browsing around amazon for some of the top most rated books and this book was among them so I decided to give it a read. Towards the beginning the book seemed pointless but I carried on anyway, hoping that soon it would turn interesting but that never truly happened. I am a teenager and I didn't really enjoy this book. Maybe I am too young to understand the ""retaining child-like innocence"" message in this book. I wasn't very fond of the slangy language either."
1,this is a classic?,How this book ever got to be a classic is beyond me!! I read it all the way through because I'd heard of it for years. I kept thinking it would provide some lesson in life. I was sorry I ever read it!! I obviously missed the life lesson.
1,Extremely over rated,"I believe that works of art, be it sculpture, painting, music or literature are a product of their time. Those that are destined for greatness are rediscovered by sucessive generations with Michagelo, Van Gogh, Mozart, and Shakespeare as examples. Salinger's works in contrast, seems dated and aimed squarely at the angst of pampered American Baby-Boomers.Although I enjoyed this book as an adolescent, a recent re-reading of it made it seem self important and irrelevant. I actually wanted the main charecter to shut up and get over himself.I imagine Holden as a current day overweight, balding, middle manager working in MidTown, with and ex wife, drinking problem, large pharmacy bill, and chip on his shoulder caused by the world doing him wrong.To me, this novel has not stood that test of time that some other great works from the era such as Slaughter House 5, and Lord of the Flies have."
4,Make a little time for a classic,"So I've been on a ""classic book"" kick, deciding that with all of the reading I do, I should try to work in more well-known literary novels. The ones I should have been reading in HS or college. Catcher in the Rye was on my list this month.Interesting book...although not my favorite of all the ""classics"" I've read, it definitely left an impression. Amazing descriptives and it really puts you in the mindset of Holden Caulfield. And you might be shocked at what you feel/think about. It's easy to slip into this character and get lost in how he is feeling and who he is and what he's dealing with. A close look at a hard life. For those merits alone it's worthy of a Pulitzer in my opinion. (Although it notoriously did not win one.)It's an easy read, nothing to be intimidated by, and it's short at only 250 pages. What do you have to lose? I'd recommend it."
1,Difficult to read,"A recent magazine article on J.D. Salinger brought my mind to the book I read so many years ago and loved. I decided I wanted to read it again and have it for my ""favorites"" library. I purposely ordered what was labeled ""hard cover"" as I wanted it to last. When I received it, I found it to be unreadable. the letters and lines were incredibly close together making reading a chore rather than a pleasure. It is an important book and this printing and publishing of it doesn't measure up to its worth."
2,Almost ...,"The book was in good condition. I expected the classic ""red"" cover and did not receive it and was disappointed that it did not come as advertised."
3,An alright book.,"I never liked reading but for my standards this book was alright. I could sort of relate to it but, his situation is much more extreme. With him droping out of high school and me going for a college it was different. This book was a white trash love story which it made it somewhat interesting. Also I would look up Gene Autry Fan's review on this book and barf from the contradiction on his part and gave me a laugh."
5,For those with a functioning mind,"It takes a certain amount of personal struggle to understand and appreciate this novel. A mental health issue may also help. I am merely a 17-year-old, so possibly my opinion doesn't matter to you, but this book matters to me. Everyone is looking for someone to connect with, and Holden Caulfield has transcended his ""innocent"" era of the Fifties to speak to many a troubled teenager. And, no, not just to schizophrenics. His days alone with the world are the ultimate description of the most difficult stage of life. It is absolutely necessary for this to continue as mandatory reading, if only for those select few who will look past the ""goddamnits"" to see the true spirit of a boy struggling to grow up and still hold on to his childhood. Holden keeps his dead brother's baseball mitt; I keep my Barbie doll. What do you hold on to?"
5,It killed me,"Holden Caulfield is probably the most interesting character I've ever come accross. I think that everyone can see a little bit of themselves by peering into Holden's mind and seeing the seemingly small, insignificant things that ""kill"" him or depress him. The book was also surprisingly funny at times - I often caught myself laughing out loud."
3,"Not bad, but the book was no piece of art...","OK, art is not an easy concept to grasp, and you cannot explain it in a 1000 words. Better read Kant and his Critic of the Judgement. A book needs no plot to be good, it does not really need anything in particular. But Salinger made me feel like he was just trying to exercice himself with that stream of counsciousness thing. Its just like trying to write a book without any Es. It is interesting for a while but gets boring quite quickly. Yep, a definite average..."
4,It was pretty interesting.,"If you are a lover of good classic literrature, then you'll love, ""Catcher in the Rye""!"
5,one of the best...,Catcher is one of the best books I've ever read. Every teen should read it...they'd like it. Just sit down one day and read it. It goes by quickly... Happy Reading!
3,Not the best book I have ever read,"To begin with I must write that this isn't certainly the best book I have ever read. Sometimes it's boring, especially when Holden complaines all the time. However, I liked this guy. Especially his critical comments on all these fools around him. The fact that I can somehow relate to this guy is the best thing in this book."
5,All I have to say is....,"...that if you didn't like Catcher is the Rye, you're scared to admit Holden reminded YOU of YOURSELF.Holden is the atypical teenager. I know I saw alot of myself in Holden and Phoebe. Holden and Phoebe's relationship mirrors the relationship I have with my older brother. It's one of the very BEST books ever written."
2,"Pointless, Plotless..... !!","I expected The Catcher in the Rye to be an exciting book filled with many lessons and events, but to my disappointment, the novel followed no real plot line ... it was basically a pointless book. Holden Caulfield is just a rich little kid that takes everything for granted and thinks everything and everyone in this world is ""phony"". I think the only phony in this novel is Holden Caulfield himself. There's really not much else to say about The Catcher in the Rye... it's not as good as everyone makes it out ot be, and Holden Caulfield is a little twerp!"
2,Overrated,"When I picked up this book, I was looking forward to it immensely. I knew it was a classic, and a classic, by definition, is a book that has stood time. I found during and after reading it, that it's just a boy, telling you his thoughts. The swearing gets to be tired and completely unnecessary. The things that this boy does are repeatedly stupid and leads me to wonder why I would ever want to know his every thought. Don't expect a novel that you'll love to read/have read."
5,Grow Up Holden!,"I read this book for the first time when I was 15 years old. I thought that in Holden I had found my alter ego, my true self. I absolutely identified with Holden.I'm not 15 any more, in fact, I have three sons who are much closer to 15 than I will ever be again. I read Catcher again this summer, and I have only one thing to say. Please, please, please God, don't let my boys grow up to be as sef-absorbed and immature as Holden"
5,Catcher on the Rye Review,This book is very engaging. I had a hard time putting it down. I think many of us can relate or at least sympathize with Holden Caufield. At first whim the ending may seem lackadaisical but once you look back on the meaning of the book and its main character it makes more sense.
2,The Catcher in the Rye,"I thought the book was kind of dumb. It seemed to not really have a point, but drag on anyways. It might have been better if it was shorter because then it wouldn't be as drawn out. I also thought it was confusing."
1,It was just horrible,"It was just about a boring kids life. It was just one big introduction to a book, which is the worst part of a book."
1,utterly disappointing,"unless u would want to see the world from the eyes of ordinary 16 year old, it is a complete waste of time n money ... there's no depth in it and as u move on to chapters the story wears off disappointingly, n u would feel like reading a diary of some teenager ... u get nothing out of it really - to be honest i didnt even finish the book."
2,You laugh but at the same time you want to kill youself,"This book can be funny at parts but if you have to read it for school (I can say that hearing your teacher read parts of it will be entertaining.) I pity you because you can't throw it out the window and get rid of it. Dull and Pointless DO NOT read it if you can avoid it!--If you are looking for a book about a depressed teenager (that will not have you banging your head against the wall) I suggest ""It's Kind of a Funny Story."" That's a great book!"
1,Hand Me The Spork Already,"This is an overrated waste of ink. Honestly. I really think I could write a better novel about ""coming of age"" in my sleep. Maybe I will. But I digress.The main character, Holden Caulfield, is so one-dimensional it makes me want to gouge my eyes out with a spork. Really. He sees the world in a childish, cynical way more suited for a spoiled ten-year-old. He refers to everyone as phonies and bastards and uses a limited vocabulary to repeatedly rehash subjects that weren't interesting the first time around. I have nothing against J. D. Salinger; he only tired to write a book. What really gets under my skin is that such a book is considered a classic. It's a crying shame."
2,Possibly one of the Worst stories I have ever read,"This book was quite simplistic to read, so I gave it a star for that...but the story, or lack there, was awful. I am 15 years old and all I got out of this book is no wonder adults hate teenagers. The narrator, Holden Caulfield, complains throughout the story. Basically he is an umotivated rich kid obsessed with sex. Maybe I am an exception to the whole teenage thing, but I really could not relate to his view on the world. (If Holden met me, he would hate me I think)"
2,"It's there for you to read, but I won't pick it up again.","To Joseph Childs, previous reviewer, I couldn't have said it better myself. I, too, had not read this book until my 20s. And I, too, had thought I was missing something. But I echo your comments that this book was not great nor was it bad. It was just ho-hum. After I finished the book I wasn't enlightened, happy, sad, or anything on the spectrum of emotions that lie on either side of average. I probably yawned and said, ""well, done with that one.""Holden is one of those characters who represent people that I have never particularly cared for in life. In fact, people like him annoy me something fierce. But, as these reviews and history shows, there are a great number of people who can relate and who love this book. I only give it two stars, because it was just an average book for me. Even so, I would still recommend that it be read, because if these reviews are any indicator, chances are you'll probably like it."
3,aDolescent wails - The Catcher in the rye,"One of my colleague has this dark side gravity about him. We occasionally have a conversation about the litarary works around us. He often surprised me with this dark taste. He introduced me to 'Gloomy Sunday' - a deeply surrealistic yet captivating dark poem. Then oneday he told me the book ""The Catcher in the rye"" by one JD Salinger. I was sceptical but the deep and dark anxiety in him made me feel want to read the book just to understand what kind of book was this.I read it on the way to Colombo. Finished in the hotel. I was surprised by the flow of the story. This story had been something of a learning experience, although of the darker side of human being. Well written, deeply realistic and too darkly lit through out - as often it is the case in the times of an adolescent."
2,JRayTribe,"I recently read The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. I did not like this book at all. It should die. Slowly. I can see the significance of it, but it seems that Salinger has a swearing problem. I'm not sure but this book may have more swear words in it that Mark Twain's Huck Finn and n-words. All of the swearing is funny at first, but after a few, um paragraphs, it gets too annoying. I have two words for Mr. Salinger: Paperback version, page 201, second paragraph. It is what was written on the wall."
2,That's it?,"After hearing so much about this book, I expected at least a little more than a kid's three day spree in New York. Why do so many schools have students read this? It seems nothing more than a tale of very emotionally disturbed adolescent, and a perverted one at that. There must be about a dozen psychological terms to describe this kid, none of which are typical of the common teenager. It's books like this that give teenagers such a bad name, especially when they don't deserve it."
2,Highly over rated...poor exscuse for a classic,"I thought that J.D. Salinger was just trying to develop a ""shocker"" with this novel, and all I got from it was over abused language and poor writing. I understand that Salinger was portraying a ""madman's"" point of view yet I feel he could have made the character a little less repetitive and more intelligent"
2,Not quite what I thought.,"With all the good reviews, I thought this would be an excellent book to enjoy.I should have read the more mature reviews. Teens will probably enjoy thisbook as Holden, the main Character is very immature. People closer to his agewould probably be able to relate to him much more.So unfortunately I did not enjoy the book much.. I think the main problem is relating toHolden. I didn't find much within his character to relate to. Nothing he said ordid had any merit. He did not do anything in the book... just wandering aroundquite aimlessly. Causing heartbreak, annoyance and stress to people who love him and/orwant to help him.Overall though I thought it to be a disappointment... I'm glad I only paid $7 dollars for it."
4,An Essential Read!!!,"Holden Caulfield can really tap into many of the wacky thoughts we all must have had at one time or another. My only regret after reading this book, in one sitting mind you, is that I hadn't read it 8 years ago when I was 16 going through many similar and confusing trials in my own life. I can only imagine JD Salinger must have had quiet an experience during his adolescent years to be able to articulate them so well through the eyes of this character."
3,What's all the Rave about?,"Yes, this book is masterfully written and has all sorts of crazy metaphors and signals, but it's not a good story. I could explain to you the whole plot and it'd take me less than three sentences. If your looking for a book that you could pick apart word for word and spend a decade studying, then this is the one. If you're looking for a book to read and get a thrill or some knowledge out of, then I'd reconsider this book."
5,The Puzzle that is Holden,"A great read for any age, from 10th grade to adulthood. It really makes you remember or really helps you have a kind of camaraderie with Holden Caufield. It is a deceptive book that it only takes a glimpse of Holden's life over a few days in his life where a million memories of previous experiences adds up to where he is at 'today'. It is a book about finding oneself, about finding ones place and realizing that it isn't all about sticking to the norms and what society wants you to be."
2,big disappointment to me,"I had heard about this book for years. What a wonderful story it was supposed to be. I thought it was just slightly above childishly written and so full of vulgar language, (and I'm not prudish)it was difficult to really get interested. About 2/3rds of the way through, I got sick of it and never finished it. The seller shipped the book ""as agreed"" Save your money!!!!"
4,a life of our own,"Catcher in the Rye is the type of book that few people will understand. You will either love it or hate it, and it all depends on your state of mind. If you can identify with a character who feels out of place from society, who doesn't really have plans for the future, and who sometimes finds himself to be his own best friend, you will love this book. If you can't set your mind to think this way, you will either hate it, or respect the author's point of view, but not connect with it. Holden is more than a prep school drop-out, Holden is a generation. A generation that looks at society and says, ""Why can't it be different? Why do I have to follow these rules, or standards?"" Holden is ultimately a character who strives to gain a life much more simple than his own, a life that is much more of his liking, a life that many of us wish to have."
5,J.D. Salinger - - -Catcher of the Mind!,"Catcher in the Rye is one of the best books I have ever read. Holden is such a great character in this book, that you start to become him and act like him in your everyday life. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to find symbolism because this book is slam-full of it. I have rated this book as one of the highest in my life. It's great! READ THIS ONE!!!!!!"
2,This book is VERY overrated,"I picked up this book expecting an insight into the adolescent mind (actually it wasn't that long ago since I WAS an adolescent and I wanted to see if the book jibed). It was an insight, all right, insight into the head of the biggest whiner I've ever read (or met, for that matter). All the dopey protagonist did was wander around calling everyone phonies. I just wanted to smack him about the head and tell him to SHUT UP and pull himself up by his bootstraps (actually jockstrap would have been a better course of action). What would be an insightful book is one written about the weirdo/stalkers who have had copies of this overrated tome with them (John Lennon's killer had one so did the guy who killed the actress from tv's ""My Sister Sam"", etc.) I find it very hard to believe that people wanted this book banned. If anything, it should carry a warning label saying, ""WARNING: Extremely insipid book""."
2,This is a [...]!!!,"I was curious to see what all the hoopla was about, but was sadly disappointed after reading this novel. Salinger excelled in certain areas of the novel, bringing to life a post-war adolescent, catching the themes, settings, etc. of the day. Not bad writing, just not a classic, a la Hemingway, Steinbeck, etc. I will admit, I couldn't put it down: I was waiting to discover where all the ""classic"" was, but never found it, much like Holden never finds what he's looking for (at least as far as I could tell in one read)."
4,Memorable and well-written!,"J.D. Salinger revolutionized what it means to be a teenager in America, and I thank him for that. The Catcher in the Rye explored what every teenager goes through--sex, independence, and coming-of-age. Holden Caulfield is an angry young man--angry at his family, at the world, and at himself. His anger is reflective of what virtually every teenager goes through. I want everyone to rememeber that when they pick up this book. It makes the book all the more worthwhile."
2,"""Catcher"" VS. A Modern Young Adult Novel","I haven't read The Body of Christopher Creed, however I think that it should be used in conunction with The Catcher In The Rye in the education of young adults. ""Catcher"" will remain a timless classic for quite some time, but it has moments where it tends to loose a readers interests. Holden's use of langauge in the story might be slightly offensive to some while to others it may be nothing out of the ordinary. Some of the terms he uses are quite out dated and often hard for a modern young adult to comprhend in nature. ""Catcher"" poses thoughts and ideas that many young adults can often relate to and comprehend on a deeper level than some of the modern novels that deal with issues not all of us have faced. This, in turn, gives us a strong reason to continue moving forward in our reading selections while still holding on strong to the timeless classics such as The Cathcer In The Rye."
5,Great book for teenagers,"I Have read this book and I think that it is a great book for teenagers. It is well written, it describes Holden Caulfield's life in great detail, and it is extremely funny. It is written to show the slang that Holden uses in his writing, but does not make you think that the author too is using slang. Highly recommended!"
2,"Hardly ""great"", this is a boring, cynical diatribe","Judging from most of the other reviews listed here, the legions of hopelessly disaffected and jaded among us found this to be a most engrossing novel. I fear that those few who have managed to mature out of their self-righteous and idealistic teenage years will find this to be a monotonous, uneventful narrative that is wanting in meaning or purpose. While the book may serve as a reasonably good study of the cynical adolescent mind, that is its limit. With each page I expected some gleam of insight--or at least a plot twist--to emerge out of the confused, miserable rant, but instead I was dragged reluctantly through to the end of the novel without being offered even a shred of intellectual interest. If you're seeking great American literature, stick to Hemingway or Fitzgerald."
1,A complete let down!,"I had to read this book last year for my AP English class.After hearing all the hype about how it was a great American classic I was excited to read it. Ufoetunately, I was waiting for the plotline that never came. This book goes absolutely no where. It drags on and onwhile Holden complains about virtually everything and then th story just ends. Nothing extremely interesting or, as far as I'm concerned important, happened in this book at all. Just the abnoxiously cynical thoughts of a brooding teenager who's P.O.ed at the world for no good reason. Just another teenager and that's all. This book was a complete let down in my opinon and I wish I hadn't wasted my time with it. I really don't understand why people think it's amazing, it's terrible."
2,Bleh,"I find this book iritating to the core. The main character wastes away his young life complaining about how crapy society is and how phonie everything is asnd does this for ever an ever and ever. I honestly do not know why this is a ""Classic."" It has none of wonderfu; messages you find in other classic books, such as For whom the bell tolls and to kill a mocking bird. It was a torment to read, only heightened when I found out that the author is just like his character...a reclusive, winey, utterly self absorbed man who refuses to actaully try to change the world, instead just hiding away from it."
4,A transcendental glimpse into the mind of an adolescent,"Not knowing much about the storyline or theme of this ""classic"" book, I began reading it without any expectations. I was pleasantly surprised by the candid nature of the the main character's language and inner dialogue. Its rawness and bitter tone does not compromise this adolescent's view of the world.His dismissal of the ""phonies"" of an adult's social world is quite mature. This noncomformist stance in a world full of ""phonies"" makes him genuine, but refreshingly not alone. This book rings true to those who have ever felt they ""see through"" all the social nonsense necessary for those who care to fit into a mold within high society."
3,Extremely Depressing,"Okay, some day when I'm old and gray, maybe I will get why this book is an all-time master peice. (I doubt it! But I might.) I seriously disliked this book. I know what you are thinking, ""what about the symbolism?"" What about it? I did catch the under lying things in the book. Like for starters, what ""The Catcher in the Rye"" means. Holden was so feed up with people dying, that he wished that he could wait by the edge of a cliff, and when a kid comes running out of a rye feild, Hoden would ""swoop down"" out of nowhere and catch the kids. To me this book seemed entirly too whinny and used too much compulsive slang. ""Crumby"" and ""Phoney"" were seriously over used to the point that it made you sick in the stomach. I'm not denying that it was a humourous book at times it was just too ""loose"".(The topic swayed from thought to thought). But it did make me laugh sometimes, I'll give it that. But I just don't understand why people think it so great."
2,Worst book ever I geuss it would be better if you're rich,My problem with this book is that the main charecture is so unlikable. He is a spoiled rich boy who I have nothing in commen with. I geuss it would be good if you're a spoiled rich kid your self and can realate to the narorator.
5,Best book in the world. Holden is like God on Earth,"Holden is the coolest person ever. If he was alive I would like stalk him. Everybody should read this book. It's my favorite book ever, and he says so many memorable things. Every character is awesome, and its so well written. I finished it in 3 days and I'm possibly the slowest reader on earth (those were school days). There is so much metaphor, and it's not confusing at all, and its a totally new voice in books. Even though its been so long since it was written, I still love it 50 years later"
2,Why do we still read this?,"I don't understand why we still read this book. Although I understand that this book was monumental in the era in which it was first published, it doesn't really relate to the world today. For one thing the main character (Holden Caulfield) is very different from the teenagers we have today. In instances we find that he swears incessantly and has and incredibly pessimistic view of the world. This is something that most teenagers experiance but Holden carries it to another level. His consistant tounge slashings and bad talk of those around him make him a character to hate, yet strangely many identify with him and find him quite interesting. In my opinion the few days wespend with him over the 2-hundred something pages are incredibly hard to go through and I had to force myself to read this book."
3,catcher in the rye and counterfeit son review,"Since I have read Catcher in the Rye, I believe that the book should be read by all young readers. This book deals with every day problems that young men go through in their everyday lives. There is now a book with a fictional character that young men can relate to; I understood most of Holden's problems throughout the book. I haven't read Counterfeit Son, however I think all young adults should also read this book today. This book deals with kid napping. There are a lot of kid napping cases now more than ever. Kid napping has risen tremendously around the world. Many young adults do not know how serious this issue is. After reading the reviews for Counterfeit son, I finally understand that issue is more serious than I thought. Mature young adults should read both books because both of them relate to the problems we face in society today."
2,Very Disappointed,"So, this was recommended to me as I liked F. Scott Fitzgerald's work but was wanting a bit of change. It was quite a bit of change, in the wrong direction. Every other sentence is filled with curse words. Now, I won't condemn a book for the occasional curse word, but when they seem to be the only adjectives known it is very aggravating."
1,Classic my *&^,"This book was so horrible, I had to force myself to finish it. Holden was such a brat and had such a foul mouth. If I had a dollar for every GD that he uttered, I would be a millionaire. There was no rhyme or reason to this book. The author just rambles about nothing the entire book. And everything made the main character depressed. I wish I had read the reviews prior to getting this book."
1,Never received Ctcher in the Rye,We never received this item but have been charged for it. The expected delivery date has come and gone by one week now and still no book. Issue full credit for this purchase and we will get it from a more reliable source.
2,LATE DELIVERLY,"I didnt get this book untill christmas eve hours before I had to give it as a gift, defantly in used condition"
2,Tedious Adolescent angst.,"I have a Masters Degree in Literature but I find this so-called classic a great big yawn. Maybe in it's time it was revolutionary, exciting and shocking for the main character in a book to point out that most people in society are fake and to question everything but today it's been done so much it's tedious and depression. Who wants to hear an adolescent whine on and on page after page about how other people suck?He doesn't try to see the beauty or goodness in anything and in the fifties this may have been an interesting and new perspective but in today's very cynical world it's just dull. And I don't believe half the people giving this book great reviews really like it.If you want to read about adolescant angst try a book with a character who actually has some self awareness. All Caufeild does is whine.Read The Bell Jar or Prozac Nation or The Luckiest Girl in the World if you want a fascinating picture of adolesant angst instead of just a tedious whine."
2,Not Classic for Me,"I bought this book because I had heard it was a classic, and my children were required to read it in high school.This is a well-written book about a self-centered boy who considered most other people (especially adults) to be idiots. His sister was the only person he respected. He was a loser, having been ejected from several private schools. It could be assumed that he represented the disenchanted generation of the sixties and seventies, but I did not find them this negative. Perhaps authors are required to exaggerate in order to make their points."
4,Seventeen,"Although is book was written in 1951, but is still speak the hearth of typical teenager. Seventeenth or for anyone that whose feel they need to escape from their normal life and to go explore the wild side. Once this boy step into the wood; can he choices to stay or will he be able to find his way out without losing a part of him? I enjoyed he's journey very well."
5,"the ""Catcher"" in post-modern America","This book was referred to by a teacher in a school for gifted students as-""one of the filthiest books I have ever read""I guess that's one way to see it.I see it as a wonderfully funny and sad experience of our world, where education is done by people who are not educators to students who have other agendas than education and where families have no parents and no children and where the world has lost those strange creatures formerly known as human beings.Not to despair, however, because the book is wonderfully alive with humanity, and is also bizarrely edifying and real"
3,Holden really is a phoney!,"As one reviewer already noted, Holden is a phoney. I didn't read this book in high school, but many of my college friends did, and loved it. A few of them even started smoking because of this book! I wasn't so impressed. I like Salinger's voice for Holden, but the character isn't that likeable and nothing really happens. The book doesn't break any real ground other than its use of the vain saying ""god damn."" It's entertaining, but don't expect to find the meaning of life here."
4,"To accept it, first accept yourself.","This book was the turning point of my life as an English student. Holden's first-person vernacular expresses the inner, repressed voice of many, something unqiue to this book alone. Holden may depress some readers, and anger others (both, in my case), but this is the strength of this book- the reader feels a strong emotional response. Beyond the initial reactions, the teenage world of conflict between isolation and acceptance is powerfully portrayed."
2,Not a bad story line but...,"If Salinger had a broader vocabulary this book would probably be a worthwhile read. The insight into an adolescent boy's thought and emotion is interesting. Parts of it are pretty humorous. Unfortunately almost every paragraph of the first 5 chapters is rife with unnecessary cursing and swearing. (Yes, I know some kids do talk that way, but the story would have been just as potent without the bad language.) I stuck it out through the ninth chapter, and gave up. I don't want Holden's ""edgy"" language in my thoughts, or my speech."
1,Worst Book Ever?,"Possibly. The main character is a rude foul mouthed teenager. As a ""coming of age"" story it fails miserably. The lack of plot could be overlooked if like Fitzgeralds 'This Side of Paradise' the main character were simply a deeply flawed narcicist wondering about aimlessly, were it not for the lackluster writing of the author.In reading 'Catcher in the Rye' I found myself yearning for the end; waiting, hoping for a ""point"". The ending came, the point of the story never did. It read like the juvenile ramblings of a lost teenager and not an intelligent one at that.I view the time I spent reading this book as well as the money I spent on it as a complete waste. My biggest regret is that I shall never recoup the time lost which could have been better employed reading something worth while."
2,Catcher in the Wry,"Cynicism, ennui and negativity... it must be a guy thing.Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from boarding school and is rambling home. On the way he examines life from a purposeless, directionless man-child perspective that is totally lost on me.My husband, however, tells me that ""Catcher in the Rye"" is a true representation of the male internal life in late-adolescence.Too bad they make both genders read it in school. Seems like a no-brainer that the grrrls won't understand. Well, I suppose it's good training for the rest of life..."
3,From a kid that sat throught the class.,"This is what society calls good? Ive spent weeks on end by my self in situations like this and let me tell you as an adolcent teen it doenst work like that. The book over analyzes things. Like the over emphais on sex, smoking and drinking. While both are a mjor part of a teens life they do not entirely consume it. And prostition? Come on, would an 16 year old really resort to a hooker? All in all the writing was good becuase as you can probably tell i have no respect for proper english. The swearing was tried and poor, It was like a five year old trying to impress his brothers older friends. After reading the whole book im left with questions, not about what happend, but what would compell a person to write a story in this style."
4,Entertaining Book for those who Hate to Read,"I started reading this book prepaired to be bored out of my scull. To my surprise, it was very entertaining and hooking."
3,average,"the book was ok. I really don't feel anything that strong about this book. It's not that good nor is it bad. I guess it just describes some teens in their lost years. Their was no profound point or moral lesson, it's just basically rambling on about days of a teen's life"
2,SIMLY OK,"Contrary to the fact that this book is considored a classic, I disagree. This book, though it gave an interesting interpretation of the world through a ""brats"" eyes, was not beautifully written or delievered by the main character. Many my think that i was turned off by the books raw language, believe me, that was one of the ups of the book. I also thought the the story and the other characters could have been more developed and more 3 demsional, as a result of this it would help the reader feel a much more personal relationship with the main character. Also who the heck wants to read a story about a kid who complains about everything, just send me back to highschool. If you want to read a book that deals with life and human beahavior, and has and interesting, in-depth story to accompiany it, just read ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" by Ken Kensey."
3,"A Classic, But Somwhat Distracting","Somehow I escaped reading Catcher in the Rye in High School. I am not sure if it was because of the Holden Caufield in me, or if it was never part of the curriculum. Anyhow, in the interested of expanding my frame of reference and shared experiences, I ordered a copy. I found it very difficult to read, as I was put off by the language in the book. No doubt the story is a classic, but I found it somewhat distracting to read."
5,the catcher in the rye,"this book is one of if not the best book i have ever read. the book is so true to life it is almost scary. some things bother people or depress people, but you must get over them or you will end up like Holden"
3,Not what I expected,"I recently read the Catcher in the Rye, and I didn't think it was all that great. I found it a bit boring actually. I couldn't read the last 3 or 4 pages of chapter 25 because I got so tired of main characters whinning. It also seemed very likely that he had bipolar disorder.The reason why I think I was able to keep reading the book up until the end is because I can kind of identify with Holden. Aside from that, Nothing.It was basically a book where nothing happened and I was very disappointed with the way it ended."
3,low rated reviewers are whiners,"I have to say I haven't read this book since High School. But I think I would like to read it again. Because I doubt I understood it back then.All I have to say is it sounds like many people are giving it a bad review for swearing and behavior generally unbecoming of a teenage male (and then calling the good review posters 'close minded'). This is sad. Whether you like it or not, nowadays teenagers drink, swear, and, well, at least TALK about prostitutes. I know, I was a teenager once. Most teenagers aren't impressionable enough to take up drinking, swearing and the use of prostitutes after reading this book-- if they don't do it already. So you can relax, parents. This book may have been edgy for 1951; nowadays I would think it equates with a PG-13 teen drama.I'm giving the book a neutral 3 stars having not re-read it, but I wanted to get my little comment out here.PS, it's the story that counts, not the 'plot'."
2,Maybe I Just Didn't Get It??,"I read this for the first time this summer. I never had the chance in high school or college, and figured since I am in my 40s it was something I should read, if for no other reason than to find out what all the fuss was about. I found it repetative, plotless, and well, boring. I really don't consider this to be a great book, or even a particularly good book. Maybe I'm to old....."
1,Utter bilge...,"What a useless piece of trash this book is. It's repetitive, annoying, and grating. It really is. It makes me grind my teeth just to get through to the next chapter.I must say, there is ONE redeeming quality of this book - all the honest 1-Star reviews! *Do* read them, they are _infinitely_ more entertaining than the book itself!Identify with Holden Caulfield? Nope. Identify with all the other 1-Star reviewers? Hell yes!"
2,Vastly Overrated,"The character Salinger creates in ""Catcher,"" the jaded, world-weary Holden Caulfield, is simplistic and reductionist. There isn't much we can relate to from Holden, and his delineation is weak and sparse: is he the hero, or the anti-hero? I suppose the confusion is purposeful, but that's all I feel when I read this book...and this is considered one of the greatest books written by an American?!? All I can say to that is thank God there are other countries and other types of authors out there, or I would never have been able to pursue Literature in school. Try something with a little more subtlety to it, like Isherwood or Byatt; of course those are English authors, and perhaps that's why they're better writers."
2,Past its prime,"While relevant for it's time, I find it to be one of the most over-hyped books ever. To be fair, I think this about all of his writing. So it goes."
5,surprisingly funny,"I was very skeptical when I started the book, partly because I had heard so much about it. I really didn't think it could live up to the hype, but I'm happy to report I was wrong.It was easily one of the best books I've ever read, and though it was written 50 years ago, it still feels very contemporary."
1,No Offense Intended.,"I don't want to sound nasty but I'm a 15 year old girl and I read The Catcher In The Rye because I'd heard so much about how it was a timeless classic and how it perfectly portrayed teenage life etc. But I found the book incredibly boring, very unfunny and totally unrealistic so to speak. This Holden guy was behaving like a 30 year old, not a young teenager like myself and I found the book quite insulting to teenagers. I can't even describe how disapointed I was. Even Sweet Valley High is more realistic than this piece of nonsense."
1,This is a literary classic?,"Perhaps JD Salinger should have gone into hiding before he wrote this book, because I found it to be overrated and one of the worst books I have ever read. I can appreciate the coming of age novel, and even a novel where not much happens, but this book is just plain God awful.I did not care a lick for Holden and his journey. He keeps going on about how he hates phonies, but did it ever occur to him that HE IS A PHONY? His whining and rants against everyone in society got old fast.Many people I know who have also read this book say that it changed their lives, but I honestly don't see how. I recommend avoiding this book altogether, if possible. Nothing happens. It did not change my philosophy on life. I did not have a huge catharsis at the end. This book is total crap."
1,hated it.,"been reading books for around 35 years and have always heard about this book,so i finally got around to reading it.This book sucked worse than anything i can recall ever having read before.No plot ,no real story,just a bunch of rambling on about some of the most boring stuff imaginable.Dont waste your time on this crap,time would be better spent watching some grass grow.That is how boring this book is."
4,To all those people who say holden is a crybaby who hates...,everything. No really thank u for enlightining me on that subject. It was obvious that hes like that. The author wanted him to be like that. It was pretty obvious that Holden was a hypocritical person and hated everything. Overall it was a pretty good and funny book. I would have never read it if it wasnt on my summer reading list and im happpy it was. I dont even know why im writing a review scince everyone has to read it in high school anyway.
4,A milestone in American 20th century literature,"This book reads itself. It's funny, touching, realistic and well-written. Coming from France, I only read it recently but I really liked it. A American classic!"
3,"Good book, but overrated","I remember reading this book in about three days when I was in high school. I think the reason most people like this book is that they can imagine themselves writing it. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue is very straight-forward and there is lots of subtext that can be deciphered in a million ways.We can certainly all see ourselves as Holden Caufield. He does a lot of the things we wish we could do. He's like the narrator in ""Fight Club"". Sounds like a great idea until you have to live there. You can't imagine Holden as a grown-up, and you certainly can't see yourself taking this book seriously if you're over the age of 30, unless your a Lit professor.The best thing about this book is Will Smith's speech about it in ""Six Degrees of Seperation""."
5,I great CLASSIC!,"I read the reviews of this book read what it was about and I thought this looks like a good book so I decided to buy it and see for myself!Boy was that a good,but depressing book!Holdens adventures throughout the unforgiving cities were very sad and kept you reading!(I got so mad when that prostite got Maurice to beat Holden up!!)Anyway this was the classic I thought it would turn out to be!This is totally one of my favorite books!At parts I could relate to Holdens sometimes complicated feelings and other times I failed to,and yet other times I felt sorry for him.He thought mostly everything was depressing!He frequently used the phrase ""that kills me"".And he said GD at least a million times but despite that it did not ruin this great book at the look into a complicted distrubed juvenile!So if you are a teen and would like a great book to read this is it!(I'm really 14!)"
5,Moving,"This is the moving story of a boy who journeys from his school (where he didn't do so good) to NYC (New York City). All the wile, he talks about how much phonyness there is in the world. I won't give away the end, but it is awesome. VERY CLASSIC BOOK!!!"
2,Overrated,"This book is extremely overrated. While I appreciate Salinger's writing style, the story itself is pointless. Holden Caufield whines for 200-odd pages. This is somehow supposed to be relevant or edgy, but really it is just boring. The reader is given no reason to like or care about Caufield or his story. Why people gush over this book is beyond me. All Salinger has done is to paint a stereotype of a weak, callous, angry young man. I feel sorry for anyone who says they ""relate"" to this book, because it is clearly a condemnation on Salinger's part of youth in general, which I believe is unfair."
1,"Horrible Book, Annoying Character","I don't see how so many people rated this book so highly. I spent precious time reading this, that I'll never get back. If you want to waste your time reading about some stupid, snotty kid's boring experience in New York, then go ahead, read it. This book is not a classic and all copies should be burned out of existence, they really should."
4,A+++ review,"I thought that the book was absolutely fanonmenal. The main character is a great success storyThe overall language choice could have been a bit better, however it made a lot of good points that i agree withi was actually advised not to read the book, however, after i did read it, i really was glad i did. Also it makes a quick and easy read for those who need to finish up school assignments in a hurry like me!"
2,Call me lazy,"I usually force myself to get through the first 30 pages of any classic before making a negative judgement, because the awkwardness of the story's introduction usually goes away. Not in this case. I understand that the point of view is a teenager in the 20's, but reading this book is like reading child's scribble scrabble. It's extremely difficult to put up with the tedious bumbling language that Salinger uses to portray his adolescent character. I would not recommend this book to the faint of heart - you should be a literature fanatic to be able to get through this one."
2,What a complainer!,"I began this book expecting it to be supremely deep and completely understandable. What I found was that Holden was a pain in the rear teenage boy whose mission in life was to complain about everything except his stupid red hat. I was sorely disappointed.As I got deeper into the book, the more I wanted to just beat some sense into the boy for being such a complainer. He thinks that the world should bow down to him and it just doesn't work that way.I also don't understand why this book was banned. Holden has feelings that every teenager has and complains about everything. How is that different or bothering in any way? We have to go through it everyday, why not be allowed to read about it? Read it if you want, but please tell me if you find the point that makes this book so important."
5,Cynicism at its peak,"I'm not going to get into any detailed analysis of the great aspects of the book because that job has already been successfully done by the other reviewers. What I am going to say is that I highly recommend this book for teenagers, solely on the basis that I am one and I think this book has totally changed my viewpoints. Teens can really relate to Holden because of his sarcastic and cynical views on life. For me, it was amazing because I would read something from the book and then I would think, 'I can totally relate to how he's feeling or what he's thinking'. It was almost a revelation for me. No book has ever been able to capture my attention as much as this one has. So, to everyone, ESPECIALLY TEENAGERS, I highly recommend this book - Salinger's a literary genius."
5,I wish I could give it a million stars!,"This book is so wonderful. I was required to read it for English class, and I read it all within a week. I thought the writing style was superb, I really felt as if I was Holden's shadow through his ordeal, I could practically feel his physical and emotional pain. I HIGHLY reccomend this book to ANYONE who enjoys good literature. I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I did, and also I suggest reading/buying Nine Short Stories by J.D. Salinger, they are quite good also."
2,Not good for an AP English class,"I chose this book as one of my contemporary literature books for my AP English class. Of the 6 books we pick we have to write ""logs"" on them every thirty pages or so. A portion of this log requires an insight in the section and let me tell you, even though this book was awarded as Book of the Century, it is extremely hard to find anything insightful in it.The basic premise is this:""I hate everything. I'm depressed. I want to kill myself by jumping out of a window or being strapped to an atomic bomb. I'm just too much of a wuss to go through with it.""I'm sure if I had more time to read it over I could find more things in it, but if you're trying to stick to a schedule for a class, this is not the book to choose. There is very little material to work with if you have to write a good deal about the book and I honestly think Salinger was just making up this story as he went along."
2,Overrated? But of course. Classic? Not exactly,"After sifting through the mountains of good reviews this book has recieved (and the intriguing title) I decided to check it out. Bad move. (Most of) The characters, particularly Holden Caulfield, are flat, boring and Holden is not, as some reviews gush, ""identifiable with myself"" at all. Rather, he's made out to be a lost, confused (read-annoying) teenager with no direction of where he's going, leaving a large, empty hole in the plot. Phoebe, Holden's sister, is an (rather, the only) exception.Maybe I just don't get the book. Whatever. Just let me say that this was a serious letdown."
2,Good idea but would work better in a shorter form,"I loved the narrator's ""talking style"" as someone else here referred to it. I was amazed that a book written in that common language style of the 40s would fit in very well with the language many teens use today. Almost undated at all. Only in his outward respect to elders which today's cynical kids don't display.My problem with the novel is the humor and freshness wears thin after about 80-90 pages. I think this novel could have been half the length and would have been much more effective."
5,Not another boring classic,"This is the first book assigned to me for school that I actually liked. After being forced to read dreadfully boring books like Jane Eyre, The Once and Future King, the Odyessy, and then some, I went in to this book with the mind set that it was going to just be another boring classic. It wasn't though. It was great. I laughed out loud at some of the things Holden said; I'm sure if it was supposed to be funny though. He was just so random. It was great. It was so cute how he was always putting on his red hunting hat and asking everyone where the all ducks went when the lake froze. Aside from the comic aspects of the book, Holden was clearly a depressed invidual. Even though he flunked out of Pency, the school he was going to, it was obvious that he was really smart; otherwise he wouldn't have noticed all the little things that bother him so much causing him to be depressed. I recommend this book to everyone. It's easy to read and very interesting. I loved it."
2,Overrated as Hell,"I can't believe so many people like this novel. It reads like Salinger sat down and wrote it in one night, making it up as he went along. It's repetitive and pointless. The language is so trite and corny, Holden comes off as unrealistically dorky. There's really nothing approaching a plot; he just wanders around ranting about nothing. I guess maybe a lot of people like it because they relate to Holden, but I don't. It has nothing to do with cynisism; it has to do with being a whiny, obnoxious ADHD head case. I give it two stars for being fairly original and innovative (for better or worse) in its day."
5,One of my favorite books of all time,"This book has a lot of important themes that have to do with adolescence and life. Reading this book taught me a lot about life, and it definately has earned the title of a classic. It is worth it to read this book."
3,The Cather in the Rye,"This book is about a teenager who goes through depreesion and other problems most teens face while growing up. I can also relate to this book because it reminds me that sometimes i feel the same way. I recommend this book to everyone who doesn't mind faul language and the themes such as depression, lonelyness, and phonines. I really liked this book because of the things that occur. But the ending is very bad because it leaves you with unanswered questions such as what happened to Holden (the narrator) at the end."
3,Catcher in the Rye and Countrfeit Son Review,"Since I have read Catcher in the Rye, I believe that the book should be read by all young readers. This book deals with every day problems that young men go through in their everyday lives. Finally there is a book with a fictional character that young men can relate to; I understood most of Holden's problem through out the book. I haven't read Counterfeit son, however I think all young adults should also read this book today, This book deals with kid napping. There is a lot of kid napping cases now more than ever. Kid napping has risen tremendously around the world. Many young adults do not know how serious this issue is. After reading the reviews for Counterfeit son, I finally understand that issue is more serious than I thought. Mature young adults should read both books because both of them relate to the problems we face in society today."
3,Catcher in the rye,"After reading and analyzing this book i was so impressed because this book was published in the 1950's and it is still a favorite for a lot of teenagers and a classic for American Literature. The author gives us an excellent view of how was the way of living of a teenager in the 1950's and that is very similar to the way the teens live on these days. The author puts the reader in Holden shoes, and makes him feel like if he were living all what Holden lived. I recomend this book, especially to teennagers."
3,"Everyone else reviewed it, why not me....","There's enough reviews out there so you can get the details of the book, I'm just going to give my opinion of it. The books well written, well characterized and worthy of it's praise. Salinger has teenage angst and apathy nailed, though these days Holden would prob. be younger, maybe 12-14. I liked it and I didn't, the writing great, but I'm not moved by the character. He keeps bemoaning his life and saying how phony people are. Typical youth of showing how cool and knowledgable of the world they are. It gets irritating after awhile. I'm on the fence with this one, the main character is annoying, but he's annoying because he's so greatly written."
2,Not quite what I thought,"With all the good reviews, I thought this would be an excellent book to enjoy.I should have read the more mature reviews. Teens will probably enjoy thisbook as Holden, the main Character is very immature. People closer to his agewould probably be able to relate to him much more.So unfortunately I did not enjoy the book much.. I think the main problem is relating toHolden. I didn't find much within his character to relate to. Nothing he said ordid had any merit. He did not accomplish anything in the book... just wandering aroundquite aimlessly. Causing heartbreak, annoyance and stress to people who love him and/orwant to help him. Overall though I thought this book to be a disappointment"
5,A classic for the ages,"This book is a masterpiece that never grows old. J.D. Salinger brilliantly allows the reader to experience a lost weekend in New York through the eyes of a troubled, cynical teen-ager. On the surface, the book is entertaining--particularly the first-person slang in which the story is told. But beyond the surface, the story hits on numerous issues pertaining to adolescent development, and I sense that different readers will see different elements coming to the surface, depending on their own circumstances and experiences. It only takes a few hours to read, but is very rich and thought-provoking."
3,catcher in the rye,I remember this book being a 'sensation' when I was young and now I'm getting around to reading it. Haven't finished so will hold opion until then.
2,Holden Caulfield made me want to puke,"I consider myself fortunate to get through high school without reading about the cynical and misanthropic Holden. No doubt, many of today's angst filled teenagers will relate, as he reminds me of a few immature fellows that I knew. The only reason to read novel this is to obtain a perspective on teenage pessimism. Unfortunately, not much about the main character is really ever revealed, except for why he seems so detached. Salinger has timelessly captured behavior of the modern disenfranchised youth. Listen to an angry teenager for about a week, and you'll get the idea. In the end, Holden Caulfield made me want to puke."
1,Controvertial (lots of bad language),"Be warned, this slim book is controvertial because it contains foul language. I am not particularly sensitive to such language, having grown up around some wonderful, earthy characters, however even I found this excessive -- puerile even. Perhaps shocking for the sake of being shocking? I was turned off and just stopped reading it after a while (which is unusual for me). I did not see enough of the expected ""artistic merit"" to spur me on further. By all means give this book a try -- you now know what to expect, perhaps you'll have better luck. Either way, write you own review -- maybe I will be inspired to try again!"
1,I didn't like it at all !,"After I have read this book, I may say that it was a waste of time. I hate reading books and surely when it is about a young, stupid person who thinks he's THE MAN It's full of flashbacks, repeatments.The only good thing about this book is that it's realistic in a way.When I read a book like this I'm not focused at all. I understand it when people like this book, but I don't, because I dislike Holden that much that when he would be in our class we have disputes all the time.He's depressed all the time.I hate such people as much as this book. If you don't have to read it, don't. If you have to, good luck!"
1,Why the Hoopla?,"I managed to reach well into middle age before I finally picked up this book that I've heard so much about since my teen years. I disliked reading books back then. In my 30's, when my passion for reading ignited, ""Catcher"" just was not on my personal list. I finally picked up a copy and plowed through it. What's the point? It was a nice coming of age story, but nothing special. The main character was someone whom I would like to avoid had he been a real, live presence in the world. In short, ""Catcher"" wasn't worth my time. I can see why J.D. Salinger is one of the most noted recluses. I'd be embarrassed, too."
1,Very Overrated,"I read this book in order to help my son write a book report. Maybe my review is so awful because I am 36 and can no longer relate, but being an avid reader, I found this to be the worst book I've ever read. Until I read other reviews, I got nothing out of it except for some young punk literally ""rambling"" on and on about his miserable life."
2,Overrated: Not a classic at all,"I read it out of pure curiosity. I`ve heard that it was a classic and I wanted to see for myself. This book can only be considered ""classic"" in that it was one of the earliest of its kind adressing teenage anxieties. So I give Salinger credit for being a pioneer; but the book was not written that great and is quite boring at times. A quarter through the book; I felt my self saying ""I get the point already!""The next step for me was to try to compare it to other ""classics."" Of course this is subjective but I read the Illiad last summer, and felt it was one of the best pieces ever written. I felt the same way about Tolstoy`s ""War and Peace."" Lord of the flies, of Mice and Men are much better works. I am left wondering what is the big deal about this work. I`ll gladly take Anne Rice any day."
5,my favourite book of all time,"I recieved it when I was thirteen as a birthday present and ahve been reading it every year, eversince. I plan on continuing to do so. Its different everytime.If you like this you should definitely try J.D Salingers other books, they're even better!"
5,catcher in the rye,possibly the best book ever written. incredible symbolism and use of images. Recommended for preteens to adults.
4,GRAND,"At first, the novel was really enjoyable to read, but as I got toward the end, it slowed down a bit. This is somthing I didn't enjoy and its why I didn't give it 5 stars. The most enjoyable part about the novel, was the way it was written. When you read, it like your talking to someone, which makes it really easy. Everything was very clear and easy to understand. Good writin' J.D.!"
1,I laughed when I saw the SOuth Park episode on this because I feel the same way,"So the cather in the rye is about a teenage boy that feels lost and isolated after failing out of his school and he goes on a whirlwind of an emotional roller coaster trying to fill the void in him caused by depression and anxiety. After reading this, I was ready to shoot a president myself, too bad George W is not still in office. I think this book is overrated and would not recommend it to anyone."
3,What was all the hype about?,"I've just finished reading this book out of curiosity and I expected much more.I'd heard about it being banned and naturally wanted to know what it was all about.No big deal.Just an ordinary book.I'll admit that it was good and I laughed out loud a few times but he droned on alot,and come on now, how many times DOES this boy say 'it killed me' or 'goddam'? It also got on my nerves the way everything depressed him.But I think it was nice that he was so caring about his sister. I certainly don't think this book should have been banned,but read itjust for the sake of it. ""Catcher in the rye?Yeah,I've read it."""
5,DIGGIN IT THE MOST BABY,"So here we are in the wasted society of 1999 and this book will rock your world. Holden always knew what the world had in store for him, and he tried to keep up.He took a pin on a quater and relized he was just a pup. I thought it was awesome. I think every one can relate to that little time when we almost lost it and relized we didn't need it."
4,AAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life!It may take a little time but at the end, we get very attached to the main character, Holden, and we just want to read it once over again!"
3,Somewhat Out of Date... But a CLASSIC Nonetheless!,"Many should read this story to better understand the importance of examining ones place in the world. Also, as with the protagonist in this story, the significance of perhaps never understanding ones place in the world. For a more contemporary take on the feeling of alienation, also check out Joseph Green's ""Pseudo Cool."" This novel is also a powerful examination of ones so-called place in this world."
3,"Great book, a little dissapointing","On one hand, this book was written fantastically, and really showed a lot about a teenage boy's life in a duration of just a few days. On the other hand, I was a bit dissapointed with the book. I hear everyone rave on and on about the book, like teachers, librarians, even my parents. The Catcher in the Rye just wasn't holding me down to my seat, or glueing my eyes to the book like other novels due. All in all, good book, overrated."
2,What's the point?,Overrated. Should not enjoy the status it has. Sends the wrong message to young people. Lacks depth. How it has earned a devoted following is beyond me. I had the dubious honor of writing a book report on this when I was 14. It is ultimately forgettable.
5,An All Time Classic!,""" The Catcher in the Rye' wasn't a book that I had the chance to read in high school. Recently, my wife recommened the book to me. She said it would be something I would really enjoy. She was right. I couldn't put the book down. It is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. Salinger's masterpiece follows the misadventures of 16 year old Holden Caulfield. The book follows Holden on a three day journey through New York. He shares his cynical and often negitive views on life,family and ""so-called"" friends. He finds faults in almost everyone he talks about.If they aren't Phony they are boring. At one point, you realize that he's just as phony as everyone else.There are points where you feel for Holden and other times you hate him. The brilliance of the book is not the plot. obviously there hardly is one. But it doesn't matter. What makes this book work is it's study of the human condition. Salinger has really hit the nail on the head with this timeless classic."
2,Boring but Meaning Ful,"This book could not have had a more boring plot. What is so important about everyday life, hey it happens to every one. So why fill 200 pages on it. It is though okayly written and has some meaning . But it is going to happen to everyone. -Coleman Potter-"
4,How could you not like this book?,"I was advised to read Catcher in the Rye after I got hooked on the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. Its a brilliant book, and it gets better each time you read it. Ok, so it babbles sometimes, but that just lets you into Holdens character even better. I think its a fantasic book. Pros' its a great book and theres maybe some Holden in all of us. Cons' Where do the ducks go in the winter? Hmmmmmm?Anyone who could only give this book 2 stars is obviously not mature enough to appreicate such classic writing... go on, read it!"
3,Catcher tiring,"I remembered how much I enjoyed this book when I read it 60 years ago. At this reading, though, I found that I grew tired of Caulfield's spoiled immaturity. I am less able to put up with his antics. Salinger's writing is still terrific, however."
3,The Catcher in the Rye,Book reads as a teenager talks. I think I would have loved it when I was in high school but find it rather tedious at age 64.
4,Disgusted With Human Behavior?,"If you are disgusted with human behavior, well then so is Holden Caulfield. I read this book after it was recommended to me by a friend in college. I had just finished telling him that THE BELL JAR is my favorite book of all time, and he instantly replied by telling me that if I had enjoyed THE BELL JAR then I would definitley love THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, and love it I did! Although Holden is extremely biased when it comes to judging his environment yet not applying the same standards to himself, his ability to judge people is piercingly insightful and intriguingly accurate. I fell in love with this book and read it in a lil' over 3 hours. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are the type that thinks that this world is a little bit too superficial and ""phony!!!"""
3,I don't get it.....,"I read this book because it is considered a ""classic"", but I seriously do not get it. I am giving it 3 stars because it was a quick read, but I do not understand the point. I agree with the other reviewers who stated that it went no where, no real theme. I did not like Holden because of his bad attitude and pessimistic outlook, guess that's why he ends up in a psychiatric institution. Only when I read some online reviews and explanations of the book could I see where there was some symbolism Salinger was possibly using."
3,Review,"In the catcher in the rye, Holden Caulifield is the main character. It starts out with Holden in his school in which he is about to get kicked out because of poor academic grades. Being annoyed everyone in his school he decides to leave a few days before the end of the term and go to New York to where his family lives. As he gets to NY, he gets a hotel and goes through a adventure. Then, decides to go see his sister Phoebe and decides to spent some time with her. At the end of this book Holden says he is going to go back to school and apply himself."
1,Catcher & the Rye,Terrible book. The guy in the story is a loser and not a good influence for anyone reading it. Very little meaning behind it at all. I do not recommend this book to anyone. It is a little interesting to read though.
1,Not worth the money,This was the most terrible book I have ever read. I wan a refund for all of my money and time put into this. Oh if this sells the world is ending.
1,Incessant Whining and Complaining...,"Incessant whining and complaining are all that comprise this book. I cannot for the life of me understand why it is such a well-loved novel, or how it even came close to being considered a classic! I had to read this in high school and I HATED every moment of it. To this day, every time I hear the title I cringe. I think this book should be forever banned from the list of ""Classic, Must-Read Literature""."
1,Horribal Book,"Ahhh! I /hated/ this book! I had to read it for school and I didn't even finish it. Please, /never/ buy this book. It is like the plague, and should be avoided as such! *Shivers* It gives me the shivers to even think about it."
4,Finished poorly,"The book started well and held the attention of the reader to the very end. However, the end left many questions. Those questions made me give the novel only a four star rating."
3,The book was extremely interesting and realistic.,"The book hit many good subjects. Holden was a great character, his life story was kind of funny yet I could relate to it. He seemed mature through most of the novel. Many people may misunderstand his character. The ending was kind of dissappointing because Holden gave up."
3,catcher boy,this book is extremely good.....duh... people around 15 should read it....but u gotta have a mood to read coz it's kinda stupid.... well....it's ur choice.....read it or not...Holden's a great guy...he loves to lie.....loves playing checkers w/ Jeanne.....
1,"Alas, this is actually known as a ""pop icon."" Poor America.","FIRST OF ALL, IGNORE THE ONE STAR, AMAZON DIDN'T HAVE A SETTING FOR NO STARS. I had to read this trash for school in my ninth grade year. I took a neutral approach, if not a little bit positive, for the book before I read it. I had one of those beatnik teachers who wanted to find the hidden meanings in this worthless waste of time. We were searching in a dark room for a black cat that wasn't there. There are no hidden meanings in this book, nor are there any sort of points or end destination. Nor will you find anything worthwhile except for the brief moments of shock value when the author uses curses or talks about sex. I have read many books and frankly, this is the worst trash I have set my eyes on. SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS TRASH, READ CLASSIC LITERATURE!"
1,Junk,so many other good books...don't waste your time on this one. J.D. Salinger went into hiding because he was embarassed. Everything else by Salinger is just as bad.
2,I don't get it....,"Okay, ""Catcher in the Rye"" is supposed to be the classic book and everyone supposedly loves it but come on! I almost fell asleep. I kept waiting for something to happen and yet nothing really did. I tried to finish this book but didn't because every time I picked it up I knew that it was going to be a total waste of my time and brain capacity.The author had no word choice and the sentences were flat and dull.I may be missing something but I didn't get the point."
2,I did not much enjoy the rough edges of this book.,I read this book as chosen summer reading for my freshman year. I was quite offended by the extreme use of vulgarity and the numerous references to sexual situations. I found this book morally disturbing that this 16 year old is on the verge of a mental breakdown and nobody seems to notice or care.
4,"""It killed me...""","Even though this book isn't exactly recent, it still is a valid written expression of many teenagers' mood. I read the book last winter and, when I read it, I could feel like Holden. I realised that my thoughts and my way of thinking was pretty similar to Holden's. I could understand his rebellion and almost agree with it. I felt like him very much.I think ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is an aethernal book. Every teenager, no matter if it'll be in 200 years time, will identify himself with Holden Caulfield. If you're an adolescent and you read that book, as I did, it's like you are reading your diary.That's the way it is. Every one of us, at some point in life, will find himself thinking like Holden. Holden will always be alive in our minds."
5,Do YOU really understand this book?,"Having just read this book within the last month or so, I am still asking myself if I really understand the content of it. I do realize, however, that I can relate to the 16-year-old Holden Caulfield. Being only a year younger than H.C. we have many similarities. The most imortant one that continues to remind myself of Holden's emotional problems, is that I also lost a sister to cancer. Although, the one major difference between us, is that I was treated for my depression soon before Holden's was. Of course technology of such situations have improved, therefore, allowing myself to not make many of the mistakes H.C. made. Including those relating to school, friendships, family,etc. Many do not understand the emotional effect a death can have on a person, which can very often turn to depression and nervous collapses. Until one can, shall I ask, WILL you really understand The Catcher in the Rye?"
5,Alone in sharing book's merits,"I first read ""Catcher"" in 1984 since it was required reading for my high school English Comp class. The day we submitted our essays on this book, our teacher asked if we enjoyed the book. Oddly enough, I was the only one to raise my hand. Out of a class of 35 students, I was alone in my appreciation of this book! How could this be? I was still in shock when my teacher, Mr. Ellis, asked why I liked the book. I shyly responded, ""I don't know, just did."" One thing I would change, if given the opportunity to go back in time, would be to properly respond to his inquiry. I regret not having the nerve to share my appreciation and rail against them for missing the point of the story: a teenager's menatal emotional collapse as he trys to come to grips with his purpose in life. Unfortunately, I come from a generation that grew up with John Hughes movies...Over the years I have read ""Catcher"" many more times and still enjoy it as much as I did back then. Thank you Mr. Ellis."
4,A very good book,"In Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield, a seventeen-year-old teenager in New York City, talks about his 1-day stay in the Big Apple. Being as young as he was, most of us that read the book in our high school would relate it to ourselves. Out of all the shenanigans he gets into, he decides to question his life goals, and is very nervous, upset, and disappointed that he does not enjoy having a free life, mostly because he isn't preparing for it. The author uses text-life connections in this novel, hoping that the actions, decisions, and how things lay out will relate to a younger audience. It did too. Most of the teens here, including me, were interested in reading this because it was a mirror of our lives, through a book, and through someone else's tale."
3,muy interesante,"This book was very difficult to comprehend at first. I had to read it for an English class, over the summer. I didn't understand it, and thought that Holden was just a very immature and coloqial kind of person. But when I read it again, I got most of the humor, and understood everything a lot better. Everyone has to read it in school, so if you haven't read it yet, READ IT!"
2,A whine-fest of self-destruction,"Salinger does an excellent job of capturing the thoughts of an angsty, foul-mouthed, rebellious teenager who lets his wildly shifting, hormone-driven emotions control his life. However realistic Holden Caulfield might be, he is a thoroughly unpleasant spoiled brat who I was very tired of by the time the book petered out.Sure, some people (especially teens) might be able to identify with some of the confusion, awkwardness, fear of the future, longing for the past, and hatred of ""phonies"" expressed by Holden, but he is so lacking in any positive traits (other than a fondness for his siblings) that I had absolutely no sympathy for him. His way of speaking reminds me of Alex from ""A Clockwork Orange,"" but unlike ""Catcher"" that book has some interesting moral/ethical dilemmas. I think this book is just a pointless whine-fest of self-destruction no matter how well-written it is."
1,Crumby Book,"This lousy book written by some hot shot J.D. Salinger is possibly the worst book ever written. It's one of those books people write to make them selves feel smart and whatever. You know they guy wrote it just so he could say ""oh it's a deep reflection on the teenage alienation"" what a joke. My school made me read this lousy book, man are they a pain in the ass. I didn't even read the entire goddamned 26 chapters. People who think this book is a classic and profound or whatever are just a bunch of phonies. It kills me to think that someone actually thinks this book means anything, it doesn't."
5,'Catcher' review,"I find ""Catcher in the Rye"" accurate in describing the way that troubled teens feel. I really enjoy Holdens' negative views toward the world, it made me feel that I was not the only person unhappy with certain aspects of the world around us. Also, I think that I learned a lot about others views of the negative people, often feeling sorry for Holden and the situation that he got himself into in the story."
5,The Best Book,"After reading ""The Catcher in the Rye"", I was amazed. I had to read it again. When I had finished it the second time, I was even more awestruck by the book than I was after the first reading. It is a book not just about teen angst, but about life. It is one of the greatest books I have ever read, if not the greatest. Anyone who enjoys reading, should read this book. Anyone who has ever argued with their parents, should read this book. Anyone who can read, should read this book."
5,Simply Put,"We all hate having teachers force us to read books in school. This time I am glad they did. Cather In The Rye has to be the single most expressive book I have ever read. The book is put into words that a teen can understand perfectly. Although there are some underlying webs of connections in the book, most everything is simply put into teenage thoughts and language. It deals with every problem and every situation. The book is simply a marvel to be read and enjoyed. You'll either hate it, or love it. As for it trying to be banned, like you don't hear that language anyway. It is a way of expression and without it, the teenage angst character would not have been expressed properly. Read it, you may love it or dispise it, but read it."
1,What the...?,"What's the big fuss over this book? I was looking for ""classics"" and I kept hearing people rant and rave over this book, so I figured I should read it and maybe be enlightened or something. No such luck. As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait to get to the point of the book, which never seemed to come. It was so incredibly boring that I didn't even finish the book. I was bound and determined to do so, but I was losing my mind, reading this book. I had about enough of hearing Holden repeat himself on each and every topic, and hearing about ""phonies"". I could definitely have been better off reading something else. So, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,A Classic What?,"I'm not sure what I expected with The Catcher in the Rye, but it was a lot more than what I received.Going into the book, I knew little to nothing about the book except that it was a classic and Holden was supposed to be an icon. Maybe it is the fact that I'm 20 years past being a teenager, maybe it is that I got lost in the lingo of the 50s and maybe I just believed the hype too much, but I was severely disappointed. I did not like Holden in any way shape or form. I thought he was a whiner and the biggest phony of the bunch. I had no trouble with the drinking, or smoking or cussing, I just did not like him and can not recommend this book."
2,An American classic?,I suspect that I am going to be real unpopular with my review but here goes. I ordered this book just because it is on the list of American Classic Literature. I am 55 and had never read it. The book I received was copywrite 1951 and in great condition. I was anxious to read it and started immediately. I got through about a third of it and then put it down. I had a hard time picking it up again and acutually skipped a few pages toward the end just to get through it. I thought it was extremely boring. I suppose that at the time that it was written perhaps it was a very revealing book aout the life of a young man but I just couldn't get excited about it at all.Sorry to all of you that I have insulted.
2,"Dull, slow and whiny","I tried to trudge through this novel in the 1980s when I was twenty. People had told me it was a book any young person could relate to, so I gave it a shot. At the time, I found nothing remotely relatable or interesting about it.I picked it up again in my 40s and again found nothing engaging or redeeming in the plot, characters or writing. It's like slow torture, watching this self-pitying, self-destructive, self-involved jerk spiral out of control. Are we supposed to pity him? Are we supposed to see ourselves in him? It's hard to care what happens to Holden, other than maybe feeling a deep-seated hope that he'll shut up already.It's clear what the appeal must have been 60 years ago: The narrator's then-naturalistic language broke taboos and the book spoke frankly about things traditionally unmentionable in fiction about teenagers. A sullen teen antihero was a radical change. But on its merits as literature away from that context, it's pretty awful."
3,an ordinary life story,"I am an english learner and my teacher told me to read this book for summer.many of you would think that this is a very good book but i don't think so. the book is about a boring story, the only thing that makes it good is the writing. the author has used a very informal language which makes the book natural and more real.if the plot would be more exciting this writer would rule!"
4,A great read,"The Catcher in the Rye was a hard to put down book. I loved the conversational style of writing, ""and all"" (a phrase often used by Salinger). I had to close my mind to some of the language. Although the choice of words may have been fitting to capture the essence of the main unstable character represented in the book, ""and all"".Glad I read the book and would recommend it to others.I was delighted with the speed in which I received the book, as well as the condition of the book."
1,Catcher in the Rye,"I read this book because I heard that it was a classic. After reading it I can tell you that I thought it was a complete waste of time. I feel sorry for anyone who can ""relate"" to Holden Caulfield. I found him to be a pathetic, imature malcontent who has squandered his opportunities and advantages. I kept reading and hoping that he was going to change his attitude but it never really happened.I consider this ""classic"" to be highly over-rated."
2,Depressing maybe?,"Perhaps I'm missing the point of this book. I picked it up a few years ago and tried to read it and couldn't get into it. So, this year, I decided to try again in an attempt to plow through some of the ""classics"" of literature.I do like how Salinger really gets into the mind of a troubled teenager who is searching for meaning out of life and never really finds it. I like the personal writing style...informal and not stuffy and distant.However, I was disturbed by the book. In delving further into Holden's mind shows a person who isn't satisfied with anything, is deceptive, sneaky, phony himself, and depressed. I seriously kept waiting for a suicide attempt to happen in the book, or something equally horrid.This book is worth the read if you really want to ponder the human mind for a while. I can only give it 2 stars because I was left bereft from it."
2,Rare Dissapointment,"I read this book because I had heard good things about it.However, it turned out to be one of the rare books that I just can't find anything good to say about it. In most books there is always something I take away from it, a characte, the plot, the style, something. In this book I hated the main character and his constant statements of: ""really I'm not kidding"" or something to that effect. There was seemingly no plot and i wasn't impressed with salinger's style. It is honestly the only book i have ever hated and would never want to read again and ive read a lot of books, i'm not easy to dissapoint. However, i believe this is one of the most highly overrated works in American literature, especially if you find the characters as obnoxious as I did."
3,catcher in the rye,"descriptive, thought provocing writing. J.D. Salinger has a way with words that causes the imagination to relive or relate to almost all of his writing. Great story...."
4,The Catcher In The Rye,"I read this book in one day, just couldn't leave it. I don't know why this book is so good, but it just is. Got me hooked from the start. It may have been written way back when, but its also very now. Everyone should read it. The Catcher in the Rye, fantastic title for a fantastic story."
2,Classic? No. Good? Not really.,"I may have missed the point. I am sure that many previous reviewers would find it convenient to attribute this to my age (17) and the fact that this book was required reading. However, I have to wonder something. Is it possible that people are reading WAY too much into this story? I find it more than likely. It's been my experience that if you put something in front of someone and say that it's a classic and has a very deep, significant meaning, they will find one no matter what. In short, I think the novel is dull and poorly written. Those of you who found some grand significance, I applaud you but feel perhaps rather than of finding a revelation in the book, you've found one in yourself."
5,Holden Caulfield is the best character of all time...,"I can't believe how much this book makes you think. My teacher made ME-and only ME-read this book for my English class. Being 16 years old and so familiar with the title but never have read it, I was apprehensive. After the first 20 pages of this book, I was absolutely blown away by the simpleness, yet mental complexity of this novel. I went back to school the very next day and thanked my English teacher over and over again for making me read this. He told me he knew I would like it and that I would find many similarities between Holden and myself, as every teenager will. I am no longer afraid to read some of the contemporary authors and I now indulge myself in good literature. Thanks to this book I have found a new part of me. I found the part who loves to read."
4,The Search For One's Self,"The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most moving books I have ever read. With that said, I have not given the novel 5 stars, because it does have some flaws, and with that, comes some disappointment. None of that comes from the novel's main character though. Holden Caulfield is one of the most intruging and lost souls ever created. The way he searches for himself in this novel is unbelievable. We feel sorry for him, and sympathise with him, and the weird thing is, we don't even realize that we're doing it. He is so hypnotic that by the end of the novel, we are just like him, and actually want to be like him. We wish we could be as courageous as he was. It's amazing that a novel could have that much power on you, but The Catcher in the Rye actually does."
3,"Jonas' opinion of ""Catcher in the Rye""","Jonas' opinion of ""The Catcher in the Rye"", by Jerome David Salinger.I find it a very good novel because it learns the reader about American schools and the reader is exposed to the American tradition. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a very good frog because he can mislead everybody he wants to (the three women around thirty in the hotel at New York, for instance). Holden is very independent of people and he can take care of himself very well. I admire him because he has the guts to kid with Stradlater (I would never have challenged that tough guy). This book has a few tiny little bad points: it has to many chapters, to many characters and it's typed so small that's even difficult to read if your eyes are all right. There's more but that's not so interesting for me.My greetings to you, Mr. Geerinckx,Your pupil of 6MWb,J.Duyck"
4,so easy to read,"This book had me from the first page. It was a pleasure to read. I found it funny, sad and interesting. What most intrigues me about this book is its lack of traditional model. there is no build-up, climax, and conclusion. It just is. Except for some strange terms used by the speaker, it is difficult to imagine that it was written so long ago. There are some memorable scenes from this book that will no doubt stay with me. I was very taken with the main character's sarcasm, wit and innocence."
5,Oh Boy,I am gonna make this short and sweet. This book is a must for anyone. If you haven't read it... do so now! The fact that it was banned in many countries frightens me.
1,Catcher in the rye SUCKS,"Reading this book was a dull thing to do. I didn't like it because the style Salinger used began to work on my nerves after a while. The language Holden uses is recognizabel from TV and rap music because he swears a lot. In the beginning this was quite amuzing but it irritated me in the end.Holden never knows what he has to do, he constantly hesitates when he has to make a decision.The only thing what matters for him is what other people think about him. The things Holden does aren't very realistic, which 16-year-old boy would hire a prostitute in stead of visiting his mum who lives a few blocks further? I think Holden is a sick person whose personality is only interesting for psychiatrists. The only good thing about him is the fact that he always wants to protect others. But if he is really so loving and caring, why does he lie so much? The intire book is one big lie, none of it is thrue and therefor reading this book is a useless thing to do."
1,AWFUL!,"I am very open minded when it comes to literature (I even read through Mein Kampf without any objection) but I just hated this book! If it wasn't required reading, I would have stopped on the fourth page! I think Salinger could have done much better!"
1,Not all classics are worth reading...,"I have made a goal to read as many of the classic books of the Western World as I can. Who voted this book into the this prestigious group anyway? The book consists of 277 pages of a young man whining about the world not being fair. Through the book he continually makes choices that bring to pass the very reality he is trying to avoid. If the goal of the book is to teach us that we create our own problems in life, it is successful. It approaches this topic in a very vulgar, drawn out way. You have learned that lesson in the first 20 pages. There are too many wonderful books out there to waste your time with this one..."
4,The Catcher in the Rye,i enjoyed reading the book. it was the best one that my class read the entire year. the only reason that it got a 4 instead of a 5 was because i really didn't like the ending to it. i thought that it would end differently than it did. other than that it was one of the best books that i have ever read.
3,Not So bad not so good,This book was actually pretty good. It was full of humor and adult themes that keep you turning pages as long as you can. The book is well written but is sometimes hard to follow due to its stream of consciousness style it is written in. The one thing i can say is i do not recommend this novel for younger readers as it has many foul words and adult concepts such as underage drinking drugs and sex. Overall if you enjoy a good book with great humor whit and excitment this book written over half a century ago is for you. Just don't expect to get a moral or theme out of it.
1,I was not impressed.,"After reading reviews for this book, I dug it up in my dad's old books and read it. It stunk. It seemed to me that Holden spent too much time whining. It was fluff. If you have the desire to read a book that goes nowhere in 200 pages, read this book!"
1,I'm ruining the average,"By giving 'Catcher"" one star I realize that I am ruining its high average, but I also figure that if you're really interested in buying it, you'll read the bad stuff before ALL the reams of good stuff otherwise availiable. So I tricked you. One star for one terrific book. I assure you, Holden offers more insight to the average teenage lost soul than most anything out there. Granted it doesn't speak to everyone in the same way, but I assure you if you found 1 minute of your teenage years awkward, Catcher will strike a chord with you. So read it, it won't take long, as it is hard to put down. Ciao."
1,"Okay, when does the 'Classic Literature' start?","A very good friend told me that I MUST read this book. That it was a 'literary classic' and was her favorite book of all time. So I buy the book and start reading, waiting for the new insights to start rolling in. And waiting, and waiting......AND WAITING. I guess this pointless dirvel may appeal to the ""awwww, nobody understands me"" baby boomer generation but to me it was a complete waste of time. By the end of the book, you can't decide if you are more irritated with the character (Holden Caulfield) or yourself for wasting your time on this twaddle. Don't become another victim of hype, skip this book and read something 10 times more insightful, like ""The Cat in the Hat""."
1,Peter's review for the Catcher in the Rye,"I would not recomend this book because the whole book is about the main character, Holden Caulfield, and how he spends the first couple days of hiding in New York from his parents. he was hiding because he found out that he had gotten kicked out of his prep school. THe whole book is about how he meets some of his old friends and always says how phony they are, or how much he thinks they are anoying. yes...i don't like this book!"
2,I could not stand this novel,JD Salinger is an idiot. The Catcher in the Rye has no artistic merit. I wrote similar pieces as a 2nd grader.
2,Pointless,"This novel is pointless. The character is whiny and immature (yes, he's in high school), and nothing happens. I have no idea why this book developed such a cult following."
1,Boring and annoying,"I usually finish all the books I start, no matter how bad. The Catcher in the Rye has the questionable honor of being the only book I couldn't finish. It was boring and I found the characters annoying to the point they made me furious."
3,Eh,"I had to buy this so I could read it over the summer for an assignment (English Honors).The story line is really boring, but apparently there's some sort of symbolic message in the story that I didn't catch... Maybe it was because I was sleeping. :)Pretty boring but you might like it...Eh"
2,The catcher in the rye,"The challenges and fortunes that adolescents must confront along with immaturity and inexperience make growing up an uphill battle. However, many of us go through similar events that mold our ego with which we either learn and apply or just lower our guard and call it quits."
2,The Catcher in the Rye,The subject matter of the book was disappointing. The writing was excellent but I did not enjoy it because of the subject matter. I should have read it in high school but waited too long and I seriously wanted to give that kid in the book a kick in the butt!
3,It's Ok.,"I think that the book ""catcher in the rye"" was a good book but not a great one. It's basicly about a boy, Holden Caulfeild, that gets kicked out of a prep school because he is failing every class. His parents don't expect him home for a few weeks, so he wanders around New York city. Throughout the book he calls up people he knows from the past just to talk. I also wasn't to fond of the author's writing style. He always goes into so much detail about stuff that isn't relevent to the story.Besides that, I thought the story was funny, although they probobly weren't supposed to be. I also thought the story itself was pretty good, as I'm sure anybody can relate to Holden in someway or another."
4,Delightful,"The Catcher in the Rye is a very entertaining book. It was an easy read and very realistic. It tells of Holden Caulfield, a teenager who has just been kicked out of a boarding school and tells of those he comes in contact with. He humors the reader throughout the book and I recommend this book for anyone who needs a good read!"
3,"Very good, but not as memorable as Angela's Ashes or I Knew I Was Naked","This is the first of three modern boyhood novels, and it became an icon. Catcher introduces Holden Caulfield, and earthiness-sex is present. Angela's Ashes introduces Frank Mc Court, and earthiness-sex is prominent. I Knew I Was Naked introduces Sean Lacey and Bryan O'Neill, and earthiness-sex takes center stage from start to finish. The three books were written in the named order, each giving a different perspective on young males from the psychosexual standpoint. Warning: The last-named will test your shock resistance."
4,"Amazing book, but BAD quality","As many people previously said, this book is a book that every living person should read it. I've have read already like 3-4 times on my mother language (Macedonian), but I always wanted to read it on its original language so I order it from here.What blocked my impressions was that the print is really bad, the font is bold and not sharp, some parts are ligher some havier, the paper is yellow (for christ sake - what Holden would said), it is very bad paper. the Cover is very thin and light, I espected some better quality and design here.There isn't any Author's Biography or something, some info etc, that's strange.I had bigger expectations, I am dissapointed by the quality of this edition."
1,Please...a high school reader???,"I thought I was purchasing a regular hardback copy of the ""Cather in the Rye"" and the product received was less than anticipated.I received a book 7"" X 4"" that was a high school copy for a literature class at F.D. Roosevelt H.S. It really is a paperback with a new binding. Does that make it a hardback??? Technically one might say so but not in the spirit of what anyone who purchases books would call a hardback and it certainly was not worth the $15 I paid for it.I am disappointed"
1,Banned for boredom,"I read this during banned book week. I had not read it before, but it's a classic. And hey, I wanted to see what could be so bad in it to ban it.Hoo boy! Did I ever figure out. This book was obviously banned for being the single most boring book ever written. Or perhaps the incidence of boredom induced coma was so high, they felt the need to ban it. I don't know. But I never did see anything horrible or even questionable in this book - nevermind interesting.I'm sure people will comment about what a great piece of work this is. To them, I say ""meh"""
2,Insanely dull,"Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I was that teenager, too. Yeah, Salinger writes like he talks (so what?). Yeah, it made an impact on a certain era of teenagers. But does it deserve to be called a classic now? Absolutely not."
1,"How this became a ""classic"" is puzzling to me","I had not read this book since I was a teen and my Son mentioned he recently read it & loved the book. I picked up a copy and figured since he generally makes good recommendations to me, it would be worth reading again. WRONG!I suppose if you like reading about someone who has some ""issues"" or difficulty fitting in with peers, this book could appeal to you. That being said, the story just rambles, doesn't seem to have an actual story line, just randomness. I was neither inspired nor entertained by it. The story left me wondering who determines what is an ""American Classic"". Half way through the book, I was hoping the story would suddenly grab me. Regretfully, that never happened. I would recommend not wasting your time (or money) on this book. When I finished the book, the only positive feeling I had was now I could begin reading another book. I truly wondered why a publisher would have agreed to publish this book."
2,wow teen angst,"I hated Catcher in the Rye, maybe it's because I'm a teenager, and undestand what Holden is going through, but it was just whiny. It's like an eloquent teenager started a livejournal and they turned into a book. I give it two stars out of kindness, but if I wasn't feeling so generous I would give it one star."
4,The Catcher in the Rye,"The Catcher in the Rye is a book that I am still pondering after reading it. The main character is the narrator and his name is Holden Caulfield. I would say that this story is very much a character study in that the whole book we're figuring out what Holden wants, what's going through his mind, and the reasons for the stories of all the people he encounters. He has very much growing up to do and I'm coming to the conclusion that he doesn't want to think that there is bad in anyone. That there is this continued innocence that he doesn't want to let go of. I enjoyed the style that the book was written in. It gave a sort of originality, being that it was Holdens exact thoughts and written in such an informal way that you felt he was just speaking to you. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I think that teenagers would enjoy it most though."
2,Depressing,"Holden Caufield has problems. He is feeling sorry for every one else, and can't see that he can't help the whole world."
5,"a great classic, banned or not",this has to be my favorite book of all time!!! the way Salinger describes Holden Caulfield's journey through adolescent life is extrordinary. Salinger makes you feel like you are right in the action!!! this is a definite MUST READ.
1,Could you whine just a little more?,"Let me set it straight, if anyone comes to a problem in life, SOLVE IT, DONT B*TCH ABOUT IT. If you can understand that much, and can agree, this book is NOT for you."
3,Was not enjoyable,I liked how the author writes but over all I thought that the book was boring and had no point.
1,Classic Literature?,"I'm sorry, the only persons I can see enjoying this completely obscure and opaque story are little pissants too self important to understand that no one else has the slightest interest in them."
1,A disgusting look at self hatred,"I dispise this book. It simply portrays a boy, not quite a man, who because he hates himself and has no redeeming qualities gets himself kicked out of various schools and then ends up in an insane assylum. he is pathetic. He has no drive or redeeming actions. He is an all talk yellow person. To use his own terms. Holden Caufeild nauseates me. I forced myself to finish this book simply because it was on one of my self prescirbed summer reading lists. Despite this books other properties it is well writen and does protray a certain time in America. But I will never sympathise with the protagonist."
5,How many do you own?,"Do you want a conversation starter? Carry this book around campus for a week and see how many people come up to you and tell you how much they loved reading it! I think it was excellent, and I own fie copies... it freaks out the roommates. *evil grin*"
4,A timeless classic,"Catcher in the Rye was an excellant book. Most high schoolers find it much easier to read than Hawthorne or Shakespere. The main character, Holden is very interesting. His strange ways and beliefs is what makes the book. Unfortunetly his attitude gets a little boring, and his strange ways tiresome. But Holden experiences keeps you anticipating from chapter to chapter. I recommend it to people of any age."
2,Uhhhh.....,"I read this book during an illness... and I'm only 12 years old so I wouldn't have a very good opinion about this book. I honestly think that this book was not based on the thoughts of a regular teen. Now I am not an average 12 year old.. I take education a little to seriously, but not all teens get kicked out of school( there ALL not THAT ""dumb"" ), smoke(at that age and year ), etc. I don't think this is a very good reprsentation of a ""normal teen"". Holden Caulfield was a very peculiar character. The whole story itself was weird. The book just ended with him deciding to stay home. Maybe it's because I'm young but I didn't really like it ."
1,critsizing reviews,"pardon me , but critisizing other's reviews is wrong it is their oppinion, and they are intitled just as much as you, so lay off. by the way this book was boring and depressing and made me want to take a nap."
1,Horrendous!,"This was a terrible book! Why is it so interesting to hear about a boy who keeps flunking out of school, is let loose in New York, and can only think about sex? I don't see why this is such a classic."
4,Catcher In the Rye was an important book for teens to read,"Every teen in the USA should read Catcher In The Rye because they can relate to it very well.It shows people what a real teen goes through and what he/she faces in life each and every day.This book made me realize that all the phonies in the world are just plain stupid for trying to be someone their not.Holden portrayed a great character of a teenage guy and what problems he sexual goes through.unfortunately, there is alot more in this world today that Holden would not have been able to handle and that many teens do not handle."
2,Love It or Hate It,"This is truly a polarizing book. When you read it, you will either love it, or hate it. I have yet to meet anyone on middle grounds with it. A friend and I actually avoid talking about it because we disagree so much about it.I enjoyed the book for the first chapter or so before repetition of the line ""[x] depressed me"" began to annoy me to no end. I simply could not like Holden, and this is not a book where you can dislike the main character but still enjoy the story.Having read it for an assignment and then having to write an essay, I do appreciate the meaning behind the book. I appreciate and understand how we hate the characteristics in others that most reflect upon ourselves and how desperately one holds on to childhood. I simply could not enjoy the story as much as I liked the meaning behind it."
4,A True Classic,"A Genuine, True Classic. Once you read it again, you realize what a profound effect it had on American literature at the time. What a tragedy that Salinger went into seclusion and deprived the world (except his family) of his talent. Hopefully a family member will publish his work soon.The Catcher in the Rye"
2,This is a literary masterpiece?,"I have heard people rave about how wonderful this book is and I must ask...why? Aside from it being written in a style that a teenager speaks, quite annoying frankly, this book was a bore. If there was symbolism, I didn't catch it. As far as characters go, I like Phoebe better than Holden. I wanted to give up on this book after the first two or three chapters but I read on waiting for the excitement to begin. Needless to say, I was disappointed."
3,Disappointed in a classic!,"I don't believe I came to reading this American classic with huge expectations, I was more intrigued.Frankly, I was disappointed. The reason for my disappointment was that I struggled to develop any empathy for Holden Caulfield, the major character the book is about and is in fact its narrator.There are some good powerful themes that are very much in your face: loss of innocence as one matures, the phoniness of the adult life as one seeks to find our way in the world, the urge to flee as life doesn't meet your expectations, to name a few.Salinger's language is powerful but I just didn't like Holden and accordingly, the 219 pages was a real struggle for me to get through. I imagine in the 50s and 60s, this work was revolutionary, as it dealt with many ""taboo"" issues. The themes are universal and still very relevant today, but I just couldn't like Holden enough for it to keep me sufficiently interested.I won't be recommending it. 2.5 out of 5."
2,Whats all the fuss about?,"I was always curious about this book. I have heard of it for as long as I can remember. I have seen many referencs made to it. And I know there was a relationship with this book tied to Mark David Chapman, the assasin of John Lennon.What I don't understand is what the big deal is about it. It is well written and very discriptive but ultimately seems pointless. It follows a few days in the life of a student expelled from his school and doesn't really go anywhere or make any point. I am not a big reader of fiction so maybe I'm missing something here.All I can say is if you have been one, like myself who has always been curious about ""The Catcher and the Rye"", don't waste your time."
4,It should be read by everyone at least once in their life,"I had to read this book for my english class (11th grade). I thought the book was really great. Being 16 myself I could relate to Holden in many ways. I think Sallinger's writing style is great. His narrative is easy to read and it paints a crystal clear picture of what's going on. Holden does curse a lot, but who doesn't? The one draw back of this book is its ending. But I guess it acts as a symbol of how Holden's life is not wrapped up in one nice little package. Instead, it continues on with its trials and tribulations--nothing is ever perfect."
5,The Greatest Book of all time,"Catcher in the Rye's greatness lies in its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Holden's life is a perfect picture of adolescent male life, in the way he sees the world, in the way he sees himself, and especially in the way he sees other people. His concept of ""phoniness"" describes incredibly accurately the vast majority of adults in the world. Salinger manages to transmit emotions perfectly though Holden to the reader, and can show even the most ignorant, self-absorbed, and phony adults what its like to be a righteously despressed and pessimistic youth in a corrupt world. Holden even beat out Tom Sawyer to become the single greatest literary character of all time."
5,Caulfield not a cynical brat,"I didn't read this book in school, and I haven't discussed it with many people. So I was somewhat surprised to read some reviews claiming that the protaganist, Holden Caulfield, is a cynical brat. Although Holden is certainly frustrated with humanity, he is also desperate to love and to help people. I would identify this internal conflict as the major theme of the book, exemplified by the title."
5,Great Book to Read,Read this book in high school read it and enjoyed it great little story and an easy read. Once you start it you will read it and really enjoy it.
5,Wanted to read every sentence three times at least,"This is a great book, for at least one thing, lots of one star reviwers talked just like Holden, man, How phony was that."
2,Why do peope love this book so much?!,"This book is basically about a 17 year old boy who complains too much. I liked a few of the views he had in the first few chapters, but then it just gets ridiculous.The only interesting thing about this charater is that he lies about things on purpose sometimes.The way the book got its name is good, but the rest is just completely boring and full of useless complaining done by some bitter teenager. (it gets tiring after awhile, y'know)"
2,kind of dull...,"This book was kind of on the dull side and did indeed lack a good solid plot. The cuss words in the book became anoying and where alot of the time out of place. I may be giving this book a bad rating because I was forced to read it in school, but still there are too many good books out there to waste your time on this one."
2,Good example of how people exaggerate things.,"I'm a high school student and I guess it's uncommon that I haven't had to read ""The Catcher in the Rye"". I read it on my own because I've heard a lot about it. It was even mentioned in a movie, ""Conspiracy Theory"". I was disappointed to say the least. I did enjoy some parts, but I think all the hype about it being a classic and all got my hopes up. I frequently found myself trying to discover what the point of the book was. Holden was really just a lazy student who liked scotch. He wasn't unique or dynamic in any way. It's not bad if you have to read it, because then you're at least going to get credit for it."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy reading and I haven't read all the so-called ""classics"" so every once in a while I'll pick one up to see what all the 'fuss' is about and to say that I've actually read it. This way I don't have the bias of teachers and/or professors etc.Perhaps it is my upbringing but Catcher in the Rye, for me, was in a word, boring. Holden Caulfield, to me, was not a ""psychologically challenged"" youth but a whiny teenager who needed a good kick in the pants. It was well written but I found myself continually asking ""what's the point?"" and when I reached the end my reaction was ""That's it?? That's all?"" I suppose 'intellectuals' will insist I missed the point but I will remain off the bandwagon and say that I would not recommend this book."
3,"Not bad, but sometimes way too slow.","Holden was at times interesting, at times VERY boring. He really does ramble and a lot of that rambling has nothing to do with anything. Still a good book, though. Still worth reading."
1,What the F*** just Happened!,"I checked this book out at the library because I have of course never read it or knew anything about it. I'm 29 years old and I wanted to start reading some classics. THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENTS OF MY LIFE! This book is sooo boring! This is the first book I have ever read in my entire life where I could actually put it down and not look forward to reading it where I left off. Most of the time I get a book I read it until I can't see anymore, then sleep and finish it the second day. NOT THIS ONE! I kept hoping there would be a point to all of this bore, that if I just read one more chapter I might find something interesting. Never Happened!! Just wanted to warn everyone in advance! Next on my reading list is the Death of a Salesman, Wish me luck!!!"
1,"Annoying book then, annoying book now","I hated this book in high school and I hate it now. The author uses the words ""anyhow"" and ""old"" and ""to tell you the truth"" so many times on a page that it makes my head throb. Reading the book is like reading one continuous run-on sentence."
5,Brilliant,"This is without doubt the best book I have ever read. I see so much of my cynical self in Holden Caulfield, and I guess many people do - that's why the book is so good. It illuminates even the smallest and seemingly insignificant of human thoughts. Salinger's book is simple yet complex, as is the main character. A joy to read and re-read."
1,because they wouldn't allow me to select zero stars,"I just finished reading The Catcher In The Rye, and I'm very confused. Maybe I took this book too literally, maybe the entire book is symbolic of something other than a kid wondering the streets of NY for a few days. My wife kept asking me how the book was, and I kept telling her that it's boring but something exciting is bound to happen soon. I mean this book is supposed to be great right? Well, nothing ever really happened. This book is very short, but it seems to take forever to read. Perhaps, after years of reading Stephen King books, I've come to expect too much."
2,Slightly Disappointing,I heard so much hype about this book I really thought it was a must read. I was disappointed. It did have some good thoughts but you really can not get that much out of three days in a persons life. There was more swearing than actual writing. Don't read this book for its literary content but for the fact that you can say you read it.
1,Dont Waste Your Time!!!!!!!!!!!,I will tell you right now dont waste your time with this book it is annoying and pointless. There is no plot it is just a stupid mental teenager that needs to shut up really pointless. if you are going to read this for pleasure dont. I doubt you would like it i had 25 people in my class who read it not one gave it a good review and thought there was a point to the book.
1,The Catcher in the Rye,"This book was just plain stupid. I didn't like it at all. Maybe it was just me, but it really didn't make any sense at all."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"Had heard of this book since high school, but never read it. When the author passed away, I decided it was time to buy and read it. Had no idea of what to expect, and was surprised with what it was about. I think the main character had ADHD. I think he was quite intelligent, although he could not make it in the school environment. I tired of the explanation he went into on each topic, but forced myself to finish the book. It was a quick read but did not pass this one on."
3,a little weird,"this book was ok, i guess, my friend loned it to me because she said it was funny and the best book she ever read, i failed to see the humor in it and i didn't think it had much point, but thats just my opinion"
5,A well written story of a character many can relate with.,"Catcher in the rye is a very hauting story, J.D. Salinger has written very well. I could not put the book down. I love this book....."
5,A good book.,"Well I'm 10 pages away from finishing the book and it was a great book. At first I was confused(I kept thinking, ""Ok, he's been kicked out of school so why is he still there?""). But later as I read more it all became clear. I started to be able to relate to Holden. I thought, ""Wow this guy is me in a nutshell."" He's sarcastic, and overall not likeable. He can sniff out a phony before they even open their mouth. I had to read this for my tenth grade English class. At first I was not looking forward to reading this(hey it's summer why should I have school work?) but as I got into I couldn't stop reading it."
2,Not for me,"Although considered a classic, I would not rate this book highly. It has no plot and becomes tedious to read after the first 70 some pages. I think I know why so many people rate the book highly; it does a good job of showing the thoughts of an adolescent on the verge of becoming an adult. But the lack of plot and meaning just ruined it for me. I would compare this book to an abstract painting. I liked it at first because I thought it was original, much like the way abstract painting was original at one point. But after reading the whole thing, it was like I had spent a day going through an abstract art museum."
2,not as great as I thought it would be,I did not like this book. I am a teenager and I found this book very depressing. It was confusing and he told stories that just got off the subject of being in New York and such. This book is not worth reading.
3,I hate books--but this one is good so far,"I havent finished this book yet. I hate reading, but I have to read it for school. I am up to chapter 7 and so far it really is not that bad. He is a messed up kid but who isnt nower days? His cynical views are hilarious!"
1,Worst book I have ever read.,"I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for there to be some reason this book has been banned. But it didn't get better. And I see no reason this is a banned book. The story was not compeling and neither are the characters. How anyone can think this is the best book ever written is beyond me. Please don't waste your time reading this. If you must read it, check it out from the library."
2,Inconsistant but good,"The Catcher in The Rye was a very well outlined book but the auther was very inconsistant with the dialogue for different characters. For example: Holden would say ""goddamn"" a lot in the first part of the book but then he started saying ""chrissake"" and ""hell"". Holden wouldn't say them consistantly like anyother person would have. The book didn't fall into reality enough."
1,It was horrible,"This was a horrible book, with no plot or any good characters. I have no idea why people continue to read it. It uses repetative and pointless language. A filthy and horrible peice of literature, if you can call it literature. The only thing that makes this a classic is that it was once banned, and maybe it still should be."
2,Why do we celebrate the personally weak in society?,"As a Gen X'er I've noticed many people my age who've grown up in the ""self-help"" era to become self absorbed, excuse-making adults. I found Holden Caufield to be weak of character and he reminded me of the afore mentioned people. I struggle with understanding why this particular book has been so greatly celebrated. Is it the same logic that has spawned America's fascination with society's weakest? (Dr. Phil, Jerry Springer, ect...) Are we coddling our children into becoming Holden Caufield's?"
3,a mite overrated,"I am baffled by this novel's standing as one of the great classics of modern literature. It seemed to be essentially a literate exposition of the author's own life experiences, with the liberal pepperings of 'goddamm' and other colloquialisms philological tools within the capacity of any two bit writer. JD was lucky merely in that, as a side effect of his autobiographical catharsis, he tapped deeply into the wellspring of the American psyche. John Le Carre's 'A Perfect Spy' is an example of a truly great once-in-a-lifetime, from-the-heart coming-of-age novel... and he has written a great many more books than Saint Salinger."
3,Has to be read at least once...,"The storyline dragged in some places, and it jumped around an awful lot. Holden's vocabulary was kind of limited, but maybe this was the author's intention? Nevertheless it is a classicthat has to be experienced at least once."
4,Cynical teenager hates everyone and everything.,"Not what I expected, this young man comes across as a 50's anarchist. Except for a few passions in his life, he rebels and criticizes everyone and everything. A true pessimist, his observations have a painfull truth to them that readers can identify with."
3,Everyone can relate,"Holden Caulfield, the main character in this book, is a teenage boy who is trying to figure himself out. He starts out in a boarding school, yet leaves without permission. He then wanders the streets of New York City for 3 days. He encounters a prostitute, bars, girls, and an old professor. At this point in his life, Holden does not have much faith in his fellow race. Even though at times Holden can seem a bit cynical and pesimistic, I liked him and related to him. For anyone who is a teenager, or been through thier teenage years, they can relate to the obstacles Holden faces in one way or another. Yes, the book has an excessive amount of foul language, but if you can see past it, you will find a wonderful story of three days of a teenage boys' life. I would recomend this book for any and everyone."
3,catcher in the rye-a voyage of monsterous proportions,"catcher in the rye, a book, a lengend. the book to me was like a devil hell ride. It boiled my skin like 83 pots of boiling hash oil. the raven cries... laissez-faire! the lights, the carnage.. who wilt cry last when the world shares it horrage with the world. not a story, the CATCHER IN THE RYE is no book, it is a way of life. It engrips your being with the hold of 1 million lumberjacks"
5,Humorous and Insightful,"Extremely humorous.I often found myself laughing out loud while reading the book,and extremely insightful The lead character makes some very insightful observations about the shallowness of adolecent social life I loved it and couldnt put it down A book anyone anyone who has experienced a difficult adolescense can relate to-even looking back ten years after my teens have passed And whats more-its hard to believe this book was written 50 years ago"
4,"Suspensful, exciting, down-to-earth, is my description.",This book is very good and exciting. When you read the first chapter you want to read the rest right away. It is also very emotional and will have you reading a mile a minute.
3,This book didn't keep my interest and Where was the plot?,I felt that this book wasn't very interesting. It didn't keep my interest and I didn't like that idea of a plotless book. I felt that there should be more about the mental institute and the ending was terrible. I didn't want to keep reading and unless I new that he was psychotic and in a mental institute. I probably wouldn't have keep reading. I think they should have given a reason of why Holden Caulfield was entered into a mental institute. The book ended to abruptly.
2,The Catcher In The Rye,"The Catcher In The Rye is a story about a young boy that is having problems at school,with his family,and his friends.This did not catch my attention to well."
2,The Catcher in the Rye was an unadventurous book.,"I believe that the novel could have been written better than what it was. The plot was boring and there was no point. Holden left school for the fourth time, but instead of going home he rents a motel. In the end, he winds up accomplishing nothing and goes home anyway."
4,It was interesting and easy to understand.,I really liked this book. The books we usually read in school are not as easy to indentify with or fun to read. I found the ending quite fustrating because there is really no closure. However I feel that every teenager should have a chance to read this wonderful book.
3,It was ok i thought it really wasn't a true life encounter,This book was in the middle of my least favorites and most favorites. This book didn't seem factual because it didn't seem like a true life story. Nothing that can happen in real life. It was ok but certainly not the best book i ever read.
4,Great Book,I enjoyed the book very much. It had great detail and showed how a teenagers mind thinks. It made you always wonder what was going to happen to Holden. It was easy to read and follow along. I recommend it highly.
2,"Overrated, underdevolped , and trite","After I read this book, I felt incredibly let down. I had repeatedly been told that this novel was the greatest ever. I found Holden to be an immature, spoiled little brat. I also found him very difficult to relate to. It didn't surprise me, however, that so many stalkers and murderers loved this book. I gave it two stars because it wasn't the worst book I have ever read. It was interesting at some points (sort of like watching a car accident)."
4,Definitely a classic,"I have only recently read this book and I must say that I couldnt believe it was written in 1945. The language and the characters are so today that it feels like a story of todays adolescent youth rather than that of 4 decades ago, Also the other characters that Caulfield encounters during the course of the book are so well defined and real that it feels like a part of ones own life - The strange thing about this book is that when you finish it it feels like a very light book but it stays with you, the characters stay with you and it makes a deep impression, but you'll only know it after some time has passed."
4,"Holden Caufield, a seventeen year old,flunks out of school.","It was a wonderful book, but i think it lacked descriptive qualities usually found in other award winning books."
5,This book ROCKS!,"Holden Caulfield may have been placed in a mental institution, but his views on the world are more dead-on than those of any of the ""phonies"" out there who place themselves on pedestals. The novel's dark and seedy style is not for everyone. However, I am a 17-year old boy, just like Holden was at the time he told his story to the psychiatrist, and I can honestly say this book is a must-read for any teenager disgruntled with the self-righteous hypocrites pervading the adult world."
2,"Most interesting, boring book ever written","The Catcher In the Rye held my attention throughout the entire book, yet when I reached the end, I found myself thinking: why was this book written? This book is about how someone perceives teenagers to be clueless and finding fault in everything in his world. I do not believe that all teenager are in fact this way. The writing style of Salinger is fresh, with good wit and power, but the story line is not in-depth enough to have any substance. Holden offers few real insights into a teenage world."
3,Not worth it's iconic status.,"This was the selection for my book club, and it was chosen since it is considered a classic. I'm sure at the time it was a masterpiece, and it feels very authentic, but it doesn't really strike me as timeless. The general view of the club was no one really liked it. I'm glad I read it, since I at least now know, but I would not recommend it nor reread it."
3,"Read the book, but don't take yourself to seriously because you have read it.","I didn't much care for the book if I could pinpoint one thing I had a problem with it has to be the fact that Holden Caulfield is a jerk and a somewhat comical figure really who deserved everything that happened to him.This in and of itself does not make the book a bad book the annoying part is that this is one of those books that attracts a really snobbish fan base think Atlas Shrugged, Brave New World or Lord of the Flies only if you can believe it Catcher in the Rye fans make Aynn Rand fans look sane. To those people I say reading a book that someone else wrote and having a strong opinion about it does not in and of itself make you an intellectual. If Catcher in the Rye was you're introduction to the world of literature I can respect that but there are better books to read once you have finished this one Catcher in the Rye is not the end of the road."
5,Amazing and unique,"This book, to say the least, is very unusual. But I think that's why I love it so much. Holden Caulfield sounds eerily like any teenager you might've run into back then, or even now. This book is completely unique; it doesn't even really have one dignified plot, but instead, many subplots. This book is a page-turner because it's very interesting in the sense that it's about everything in the world, and nothing at all. This is a must-read, and I promise you will never forget it."
2,Did not enjoy,"Read this because a friend told me it was her favorite book. I did not enjoy Holden Caulfield's character at all. He was whiny, obnoxious, and extremely hypocritical (I guess that's the point?), and I just could not look past it."
5,Beautifully written! and true,"I always expected this book to be a long drawn version a teen and phsyco-babble that no teenager would ever use. I was pleasantly suprised. Holden, while frequently cynical, was entertaining and funny. His problems were unique, but he displayed himself just like a teen, and made everyone remember those days growing up."
4,Still thought-provoking,"The Catcher in the Rye is a true classic and has lost little luster with time. I recently read The Triumph and the Glory, about fledling youth thrown into the crucible of war, and one of the characters reminded me of Holden Caulfield, so I read Catcher again. Both books are profoundly moving. They both are coming of age tales, perhaps that's why they stick in my mind together. But by all means read Catcher in the Rye, it is timeless."
1,Annoying,"I despised this book. I found Holden to be arrogant, and one of the most annoying people on the planet. Tthe funny thing is, he's not a person, he's a character, and he truly made me mad. I had to force myself to finish the book because I would become so annoyed with Holden. It's a well written book, but I just could not stand him at all. If you are one to get annoyed very easily then do not read this book. Save yourself from the agony. As far as the story goes, it was okay. Things click with you from here and there... reasons for this, reasons for that. In all, I found nothing spectacular about this book and I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone."
2,The anti Charles Dickens,"The title of the book has no significance to the story.A very poor example of the written English language.The sixteen year old boy calls everyone he refers to as morons when he is a moron and probably doesn't know it.The story has no moral and is a series of disjointed descriptions of the other morons he has met at school.I read the book and at the end asked myself; Why.I'm baffled that a book of this kind would find its way into high school.On second though, that explains a lot about the level of education in the USA."
1,HORRIBLE AND BORING,"THis book should have been called: "" THE BORING MEMOIRS OF TWO DAYS IN A TEENAGER'S LIFE "".. Nothing happens here !! I'm not a little bit shocked by the supoosed "" alienation "" demonstrated by the mais character, the awful Houlden Caulfield. What a waste of time !!"
1,"Boring, boring, boring",What an over hyped piece of crap. I was supposed to have read this in high school but faked my way through it. Now I feel duped for wasting my time on it. The emperor has no clothes and this book sucks.
5,Very entertaining book that most can associate with.,"This book is a thoroughly entertaining look into a lost youth who cannot seem to associate with anyone or anything, and struggles to find any purpose to his or anyone's life. He doesn't seem unlike many people (youths and adults) who don't feel like they connect to anyone, or at best marginally connect with just a few people. The dialog is entertaining, the narration is entertaining, the entire book is entertaining.It's a great story that I feel nobody wants to associate with, but deep down everyone can associate with at least a little bit from one time in our life (and that one time could possibly be now)."
5,I strongly recommend,This book has always been one of my favorites and I even read it 2 times. The author is also one of my favorites and this is his most famous book.
3,Emotions over MIND,"I really did enjoy this book, but it's too far overrated. No way no how is this book worth as much as anything over 4 stars. Too many people are afraid to judge, that's what's wrong here. Emotions over mind. Just like this boy......"
4,Catcher Audio,"Very fast shipping and good packaging. My issue is that the audio is very fast for the first 2-3 discs, then slows down in disc 4 & 5. Noproblem with the cd's, just thought the narrating could be better."
2,And the point is?,"I know this is a classic, which is the reason I read it. To be honest I kept reading only because I thought that at some point, the point would become clear. In the end it just seemed to be the rambling of a bad mouthed kid, and the language was dreadful. I like to think it hasn't been that long since I was sixteen, and I am certain that we (speaking of my peers at the time) did not have that poor a grasp on the english language.I found this book useless, so I assume that I am missing a greater meaning that I am still hoping someone will enlighten me on..."
3,I never got it,"Here's the problem with some classics. In order for everyone else to assume them as classics the thoughtform is that the reader wants to be or is a young White male. I am not any of those so to me Holden spent a lot of time whining. The fact that it also shows up as the book on most nutcases bookcases says a lot about this book.Do I think it speaks to some who need attention and feel left out of the world? Sure. but so does barney if you pay close attention. My stars are for a good first person narrative and its durability over 50 years...Though I do hate writer psychoanalyzation because the very point of fiction is that it is suppose to be made up and not projection. Therefore I consider this good fiction, but not outstanding literature and I will leave the biographical, however salacious, notes on Salingers private peccadilloes for girls that resembled boys and their resemblance to Holden Caulfield up to higher, greater minds than my own."
1,kirby in georgia,"I had heard of this book for many years and was looking forward to a nice read.Wow was I disappointed. It has officially been placed on the top of my list for the books that were a waste of my time to read. I have never been so horribly disillusioned in a book before in my life. It's just a displaced, whineing, pathetic story of a teen with not an once of ambition or positive outlook on life in general. I only gave it a rating of one because there was not an option for zero."
1,The Catcher in the Rye,"Probably the most boring book Ive ever read, sorry nearly read, I couldn't finish it! How did this book ever got published!!!"
4,The Catcher in the Rye,"I thought that this was one of the best books I ever read. It was a summer assignment and I was a little skeptical at first, but I got right into it. Someone once told me that it was one of the most appalling books they ever read because it just talked about how this boy hated everything. I thought that that was what made the book great. It told the truth and people hate hearing the truth becasue they find out that everything is not happy go lucky. Somethings are depressing and sad and J.D Salinger was one of the first people to admit that and I think he did a great job in doing so."
4,a real catcher,"Personnally, I really liked it. It's all about this teenage boy dealing with teenage problems like: what will my future be like and also pressures from his parents. the author wrote just like a teenage boy would talk. This book is extremely alive and refreshing but at the same time, a book that encounters the problems of adolescents."
3,Humorous At Time.,"Having never read this book when I was supposed to in highschool, I realize I never missed anything. Salinger is quite humorous at times but the story overall is agonizingly boring. Maybe if I was a teenager again it would have made a bigger impression. Is it worth reading, the jurys' still out."
2,hated it,"""Catcher in the Rye"" is considered THE book for teenagers. Well I'm a teenager, I read it, and I hated it. It was a boring, pointless narrative of some whiny rich boy complaining about everything he beholds. Maybe I'm missing something, since most teenagers love it, but frankly I don't understand the hype."
1,Tripe...,"While I doubt that this book would rate as meaningful, or powerful enough to be subversive, I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe it's because I can't relate to a spoiled preppie kid. Maybe it's because I read it when I was too old to appreciate it's message. Whichever the case, Holden Caulfield is nothing more than a snot nosed crybaby. I fail to see why Salinger is such an acclaimed writer, either. It's nothing more than an exercise in self indulgence."
1,Am I missing something?,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read! I thought that I was missing out on not reading the ""classics"" while I was in high school....so, I decided to work my way through them now that I'm in my 30's. If this book is an example of what I will be getting into, I'll stop now. The Holden charactor rambled on and on about things, jumping from one subject to another and mainly focusing on his self absorbed thoughts of life and people. I felt nothing but distaste for him because he was such a whiner that wanted to blame everyone else for his laziness. At the end of the book all I wanted to do was say ""WAAAAAAAA!"". How in the world do these books get a classification of being a ""classic""????"
2,we all have problems,i've read the history of this book and what's it's about. and i have to say that it's just plain uninteresting. being holden's age and went through dramatic experiences i feel that it's too boring. basically a boy named holden get's kicked out of school again. everything is a recap of everything he does after he gets kicked out. the charecter keeps changing from past tense to present and it get's hard to follow the story.
2,"Annoying, Depressing, No Plot","Classics come and classics go, and this classic should never have been. A man going through a depressive time in his life is not a good story unless his depression brings about side stories, as does occur in 'Invisible Man' by Ralph Ellison. This book seems to go nowhere leaving the reader to continue to hope for the expected conflict that never transpires. 'The Catcher in the Rye' is quite a disappointment."
3,The Catcher in the Rye,"A troubled teen is captured in Holden. Paranoid, self abosorbed an confused, Holden can only trust his younger sister. Everyone else is too ""phony."" Holden undertakes these psychological roller coasters only to find himself back where he started.The slang used in the story brings the words to life and makes the character real to the reader. J.D. Salinger's writing offers a dramatic and innovative glimpse, depicting this emotionally unstable teen."
4,Isn't Phoebe good girl?,"I know Mister Holden just couldn't understand a kind of principle, that is a necessary lying in society(in Japanese Tatemae).by the way, sometimes I feel jealous Mister Holden, because he has real good brother and sister, doesn't he?what is he doing in spite of having smart bro and cute sis? actually Mister Holden Caulfield was real dismal kid!!however, I can't hate him, because something of his character is just like me, I guess so."
2,Holden Caulfield is whiny,"For me this book was one of those sacred cows that you're not allowed to say anything bad about without being ridiculed. Everyone is supposed to love this book. How can you be an intellectual and not love Salinger? Well I may not be an intellectual, but I certainly did not like this book. Holden Caulfield does nothing but whine about how life is not fair and moan about where the ducks have gone. I know the ducks are a metaphor, but I just did not care. Holden Caulfield is immature, even for his young age, and I found him so miserable that I couldn't enjoy the book. He does nothing but complain and stew in shallow teenage angst. This book seems to be loved by millions of people so others must enjoy something in it that I didn't. I just wanted to provide my opinion because many people just gush over this book, and it only annoyed me. I'm sure it's a classic for a reason. I just didn't enjoy it at all."
2,HOLDEN IS A SPOILED BRAT,"Who cares what a rich spoiled brat thinks of the world? Holden should stop whining for a second and wake up to realize the world doesn't revolve around him. If you want real literature, read Steinbeck and Dickens."
1,Whiner in the Rye,"I read this book when I was about 14 or 15 and I just re-read it at the age of 48, thinking I probably would get more from it now that I'm older. I didn't. I am an educator and I can't help but wonder why in the world this book is on so many recommended reading lists. There are scores of much better written and more worthwhile books. Try reading ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" for instance. I can't help but wonder if ""Catcher"" was part of Salinger's journal at some point. It sure didn't take any stretch for him to create the plot, setting, or characters in this novel."
3,Not For Me,"Add this one to the pile of classics that weren't for me. This was another one in my banned or challenged list. While the story was ok, I never found a point to it. It seemed to lack a plot or something. It was an easy read, but I was extremely glad when it was over!"
4,This is a book that I recommend to everybody,"The Cathcher in the rye is a book that I recomend to people my age (15 years)or older. This is the age when we are experiencing so many changes and we don't understand them, just like holden. The author make us emphatetic. The only thing I did't like about the book was it's ending. Because is kind of an intense book that has apretty long Climax, and then the aouthor writes a prety weak ending."
4,It was a good book and I enjoyed a lot.,"I think that the catcher in the Rye is a good book. I enjoyed a lot while I was reading it. I recomend this book to high school students and adults because it has a lot of disscussion, many points of view of Holden and makes us realize and think about the real world we are living in. It was an iteresting book but I wws very dissapointed with the ending."
4,It is a pleasure to read this book.,It is a pleasure to read this book. Salinger has showed us a fine analysis of the problem with the adolescence and he was so genius to write this story in a style of young people. You read the first side and you can't stop reading it. Isabel Daum
3,"Good, but not great.","I believe much of the hype of this book has to do with the time of release. Many things shock us based on our culture at the time. This book would not be a 'blip on the radar screen' if released today. Overall a good piece of work, but not as epic today."
3,I Just Don't Think I Get it.,"I have just finished reading this book and honestly, I am not quite sure what the point of it all was. Holden just didn't seem ""messed up"" enough for me. If he was more dysfunctional, with a bad history and more serious problems, I think I'd appreciate it more. But he just seems like another slacker I might come across at any time. I think if the book was to be edited, omitting the parts that were not significant; those parts which just basically padded the book with unneccessary chapters, it'd be about 100 pages. Plus, the ending didn't satisfy me. It wasn't a book I could ""sink my teeth into"". I guess I think this way because I started reading it assuming it would be great, and it was anticlimactic."
1,The What in the Where?,"Without meaning to be critical, cynical, nor harshly judgmental, ""The Catcher In The Rye"" compels me to ask: Why do schools and libraries encourage teens and young adults to read this senseless dribble about (what I perceived to be) a critical, cynical, and harshly judgmental antagonist? Frankly, and unfortunately, I was not too pleased with the book's plot (or lack thereof). Simply put: It did not make any sense, and I, as a reader, did not feel remorse nor sympathy for the principle character. His repetitiveness was viewed as immature, as well as his cussing and judgmentalism were irresponsible. Not exactly good examples I would set for any upcoming generation of young readers. I was unable to figure out the author's reason(s) for writing such a ""critically acclaimed"" classic, and I could not care to. My opinion of this book is that it's not worth the read. I would not recommend it to anyone, not even to a dog."
5,My favourite,"I am a reader from Germany. In my mind this book is one of the best I ever read. The reader is able to feel, what the main charakter feels. If you are reading this novel you are Holden himself. I can't stop reading, because I was really moved by this novel. There's no part in this book, you are boored while reading it. The way Salinger wrote the novel is really fantastic. It is written in a very lively stile. It's a really moving story, describing a young boy having a lot of problems. After, and while reading, you start thinking over all the characters in this novel, and about human beiing.I also started reading a german translation which is really terrific, 'cause the way the translator interpret the story is not the way Salinger wanted us to interpret the story. But this is only my own opinion. Please read this novel and build up your own."
2,Thoroughly overrated.,"Teenage angst at its peak, told in a way that did not make me sympathize with the main character. The writing was just as confused as the character's mind, which was probably the intent, but did not enhance my understanding of the point of the book. Which, by the way, I never did -- unless the point was only to get a murky feel for what goes on in a teenager's mind. I do not understand the cult following this book has achieved."
2,Pointless story with little insight,"I was looking for a good book to read when I came across this recommendation with high ratings. Surely a book with this high of a rating must be very good!I was very disappointed! In short:Pros:Salinger's good writing style makes for easy reading.Cons:Poor story line. There's not much to this book. No interesting plot. As others have said, the hole story is Holden gets kicked out of school, goes to NY & gets drunk and goes home.No insight or learning. There's nothing to be learned from this book. This is not a coming of age story or anything interesting.At the end of the book I thought I wasted my time reading this book when I could be reading something more worth while."
2,Extreme,"The book describes an extreme case of confusion when a person leaves childhood. It expresses the emotions like Munch's painting, The Scream."
5,I loved it!,"I read this book in one day, it's so good. I know to many of you avid readers out there, reading 1 book in a day might not be that much of an accomplishment, but hey, I don't read all that much.Maybe it's just because I'm a 14 years old boy so many of the things in this book I can connect with, but this book, IMO, just has everything. It'll make you laugh out loud time and time again and it has writing that is actually clear and easy to understand (unlike a lot of my reviews). I definately recommend this book to anyone and everyone, but especially to guys like me that can actually connect with many events that are happening within the book."
2,catcher in the rye,This book wasnt very interesting. I couldnt relate to the character and his personality he was negative most of the time thinking everyone but himself were phony. I dont recommend this book because it doesnt grab your interest.
1,Habitually taking the Lord's name in vain!,"After hearing about how wonderful this book was, I was very disappointed when it was my turn to turn the pages. The writer, throughout the entire novel, habitually takes the Lord's name in vain. Why!? What's the point? What was he trying to prove?! I was ""required"" to read for class, but would rather risk a poor quiz grade then be exposed to such derogatory and offensive language. Even if the language was improved, the story is boring. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but each page turned proved just as dull; a complete disappointment and waste!"
1,A Classic?,"I like to read classics that I have never read before. This one looked interesting and heard lots about it over the years for it. Not sure why it is a classic. I agree with other reviewers that maybe this had more meaning when it was first published. The constant swearing and repetitive dialogue was beyond irritating. A quarter of the way through the book I disliked the Holden so much I was hoping for a suicide, but unfortunately, he continued on and on and on. Not all books are considered timeless."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"unlike most artistic works touted as profoundly significant this one fails to live up to the hype without seeming pretentious as a result. it doesn't seem very ambitious. just a light easy read without much there to either praise or criticize. far from the angry loner the character is said to represent Holden Caulfield seems basically laid back and content, more average than intense. it's an engaging read once you get past the first chapter, and maybe that's not a compliment to be sneezed at since so few books really seem to actually hold my attention, but it's nothing more than that. it didn't make me think."
5,My favorite book of all time,"This novel has so many great qualities. I don't know what it is but whenever I think Holden, I think of it as a reflection of myself. Obviously everyones favorite part of the novel is the middle, Holdens sexual exploration. the thing is though, that he's still a virgion by the time the book ends, it is his way of catching kids from falling out of the field of Rye, where Holden would dream of suddenly becomming Peter Pan and taking kids with him to neverland where you never had to grow up, which is that night of his exploration in New York he passes up several sexual oppertunitees.The novel was about ten to fifteen years ahead of it's time with Holden noticing societies flaws and urban decay, in which the film ""Taxi Driver"" comes into mind. But that's another story. Several essays have been written on ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" and if you want to check them out then I suggest you look for ""Readings on 'That Catcher in the Rye'"" have fun!"
1,"I really, really tried....","I just don't get the hype... Yes, I've read the whole thing (in h/s and in my adult life) but, for something that has been touted as one of the greatest novels ever written it sure is a tough read! And it's not that it was above my head, it was just plain old poorly written in my humble opinion. The grammar was beyond horrible. I think my 10 year old son could've done a better job.I wanted to like this, even love it because we've always been told about what a ""classic"" and ""must read"" it was... but, in the end, I was just miserable.Sorry, but, I know I can't be the only one to feel this way, right?"
1,Holden would have been a perfect fit for MTV Real World...,"...and I can't stand that show as well. Not as a teenager, and not as an adult.I read this revered classic to check off classic readings I was never exposed to in High School. I force fed this into my brain up to Chapter Four, then the nausea of reading the whiny Holden forced me to put it down.A quick summary?""An emo pity party""Holden depicts nothing I was like as a teenager, and for that matter, nothing like my peer group when I was a teenager. I had a tough life, and yes, I was filled with the typical teen angst, but my peers and I did something about it. If you are entertained by whiny people who have little drive in life and lack the motivation to be productive member of society, this book is for you.Or just turn on MTV Real World, it's pretty much the same mindless swill but in video format."
3,"Well-written, but seems dated",My impression of the book was that it was well-written but many of the ideas and concepts were very dated. Supposedly there has been a lot of controversy surrounding this book because of the deviant nature of the main character. Judged by today's standards....the violence in the movies and video games are much worse.
3,LOTS OF INFO,"this dvd is 3 hours long, but broken into 2 parts (1.5 hours each) this video talks about MANY different things and will have to be watched a few times with like-minded friends to grasp some parts. a few parts did not make any sense to me (measuring the potential of water... potential to do what? how is this being measured?) and seemed to lack information. but maybe after i watch this again with my friend, we will be able to bounce ideas off of eachother and gain a better understanding. overall i am glad i bought it. its packed with interesting info, but its not as high quality a video (with visuals) as ""The Secret"" or ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" or ""Spirit Space"". hopefully i will grasp more of the information in this the next time around!"
3,"Good, Ugly and Bad",Good video with a lot of information. The transcition between the topics is not very smooth. It is more like a spirtual tale of a lone ranger.
1,maybe a defective DVD?,"If this isn't a defective DVD, then absolutely not worth the money. NO visuals at all, just a blank screen with the producer's name on it and a picture of a sun. The audio was good, but no introductions and no visuals or labels, so impossible to know who was talking. Confusing. I've seen much better DVDs on these subjects."
2,"Fun, but terribly terribly left wing biased to a nauseating point","Title says most of it, not to say that the people interviewed are so blatantly, Marxist, but the creator and narrator are embarrassingly Marxist almost Communist and he keeps pushing this crap as if its real. I have to admit that some of the responses are interesting to listen too."
5,A Lifeline for Parents,"This book will provide a lifeline to parents struggling with children who they suspect, or in fact are, abusing drugs or alcohol. It provides a lot of useful information on resources and approaches for help but most importantly speaks from the author's years of experience working with youth and families involved in drug abuse. The personal stories are very helpful. This book doesn't point the finger at parents but provides instead some very practical help. If you have found out your child is abusing drugs,read this book first before any others-it will definitely get one moving in the right direction to get further help. I would recommed this book to all parents as its principles apply to other struggles parents encounter with teens and none of us are immune to our children getting in trouble with drugs."
5,Pertinent info,"This book should be back in print, it addresses all of the issues of an adolescent addict."
5,I liked this CD because of the songwriting and production.,"The Kaisers' latest CD, ""Wishing Street"", is their best so far. The songs are well written and the excellent production faithfully recreates the sound of the British Invasion era. Their singing style is influenced by the Beatles and the Searchers, but doesn't mindlessly mimic the sounds of those bands. ""Wishing Street"" provides a refreshing, exciting, and thoroughly pleasurable listening experience."
1,Incorrect volume,"The contents of this reprint are actually Elements of Hebrew by an Inductive Method by Rainey, not Elements of Hebrew SYNTAX by an Inductive Method by Rainey. It looks like Nabu press reprinted the wrong volume."
3,What happened when I was reading it?,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. I thought ""What a wonderful, fresh piece of writing!""But then something happened when I came to the middle and I completely lost interest, so much so that I found myself skipping big chunks of it just to get to the end. Even the end I couldn't digest properly.Perhaps I just didn't like the setting on the ship. Perhaps because it started to get too wordy. Don't know."
1,Don't Bother.,"I never bothered to read the middle. The ending was ridiculous and dumb; it was also depressing and made me wonder why we couldn't have a happier ending after the heroine had improbably survived several violent episodes. The beginning sounded too much like a sex and shopping novel, and the sex described sounded anatomically impossible. Too bad, because it might have been an interesting book if it had been less trendy and less materialistic.I am once again thankful that I check out the endings to see if the book is worth reading. I find that a good book is still good when I know whodunnit or what happens."
2,About as interesting as watching water freeze,"Smilla's seems to be the only person who realizes that the death of a young boy is not an accident, and she persues the truth relentlessly, and I mean relentlessly, until she uncovers a vast conspiracy. In the meanwhile, she gets bruised and banged up, nearly dies several times, and has the weirdest sex I have ever heard of. (Don't get the wrong idea, there's nothing particularly titillating in ""Smilla' Sense of Snow."")I gave this book 2 stars because I like intelligent protagonists. Other than that, I thought it was way too long and I had a hard time keeping all the bad guys straight. Plus, I like mysteries where the reader has a least some small chance of figuring out what's behind it all, and with ""Smilla"" I had little to go on. My advice: say ""no"" to ""Smilla's Sense of Snow."""
2,Smilla's Sense of Snow is a Story of Slush!!,"I was extremely excited to read this and what a letdown!! Between the Greenlandic/Danish names and terms w\ 20 letters in them and the shallow characters (barring Smilla) it was no wonder it took a couple weeks to trudge through this. Big hype led to bigger disappointment. I finished it (finally!!) and in retrospect, asked myself 'What did I just read about for 2 weeks??"
1,"In this case, see the movie first","Peter Hoeg displays some original insights during the reflective moments of this novel, however, this is neither a 'thriller' nor is it purposeful. As is often the case with poor storytellers, you never get a feel for where this story is going, and that alone makes for evenings of masochism with this book. I rate this as the worst book I read in 1997; Joseph Heller's 'Something Happened' was a close second"
4,GREAT FIRST HALF,"This novel has the best first half of any mystery I have ever read, and I've read dozens. Then it gets weird and nonsensical toward the end. But the writing is great, the setup is great, and Smilla is a great character. She is brave and driven by her love for a boy who is not her son. This was a huge international bestseller in its day, and it is still worth reading."
4,This book is an eye-opener!,"The author should be thanked personally for allowing me into a world I didn't know existed-- what better compliment can one give a writer in this jaded world? I never dreamed of the racial and ethnic tensions between the European Danes and the Inuit people. So much for vaunted Scandanavian progress and culture. Also, since the fall of the Soviet empire, I have felt suffocated but the smugness of all us capitalists-- at last, I read about a character who is not the least impressed with our hollow victory. What a relief! This novel is not always easy to follow, and the end is a mess, but what a wonderful read"
2,Much over-rated,"This book was recommended to me by a local bookstore owner, who said that it was stunning. I read it, slogging through most of it, as if it were the snow Hoeg writes about. It was stunningly mediocre. I did not like, understand, or emapthize with any of the characters, and I was happy when I finished"
3,"Fantastic first two-thirds, abominably bad ending","Authors are all too often struck by the dreaded 'Two-thirds syndrome' -- the problem of how to maintain the suspense of a good book until the very end. All too often, about two-thirds of the way into a novel, you can almost hear the question reverberating around an author's head: ""How on earth am I going to end this?"" One of the best examples of this must be Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow, a mystery which also does a superlative job of charting the alienation of a Greenlander in Copenhagen. Just as you're gearing up for a fantastic conclusion, the author turns it into a cheap spy novel and ruins much of what he has achieved. I am still puzzled by how bad the ending of this book is when you consider what went before"
4,An Unusal Thriller,"A unigue premise, an unusual heroine, and the author's back-ground combine for a great book. Learn more about Greenland andmore words for snow than you ever thought you needed. This bookalso contains one of the all-time-greatest lines ever spoken bya character. Enjoy."
3,Perfect read for snowy winter! Unsatisfying end...,"I was given this book and kept for about one year until I found the perfect opportunity: snowed-in, blizzard outside, in my bed on a cold chicago winter day. I read in one day and enjoyed it. Smilla's journey through her quest to discover who killed her little friend is intertwined with her flashbacks to her past and an all too familiar love story...Unpredictable, although a bit clich√©, the book does manage to keep the reader interested till the end.Some details become a little too tiring and the author gives away too much information about the characters instead of letting us feel who they are through their actions. The end would puzzle and piss off many people but, hey, if only we could design our own end."
4,Overall a good read,"I liked this book, even though I found Smilla totally unbelievable as a character, and the early pages rough going. I soon discovered that you did not really have to read every word so very carefully. I wondered if I was reading a bad translation until I read some of the other comments here. But, it IS possible to skim this book and still enjoy it. The Denmark of this book does not remind me of the Denmark I know, and that also bothered me. I read it on the plane to and from Scandinavia. By the time they left for Greenland 3/4s through, I couldn't put it down. The ending is a brief, sharp disappointment, but on balance it's still a good read"
2,Very very wordy and complex,"This story grabs you from the beginning and takes you on a visual feast with words however it gets really complicated and takes many different directions. Some of the information is technical in nature which requires detailed explanation in the book and since this particular author likes to use lots and lots of words, it takes a long time to get through the story. In fact, the story takes many directions, including going backwards but the only story it does not seem to finish is the one that was started. I had to read this for a book club and did not give it good recommendations in our book club review either. I did enjoy the visual explanations of the country it was set in so much that I felt that I was there."
2,A weird book to say the least,"Maybe I'll understand the movie better. The title intrigued me. I generally love to read about Native cultures around the world, their religious beliefs and survival techniques. This book had interesting aspects relative to Native culture but the rest was just weird. It will be awhile before I tackle the reading of another Peter Hoeg novel."
2,Smilla's Sense of Snow,"The transaction was A+. Perfect. The book itself? Not so good. Story had real possibilities. But the author went on too long, very wordy. convoluted plot that was not necessary. Oh well, the price was right; .01."
5,Scandinavian Thriller,They are habit-forming these Scandinavian thrillers. There is just the right amount of convolution so as to not get lost in that icy fog that so affects these Norse tales. They've been practicing the genre since the Edda and just keep getting better and better. Maybe it's the long nights!
4,Suspenseful! Drew Me Right In!,"I found this to be an incredibly well-written book! Full credit also goes to the translator, Tiina Nunnally. I found it necessary to remind myself that I was reading a translation of Hoeg's original work.The characters were interesting and well-developed. I was quickly caught up in this story and felt myself, like Smilla, wanting to get to the bottom of the mystery. I found the combination of the mystery of Isaiah's death and the political intrigue to be very compelling. I couldn't put the book down!This book would have been a ""five star"" book for me but the ending let me down. It didn't come to enough of a conclusion for me. I wanted there to be more.I will definitely read another book by Hoeg."
5,One of my favourite books,"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. Well, partly because I can DEFINITELY relate to Smilla Jaspersen in terms of personality. It's told from a very personal point of view, and starts out rather slowly, but the pace does pick up. There's quite a lot to learn from the book if you don't mind all the technical mumbo-jumbo. It seems that people either love it or hate it. I say Grab It!"
3,"Great start, shocking ending","I don't understand what happened towards the end of this book. We know Hoeg can write, can conjur up some astonishing images, so why did he end it so sloppily and so lazily? Another disappointment"
3,Meh,I checked out this book from the public library after reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest by Stieg Larsson. I read some review which compared the two books. I did not think the books were similar. The first half of Smila's Sense of snow was well written and interesting.The second half I read because I wanted to know who killed the little boy. I read it out of curiosity not enjoyment.The ending was a total disappointment.
1,A poor snow job,"I found this book to be too long, too humorless and too stodgy to bear. I made it halfway through, and although I did find the mystery intriguing and the idea original, the cardboard characters, because of the monotonous and unimaginative descriptions, and the perpetual whining of Smilla, I didn't have a snowball's chance in the Equator of getting any furthur."
3,A Good Thriller Drowned in Words,"I bought this book because of the good reviews on Amazon and love reading particularly a well told story. Hoeg has great skill, but this story died due to the excessive descriptive writing about snow, ice and extremly cold weather. I felt like the ship they described slogging through artic waters. The ending left me cold."
2,Snow good,"I heard great things about this book. Frankly, it started off really good. What happened to the little boy? How are all of these shady characters involved? What's beneath the ice up there in Greenland? As this book became more and more confusing, I cared less and less about that stuff. And then when U find out... LET DOWN! The big climax was a big bomb! KA-POW!!! It does get 2 stars. One for interesting sciency stuff. And another for Smilla, who -- after all was said and done -- is a real kewl gurl. Just like me!"
1,"A kid gets killed, Greenlanders have it tough, and","snow melts in predictible ways. There's nothing much other than this; yet the dull words plot on and on, and the annoying characters whine. From the prior reviews, you either loved this book or hated it. After over 250 pages, I still can't understand the raves."
1,What's all the fuss about?,"From these reviews, it seems that readers either love or hate this book. Frankly, I found it more than tedious and mired in murky, self-important writing, and more than boring."
3,Overrated,"I'd like to give this book 2 1/2 stars out of five, because it's half good. It's stylistically engaging, and a few of the central characters (especially Smilla, as the narrator) are richly drawn and fascinating. And as the plot begins to unfold and the puzzle pieces are laid out one by one, the question of how they will all connect pulls you along relentlessly.But halfway through - when the setting changes from Copenhagen to a large cargo ship heading toward Greenland - the story begins to lose its way. New characters are introduced which are merely caricatures, their motives and actions become less and less plausible, until by the end we no longer believe anything, and the entire plot, rather than being wrapped up in a satisfying conclusion, simply disintegrates into nothingness."
1,What is going on???,"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker--raving about the herroine in the plot and how powerful the plot is. WHAT was she talking about? Maybe the plot was lost in the transaltion, but I found the book boring and hard to follow. I kept losing track of what was going on and who was who? After a few chapters of complete confusion, I finally put it down without finishing it. I did happily hand it over to my father--a well-read and educated man. I thought maybe he would appreciate this recommendation, but he as I could not follow the events, and said goodbye to the story before the end."
1,Most boring book I've ever finished,"I was told how great a book this was. I read it, expecting to be enthralled. It was a struggle--Idecided to finish it, but at no point did I get it. The characters were unbelievable; Smilla'spsychobabble was just annoying; her constant commentary on different words for ice and snow waspretentious; her adventures were preposterous; and the plot was ultimately a disappointment. Smillaand all the characters in it are depressing bores. Maybe you need the Scandinavian sense of doomto appreciate this book. In my opinion, it was definitely the worst."
2,Not What it Could Have Been,"The author weaves a complex tale and stirs some powerful images. Chock full of historical and scientific tidbits, the books falters in character development. The actions and motives of the major players are highly implausible, and glossed over too frequently. And there is no plot resolution at all. I was listening to this book on tape and I was certain there had to be more...but there isn't. A good read, albeit flawed, and entirely unfinished. Write your own ending!"
3,Good storyline and plot twists,"Smilla's search for the reason why a young boy runs to his death while the authorities rule it an unfortunate accident makes for a good story. The most interesting and flowing parts of this book surrounded the characters in action. The development of most the characters is too brief causing acceptance of them versus getting to know them. The scientific and environmental detail while necessary and compelling at some points unfortunately more often detracts from the storyline. A little more editing of the story would have helped, and yet at times the text jumps forward causing the reader to fill in the blanks. These inconsistencies are a bit distracting. Overall this not a bad read, I just was expecting more due to the hype about best book of the year. Plot twists are intriguing and creative. Do enjoy this book."
3,Win a Date With Smilla,"If you always wanted to read the encyclopedia all the way through but never thought you had the time, Smilla is the woman for you. She knows something about everything, and don't think for a minute that she won't tell you. This lady has more adventures than you can shake a stick at, PLUS she has a nasty habit of pinching, grabbing and inserting things where they may not belong. I don't think I'm the only one who got an X-Filesish feel from this book, especially at the end. I cheated and listened to Smilla on audiotape, but Alyssa Bresnahan's performance is worth checking out if you have 17.75 hours of spare time or you can listen at work like me."
3,Not my kind of story,"I ordered this book because it was assigned as book club reading. It was well enough regarded to be translated from the Danish and is about an Icelandic outsider and her quest to find an answer. The mood was dreary and the tone was negative. I actually finished it, but it was not fun. I didn't like the story but other people have--it was even made into a movie."
2,"beautiful images of ice & snow, but not much else","Why, oh why was I tricked into reading this? The title is beautiful, but I didn't care for any of the characters. I admired Smilla's independence, but in general, the book left me cold."
2,Hated It,"I will give this book a three because it was obviously well-written. I also found the beginning interesting - who ever knew that Greenlanders are a detested minority in Denmark? Also, in the interest of disclosure, I admit that I much prefer a novel to a mystery. However, I absolutely suffered through this book. Nearly everyone in my book club hated it also. We now refer to it as the Insufferable Smilla!"
3,A Book for those with lots of patience...,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. But at 499 ice-and-darkness filled pages, it was a bit too long. I also found myself constantly flipping back and forth to understand what was going on in this mystery...the names and dates got a little confusing, but maybe I'm just culturally illiterate. Smilla herself was an interesting duck, but images of Julia Ormond kept flashing through my mind, spoiling her tough, self sufficient character. The end of this book was terrible! After slogging through hundreds of pages of scientific and oilfield-type data, I ended up with worms and a meteorite...what was Peter Hoeg thinking? I give this book a 6 for the great, new heroine and the interesting first half of this story. However, this isn't a book for skimmers, or those with light reading pleasure in mind"
2,"First half is great, Second half is horrible","Once you get used to the time shifts in the plot, the book is engrossing. Unfortunately, just around that time the plot falls apart and goes way downhill leaving you with an ending that is disappointing. Not worth the time"
2,"Dull, more or less","This book wants to be several things at once: a thriller, a political commentary, a philosophical treatise, an evocation of the aesthetics of snow. Unfortunately for the reader it succeeds in none of these genres. The book is at least two hundred pages too long; the plot is unrealistic and, for long patches, quite boring. Hoeg has succeeded in creating a compelling character, mainly because Smilla is so perpetually cranky and cynical. One also learns about the status of Greenlanders of Denmark, which mirrors that of many other immigrant populations in countries around the world. Overall, however, I found this book immensely disappointing and more or less a waste of time. I did learn that one can appreciate subtleties in the world of ice but had little enjoyment while doing so. For a _real_ novel that successfully marries politics with a stirring story and fine, evocative writing, read Charles Powers's ""In the Memory of the Forest."""
5,Very interesting!,I liked this book very much! What else can I say! It's wonderful and my impressiones are so great!!! I'm happy to have this book at my home!!!
4,A thriller with strong themes of cultural displacement,"As a thriller this book fails to catch fire. With a strong character like Smilla, a bit of humour and some deep reflections the book is more of a force. Much of the first half of the book deals with Smilla's feeling of being uprooted from her close-to-nature Greenlandic culture and the clash with being a modern Dane. I liked the mix of moods in this book. Here identification with the dead Inuit child gave the central character more substance and a high moral standing. A more believeable book results. Another thriller The Big Picture by Douglas Kennedy fails at the hurdle of moral ambivalance. On the other hand it is more readable. The literary weight of the Smilla story should not deter as the second half of the book sees a dramatic rush of action. Overall the mood of the book is pleasing and worth taking time to read."
4,20 ways tyo describe snow,"It is not the danish, who has 20 ways to describe snow! It is people from greenland, who so many ways to describe snow. Smila is half danish, half greenish ;-) Thats why she know so much about snow. If u want to read a fine book u should look for Michael Larsens ""the snake in sydney"" another briliant danish writer"
2,Smilla's sense of snow,There was a defective tape in Smilla's sense of snow I was disappointed but I will not return it the rest were ok
1,200 pages too long!,"Maybe something was lost in translation, but this story is too convoluted and long, and I could not waste another hour reading it. Bailed out half way through it!"
1,Bad writing; even cheesier plot,"I never thought I'd think an action-packed book like this was BORING--but that's exactly what it was. Hoeg was so focused on jamming in every single twist he could think of into the plot that I lost interest in the characters! I absolutely hated the second half of the book--no reflections, no insights, no interesting character moments."
4,Smilla's Sense of Story,"The strange conglomeration of science fiction, political activism, and suspense treats the reader to a very different kind of book. I could not put it down at times; at other times passages did seem to drag on. Hoag has a gift for character development, apparent in the portrayals of Benja and the Mechanic. I found the description of setting to be fantastic, especially in the flashbacks to Greenland. Someone like myself, who did not know much about Denmark and even less about Greenland, would learn very much from this book thanks to the numerous descriptons of the people, the weather, and their societies. My one complaint is that the transition between the two halves of the novel was not smooth; it almost felt as if two different books. Overall I found this to be a very engaging and intriguing novel."
5,A Deep and thoughtful book,"From the beginning till the end, Peter Hoeg takes you on ajourney where you will get glimpses and ideas of the ending during theway. A very flowing book with a protagonist that goes throughpersonal suffering of both herself and the people she knows. Smilla sacrifices everything to bring justice to a friend who she believed was forced to jump off a roof. An enjoyable novel for anyone who likes the work of Peter Hoeg or is interested in a story with more depth."
2,Don't be fooled,"This novel that I wanted very much to like, and which came highly recommended by readers whom I respect. However, even though I tried and tried again, I simply could not get into Smila's Sense of Snow.At first I thought I just wasn't getting it so I redoubled my efforts. The slow pacing, the symbolism, the endless philosophical musing - is there a point? Or am I just missing it? But in the end, this is a novel that tries to be everything at once but simply ends up spinning its wheels.Hoeg tries a bit of everything, from veiled psychological motives to philosophy to action scenes complete with fiery explosions, and even a bit of sci-fi - but the net effect is simple boredom. It was sheer determination that kept me turning the pages. Summary: boring, pretentious, overwritten, unbelievable. Hoeg tries to pull the wool over our eyes hoping we'll mistake the glacial pacing and opaque philoso-babble for profound thought. Thoughtful readers won't be fooled."
3,"Interesting read, left me cold","Smilla is a fascinating, if obnoxious, character. Her journey to find out what the true cause of her little friend's death holds some real fascination. Frankly if the last two chapters had held up to the rest of the book, I'd be giving it five stars. Unfortunately the author fails to provide any resolutions. At the end all is known, but nothing is settled. Our heroine is stranded in more senses than one; vindicated, but unable to do anything about it. I wanted to send the author an excerpt from Orson Scott Card's book on novel writing - the section where he discusses how and when to end a book - because this wasn't the way to do it."
5,Low Carb Beanut Butter Crunch Bars,The best Low Carb bar I ever tasted. Why did they ever stop makeing them?
5,super for in the classroom or self study,"I have been teaching English for years in various countries,with various methods, and this book is a tried and true stand by.Pretty well anything with the Murphy name on it will effectivelydrill the grammar patterns into even the thickest of heads, and its not toodry either. Everything is covered here, from prepositions to perfect tenses.If you teach, I'd recommend getting all 3 levels as well as the supplementaryexercise books for last minute lesson bolstering.Also, if like me, you are tirelessly trying to improve the English of yoursignificant other, this is an excellent tool. It is so painless that I have evenseen my boyfriend flipping through parts of it himself (in secret of course).Bottom line: teaching or self study you cant go wrong with Murphy."
2,I found several grammer errors in this book,I thought this workbook would help reinforce proper grammer usage. I've found several grammer errors in the book. I haven't found the book to be very useful.
4,"Alright, but 45 can do better","Ive seen this guy rock some mean live shows, however this album onlys good with few tracks. Opening up with Bad Company and Ram Trilogy sets the mood for some hard hitting tracks, but after that, 45 goes to some older jungle tracks."
1,Masturbatory,How terribly self-congratulatory this book is. All the people in it conveniently seem to forget that the live within the confines of an advanced capitalist consumer society. The idea that other cultures have an equal voice with western imperialism is ridiculous. The book would be more offensive if it weren't so ignorant. It's We Are The World for the ipod set.
4,Great source of information!,So far I have found this to be an excellent source of information on non-profit GAAP. The book is easy to read and is very thorough.
3,Toddler Toothbrush,Kinda disappointed in how quickly the brushes flattened out. I'll try a different product for his next toothbrush. As a rule I find Safety 1st products great.
1,"Very flimsy, even for an 18 month old.",My 18 month old son destroyed this toothbrush in one week. The head / bristles are falling apart. We have already thrown out one of the two brushes and the second one will be gone in another week. Very poor quality product.
3,fresh possibilities,"The imagery of the bible has always fascinated me...it's all so similar, it seems to all be pointing at the same thing. But what is that? This explores that imagery & more, and was very entertaining & informative. It brought up possibilities that I had never heard before. It's so nice when you get fresh takes on a subject you know a lot about!"
3,A Peanut is Neither a Pea Nor a Nut,"Actually, it is a nut...If Atom were dead he'd be rolling in his grave after this CD was released. It makes me want to eat peanut butter."
3,Good but not worth it!,"The concept of having a test on an interactive CD is a great one since most people have computers these days. However, since CD's are cheap to make, charging 50+ dollars for this is not worth it. There are only 30 or so questions and the first time I took the test I got all but 2 right. That took less than 3 minutes! For 50 bucks you could buy several books on the subject. I do admit however, that the disk was very ""to the point"" so it does eliminate all of the ""page turning"" for books."
2,basically questions in the computer format,"I am not impressed at all. I thought there would be more educational tools in the CD than a book.If you just wants questions in the computer format, this is for you. but if you expect more than that, don't buy it."
2,Not for sleeping,"These aren't bad for blocking noise, however when the cord moves, or rubs against anything, it makes a loud scraping noise that is channeled directly into the ear. This sound is louder that what I am usually trying to block out."
4,Awesome Earplugs!,This is probably the best bang for your buck. They definitely block out most of the sound. You can also wear them for long periods of time once you get use to them. I personally think that you will get your money's worth.
3,"Good sound blocker, poor design of the strap","These plugs do a great job of insulating the excessive noise of power tools, lawnmower, etc. They are not comfortable for long duration. They could not be worn to bed as they stick out too much.I did not like how loosely the strap fits into the plugs. They actually arrive with the strap disconnected from the plugs. The strap has hardened endings (like shoe laces) that one is expected to insert into the ear plugs."
3,decent earplugs if you're already in a semi-quiet place,"These earplugs are pretty good if you're looking for something to block out minor distractions such as a tv show or a conversation going on in the next room. When it comes to blocking out noise from ppl. talking next to you on a bus or in a cafe, however, they don't do such a great job. another problem i had with these earplugs is that they are a bit too big for my ears; i'm petite, so when i insert them into my ear they are too snug and get quite uncomfortable after a while. also they make my ears itch too much. If you're looking for good earplugs, i'd recommend mack's safesound original soft foam earplugs, which block sound much better, fit your ear canal no matter how big/small it is (they are moldable), and don't make your ears so itchy. i've seen them at duane reade, cvs, and walgreens, so they're easy to come by."
1,If I could rate these zero...,"....I would. Although they are inexpensive, if it wasn't such a problem, I'd ask for my money back.What a piece of garbage. I purchased these for a Formula 1 race. There is no protection with these. Do not waste money. Look for something else, as we had to no ear protection with these and ended up with our fingers in our ears."
3,Airlock - Drystar,"Airlock's debut album _Drystar_ come on the heels of the whole downtempo craze, and it's pleasant, if not particularly memorable, trip-hop. The orchestral sweep of ""Drama 73"" or the swooning ""Slipinside"" bode well, even if the scratching at the start of ""DJ Risk vs. Airlock"" or the emotive textures of ""Alpha"" seem by-the-numbers. The title track is grittier and instrumental, which adds a nice contrast to the smoothness elsewhere. ""In the Mouth of the Fish"" also has a appealing folksy quality to it, and ""Awakening"" comes on like a bed of rose petals. ""Dramatic"" combines a deep bass with a gravelly beat and a light guitar line -- nothing groundbreaking, but enjoyable. Sort of like the album as a whole."
5,'' HARDCORE AT IT'S VERY BEST '' !,"THIS IS THE CD MOST HARDCORE FANS DREAM ABOUT! I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF THESE GUYS SINCE DAY ONE, AND ALL THEIR CDS ARE GREAT!THEY HAVE BRUTALITY IN THEIR MUSIC, AND ANGER IN THE VOCALS THAT DEFINE HARDCORE PERFECTLY..EVERY SONG IS GOOD , AND THE SONG THAT FEATURES A HORN SECTION IS A NICE TOUCH AS WELL.THEIR GUITAR RIFFS AT TIMES REMIND ME OF ''EXODUS '' ''THE CROMAGS ''AND '' BIOHAZARD '' AS WELL..AND BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE TRACK '' DOOMSAYER '' THAT FEATURES CHORDS REMINISCENT TO '' SLAYER'S '' STYLE OF PLAYING.SO IF YOU WANT A COOL CD TO CHECK OUT , THAN PICK UP THIS BAD BOY!YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID ,AND WILL GET HOOKED ON THESE GUYS FOR SURE!! GET ALL THEIR OTHER CDS AS WELL.THEY ARE THAT GOOD!!KEEP HARDCORE ALIVE!!"
3,ok,"hard book to understand and not written too clearly, however if your teacher required it, ure ganna have to sruggle"
5,A FRAGRANT PLEASURE,"Many like to ""layer"" their favorite fragrance, that is use a bath or shower gel followed by a body lotion then a spritz of perfume all in the fragrance of your choice. This is not only a pleasurable experience that makes you feel a bit pampered but it also tends to make your scent more lasting.This Body Lotion has the same delightful fragrance found in 'Still"" perfume. It's an intriguing blend of sweet florals (Freesia, Rose, Jasmine, Orange Blossom) spiced with White Pepper and Mandarin.One caveat: If your skin is extremely dry I'd suggest you opt for a richer moisturizing lotion, perhaps a cream.Treat yourself!"
4,"Lots of unsubstantiated, but nonetheless true, assertions","If more of Paul's assertions were substantiated by research (only about half are), I would give this book five stars. Even as it is, her assertions ring so true to me that not having footnotes corroborating her points is utterly forgiveable. Both her descriptions of society at large and her theories of individual reasoning behind decisions are recognizable to me and apply to my own life experiences and decisionmaking processes.This book is excellent for both young divorcees, to help understand what happened and where to go from here, and for not-yet-marrieds, like me, who are wondering how to make the first marriage be the lifelong and the last one. It's a quick read, and I really didn't expect it to ring as true as it does, on so many levels. Highly recommended."
2,Vague and Depressing,"I was surprised by how vague Paul's points seem to be. I understand that the issue of matrimony is a complicated one, but Paul offers few specific points as to why young marriages fail and is inconclusive about what to do about the problem. She points out over and over again that her examples of starter marriages encompass all races, creeds, socioeconomic and educational backgrounds--as well as all ages up to 30. The message I took from this was that no one is safe and no union can last. I thought it was a one-sided investigation and pessimistic observation without enough proof to make me buy into the message."
2,Get married only if you know he/she is the one,I really did not like this book it just simply talks about being married and it just fails there is no way to work it out just divorce and say Yeah I got divorced so I lied to the Preacher. The author got married at 27 and divorced at 28 and now thinks everybody who is in there 20's is going to make that same mistake. When are people going to learn getting married is not a game it is a serious commitment in life probably the most important thing you'll ever do. In today's times people who have no buisness being together are getting married and get out in 12 months because they are bored and simply do not understand what marriage is all about that is the number one problem in this country today.
2,disappointed reader,"I was disappointed with the book. It read like a long magazine piece, something belonging in a woman's magazine. It didn't seem like the writer really interviewed 60 couples - she only mentions about 10 people throughout the book that she actually interviewed. She quotes twentysomething men and women that were quoted by other writers in other articles and books. A lot of her points are actually the points of other writers on this issue, and then she just footnotes the source of the idea or quote. Also, I felt like she was biased - just b/c she married at 27 and divorced at 28 she thinks ""young"" marriages are doomed, and she doesn't give us any examples of successful marriages among twentysomethings, or constructive suggestions as to how to make a marriage work. Parts of the book were interesting, but I wanted fuller portraits of the people she interviewed, and deeper analysis, because this book just seemed like one long magazine piece."
5,COLLEGE BASKETBALL AT IT'S BEST !,"Every college basketball fan should see this video! Regardless of whether or not you are a UCLA fan, this video covers what may have been the ""Wonder age"" of the college game. In addition it of course highlights the magnificant career and teaching abilities of John Wooden."
1,UCLA Politics not Basketball,This DVD was very disappointing. Only 10% was devoted to basketball. Far too much worthless coverage of 1960s Vietnam era dissent. Very little basketball and the dynasty. Stay away from this DVD unless you want to watch lots of mind numbing human interest stories.
5,Lion Brand Yarn Crochet Hooks,"I love the Lions Brand crochet hooks as the yarn glides over the hooks when you crochet. In the past two years, I have tried to find these hooks on my travels to California as that is where I used to buy them. Well the Lions Brand hooks have disappeared form retail stores.So of course I was delighted to find them on Amazon and the price was so reasonable. I even bought the set of 3 larger hooks as I know I will need them one day.If you use the other brands of crochet hooks, you should try Lions Brand as they really glide so easily with the yarn and make crocheting go so much faster.My mother crocheted for YEARS and even had hooks form Japan and England, I have tried these and always return to my trusty Lions Brand hooks. Remember the price on Amazon with free shipping (meet qualifications) is the BEST!!"
3,Average hooks,"I bought these hooks on the advice of two favorable reviews. I can't see the reason they were rated so highly. There is nothing really wrong with them, but I don't think that they are worth the price."
4,"Great techniques, beautiful pictures","Borrowed this book from a friend and had to buy my own! Many wonderful beading techniques and ideas. Beautiful for tassel making, but also many stitches which can be applied to other types of beadwork. Great fringe ideas, lots of different elements. Well laid out with lots of pictures for inspiration."
4,Beaded Tassels,"Want to dress up drapery tiebacks with tassels or hang your beads from the ceiling fan switch? Valerie's book gives you lots of ideas to serve as a springboard.Not only does she give good instructions for traditional bead weaving, including brick, peyote, and netting stitches, to make your tassels, but also she shows how to make braids and cords. She suggests the combination of beads and cords in projects, including buried or berried bugle cords, crazy and flower chains, and branched fringe.If you don't want to make tassels, but need ideas for fringes on medicine bag necklaces and amulet purses, this is the book for you."
2,Not so good,"I was deeply disappointed in this product. The copy was old, grayish in color and the audio, just fair. I do not recommend this product."
2,Disappointing,"I didn't go into this demanding much - just a series of intriguing fictional biographies that interconnected with each other over the course of the novel. And to be fair, most of the biographies are well-written, and many are interesting. A few are even touching. But there are two major flaws that kept me from really enjoying this book:1) To really appreciate this as a whole, you need to be familiar with all of the characters' source films. This is especially noticeable with some of the less famous films.2) A significant number of the characters have unpleasant histories, with elements that only seemed to be added for shock value. This reaches its offensive peak with the last few bios, including that of the narrator.If those two issues aren't likely to be a problem for you, then you might get something out of this. Otherwise, I'd probably pass."
4,So-so Italo-Bosso,"Balanco is no Nicola Conte, but they've got a decent vibe. The tunes are all mid-tempo (some double-timed to good effect) and I think I've caught my neighbors listening in when it's been on. Vinyl lovers beware that the record only has six tracks: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10 which is a real disappointment. I thought about pegging them a star for that, but then the first song, a Morricone remake, got stuck in my head. Call it 3.5 stars rounded up."
2,SOUTHERN ROCK?,"YOU WOULD THINK A CD CALLED SOUTHEAN ROCK CHRISTMAS WOULD BE SOUTHERN BANDS. I GUESS FOGHAT MIGHT BE FROM SOUTH ENGLAND, AND CANNED HEAT COULD BE FROM THE SOUTHERN WEST COAST. YOU THINK WHO EVER PUT THIS CD TOGETHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A LITTLE MORE MUSIC INFORMATION."
4,Amazing shovel but it doesn't do the work for you,I'm glad I got this even though it's fairly expensive. It does help cut through roots and clay soil and it's definitely easier than using a normal shovel. It's well made and the shovel head itself is very heavy duty. Clay has a tendency to stick to the shovel so you do have to knock the clay off regularly in order to maintain the cutting edges.
4,good but not great,"This is a Salsoul product so if you know that label, you know what you are going to get here. (btw, if you are new to Salsoul, this is probably not the disc you should start with)You get some Philly soul styled tracks here. The Salsoul Orchestra (which is either the same as MFSB or overlaps quite a bit with MFSB) is definitely ubiquitous on this disc. The songs tend to be album versions rather than extended 12"" versions. This is fine by me as I have 12"" versions of a lot of the Salsoul catalog. The sound quality seems a bit off compared to other Salsoul discs I own. Do note that though the strings and Philly soul style production shows up on nearly every track, only half to 60% of the songs are really true dance tracks. There are some other nice tracks, but they aren't really philly soul/disco hybrid tracks but more philly soul style ballads and slow groovers."
1,Not Orginal Artists,I thought K-Tel used original recordings but this is not the original recording. Maybe that doesn't bother some people but as far as I'm concerned it goes straight into the trash.
4,This is a page turner for anyone who likes strong women.,"Since I had never read a romance novel, I decided to try this one. Although it's an easy read, it kept my attention and I really liked the characters!"
4,Good Stand,"I purchased this stand for my new acoustic guitar and am very pleased, so far. It is plain looking, but has adjustable supports to accommodate various guitar shapes and, therefore, is quite functional. My guitar is custom-made and has an unusual shape (Renaissance Guitar). This stand supports it very nicely with no wobble and folds up very nicely for easy transport. It is an attractive addition to the guitar and seems solidly built. My only ""complaint"" is that the rosewood option was not available. But I couldn't find it anywhere else, either. My general feeling is that this stand is well worth the price."
5,Back to Basics,"Clara E. Garcia gets back to basics in her New book Peace of Mind. Her question to everyone who reads her book,""Would you like to have Peace of Mind""? In her book she focuses on those things in this world that bring us down (fear, worry, anxiety, materialistic things) that take us away from God's grace and then shares with us how we can get back on the right track to redemption. She makes this book very easy to read so that anyone at any age can read and understand the message. Highly recommended."
5,"""HAVEN"" I Love It!","I truly enjoyed watching the episode on my laptop. It is a great T.V Show - Science Fiction, and maybe Fantasy - but I tell it's a terrific series to watch."
5,Wow! A Magnificent TV Series!,I am so happy with these new TV series based on supernatural events and story plots. This one is a winner. Every episodes keeps you at the edge of your seat! Special effects are awesome. Kudos!!!
5,Top Notch!,"Packaging was clean and crisp, obviously new. Discs were immaculate, no scuffs/scratches/smudges. Story is compelling, actors are great. Very pleased =D"
5,love this show,"loe this show, fun interesting, a little like a supernatural northern exposure, quirky things and people would recomend to anyone, watched it thru streaming on my tv, it was great looking no pauses or hiccups . i Plan to watch more movies"
5,Can't wait for season 3,When will Season 3 start ? I look forward to the next episode every week. What will happen next in Haven. I would move there.
5,Great Series,I have season one as well and totally enjoy both seasons. I especially enjoy no commercials and able to watch this at my leisure. Not happy with the way season three is going so not sure I will be purchasing that when that is available. Recommend watching the series before buying to see if this type if show appeals to you.
4,Piqued Interest,"I thoroughly enjoyed this season and it definitely left me wanting more! The character development is coming along the mysteries deepen and I just want to keep watching. If season three is as good as season two than you can be sure I will be buying! Gifts or curses for those afflicted, we shall see.....OOOOOOOO AWWAWWWW! (evil maniacal laughter)"
5,Good show. Getting better each season.,"This show started out strong, started to waiver (almost like the writers got bored with it), then took off again. Nice plot hooks (and the best music of ANY show out there), good acting and there should be (I hope) enough material to mine for at least a few more seasons. 8 out of 10 (hey, when you have to compete with Breaking Bad there's only so many 9's out there) - you'll like it."
2,disappointing series,"I gave season 1 the benefit of the doubt because it had to establish the back story, but season 2 seems to be nothing but filler. It tries to keep you on the hook with their little mysteries but there never seems to be a payoff. We see pictures of Lucy in the past, so we might expect time travel to be involved but instead we get stupid stories about roots attacking or water breathing children.I have totally lost interest in this series.I say, save your money, this series isnt worth it."
5,I still remember this book,"I don't remember reading any other of Bill Wallace's books but I read this book for the first time when I was in the fourth grade in 1987. This book was so touching and profound that I remembered it 17 years later while book shopping for my son. This was the first book that I remember reading as a child that totally transported me with its words. I was there with Ricky when his fear slowly turned to friendship and his acceptance of loss. I remember crying while reading the last two chapters but I don't think the book would have been as moving and memorable with any other ending. I remember being the most upset after reading the last line because I wanted to read more of Ricky's story. This book is the reason I am such an avid reader today. Bill Wallace took me to another place and let me experience fear, friendship, suspense, loss and acceptance. It is a definite must read for the 4th to 6th grade group."
5,I read this book at the begining of 8th grade!,I read this book at the begining of 8th grade and I loved it! I still love how it makes you feel like a little child again. The book was written very well and I would recomend it to anyone who loves pets and has warm hearts (which i bet all of you have ;) ) Im in 9th grade now and at times i still read the book. The book is about a boy who is scared of dogs from a past experience. When he finds a stray pup who is almost starving to death he wont feed it because he is so afraid of dogs. However if the dog doesnt get food soon he will die. he boy overcomming his fear of dogs is only the beginning of the heart felt friendship.And soon they will be tested. Read the book to find out what happens!
5,A Dog Called Kitty,"This book is about a boy who's afraid of dogs. A stray puppy comes around looking for food. The Mother of the family always puts out scraps of food for the cats and calls ""Here Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!"" The Puppy comes too, but the cats attack him. He is about to starve when Ricky decides to feed him. In the process of giving him the food, Ricky overcomes his fear of dogs. The dog is called Kitty because he comes running for the food every time Ricky's mom calls Kitty! They become friends. I think the writer has a unique writing style. He writes in the first person. It is so vividly written that you feel like you're standing there listening to the story of his childhood. The book had a great storyline and was vividly described. The book had a funny theme. I'd give this book 6 stars if I could"
2,Young Dog Lovers Beware,"Although a very well written book, I would not have allowed my young daughter to read this if I had know the outcome of the story. Young dog lovers beware, that ""Kitty"" DIES unexpectedly, and tragically toward the end of the story. My daughter loves dogs and cats, and was so distraught by Kitty's death, that she didn't care that the boy finds another dog to begin a friendship with. In fact, I don't know that she even read the last several pages of the book right away, because she was so upset. She is okay with it now, and still likes the book, but as a parent, I wish I would have seen the book summary on this site prior to letting her read it."
4,A Review Of A Dog Called Kitty,"In the beginning of A Dog Called Kitty a kid named Ricky is afraid of dogs because when he was a baby he had a bad experience with a dog. In the middle of the book Ricky finds a dog in the barn.The dog chases Ricky all around the barn.After awhile Ricky gets used to the dog and names him Kitty. In the end of the book Ricky and Kitty fight wolves and beat them but get really hurt too.As soon as they get home Ricky's mom calls the vet and the doctor.Kitty gets a big patch on his stomach.A few days later when Ricky and Kitty go for a walk,something terrible happens to Kitty.To find out what happens to Kitty read A Dog Called Kitty."
2,Parents beware,It is a lovely book. However the dog meets a tragic end. It is not for young or sensitive children.
4,A nice game but a little slow,"I got this for my 11 year old son for Christmas. He likes it and says it is fun but that it doesn't teach you anything or stretch your mind. It is kind of slow paced and therefore not super exciting but still fun. We have only played it once or twice compared to the many times we have played the other games we got for Christmas, I guess we lean towards more strategic games around here. That being said I am still glad we got it becuase we love the Narnia books and this gives the kids one more way to interact with the stories."
5,This album and all of his album is great!,All of his albums will blow your mind and meaning it will amaze you how great his music is. And they all sound good. And the beats too. I am here to remind you Stevie B that you will always ahe my support forever. And I love all of your music. And you are talented! All fo his albums are worth buying everyone thanks because his music all sounds good!
4,Great! . Contains so good Gaitas.,"Guaco always demonstrate being a Great group. So, you have never heard something like that. Just buy it."
5,yarrrrrrrrrrrrrr,Yarrrrr is a victory cry in the land of puzzle pirates. I would say they have scored a victory with this game. It can be played online as well as off line. Online play is monitored very closely to keep the site family friendly and appropriate for children over 13. I give this game 5 stars.
4,Dated but Valuable,"I was already playing Puzzle Pirates when I purchased this boxed set; I bought it primarily because I wanted the ""Backsword"", an object for use in the on line game that has the advantage of never wearing out. I got what I paid for, and a bit more.The CD contains an out of date Puzzle Pirates client that is still useful in that it provides off line access to four of the games puzzles for those inevitable times when the internet is not available. The CD key also gives you a month of time on the on line game (currently worth more than the price of this box) and your choice of either of two imperishable game objects: the aforementioned Backsword (not a great sword, but tolerable), or the Savvy Hat.IF you play Puzzle Pirates, this package is extremely worthwhile at the current price.PDH"
4,Excellent,Stephen Wolinsky's workHearts on Fireis excellent .Anyone interested in Non Duality would do well to study it.
3,"Good protection, or so I thought..","I an satisfied overall with this product. It keeps my phone protected from my clumsines. However I am very unhappy how I go to all this trouble to protect my phone, but the stitching has left little mini nicks on the silver portion at the top of the phone. I payed good money for the phone and the case and it got nicked because I was trying to protect my phone. Also, the handy dandy clip has loosened already.. I already have placed an order from the Motorola website for a leather phone case, hopefully this one has more thought placed into it's construction"
3,Good Case - Flimsy Belt Clip,"The belt clip literally fell apart within 2 weeks of use. I was able to put it back together, but now the phone won't lock in properly and I'm afraid of using the clip for fear of losing my phone.The locking system is pretty standard though. I'm carrying the phone in my coat pocket until I have time to dig around the house for the clip from my old phone. Or I can pick one up for a few bucks at Radio Shack.I like the case itself. It looks good, has decent ergonomics, and protects your phone. But when looking at the price, add on a few dollars for a replacement belt clip."
2,Body Glove Cellsuit - poor design,"The case is fine, but the belt clip is terrible! When pressing the clip to put it on (or take it off) your belt, its extremely hard to open more than a tiny bit. Their old style had a metal spring design that worked well. This new design is only a piece of plastic that must be flexed. I went to the Verizon store and found a one that worked perfect for less money."
5,Like a child's security blanket,"I've been using Thermaphore (sp)heating units for over 30 years. The only problem I've ever found is that the switches wear out, but as soon as it does, I order another one. Once I sent it back to the factory and they shipped me a new one. I go to sleep every night with the switch in my hand, raising and lowering the temp until I fall asleep. I can hardly stand to go away from home if I forget it. Makes it terribly hard to get to sleep. Guess you could say I'm addicted to this medical aid. I am currently having serious back/spine problems and the Thermaphore is the best medicine. It's a marvelous product."
5,The very best!,"After using many many heating pads over the years, in which the plastic ""smooshed"" and cracked & with covers that fell off and were not soft I found the Thermaphore heating pad which is absolutely wonderful! The heating pad itself is not made with plastic on the outside, but a canvas like cloth which is very durable and conforms to your body! The outside cover is a very soft, thick fabric! What a difference it makes to have something soft and cozy next to your skin... I love having the control of the on/ off hand held switch. My back and shoulders feel much better after a 20 minute treatment. I purchased two more for my parents! They have his and her's heating pads. I think the hand held switch is a great idea for anyone who might fall asleep when using a heating pad."
2,Not moist as described,This item was given as a gift and I have been told that it does not take much if any moisture from the air and does not live up to its moist heat advertising.
2,thermophore moist heat pack,One of the drawbacks was that it is to large to be used in the seated position.Instructions state not to bend the product so it can only be used while laying down.Also the manual switch is very inconvienient.After releasing the switch the heat goes away fast and you must then repeat the holding of the manual switch. Not worth it for the cost and time involved.
4,It covers a lot of pain,I have a long torso and the pad fits perfectly. Delivery date was as promised.I use this product for a recent surgery and for foot neuropathy. I would use this company for further business.
5,Excellent product!,This is an excellent buy. The heating pad works well.I would definitely recommend this heating pad.
4,Better than before,My wife replaced a much older Thermophore Moist Heating Pad with this new version and she likes it better than the older one that wore out after more than 20 years - it is larger than the older version and the pad and cover are more substantion - this is our second one in over 20 years and we are very pleased with it. The seller did everything in a speedy way.
5,Great Therapy Heating Pad,This heating pad has been so helpful in loosing up tight back muscles prior to playing golf. There have also been very cold nights when my calf muscles have cramped and I use this moist heating pad to relax the cramps for a good nights sleep. I highly recommend the thermophore moist heating pad for any aching muscles.
2,Sooo disappointed. Not automatic at all. Have to hold down button for heat!,"I am so disappointed in this product. It sells itself as automatic, but it is NOT. You have to manually hold down the button to get it to produce heat. Who wants to have to hold down a button to get it to work? There were versions sold as manual that described this. I purposely looked for one that was automatic to avoid having to hold down a button non-stop to get it to work. This product was sold as an automatic version (even the box says automatic). Having to hold down a button non-stop to get it to work doesn't qualify as automatic in my opinon. I feel like I have been misled. I am very disappointed. I can only imagine use of this item on a regular basis would be very uncomfortable, defeating the point of trying to releave tension. Do not purchase this if you are truly looking for a hands-free item (beyond initially turning it on)."
5,Thermophore Moist Heating Pad,"If you want relief, If you want quick heat, this is the heating pad that will do it all.I did buy the large 14 x 27 with the dead man control. Good thing! don't fall asleep with this pad on. Talk about a sunburn.With this type of control, safety is no problem."
5,Great product. Replacement.,"Great product. We had ""inherited"" one from my Mother which lasted 25 years. We then began to have trouble getting it to come on so we decided it was time to replace it. The product was exactly the same as our old one and works just as great. Hope it lasts as long!!!! Supplier was prompt in shipping and we are pleased with the entire purchase."
5,thermophore pad is wonderful,"Comparing this pad to an ordinary drugstore pad is like comparing a rowboat to a battleship. I became aware of this product by visiting a friend who said to me ""you are walking as if you are really in pain"". I acknowledged that I was and he said ""try this"". Within 15 minutes I was searching for one for me on my phone internet browser while I was still using has pad...if you like a deep heat on your sore shoulders, don't even hesitate.You will notice that the information says it has a ""trigger"" switch you have to hold down to have the unit on. Trust me, within 3 minutes you will understand and appreciate that switch.Simply, it's more money, but it is worth it."
5,neck heating pad,"I have one of each size of the thermaphore. They are wonderful with the moist heat that they put out. The neck size arthritic one is a little different from the others I have. This one has a timed on/off switch, and because of that, the heat is not as intense. That being said, the heat is still more moist and intense than other heating pads. This one also, being as narror as it is, allows you to wrap it around and elbow, neck or knee."
5,Nice heat,I liked the size and the temperature of this heating pad. The moist heat is very penetrating and relieving for aching joints.
1,thermophore heating pad,"This product does not work as it is suppose to do nothing was done about it!Thermophore Back/Arthritis Heating Pad, Large, Standard 14"" x 27"" (Auto-Switch)I've a petite one."
5,excellent investment,"I purchased this heating pad because I have a job where I'm on my feet for 8+ hours a day, this has truly been a god send. One of those items that is very expensive however, glad you invested. Amazon was also half the price of the stores in my area."
5,Worth every penny,"This is a great product if you have back pain or muscle pain anywhere. I've been struggling with back pain lately and have been using this every night before I go to bed and it helps a lot. It gets very hot, so I'm glad they designed it with a switch that doesn't stay on until you're holding it down. Very satisfied."
3,Heating pad delivers pain relief.,I got this heating pad on the recommendation from an older friend. I didn't believe that the moist heat would really be any different from any other type of heating pad. Wow was I wrong. This pad delivers such extreme targeted heat that my lower back pain disappears within minutes of applying.The only feature I would add to the pad is that I would have it cycle on and off automatically rather than having to manually hold the switch.
3,Louder Please,The sound quality on this 1963 Live recording in not quite up to par even for the era. Maybe they toned it down a bit thinking people wouldn't like Jimmy Heath's percieved harshness of tone on the tenor sax. In any event Jimmy lays out on a couple of ballad features for Milt and the rhythm section led by Hank Jones
4,Delillo's Fourth Best Novel,"A fun read, vintage Delillo, loaded with what we've come to expect from an American literary master.A must read for any Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorist.Behind (in order) Underworld, Mao II, and White Noise, Libra is Delillo's fourth best novel."
4,A BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN CLASSIC,"From the poetic opening to the climatic ending, Don Delillo doesn't fail to deliver what is promised; a dark piece of history on paper.Character's are expertly crafted and there is rarely the sentence lacking in ingenius observances and irony. Dialogue is extremely provocative and difficult events are pictured with masterful eloquence. The plot itself is very well-crafted if not neccessarily executed to the fullest. The ever-present cynicism is also very welcome and blesses the novel with a unique feel.If there is a flaw with the book, it must be said that there is a lack of consistent progression. You ca devour a hundred or more pages without having a sense of a developing plot. This factor is why I haven't recommended this book any higher. I still believe White Noise is has yet to be toppled over its lofty perch.However, despite this shortcoming, this book is testimony to Delillo's position in comtemporary literature: a master for lesser's to see."
3,Libra,"Libra (Contemporary American Fiction)by Don DeLilloThe book was recommended by a writer friend of mine who liked ""Libra"" very much. I usually do not read this genre, but wanted to give it a try. I didn't enjoy the read that much. Found the characters not engaging enough, the novel a bit disjointed."
1,What a waste -- I just don't get it,"OK, after many years of reading reviews touting DeLillo as one of the greats of modern American literature, I decided to read ""Libra."" If this qualifies as great literature, America's literary future is in serious peril. His characters are cardboard cutouts. His dialog is stilted and unrealistic. His descriptive passages are underdone with little evidence of imagination or enthusiasm.Overall, this was a boring book that I would not recommend to anyone. Desperate to understand DeLillo's appeal, I forced myself to read all the way to the end...then wondered why.I've been an avid reader for almost 50 years, reading books and short stories from every genre. I'm always willing to give an author the benefit of the doubt.Maybe I'm just older than most of DeLillo's followers. Maybe it's just that I was old enough in 1963 to understand what was going on. Maybe I'm just expecting too much from DeLillo.This was my first DeLillo novel. It will also be my last."
4,Libra Review,"Don DeLillo's use of figuritive language and his use of varying sentence patterns made the reading very interesting. This one was deffinately a page turner. DeLillo takes one of the most popular assasinations of world history and tells it from a different point of view. The reader gets to look at the whole incident from the perspective of Oswald. While at some parts I still did not know what was going on in the book and found it very confusing, i loved it, just for that. It was not some easy reading, predictable book. It made you think and thats what I loved about it most. I would recommend it to anybody!"
3,libra,"While the characters at plot in Libra are very intricate and well developed, the novel has one thing working against it: We all know the end. But if you like Delillo's writing style or are interested in Oswald's life (the most interesting parts of the book) then it is worth reading. Not up to White Noise, but still pretty good."
5,Spellbinding,"This is one of the most riveting and memorable novels I have ever read. DeLillo is a writer of power, and he has chosen one of the defining events of the century to work his magic. Blending fact with fiction where gaps exist, DeLillo provides a breathtaking and totally plausible interpretation of the forces and people that came together in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It's trip back in time to the days when Fidel Castro, the Soviet Union, the CIA, and the Mafia monopolized the American and world stage, made all the more bizarre because the reader often doesn't know whether he is reading fact or supposition. One thing is sure: The reader will never think of the JFK era in the same way again."
5,Don DeLillo perfect!,Fantastic fictional deliberation and elaboration of the characters and conspiracies culminating in the assassination of JFK. DeLillo pounds out amazing characters and builds nail-biting suspense in his fictionalized account of Oswald's participation in the assassination. Even with profuse editing errors--mostly involving punctuation--this manuscript deserves the highest rating and regard.
4,Compelling Read,Fascinating look at how the JFK assasination COULD have happened. Excellent blend of fictitious character and real life ones. You get an idea of what some notorious figures like Guy Bannister and David Ferrie must have been like. DeLillo injects you into the mind and world of Lee Harvey Oswald. And what you find is a man who is not easy to like but complelling to watch. Oswald is a moth fluttering around all his life until the light which is Dealey Plaza draws him in to his ulitmate destiny. The book also is gives a look at how a man might truly be in two places at once.
3,"Beautiful pieces, but fragmented as a whole","Each chapter of Libra could make a great ""Atlantic"" article. Written with nuance and a keen eye for the perfect little details, they are individually stunning. What DeLillo fails to do, however, is integrate the pieces in a compelling way. Besides some promising scenes that the reader will identify (for example, the notorious photo of Lee H. posing with a gun in his backyard) and recurring and painfully obvious expositions on the place of coincidence in history, this feels like a loosely related short story collection. Yet I suppose that the greatest failing of Libra is to make the reader feel any pang of sadness or sympathy when its characters so famously die. DeLillo's sober, detatched style backfires in this sense. The pieces of something great are here, but DeLillo doesn't bring them together."
4,The Onion Effect,"Great read. However, I get the feeling that there are a few (many?) nuances that I didn't catch. Definite ""re-read"" material. Read a review putting G. Gordon Liddy as Mackey?? Guess I should also ""re-read"" Woodward and Bernstein."
5,I Love These Boots!,I purchased these boots in the middle of January thinking I could use them this winter because I live in Colorado and often visit the mountains. When I received them I was disappointed because they were too small but I thought I would try them anyways. After about two days they started to stretch out and now I am in love with them!
3,It could have been better,"As a faithful ""vulcan"" fan, I was initially excited about this novel. But I was disappointed in the story after reading it. The plot had potential and really was the redeemable factor of this book, but it was too predictable. I found the characters generally shallow and there were incongruencies between this story and some other Star Trek novels that have been written."
3,Eh. It's Okay.,"First things first, what does the cover have to do with what's inside the book? Nothing that I could tell.On to the meat of the experience. This is a Star Trek who-dunnit? Anyone's who's paying attention can figure out who the guilty party is even with a convenient Red Herring to distract you. Something keeps being thumped into the reader's head time and time again 'murder isn't a Vulcan concept' Ooooh.I did enjoy the various exploration that Lorrah did of the Vulcan culture, it was very beleivable, and the best part of the book. The murder mystery was sort of surperflous to me, and rather boring. I think Kirk would have been a more careful detective should the need have ever arisen on the show, instead he lets his guard down all the time and pays the price for it.An enjoyable book, but not the best Star Trek book I have ever read. I think the best part of this was the Spock/Sarek interaction."
5,Hot Hot,It is great in all ways!!!! More than I expected and hotter. A wok is great on this stove. Would buy again
2,Avoid this if you need precise flame control,When I turn down the flame to low it immediately creeps back up some. Precise flame control is impossible with this spongy feeling valve. Sorry I bought this piece of junk and went back to using my old cooker. This one would be ok for brewing beer or other hot flame cooking but useless if you need a controlled lower flame at times.UPDATE: I have had this cooker for a good while now and am editing my review and upping my stars to two from one. I am still dissatisfied with the poor valve and imprecise flame control but must admit I really like the power of this unit and have learned to adjust the heat on my wok by moving it off the flame from time to time rather than turning it way down when I season my oil or finish a sauce. If you don't need good control over the heat it is pretty good cooker.
5,Powerful outdoor burner for cook food restruant way,"Ever wonder why the resturant food tasted better than home cooked? This burner solved that mystery. Most home stoves are boiling the food, not really fry them. This burner put out so much heat, it evaporates the water in the juice, so the juice from food can stay with the food. Flavor is much better in the food cooked on this burner.Ever since we have this burner, we don't go out to the restruant that much any more. You can really taste the differences from home cooking!Amazon is so good offer free shipping of this item!"
2,warranty problem,"I purchased a 6voit optima Red Top battery in Nov. 2011 for my 1947 New Yorker. The battery lost it charge in May 2012.You cannot return batteries to amazon,so I called Optima about warranty and was told that amazon was not an authorized dealer.Optima even said they did not know where amazon got the batteries from.Now I am in the process of replacing this at my expense. Ask before you buy."
1,quality has declined sharply,I have used Optima batteries in several vehicles since the early nineties and have been satisfied until the last three years. I have had consistent failures with two sets of yellow tops in my duel battery equipped pick up trucks. They died after very light use and would not accept any form of re charging.I will not buy Optimas again.
5,battery heaven,"The Optima batteries were everything I expected and so much more. The battery life is exceptional and charge time is minimal. The packaging protected the batteries allowing zero shipping damage. I use two D31M batteries with a Digital Motorguide 82lb thrust trolling motor on an aluminum 17ft boat with an Evinrude 40hp motor. Not light weight. I fish mostly trolling motor only lakes and the batteries have not so far, given any power loss noticeable to me even after 10 hours of fishing. I am very satisfied. I have used these batteries for a minimum of 18 fishing trips.I am very pleased."
3,Im not seeing the old optima batteries they use to make.,The last optima I had was 800 cold cranking amps maybe more but any way it was a dry cell that they produced for industrial big rigs.And it had a lifetime warranty.The battery lasted me threw 2 vehicles with heavy electrical use back when I was into the car audio fase.
2,Not worth the extra $,"I tried an Optima Red Top with high hopes of getting at least 5-6 years out of it.Well, try 3 1/2 years and no pro-rated warranty.No extra battery load, just standard equipment.Was maintained with a trickle charge as they recommend on their web site.The batteries good looks are misleading as the overall performance was surprisinglya disappointment.Perhaps the technologies will improve in the future, but for now,you don't get what you pay for with Optima.. :("
3,Different quality,"Although both batteries were ordered at the same time in the same way, one performs good to excellent and the other one performs below specification (one batterie is older and was discharged when received). Only with a sophisticated computer-controlled recharging I was able to equalize the status of both batteries purchased at new. Your supplier/the batterie manufacturer should test and float batteries before shipping. Manufacturer did not supply any specification."
3,Won't buy this product again,"Bottom line, I choose not to buy this product again.I tried to resolve my problem through both Amazon and the Vendor, and in both cases, got the finger from both. So I am on my own. Fine.In my case, the basic battery works OK, like I like it. I have four of them for my solar backup setup.But what failed was the little plastic case carrying some metal nuts which was perforated, and was missing one of the nuts. I checked the shipping box several times, too.So being an old Marine, I have already jury rigged it, and all is OK right now. I used some aluminum foil, and some extra wing nuts I got from Amazon.But for what I paid for it, I expected better. Hence I will shop elsewhere, and solve my little problem on my own."
5,I would highly recommend,"We added this AGM to our TT as a second battery, and I kick myself for not either (1) buying it sooner, or (2) buying two of them at the same time, I remember seeing about people having shipping problems, but mine was a-ok and is performing like a champ. Thank you Optima!"
5,Great for a boat!,I use four of these on a boat and can sit for hours and hours without having to worry about a dead battery. I do recommend using a battery tender if they are going to sit for extended periods of time without use.
2,Optima Batteries,"I have used optmas in my cars since the 90s.I have used them in my 87 Buick GN and multiple corvettes. They were the best. However the last copule of years something has changed. I use to let my vettes sit for weeks and they would start without a problem. Now they cant sit for more than two weeks without going dead. Once they are dead forget about charging them. 6 months ago I changed the optima n my 90 Callaway vette to an interstate and can go a month with out a charge. i also examined the electrical system the only draw is the clock and factory security light. Tonight the same problem in my GN. The car sat for three weeks (red top Battery is 3 months old) and the battery is dead and wont take a charge. I never had a problem with the yellow tops or red tops in the 90s, and now I have the same problems with both. I think something was changed in theses batteries and I am now done."
5,Great battery,"I really wonder if some reviewers here actually read Optima's FAQ.Optima clearly states that a deeply discharged battery may appear (even to ""techs"") as defective and explains how to charge such battery.Also, ANY lead acid battery is subject to sulfation if stored at low charge. Desulfating chargers work and don't cost that much."
1,Walmart battery out lasted it,"Bought this on 3-09 realized it was bad when I summarized my boat 4-11, one month after the Warranty was out, started to notice it was going out last summer but thought it was sulfated and bought a ctek charger to take care of it in the winter. I had bought a walmart battery at the same time with a perco switch just in case and the walmart is still able to start my boat but the optima will not even crank the motor over! Called to optima and they were thrilled that the battery was just out of warranty and did not even want to help!! I got about 7 months out of this battery. I would have considered even giving them a chance if they would have at least prorated a new one since the battery has not been in use since October of last year, im 31 and have a lot of battery's to buy in my lifetime but it will not be an optima!!"
2,Loved them until they needed a charge...,"I've bought nothing but Optima batteries for my boats since 2002 and used to love them. No servicing was required and they used to last more than five years, on average, vs. one or two years for conventional batteries. Lately, I've had very bad luck with my AC Battery Charger on my boat (replaced it in Oct 09 and again in Feb 10). Once these batteries were discharged they never came back up."
4,Short Warranty period,"Although this IS a great battery, it ONLY has an 18 month free replacement warranty with an additional 18 month ""pro-rated"" warranty period that drops off quite dramatically. (I.E. after 27 months I ONLY got $50 credit towards a new battery!!) For a battery with this kind of premium price, I would expect it to have a longer replacement warranty.Also I had a hard time finding a dealer to replace it. All (including optima customer service) told me to take it back to the selling dealer. I had to get the area rep involed. A lot of hassel!"
1,Poor Packing Still An Issue,"Well, I should have heeded the poor packing feedback left by others. These are great batteries but Amazon is not the place to buy them. Battery arrived with only one sheet of brown paper for ""padding"". Box was destroyed and battery top broken. Amazon promptly refunded my money but this issue needs to be corrected. Please don't waste your time or money on this item. Buy locally."
3,Nicely made,"The set is very nice and looks great. Very sturdy and well balanced.Just an FYI, though. The shovel is not deep and the handles are not long."
5,Read this!,"This novel by Dorothy Strachey, sister of famous biographer and eccentric, Lytton Strachey, is a little jewel of a well-written novel. Probably based on Dorothy's experiences in a girl's school, it describes a English teenager's crush on a school mistress in late 19th century France. This novel is not about sex or being a lesbian. It is about anticipation and the overwhelming need for affection and approval. It is a classic, ""coming of age"" novel with (for once!) a young girl instead of a young boy. Quick, enthralling read!"
1,IT SUCKED!!! YUCK!!!,i couldnt stand the discusting entrees this thing wanted me to cook! o yuck! i literally puked my food up when i ate what i had made. and boy did it stink! i couldnt sit for weeks after the diarrea!!!!!!!!
2,Is it really James Last?,Poor song selection and it doesn't sounds like James Last at all. And I don't like they don't specify it's live concert recording not studio recording. Poor quality.
4,Yoga blocks are great joint/ bone protecters.,"Besides using these for yoga, I've found that you can place these under your knees and do push-ups with them. It's great for those who are struggling to do push-ups in the beginning. It helps you achieve maximum reps in a set. When you get stronger, you can eventually do them without the yoga blocks, and use them for yoga. A real bone saver."
1,I did not like: not 4lb as advertised and smells like chemicals,"First, the blocks are *not* 4 lbs as advertised the in title. If you look at the specs you will see that the shipping weight is 1.8lbs for both (I should have looked at the specs first before ordering) When I received the blocks, the first thing I noticed was their lack of weight.Second, the blocks smell strongly of bad smelling chemicals (I am not the only reviewer to notice this, but apparently the only one offended by it). I took the shrinkwrap off of one and had to immediately place it outside because of the horrible odor.I will try to return these items - I will report back what happens with the return. Based on the seller's return policy, my gut feeling is that they won't refund the shipping and will charge me a 35% restocking fee since one of these items is opened, even though I believe they are defective (i.e. smell like chemicals) and not as advertised (i.e. not 4 lb). We'll see."
3,served its purpose,was helpful keeping balance and holding poses if you are new in yoga. was stable. dont buy it if you are flexible enough. no need.
5,Answer to above question,"I recently read an update on this family, I think it was from the last 90's. Josh had health problems and they had to institutionalize Noah. The older son,Karl,became a writer.I've only read the first book, it was incredible and moving. It's sad that there isn't a ""good"" resolution to this story but it's well written and should give peace to parents of handicapped children,there is no perfect answer,no perfect parenting, people can only do the best that they can.I'm also grateful to Josh Greenfeld for writing such an honest and moving book."
5,heartwrencing--author's style is the best--and so honest !,"Would really like to know how this family has survived, can't imagine what their lives were like! the author couldn't have revealed it better although many of us will never have been there. I see so much courage,faith, and love coming from those pages. Would like to know how Noah is doing now. Would like to contact Josh, he's a saint !"
3,A genre sleeper,"Seems this book needed to be published, this time around authored by one Robert Anderson, who obviously was dissatisfiedwith his predecessor's book. Mr. Anderson gives us a good indication that three sources can be written about a spy show that started and ended as a serious espionage thriller, and more than just a small-screen copy of 007. This is politically correct: the show was only a spoof for two annuals, including the spinoff starring a female lead--cocreator Sam Rolfe hated the campy approach and diehard followers would swear in agreement. The fact the show lost its magic touch were the lighter scripts that eventually bored even the leads. Dissatisfication with one's childhood isn't a required to despise a good half of the episodes along with its short-lived spinoff bomb. Some of the third year's episodes are definitely comparable with Michael Myers' Austin Powers. Buy Anderson's book if you like the show."
4,Great read,"Great book, the lead character jory has enough flaws to make you interested in how she fares. Also she isn't histrionic like Dr Grey Veil becomes in the latter books of the Stardoc series. Would love to see her story continue."
2,not a bad read,Not a terrible paperback. Story was alright though highly predictable. Would probably give it 2.5 stars if that were an option.
4,I haven't read it yet.,"It's probably good. All my friends recommended it, and they forced me to buy it."
5,"A lively, endearing, and rejuvenating biography .","Linda Finch has written a lively, endearing, and rejuvenating biography that will take you back to your own roots, Bronxite or not. Her non-chronological life list is both warm and peppery. Vibrant little memory flashes weave an indelible sense of her World War 11 childhood in the Bronx and resonate with our own. My Life As A List is wonderfully laid out with an amazing number of family photographs which somehow, inexplicably, reflect the wry poignancy that pervades this fascinating and unique little book."
1,an awful book,very awful. White guy can get any Asian guy anytime is the theme in his book. All I see is a stupid white guy in asian country looking for sex sex sex. then he demonstrates readers a list: which one he slept and where and when. very boring book and EGO-expanding book. Not recommend to read.
2,Reveals more than he realizes,"The danger of writing autobiography is that you can reveal a lot more than you realize. In this case, we find a vain, self-centered man with little self-awareness who merely recounts his travels in the world of rice. There's a good book to be written about this subject, but this isn't it."
2,Not much self analysis,"No one seems to really discuss race ,ethnicity, and inter-racial relationships openly in western gay society or mainstream media, (except when it comes to blaming African Americans for the passing of the anti gay marriage Prop 8 in Nov. 2008)That's why I was pleasantly surprised and intrigued by Daniel Gawthrop's memoir ""The Rice Queen Diaries"" what I thought would be an interesting look when homosexuality, race, and desire collidePart academic/anthropological study of gay asian men, part travelogue, part red shoe diaries, Gawthrop chronicles his life as the gay, white Wilt Chamberlain with ""yellow fever"", jumping from asian man to asian man, first in his native Vancouver Canada, then an extended 3 month vacation in Thailand and Vietnam, to eventually ""going native"" (his words) by living in Thailand for three years.I commend the authors frankness and honesty, and owning up to the ""Rice Queen"" label. He said Thailand and Vietnam changed him, but where is the proof?"
3,Fine for limited use,"I usually use a quality 1/4"" drive set, but I needed an inexpensive ratchet drive to turn an inexpensive 1/2"" socket. I had to turn the ratchet mechanism switch back into place a couple times. The tool was fine for limited use, but for a ratchet drive that I would use more often, I would opt for higher quality that this tool just doesn't possess."
2,Broke on first use,"Well, actually second. Tried to tighten up a bolt and this thing crunched and seized. Won't event ratchet anymore!"
5,Recommended,"Like a cross between Star Trek and Bubblegum Crisis. During the first four episodes on the first DVD the crew of the Bilkis is first developed, and then they begin their exciting adventures."
2,Not the best,Have several discs of different cast albums..this is by far the worst sung of the bunch....who cast this ? Chorus I'm happy to say is fine.....
2,2-D Blues,"I heard Kim Wilson on the radio and decided to buy this album, as I am a blues fan. I was disappointed. Yes it's blues, yes it's raw, yes it has good beat, and the harmonica playing is hip, but overall it's pretty two-dimensional, paint-by-numbers stuff to my ears. Bland white man blues with no subtle nuances. And let's face it, his voice is not great by any means. I wasn't particularly impressed by guitarist Duke Robillard either - he seems to be just going through the motions. Perhaps a good album for a party, but it's rather barren musically. For this style of blues I think Charly & the Nightcats do it better, and Ronnie Earl injects more soul-inspired expression. Otherwise go back to black blues and hear what's missing here."
3,60's,"I thought this one would be better than it is. It's okay, but could have better songs on it as far as I'm concerned."
5,ALL THAT GREAT MUSIC AND WONDERFUL SOUND,THIS IS A FANTASTIC CD WITH 26 TRACKS BEAUTIFULLY MASTERED THIS IS ONE THE BEST SOUNDING CD I HAVE HEARD IN MANY YEARS SUPERB ENGINEERING THE SOUND IS OPEN DYNAMIC AND CLEAN .VERY FEW CD DISCS ARE MASTERED THIS WAY TODAY AN OPEN DOOR FOR THE MUSIC . I HOPE OTHER PEOPLE WHO READ THIS HEAR WHAT I HAVE THANK YOU GOOD LISTENING TO ALL
5,"If you love the music from the 60s, you MUST buy this CD!","Do you want remember the music from the 60s?... You MUST buy this cd! The compilation is fantastic! Dell Shannon, Lesley Gore, Manfred Mann, The Supremes, Sonny & Cher, The Beach Boys, The 5th Dimension and many others unforgettable singers and groups... all them in only one cd! It's great!"
5,60's pleasure,This collection of music is for anybody that grew up in the 60's or 70's. This is timeless music of any style. If you like music then you need this cd.
3,Bring back go go boots and mini skirts,"This really brings back early memories for me. I am a teenager of the 70 era, however, I was brought up around my cousins who were older than me and that is why I love this music so much. They would let me play their records (yes I said records) for hours on end so thats why I love the bands of this era also."
3,"Nothing special ,but Glenn Ford fans might want to try on The Green Glove","Glenn Ford stars in this low budget obscure movie with him coming across an art dealer (George Macready) who has a Green Glove (an emerald glove) during WW2. It gets lost during a bomb explosion. Glenn Ford retrieves the glove years later. He is also framed for murder and being tracked down by the French police. This wasn't anything special. It sounded more interesting that it was. The DVD from Alpha is decent. Basically they get the transfer as is, with no touchups and just get it on DVD - so if they get the rights to a movie that has a good transfer, then the transfer will be good. It might be worth renting to some, Glenn Ford completests should give it a try, but dont expect an all time classic. It is not awful, just nothing special either."
2,Doesn't spin,"If this product actually spun around like a lazy susan, which I thought it would, it would have a much better rating. But turning this thing doesn't really work. Would have been better off getting small shelves to fit more baby food in the cabinet."
2,Just ok,This baby food carousel was a good idea but it needs to be excecuted better. Every time I try to spin it around the shelf collapses down to the next shelf. I actually finally just took it off the counter because it was driving me crazy!
3,Works ok for small baby food jars,"This shelf works pretty good for the small stage 1 baby food jars, but it's a little wobbly and doesn't seem like it will hold up well if you place too many of the larger baby food jars on it (stage 2 foods and up)."
3,A little disappointed,"It does save space and allow you to better organize the baby food, but because the shelves slide to lock, spinning the contraption from any shelf other than the base results in the shelves dropping onto the one below. Just something to consider before you buy."
5,Handy!,This is great for organizing baby food. I have a small kitchen and the added room this product provides me is a HUGE help!
5,Easy Peasy!,"Easy to assemble, sturdy, turns easily...can't go wrong! This is the 3rd one of these I have owned...and the best, by far!"
3,"OK, but not very sturdy","The middle level can only hold the small bottle, not the stage 3 bottles. I have tried to adjust the top and the bottle level so the middle can have more room. But the maximum space for middle level seem only fit the small bottle. It looks cheap plastic. Overall, it is functiona but not great."
1,RIDICULOUS DESIGN FLAW!!,"I am on my 5th child, from ages 14 to 6 months...and having used several, this is the WORST organizer I've ever used! Going back immediately. The so-called adjustable shelves CONSTANTLY come out of their ""locked"" position, causing the entire shelf to fall down on the one below it! Pinched my finger in the process, so really glad I didn't ask my younger daughter to get the baby food. Thought at first that I put it together wrong, but didn't, it's really just that poorly designed and therefore useless."
3,"Convenient, but not quite as functional as I expected","I chose this because I thought it spun, it held 24 jars, and was relatively cheap. It was easy to assemble and it cleared up my shelves nicely, but it doesn't rotate, despite the circular bottom having ""wheels"". It seems like it's supposed to spin, but when I tried to move it by pushing on the middle rack, it only made the middle rack unlock and fall and all of my jars fell down. (Thankfully, none broke!)It's still nice to have them all up off of my shelves, but in hindsight, since it doesn't rotate, I wish I'd have gotten the Prince Lionheart drawer organizer that was $5 instead. http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Lionheart-Universal-Drawer-Organizer/dp/B003I85VAA/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1336593127&sr;=8-3-fkmr1"
5,Astonishingly great poetry,"I picked up this little volume and began to read. I know Amichai's work in Hebrew and wanted to see how much came over in English translation. I was astonished. The poems are also tremendously powerful and moving in translation.He opens with a poem of commemoration to a comrade who was killed on the sands of Ashdod in Israel's War of Independence. He writes such a beautiful love poem to his wife Chana, a poem which subtlely remarks on the changing character of love with the years. He writes of meeting tourists in his holy city home Jerusalem, and how they looking for monuments do not see the real thing, the man, the poet with two - shopping bags in his hand on his way home from the market.Amichai is a poet of war and a poet of love. He is a poet of clear colloquial language and the very deepest feeling.Who reads this book will not only have tremendous pleasure, they will know the work of a truly great writer."
4,A venerable but obsolete introduction to microbiology,"This book was already a classic when I first read it in the 1950's. All of the ""142 Illustrations"" touted on the cover are simple line drawings; there are no photos at all and no index. I would recommend this only to someone like myself who waxes nostalgic for biology before DNA's structure and function were discovered, and before microns were called micrometers and only a pretentious Britisher wannabe would spell that ""micrometres"". The raft of gorgeous modern microscopy books for kids are far superior."
1,Disappointing,"The publication quality is very poor. It looks like someone self-published this on their own pc, and the finished product was not professional looking at all. I've seen books that were stapled together better than this. There were no footnotes, bibliography, publisher info, etc. Nothing. Not good as a teaching tool, and not good enough to put on your bookshelf either."
5,The best I've seen for Cisco IP routing.,"This is the first time I wanted to share my review of a book. The examples, the tips on preparing for the CCIE test, and the insights into Cisco routing are the best I have seen in print. The book is outstanding in sharing the real-world experiences of the authors. Plus the book offers you a $1 challenge to the reader to identify any errors."
5,"An excellent, easy-to-read book on routing","Being most excellent practical introduction into IP routing I have ever seen the book covers most of the cases which you might encounter in a mid-sized network or on a CCIE exam. All the cases are well illustrated and complemented with real configurations and printouts. For me the most remarkable part of the book is Chapter 6 - ""Integrating Multiple Routing Protocols"".If you're a looking from theoretical prespective or a start-up book on IOS - this is the wrong book for you.I have to say that there are two major issues that are not covered - large and complex OSPF networks and the secrets and mysteries of BGP.Anyway, if I have to buy this book once again - I'll do it! Add (do not substitute) to it the information from Cisco's web site and you're all set! Good luck!"
4,TC Speed loaders with bullet starter,"A good speed loader which could be improved on by 1 consideration...need to make a recessed starter so you don't damage muzzle loading bullets that have pointed plastic tips, Tried using a drill to make a place for tip to go in without much luck so I got the other push through TC speed loaders. For flat nose saboted bullets or hollow points they work great."
4,Well written biography,Chip Brown does a good job of a third person view of the Waterman's life (and Guy's death). While I didn't like it as well as Laura's account in Losing the Garden it's still a good read and I'd recommend it for anyone interested in another point of view on Guy's life.
4,"4 1/2 stars for a moody, creepily beautiful disc","I love the movie, so I'm a bit biased concerning the soundtrack. I also love Nick Cave, so again, I'm not to be entirely trusted. Still, Warren Ellis and Cave have created another character for this incredible film with the soundtrack. The music is integral to the success of the film; I cannot imagine the movie without hearing the noises Ellis and Cave created. The music crawls and oozes, sinks and stirs. I recommend it highly. Watch the film, buy the music."
2,disappointing,"I loved this film, and the music. However the cd was pretty repetitive, it seemed to play the same theme over and over. What I thought was the best piece of music was not on the cd, from the beginning of the film where a child sang the hymn, There Is a Happy Land. I had higher hopes for the cd, I like the music of these composers."
3,One great cut,"I bought this disk because I couldn't find a single mp3 of ""Happy Land"". The rest of the songs on the disk sounded great in the context of the movie, but not so great on their own."
5,from now on with passion,"Hooray! ""from now on with pasion"" is a how-to book written by someone who ""has been there."" Ms. Casper's examples, insights, and suggestions for achieving dynamic personal growth come from living and working in the corporate world -- not simply ""sounds good"" theory from academia.If you are interested in learning more about the incredible power -- good or bad -- of emotions and how to use them in all aspects of life, this book is a highly recommended read."
5,Putting EQ Into Action,"From Now On With Passion provides an excellent synthesis of the theory of Emotional Intelligence combined with extensive practical application for personal and professional growth. Christine Mockler Casper begins with a review of the literature in the field and offers simple, practicle explanations of the significance of EQ. In the second part of the text, she parallels Goleman's structure to offer advice on improving EQ. In the final section, she offers some higher level application of the materials. Throughout the work, her exercises and assessment tools make the work personal and applicable. An excellent read with substantial payoffs."
4,Great for people with bad hand writing,"Originally I was looking for a way to print out the label inserts for my hanging folders, but this was the closest that I got. They work well and make it easy to see the labels on the folders. I used the online printing method which worked well. They are not perfect, but they are as advertised. They will serve their purpose. Not sure about durability in the long-run, but I am happy so far."
2,Has to be a better option,"First, and this isn't the product's fault, Windows 2007 template for this was dead wrong, fiddled with forever until wised up and downloaded template from Avery, worked fine then.3 reasons for poor review. First, they're actual labels, not just inserts. Means you peel, fold, stick to self, then insert, and if you don't fold just right, you're toast - crooked is the way it will be. Second, by design, it isn't angled like a plastic one would be, makes for difficult viewing. Third, obviously since they're paper, the durability (and stay-clean) factor is limited.Prefer a simple, rectangle insert that isnt' sticky, just thicker paper like my old Esselte Pendaflex ESS43290, which are sadly no longer available. If anyone knows of such a thing for sure, would love to know about it. The Avery ones appear to also be labels like these 5567's but I'm not positive."
3,It's okay.......... not that good.,I thought this book was okay. Not something I would read because I wanted to but instead something I would read to get information out of. if some wano thing conserning that then this would be the perfectbook for them.
4,A very good read,"For those people who do not beleive in History repeating itself ,This novel is a must read. It is a book that pre dates the titanic disaster by about 30 years but the similarities is haunting."
4,the wreck of the titan,this book is interesting especially the first story the wreck of the titan. There are some similarites between this story and the sinking of the titanic its eerie.
4,The Wreck of the Titan or Futility,"While reading this story, I kept thinking I was reading a story about the Titanic. The story was more about the passenger rather than the wreck itself, but the simularities were very eerie. I had never heard of this story before."
5,The Wreck of the Titan or Futility,"Bought this book for my daughter, who had read it several years ago. She had gotten from the library on an inter-library loan. We were glad to find a copy in such great condition, hard back, still in print. The book was published before the Titanic was built, yet it tells the story of a similar ship being built & having the same type of incident where it hits an iceberg & sinks. This was a gift."
4,Brief Titanic like description - But,"As most of the other reviewers noted, there is only a brief description of the Titanic like vessel and it's ice berg destruction. However, if you like a good read of various ship adventures with a little romance, this is the book for you. I enjoyed the descriptions of sea man adventures and experiences.Delivered instantiously on my Kindle"
2,Wreck of The Titan,"This book violates the dictum, ""Write what you know about."" Living on an iceberg following loss of the ship? Polar bears in mid-ocean? With thoughts running together sans punctuation, this work reads like an outline of what the writer intended to expand into a book at some later time."
2,This book was not authored by Nostradamus,"This book was a huge disappointment. I've known of this story for years, but could never get a copy of it until now. The story itself is only about 37 pages long, shouldn't take more than a hour to read, yet seems to never end. The similarities between the Titan and the Titanic are mere coincidences, and the story is choppy and incoherent. This book is not a prophetic work. Perhaps if it were lengthened it would make a decent novel in its own right, but comparing it to the Titanic is a waste of time. If you want to read about a good historical prediction try reading about Cortez's landing in Mexico, and how it coincided with the return of an exciled devil of the Aztecs."
1,Futility,"I would call it an insipid sort of book, very loosely and clumsily constructed. If not for the fact that it resembled the Titanic disasterin some remote way, few would likely know about it. Its coincidence with the Titanic is not nearly so remarkable as some might make out. In fact, the 70-page story contains a few dozen sentences about the Titan and its wreck; most of the rest is unrelated and hard to understand. The style was very abrupt and choppy where the Titan was respected, and too prolific concerning the hero, John Rowland, by the way, who was altogether too heroic. His feminine love was much too perfect, of enough mention was made of her to be able to tell. The story centers selfishly around its hero, who, stranded on an island after the ship sank, one-handedly kills a polar bear with a jack knife to save the heroine's daughter. As for the Titan, it apparently just flops over on its side and sinks."
1,IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE TITANIC...,"This book would not even be of any value. The book had very little to do with the ship, Titan and the storyline that Morgan Robertson applied to the story was scarcely believable. After so much attention was given to the similarities between the Titan and the Titanic, I was expecting more than what I got.I know little about the author but he did write other pieces that had some degree of prophecy associated -- lasers, as US war with Japan, etc. But he could not develop his thoughts and put them down on writing in an entertaining manner."
5,GREAT BOOK! MORAGON 'S BOOK IS SO GOOD FOR 1898,"Whoa!I screamed when i recived it from amazon.com.It was scary.Like a bone chiller,or maybe a thriller.morgan robertson had out done her self.She has a good book to be written in the 1890's.this book should be 100.00.It seems to me to be a rare novel.this book was a prediction.TITAN was related to (TITAN)IC.GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointed,"If you're expecting a story about the sinking of a Titanic like ship, you'll be sadly disappointed. The story is really about a misunderstood sailor who is in love with a woman who despises him. He ends up saving the woman's daughter when the ship goes down. How he and the girl survive on an iceberg for days is unclear especially with the author's traditional British prose."
5,WOW!!! This book is incredible!!!,"As a ""Titantic fanatic"" I loved reading this book! If you believe in fate, coincidence, or premonitions this is the book for you... It took me FOREVER to find this book - thank you for reprinting it for the rest of us to enjoy. It's amazing how many creepy coincidences this book contains regarding the Titan and the Titanic.Using the original cover design was very cool too. We've shown the book to several of our ""Titanic"" obsessed friends who have ordered copies of their own."
3,How could he be so psychic?,"Either this guy is psychic, or these stories were not written when they are said to have been. The story of the Titanic already was so amazing, so fantastic that it is easy to imagine that it may just be a story. Everything that happened with that ship was so perfectly fitting for a disaster on its maiden voyage, so good a story, that it actually was in ""Futility"". But I ask you, how could so many details be so acurately described, even the name of the ship(Titan)? It is truly amazing. And that is why I, or anyone, has reason to believe that this story possibly was not written 1896, but after the real disaster. Think about it- it is just as logical, even more so, that ""Futility"" was written afterwards. And I see no way to prove either way, really."
1,Not the same,"This book has a few similarities to the RMS Titanic, but it is just a short story about a man who was on the Titan. It is not the same book that was written 14 years before the Titanic. If that is what you are looking for DONT buy this book. It does have an interesting twist, but not what I was looking for."
5,Compelling,It was sad and compelling. It was a stirring book and was gripping. I almost never put it down and cried at some parts.
1,You're going to be disappointed,"This book has always been said to have been a foretelling of the Titanic disaster, but aside from a few coincidences, it's not that much.The story is boring and trite, and if you have read a list of the similarities between what happened and what Robertson put in his book, then you have most of it."
3,"No, this is not the same Books","No offense to the artist responsible for this album, but this is not the Books responsible for Lost and Safe, The Lemon Pink, and Thought For Food.I dont have much of an opinion on this Books."
2,Doesn't get hot enough,"I am not sure if it is defective but it doesn't curl my hair at all. I set it to the hottest temperature ( which totally scares me) hold it on my hair for 20 seconds and the curl falls our within 5 seconds, with hair spray, it makes no sense! My hair usually will curl on a medium to low heat after just touching the iron. I threw away all of the packaging Because I was so sure it was going to work, I might try a smaller size to see if its just me or if its defective, but i definitely won't throw away the packaging this time!"
2,Doesn't work,I'm asian and my hair is medium in thickness. My hair uncurls once I get to the other side of my head. I've used other ones that were better and lasted me more than one day without any sprays. This one might work for you if you have fine hair.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this curling iron,My hairdresser recommended it to me and I am in love with it now. It makes curling your hair super easy. I definitely recommend it!
2,Marcel Curling Iron,"I was disappointed with the curling iron, only because I did not realize it was for professional use. There was no spring in the handle and unless you work as a professional it would be hard to use this iron. I returned it, and as usual Amazon made it right by refunding me."
1,Mostly fluff,"Three fourths of the book are excepts from the trial transcripts. They are cherry picked from the 5,000 pages in the Commonwealth ans Appel volumes, and no explanation is given as to what is included, and what was left out. Since what is included is about 10% of the total, this is a large gap.The last quarter of the book is the author critiquing other authors. There is little of substance here. He includes as a ground breaking discovery a letter about Orciani's effort to manufacture an alibi for Vanzetti's pistol. Without any other background on the strategies and tactics of the defense from 1920-27, this is out of context and meaningless for both new students to the case, and researchers.The book is not a comprehensive transcript. It is also not a history of the case. I am beyond annoyed that I bought this book, it is quite useless. At best it is a review of other people's work, and numerous online sites do the same, but more effectively."
4,Just Plain Fun,"Doyle has played with the best and even taught the best. This is the man that shaped SRV's vocal style. This is an impressive collection of music with many great artists. The remake of Hound Dog Taylor's ""She's Gone"" is a great rendition of an already raw blues jam. ""Take Your Time Son"" is another great tune. I can't get enough of a great blues shuffle like this one. Doyle Jr. and Jimmie Vaughan are having a ton of fun on this track. This cd is more than worth the money. A smart investment for any blues collector."
2,"high in ambitions, low in substance","you might think that a book titled ""java application frameworks"" would give you practical insights and techniques for designing applications.the book runs through the idea of frameworks, patterns, beans punctuated by ""THOUGHTS"", ""NOTES"" ""design guidelines"" boxes, cartoon figures.the material lacks depth, coverage and cohesion and possesses all the features of wordy contrivance.the cartoons are completely superfluous to the material, the notes talk of ""spacerestrictions, references to other books"" and the thoughts jump around like those of dosteyevsky's characters. Many go like ""if you think you need two rather than one , then use two...""there is some code - definitely not very practical examples - i am not sure what it illustrates - but you can find it on wiley's site ... if you are considering.don't throw away that purchase receipt."
2,Confusing examples,"The subject is very interesting and the author definitely knows what he is talking about, but the book is hard to follow. I always liked books that have good examples, like books by Kernighan & Ritchie or Bruce Eckel. Meaningless examples is the biggest problem with this book. Although the author tried to stay brief and at the high level of abstraction, this should not have prevented him from trying to come up with some examples that illustrate the subject well and entertain the reader. Many examples in this book have bugs because they were never tested.Advice - wait till the Java patterns book by James W. Cooper becomes available at the stores, or download it from the Net."
5,Great economics classic,"I have had this book (put out by a different publisher several decades ago) in my library for about six years now. I first came across the name of Condy Raguet by reading Murray Rothbard. And then I went and tracked down Condy Raguet's books.This book has been out of publication for several years, and I had to pay about $40 for an older copy that is in good condition. It is great to see this book in print again.Condy Raguet does a salient job at explaining what the pathological genesis is of booms and busts, how a gold standard would virtually eliminate booms and busts, and the reasons why gold should be our money again. This is a book that Ben Bernanke ought to read."
3,Stan and Ollie's Farewell,"Originally released as ""Atoll K"" in 1951, ""Utopia"" is superior to Laurel and Hardy's post-Hal Roach efforts of the 1940s. Despite their ill health, Stan and Ollie remain seasoned comedy pros in this admirably offbeat French-Italian production. The team's cinematic swansong includes some memorable sight gags and a surprising amount of political satire. Though flawed, it's a better film than some critics would have you believe."
3,DESPERATLEY NEEDS REMASTERING,"Bit slow to begin with, but the pace improves as the movie goes on. Poor Stevie didn't deserve to get blown up, but sadly if he hadn't have been the movie would not have had the impact that it did. Needs a few viewings to truly appreciate it, but that seems to be the way with most HITCHCOCK movies.My main complaint is that the overall picture and sound quality of the movie is very poor. I realise that the movie is 70 years old at the time of writing, but if it's been around this long, it's fair to assume it'll be around for another 70, so why doesn't somebody put up some money and restore it! And while ther'e at it, why not do the rest of his early (British) catalogue"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though it lacks the narrative thrust and humor that characterize Hitchcock's later work, Sabotage is a suspenseful and brief thriller that hints at what the master had cooking for us in later decades; recommended mainly to fans of Hitch, it's a good but not great film."
4,Exellent British Thriller!,"Hitchcock made this brilliant thriller the same year he made ""The Secret Agent"" and although the above is a great movie, ""Sabotage"" is much better.In this movie a woman finds out that she is married to a saboteur. Unfortunately she finds out too late. You see it seems that Mr. Verloc has sent her brother out on a small errand. (Here comes the spoiler- IF YOU DON'T WANT IT RUINED FOR YOU QUIT READING) What the kid (yes, it's a young child) doesn't know is that he is delivering a bomb against the clock. Things get in his way and surpriseingly in theis movie, the suspence ends with a shock. Indeed the kid gets blown up.Now, in this scene Hitch uses the camera and the use of montage quite geniously. It really is quite a spectacle.When Mrs. Verlock finds out and her husband is less than greiving she gets the sudden urge to kill him. The scene with the knife on the table is great!This is a must for thriller fans!!! You seriously need to check it out."
4,A suspenseful but dated film,"This film shows how good Hitchcock was even in his early films. The suspense is palpable, especially when the boy is carrying the bomb. However, some parts are clearly outdated; they would have been done differently today. People sometimes move about and show facial expressions as if they were still acting in a silent film."
3,Early Hitchcock films were hit and miss,"In the period before Alfred Hitchcock came to America to direct, he occasionally made films that verged on incredibly boring. This film, in my opinion, is one such. An undercover cop tries to detect a London saboteur, and we see the plot unfold as everything becomes clear. A painfully slow film, only true Hitchcock loyalists will want to watch this one."
4,Not my book but...,"I purchased this book for my husband who is very serious about his land! He didn't put it down until he finished it. He said the information was great and that, although he knows a lot, he learned a lot from this book. It now has little post-its marking those valuable pages. It was well worth the price!"
2,"Fair story, laboured and unnecessarily complex language","I'm a great fan normally, and it's true that the story here is interesting and involving, if not as comprehensive as others he has written. But the language! It reads as if he has swallowed a grammar and some sort of ""how to write a classic in one go"" instruction manual. I lost all sense of spontaneity, it was murdered by the complexities of the verbal games he played. NOT his best work, by far."
2,Sinks like a stone,"Here is the perfect example of why some authors should be considerably less prolific than they actually are. A stale, tired and souless post apocalyptic story with absolutely nothing new to offer. Shame Iain Banks, shame. Someone of your calibre really should have known better."
5,"Another dark, imaginative and gripping novel.","Set in the aftermath of a civil war, where bands of looters lay waste to what little remains of civilisation. A couple flee what was once their ancestral castle, only to be stopped and returned there by a psuedo-military unit. The castle now becomes the focus for a dangerous game played between the female lieutenant and the main character, Abel. You can only be gripped by the twists and turns the story makes, hoping against hope, that there is some escape for the couple (now prisoners), and their people camped on the castle grounds. Ultimately the conquest by the unit of an enemy gun brings a celebration, one which unleases the ""madness of war"" and utimately triggers a typical dark and savage ending. ""Song of Stone"" is one of my favourite books and again Iain Banks manages to weave a dark and compelling novel which explores some of the moral questions of the world today."
2,An author on auto-pilot,"I am wary of spending time on any of Ian (M) Banks's recent works. He always tries hard to experiment with new ideas and forms. But for quite some time now, he just hasn't been able to come up with any compelling material. This book covers (yet again) themes that are hallmarks of previous work, including a fascination for war and weapons, incest and the eccenticities of the aristocracy. But he has nothing particularly interesting to say about any of these, and no matter how hard Mr Banks tries to re-deal his cards these days, it is from the same old, dog-eared pack. Here, he also tries too hard to intellectualise his threadbare material, making one wonder at the end 'just what did I read that for'? Perhaps this effort could have made a reasonable short story, but I think Mr Banks must have some hardback contracts to satisfy, and so turned his thin material into his annual hardback output. It certainly shows."
2,Least impressive Banks' book I've read so far...,"While Ian Banks is one of the most interesting writers I've come across in the last few years, unfortunately ""A Song of Stone"" is one of the least engaging novels I've ever finished. Muted, yet overwrought, this tale of dissolution is less shocking than turgid. The extended and tedious stretches of ""purple prose"" in this disappointing book, which were apparently consciously intended to embody the self-absorbed and effete mental state of the protagonist and narrator, did little but lose my flagging interest repeatedly. Coyly lurid, and basically quite unsatisfying, this dim variation on an apocalyptic, Road Warrior-ish theme goes nowhere and then dies...Read anything else by Banks before or instead of ""A Song of Stone"". Though I do rather enthusiastically recommend Banks as an author, I can't in good conscience give thumbs up to this book."
3,Unsettling but not groundbreaking...,"It seems to be generally agreed upon that this is not one of Iain Banks' finest works. In Song of Stone, Banks has plucked some successful elements from previous works and placed them in a new novel. It's not, however, a retread of ideas but some of the imagery might be familiar to Banks fans. Normally, Banks could make something like this work, however the story that he developed in A Song of Stone is not all that gripping.That being said, this is still a piece of Banks' fiction. I don't blindly praise favorite authors' works but there is something inherent in Banks' fiction that exists here as well. Banks is wonderful at making the reader uncomfortable. If for nothing else, this book is a perfect example of Banks' darkness and the quiet horror he can cause readers - something he has in common with J.G. Ballard.My advice - read all the Banks stuff you can get your hands on. Some are better than others but all are worth a read."
1,Turgid and overwrought,"Doomed by turgid and overwrought prose, this story dies unborn. Banks seems more intrigued by his ability to present the reader with both decadent and debauched imagery than with a functional storyline, or characters that assume any more qualities than cardboard cutouts. Overall, this book comes off as being unfortunately amateurish; Banks is more enamoured with utilising his vast vocabulary than with writing a story."
1,Limited Appeal,"I don't review many books here but the thought that a little effort on my part would save someone else from having to read this awful book made up my mind to do so.I loved the author's ""Consider Phoebus"", and decided to buy some more of his work. If I had read ""A Song of Stone"" first, I would have avoided him like the plague.If you like first-person narratives from whiney, incompetent protagonists who spent half their time spouting trite, sophomoric philosophy, then you may just enjoy this book. If not, don't waste your money."
3,"Interesting, but can get tiresome.","Interesting novel. It has distinct style which could be viewed as either eloquent or wordy. Although metaphors and allusions were intriguing at first, they grew tiresome towards the end."
4,Brilliant as ever,"As always, Banks is brilliant with words and spins a yarn that gets you tangled quickly and permanently. I could not quite understand what the message is supposed to be if there is one but this might be due to my not being British. This is not his best by far, but you will not be disappointed, whether you have read anything else by him or not."
3,Strangely Unsatisfying,"As a long-time fan of Iain Banks' novels (particularly The Wasp Factory, The Crow Road, and Espedair Street), I was left with mixed feelings about A Song of Stone. While it is very well written, and was an easy and quick read, it ultimately seemed, to me, to have little real point. Unlike some of the other reviewers I didn`t find this book all that shocking or gruesome but sort of by the numbers in its hinting at the horribleness of his postapocalyptic future. I never really felt the horror that I think he wanted us to feel. Ultimately, I was left with a feeling about the banality of Banks' vision. Still, the totally self-absorbed and cynical narrator was, for the most part, a successful creation--the best part of the novel.A Song of Stone is worth reading, but ultimately seemed to have a void at is centre."
3,Not one of his best.,"Banks is Scottish not English, as one of the above reviews states. Only read this book if you've read every other Banks novel and are can't do without his books."
3,Human nature unfettered,This book explores the worst of human behavior. It is very believable and I really think these types of things have happened before. It's about refugees trying to escape a war that is encroaching upon the countryside. It happens that they run up on a military unit that takes charge. What follows is what humans do.The book is very grim and explores the dark side of human nature. I found it to be a powerful experience.
3,Disturbing....,"I haven't read any of Iain Banks' novels before I picked up ""A Song of Stone"" so I can't honestly say if it is his usual standard or if it's better or worse than his other works. Reading some of the other reviews on here, however, I do agree that he has a gift of making people feel uncomfortable. Abel's reflections on violence and incest was troubling to say the least. I thought the story slow-moving and felt like I was going around in the same circle the whole time, but perhaps that was Banks' intention to create a dismal atmosphere where one's trapped, and there's no escape except through death (for us, thankfully, the completion of the novel would suffice!) The underlying sexual tension with the female lieutenant was interestingly dealt with, however, and that was probably the only part of the novel where there was visible progress. I should need to read more of Banks' work to decide if I like him or not....if I have the desire to sink into depression again....."
2,One of Banks' Worst,"Of all the Iain Banks novels I've read (and that's all but 3), this is my least favorite. In fact, I didn't enjoy it at all. The main character is not particularly likeable, drives you nuts with his inability to act, and remains the most likeable person in the novel. The ending is unpleasant, to say the least.In spite of the ""M."" in the author's name, this is not a work of science fiction or The Culture (he writes under two names, with and without the M, to distinguish between his science and mainstream fiction). The novel takes place somewhere more like war-torn Bosnia.Of all his books, this is the only one I'll get rid of, because I will *never* read it again. Pick up The Crow Road instead, a much better read."
5,Love it,I definitely love these old classic gospel songs because they are sung the way gospel music should be sung.Thank you
3,Puffin book from Amazon,"I was looking for a puffin story for young children that also included puffin biology. Although this is a very nice story, it could just have easily been a rabbit, fox or owl as the main character. I wrote my own book about puffins and it is just what I wanted, of course. And my grandchildren really like it."
4,a well researched contribution,"Lobbying at the EU level has been getting a lot of attention recently so the question arises whether another book on the subject can really tell us something new. This one, at least, can. Particularly interesting is Van Schendelen's introduction which nicely suggests the questions we should ask about the lobbying process: who, why, on whom, where, on what, when and how.While most case studies focus on business (as usual) the most interesting chapters deal with non-profit organisations. Fisher chronicles the campaign to ban the use of animals for cosmetics research while other authors deal with legislation on the rights of pregnant women and the activities of amnesty international.Both case studies and the general introduction (as well as the conclusion) fit together well and provide valuable insights into lobbying in Brussels."
2,occasional sparks of brilliance....,....mixed in with a reductionistic theory whose centerpiece implies that the cure for neurosis is having sex more often. At times I wished the author had taken his own advice in lieu of writing such a long and drawn-out book...or that I had taken his advice instead of reading it all. Scattered useful clinical concepts.
4,Eye-Catching Book,I bought this book for a friend because I knew immediately that he would like it. The book has amazing artwork; the pictures are absolutely beautiful. Each painting is described as to how it came about with wonderful stories. Truly a neat book.
3,"Fantastic music and performances, poor editing!","I am sorry to bring the rating of this product down. However, I think people who are considering buying this DVD should know what I experience. The performances are indeed wonderful, especially Bronfman's playing is larger than life. The sound and picture quality are great EXCEPT the sound and picture are not in sync most of the time, probably a result of integrating many camera angles. One would think the technologies nowadays would have no problem resolving the issue but it is not the case here. And this drove me nut, I had to close my eyes to enjoy the concert. If you want to see how bad it is, maybe clips on YouTube would give you some ideas. The picture is usually behind the sound in most views. The conductor's view seems to be the only one that is in sync with the sound."
2,Great Conducting & Picture Audio is below standard,"I was excited to have this blu-ray for my audiophile ,however as another review noted this is not a studio recording so dont expect the sound to be anything close to a CD even !! no stage the sound is so empty with kids crying in the bakground (very low and not anyoing to be fair) that is why i gave it two star"
4,good product... multiple uses,"The root soaker is a good product especially in our drought stricken times. Used to water trees, shrubs and plants and was able to get at least a foot down... my soil is particularly bad with lots of rocks/ boulders. Would be good to start holes for fences because of the hydraulic pressure of the tool. Paint finish wore off fairly quickly and needs to be oiled with vegatable oil to keep rust off.Definitly a good purchase... especially for the price!"
2,medicore at best,"leaks around connection even with new gasket/o ring and rusts fast. Gets the job done but leaks like crazy and gets you wet while using. My opinion, pass."
2,Root Soaker,Disappointed that it only has a single hole pointing straight down...not really a good piece of equipment...suggest some other soaker that has side holes!
4,Excellent for teens,My daughter very much enjoyed this cd. I don't know why a review cannot be short and to the point and requires a million words.
2,Seems more for adults...,"I purchased this CD, along with several others, because my daughter really likes Lori Lite's Garden of Wellness and her original version of Indigo Dreams. Much to our dismay, the first half of this CD seems to be a dissertation on the definitions of ""affirmation"" and the like spoken by a man with a very un-soothing voice. I felt like I was back in my college history class. I don't know many adults, let alone teens, who would find this relaxing. Perhaps, a change in title with an emphasis on TECHNIQUE is in order. Likewise, a change in narrator might help. On the positive side, the second half of the CD contains some lovely, ethereal music which IS relaxing..."
1,students did not like,"I work with students with ""emotional disturbances"" in a small school setting. The students are mostly male in the range of 12 to 15 years of age. This CD did not resonate with this group. They did not like it at all and asked to turn it off."
3,Good for younger teens,As a therapist I would recommend this product for younger teens only. Most teens 15 and up would probably find the cd childish. Seems to be a good fit for ages 10/11 through 14.
3,good introduction to meditation,"My daughter who had been weepy and sleepless, found herself giggling hysterically to this cd the first time I put it on. I considered this a good thing. And although she thought it was dorky (repeating ""I am a good person"" while she felt terrible caused much laughter), she vowed to do it each night as the relaxation techniques later on the CD worked for her. I listened for a few minutes and thought the affirmations were a bit awkward and the music was a bit dorky. But all in all it's given my teenager a good attitude about meditation and for that I think it's a decent start."
5,For a taste -- check out the website!,"To fully understand this book, you need to visit Lyle's website: http://zapatopi.net/ and the associated Aluminum Foil Deflector Beanie (AFDB) pages.Lyle is a creative genious, and I'm really glad that he is working on the good guy's side.After reading his site and the book, I must say that I have invested heavily in Reynold's Aluminum corporation, and am trying to get my friends and colleagues to understand the threat that we all face from those that would control us."
2,Beware: Aluminum doesn't work,"The concept is to place a faraday cage around your head, but what the unseen forces who seek to control your mind, DON'T want you to know is that ALUMINUM does not work. In fact, use of aluminum has been proven in scientific studies to profoundly exacerbate Alzheimer's and other ravaging mental diseases and illnesses. USE OF ALUMINUM WILL FACILITATE MENTAL INSTABILITY MAKING THE WEARER MORE SUSEPTABLE TO MIND CONTROL RAYS!!!The best metallic hats to use are molded TINFOIL lined with circular dispersal radiators (items that resemble the springs found in retractable fountain pens.) These springs should be placed every 1/4 inch and all turned opposite directions of each other... one turning clockwise, one turning counter clockwise, etc.Remember, ALUMINUM KILLS. This is serious, I AM NOT A KOOK!!! YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME, I AM ONLY TRYING HELP!!!"
1,Lies and deception!,"What the author doesn't want you to know is that aluminum is insufficiently conductive to form a true Faraday cage over your brain! This book offers only the ILLUSION of security, while simultaneously leaving its readers woefully defenseless against the devastating scourge of psychotronic mind-control rays.The MK-Ultra experiments proved that only with a Faraday Brain Protective Device made of copper - COPPER, YOU FOOLS! - could the psychotronic rays be adequately screened out, leaving the mind of the wearer protected against all known forms of thought manipulation!!This book is sheer deception on the part of the government, designed to leave you totally unguarded against their nefarious machinations!Think I'm wrong, paranoid, or just crazy?... Explain why everyone's forgotten about the Gulf oil spill, then."
3,"Okay, but not enough darkness for me","First of all, I would like to tell everyone that this book contains BLACK AND WHITE DRAWINGS only. I bought it expecting at least a few illustrations in full colour like the amazing looking cover.As for the actual drawings themselves, I liked a couple of them but there was not really anything that I found as good or as satisfying as the cover. It's not exactly bad art, but I just didn't find anything that was particularly interesting. Just your standard fantasy females.Overall I'd say I found the book rather disappointing. It needed a lot more darkness and nastiness and weird creatures and evil beings, etc.This is one of those books you end up hanging onto only because you like the cover. (This is what I am now doing.)"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TRIPE,"As the other reviewer said, neither one of these movies is all that bad (I quite enjoyed them both) but Warner Brothers has become a bunch of liars as of late. The back of the box CLEARLY states these are WIDESCREEN and the movies are NOT widescreen at all. They are presented in crappy full frame and had they been marked correctly on the packaging I would have saved my hard earned money."
1,not worth it.....,"bought this thing about 3 weeks ago. And for the first 2 weeks it was fine, and I couldn't have been happier with my purchase, but then during week 3 the Ipod started to freeze up on me, and I couldn't get it working again. And apple's tech support was no help, they basically restated the same stuff from the support section on their website. Waste of money....I'm sure there's a better mp3 player somewhere....hopefully I'll find it...this was too much money to spend on something that was just going to break down 3 weeks after I bought it."
2,Very dissatisfied,When my daughter began downloading music to the ipod it immediately froze and was not functioning at all.The ipod was returned and another ipod(same brand) was mailed to me immediately.A couple of months later it froze again.I didn't bother to return the product and disposed it.
5,Impartial review?,"Chris Yeh is Mr. Kuegler's partner at his consulting firm.I would question the objectivity of the previous review.Please also place no credence in my rating of five stars, I have yet to receive my copy."
1,response to 'Reality Check',"Dr Hagar is not ""out in June 2004."" In fact, he has been appointed for another year (starting in June 2004). Time magazine reported that ""In his private practice, two sources familiar with it say, Hager refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women."" Do not buy this guy's book. If you must, borrow it from a church."
2,Poor,"This is a 350 page book with no table of contents, a poor index and the worst chapter organization I have ever seen. Want to know about Cattleyas? You basically thumb through the book looking for ""Cattleyas"". There are many chapters on them, the chapters are not sequentially organized and the pages have no indication of what chapter you are in.If you want to read it front to back, it's fine, but referencing a specific subject is impossible without endlessly paging through the book.The author needs a much better editor than she has."
5,Won't you keep us working?,"Mark of the Mole is quintessential Residents. This is an epic album that tells of the arduous plight of the mole people. Although many humans may not categorize this as ""music,"" it is nonetheless an emotional journey into the world of the mole people. How else can one understand their plight without listening to the dreadful mole wails accompanied by harmonic melodies? The Residents concept albums are best understood with visual accompaniment, but the sounds within this auditory journey paint a landscape in and of themselves.Some of the synthesizer technology may be dated, but the pure emotional representation the Residents achieve through bizarre electronic harmonic and atonal hooks still capture my imagination of the mole people. After all, are we much different from our mole brothers and sisters?"
2,The Goons deserved better,"Anyone who's heard the Goon Shows knows they were masters of absurdist comedy, and this film sadly contains little of that quality. The four Goons take on a single character from the Goon Show's plethora of characters for ""Down Among The Z-Men"".The plot is pretty meager, concerning two thieves who want to steal an atomic formula from Michael Bentine. Harry Secombe plays a store clerk who accidentally winds up in the army, where Spike Milligan plays numbskull Private Eccles and Peter Sellars is General Bloodnok.The films tries hard to be entertaining with goofy routines, musical numbers, etc, but is pretty understocked with laughs. It's certainly not the fault of the Goons, but of the dumb story they were cast in. Yet I still enjoy the film as a typical bit of early-fifties fluff and others might who are hard-core Goon fans, if only as a novelty.The cover box picture of Peter Sellars is not from the film, but the way..."
5,"It's all relative, isn't it Auntie?","There's lots of reasons to like this DVD. First, there's the price. Second, there's several lovely moments with Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers. Third, we get to see Spike play a few moments of jazz trumpet. Fourth, we get jazz strumpet -- or rather the next best thing, the lovely dancing Topper Girls. They were excellent. Fifth, did I mention the price? This is really a light variety show, BBC-TV 1950s style. There's a very lose plot that connects events -- but let's not worry about that. The Goons certainly didn't. Michael Bentine is not that funny. But he does try. He certainly tries me. Oh and sixth, it comes in a cardboard sleeve, so the DVD won't take up much space on your shelf. I found the whole thing charming, and I'm happy to have this historical artefact featuring some of two of my favourite comedians."
1,Not compatible - stay away,"This is not compatible with MOST Creative media players and definitely not compatible with Zen Vision, Vision W or Zen JukeBox Xtra. Waste of money and can't return it once you pop the blister seal on the package."
2,"Disappointed this time,","I have to disagree with the other three reviews and simply state, I was really disappointed with this story, it lacked the emotional attatchment with her characters that her previous books have had. The story line was extremely far fetched and really not believable at all. The ending was really really really disappointing. I had a hard time actally reading the end and quite honestly, just skimmed it, I was that disappointed with it. Ms. Creswell, had spent a lot of time building up to a climax that just didn't pan out, it was if she realized she had enough pages and had to wrap it all up. It just wasn't worthy of her other stories. I would suggest reading The Daughter, The Disappearance and The Inheritance rather than this one. I hope she regains the momentum for her next book. I look forward to her stories, especially since she only puts one out per year. I certainly won't be keeping this one, into the donation pile it will go."
3,Disapointing,"Ms Cresswell's novels are generally very good to excellent. She ties several features together into readable and enjoyable mysteries with well-developed characters. In this novel, her male protagonist is an ex-FBI agent -- but he totally misses several clues, and harbors no suspicions about the murderer. This is not believeable."
5,A book that keeps you reading all night!,"I read this book and couldn't ever put it down.Full of adventure,mystery, and fun;this book has earned its name.People of all ages enjoy reading and listening to it over and over;again and again.I think that this is one of the best children's fictional books ever written and certainly one of Doctor Dolittle's most exciting adventures yet"
4,Loved the book but had issues with stereotypes,"Although I loved the story about a man being able to talk to and understand animals, I found the racial stereotypes offensive. This is similar to the situation I found when I read Huckleberry Finn many years ago. Also, I found the use of a Jew as the pawnbroker to be offensive (although I haven't read any other comments about that situation). While I didn't read Dr. Dolittle to my children, I am debating reading it to my granddaughter just because it was lots of fun to read and brought me lots of smiles. It is a very easy book to read, very lighthearted and although it is not a short book, I read it very quickly in less than two days. So, despite these issues, I would still recommend this book."
3,Lots of exciting adventures,"Tommy Stubbins is thrilled to make the acquaintance of the esteemed Doctor Doolittle. Doolittle has the amazing ability to talk to animals and he loves to travel; these two combine to send him off on many adventures. And Tommy is able to come along, a witness to all the adventures of the doctor. They meet up with the world's greatest naturalist, Long Arrow, on a floating island. The doctor teaches the people of Spain a new way to fight bulls. And the doctor is made king."
5,Excellet book!,"This was a very fascinating book. It was not at all like the movie Dr. Dollitle(besides the point that they can talk to animals. If you did not read this book, you must. It is a great book!"
2,don't buy the Kessinger Publishing hardcover,"After reading reviews about the beautiful illustrations that accompany the re-release of this book, I was eager to purchase a copy for my nephew. However, when the hardcover copy printed by Kessinger Publishing (no date) arrived, I was disappointed to find that not only does it contain no illustrations, but it looks almost like a textbook. It is housed in an a very unattractive plain blue cover, and the font and layout made me feel like it was a homework assignment. I can't imagine this edition appealing to anyone - new readers or old."
3,Double Dare,"Watching this documentary video on various stunt people proved very interesting, learning about the poeple through the DVD proved easy, definitely worth watching if anyone wants an understanding about this type of career."
3,You don't get a lot of bang for your buck.,"If you LOVE Grindhouse Death Proof, which is why i got it, then you should get this with free points or couch money. It's like the missing documenty that should have been in the Death Proof DVD. If you like Zoe Bell, Xena, or Death Proof then get it!"
5,loved it,I saw Zoe Bell at a Xena Convention promoting the film and I thought it would be very interesting. I just loved it. I found it fasinating. How hard they work and how much passion it takes. Jeannie Epper what a great lady. I didn't know how much I had enjoyed her work till I saw this. She was in Wonder Woman and Romancing The Stone I loved that and I was amazed that she is still working. What saddened me was that woman in the industry are still struggling. It seems strange since they take so much risk because there is no where to hide the padding that they are not honored more. I was just so pleased with this. What great movie.
5,Rammstein Fans,"If you like Rammstein, you'll like this CD. It's one of those albums that grows on you the more you listen. I highly recommended."
2,Didn't work for my camera,"I ordered my compactflash and it arrived very quickly. The size was the right fit for my camera, however, when I inserted the compactflash into my camera, it said there was no memory available, which means that the card is useless at this point unless I give it to some one else who has a camera that will allow it to work. I don't know if it's my camera thats at fault (Nikon 4300) or the card itself. I wished when I ordered, information was provided about which cameras these cards are best used for. I am pretty disapointed that this card, which was the right size, didn't work for my camera. I decided not to return it because it was only about 15 bucks and perhaps, I will find someone with an adaquate camera that will allow this card somehow magically to work. I would like to believe my camera is at fault, so that this card is useable in some way."
5,Supplies for my photographer,"Fast delivery. I gave it to the photograpther I hired, all I can say is the I am very happy with his work."
5,Ah... more room to breathe!,"So, I got this with a package deal. I got a flash, diffuser, and this card. With my Canon 300D, in the small, med, and large settings I get 999 photos. I can't tell how many pics over that I have. But I'm really happy because in the RAW format, I can now get 442 RAW photos versus the 132 from the 1 gig card I had.Great buy! Totally worth it!"
5,awesome card,"This memory card is awesome. I purchased it as an upgrade to my 512 mb card. Let me tell you 4gb is a ton of space. This card will be used in my Canon Rebel XTI, and on the highest setting it will hold approx. 900 photos, and on the lowest setting over 5000. I will be purchasing another card very soon. I would recommend this card to anyone."
1,Didn't work . . . am sending it back.,I tried to use this on my vacation and just got an error message. I am in the process of returning it. I don't fault the seller. . . sometimes you just get a faulty disk.
3,Good but slow transfer rate data,"Yes,... good capacity, but slow. I'm changing to a Ducati extra module. I need speed to take photos and transfer to my desktop."
5,I Own 5,"I own five of these. The first one I bought at least a year and a half ago, maybe two. Not a problem with any of them, ever. They're fast and at a good price point. If you do any kind of action photography where your camera's buffer comes into play it's worth the extra money to buy a card that will read and write faster."
5,"Worked well, Used in wedding",I purchased a few of these and they work great. I used them with video mode and 8fps on my 7d and had no problems during the wedding. I think thats all that needs to be said about this.**EDIT** I thought this card was great but now I have had the card lock up on me at two weddings. I have had it happen on two of these cards now. I would look into another card.
4,Always dependable,"I've always had good experiences with SanDisk CF Cards, they are very dependable. I started getting the SanDisk CF cards when the average size was a 512. They've always been dependable card for us in a professional setting."
1,"Won't work, system error","I purchased this card to use with my Nikon CoolPix camera. I inserted the card and a message said it was unreadable ""do you want to format"", so I formated as instructed. Well, the only thing that happened was I received a ""system error"" message and my camera stuck on that screen. I couldn't get it to do anything. I had to remove the card and batteries, reinsert the old card and batteries before it would work. I contacted the seller on 26 September 2012 and asked for help. I received a ""your items was shipped, contact Amazon"" email???? They NEVER answered my question. I would suggest you skip this seller and this product as well."
5,Bought 2 - they both work fine,"SanDisk SDCFH-004G-A11 4GB/15MB Ultra II CF Card ( US Retail Package )What can I say. I bought 2 for my new trailcam.After 3 months out in the bitter cold, rain, and snow they both still work fine.During that time the Reconyx took over 4200 pictures."
5,Speedy Flash Card - Buy 2 or more before going on a vacation.,Compact Flash has become so cheap now that its worthwhile buying a new card before every vacation/event. The 4GB is especially handy compared to the days where one was juggling 20 cards. I have had good experiences with SanDisk.
3,Wrong interface,"The device probably works fine. This is a review of the service after the sale. This is NOT the card for the D80. Don't be fooled by the amazon selling pitch ""those who bought...also bought..."". I was fooled into thinking this was the card that goes with the Nikon D80 camera. The seller, Blue Proton only has a 15 day return policy. Very poor. After I realized it, it was too late to return it. And it was shipped without a receipt or return paper work. Nothing. Lesson: always read the return policy of the seller, in this case, Blue Proton."
2,Unaware of two types of compact flash,"After putting it in my camera, nothing happened. Sandisk informed me that there are two types, and of course I bought the wrong kind without any information on the discription or even on the product packaging mentioning this type may not work with your particular camera."
1,Don't Risk!,"I got it for my Digital camera (Canon Digital Rebel XT)Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 Lens (Silver)it doesn't work! Honestly, I took a few picture with that, but after that the camera gave me error message and didn't accept it anymore. The packing also was awful, I haven't seen this kind of ugly packing before, without any box. I don't recommend this ""ULTRA"" company at all. Now, I have a 2GB CF card Kingstone which is working very well. I wish I wouldn't take this ""4GB"" ""ULTRA"" ""II"" CF card!!"
1,Get Something Better,"I have an older Olympus E-20N digital SLR. This is a high performance camera and it came with a 32M card which will only hold a few pictures. I wanted a larger capacity card so I bought this one thinking 'It's a CompactFlash card, it'll work.' WRONG!!!! My camera wouldn't recgonize it and it couldn't be formatted, either. I had bought this at a local store which wouldn't take it back so now I'm stuck with a card that I can't use. Maybe it's my older camera, I don't know. I say if you have any doubts, don't buy it."
5,Perfect Gadget Gift!,"My husband was shocked and pleased when I remembered that he had been wanting a larger storage card for his PDA (to use as a GPS). He has said that it is extremely fast and convenient. Highly recommended, and at a GREAT price!"
2,too slow,"i use the Extreme III but after reading reviews they say it's too fast that i dont need for my (canon 20D) so i bought it for land scape shooting.. it works great, but one day i used it in a shiny day for a horse show, in the continues mode withe a high speed exposure the maximum u got is 3 continue shoots.. compair with ExtremeIII 6 shoots."
3,"Big, but not very fast","This card works fine, and yeah 4GB is huge. BUT, it's noticeably slower than my generic PNY 2GB card. When shooting JPGs continuously at 5FPS on my 30D, this card can only take about 10-15 frames before the framerate slows down. My 2GB card will do... 40!?"
3,title somewhat misleading,"When I bought it I expected a DVD about all kinds of shimmies and lots of drills but a lot of time is spent on other things too, so it is not a DVD about shimmies, strictly speaking. It is more an introduction to belly dance, including shimmies. Moreover shimmies don't seem to be this dancer's specialty. Instead of this DVD I recommend ""1001 shimmies"" by Leila Jouvana who is really a shimmy queen."
2,Not able to view entire DVD,"From what little I can watch of this DVD, I agree with the above viewers. That being said, I purchased this directly from the instructor, but this DVD skips and freezes on all of my DVD players so I've yet to be able to watch the entire DVD, so who knows?"
2,Kept waiting for the good part...,"Yeah...no. The back of the book was far more compelling than the actual novel. Some well-written scenes and occasionally a lovely sense of time and place, some well-crafted caricatures -- none of it is enough to rescue the self-concious, coming of age tone, despite the author's obvious attempt at something much more noble and searingly insightful. It's as if we get a lot more anatomically involved in ""Are You There, God, It's Me Margaret"" when what the author was shooting for was ""The Vagina Monologues."" The book is readable, but only if you've checked it out from the library."
1,Spend your money on another book,"I also read this book in college, more like 15 years ago for me. It was part of a Contemporary American Fiction course. Even then I found myself wondering if this was really the representative of the best than contemporary fiction could offer. If so, I was happy to stick with older works. While other reviewers remember lush scenes, I remember a sorid Hawaiian themed bar in NYC and the main character's rape with a plastic tiki. I can stomach rough scenes when they are purposeful. I found little of purpose in this story. I think there are far better uses for your book money than this book."
4,One annoying distraction,"I agree with the other readers, with one caveat: an annoying distraction for me while reading this otherwise excellent book was the author's chronic use of incorrect terminology when referring to female genitalia. There are at least 5 or 6 points in the book where she refers to a woman's vagina, when what she clearly means is vulva. It's just irritating when female writers, especially, don't know the parts of the female body."
4,Enjoyed this.,"I've been enjoying Italian mysteries lately. Zen is fun, especially since the stories are also now on PBS. Dibdin is a good writer."
3,Number 2 is better than Number 1,"I reviewed Ratking and had to say I wasn't keen on it, but decided to keep at this series and read the second book, Vendetta. It is somewhat better than Ratking. The female characters are still stick figures -- Didbin doesn't show that he has any insight into women with these novels. But he is pretty good at describing the strange world of Italian men of different classes and regions. The odd italicized storyline that allows us to see inside a particular character's mind is fairly well-done, but doesn't come across as a different voice. And Zen is still not a particularly likeable person: he is not very clear-thinking, suspicious, venal, and petty. His one positive characteristic is that he needs to solve puzzles and get at the truth of a crime. But he's not so faithful to the truth that he won't lie when it suits him. I'm still on the fence with this series, and may take a break."
2,Why not use the truth?,"What I don't understand about this book is how it and the Amazon reviewers of it can be so brainwashed by the adoption industry that they do not respect Sarah Saffian's natural parents as being such. The demeaning word ""birth mother"" is used not only throughout Sarah's book but also in reviews of it. In addition, Sarah seems to refuse to acknowledge her parents as what they really are: her parents. Sarah's lack of thinking for herself and her inability to understand and respect natural family relationships is sad indeed. May she one day take a few steps away from denial and from the adoption industry, which she obviously supports, and realize how terrible mother and child separation is. I'd like to read the book that she writes after she wakes up from her adoption fantasy."
4,A fresh voice explores familiar territory,"As an adoptee active in adoption politics, I don't like to spend my free time reading adoption books. Especially since so many of them focus on what I find to be nonsensical and ultimately destructive notions of primal wounds, adopted child syndrome, or whining about not feeling whole. This book didn't do that, and I found the story compelling, the writing polished, and the voice refreshing. Unlike another reviewer, I thought the author clearly articulated her belief that adoptees have a constitutional right to their records, and I appreciate and agree with this view.I think this is must reading for an adoptee or birthparent, either going through a search and find, or about to embark on one. My own caveat is that the book seemed to end unsatisfactorily for me. I felt like something was missing. I didn't need anything neat and tidy, but a little more retrospection would have been nice."
2,Puzzled By the All the Hoopla,"I finally picked up a copy of this book, which has been much-touted in the press and elsewhere, but I'm really not sure what all the enthusiasm is about. It seems to be yet another ""poor little rich girl gazing at her navel"" story, and the writing, while competent, is certainly unexceptional. I do appreciate the author's willingness to probe her psyche in some meaningul way, but the end result is a narrator whom I felt indifferent towards. Adoptees, in and of themselves, are not special people-- so why do we hunger for their stories?"
2,Here comes the judge,"Boo-hoo, a very rich girl by birth is adopted by a very rich family. This is a melodramatic book about a very real subject that could have been handled with great depth and sensitivity if the author hadn't been so self-absorbed and sophmoric that she couldn't understand her privelege. This is not to say, of course, that people of money can't be in turmoil or crisis, but to put forth a tone that makes this struggle the equal of people who are adopted into poverty-struck, drug-addled families (and yes I'm talking about white on white adoption here) is both disgusting and shallow. She has skills but veers into self-pity and martyrism much too easily. I hope she is young enough that she can learn to be a better person."
1,a good short story,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, adoption is not a part of my personal history. I found the author's intense focus on her thought process to be tedious. Perhaps if adoption were something that I have a strong connection to, I would have found her slow (and I mean SLOW) personal growth to be more compelling. I pretty quickly got the point that it took her a long time to feel ready to meet her birth parents, but she kept on saying it over and over and over...While reading some sections, I really wondered why the author ruined a very good short story/magazine article by turing it into a full length book."
3,"Good profile of intrusive, narcissistic birthparents","I have been amazed at the number of early reviewers who judged Ms. Saffian's wariness as cold or self-serving. Though the book IS too drawn-out, I found myself cringing along with the author at each letter from her birth father. His emotional effusiveness presumed an intimacy with her he did not in fact have; his whole tone was, as Saffian points out herself, repulsively self-dramatizing and solipsistic. Why do reviewers consider these the ""perfect"" birthparents? They come across as relentlessly self-centered in the pressure they put on the narrator, despite the lipservice they pay to patience. Perhaps all readers, adoptive and biological, can take a cue from this memoir; Saffian's twentysomething queasiness in the face of her birthparents' emotionalism and self-absorption is a GREAT example of how many, many gen-xers feel in the face of many, many baby boomers' self-dramatizing narcissism. The generation gap continues..."
1,boring little rich girl,"i had really high hopes for this when i started it, but was soon disappointed by the author's tiresome self-absorption. the writing is usually decent, except for the cringeworthy ""inside the womb"" section. sarah saffian is not a likable woman, sorry to say. i wish she was."
2,I'm a fellow adoptee and I can't relate to this book.,"I found this book to be drawn-out and the author's views to be slightly presumptuous. The recurring theme of pushing away the birth family gets old quickly, and the book takes on a whiny tone. Certain aspects are over-dramatized. After seeing Saffian at a book fair, I wanted to relate to this book, but found the author's focus on herself to be smothering and alienating. On the positive side, Saffian is successful in not jumping to one side of the fence or the other in the open/closed records debate. While she wasn't sure she wanted her birth parents to find her, she also seemed to be at peace with them by the end of the book."
1,Get over yourself...,"I'd have to agree with the reader/reviewer, linda from sarasota, fl. Though well-written, I find this author dreary, selfish and overly affected by her small life. As an adoptee, I've heard every story possible regarding meeting or attempting to meet birth parents. I'm disappointed that the author couldn't have portrayed a stronger, more sensitive and giving person through this ordeal. It's a shame that the story happened the way it did...what a wonderful reunion this could have been for all concerned. Instead, the author portrayed herself as a 'stalkee' and then had to emotionally beat herself up and everybody around her through the entire ordeal...and a ridiculous 3-year ordeal it was! I stuck with this book through the end because she didn't actually reveal the 'reunion' until close to the end; however, I was relieved to finish the book, so I could be done with poor Sarah's journey."
1,Save yourself the money,"This is a memoir written, like so many, by a complete narcissist. It should have stayed in the author's diary and not been made public. There are plenty of good books about adoption, but this isn't one of them."
2,Big Disappointment,"Being very interested in adoption, I had waited a long time for this book to be delivered. However, it turned out to be a big disappointment. As others have mentioned, I found it to be very well-written, but it did not give me any insight into what the writer was experiencing. Good books, in my opinion, are books which emotionally take hold of me. Make me cry,laugh,mad, sad etc. With this book, I could not help but be fustrated in how little it was able to do so. I was always left totally detached. Bottom line, over-rated."
4,Almost perfect,"Item arrived well packed and ahead of schedule. It is very pretty and is narrow enough to comfortably fit on a 7 year old girl's shoulder. Unfortunately, the ""c"" in ""Daisy Rock"" is missing. Not a big deal, but, it detracts from being the perfect accessory from Grandpa for my grandaughter's new pink guitar. This defect was clearly visible in the original factory package."
2,Not as good as the originals...,"I've owned several pairs of the original green Spenco insoles (Running/Walking), and have loved them. I run several times per week to train for my job and they have improved the cushioning of the already comfortable Asics Gel-Nimbus 11's. However, these new gel models are terrible for running. They offer barely more cushioning than the stock insoles on a normal basis such as standing or walking, but when you begin running they just squish into nothing. Even for standing around I still would buy the green ones."
4,Nice mats,Nice mats but the little hooks to keep it still are a little weak and make a hole in the oem carpet. Nice mats though.
2,VERY short version of Robin Hood.,The Robin Hood story on this DVD is only a few minutes long. The rest of the DVD contains old Warner Bros. cartoons.
5,Beautifully done.,"I'm a birth mother of a child in an open adoption, and I gave this book to my son's adoptive mother for Mother's Day. The black and white photographs are gorgeous, and they really sum up all the complex emotions inherent in adoptive relationships. The text for each story is well-written and illuminating, and the authors were obviously careful to represent the full range of adoption experiences. If you're looking for something special to express the lifelong connections between the adopted person and his or her birth and adoptive families, this is your book."
1,The cover photo says it all,"This wretchedly biased book is more firewood for the misinformation circulating about the 1909 hoax attempted by Brooklyn's own Fred Cook. Cook and his anti-Peary supporters have simply provided a convenient distraction for those opposed to accepting a Negro at the Pole! Yes, everyone knows Cook was a crook, but if only Peary had taken a white man with him...Oh, the cover is hilarious--from a New York photography studio series of publicity shots. The ""Eskimo"" girl, in another view, is obviously just another cute Irish babe, Cook's boots are from 5th Ave. The sledge dogs are Collies. Too hilarious. Way to go Cook!By the way, the content of this ""Made for TV"" series is on the same education par as those ""Loch Ness Monster"" specials from the History Channel. An actual polar history expert saw the film version and shared with me this eloquent summary: ""what garbage!"" Amen."
3,Standard Ultra II SD Card - cannot get full capacity with some devices,"As described, for some reason, I cannot get access to the full 2 GBs with my Casio Exilim EX-Z40. The camera does support a 2GB standard SD card, but I can only get 1GB of access with the Ultra II. Do not know why or how to remedy. Cannot tell any discernible speed difference,but that is probably just because of my camera."
1,Very Disappointing,"Bought this card for daughter's Canon Powershot A720, in Dec. 07. The first time she used it, it would only hold 20 pictures, then she got unidentified image message (even though the picture taken was briefly displayed. She tried reformating the card several times. Always the same message. This Dec. 2008, I tried it with my Canon Sx110. Same problem. would not buy again."
4,High Speed - Works for D50,"This is a great product if you want a fast memory card for Nikon D50 SLR.Works great and fast transfer. I bought A-Data 150X, but this one is faster than that!"
5,Great memory card!,This thing is incredible---we've been using the card for nearly a month now and I still have yet to download the pics onto the computer!!!
1,First disappointment from SanDisk...,It works fine in my camera (Nikon D40X) but my laptop (Presario V2000) card reader doesn't acknowledge it. Re-formatting in-camera it didn't help. It's not a card reader issue because other media works OK. No help yet from SanDisk tech support. I'll end up giving it to a friend in the hope she has better luck. Lesson learned: Always test new media end-to-end before commiting important images to it. I lost a few really good shots.
1,DEFECTIVE,"I bought this card and it arrived as an un opened new package. That was the end of the happy story. It was defective and it couldn't be read at all in any camera, PDA or memory card reader. Windows XP reported that it can't format this drive when tried to format it with FAT32/FAT or NTFS. Strangely enough it was read by Windows as a 4GB drive instead of a 2GB.Don't buy, it seems it is part of a defective bulk. I have the 1GB version and it works fine (at least until now!)."
4,Memory card,"There is not much to say about this item,if you have a memory card for a game console this is pretty much the same thing,and if you don't well this is an item to give you camera more memory."
5,Great media,i will never get near the capacity that this added to my camera. great. simple. fantastic price.
5,Always room for more photos and video clips,Always room for more video clilps and photos. Eliminates the need to carry around multiple memory sticks.
4,Great SD Card,To be honest this is the only type of SD card I've ever used. This was the second one I've purchased. Like my other one it works quickly and I've never had any problems with it.
5,Great Deal,This SD Memory card was a steal. Lots of storage and a fantastic price. I highly recommend this product.
5,Works Great and Delivered Quickly,"There isn't a lot to say, but the card works great and was delivered quickly. I decided just before a trip that I needed more than 1 GB in my underwater camera for several dive trips and had this card delivered to my hotel - it was waiting when I arrived and I used it to take dive photos the next day! I did actually use it in my Canon camera, but I would imagine it would work in most cameras."
1,This card has PROBLEM,"I have a kodak Z760 and after one mons of use I have founded a lot of problem, some date this card function very well some date no. Sometime I've had corrupt files in my camera. I don't recomend this card for use in a Kodak Z760."
1,sanDisk SD ultra II 512,"Causing problems since the first day. Additionally I even needed to byu a photo recovery software. Now I have a ""bad track 0"", so I can not format it. Useless!!!!"
1,AMAZON IS A RIP OFF ORGINIZATION,I was extremely disapointed in AMAZON. I ordered a Ultra II San disk with a 2 gig memory capacity and they shipped me a Ultra II San Disk with a 1 gig memory capacity in the 2 gig package.Thanks for ripping me off............
1,useless,I purchased the SanDisk Ultra II Secure Digital Card to use in my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8 camera because it was supposed to be much better than a regular SD card. Much faster transfer speed than standard card.It is incompatible with this camera. I also couldn't get either my home pc or laptop to format the card. SanDisk techinical support basically said that they were sorry. Too bad! Nothing we can do about it.Avoid the SanDisk 2GB Ultra II Secure Digital Card if you have a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8 camera.
1,Lock Problem,"I give this SD card a 1-star. Why? when I attempt to insert it into my laptop SD card reader, the mere act of this insertion causes the lock to switch to the engaged position, making it unreadable. The same happens on occasion in my Canon SD1000. Why would you put a locking mechanism on the device which would slide shut when inserting the card? Idiotic. It should be the other way around. Other than that, the card performed without incident. But this is a serious flaw."
5,Great Stuff! and Great Service!!!,I bought two of SanDisk SDSDH-2048-901 2 GB Ultra II for my recent trip to France. They were great. I would highly recommend this product.
5,lotsa pictures,"I picked this up so as not to have to buy a second or third card when I go on trips. That and my girlfriend LOVES to take pictures of EveryThing! At 7 mp(size) I can take about 1,000 pictures, at 5mp I can take about 1,300... so it works out very well for me. easy to use and definitely worth it."
5,Great capacity and speed,"I use this SD card with my Canon Powershot SD 750 and I can store almost 1,000 photos at the ""fine"" setting. It drops to around 650 if you choose ""super fine"". The speed of the card is good as well. When you shoot in continuous mode (hold down the shutter button and it keeps taking pictures) there is just a minor delay between pictures. I'm guessing maybe .5 seconds in between shots when the flash isn't involved."
1,This card has problems,"I have used Sandisk Ultra 1GB card for my Canon S2 IS camera earlier, but needed more space. Inspite of some poor ratings, I bought the Sandisk Ultra 2GB (and not the 2GB Extreme which I was planning to). Though I CAN view all the photos I copied from the camera to my PC, Ringo Uploader won't upload all of them, there are some (around 50%) ""BAD FILES"", which means I'll have to upload them manually. Yeah, manually uploading works, so the software that verifies whether the file is okay, is giving the error. Bottomline is: this card does not work as seamless as the 1GB Ultra card. I will not recommend this product. Try other cards out there."
1,Horror for me,"I had over two hundred images to download and Poof, all pixelated...I am so upset..once in a life time shots and all screwed up. I would NOT recommend this card"
2,san disk memory card does not work with OS10,Be careful when you buy this memory card. It does not work with Mac OS10. I hope I can return the one I have not opened
4,SD cards,"scan disks are great. i just purchesed a nikon d60, and was wondering though if these SD ultras 2GB and 4GB will work for the d60?"
4,This card is excellent,"This card works well in my exilim (Casio Exilim Z750) camera and it is capable of taking over 800 pictures or a few minutes of action.If you have a high megapixel camera, then I would recommend you get the ultra SD card because you will be able to use all of the functions of these camreas with the card."
5,Blazing Speed !,"I could only realize 1.8 GB with this card but its worth it.Camera videos can be huge in size-this is ideal for storing them.In sports mode my camera takes in like 2 pics in 3 secs-thanks to this card to let my camera realize its true speed.Looks cool, and professional and there are no worries to think about your memory space once you have this."
2,I hate this card!,"I bought this card because I only had two smaller cards for my camera - a Canon card and a Kodak card. Everytime I put those cards into my reader, it reads them on the first try. This one I have to remove and reinsert 6-15 times every time I want to download my photos! It's a SanDisk reader. I contacted them and they're suppsed to replace it, but their customer service sucks. I'm thinking about returning it and trying a different brand."
4,perfect,used it with my Nikon D80 and works perfectly. I copied the photos from the camera and as it supports USB 2.0 it copies very fast.If using from a card reader you have to make sure your card reader supports 2GB cards.
2,D-Fective,"Do NOT get this model. Look at the reviews...plenty of errors with this card, lots of lost data. I can't get it to retain data without errors. Instead, get the SanDisk Ultra III 2GB card, which is the perfected version. SanDisk is a good producer of memory cards, but you should only get their top-of-the-line Ultra III cards."
3,Good but you probably can go a little less expensive,"I bought this for my Cannon A630 point and shoot automatic camera.I can't tell much if any speed difference between this and the less expensive Sandisk standard SD card.Search for:2GB SanDisk Secure Digital SD Memory Card 2 GB (Bulk)And save about ten bucks as far as I see.Love the camera and I use it every day. No problem at all with the card, and the purchase process was flawless. Use lithium batteries, which last a LOT longer!!!"
2,Wrong one in package,"Be careful, I ordered the 2GB, but then got a 1GB. I returned this item and instead I ordered 2 1GB ones."
4,Funny Thing,This item when originaly shipped was a 1 gb disk in a 2 gb package. SO just be weary of the packaging. Other than that it is worth the price and works great!
4,"Sandisks cost more, but are worth it.","I have come to rely on Sandisk branded (Ultra and Extreme) flash cards. I have some very old Sandisk flash cards that I have been using for years and are still working fine. It's for this reason why for anything critical, I would stick with using Sandisk. For this particular purchase, I started using this in digital cameras, but as capacities grew, I ended up putting this in an electronic dictionary. That was a few years ago and it still works fine.Given most of these flash cards use MLC, I tend to fill the flash cards to capacity before I delete or format the cards, which would make these cards last longer (by reducing the number of write cycles)."
5,A clear guide....,"This was a required text for a counseling class I'm taking. I find this book to be very informative and interesting. Although this book is geared toward Christian counsleors, it is also applicable to non-Christians - or if you're just looking for ways to improve your marriage. This book is not written at all like a textbook. It's very straight-forward and easy to read. Very little technical language is used, and even that is clearly explained.I believe that this book is very, very good. It's giving me a clearer idea of how to counsel and what a counselor's main objectives are. I recommend this book to anybody interested in counseling, and even those who are already professional counselors. This book is applicable to Christians and non-Christians alike."
3,Bought because I had to for class,"I only bought this book because it was required reading for a class. I've only gotten a few chapters into it, but it seems pretty repetitive, a lot of the information is sort of common sense or really general stuff, and overall, I wouldn't read it if I didn't have to for a grade."
3,Caution: they may have changed the label...,"I ordered a bag of this s*** (ha ha ha) and post order was contacted by the seller. It seems that SUNLEAVES decided to change the composition note (N-K-P) to one of nearly half of the advertised one. What does this mean? It means that your getting half the nutrients that are advertised here. The stuff still works, I just wish it was the super potent crap that is advertised."
4,"Good ""old timey"" entertainment","I have been pleased with this product. Quality of conversion to dvd is good. Be aware that the story lines reflect the time period in which they are made. (Some of the shows have a very ""50's"" attitude toward women and their place in society.) Has sparked some very interesting conversation with my two modern teenage girls!"
4,Oldies but goodies!,Old shows are the best. I enjoy the oldies and old family shows are one of my favorites. Need to have more of this kind of TV available for Kindle.
5,"Donna Reed, 'One' of the Best","Who would have thought, one day, we'd be able to watch TV shows we grew up with? Anytime we felt like relaxing, sitting back, at our own leisure?Donna Reed, Season 1, brought back many memories. I would have loved living in that era, especially if life was similar to the Stones. (Not getting stoned, like most of today's programs.) Nice but modest home, happy, intelligent children, food on the table, and a mother who'd listen and help resolve our problems.For those who enjoy watching Good-Old TV shows, I recommend Donna Reed, Season 1.I can't wait until the complete series is available."
5,Life sure has changed,"Loved both seasons of this show. Cannot wait for my order of the third season to arrive.Why did people and life change so much? This is a wonderful way for me to have a look at how my parents grew up. Donna Reed is so beautiful and the show has funny, loving, caring story lines.The only negative thing I can say is the phone at the beginning of each show. After watching the entire season in one sitting I hear the phonel in my sleep. LOL.. I really like the Amazon unbox feature. Too bad more shows are not available on it. Great show. Many lessons taught in a loving, humorous sensitive way."
5,The Donna Reed Show: The Complete First Season,"Great, once again I love the innocence of shows like this. I strive to be a decent person, like the characters on these shows. They do teach us."
2,Not like I remembered,"I rented this on net flix to share with my daughter and to preview it before purchasing. I remember watching it as a child. Now, watching again from an adult perspective, I am shocked at how manipulative Donna is. In one episode on the first disc, She goes behind her husband's back, cons his friend into pleading guilty to an unjust traffic citation instead of fighting it, just so the family can go camping. In the end, she gets her way, and her husband thanks her for watching out for him and gives her a kiss. Excuse me?? My husband would be livid, and rightly so! She is always there, ready to conquer any situation and set everything to right, no matter the cost as she puts on a smile and ever so sweetly puts the man in his place. Not a role model I would want my daughter to follow."
5,Excellent show -- give us more!!,"Others have already described how entertaining The Donna Reed Show is and how enjoyable the four principal cast members are, and I couldn't agree more.Here's hoping that they issue the remaining seasons in short order!!"
3,Warm and Fuzzy -- too Fuzzy,"A great show but the picture quality of this DVD set is only mediocre -- compared to the crisp video of ""Leave It to Beaver,"" ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""Perry Mason"" on DVD, it looks like a blurry VHS tape. Disapppointing if you are planning to watch on your 50-inch plasma."
4,A TV Classic from the golden era!,"Great to see this show released. Always a favorite in our household when I was a youngster. My only criticism is, for the price there are virtually NO extras, aside for one network promo and some still photos."
5,a music fan,"If you ain't no real ugk fan, don't get it. Tightest album since Ridin Dirty. Once again, Dirty South prevails."
2,Too Much Static,"We are looking to return this to Target. It has way too much static, enough to make it hard to hear Nicolas when he first starts to wake up.Other review comments also seem to be accurate:- lights are very bright- touching or moving the unit when on produces loud cracking sound- picks up all kinds of electrical ""noise""Check the other ratings at Amazon, this is one of the worst rated. Look for something else."
1,Terrible-I had 2..,"I bought 2 sets of these monitors because I wanted one in my 2 year olds room-he just moved to a twin bed, and I wanted one in the babies room. I stupidly took them both out the box before the baby was born, I set them up-the one in my oldests room worked great for what I needed it for...for 2 weeks! Then it just stopped working-i thought it was just a fluke and at the point he was used to being in his big boy bed so I didnt bother getting another monitor-or using the other one. The other monitor had so much static i wanted to throw it out the window. I used it for 4 nights, then went and bought a sony baby call. The extra money is worth it. These monitors where terrible and i had to eat the money unfoutunitly for me. I should have read the reviews before I bought these"
4,ok monitor,"I picked this up as an inexpensive replacement for an old monitor that my toddler broke the ac adaptor on. A replacement adaptor was going to cost more than a new monitor, so...The static isn't too bad for us - not any worse than the last monitor. Range is good. This is a good basic baby monitor and works for us.HERE'S A TIP ABOUT STATIC FOR ANY BABY MONITOR - another appliance plugged into the same current can cause static, even if that appliance isn't running. That means ANY plug connected in the same line, such as all the outlets in a bathroom, all outlets in a kitchen, all those in a bedroom, etc. With my old monitor, for example, if we had it plugged into the same line as our cell phone adaptor across the room, there was HORRENDOUS static. (Ironically it was clearest if you wre running the toaster on the same current.) My electrical engineering hubby had to explain it to me!"
2,Won't let you sleep,This monitor is so bad it won't let you sleep at night. The static is horrible and I have to put my ear on the receiver to see if it was my son crying or just static.
2,Get the SONY BABYCALL monitor instead!,"The Sony is far superior. The only thing I liked better about the Fisher Price is that the lights are more sensitive on the F-P model. In every other aspect, the Sony rocks!The F-P picked up an AM radio station in my apt complex, along with a lot of static if not placed in exactly the right spot..."
1,Don't bother,"As the others have said...don't even bother with this monitor. We used it for almost 2 weeks, and had to return it. It was awful...so much static...and it ate batteries like crazy."
4,Very sensitive monitor,"This monitor was initially indispensable in caring for our twins. The default channel had too much static to use, but once we switched over to the 'B' setting, that stopped being a problem. I can hear everything through the monitor, even being able to distinguish between my two children breathing. I love the option to turn off the sound and see whether the babies are noisy - one of my girls HATED bedtime until she was a few months old, and this allowed us to let us see whether she was still crying after 5 minutes without having to go in the room or listen to the I-hate-bedtime screaming. After nine months of daily use, the receiver stopped working, but this is decent value for the price. I found that the Safety First monitor I bought picked up the sounds from this one's base, but with increased sensitivity. It would have been nice if the nightlight could be turned on without the monitor relaying sound, but the option to turn the nightlight off is fine."
3,receivers are top heavy,"The monitor works fine. There's no problem with static, and it picks up the smallest noises. For it's purpose it's sufficient.The big complaint I have is the receivers are top heavy. They constantly tip over. If you have the receiver in a high traffic area like ours which is on our kitchen counter, it falls over multiple times each day. Usually we just leave it. How hard would it have been to design a wide and/or heavier base for the receiver?This is a cheap product that gets the job done, just barely."
2,Broke after 6 months...,This item worked fine for 6 months and then the reciever died while we were on vacation - just started snapping rather than broadcasting the baby. Tried to contact Fisher-Price via the web to report problem but they've designed the site so that you loose interest and only provide phone numbers.Cheap price = cheap item. If you only need for the Newborn stage than maybe.....
1,"terrible, terrible should i add terrible",Worst baby monitor ever. Does not work across a house. Static is horrendous.Stay away.
2,waste of my money,"After 7 long months I finally got custody of my niece. So we decided we needed a monitor since her room is on the other end of my house. It has a lot of static and I keep hearing a lot of ""banging"". At first I thought it was the baby making noises but when I went in to check on her she was sound asleep. I absolutely hate this monitor. The only thing going for it is that it picks up the baby sounds well."
4,Decent Monitor For Price,"I love this system. However, after only 3 months of use the receiver decided to start cutting in and out. I did call Fisher Price and they are sending a replacement. I don't see the use in spending loads of money on an expensive one though. I love the way you can ""see the sound"" while it's turned down. I would still recommend this to a friend."
2,Bad Quality...,"We bought this monitor about a year ago to replace the one we had gotten at a yard sale and it seemed to work great at first, however after about 2 months the 1st receiver, (it came with two), just suddenly stoped working! I thought maybe one of our family members got water on it or something because it was kept in the kitchen, but sure enough a few months later the other receiver that we kept in our bedroom just suddenly stoped working! There must be some kind of defect in the production of these things because as I can see from reading the other reviews that we're not the only family having problems. Save yourself the headache and purchase a different brand/model."
3,"Sounds ""N Lights 'N noise","We're on our third child, so I wasn't going to blow lots of money on a monitorthis one works fine, but there is a lot of static and other noise. All in allit does what it is supposed to, but is a little annoying."
1,horrible...,all i could hear was the local am radio station -- and even that wasnt clear... spend some more money and get something better...
5,Robust at 6 years old,"We've had our monitor for only 18 months, but it's second hand and built in 2005, and still going strong. Provides a nice night light in the room too."
5,Best ever printer,This Hp photosmart C5140 all in one is the best printer i have every bought and believe me i have been thur alot of printers but this one is the best it does everything i need it too do if you get a chance too check one out i would not pass it up you will not be disapointed.
1,why did i buy this,"yes why did i buy this, i was thinking this was wireless, but nope just network ready, all hype on the box. even the $100 optional wireless still does not make it a wireless printer,, stay away..it is an all in one printer, haha but no fax. what are they thinking.lexmark here i come, will save $150 too."
3,Exposing the underbelly of the dragon....,"Linda Frost's work is painful to read, and yet is something that needs to be told. In spite of several redundancies in the text, a worthwhile read...."
5,Trouble with trolls,"Great ""Scandinavian"" book for a Norwegian like me to share with my children.My daughter loves all of Jan Brett's books."
5,A fun read,"A little girl named Treva tells her story wen she had trouble with trolls. She lives on the slopes of Mount Baldy and was hiking it to visit her cousin who lives on the other side. With her is her dog Tuffi. Trouble happens along the way as a troll will jump out and declare ""I want dog""She tricks them into taking pieces of her clothing but eventually she reaches the top and discovers they still want the dog. She declares she can fly with her skies but needs all her cloths back. She asks for a push but they can't since they are holding Tuffi. She offers to hold the dog and away she skis to the cries of ""Dog, Dog, Dog!""This is a fun little story and my little girl has taken to it. Probably because the artwork is very good!There is also a small side story of a hedgehog who wanders into the home of the trolls.This is a sweet well written and drawn story that will make for any child's bedtime reading. Be prepared to hand over the book so the pictures may be viewed."
2,sizing not accurate,"per description: 3 inch x 10 inch decal - it's more like 2.5 inch x 7 inch decal, so kinda disappointed to spend $9 on this decal. It is a very pretty decal, just wish the size was as advertised"
1,Sizing way way off,Decal is fine but the sizing is so far off. It's only about 7 inches wide. I bought it to cover a scratch on the back of my car and wasted the money. I need to re-buy another one.
4,Complices,"I thought this CD was good. I especially liked the fact that Martin Ricca sung in this CD. I am a fan of Daniela Lujan, but I think that Belinda could sing much better, so i would've preferred that the songs be sung by her. The songs that i like are ""Locos De Amor"", ""Es Tiempo De Amar"", and ""Ven Conmigo""."
4,Great CD set from a legend!,"Back in the USA contains a great set list of one of the most influential rock stars of the past 50 years. Paul McCartney and his band perform many of the Beatles songs to perfection. If you like the Beatles, you will enjoy this CD set immensely!Quick Tip:This is strictly my opinion, but if you want to buy the DVD version of ""Back in the USA"" you should know that this is unfortunately one of the most poorly edited concert DVDs that I have ever seen. An otherwise stellar performance is ruined by WAY too many childish camera cuts of busty audience babes bounging up and down to the music and teary eyed beer-bellied middle aged men ""lip syncing"".....Okay, a few camera cuts of the busty audience babes is okay ;)But the teary eyed, lip syncing fat guys have got to go!(see the reviews on Amazon)"
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"Back In The U.S. is better than 1990's Tripping The Live Fantasic but not quite as good as 1976's Wings Over America. Paul pulls offsome impressive vocal acrobatics in ""My Love"" and a couple of othersongs. It lacks live monologue by Paul, though. Enjoyable listening."
3,STERILE,"Paul can still rock and his band are hot,but listening to this cd is like listening to a studio recording with applause added inbecause they have seen fit to edit out any of the chatter between songs,so this concert seems to have no atmosphere,also i find the sound of the recording very harsh and with no warmth to it.The definitive live Mccartney has yet to released and if he leaves it another 10 years it will never happen."
5,This is the best live CD ever possible,"Paul McCartney's live performance on these two discs is astounding. He performs almost all the songs energetically, and with feeling. However, the last four or five tracks on disc one seem a bit weak, especially ""Carry That Weight,"" and ""The Fool on the Hill."" The sound quality is excellent, much better than the live tracks on The Beatles' Anthology albums. The accompanying booklet is full of photographs from the tour, and there is a little message from each of the five band members. This is by far one of, if not the best, live albums ever released."
5,Very good live album,"Paul McCartney has every right to put his name first in the songwriting credits. Based on the book ""Beatlesongs,"" by William J. Dowdling, of the 19 Lennon/McCartney songs on this album, 13 of them were written by Paul alone, with NO help from John. So therefore, John's name really shouldn't be on many of those at all. (By the way, ""Beatlesongs"" is a great book, showing you the true authorship of each song, in percents.). And he plays the songs very well live, too. The sound quality on these recordings is a lot better than the live tracks on the Beatles Anthology albums, and miles better than on the CD ""Last Night in Hamburg."" The only song he sort of messes up is ""Something,"" on which he plays something that sounds like a ukelele or a banjo. He sings it faster and more upbeat than the recording on ""Abbey Road."" Other than that, it's a good album, and Yoko should find something important to worry about instead of fussing over John's name being second."
5,McCartney's Fans: Buy this album!...,"Paul McCartney continues his post-millennial return to form with this sizzling double disc!The stripped-down arrangements work quite well (Remember, the Beatles were a four-piece!). The tunes featuring just Paul and his keyboard are especially enjoyable. As usual, Paul is in fine voice throughout.A bonus for McCartney fans is a version of the rare ""Vanilla Sky"" from the movie of the same name.This album is a must for McCartney fans!"
2,Another one Paul??,"Paul is great live,, no doubt about that. But in the last ten tears, we have the 'unplugged', 'tripping', 'paul is live' and now 'back in the us'. This is probably a Guiness record! I'd say about 80% of the tracks on this album have already been released in a live version in the last decade, so I am taking out a star because of that. This item is more like a concert memorabilia, like a t-shirt or a cup, but nothing really worth to listen more than once, unless you attended the concerts. For me, 'tripping the live fantastic' is superior and more much interesting."
3,Turning into Elvis,"OK, I bought it after I saw the TV special in a weak nostagic moment. Then after listening I realized, I own all these songs already sung by a much younger meat-eating Paul. Meat = better Vocals!!How many compilation and live albums has he released the last 10 years? Just like Elvis in the 70s. I should have bought the Elvis album...oh well."
3,"Great Concert , Bad Recording","While the concert was amazing and Paul still definitely has it, this recording is not very good. Some songs sound better than others but in general they sound very muffled. It shouldn't stop you from getting it, just keep this in mind."
3,hard to enjoy,"As a longtime loyal and serious Beatles fan, I have every release by the Beatles and as solo artists. I've attended all of the McCartney shows that have been in my area and even ventured on a Pilgrimage to Liverpool. While this CD (and the DVD) of these performances is entertaining, I can't enjoy them. Sir Paul's media over exposure, self promotion, and most recently his desire to change song credits to McCartney/Lennon has ruined my listening/viewing experience. He seems to preferrefering to his famous past as ""in the sixties"" rather than mention the Beatles. Listening to the CD and viewing the DVD after this may begin to bother you too."
3,Not Quite Live Enough,"Though the recording is a document of his tour, it's lacking those moments that make it a truly ""live"" experience on disc; the song introductions, band banter between numbers, and--most critically--interaction with the audience. While the performances themselves are outstanding and stand above some found on, say, ""Paul Is Live!"" or ""Tripping the Live Fantastic"", I miss the essential Macca wit. Perhaps it was a necessary edit to fit all the great songs onto two discs. The liner notes are bit thin as well. The booklet doesn't state where the performances were recorded. It was nice of Paul to give his band space to express their thoughts, though. In the end I'd love to see Paul do a live box set. He's always loved the concert element and is a dynamic performer. 3-1/2 stars really."
5,All his loving,"I have my doubts before I bought it, because I thought ""Just another McCartney live album"", but when I heard it, I was shocked, the guy keeps singing and playing like no one else in the whole world can. All the songs are great, but I like the versions of LET ME ROLL IT, ALL MY LOVING, GETTING BETTER and MOTHER NATURE'S SON specially. I sincerly recomend it to the fans, and those who are not should buy it too.Greetings from Uruguay."
4,Excellent,"Great performances of classic songs. Paul can still rock! His voice is amazing for a 60 year old man, and this new band has energized him.Would have liked some between song banter, and that's the only thing preventing a five star rating.Go get 'em Paul!! Your amazing."
5,SWWWWWEEEETTTT,i reviewed it 1st yes!!! its a awesome cd paul is great he re-does the old beatles songs perfectly and this is one kicking live cd probably the best live cd other that the eagles's hell freezes over!!! add this cd to your collection
2,"Paul is dead, miss him, miss him....","After two strong live albums in the past ten years (""Tripping the Live Fantastic"" and ""Paul is Live""), this one -- sadly -- falls under the weight of itself. Gone is the joy, spririt and well-orchestrated sponteniety of those projects; in its place is production that muddles too many of the songs throughout and the set list bounces around too much and never gets a good footing. ""Macca"" has merely ground-out another ""McLive"" album which mixes many of the ""classics"" of his Beatles, Wings and solo years along with the requisite three songs from the album he was touring behind in the spring of 2002. Better he'd dropped those and included some cuts from his ""Flaming Pie"" set from 1997 (""Young Boy"", ""If You Wanna"", for instance) or the back-to-the-future ""Run Devil Run"" from 1999. Then again, maybe the CD is beset by ""instant karma"" -- after all, all the Beatles songs sounded better when credited to ""Lennon/McCartney""..."
5,Macca still rocks,"Any of you Fab Four freaks will love this latest CD. Thank god he included his tribute to John Lennon, ""Here Today."" BEAUTIFUL. Anyone who was lucky enough to attend any of the ""Back in the U.S. 2002"" concerts will be glad to have this to play (again and again and again). His tour group was about the best you will ever hear. I loved everything about the show, and this CD is a MUST for all of us who love Macca. Thank goodness he is well and hopefully happy now. Keep on rockin!"
4,perfect but pricey,"Got the cd fast, and in perfect condition. But was pricey since i think its out of print. But didnt mind since my payed me back for it. This cd set brings back memories of the awesome PaMccartney We was in 2002. The Paul Mccartney 2009 New York city is awesome too. Plus Its.still in print and comes for leas sigue2 cds and a dvd of the show to open Citi Bank field"
5,"Raw when required , gentle also , what a catalogue !","This live CD is a stunner . Fine sound and a great showcase for a versatile band . There will always be songs you wish had been included but these will do just fine . I don't think the world needs another live version of Hey Jude , but you can't help singing along regardless .Paul is in good voice . This collection is nearly as good as Van Morrison's IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP NOW or Tim Buckley's DREAM LETTER live albums .Very good indeed .For more live Paul with a mellower vibe , try the MTV UNPLUGGED cd . He plays a few Beatles tunes not on this live set ."
5,Paul is the Greatest!,"I was very excited when I saw they were putting this concert out in cd form (and now video)! I got tickets to his concert in Tacoma for my birthday, and as far as I am concerned it was the best b-day present EVER!! This cd is almost like being at the concert all over again. As I listen to each song I close my eyes and can imagine myself back in the Tacomadome with Paul up on stage in his little red shirt and black trousers putting on the greatest concert ever. Although I do wish that they put in the little bits Paul would say about some of his songs, and the bits about John and George, that would have been nice. I don't think, however, that it detracts from the main focus of the album, that being Paul's great music. (I would like to hear more massage stories though!!)"
2,I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT!,I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT THE ONLY SONG I LIKE WAS FREEDOM IT WAS A GREAT SONG PAUL COULD HAVE DONE BETTER I DIDN'T LIKE HIS VERSION OF SOMETHING I LIKE GEORGE HARRSION VERSION BETTER!FROM KIRSTEN
1,Deja Vu All Over Again,"All the Sir-Paul-ers (who can't refer to McCartney without appending the title), or, for the matter, the Sir-Mick-ers, the Sir-Elton-ers, and the Sir-Bob-ers, should bear in mind that David Bowie TURNED DOWN his knighthood. Let's hope John Lennon would have too (remembering that he returned his O.B.E, Order of the British Empire, medal as a Beatle).That, of course, has nothing to do with the recording in question, but, really, what's the point of reviewing it even? This is the zillionth or so time McCartney has released a live album including these same songs. McCartney zombies will buy anything McCartney releases (and believe anything McCartney says), then come back here and give it five stars. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...."
1,Wake up people.,Want to know what happens to talented ego-maniacs when they get old and their talent disappears? Then listen to this crud.
1,Back in the U.S.,Don't waste your money on this. Paul sounds like a 10 year old. The song Fool on a hill that would be Paul. I got my money back. I would give it no stars if i could.
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"The song selection is oh-so-obvious, and Paul's vocals are often remarkably sloppy and strained. The only ""notable"" thing about this CD is the ""McCartney/Lennon"" songwriting credits, and I don't mean that in a good way. It seemed Paul couldn't sink any lower after the embarrassment of his last studio effort, but now he has. Hard to believe this CD is outselling George Harrison's lovely BRAINWASHED..."
2,Relying on Past Glories,"Whilst this CD is by Paul McCartney (and friends) it seems that he has fallen into the trap of relying heavily on Beatle songs. Surely Paul can come up with something original after all this time. I also feel that his voice is not up to previous offerings but I appreciate that singing 'live' can place stress on the voice and that fans may want him to include such songs 'live'.Overall a pleasant CD, especially if you attended one of the shows, but not worth rushing out to buy, especially if you have the original tracks. One for Beatle fans only, in my opinion."
5,CD Review,"Since the item was a Christmas gift for my mom, I expected it and wanted it to come quickly which it did. She loves listening to the CD in her car all the time."
5,2nd Best Live Album Of His Solo Career,Nothing beats Wings Over America - nothing. But this album has a great set list and nice feel. The young band he put together for this tour SMOKES the old tried true and tested veterans that he's used since Wings broke up.
4,safe to an unusual degree?,"A search recently of Cosmeticsdatabase (if they can be believed; but they do seem diligent) seems to list this product or a similar product as being one of the rare products that is ""Low Hazard"": the listing at that dot-com is:""Curel Daily Moisture Therapy Lotion, Fragrance Free"";also ""Curel Lotion Ultra Healing"".(You too can go there and do the search.)In contrast, various other skin lotions being sold on Amazon are listed in Cosmeticsdatabase as ""Moderate Hazard"" or even ""High Hazard""."
5,STARDOM BY TAYLOR & FRANCIS,"Awesome book and story.Keep up the great team work.Would Love to read this in paper back, looking forward to doing so."
2,Metal corrodes easily.,This is the old metal version of the panel. I have soft water and the metal corrodes or gets all junked up. The plastic version (from Home Depot etc) seems to last longer.
5,Nice,"As everyone else has written, this seems well made, packs into its own pouch, and has already saved my hide from a sudden downpour. The underarm grommets are a nice touch for breathability.The only way I can think to improve it would be to include an elastic belt, like the french K-Ways, to carry it around."
5,Great jacket!,I bought the jacket to wear running since I lost my veryfavorite running jacket (that I had for about 7 years!). I am really pleased and happy with this purchase. Thejacket is roomy colorful and perfect for even rainy days!
2,Lacks breathability.,"I'd been searching for a sturdy, hooded, pullover windbreaker with a kangaroo pocket since Jan 2008. April 2011 I finally found this one. It's soooo close to perfect that it pains me to say that I can't recommend it because it doesn't breathe *at all*. It makes me sweat more than I normally would because it doesn't breathe and it leaves me and my clothes wet after even short bicycle rides. If the manufacturer changed the material to one that breathes it would be perfect. But as is, it's very unpleasant. The hunt remains on....."
5,Must have!,This jacket comes in two days via fedex and it is perfect. I wear it most of the day at work because my office is usually freezing. I have three of these in different colors! I recommend this to anyone needing a jacket for rain or indoors.
5,Perfect Anorack,"Lightweight, good construction and it is ""quiet,"" ie the material does not make a lot of rustling noise with movement. Good as a windbreaker and lightweight jacket."
3,It's Larger and Thinner than Expected,"I am a petite 5.3, I ordered a small which is my usual clothes size. The jacket swallowed me up, and the arm was a bit long. (When I showed someone my new jacket, the first comment I heard was, ""is that supposed to be your size?""). I should have ordered an extra-small, but the size chart noted that I should order a small. Anyway, unless you plan to wear a super-bulky sweater or fleece under you rain jacket, order one size smaller. I plan to wear mine for an upcoming travel, where the weather will be mild or hot. i don't want the roomy size. Also, the jacket is thinner than an older foldable rain jacket that we have. I hope this one will last."
5,"Cynical, but Informative","Medicine for Beginners is a historical approach rather than an aesthetic approach. It covers from whence medicine was for the shamans and healers and witch doctors. Soon, it became a practice and then a teaching and schooling. The author, although not cynical of the medicine itself, has some animosity against the trade which has become a biollion dollar a year business. Doctors has made it difficult to become a doctor (to raise prices) and insurance (to treat the rich). Since then, medicine has been really geared for those that do have money, and everyone else to pay the rest of their lives in fees (somewhat similar to the IRS and credit corps. do). Nonetheless it was a fun and easy book to read, one should not have any trouble tackling this book within a day. Out of print, it may serve as a good reference book to anyone who is reseaching medical history, but it may be somewhat out of the way as its not at the fingertips of everyone."
3,Good deal,"Too much reality or pessimistic ""truths"" is not what people want. Well that's Mr. Haneke for you. If you like his films, this is a good deal. But if you don't want to be depressed.......stay away."
