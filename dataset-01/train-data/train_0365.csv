3,"Nice size, chip easily","I ordered these bowls for snacks at a preschool where I cook. They are just the right size, but chip very easily in small, hard to see splinters."
5,Necessary for everyone,"I remember growing up using these little dishes in the kitchen. They are a tremendous help for pretty much anything you do, especially in the kitchen. When cooking they easily hold raw food or cooked food, can go in the microwave, are sturdy and are just plain great!"
5,Very nice,Everything I expected from Pyrex. They are clear and a nice size for what we use them for. super duper
2,Not happy with my purchase,It's suppose to be set of 4 and I only got 3. I was very disappointed when I opened the box. I thought they would have covers too but they didn't. I would not reccomend this product.
1,Look elsewhere,Seriously? 4 cups for $9? I just bought some (Pyrex) at the grocery store for $6 w/$1 coupon. Will use them for cupping coffee and lots of other stuff.
1,Was available for 4.99$,I bought this last dec from amazon for 4.99. Why are they selling this for 29.99. I believe this is a mistake. Anyways who would pay 8$ for simple glass custard bowl.
3,Color and thickness,Lovely little cups. I wish it's little thinner and the color is clear. This blueish color makes it look cheap...
3,Pyrex small cups for prep or infant feeding,delivered on time and intact. Design very old fashioned. I've seen more elegant glass cups and thought from photo that these cups had streamlined form. But they are very useful; can heat many separate items for eight months old granddaughter to eat and enjoy.
5,Versatile bowls!,"When some of my original (circa 1950) Pyrex custard bowls were lost or broken, I felt I couldn't live without them. I found these and was delighted. When they arrived I realized they are even sturdier than the last ones. I use them everyday for individual portions for my 2 year old grandson, for prep work, and for storing small leftovers. An absolute necessity in the kitchen for me!"
5,Oldies but goodies...,"I grew up with and now own 2 sets of these custard cups & am back for more. Growing up -- these bowls were literally staples for our family. My mother used them for single servings of jello, pudding, yogurt, etc when we were growing up. I lived without a set of my own for far too long. I didnt realize what I was missing until I finally found some & brough them home. I have 4 kids and they are perfect! Of course, they are glass -- so I am prepared to lose a few :)"
5,Perfect little kitchen helper,"I bought a dozen of these from another retailer (at half price) and I love them! They are perfect for everything that requires a small size container. I use the cups to beat two eggs, melt butter, heat up baby food (never heat food in any plastic), to serve ketchup or other condiments, store a small amount of leftovers, etc. By using the appropriately sized cup, I save a lot of space in both the fridge and the dishwasher. I recommend these highly."
5,"great value, lots of use",i bought 2 sets of these for myself and 1 set for a friend. they're great quality and helpful in the kitchen for spices!
1,Does not even deserve 1 star!!! This DVD was NOT the DVD rcvd',"The DVD I RECEIVED WAS A HOST OF REPETETIVE CARTOONS SIMULATING POSITIONS, NOTHING NEW, NOTHING THAT I EXPECTED AT ALL. DO NOT BUY!! BUYER BEWARE..."
1,Erotic video sampler,I was dissapointed when I first saw this video. It was very boring.All it showed was various drawings and illustrations one after another of sex positions demonstrated by those characters seen in those ancient kama sutra drawings.I would prefer to see real live people demonstrating sexual positions instead of watching a bunch of illustrations.
3,This version is Volume II with only 4 tales,"Not a complete version. This is Volume II which contains The Wife of Bath's Tale, The Clerk's Tale, The Reeve's Tale, and The Nun's Priest's Tale."
3,Reiki....with an agenda,"Diane Stein's book is worth having in your Reiki collection but be sure to read it in critical thinking mode. The giving away of the ""secret"" symbols of 2nd and 3rd degree Reiki certainly increased her audience for the book but the symbols alone aren't enough to make you a Master. The stories of her giving attunements to mass numbers of people without also giving them the background of Reiki doesn't make for the best Reiki practioners. Take the useful information from this book but also try to leave her anger behind."
4,It's a very good book,"I am sick and tired of the quarelling between traditionalists and independent Reiki-practioners about who has "" The Wisdom "", even on this site.Ms Steins book combines different things, witch may be confusing indeed for beginners.But I found the book very usefull and honest.I am a traditionalist I and an independent II and feel fine with it!!"
5,Reiki at its best,"I recommend this book to ANY Reiki Practicioner -either just starting or quite advanced. After reading the book, Diane Stein held a Reiki Master Class close to my home, where she taught for a full weekend. Diane is a wonderful person, one whom I admire and respect - not just for her Reiki ability, but for her spirit and love of all that surrounds her. The book is written in easy to understand terms, and is a great reference book should you need it. Buy the book...its the next best thing to her class!"
5,Fabulous book people need to calm down,I just got reiki one attuned and my master talked about the symbols weeks before that. I dont understand why the symbols are meant to be a secret when reiki should be known to everyone for their own personal healing. Dianes book is very well written. She does go off on a buddhistic approach at times but its so informative and powerful that its a must have for a student of reiki and certainly for people who want to know more about this subject.
5,Reiki is no longer a secret system of healing.,"Diane Stein brings the three degrees of Reiki all together in black and white so all may see and know the Reiki system of healing. She is courageous because she takes the tradition of secrecy as inappropriate for today's needs. We all need to know and understand that we are all healers and we can relearn the lost art of self and other healing once again. As we heal ourselves we heal one another and the planet and can move forward in our spiritual, mental, emotional and physical growth and developement. However, we still need each other to pass the energy of light from one to the other. What better way to share love and light and hope for a better tomorrow."
4,Love it.,"I have learned so much from reading this book. It is written in simple to understand words and has a lot information, ideas, examples of situations about different types of healings, meditations, manifesting, etc. I have tried some practices/exercises from this book and it works. I love it!"
4,Easy to Read,"Easy to read Essentials of Reiki. The author has a great point of view and makes the best efforts to clarify the meaning of Reiki, how it will affect us once we get involved, and the history of how we came to have this healing art."
4,Essential Reiki: A complete guide to an ancient healing art,"Having just completed my Masters in Reiki a few weeks ago, my teacher suggested that if we can, read this book to gain a different prospective in this craft as there is a lot of material out there and you will pick up some stuff that will resonate with you and some that won't. I found this book quite informative and whilst there are some aspects that do not suit me, other bits did. A very comprehensive book giving heaps of detail. I especially loved the extra reiki sign, I have tried it and it is a amazing. I gained a better insight to distant healing as well. All in all, this is a very worth while book to have in your Reiki library, I know that I will be using this as a reference tool when I start to teach."
1,search the google. you will get much better information,"I wish she stopped using Goddess and she all over the place. Diane definitely is a feminist and a wiccan. Since this is a Reiki book, she should have converged her writing to Reiki, instead of jumping all over her wicca, mantak chia, and tibetan buddhist background. If you want to learn about Reiki, search the google with ""Reiki Symbol"" and you will get much more straight forward answers. Nothing new is in this book, and if anything, she is confusing the heck out of the traditional and progressive Reiki practices."
1,I have not received this book yet,"I have not received this book yet, although it has been a month since I ordered it, and other books I ordered from you at that same time arrived very promptly.Is it lost or do I need to wait longer for it to arrive. Thanks for your help with this."
1,This book offers some inaccurate information...,"I am a Level II Reiki practioner. During Level I, our class was specifically cautioned about this book because it contains some inaccurate information regarding the symbols and their use. Out of curosity, I sought out this book, and indeed it does contain some information that is completely the opposite of what we were taught. I confirmed the inaccuracy of the information with a different Reiki Master. Additionally, I too sensed the anger of the author when I handled the book."
4,Nice introduction to Reiki,"This book is great for inspiring those with a beginning interest in Reiki to find a qualified Reiki Master Teacher to attend classes, and learn to become a Reiki practitioner. Thank you Diane for bringing more people to Reiki training through this book."
5,A must-have book!,"This book provides a detailed, complete and clear-cut description of Reiki techniques and practices. It includes attunements and - to the horror of the ""traditionalists"" - all the known symbols previously kept secret. In my opinion, these are the days when information hoarding serves no good purpose whatsoever, so I applaud Ms. Stein's courage to reveal what she did. She also shares much of her experience, and I personally find it very helpful, as it alerts me to what I might be facing myself in my practice. Overall, if I had to own only one book on Reiki - this one would be it! Bravo, Diane Stein!"
1,Reiki Master in TX,"I have been a Usui Reiki Master since 1996 and have enjoyed reading through a lot of books on Reiki. I often share these books with my students as many of them contain gold nuggets of information that can be very helpful.Unfortunately, Diane Stein's book is NOT one of them. I find her teaching styles appalling. There is a lot of information in her books that is just flat out wrong. Can you imagine being one of fifty students in her day-long workshop and feeling confident leaving there in their new-found skills as a Reiki practioner? Let alone having time to know and learn a lot of valuable information? I site this book as one NOT to get or pay much attention to in your Reiki journey. This is a sad example of a Reiki manual."
3,Not bad once you get past the rhetoric,"Personally, I agree with previous reviewers on how Diane is a feminist and man-hater and very dogmatic, HOWEVER she really broke ground when it came to publishing information on Reiki.If you take out the dogmatic bits and focus on the good bits, it is a worthwhile resource.Not for the faint of heart, however."
2,Clouded and misguided,"Having read widely on the topic of Reiki, its application and history, I have to say that this book is hard to recommend. Most of the details you need to know are present, but you have to wade through a ton of feminist and new age 'concepts' to get to it. Reiki is not feminist nor new age, so those ideas do not belong in any 'essential' reiki text.Harder to ignore is the clouded thinking masquerading as fact that leads her to assert, for example, that Jesus was running around India using Reiki for years after the crucifixion. But dig deep, and you will find good information within."
5,Full of great easy to understand information!,I love this book! I bought and read a good bit of it before my Reki I & II class. It was easy to read and packed full of great info. I'm so glad someone had the courage to take Reki back to the people and make it more accessible to those of us who are interested in helping others. A must have!
3,Gives away the wrong secret symbols.,"I am a new Reiki Master, and was given this book as a gift. I haven't read it yet, but skimmed through it and was disappointed to find thatshe gives away the secret symbols, the only thing is, they are the wrong symbols, and some are missing. If you are going to do it, do it right.I have read many reviews by people who are upset about the authors use of HER throughout the book. To them I say ""get over it"", take what you likeand leave the rest. It's a non issue."
5,"esential reiki,a good start","Passes the test, this is the best place for one who wants to learn about reiki prior to attunement.it goes far enough for you to want to see a reiki master to learn more."
5,Reiki Rightly Revealed,"Kudos to Diane Stein. The shroud surrounding Reiki has be perpetuated and passed down the lineage of Reiki Practioners and Masters until it seemed more like a secret club with its very costly admission limited to the annointed few.Ms. Stein has written a marvelous guide to and for Reiki Practioners. What The PDR (Physicians Desk Reference) is to doctors the ""Essential Reiki: A Complete Guide to an Ancient Healing Art"" should be to the Reiki community.Brava Ms. Stein. This book will be a part of all my teaching."
3,Not a complete guide,"Although she may have performed a good service by revealing the symbols, she has created the mire of nonsense that prevails about their purpose and value. As such, her book simply expresses a narrow and simplistic viewpoint on what and how reiki is.Based as it is on Buddhist practices and meditations, Reiki is not something that you can be merely told, but something you have to examine and consider for yourself to be effective. Thus, there is no equal to having a teacher, or spending time considering all the issues (most of which are not included in this book) and gaining an understanding for yourself.Were it a complete guide, for example, it would look more at the history and development of the symbols, and their actual orgin rather than mere continuing the 'prevailing wisdom', and adding its own lies such as that you cannot perform Reiki without attunements. This book functions as a useful tool and reference, but a complete guide it is not."
2,The book was very woman orienated.,"The book was from a clear woman""s view. This should have been stated befor the sail. The content was good but the slant was not open to all."
3,"Some good info, but also uneven","This book has been mentioned to me and I have seen it cited in other books so I decided to read it. Unfortunately it left me with mixed feelings. While there is some useful information, parts of the book are speculative and Stein seems to want to marry Jesus and Reiki to Buddhism. In parts of the books Stein comes off as a bit of a loose cannon. Some of her advice makes you wonder. For example there is a table for emotional sources of disease and for migraines the source is ""anger and perfectionism, frustration"" and under it advises ""masturbate to stop."" I believe that Stein's heart is in the right place and she is well meaning, but I take this book as her personal journey and the advice with a grain of salt. I think of it as a supplemental guide with some useful parts, but I wouldn't want to use it as a teaching guide nor would I say it lives up to the its title as a complete guide."
4,"Intriguing, eye-opening, lead me to search- out Reiki","I think that I was somehow lead to this book. I was only mildly interested in the subject of Reiki, specifically, but had always been looking for a path. Once I browsed Diane's book, I had to have it. I feel that this book has lead me towards a great path, with both clarity and openness. I only wish that Diane had provided us with names of Reiki Masters,or Reiki schools, from whom we could attain further instruction and attunements."
5,An essential book!!!,"Diane Stein is my teacher's teacher.I always recommend this book to my Reiki students, not because is the best book on the subject (there's none ""best""), but because is a fundamental book in the short history of Reiki.Diane made the teaching available, this is her main contribution. She disclosed it.In her text, however, she added other flavours not necessarily part of what Reiki purely is.You can disregard Taoist techniques, Wiccan rituals, Gems and Crystals, pro-Shivaist speculations and Radical Feminism, and get just to the point: Reiki is a spiritual path of healing effects, easily available.Means: don't need to buy commercial-Reiki or sectarian-Reiki, so spread out there.Most important of all: this Reiki *works*."
4,Adequate information,"I received my Reiki (Pronounced Ray Key) Master/Teacher certificate last year, and am a member of the GRMA (Global Reiki Masters Association). I started reading Reiki related books in hopes of finding one or more Reiki Related books that I could recommend to students that come my way. This is the only Reiki book I recommend as of January 10, 1999 However; I do have problems with some of the material in this book. This book does have the following things going for it. 1. The history of Reiki 2. adequate hand positions. 3. Included the symbols used with Reiki 4. Directions for passing all levels of Reiki attunements. Ms. Stein has done a good job at demystifying Reiki, and bringing it out of the shadows. If you have questions about Reiki feel free to contact me by E-Mail."
1,It should be called Misinformation 101,"If you know nothing about Reiki, this book will spark your interest, however, there is way to much misinformation. Some of her practices are not only degrading to serious Reiki practicioners but they are also highly unethical. I believe that the Reiki attunements are a gift that is given, when you are giving attunements to rows of people at a time, you aren't giving a gift you are working in a factory. Reiki is about the one-on-one connection between teacher and student or care giver and recipient, it is something special to be shared. Reiki is fine dining but she turns it into a drive up fast food order."
2,Needs to be more clear on what is reiki and what is not,"Diane does both a great service and disservice all at once with this book. One the plus side, she brings reiki out in the open so it is accessible to all. My problem with the book, is that she presents alot of material that is not reiki and is not always clear on what is and what is not reiki. Her Chi Kung exercises, are not reiki. Chi Kung is a seperate discipline that needs to be taught by a trained instructor, and can be potentially harmful without a competant instructor. Her history of reiki with a lineage back to christ, while amusing, is historical fiction and should be labelled as such or a the bare minimum labelled as her opinion only. There is also a decided Wiccan feel to the book, and while wicca is a wonderful time honored tradition, it is also not reiki. Her feminist writing style was amusing, and i actually enjoyed that."
1,A Disgrace To An Amazing Healing Art,"I have been a Reiki Master/Teacher for 8 yrs. I am sickened by the utter lack of respect Diane Stein has for this ancient tradition. She's taken something held sacred by many and turned it into a way for her to make money. I have been told by many who have read this book and never received an attunement or attended a single class that they believe they are doing Reiki. I've experienced the energy coming from these people, and it is not the amazing healing art form known as Reiki. Putting the ancient traditions, even though a lot of what she cites as tradition is VERY incorrect, into print only allows more unskilled and unqualified people to harm those who come to them for assistance. Not only do I NOT recommend this book, I make sure in the ""ethics"" part of all my classes Diane Stein, and those like her, are shown as a classic example of why people MUST look for credentials when selecting an alternative practitioner."
5,Service and condition of book,"My copy of ""Essential Reiki"" came within the promised time frame and was in great condition. The price was perfect for my pocketbook."
4,An interesting investigation,"This is an interesting look at Reiki.For the die-hards there may be a little too much information for your sensitivities. This book reveals the sacred symbols,(sacred does not mean secret) tells how to use them and allows anyone insight into this ancient healing art. For those of you with an attunement this is not a threat unless you are only interested in making money from it and so do not want too much competition. Diane has covered most aspects of Reiki healing, but it is important to remember that attunement and lineage are the most important factors in being introduced to Reiki."
3,"Boring read, but it will get you there",It is a decent intro book into Reiki if you can stay awake. Maybe there is something else out there. Read the first few pages and see if you nod off before buying.
4,Excellent book for beginners and advanced Reiki practitioners,"This book is the ""Reiki 101"" for anyone who is starting to study and practice Reiki and a good reference for the experienced ones. It was a marvelous thing Diane Stein did to publish the Reiki symbols for the first time for the general public when this book was released, a real gift! It also provides inside information on the Tibetan origin of the Symbols that I haven't found in other books. The writer has a rather feminist style which I think diminish to some extent the quality of the outstanding work she has done to put together the information contained in the book."
4,Got Symbols? Reiki revealed...,"This book is truly a guide to discovering and understanding an otherwise perplexing specialty. Reiki is ancient, seasoned, secretive (until this novel) and earned and this book allows interested parties to LEARN Reiki. Diane's guide doesn't suppress this beautiful art and gives the gift of knowledge to those who are open enough to receive it. The specialty of Reiki can be up to a 25% markup on regular MT services and as such can be of sincere healthy profit to its Masters and practitioners according to The Magic Touch: How to make $100,000 per year as a massage Therapist by Meagan R. Holub. ""The magic Touch:.."" is a great guide on how to turn a regular, unremarkable career into a truly successful one. Meagan's book houses sections on intuition, mind and body relaxation and emotional health. Buy these two books together for a true guide to success in this niche."
4,reiki,Essential Reiki: A Complete Guide to an Ancient Healing ArtBook is very good recommended for reiki class I am taking.Very helpful
5,enjoyed reading this book.,"I read through the book quickly to get a rough idea of what Reiki is about. After I had gotten in contact with several Reiki teachers I know they were all different. And I agree with the author about the different ways it is taught. It is about money for many people. It should not be the only motive. If it's as good as the books say I will know after I experience it come the weekend. I am going to a free workshop about Reiki. Having read the book I will know what to expect and if I don't get it I'll keep searching for the right teacher. I know people who are reiki masters but they are not about to help anyone for free, not even a demo to prove the goodness of it.I believe any healing practices should be shared."
4,There's a lot of information in this book. . .,"much of which I don't agree with. For instance: ""People did not evolve on Earth, we were brought here from a variety of planetary cultures, and a number of channelers are now also describing them in their writings."" Aside from Stein's metaphysical views, one must also contend with her anti-male slant. Curiously, she relies heavily on Buddhist ideas in her thinking--one wonders how she could be unaware that organized Buddhism, like the other established world religions, has its own ways of keeping women in their place, at least in the East.However, there is a lot of information about Reiki and energy work in this book that is helpful. Stein knows a lot about healing, and presents her information clearly. She truly wants her readers to succeed at healing. The information on passing attunements is very good, as is the background on the various symbols. Thus I recommend this book, even though I find some of her ideas to be rather undisciplined."
1,"Superficial and confusing, attending specially newcomers","When I discoverd her book, I got shocked by seeing the sacret simbols published for everybody. For me, it is not a sign of maturity to ""break a seal of milenear tradition"" but of not understanding of the reason. ""Reiki is an oral tradition"", Grandmaster Hawayo Takata states during her life. I believe Mrs. Stein never really understood the real meaning of it. People doing distant attunement maybe because having fear to enter into and to accept there personal responsibility in the relationship with the student. A ""long distance master"" does have still a personal relationship with his student? I believe not. Is Reiki just a mechanical treatment, switch on an energy so that it flows and nothing more? I believe not.It is my experience that Reiki can be much more in one's life than Mrs. Stein was able to express in her book.Upanishad K. Kessler"
1,There are better Reiki books out there!,"I am a Usui Reiki Master. Although informative in some areas, I found this book to stray too far from the traditional Reiki ideals and traditions. I also felt that the author interjected her opinion too often to make this a useful handbook for a Reiki student. I strongly disagree with Ms. Stein's mass attunements; giving attunments without instruction or information seems irresponsible to me. As I read that particular passage, I felt she was diminishing Reiki to some sort of ""hippie fad"" or something equal to face-painting at a carnival. I read it and tossed it aside, and have not recommended it to any of my students or others interested in Reiki."
5,This is an extraordinary book,"In prose beautiful for its sheer economy as well as its clarity, here is the story of the genteel life adopted by a survivor of the least genteel event of the century. There are hidden costs associated with the comforts of Ben's chosen path, not least of which is his self-image, as a man who is perpetually late to realize the existential significance of major choices, and late to act thereupon; a man who misses chances; a man out of sync with his own life.This is simply an extraordinary story, told with a courtliness and understatement evocative of William Maxwell and Ford Madox Ford, from the author of About Schmidt, Schmidt Delivered, Shipwreck, Mistler's Exit, Wartime Lies, and As Max Saw It."
3,"Good writing, no story","Although this book is about Ben, his story is told by his college friend, Jack. Why? I have no idea. Jack's life is orderly and traditional. Ben, a ..survivor, finds love and rejects it. Jack knows all through reading Ben's journal and because Ben tells him all at their occasional lunches.I just didn't get this book. I've read three others by Begley. All were excellent, told believable stories, had interesting characters and satisfying conclusions. I finished this one only because I started it.Also, there is way too much male fantasy [stuff]. How many scenes of anonymous or paid for intercourse must a reader witness to get the point? And I am certainly tired of ""beautiful"" but problematic women and the repetitive descriptions of ..[them]. Enough already!Many sharp details do not a novel make. If you want to sample Begley, read ""About Schmidt."""
5,The perfect wine cooler...,"My Wine Cooler came today and I couldn't be more pleased. It is just want I was looking for, something that was simple, straightforward and elegant. This fits the bill to a tee and I can't wait to put it to good use.Update...Put the chiller to the test last night and it worked like a charm. It's large enough to hold a chunky champagne bottle, so I wasn't sure how it would keep a wine bottle chilled. But chilled it kept it, and for several hours none the less. I am very pleased and know it's going to give me years of drinking pleasure. I also purchased the Blomus 68493 Bottle Stop to go along with it; they really do look like they were meant to be used together."
5,Great wine chiller,I bought this wine chiller because of it's neat and simple design. Once it arrived I was immediately pleased with the apparent quality. It's got a good weight to it and you can tell it's made very well. And of course it gets the job done effectively. Good product.
4,Genis Of The Devil Review,"yes, this certainly is the genis of the devil. it is not Marilyn Manson's best work, but he's on his way up the becoming/passing of the anti-christ, the omega, and much more.all of the live songs are recorded at Church of Preverted.this is a great cd.Son of Sam is like Black Sabbath's Iron Man, in that there is the same music, and some of the same words.There is a live recording of Misery Machine, and the first ever recording of Marilyn Manson, Misery Machine. And in my opinion, if theres 2 recordings of Misery Machine, how can a cd be bad?Also the is My Monkey, the lyrics about a monkey are taken from the infamous serial killer, Charles Manson."
1,Poor Quality All over,I must admit that when i heard they were going to release Marilyn Mansons earlier stuff i was expecting much more. It is great that they have son of man on there but chances are if your a marilyn manson collector then you already have a much better quality of this song wich is sad i found out this only after buying the cd. Strange Same Dogma and White Knuckles are two really great songs but i dont like paying 16 dollars for just two studio quality songs especially if its surrounded by poor quality. The rest are demos at best and remind you of that time you decided to record your garage band for the first time with anything that could hold tape. Yes even Flood and Reznor couldnt patch these demos up in any given amount of time.
1,Strong Advice Against!,"I had 2 goals: Be able to watch the rare VCR, and be able to record tv programs to dvd, as needed. Hence, this unit, which (as advertised) should be able to accomplish either.This thing is more finicky than Morris the Cat.Expect major headaches, and a set-up time of >30 minutes EVERY time you make an additional attempt to record something with this thing. (The success of the project I'm working on at this moment: not yet determined.)Sometimes you can't even open the dvd drawer. Sometimes it pops closed again before you've inserted the dvd. It seems to respond to its own remote with very random success. You may be lucky, you may not. Tomorrow expect different results. Right now, I'm rescanning cable channels as it seems to have lost its willingness to recognize anything above 20.I am not really THAT dumb. I should be able to use a basic electronic device. This one is possessed. I urge you to look elsewhere."
3,WTF..?,"This machine worked good for the first two weeks, then I noticed that it would just freeze and I'd have to unplug it to get it to respond. it does not seem fully compatible when you watch a DL dvd then switch out to watch a 4.7 gb DVD, Often it loses the signal and I have to unplug it yet again for a few minutes to get it back online. It is very frustrating to spend my money on electonics and more often than not end up taking them back cause its defective or just trashing it. I CAN NOT recommend this DVD player for any reason and Toshiba is err... was my favorite company to buy electroncs from since Sony now Sucks.."
1,DONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO RECORD ATSC,"I recently purchased this product from a big chain.I bought it to record digital over the air programs. I can only record 3 channels nbc,fox and pbs. What gives there is nothing in the manual saying it will do this. I didnt realize this would be an issue till it was toooooo late to return it!! The tuner is slow. Also alot of the channels freeze and pixelate. I change to the analog and the picture is fine. This is going to make a great doorstop when i purchase a working model if there is such a thing.It also has frozen up on me a few times as well. You have to unplug and wait about 2 minutes. Then the piece of junk will work again!!!AS JIM CRAMER would say ""DONT BUY DONTBUY!!!"" ""THE HOUSE OF PAIN!!!!"""
4,Works great--but take note,"I bought this unit to connect to my new HDTV. Instructions on set up are clear and easy to follow. But I found that I cannot record closed captions off the cable system--only records digital broadcast CC. I have not connected the cable company's digital goof box (I think it has a built in DVR), so I may find I can get captions with a secondary hookup to the cable box. (We put men on the moon 30+ years ago, but we can't get simple cable/HD stuff??I have used Toshiba products in the past with great happiness--that's why I bought the Toshiba REGZA and this unit."
1,JUNK,This DVD VHS Recorder is worthless. It performed haphazardly for the first year and will not perform at all now when it comes to recording. It will accept recording schedules and then either turn itself off long before the TV show occurs or just doesn't bother recording. This is with either VHS or DVD. Don't waste your money.
3,Good Recordings / The Timer is a 50/50 gamble at best,"Makes very nice recording to DVD and does a fine job dubbing your VHS tapes to DVD. That being said if you are buying with a plan to use the timer to record in your absence, look elsewere. As at least one other person wrote ""recording failed"" is a common site. Also as another person noted I've seen it fail right before my eyes. I've checked and double checked only to find it's not me. I live in Silicon Valley and had a friend who is an engineer look it one Sunday. He was over for the day watching football. He tried it several times carefully doing the same thing only to see it fail to timer record 2 out of 6 times."
1,slow and grey image,"i purchased this item to replace both old vcr and dvd player but i was soon to be disappointed . The cable image with the old jvc vcr was clearer ,blacker . The image with this Toshiba is grey and at first i thought it was my connections or cables so i replaced them without any improvement .Another thing i hated is when i would change channel it is very very slow also it wouldn't play my recorded DVD's from my Canon camcorder .Just too many issues and i am now returning it and getting a panasonic"
1,Not a good item for families,There is no way to delete channels completely. You can skip them when using channel up/down but kids can manually enter channels you don't want them to see. Also the tuner takes 2 seconds to change channels. No way to correct these problems.
4,This machine performs quite well,"My husband put all our old family VHS tapes on DVD with this machine. He was quite satisfied with what the machine can accomplish for the amount of money spent. Our tapes are now preserved on DVD, until the next new thing... Good purchase all around."
1,Not good,I had a problem with this VCR it would not transfer some VCR tapes to DVD. Appears to be a commom problem with the machine. The seller promptly refunded my money.
4,not that easy,"Ths system came quicley & in good condition. The set up was complex & not always user friendly. I had to call for help on a couple of issues.In Him, Dr. Carl"
3,"Really great item, but.....",I do like this item. I used to love it. Then I tried to program timer recordings of certain shows I wouldn't be home to watch. I would set everything up perfectly but the shows wouldn't record. All I'd get was a big error message on the screen saying that the content I was trying to record was protected & couldn't be recoreded. Apparently many shows are being broadcast with copy-protection and this machine will not allow the casual viewer to simply make a disc to be viewed later at one's convenience. I'm not a video pirate and I deeply resent being treated as one. Once I've recorded a show I'll watch it. Then I'll either erase the disc or add it to my collection. I don't make extra copies to sell on streetcorners or on eBay but I guess the networks and Toshiba think the best way to thwart the bootleggers is by screwing the innocent along with the guilty.
1,Unit not respond,"Last month, I bought this Toshiba D-VR650 for home entertainment. I liked the design and features specified in the unit. Regrettably, I had no choice but to return this unit to the store due to unit froze up repeatingly(not respond to any control button),except to unplug the electrical power to reset the unit. I had a number of DVD players in the past and never experience with froze up issue before."
1,Nightmare!,If you are a masichist this is your machine. Mine's been to the repair depot twice and now I read all the reviews and see that ALL the flaws in this piece of junk are STANDARD. Call Toshiba and tell them what I did.They needed to lose the format war to maybe snap them into respecting their customers.
4,Toshiba DVR650,"Excellent recording on VHS and DVD (good picture); however, does not allow flexible DVD recording so you can end up with unused or not enough tracks on the end of the disc for multiple recordings. Also, the instructions on how to use the remote are challenging. Requires you to think in a circular manner. Do this...and then go back and do this. After a couple of mishaps, you finally catch-on."
2,Not good,"After complete installation of this unit everthing seem okay until I tried to record a TV program. It started formating as required and then at completion it just stuck and would do nothing. I could not open tray turn off unit until I unplugged from electric. I cannot give a favorable rating after that. I packed it up and sent it back. Now I am afraid to order another Toshiba, which has a good name for quality."
1,Nick Tunes is not worth the money,"The advertising on the package says that you can use the product for Karoke or duetThe microphone records just fine in about 10second intervals...The voices of my children do not get broadcast through the speakers as in a Karoke machine. The poor kids are singing away and they don't even get recorded... just one word when the program stops and goes into ""record"" mode.. What's worse is you can't hear my children sing... just the characters - the microphone does not broadcast through the speakers...The Microphone is only active during short spurts during the songsIf you advertise Karoke you should deliver it....and the voice recordings can't even be played backwards..."
3,"Nice, but pricey","Since I live in the heart of California earthquake country this unusual chip 'n' dip seemed like a perfect item for my kitchen - it won't break because it is made of stainless steel! I was so excited when I opened the box, but a bit disappointed when I realized that the bowl portion is, in fact, made of glass (I guess I didn't read the description well enough). I have used it many times and I always get compliments on it from my guests, but now that the novelty of a stainless steel chip 'n' dip tray has worn off I am starting to feel like I was a bit silly to have paid so much for it. It is also difficult to clean because it can't be put in the dishwasher. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a kitchen with a contemporary, modern look, but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who is on the fence about it because you may be like me and end up with a bit of buyer's remorse because of the cost."
1,Still waiting.....,I ordered this item over 3 weeks ago and am still waiting for it to ship. Do not recommend this item unless you are willing to wait and wait for it.
3,Never Shipped...,"I cannot rate this product, because I waited over a month and it still had not shipped. Every time I checked the status the ""estimated ship date"" got moved out. I needed it for a gift and couldn't wait any longer so I finally had to cancel. How disappointing!"
4,My favorite bra ever!,"This bra is great! I am a 36DD, but I do not need a lot of support, and am far apart. This bra is fabulous - 2 layers of stretchy fabric that conforms to my shape (not like those foam bras that try to make my shape conform to them!) and doesn't make me have uber-cleavage! I can wear it all day w/out fussing over it every 15 minutes. The straps are also very comfortable and can cross over in back for cut-in shoulder tops. I have even used it as a halter!"
5,great bra!,Love this bra (especially with racer back tanks!). It is great for minimizing (as there is no padding). Shipping was prompt as well!
4,Live Outlaws,Great live version of Ghost Riders In the Sky! Awesome live band with Hughie leading the way.
4,Not for experts but great for beginners...,"If you're looking for a guide to help you impress your friends with a bunch of fancy baseball lingo, this is not for you. On the other hand, this guide is great for someone who doesn't know a lot about baseball but wants to enjoy the game. It's clear, concise, and easy to read."
4,Baseball Dad,"As a baseball fan, college athlete, and father of school age all-sports kids, I appreciate this pocket ""Sport Spectator"" guide. This informative, easy to read guide is an excellent introduction to the game of baseball, perfect for parents and new fans in the stands. In ten minutes the spectator gets an overview of the game including the rules, temanology, field of play, and basics of how the game is played. To best enjoy the game, I absolutely recommend this pocket guide as an introduction to the game of baseball."
1,Poor Understanding of the Rules,"A synopsis of this book was submitted to our Umpire's Discussion Board for review. We found MANY errors in just two pages of discussion from this book.It contains many myth's common to laymen that really don't understand the game. This isn't a very good primer on baseball, it perpetuates inaccuracies, and was written by someone who really doesn't understand the rules of the game."
1,10-year umpire and coach says look elsewhere...,"Having read the summary of this book on the SportsSpectator website, I can tell you as an experienced baseball coach and umpire that this book will create more MISunderstanding of the game of baseball than if it had never been written. There are MANY inaccuracies and flat wrong statements in the summary; one can only presume that the entire book would contain even more wrong statements.Save your money and look for a basic baseball book that will actually teach you the rules CORRECTLY, rather than purchasing this drivel that will leave you even more confused than you started."
2,"Large amount purchased, some problems!","I'm overall, very happy with this collection of chairs, chaises, and tables. 16 chairs, 12 chaises, 4 large tables, and 4 small tables purchased. 5 Benches purchased, with 3 of them having arms breaking at the weld!!! Have not been able to repair them, and have gotten NO satisfaction from customer service for either replacement or adjustments. Therefore....mixed review!!!!"
2,just my luck,"I read all the great reviews and the price was right, so I got it. It arrived with one of the arms broken where the weld is. As I said, just my luck! Called amazon custom service who did a price adjustment because my husband thought he could reweld it. Turns out it is not weldable with a regular old welder...you need a pop metal welder, whatever the heck that is. However, a friend looked at it and said to drill a hole and screw it together. Drilling the hole was not an easy task, but hubby did get it fixed and I painted the crack as best I could. So Amazon was good about adjusting the price, but I was not happy about it arriving broken even though it is servicable now."
1,Counterfeit!!!,"Will never buy from this company ever again! This is OBVIOUSLY a counterfeit perfume. A total waste of my time and money. I would not give this any stars, but it wouldn't let me."
4,What a great idea!,I thought this tape was brillant. I love to do Step Aerobics within my home but found that the baby would often get fussy and I got frustrated because I couldn't finish my tape BUT with this tape it is easily done. Not only do you get to a good workout you get to spend time with your baby. I actually broke a good sweat while doing th is exercise tape and I often do advanced exercise tapes. I wish there were more videos that included baby.
3,Walzer on War,"An interesting elaboration on the author's original argument in Just and Unjust Wars. The strengths and defects of his argument become more apparent. Can't help but get the sense that it is a peculiarly American view of the world and is rather (unfairly) dismissive of anti-war positions. The focus on WWII as the exemplar of a just war seems to me somewhat out-dated and a too easy position. It would be interesting, given Walzer thinks the American involvment in Vietnam was unjust, to consider the Vietnamese side of that war as an example of a just war."
1,Arguing about war,"In my opinion;It is unfortunate that Mr Walzer is at an advanced age as he is unlikely to actually learn about war so as to enable him to argue about it with credibility and understanding.Credit goes to the other (2) reviewers of this book as they did a very good job of writing to describe nearly all of the intelligible passages. The difficulty reading was not in the theory or concept, but the diarrhea of the pen that made too little sense too often. In addition, if Mr Walzer had an extensive, sorry wrong word, any historical understanding of the conflicts he was referencing, it was not apparent and appeared his depth of knowledge was incomplete or at best only tabloid headline deep.If you are looking for substance and coherence, do no not waste your time or money. Read the other reviews as they contain nearly all of the books relevant ideas and information."
5,Lost Classic,"I got a promo copy of this album when I worked at my college newspaper. Cut after cut is just awesome. I did not want it to end. Shame these guys never hit it big, they deserved much better. Fans of Replacements and Goo Goo Dolls should not miss this one."
3,"Airtex Fuel Pumps, in the gas tank, suck","Well I have replaced so many of them I don't what to say besidesit is IMPORTANT to ask the seller if they personally will give youa 1 Year guarantee, because 1 out of 5 of these pumps are junk and mypersonal opinion is due to them using plastic gears instead of brass onthe pump unit, never had a come back with the older model type, but if theygive you the unconditional guarantee with out telling you they need to test itat there facility first, and all that other crap, then get it, because i wentthrew hell, with a company out of Florida that is on Ebay, that sells so calledAC Delco and Airtex, JUNK, and will not stick to there Life Time Warranty, afterjust 60 days, so if that tells you anything make sure you can send it back, I nowbuy them from a local auto parts store so I will have no problem with a return.Do Not Trust the China made products, I don't know why they don't just make them as we do, buy USA"
5,GOOD SERVICE,"met all my expectations. Item was as described. shipped on time, was very pleased with everything, would recommend to all"
5,Works as well as the original Sharp charger,I installed it in my video recorder with no problem. Let it charged overnight and it worked great the next day. The battery holded the charge. Great replacement product.
4,worth the money,this is a good battery when yours goes dead or lost. not the perfect replacement but it does the job.
1,Complete garbage,"This battery charged up once and that was it. It worked for about a half hour and needed charging. Placed in charger, it would not charge."
5,A Curiously Engaging Mystery,"A mystery movie that bears repeated viewing, and will be sure to at least leave you debating it's conclusion for days afterward. One of the best things about independent cinema is that this is not a traditional whodunnit, but is a mystery nonetheless. It is also refreshing to have a mystery set very muchly in contemporary times, minus exotic commuter trains and monocles. It is given 5 stars exactly because it elicits feelings that could be construed as frustration."
4,Full Term Lover,"I dont need to say no more that is one of my favorite songs of all time, if you dont remember this song please sample it and the songs Born to Breed is hot too dont sleep on the Old School because the hiphop songs back then had feeling I dont really feel the feeling in these songs now"
2,Looked worn,"I ordered this book for an award for a student. It was listed as a new book, but upon arrival, the cover of the book looked worn and dirty. Very disappointed."
4,Enjoyable space techno-thriller.,"I found this an enjoyable space thriller with a great insight from someone who actually flew the shuttle. The suspenseful setup and pacing were great, as were the characters, and the tense buildup throughout kept me reading and guessing. It wrapped up a little too quickly for me - hence me giving it only four stars - I would have liked the climactic end to have been given as much attention as some of the buildup. But that may just have been me. Overall, a good read."
1,Don't Buy This Item -- Worthless!,"This is a complete piece of junk. The light is so dim, that a picture can only be traced in pitch dark. Unless you want your child staying up until midnight just so he can trace a picture, I'd suggest you pass on this toy!"
4,Disney makes the magic shine...,This is so much fun... but it is still as long as the original. I love this one better because I am a Disney freak! Everything about the game has a Disney theme now. But the rules are the same as the first one. If you are a fan of Monopoly then you will also love this version long as you like Disney. I find it great for the family to sit down and play! Just as long as they have patience as it can be a quite long game at times.
1,wow,"Are you kidding me? Clearly, Disney is are very proud of this game. I am sure that it is worth it."
3,Engagingly Designed,"My grandchildren and I enjoy the Disney motif of this Monopoly game. They relate to the properties, card instructions and generally artistic setting. It IS still Monopoloy, however, so for a complete win, the length of play time looms long."
1,these titles are animated but not advertised as such,"I ordered this product believing it was the real movies as there was no indication otherwise and fully expected to get such. Upon opening the packaging I was suprised to see it was all animated. Obviously, I was very disappointed and felt cheated. I feel the seller should acurately describe the product."
4,I like this one very much.,I had not heard this before purchase and was very pleased. I received my CD without waiting and in great condition. I am still looking for Scarlatti however; without any luck.
2,"Looks cute, but ...","very dissapointing purchase. It's made of canvas and rubber, like a pair of tennis sneakers, so it appears to be a very sturdy case. The casing also has good screen protection. But the stiff constructions makes it extremely difficult to remove the iPod from the case. I dock my iPod in speakers almost daily, so it's important to me to have easy access to the iPod. To remove the iPod from the case, I am forced to push the iPod out of the case, through the back opening using the spinwheel access window - something tells me that pushing on the spin wheel repeatedly and forcebly is not a good thing to do to the ipod.Most important reason I'm dissapointed in this purchase - the thick rubber casing around the lock switch makes it impossible to access the switch with your fingers. How would you feel about using a pen to lock and unlock your iPod?"
2,looks nostalgic... but...,"I had to do some creative cutting on this case with a pair of scissors to make it functional. The plastic around the hold button was to narrow and to thick to get a finger into to flip the switch, and the earphone jack on some of my earphones wouldn't fit through the opening in the case enough to make a good connection. After cutting it a bit... works, but looked bad. then had to apply a bit of white model paint to make it look like it is supposed to. If you let it sit in the sun or in your closed car the glued seams begin to separate which leaves sticky glue exposed on the canvas. If you don't mind tinkering with it a bit it's an OK case. Good screen cover and looks cool."
5,Wonderful for beginners,I own a quilt shop and I always have the new learners purchase this book. All patterns are for rotary cutting and are easy to make. It is a wonderful book.
4,Young mistress takes a brief tour on the plantation.,"Unique film indeed. Rarely films are made on such subjects. Film highlights race relations. A true image of America during the 1930's. Bryce Dallas gives a close to perfection performence, Isaach De Bankole... oh boy, he almost stole the show, his decent action results in a very neat chemistry with Bryce and you just can't take your eyes off the pair on screen. Its a bold film, quite bold. You will smile, you will be shocked, you will keep staring. Its a film with a brilliant cast performence. Worth watching."
1,"Unrealistic, Feels Cheap and Contrived","I turned this movie off part way through. First of all, it's not even a movie but a video recording of essentially a stage performance with bad lighting.The idea seemed interesting, but it moves at a strangely hurried pace and the interactions among the characters seem really...clumsily scripted.The pictures on the front and back of my copy (different than what is shown here) depict a landscape and a house - none of which is even part of the show. The entire set it on a flat, white stage.Not worth watching! Blahhhh!"
1,ATTN: Those of you who value life more than art...,"If you value life more than art, please don't bother with this film. Lars von Trier, operating under Swedish law by which animals may be killed for cinema, had a donkey butchered for a scene in this film. He later cut the scene from the movie because he was afraid of the controversy.I need not say any more. If you disagree with the slaughter of animals for the sake of art, you will know to avoid MANDERLAY. If, on the other hand, you believe it is acceptable to kill animals for movies, go for it."
3,Merely pleasant,Even Hacket at his solo classical best sounds can sound like a technical exercise that eventually grows repetitive.
2,Not Toto.,I think as Tito got older he went more Jazz.. My daughter thought it was elevator music. It you like Jazz you will enjoy it.
3,READALIKES,"Read this so long ago, but it came to mind after reading ""A Time for Dancing"" by Hurwin. If you're up for a well-written tearjerker, I highly recommend Hurwin's book."
3,JPs super review of brians song,One black and the other white. One is from one part of the country the other from another part. One is shy the other one is outgoing. Those are some major characteristics about the 2 main characters in the book Brian's song. As u can see their total opposites but they managed a way to be best friends. This story is not allot about football as much as it is and the two characters stories. Unfortunately Brian is diagnosed with leukemia and is hospitalized till he gets better. Showing their great friendship gale was with Brian every second he possibly could and was always next to his hospital bed. Well that's my review read the book to find out more.
4,Perfect present.,"I bought this as a gift for a 13 year old boy whose world is football. I felt I could entice him to read if I gave him a book about a subject he loves. I know the book is old, but the values it embodies are true in any time."
5,This CD is pumped full of energy.,"The CD ""Superior Machines"" is full of energy and is very up beat. From songs like the title track ""Superior Machines"" and ""Sister, Sister"" to ""The Envelope Song"", it is sure to get anyone up singing and dancing along with the guys. Once hush has come along way, and this CD is proof of that. From Alan's amazing keyboard playing, Loren's precise drum playing, to the singing abilities of Greg Riordan and Eric, to Greg White's guitar playing skills. Eric has such an amazing range in his voice. I highly recommend this CD, and see if you do not start singing and dancing around with these catchy tunes."
4,Too Bad,"I love this CD but it is too bad that Greg Riordan, the lead singer, is no longer with the band. The ""sound"" of Once Hush is no longer the same so buy this CD now and look for the older CD's."
4,"Jazz saxophonist says ""Muy Bueno"" ( spanish for very good)","Tito Puente won a grammy for this album, its well deserved. The title cut is awesome, Mambo Diablo starts out calm and builds to a powerhouse of premo latin jazz. If you like Tito Puente I strongly recommend this album. It contains many famous cuts and has a good variety of ballads and fast moving tempos. Anyone with a musical background can apprecate Tito's music. If your background is limited this is a good one to get introduced to salsa. I have only one qualm about Mambo Diablo, the CD could have been longer, at eight songs your are left wanting more. I liked this one, its a good addition to any collection. Muy Bueno"
5,5 Dec 2009 BBC Radio 3's choice for Building A Library,BBC Radio 3CD Review with Andrew McGregor5 December 2009 Building A LibrarySHOSTAKOVICH: Symphony No 15 in A majorReviewer - Rob CowanFirst Choice Recommendation
2,A GOOD REFERENCE VIDEO,"The video series, that this is the first volume of, has been floating around since the 1980s. As they were originally done in Japanese, you are at the mercy of whoever did the translation for this version. For die-hard Shotokan karateka of the JKA flavor, this tape covers kata Heian 1 to 3 as taught by Masatoshi Nakayama. Nakayama was perhaps the most dynamic of the Chief Instructors of the Japan Karate Association (JKA). My bias shows, my SHODAN (1st Degree, Black Belt) certificate is from the JKA and bears Nakayama's signature. This is about SHOTOKAN kata as it was done by THE MAN, Nakayama Masatoshi Sensei. Check out Nakayama Sensei's books here on AMAZON.COM -- I think you'll be happier with those than this version of the JKA tapes."
4,good product,"my kid's hair feels very silky and healthy after this conditioner, and she swims twice per week. Just hope that they offer more scents to choose from: the current grape one is OK but a bit too strong."
1,Beware,"The care instructions on these say ""Machine wash on cool delicate cycle. Line dry."" Unless you can follow these instructions, don't buy. When dried on low heat, they turn into a very wrinkled,slightly shrunken MESS!! Not what I want in a dishcloth!"
4,great sound,"What I love about this mobile is that the music sounds decent--it's not just tinny baby toy sounds that destroy the beauty of the music. Mozart actually resembles Mozart, so I don't get annoyed when I hear it every night. It's loud when it first turns on, but I always decrease the volume and it's fine. The only bad thing is that the light doesn't seem to do very much, and it seems to have died after 6 months anyway."
3,Could be a great mobile,If the sound turned completely off and if the tiny light yellow writing was easier to read. I had to put tape over the speaker because it was so loud. My 2 month old daughter does still seem to like it if I'm standing there with her.
3,Baby Likes it!,"Well, the baby is very well entertained by this mobile!Me....not so much! Problems I have had:- Volume doesn't work and so the only working setting is LOUD. I have tried pumping, etc...but no change. Tiny Love has said they will send me a new music box.- Took a while to assemble. Not as straight forward as one might think a mobile would be.- Doesn't tighten sufficiently and can topple over (but if baby is directly underneath it can't fall on him). This is a big mobile!But I do like that the pieces on the mobile move as the mobile goes around. I think this makes it more interesting, but he hasn't told me if he agrees!"
4,Great product but light function is weak,"This product is great. It captures the attention of my 1 month old like nothing else does, but the 'lights' are a little disappointing. Still great however!"
1,Terrible design,"I really don't know how anybody could give this more than one star. The design is so poor I couldn't even get mine to stand straight up. It just kept falling over. Do you think I would put my baby under this? Nope, returned it and will never buy anything from this company again."
2,Beware of PearleKids,"I got this in the mail from PearleKids, which I ordered through Amazon, and I didn't actually order this specific Mobile. I wanted the Animal Farm one but they sent me this one instead. So they sent the wrong product. I went ahead and opened it to make sure and it was leaking. So I packaged it back up and have been attempting to return it for about 2 weeks now. I can't get ahold of anyone from Pearlekids to give me info on how to return it. I emailed and called, leaving 2 messages. No return calls. I finally called my credit card company to dispute the charge but that takes 30 days usually. So if you buy this don't buy it from PearleKids!!!!"
5,Seems to Actually Work,"I use creatine to help recover from harder workouts, and, at lower doses, to help with fatigue. Seems to work in a noticeable way for both applications."
4,Hoover F6032-900,"I really like this product, the only draback might be for a smaller person who may find it heave and bulky. I do not .I like the convience of all the attatchments always hooked and ready to go at the touch of a button,I can get alot done in a short time Te tank size equals the tank recovery size , on my old one it had a smaller recovery tank and i was always emptying it ,now i fill one tank and when thats empty its time to empty the recovery tank"
4,Works good so far,We only used a bit but it did the job. Hotter water produces better results. I will update if I have anything negative to say later!
4,"Very interesting to read, written well.","I almost passed by this book when I read that it was not a true story but rather an Indian legend.I decided to buy it anyway. Glad I did.It was well written and one can ""hear"" this story being passed down from one generation to another.This would be a good story for children at school to read for it has real teaching in the message."
5,Wher has he been?,"A great record by a great music team! One can't believe Muñoz is not better known. With Eddie Gomez giving a hand in production, and of course with great bass work, in line with his best ever (what arco job here!!!), and Jeremy Steig playing flute on one track, this is a sure contender for the best jazz piano trio (and duo and quartet) record in the last few years. My favourite tracks: that with steig, and the latin ballads."
3,I didn't know this existed...,"I remember back in 1993 or so when me and my sister were driving with my aunt Lynn, talking about hip-hop, when she popped in a tape. It was Justin Warfield, and she told me that he was her Godson. The song was called ""Season of the Vic"". I don't know if any of you have heard it before. The song was about ""vics"" trying to get after your money at Christmas time. Kind of silly, but the beat was nice; something to chill to. I remember my aunt saying he was discovered by the same person who discovered Michael Jackson. I don't know if that's exactly true, but sad to say, I guess Justin didn't exactly reach Michael's heights. I never did meet Justin, or even talk to him. It'd be nice to know what he's doing now."
1,Misleading,I was not told at the time of ordering a CD from this seller that the version I was buying was edited for radio. Extremely misleading and definitely requesting a refund.
1,Seems To Be Of Poor Build Quality,"As I was tightening the guide to the chainsaw bar, the metal housing cracked. I got far less than I paid for."
1,Real bad design,"Bad design!!Spring nut does not tighten,comes loose every stoke of the file!Other Oregon chain sharpeners in the past don't have this problem with the angle tightening screw."
4,Great tool,"Works very well, especially useful for setting depth on cutters.I had funusing it, practiced on an old chain. If you are in a hurry just buy anew chain; if not, this looks like the best way to keep chain sharpat home."
2,Complete waste of $40,"I have used oregon chains and bars for years. They have always tended to be of average or better quality. I was quite supprised that Oregon would allow their name of such a poorly engineered and shoddy product. When the guide is set up exactly as per instructions, the chain guide will not allow the chain to pass through the clamps. Had I bought this thing locally, it would have gone back the next day. Rather than go through all the return hassels through Amazon, I just decided to chalk it up to experience and eat it. I have decided that it is better to just pay a little more and buy some things locally than to buy from Amazon, sigh unseen and end up with a useless peice of crap. Save your $40 and just buy a plain old round file and hand guide. You will do a better job of sharpening and save some money too."
4,BIA 4 piece Tureen Set,"I had been looking for a tureen for awhile now, and after seeing the price of one that matched my china pattern, I looked for good alternatives.I found an excellent alternative with this 4 pc set... It appears it is a three quart tureen (used a quart mason jar to measure), and it is a good size for my use. I would like to see the volume measurement on all, as buying one without this is like buying a pig in a poke. Lucked out this time...I appreciated the plate included in the set as it makes serving easier.The set came packed well, as did the ladle, but noted on the ladle, where it had to rest on the cones for firing, it was missing glaze. I thought it might have chipped, but after really looking at the pattern on the bottom, it comes from the firing of the piece. I may have to substitue another ladle, but still feel the set was priced ok.A nice set to have... can mix and match with all my china and that meant a lot."
4,An elegant way of serving,Its a traditional serveware for serving the soup course The color of the tureen set allows it to be used with many of the dinnerwares & the size is adequate to serve at least 8-10 people.The under plate is something not found with usual tureen sets which gives it an elegant look but it appears a little overpriced.
5,It doesn't get any better,"I grew up with this album in college in the eighties. Gary P. played a lot around San Angelo, Tx and he is the real thing, or was at that time. I find it to be the best true to itself album around. It is a folk/country/eclectic/hillbilly rock album that may not work for the California reviewer, but it's just right for me. My favorite is Tennessee road which is about Elvis. Then there is ""the Last thing I needed the first thing this morning"". Really great stuff! I am only mad at myself for not listening to it in a couple of years. I am going to end this review right now so I can go put on the scratchy ol' cassette that's been played until the you can't read the title."
2,Not the real thing,"Unfortunately, GPN without Jerry Jeff Walker is kind of like Paul McCartney without John Lennon - he needs Walker's raw and powerful counterpoint to balance out his own maudlin tendencies. Nunn's London Homesick Blues is of course an incredible classic. If you don't already have it, get the original on JJW's Viva Terlingua, one of the best progressive country productions of all time."
1,The armadillo armageddon is coming!,"Armadillos are sacred things and should not be taken lightly... Beware, the wrath of the armadillo is terrible and swift!!!!!"
3,where's the producer?,"Been an avid flamenco fan and having listened to the recordings of Juan Serrano through his books, I might said that this recording is not exciting I consider his performance rather sloppy without a clear direction. He is joined with a second guitar and percussion throughout the whole album. It starts with a rumba wich is actually a mixed version of a Sabicas's rumba and Paco de Lucia's Entre 2 aguas. Then there are tarantas, fandangos and certain titles uncommon like Danzon, Bolero and Romance which are again met with the same lack of production problem. The more exciting number is Panaderos which is a brilliant interpretation of the famous title from Manolo Sanlucar"
5,loved it,i received the of juan serranno it was great i bought his guitar music book 20 years a go this cd had all of the songs of his now i no what it suppose to sound like when playing his flamenco music. thank you.
1,disappointed,This item is very bulky. It IS easy on the hand but the wire is too loose and it will be practically useless in no time. The wire is not adjustable so it can't be tightened or replaced. Look elsewhere...
2,"Proview PL456S 14"" LCD Monitor ""aka"" MAG Innovision LT-456s","I purchased two monitors from Best Buy during a Black Friday sale. They were labeled as ""MAG Innovision LT-456s"" though I later found out they are Proview PL456S. Being military I left for deployment, returned and relocated duty stations before I getting to hook these monitors up. Upon receiving my household goods I hooked up both monitors and found both with dead pixels in the center. When I contacted Proview customer support I was told that I did not have ""enough"" dead pixels for them to do anything about it. Each of my monitors had at least 8 dead pixels, and were located in the center, just enough to be annoying.From my experience with Proview's customer support I can only recommend that you BE WARY of Proview and be sure to check your monitors for dead pixels and return them to your place of purchase as soon as possible for replacement or refund.""signed""an unhappy customer who is using a Proview monitor with dead pixels"
4,Good quality - overall good value,I bought this 14 inch LCD monitor to replace a 17 inch CRT monitor for my 4 year old son's PC. The 17 inch monitor took up his entire desk and was in danger of tumbling the desk over at times. The LCD monitor not only is safer for him but now frees up a lot of room for him to work at his desk in our office. The quality of the monitor is good and was easy to set up. He loves it and I am happy I bought it for him.
2,A dissapointment!,This DVD is obviously made from a clean but soft 16mm print. The sound is poor and at timesbecomes unlistenable. I was hoping for better quality. Buyer beware!
1,This book makes Baby Jesus cry :(,"What an ignorant book. Is this where our culture places Jesus Christ?! - on the same level as Santa Clause? ""Look kids, Jesus rides with Santa Clause in his magic sleigh and helps him deliver presents!"" It is disturbing to know that Christ is now just a fabel on par with Santa."
5,great book,I love eyewitness books due to the pictures and descriptions of the areas I;m interested in. Very informative!
2,Worst DK Guide I've purchased,"Back 2000 to 2005 I used the DK guides for London, Great Britain, Paris, Loire Valley, and probably some others along the way. They were GREAT, the best travel guides around. I just got the Costa Rica book and it falls far short of the depth of writing and local knowledge that the other volumes had. I've been to CR 3 times before as an independent traveler and wanted an updated book, so I went right to DK. Way too generic this time. Feels like they are coasting on past glory.Two tips for others buying travel guides - read a few sample sections in a book, then read the same sample sections in a couple of other books. It will help decide which writer's style you prefer, who gives the depth or type of info you're interested in, etc. ( I should have followed this advice!) The other tip is two buy 2 guides for a destination that are very different from each other - it can really enrich your decision making."
5,A Short Note of Appreciation,"Dear Ms Oland: Please accept this simple thank-you for your so very thoughtful and insightful recording of the Beethoven sonatas. Your performances rebuke a world blighted by the false values produced by instant communication, cheap celebrity, and shallow judgment. Tom B."
4,Beautiful Music at a bargain basement price!,"The music is absolutely beautiful. The playing is superb! The recording is also excellent. I am very happy with this purchase. There is only one ""yes but"" with my boxed set-when I play the cds using Windows media player, the menu says I am listening to Wilheim Kemphff? Checking the sleeve menus the time coincides with the time given for the selection on the sleeve of the cd. Still, this is irritating. It's the only reason I could not give the set a 5. Perhaps, this is only a problem with my set(I hope so for other's sake). That being said, I am keeping the box set even with the flaw. Truth be told once you start listening, it's hard to complain or sweat the small stuff."
5,JFK Assassination Research,"The Encyclopedia of the JFK Assassination Is an excellent research and resource tool. I do wish the manufacture would upgrade and re-release, this amazing product.I purchased many years ago and loaned it out... so I purchased again in 2006 from AMAZON. It is like having a dozen books on the Assassination of Kennedy, but compiled and accessible to everyone.This is an encyclopedia in that you can go to each section such as witnesses/weapons/timeline/photos/ etc, and be immersed in the details that would take hours of skimming through written material. All is present in a clear concise manner.I found my self just wanting to check one little item, and staying in the section. This is not a demo, but comprehensive Amazing gift of facts.This program will top the list of anyone interested in the details and facts, rather than the sensationalism of this period of our history."
4,tight Jam,"Prince&THE NPG get right here.Prince,Sonny T.&Michael Bland are stomping on this Jam.this song should have gotten more juice.it's still tight."
5,great kite & string on a large wheel,"I purchased this as a fathers day gift. I know one of my dad's has used it & had good results. It flew well with light wind & the string is quality & on large wheel. It came in a nice durable bag for travel (throw it in the trunk! so you have it when you want it!) & you can actually get it all back into the bag after using it.(I want to get one for myself as well. :0) Quality product.Great colors, has tail included which needs to be attached for good flight."
1,terrible...,"ugh. this pie plate seems to spill anytime you try to cut a piece out, its hard to clean and shatters easily."
3,Pie flipped out without buttering the plate,I'm not excited by this product but it just works and the price is excellent.
1,Pyrex pie dish exploded in the oven,"I bought one of these a year ago for special occasions. Used it only once or twice. Today it exploded in the oven after only 30 minutes of baking. (Apple pie, 425 degrees). Nicht gut."
3,i learned so can you,"if you love old time fiddle, stop listening and fiddle with it yourself.just follow along with brad in the video and you can do it.i did it."
3,Boo-Review Grrr,Unmistakebly Betty Boo but lacking some of the spunk and energy of the first record. Perhaps they tried to be strategic and save some songs for a next record but failed. Still a decent record but not in the same level of peppiness and party-feel as her first album.
5,Enchanting,Wow! What an enchanting world this author has created.I couldn't stop reading. Can't wait to read the rest of her books and I would love to see these magical visions on the big screen. Someone is going to make this into the next Harry Potter phenomenon. I'll be the first in line at the theatres. YES!
5,The greatest book ever!,"This is the greatest book ever! Kept me on the edge of my seat every time I picked it up to read. Full of hope and wonder. I lent it to my sister, a teacher, and she recommended the book to the school's librarian. Most of her students wanted to borrow it from her to read it, because she'd read some of the book outloud to them and they fell in love with it. I recommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!"
1,Shirley Temple Meets Steven King,"Simply awful: smarmy psycho- babble with occasional gratuitous violence...I read this book with the intent of presenting it to my daughter as a gift; I cannot in good conscience give it to anyone. The author takes an intriguing plot line and swings between preaching to and horrifying the reader. Boo, hiss."
5,New Christmas Carol,Holly Claus is the best book ever. The book is seasonal but it may be read during the summer. It is a gripping adventure about the only child born in the land of the immortals. The child happens to be the daughter of Santa Claus. But there is trouble there is a terrible curse cast upon her. This leads her to take a trip to earth at Christmas time. This is a splendid that will capture the heart of most readers. It teaches about kindness and generosity. It makes a wonderful Christmas gift.
2,Greatest Edited Hits,"Once again another greatest hits that edit's songs.I get most disappointed when songs which made them to the greatest hits stage are then edited when put onto the album,yes i am talking about Morning Dew,cut and edited.Then what makes it worse is there is no mention of this and you only find out once purchased.A great collection of songs yes, but their greatest collection of original hits i think not"
5,Fun firstnovel,"Loraine Despres has captured the perfect voice for Sissy LeBlanc, a former cheerleader bored with motherhood in a small Louisiana town in the 50's.This novel starts off as high spirited as a Fanny Flagg novel, but a darkness lurks in these pages as well. A great read!!"
4,Sucked me in!,"I truly enjoyed this book - like another reviewer here it was on my wish list for ages. I finally succumbed and am so glad I did! Sure, there are a few flaws (like why didn't Sissy have any friends at all?) and a few minor incidents left unexplained - but the story was good enough for me to forgive these oversights. Sissy is a likeable character with the same type of spunk you'd expect from a Sweet Potato Queen."
1,"Climax in every meaning of the word,the end you fall asleep","The title surely does not let the reader down the plot is another story. The romance, passion, and anticipated sin of the characters leave the reader hurtling down a mountain of words; it's a fast paced novel. The ending felt like the author had to wrap it up because she was late for a dentist appointment causing the reader to hurtle down the mountain only to hit face first into a cinderblock wall. My advice is to skip the last chapter and allow you imagination to fill in the gaps."
1,If you are going to rip off an American Classic...,"... at least make it creative. Any respectable ""Southern Belle"" should know that Despres ripped off an entire paragraph Gone With the Wind nearly verbatem with her description of Sissy as ""not attractive but men rarely noticed it..."" I bought this book excited for a fun summer read but instead was immediately turned off being a huge gwtw fan. If you are really dying to read it, get it at the library or bum around a bookstore, but don't pay full price like I regretfully did!"
5,Great Summer Read,I was so sorry to learn that this was the only novel by Lorraine available at the moment. It was such a captivating and fun read for the summer than I immediately pre-ordered her second book! This story has many twists and turns and keeps you turning the pages to see where Sissy will end up next! She a fun character with and interesting life and story to tell. I would recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a fun and interesting story.
4,A Roller Coaster of Twists and Turns,"When I bought this book, I thought the entire book would be based on this torrid affair that an unhappily married woman was going to embark upon, but it really wasn't quite like that at all. There are so many surprises in this book, that I found myself reading it every chance I got....This book is about dysfunctional families and relationships, and lost dreams, but it is enjoyable along the way. This is a great read. Oh if there really were men out there like Parker Davidson......"
2,The Tedious Summer of Sissy LeBlanc,"Extremely disappointing book, poorly written and poorly edited. I regret wasting my time and money on this book. I wouldn't recommend it or pass it along to a friend."
5,Fantastic!,"An absolute wonderful read especially at the beach! Great love story! This book is interesting because it begs the question ""what if?"" throughout the whole story. I like how Loraine Depspres wrote the book. She would tell part of the story and then give a flash back to explain something. This book is filled with twists and turns all the way till the ending and it has a fantastic ending leaving no stone unturned!Reccomend to anyone especially any one who has ever wondered ""what if""!"
4,You'll love it.,"Anyone who grew up in the South (especially the females) will definitely relate to this book. For those of you not so richly blessed, you'll still find it enjoyable and a good look into the lives of Southerners in the 50s.Give it a try. It's a fantastic read."
5,One of the best horror games on DC! Classic!,"Seriously Hard. If you get pwned a lot, don't worry, it's part of the fun. You basically have three health bars, one for health, one for stamina, and one for fear. If any of them gets too low, you die- which makes sense in a nightmare world that literally is an amusement park based on several horror films- you must fight through all of them- cheat if you can, because you'll need it. Very rewarding when you beat even one stage- if you don't give up easily and LOVE in-your-face pop-up horror, this is the game for YOU!"
1,dont waste your money or your time,I can honestly say that this is the worst game i have ever played. I got this used for six bucks and it totally wasnt worth the money. I suggest that everybody just stick to Resident Evil and Silent Hill for your survival horror needs because this game will just annoy you. The only reason i gave it one star is because the graphics arent a total loss.
2,Don't waste your time,"I absolutely love survival horror games & the Sega Dreamcast. So you'd think that there would be a pretty good chance I'd like ILLBLEED huh? Well, there was, until I played it.Horrible controls hinder this offering. It is too bad really as this game had an interesting premise and could've been something.Ah, what I am worried about... it isn't like any of you people who don't already own it will be able to track it down (or order it at this site) anymore anyway.But for those that try... you've been warned."
2,GREAT IDEAS MEAN NOTHING WITHOUT GREAT EXECUTION,"A B-movie horror-film producer puts up a million dollars to anyone who can survive a virtual house of horrors . But great ideas mean nothing without great execution and that's exactly what's happened here. Yes, Illbleed's graphics are Dreamcast quality and sure there are monsters all over the place, lots of areas to traverse and a good selection of weapons to use Yes, we even admire the fact that the game doesn't take itself too seriously (at all.) But in the end, it just isn't much fun. The best analogy I can offer here is that Illbleed is a lot like a backstage party with Ru Paul; all of the elements appear to be in place, but it's just not adding up to a good time. As bad as Blue Stinger was (also developed Illbleed is ten times worse My god, how do I escape this horrible nightmare?"" will be a question asked by Illbleed players everywhere. The game offers everything except the ability to take itself back to the store"
1,Warning: bad book!,"This is the worst astronomy book I've encountered in forty years as an amateur astronomer! It is full of errors and has some of the poorest illustrations (out-of-focus, incorrectly labeled) I've ever seen in a commercial publication. Anyone interested in buying and using telescopes would be much better served by NightWatch by Terence Dickinson, The Backyard Astronomer's Guide by Dickinson and Dyer, or Phil Harrington's Star Ware."
1,A poor excuse for a book on amateur astronomy,"I pity the novice who purchases this book with the intention of learning about amateur astronomy. The book is a demonstration of what happens when someone rushes it to publication, does not KNOW the subject and builds poorly on a work that wasn't very good in the first place. There are so many terrifically awful errors in this book, it would take another book to document them. Pictures of microscopes where telescopes should be, refractor telescopes described as Dobsonians, etc, etc. The illustration/pictures are also slipshod, out of focus and poorly rendered. I cannot believe a suposedly reputable publishing house could release this ""joke"" of a text on amateur astronomy. It should be withdrawn from the market NOW and burned. -Richard Anderson"
4,Sturdy and attractive,"This table was almost exactly what I was expecting. It is well-made, sturdy (and heavy!), and VERY simple to put together. The finish has a lot more grey to it than the picture shows, which was a little disappointing. That said, the finish is still attractive and will work with the other (non-Stratford Shaw) items I already own."
3,Good and Bad,"If you want an inexpensive fire table, this is a really nice choice, BUT - a couple of things to note. Amazon uses DHL for this item and as it's about 90 pounds and DHL won't allow you to set a delviery time, it can be a pain to actually get the table. Then, when we were able to finally get it, several of the holes had been the wrong size for the screws. The holes were too large or too small for the screws to go in (they either couldn't turn after a couple tries or would fall straight through). It's been a pain, but after a few trips to the hardware store, it's almost up and usable!"
3,Incomplete Grade,"I bought this CD from Amazon almost a year and a half ago. 38 tracks of which 14 were 5 seconds of blank space.I assumed it was a problem with my player until I loaned it to a friend and they had the same issue. Sad really, I plan on buying it again at some point.The Frantics are hilarious."
3,"Good story, bad printing","The plot is nice and the vintage flavor adds to its charm (you have to consider how law enforcement was in the 60's...). However the re-printing is below average with a LOT of typos, I believe they scanned the original text and used an automatic text recognition to re-write it... and the awkward format doesn't help to make the reading as enjoyable as it should be..."
1,nice if it comes unbroken,"The product itself is really nice. Good quality, but shipping is a real problem. The first time I ordered, the entire set was in pieces (many pieces) - when the replacement set came one of those was broken.Unless Amazon can figure out how to get these shipped with breakage, I would look elsewhere."
4,Kalapana,Happy with my purchase. Was hoping for a better price being that it was a used CD. It plays well.
4,Great for fans of the Bat-family!,"I agree with the above reviewer that the writing styles are inconsistent, but the stuff in the good chapters (about 80% of the book) makes it worth wading through the bad ones (only four total, I think). The chapters are all written from the point of view of different characters including Batman himself and Nightwing and Robin and even the original Batgirl, Barbara Gordon. While they're participating in the main plotline, they also reflect on their histories (I think this is Animated Series continuity) with Gotham and with each other, and some of the in-character insights are really powerful and moving (and funny!) I don't know why they decided to make a book out of a video game, but I can't imagine one being much better than this! There are some hidden treasures in here that it would be a shame to miss."
3,Too many cooks...,"This book proves the adage that too many cooks spoil the soup. While story itself is decent, the pacing is great and the story is thrilling, the major complaint about this book is that the writing style comes across as very schizophrenic and why shouldn't it? Two people with two completely different styles and writing skill collaborate when they should have run in fear at the mere thought. One can tell immediately which author wrote which section and it made the reading tiresome, annoying, and constantly jolting. Miss Grayson writes with a unique style and grace that is as identifiable as it is enjoyable. On the other hand, Mr. Dille should really stick to writing game books, grocery lists, or perhaps recipes at the very most.I give it 3 stars out of 5, but would give easily given it more if it has been written entirely by Miss Grayson. I look forward to more of her solo work"
2,Pick a Point of View and stick with it!,"I like Sun-Tzu, and I like the ultimate detective Batman is occasionally written as. This book superficially appeared as a battle of titanic deduction against titanic military cunning. That book, I wanted to read it.Instead I got one chapter, near the end. One single chapter from Batman's perspective, more a physical battle than a mental one. What a disappointment. Each chapter is from a different character's perspective, including Sin-Tzu (boo at revealing the villain's plans), henchmen, Batgirl, Alfred, Robin, and mid-boss villains like Clayface.The is genre pulp fiction, not the clash of great minds. If you are really into Batman, you'll like it. If you are expecting an intricate plot and dynamic strategic give-and-take between the Great General and the Great Detective, you'll be disappointed like me."
1,Not sturdy enough for 4 yr old,"I purchased this as a gift for my 4 yr old niece and while she asked for it and loved the idea of being able to ""pretend"" to do yard work beside her dad, it broke in a relatively short period of time. I don't think it's built with rough and tough tykes in mind. But for the $10 it entertained her for a few days."
3,"Some good remixes, but not great","There are 4 remixes of ""One By One"", including the British version [weakened considerably by uncalled for mid-song interruption by rap 'artist'[???] Mel Melle; it's very brief, but hardly painless] AND an unreleased (at least here in the US) ""I Wouldn't Treat a Dog (The Way You Treated Me)"", which is OK, but is HARDLY dance-y and sounds rather average on it's own. The rest of the remixes are pretty good indeed, though 1 of them features Cher in what can only be called a 'cameo' appearance. Good, but a disappointment and that has nothing to do with its star, who shines all the while!"
5,The Only 'One....',"I finally caved and made the purchase for this utterly fantastic set of mixes.....the various remixers have outdone themselves by breathing new life into what is already a fabulous song....Having just returned from La Cher's 'Living Proof-The Farewell Tour' at the Garden in New York, i'm literally ODing on this babes tunes.....I can't get enough and the variety of the mixes help to diversify my homemade mix cd's......The only thing separating me from Cher's Hott and very hard to believe mid-50's self was the rail in front of the stage.....I'm still reeling......This song's lyrics and danceable tune, though not sung at the show, will have me dancing in my living room for years to come.....If you love Cher.....and you boiz know who you are......you'll love this cd...I'm always skeptical about remixes but this one is Hott.....and keeps to the original feel.....adding some pump and grind.....You won't be disappointed.....She's turned back time......."
5,A fantastic drum at a fantastic price!,"This is an amazing drum for practicing and playing. It creates a great, loud sound with a lot of versatility. wonderful piece of work. I've enjoyed this drum a great deal so far and I'm very happy with my purchase."
4,A Comforting easy read.,"I felt the book was interesting and gave you some insight as to how the disciples might have been. It is a short and easy to understand book, with some lessons that could be comforting and insightful as well to the reader."
4,Lovely movie,I enjoyed the sights and sounds of this romantic movie. It's so great to see an ending where one CAN live in another's world just for the sake of love...nice sound and clear picture on the delivery as well!
3,Pretty Good,I was quite surprised at how good of a movie this was. You could sense the true chemistry with Hugh and Jessica too. It felt real.
4,The Sleeping Dictionary,"A very nice love story. Very nice performances by all actors involved. The DVD does not really offer anything to speak of in the way of extras. The movie is still well worth seeing, especially when watching with a date."
2,While You were Sleeping with the Dictionary,"Only one reason to watch THE SLEEPING DICTIONARY, a lackluster romance/1930's period piece film of forbidden love and that is the presence of Jessica Alba (IDLE HANDS,tv's DARK ANGEL). Alba shakes off her tough, DARK ANGEL persona and plays a young, sweet, soft, native girl (Selima) in Borneo hired to teach the local language to a young British Officer John Truscott (Hugh Dancy). She's placed in his residence as the hired teacher and naturally they fall in(and make)love etc. Once the film establishes this relationship, there's not much to the story as to watch people get uptight about the situation. Some good scenery and cinematography with Alba in the foreground, but there is nothing new plotwise or characterwise in this film even with the presecnce of Bob Hoskins (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABITT?)."
3,Is it really Alba?,"Well, you do get to see somebody, but I'm not sure it's Jessica Alba. The way the scenes were shot would imply a body double."
1,Really bad,"Don't know what movie the people who gave this a good review were watching. This was really sexist, racist, and boring."
4,How not to make the same mistakes your parents did,"That's really what the movie is all about. It's a love story that could have turned out just like any ""star-crossed lovers"" saga. Instead the storywriter chose to let the lovers ... not just Jessica and Hugh...but also Emily Mortimer, who plays Hugh's wife ... NOT make the same mistake their parents did. They all chose love over duty and yet they were very human and flawed as they went through the process of making that final choice. It is a well-acted story, generally, with the characters being much more complex than at first thought. I believe the story itself is the real star here."
5,NEVER HEARD OF THIS MOVIE,"This is a great film! Jessica Alba really made this movie. Her presence alone is enough to carry this story. She's a great actress and extremely beautiful. I'm surprised that she hasn't been marketed better. If you're tired of the same old stars, starring in all of the movies at the ciniplex then watch this film and keep an eye for Jessica Alba I think she's an up and coming star. She may need another manager though. There's no reason she's not being cast in blockbusters. In any case do watch this film weather you rent or buy you'll really like this movie."
1,bad,"Bad acting, predictable, one dimensional characters. More like a cartoon than a movie. Don't waste your time like I did. Difficult to say much else."
3,Watched and...Liked? Sort of?,"It was low budget, no doubt...the acting was not fabulous...yet i sat through the whole thing, my mind completely captured, especially near the end thinking "" how is this going to work out??"" Now Jessica Alba is not a serious actress, so don't expect an academy award winning performance. Hugh Dancy is fabulous because he's just so likeable and looks fantastic on film. The supporting characters were interesting and the story on the whole was different. This was a Saturday afternoon with nothing else to do kind of movie, so considering that, it was thrilling as the only option at the moment. I'm not sorry i watched it, but still shocked that i sat through it...must have been my mood."
2,I can't believe I watched the whole thing,"This could have been an excellent film, but Jessica Alba's acting was just not believable in this role. Until now, I had never seen her in a movie and had no opinion of her (good or bad). But now that I have, I'm not impressed. Hugh Dancy was good all things considered. This film had a lot of potential, and I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. Big thumbs down from me. I feel generous giving it 2 stars."
2,Fall Asleep with this 'Dictionary',"Calm down, that was a body double, ignorant goofs. An English colonial was sent to a British post in Sarawak (where in the world is that?), during the 1930's era. There ""The Sleeping Dictionary"" was assigned to him and he received the best tutoring session he ever had! Hugh Dancy played the noisy man who thought he had his morals straight, but he didn't. Good thing Jessica Alba was in this movie. She really needed to pull a ""Dark Angel"" on everyone. Even the guy from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" was insanely miscast as her father! Can you believe it? I really had high hopes for this movie, but it proved to be a huge disappointment. How shamey."
1,Drowning Without a Tsunami,"When a movie is this blatantly and irredeemably simpleminded, one has to wonder for what audience it might have been intended. The fact that Jessica Alba is adorable doesn't make up for the fact that she can't act. Any native of Sarawak who had the misfortune to see her portrayal of one of them would be offended. We know that Emily Mortimer, she's adorable too, can act from her three or four minutes on screen in ""Notting Hill""; she stole that one from a couple of much bigger stars, but you'd never know she can act from watching this. Bob Hoskins chews the scenery here to very little effect. Hugh Dancy plays a barely post-adolescent version of his character in ""The Jane Austin Book Club""; at least he's gotten much better at it. Brenda Blethyn appears disengaged thoughout; maybe it was the heat and the humidity. Once again the colonizing Brits are portrayed as arrogant racist oafs - old news.I admit that we watched it to the end - don't know why."
2,Visually Stunning but a Farce,"I was astonished to read reviews stating that this film is true to the events of the time in Sarawak, as if these reviewers took the time to look up Sarawak on the internet, they might be quite embarrassed!Sarawak was an independent state until 1941 when the Japanese invaded and did not become a British possession until 1947!This historical innacuracy annoyed me very much throughout the film, and I am stunned to read reviews PRAISING its true telling of events!For a true history, simply type Rajah Brooke or Sarawak into your search engine or email me at jasonbrooke@eircom.netGreat scenery but no more praise for historical accuracy please!"
4,Very exciting,"I loved the movie. I expected when I rented it that it would be boring but the movie surprised me. Hugh Dancy and Jessica Alba displayed major chemistry in the movie. He showed that even though he was a man he was still innocent in the way between a man and a woman and in the way the world operate. She also had moments of wonderment but mostly she showed that she had more experience than he did. She was very strong. It was a delicate balance. If the director had made the movie very raunchy or crass it would not be as appealing as it is. We know what Jessica does we do not need to have it constantly thrown in our faces. It was subtly referred to in the movie. Overall I thought that they made a very moving, romantic couple."
5,THIS MOVIE IS G-G-GREAT!!!!!,"i watched this movie because i heard about it from one of hughdancy's web sites and i wanted to see it and when i did i loved it. it's the most romantic movie i ever seen sense the blue lagoon. hugh dancy was amazing in it as john and jessica alba wasn't bad either. my favorite part is when john (hugh dancy)andjessica alba dances at the end of the movie it was so romantic, i wish i had that kind of romance. every woman should want to see this movie especially for hugh dancy he's wonderful."
1,Contrived schlock,"This pitiful excuse for vhs tape was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. Except for Bob Hoskins, I couldn't believe a word anyone mumbled in this incoherent waste of film. There's a good reason why this never made it to the theaters. Save your money. Life is too short to spend 2 hours on a concept that might have been done in 80 minutes, and even that's pushing it. I should agree that Jessica Alba is a lovely young actress, and she's nice to look at. But go to the internet and look at pictures of her instead, if that's what you fancy."
1,Are you all kidding?,"Who decided to cast Jessica Alba for this film? For those of you who admire her accent, you're way off! My mother was born in Malaysia, and there's a lot more to the accent than just broken English. Not to mention she looks nothing like the part. Did the casting director say, ""Jessica's part-Mexican, ethnic enough -- she can play a Southeast Asian!"" JA may be beautiful, but the interchanging is downright insulting, like lumping all the brown people together. Of all the ""Asian"" women in the trailer, it's so plain to see she's not! Were Asian women not attractive enough for the lead role? Are there not enough of them for a casting call, the most populous race? Actors can only ""become"" someone different to a degree. After watching the trailer, I was so disgusted I couldn't even give the movie a chance. It would only rile me up. Skip this movie, and ditch all its claims of cultural sensitivity!"
1,Sucks squared,"Stay far far away from this. I bought one, it didn't work, I returned it, they sent me a replacement. THAT didn't work. I checked reviews AFTER the fact. THEY ALL SUCK! Spend a few more bucks and get one that won't make you want to gouge out your eyes with a teaspoon. Trust me."
4,"practical, sturdy - good value","A decent value for money, serves the purpose well as a basic decanter. Very sturdy, it has slipped in the sink a few times but has never cracked or chipped.The matching funnel/filter (WMF Vino Stainless-Steel 4-Way Funnel) is a little expensive but they make a great combination!"
5,FANTASTIC!!,"This thing has changed my life. Who needs to spend a hundred bucks on a fancy crystal decanter when this does such a good job? It looks great, feels sturdy, and decants superbly. The width is perfect for a regular bottle of wine (i.e. maximum surface area is reached when a full bottle is poured).What has amazed me is that even cheap bottles of wine ""open up"" and taste so much more rich and full-bodied (and less acidic) after you decant them for ten minutes. I use this every night to decant every and any red wine I buy. It's changed my life. A terrific product!"
3,Good for the price,"First of all, do read the editorial review carefully. The decanter is not supposed to be made of glass. On the other hand, it does ""look like glass, sounds like glass."" Pouring is fairly simple and non-messy, but I believe a bevelled/thinner edge could make it better. Overall, it is adequate as a casual decanter."
5,School Library Journal says:,"""Since pain is an integral part of life, the author encourages teens to consider meditation -- conscious attention to what is going on in the brain -- as the most healt6hy antidote...time tested meditation techniques -- from simple breathing exercies to active yoga and martial-arts forms...constructive means for dealing with negative emotions and challenges, including words of widom from Eastern and Western philosophers and religious teachers....Much good adivce is contained in these pages...resources, pictures."""
4,"fascinating, at times beautifully written","The Third Pandemic is a novel about the current emergence of antibiotic-resistent bacteria. I've read several books of this genre, and this is certainly one of the best. The book is at times very well written. Noteworthy is that the author employs bizzare kind literary egalitarianism as an interesting literary device: Disease is narated by ALL its participants -- bacteria living in meat, a fly landing on the infected meat and contracting he disease, an infected mouse biting on a person, that person sleeping with someone else and infecting her, etc.This is not Camus' The Plague; If the author had some profound message to share with his readers, he sure didn't develop it here, but it is a nice and interesting novel nevertheless."
3,Never Fleshed Out,"I work in the medical field and snapped up this book to read. While it was an oK book, it flat lined on substance. It was bogged down in details on how the bug spread and the characters were spread too thin."
5,Entertaining and very thought-provoking,"This is my favorite science fiction suspense novel. (Yes, even better than the Michael Crichton novels I love so much.) It is well-written and weaves together a number of riveting plot lines.What I loved the most is the chilling possibility -- quite realistic -- of the premise ... that a superbug could spread havoc on humanity. Although this possible future is different from the one proposed in the movie The Matrix, it is equally compelling and thought-provoking. Not only did this book entertain me thoroughly, but it has kept me thinking. Bravo!...."
1,Worst Blu-ray (and/or DVD) movie I own,"I totally agree with John Craig. The acting is poor, and there is no storyline. The hand-held camera makes you dizzy and the picture quality is amateur/Super 8 mm at best. Why the movie had to come out on Blu-ray is a mystery.Furthermore there is no thematic concept, and the movie wavers between social realist drama and reality TV type documentary, and one wonders, what they are trying to show/tell us. A dismal screenplay is not really helped by a constant voice-over narration.Why the jury at the Berlin Film Festival gave this unintelligent, uninspired movie the grand prize can only be explained -- if it wasn't for political correctedness reasons -- when you believe them to be all blind.If you like this kind of movie watch (or buy) CITY OF GOD or PERRO COME PERRODO NOT spend money on ELITE SQUAD."
1,Elite Squad not so Elite,"this movie was poorly acted and no storyline. The only thing exciting was the gun play in the opening scene. If you seen ""City of God"" this is not the same movie! Disregard movie at all cost aint worth its cost."
1,Pretty pathetic for an Elite Squad,"By modern day standards, this squad has low-tech weapons and tactics. I mean even American SWAT teams at this time had better armor, weapons and tactics.Maybe because this was a low budget film they couldn't afford newer weapons and options that are standard equipment on even the poorest US SWAT teams. Their assault tactics looked elementary; such as maneuvering in bright lights instead of dim; bunching up in alleys, running into a situation without enough ammo, etc. Plus, no reflex sights, no night scopes, Kevlar helmets, comm VOX headsets.In one scene one of heir ""Elites"" is racking and dry-firing his Glock, and then pointing it at his buddy, which was really stupid and psychotic. Training - okay. Execution - lousy. No Elites; just a bunch of clowns. Oh, they looked pretty effective shooting and torturing suspects; which I'm sure a lot of American police depts would love to do without any repercussions."
5,best in portuguese but still an awesome movie,"I usually don't like violent action movies but this has made it to my top 10 favorite movies of all times.Wagner Moura is constantly talking (non stop!) in the background and I can see how that can get really annoying when you're reading subtitles as it can become hard to keep up.. This is more so because the subtitles aren't color coordinated, making it difficult to identify who is saying what. A lot of people complain that there is too much talking, making this feel more like a documentary than an action movie. I disagree. I think that although the story line may not be that complicated, the message and the emotion this movie is trying to convey is complex and cannot be manifested without the narration in the background. The only way this movie is similar to a documentary is that, sadly, most of it is actually the reality of Rio de Janeiro.captain nascimento is so badass!"
3,Watch the disc region,"The movie is great, the picture and sound are very good, but should take care when purchasing this film, but the blu ray disc's region is region B and will not run on blu ray players in Brazil, the United States and several other countries."
4,Best action police movie I have ssen,"This movie makes any Samuel L. Jackson movie seem like a chick flick. Awesome gun fights and a great plot full of surprises. Really depicts the everyday life o the members of the elite squad. Lots of strong content, you might wanna consider watching this without any kids around."
3,a change of cloths,"It is harder to use for the youger little mom,there is two sippers to close the bag.Needed to have more room for baby stuff in side"
4,One of Ms. Stanwyck's Best,"I vaguely remember seeing this movie as a child around 50 years ago. It is definitely one of those movies you won't want to interrupt from beginning to end. I found Barbara Stanwyck's co-stars' performances to be just so-so, but she makes up for it. The sound & picture quality is good, not great. I would have wanted closed captions for my rather old hearing."
3,no man of her own,I was really looking forward to watching this film again after many years but unfortunately the dvd kept stopping constantly. I hope I can get a replacement copy.
4,High Society,This was a very straight forward book perhaps stating what we already might know about drug usage but still refusing to consider the problem as VERY serious. The statistics given in the book really bring a better perspective and the wide range of drug usage is clearly shown. The one section that dealt with marijuana was worth devoting an entire chapter on the subject. A very good book and easy to understand. Excellent for parents to use to help with the decisions that their children might someday have to face.
3,Incompatible with T-Mobile SDA,"This headphone turned out to incompatible with my T-Mobile SDA. Problems were related to music playing mono instead of stereo and whenever I receive a call, I can hear the other person, but they cannot hear me. If it weren't for those issues, I would give this product 5 stars because it is very comfortable in the ears and did not experience any pain in the ear like I did with the original headphones."
4,Great introduction to JMS,"""JMS is a Java Application Programming Interface (API), which allows software applications, components, and objects to create, send, receive, and read messages"". The author starts with an introduction to J2EE, and explains where JMS fit in this technology. Then he gives an introduction to message service, and finally the Java message service. The first three chapters introduce J2EE. EJB(the heart of Java Enterprise technology), session beans, entity beans, and how to reach a session bean and an entity bean as a web client are also discussed. The second section of the book (chapters 4, 5, 6) gives an introduction to message service, MOM, TPM, RPC, ORB.. And finally chapters 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 discuss Java Message Service. Every section of the book is accompanied by examples and applications.This book targets Java application developers. Although programming experience is assumed, the first 3 intro chapters will give you the details you need."
2,Fun but junky!,"This is a fun game but there is no on or off switch on the phone. You have take the batteries out when done playing or else it will keep talking. It's not made very good. Save your money and buy Girl Talk, it's a better game."
2,Don't waste your money!,My daughter wanted this game for Christmas so I bought it for her and wish that I would've saved my time because it went back to the store! The telephone worked for about 2 minutes tops and then became distorted. I changed the batteries and it still didn't work right. Maybe you will have better luck but I'm not going to buy it again.
2,Not durable at all,It would have been a good game but the phone stopped working almost immediately. It's been a while since I did my Christmas shopping so who knows where the receipt is but it was so annoying to have the game break that fast. My daughter was so upset.
4,Correcting Label mis-infortmation,"According to the label, this is a reissue of his ""first commercially available album"" (which would be ""Negro Sinful Songs,"" released in 1939). They also claim that most of these tracks were recorded ""in the New York studios of Musicraft Records in 1939."" As far as I can tell, neither statement is true! First, the track list is entirely different from ""Negro Sinful Songs."" More importantly, the liner notes give us contrary recording dates of August of 1943, February 17, 1944, and April 19, 1944 (a full four to five years after his first album came out!)[...]This was my first Lead Belly album, and it certainly isn't a bad place to start. Just beware what you're actually purchasing. Misinformation like this is why it's so hard to know which CDs of Lead Belly's music to buy so you don't end up with twelve copies of the exact same recording sessions.-Devin."
5,"Great Quality, No Frills","Very basic piece, but very well made, with good weight, balance and finish. Very pleased with the quality and at the price an exceptional value."
4,"Great product, multi-purpose!",They have a classic look and are perfect for mini-souffles. They can also be used to serve nuts and candies or for sauces and dressings. I love them!
4,Souffle Dish,"I haven't actually cooked with it yet, but I can say that it is very heavy and has very thick sides. The weight makes it difficult to store (I live in a small apartment, so everything is stacked in my cupboards!). It does make for a chic fruit bowl though!"
5,A Good Beginning,Down's Economic Theory of Democracy is an easy to read introdution to the basics of voting theory. It is accessible to the casual reader as well as the hardcore acedemic. It's take on the electoral competition have become staples of high school civis as well as acedemic political theory.Down's most famous innovation is the result that two party competition leads to both parties offering the same platform in order to maximise votes.0-----25-----50-----75----100 ----------Rep--Dem-----------This formulation is actually the Hotelling spatial competition model applied to elections. (I thought the economists may be interested!) Morover it froms the basis fro the median voter theorem.
5,The most misunderstood book in political science,"An Economic Theory of Democracy is among the most influential books in political science. It is also among the most misunderstood. The book has 300 pages of content. The famous median voter theorem represents three of them. The remaining 297 pages involve extensions, limitations and generalizations -- exactly the sort of thing that most critics think it lacks. In the end, the book is really about the problems of limited information rather than about a unidimensional spatial model."
3,Fascinating in its own right...,"While ""The Legend of The Painted Horse"" is not on the lofty levels of ""Brules"" and ""The Scout"", I don't think it was ever intended to be. Nonetheless, I'll always remember exactly where I was (at rhe gym) and exactly what I was doing (riding a stationary bike) when Combs tied together all the elements of the Brules story. I was emotionally overwhelmed. A fabulously romantic ending to an incredible story. I thought the painted horse history was pretty cool, too. The entire Brules saga is one of the best reads in my well read life. Tolkein, Mary Stewart, Roger Zelazny, Edgar Rice Burroughs, for me, Combs belongs among them."
2,Style by Ralph Lauren,I ordered 2 bottles of the perfume and I only received one. I don't know where to call or who to contact in order to follow up with this order. The perfumes were received in a plastic wrap versus the original box and I don't recall that being specified on the description of the advertising. Please let me know how to obtain the second bottle or a refund. Thank you
3,Thomasine & Bushrod DVD,"Thomasine & Bushrod (1974)Max ""The Mack"" Julien and Vonetta McGee did very well in this 1970s Western version of Bonnie & Clyde."
3,It's Bonney and Clyde...dipped in chocolate.,"One of the rarer seen movies of the blaxploitation era starring Max Julien in his follow up to ""The Mack"",as an outlaw in the old wild west circa 1910 who meets and falls in love with Vonette Mcgee's character, Thomasine and become the Bonney and Clyde of their time...This can't end well.also features a young(early 20s) Glenn Turman, and black film veteran Juanita Moore."
3,Nice decanter but recommend WMF Easy Pour,"I purchased this decanter and it was nice, I liked it, and had no complaints. However, I ordered a WMF Easy Pour decanter as a gift for a friend and liked it MUCH better. The narrower neck on the Easy Pour made pouring easier (as the name states!) I also thought the Easy Pour looked more elegent. I still have my Captain's decanter and use it, but I bought an Easy Pour for myself."
1,Impossible to review,"I cannot comment on the product itself because apparently it is not available for sale although it is listed as such. Availability of the item is so intrinsically tied to its value to a customer that it is inappropriate to exclude comments related to such. Although I ordered the item on December 10th as a Christmas present, it has yet to ship, no reason is given, and now the estimated delivery date is Feb 14-21- great product, right?"
3,Less Salsa then I wanted.,Less Salsa then I wanted.Most of the song weren't Tito's. I only buy Tito’s music because I love the Timbales. Not enough Timbales.
1,Worst BluRay ever,"Canadian Blu Rays DVD's are almost by definition bad.This Blu Ray went a bit further and it's even worse tha bad, it's pittiful.No subtitles in ANY language, bad transfe, the DVD has more video quality, audio quality and xtras than the poor BluRay.From a 300 BluRay library I own, this is by far the worst BluRay I own. I wish Amazon.com would stop selling Canadian BLURAYs.Seriously the DVD is way better, I own it too."
1,"Cute Actors, but HORRIBLE MOVIE!!","The actors in the movie are really cute, but it's not worth the torture of sitting through an hour and a half of bad plots and even worse lines. I never knew a movie could be this bad and still attract ""big-name"" actors. The only plus (other than the actors) is that it's a great movie to MAKE FUN of...I've never seen this bad of a representation of the Mafia!!"
5,Physco,"I loved this film...especially when Taylo{Diesel} kicks the junk outta the bouncer. When matty, in the end shoots Teddy{Malkovich} is awesome too. I fyou looking for a great movie, then c thiss....""Getting the bag involves some gunshots, getting cut, and getting brutally beaten...TWO THUMBS WAY UP..."""
3,OK Movie,"I was expecting this to be pretty bad. It wasn't. It wasn't very good either. The story, the pacing and for the most part, the acting (especially Pepper, who was excellent) was good, and it's fairly beleivable. Malkovich is hamming it up as usual, a few of the characters are poorly written, it is in serious need of a good soundtrack, and it's predictable. It ain't Goodfella's, but it's not as bad as the critics would have you believe either."
5,Good Movie,"My husband picked this movie and he always picks the best movies but I was not sure that I liked Vin Diesel so much, then I saw this and changed my mind. I could not even blink it was so exciting."
2,Sons of The Sopranos,The casting was great and the story of sons of mobsters trying to make a name for themselves is a interesting concept. The concept of the movie was great but the movie fell trap to a plot-driven movie instead playing their strength of the cast to a charactor-driven story. To me this movie had the potential to be a great movie but it failed to trust their material.
4,"perfect movie, with a perfect cast, new or old","knockaround guys is a perfect movie, with a perfect acast, new or old. teh really good performaces were of Vin Diesel and Barry Pepper and I think they could of let Seth Green have a good part but thats my opinion. Its just about kids and their fathers and growing up into the world around them. Seth Green( Johnny Marble) loses a bag and him Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper and Andrew Davoli have to find it before Deniis Hopper and John Malkovich do something to them.it starts off good and ends good. shootout in the end is a real let down though, but afterall its a great flick and I enjoyed it in the theaters and I bought it and I think anyone should buy it if htey are fans of the stars"
4,Nice,"The Knockaround Guys is the story of a young man's quest for approval from his father and the discovery of lifelong betrayal by his uncle. The son of a mobster, who cannot find legitimate work because of familial ties, decides to become involved in organized crime by helping his father with an important delivery. The mission fails when the key player makes a serious error in judgment and loses the package he was to deliver in a small town in the middle of nowhere. During the process of retrieving the package, people die and truths come to the surface.I bought this dvd primarily to see Vin Diesel. His portrayal of a Italian/Jewish thug was very convincing. This movie was well cast. It's not a fast paced action movie but, still entertaining. I always enjoy the directors' comments. They add depth and understanding to the picture."
3,Good but...,I bought this movie because Vin is in it. That being said I don't know that I would want to watch it again if he wasn't. It was good for what it was but it wasn't an Oscar winner. The characters were the same ones you would find in any other mob movie but forced and stale. Of course as long as you don't go into this expecting The Godfather (or even TG III) you should enjoy it.
4,Average movie.,"This is an average movie. Its okay, if you need some good entertainment, get this movie because its good. 7.5/10"
5,The Sopranos meet goodfellas,"Knockaround Guys, which is a smart movie about dumb guys: four pampered mobster sons desperate to prove themselves The film begins slowly, as yet another telling of the mob son trying to live up to his father's expectations. Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan) the son of Brooklyn gangster Benny Chains (Dennis Hopper) His father doesn't respect him, and neither does his Uncle Teddy (John Malkovich) because he failed a test of family honour at age 13. But Matty can't get a respectable job outside the mob, because the family name is feared. This is a fun summer gangster movie There are lots of elements that are retreads from other gangster films, but enough surprises and talented actors who manage to make it fresh"
1,Annoying,"I could not make it through the first half an hour with out quitting. I'm sorry but if your gonna use a real town, film in the actual town. Wibaux is not big enough to have an airport let alone all the buildings that were shown in the movie, plus we do drive new cars in Montana, I'm not originally from this area but I hate it when you people assume we are stuck back in the fifties. Needless to say this movie sucked. I wouldn't even bother watching it for free."
1,"PONDEROUS, UNWATCHABLE DISENTERTAINMENT","It is inconceivable to me that our native criminals, our Organized Crime families, could be that stupid; they wouldn't be able to feed themselves. It would take them weeks to figure out Calzone.Diesel, you don't want to go back to bouncing, do you? If you don't cut this out you won't have any career left."
4,Good condition,"I would order again form this seller. DVD arrived fast and in good condition. Movie was ok, kept my interest for a while...then it got kind of predictable, like every other mafia movie; which make Italians look like dumb thugs!"
4,Great Vin Diesel Movie,"This is a very good all around action movie. This is the first time I ever heard of Vin Diesel, I thought he was fantastic. Does anyone know the name of the song that is playing then the one guy that is playing pool, is taken outside and shot by the two mobster guys?? The first words of the song is ""When shadows are fallin"" If anyone can help please e-mail me sswaney@uusd.net"
4,"Great dish, but lid doesn't fit","The price can't be beat on this item and I love the actual dish. However, the lid doesn't make a seal with the dish, and leaves gaps in between the lid and the dish. I'm going to keep it anyway, cause its not a huge deal for my purposes/the price but it is annoying. Why can't they make the lid line up to the dish...shouldn't be too difficult. I guess that's what you can expect for $12."
2,THE LID DOES NOT FIT!,Very disappointing. The lid does not begin to fit. Will not keep moisture in or stuff out. It is not usable for baking or storing food in frig or taking food to potluck.
5,Every Single Guy (and Gal) Needs One...,"This covered bowl is ideal for microwaving soups and leftovers for 1 or 2 people. The lid keeps contents from splattering all over the microwave and keeps heat in to reduce actual heating time. It also stays relatively cool to touch and is much better than microwaving in the bowl you're going to eat from.Graduate up from heating foods in plastic containers or old soup bowls; with proper care, this can last a long time and you'll feel like a grown up. Every kitchen should have one."
5,A must have for any kitchen,"If, like me, you like making food with the intention to have some leftovers, this is a must. Works equally well in the oven or the microwave. I've got two of them now, and would be lost without them."
5,Thanks Pyrex,"With all the companies that feel compelled to go to ""new and improved"" I am quite grateful to Pyrex for maintaining the quality standards they have had for decades. Some of my Pyrex dates to the 70s and I have a rather large collection as I am continually having to loan some of it to friends and neighbors. You just can't go wrong with Pyrex."
2,Poorly Fitting Lids,"I understand that these are now made by a different company, which may explain why the lids fit so poorly. The last set I purchased 25 years ago had nice glass lids that fit very closely. This set has lids that fit so poorly there is real risk of them falling off while you are carrying them."
1,Disappointed!,I have a number of dishes by Pyrex and this is the first one I regret purchasing. The lid does not fit securely. The performance in the mircrowave is disappointing for most dishes especially veggies.
1,WORST PRODUCT FROM PYREX,VERY POORLY MADE FLIMSY ...NOT A GOOD PRODUCT TO USE IN OVEN ... DIDN'T TAKE A CHANCE TO USE IN MICROWAVE OR OVEN -- USE JUST TO SERVE POPCORN OR FRUITS ...
1,Beware: this product may explode!,"A week ago, I would have given this product a 4 or 5 star rating. Since then, it exploded, sending glass shrapnel all over my kitchen.Until I sat down and googled ""pyrex explosion"" I didn't realize this is not an uncommon occurence. I used this dish for years. It's versatile, shows off food, and is simple to clean. However, you might consider investing in some safety glasses because it can explode like a bomb with no warning whatsoever."
5,The perfect size,Perfect size for casseroles. 1 1/2 qt is too small; 2 1/2 qt is too big. This is the perfect size. And nothing bakes like Pyrex.
4,Good movie but I wish the story went further,"This is a great movie that actually features the Dorsey's themselves. The movie tells the story of Jimmie and Tommy Dorsey growing up and their start to the music business. The story is good and the music is, of course, great. My only complaint is that I wish the story would have featured more about their career and less about how the two couldn't get along and so they went their separate ways until their father died when they made up. It's still a good movie and I do recommend it but if you're like me in wanting to learn more about the career you might actually prefer The Glenn Miller story."
3,Fabulous Dorseys,"This is not a great movie, but if you like the music from the 30s & 40s it's nice to see the original artists perform."
4,Great material,"I had to purchase this book for a class, but I was very impressed with the approachable way in which the material was presented. Unlike most of my books, this one is sticking around as a reference."
4,Better than the Original.,"After when Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) finds back his memory from the end of the first film. When an mysterious nanny (Joan Cusack) comes into the lives of the Addams Family. When Mortica (Angelina Huston) and Gomez (Raul Julia) has thier thrid child. When Wesnesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugisy (Jimmy Workman) wants to get rib of thier new born baby brother. While the childern are sent to Summer Camp. When the nanny used Uncle Fester to marry him and kill him for his money. But she is having a hard time to kill Uncle Fester.This film feature a over the top Comic Performance by Cusack and Ricci, which they steal every scene, when they are On-Screen. One of the most underrated films of 1993. One of the best Comic Sequel around too. Director:Barry Sonnerfield (The Addams Family, Men in Black 1 & 2) give a better engery in this one than the Original. Grade:A-."
2,"Better than the Original, and That's It.","Viewed: 1/13Rate: 31/13: Slightly better than the original, Addams Family Values still retains characters that I cannot stand. And this time, they've decided to add another actress that I've hated for years: Joan Cusack. Since Addams Family Values is meant to be a film for kids, Joan Cusack's cleavage is at a full-front assault in every scene she appears in. Admittedly, Addams Family Values has many clever ideas and is a way better film than whatever the crap Tim Burton could come up with. All in all, only if I could stand the characters, Addams Family Values might have worked out better for me, but it has racist undertones."
1,Terrible.,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is weak, ""Debbie"" is a ridiculous character, and the movie is all together boring. I've wasted two hours of my life that I can never get back."
4,Addams Family Values DVD,"I got this dvd because I already had the first addams family dvd and I liked that movie so I wanted to complete the collection. It's an ok movie, pretty silly and stupid but funny and entertaining enough to keep. I wouldn't recommend it as the best movie ever, but it's good to watch as a sequel. Still, all in all, glad I have it now. And the price was pretty decent."
4,Good Halloween movie for the whole family,I have liked this movie since I was little so it was nice to show it to my kids. There are a couple of adult jokes but they went right over my kids heads.
3,family fun,This movie is good family fun for kids over 5. Not as good as the original movie and certinaly not as good as the TV show. But good enough to entertain the kids
2,Charming Addams style foregone for dumbness,"I always liked the Addams family TV show -- they were indeed ""mysterious and kooky,"" but ever so charming. This movie falls more heavily on the side of dumb sight gags and one-liners which leave very little to laugh at. If it were not for the cooly creepy performance of ""Wednesday"" this would have gotten zero stars."
3,"Solid, though not as good","This 2nd film is a solid outing, but it falls short of the first in many areas. Certainly worth seeing, but nothing to rush out and buy."
2,"partley O.K, Could have been much better, thogh!","Warning: this is NOT a kid's movie!That is disapointing, as the T.V series, and even the first movie were made partley for children.this movie was way too wierd, freaky and bizzare, and before you say ""It's supposed to be"", try to understand me.True, The Addams Family is known for being weired and bizzare, but the T.V series and the first movie were weired, bizzare and creapy in a CHILD-FRIENDLY way, this movie WAS NOT!I did like the new baby in this movie who is verry funny, and an exallant new addition to this unique family of charitors, but as for the rest of the story.. well, all I can say is it's way too freaky to even discribe!"
2,DON'T EVEN BOTHER,THIS MOVIE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ADAMS FAMILY TV SHOW. NO STYLE JUSTA BUNCH OF KNOCK OFF FROM THE ORIGIN GREAT SHOW. UTTER BLAH.
2,Pretty bad,"Yeah it was pretty terrible. However I found myself going back to it in the library video section just to see how bad it was again. So it can't be all THAT horrible. Entertaining because of the Addams draw that pulls everyone to it, comical and still somewhat dark, but not like the first.OH and what is that classical piece that Debbie is playing on the radio in her hand before she throws it into the tub with fester? I thought it was called Dance of the Polynesians, however I can't find it."
5,The Addams Family 2,"Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and Gomez (Raul Julia) have a new baby - Pubert. But Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) are Addamses, so they start trying to kill their new brother. Their parents hire a nanny for them - Debbie Jilinsky (Joan Cusack). But she's not a nanny; she has killed a few rich husbands to get their money. But now the money is over, she sends Wednesday and Pugsley to summer camp and marries Fester (Christopher Lloyd) to get his fortune. But killing an Addams is too difficult...The movie is fantastic, but in my opinion the 1st part was much better.The actors are really wonderful, especially Anjelica Huston as Morticia, Raul Julia as Gomez and Christopher Lloyd as Fester. Christina Ricci also made a very outstanding performance as Wednesday.The rest of cast:Dana Ivey as MargaretCarel Struycken as LurchCarol Kane as GrandmaJohn Franklin as Cousin IttJimmy Workman as Pugsley AddamsChristopher Hart as Thing"
1,"Weak story, and lacks the laughs of the original.",That says it all. This movie lacked the charm and comedy of the original movie. It ran out of steam about two minutes into the movie. Stick with the original movie instead.
1,Horrible! Carolyn Jones is spinning in her grave!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a hideous, terrible represtention of the classic TV show. I couldn't watch the entire thing. It was crude, scary, and disgusting. I cant beileve they acutally made this movie. A stain on Angelica Houston's and Christopher Lloyd;s record. If I could give this movie no stars I would."
4,warped but wonderful,"if you're a little warped and have a dark sense of humor this movie's for you.I love Anjelica Houston as Morticia ,she's a scream!!!!!"
5,"As good, if not better than the series.",A winner of a sequel. Carries on the tradition of the original series with spectacular acting and a great story line. Had Raul Julia livied there would have been more installments of these great movies.
4,hey the addams are khool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i'm twelve years old and i love Mrs.Huston which is Anjelica,in this movie.i know this movie by heart i've seen it so much.in the beginning Morticia announces she is going to have a baby like now and the family rushes to the hospital.if you haven't seen the first movie then this won't make any sense atall to you.at the end of the first movie Morticia tells Gomez that she is pregnant and then they start kissing and bla,bla,bla.they are so into each other.anyways the second movie.Morticia has the baby and the baby's name is Pubert.he looks acactully like Gomez.later Morticia and Gomez talk about having a nanny around the house because Wednesday and Pugsley are not to happy about the new baby.they find the perfect nanny...or do they?the nanny sends the kids off to camp and she tries to savatage the family.it's a great movie you should see it!!!!!!!marlena.grooms@sbcglobal.net"
4,Good movie....in my p.o.v.,"One great movie. I like the play scene where Wednesday and her ""Outcast"" group do their dirty thing to destroy the camp itself. That's the part in the movie that I like...Wednesday's adlib to the play is off the hook. Amanda Buckman (the girl scout cookie seller from the previous movie) and the two hyper counselors deserved what Wednesday and her ""outcast"" group did (threatening to burn Amanda on stake, and roasting two counselors on open fire); What if these two things were switched? If it did, it wouldn't be PG-13..."
5,christina ricci roxx in this movie!!,"this movie is just as good as the prequel. christina ricci (however) steals the show (again). her supreb acting as wednesday completely blew my soxx off. fester goes and gets married, mrticia and gomez have to deal with a new baby, and wednesday and pugsley get sent off to the horrors of horros...SUMMER CAMP!! who would want to be out in the fresh air and sunshine with a bunch of snobby kids? the only good thing is that wednesday finds love there. oh-lala!! won't give out anymore info, you'll have to see the movie for yourself. and see the first one too!!"
5,Must reading for every member of the Church of Christ.,"John Carroll Brown's book, Beyond the Silence, shows every member of the Church of Christ how they can personally interpret scripture without relying upon the traditional application of inferences and examples that are subject to private interpretation. This is MUST reading for those who want to escape the divisiveness caused by faulty traditional methods of interpretation and enjoy the rich blessings of freedom and unity in Christ Jesus."
4,Beyond the Silence is freeing,"John Brown is very well versed in ""Church of Christisms"" and presents his excellent study of the arguments which he used for years in support of the authority of Biblical silence. Brown now exposes the hidden flaws of the arguements supporting the widely accepted Church of Christ hermaneutic of the authority of silence and gives convincing evidence that Biblical Silence is mythological and proves nothing."
1,Me arrepiento de la compra,La verdad es que me arrepiento de esta compra. No estoy conforme con la calidad de los accesorios.La caja estaba en mal estado. Las pilas estaban dañadas.Aparentemente el vendedor tenia mucho tiempo con este producto guardado.
3,"This may be for you, or it may not.","The key item in this set is the camera bag. It is a two pouch affair with a divider for the main pouch. The larger one is 5.5""x5.5""x2.5"". The smaller front pouch is 1""x4""x5.5"". This is an over the shoulder bag for camera and accessories. If you are looking for a tiny protective case for a typical small digital point & shoot, this isn't it.The accessories are bare minimum. The batteries (2) are 2000 mAh, not the more typical 2500 mAh; sub-standard capacity. The charger is an ""overnight"" charger - 16 hours to charge. The good part is that it is gentle on the batteries. It could cramp your style if you are traveling and don't have 16 hours in one place to charge the batteries. I haven't tried the screen protectors, so I won't comment.In summary, if what is in this kit is what you are looking for, it is a good deal and well made. If not, don't waste your money."
5,Music to me ears!,"Imagine hearing the soft ballads of John Lennon & Paul McCartney for the first time. This is what you'll get with Keane. I can have their CD playing all day long and it is beautiful, relaxing. Nice music to listen to while making love. Actually took my headache away the other day; I've never had music do that before. I am 39 years old & a married female."
4,Eddie and the No Name Gang: Running with the Reservoir Pups,"Molly's ReviewsThe ReviewIrish writer Colin Bateman presents an exhilarative, spine tingling work filled with all the zestful agitation, whimsical cast of characters and explosive tension necessary to hold the target audience absorbed from beginning paragraph to ending lines. Eddie & the Gang with No Name: Running with the Reservoir Pups is a well-written publication filled with generously drawn players and a cleverly interwoven, precarious story line. The setting for the book is England, and some of the language used will have an English flavor which kids will find intriguing.Enjoyed the read, happy to recommend.Reviewed by: molly martin20+ years California classroom teacher"
4,Many faces....,"The book is full of many different French Bull dogs. Great picture book for the Frenchie lover. I was really looking for a book with a bit more bite, but really enjoyed the pics."
5,frenchie kiss is so cute,"I have a frenchie bulldog and got this book. It was even better then I thought except for people saying its a coffee table book. Its 12 by 12, Thats a small coffee table. But the book has cute pictures of frenchies on each page ,Plus cute little sayings. Well worth the price"
4,Nice travel assistant,"Thin, cover is about paperback sized and is about 1/2 inch thick. Easy for carrying in a bag. Phrases included are pretty useful, though with all travel phrase books there will be phrases missing and phrases you don't use. It's very thorough, and includes pronunciation. Some of the bonus facts are a bit off, and at least one is definitely wrong (it states that US cell phones cannot ever be used in Europe, which is incorrect as many new cell phones are dual or tri band these days, and those most definitely can be used overseas). I'd still recommend buying this book, just take facts with a grain of salt and do your travel homework elsewhere."
3,Kindle Edition lacking,"Seems useful and gets started very quickly. In the Kindle edition, the tables, which contain most of the useful phrases, are included as images. They are difficult to read and impossible to search."
2,If you are looking for any depth - go elsewhere,"As a second generation Irish-American Catholic, I hoped to find a good story wrapped within the unique Irish-American perspective of life. However, I was very disappointed for the following reasons: 1) the story was too simplistic (and full of tired cliches), 2) the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes and 3) the main characters (and their family) were claustrophobic in their smug superiority. I have seen too many families that present just this outward image while hiding a truth that would be more beneficial for all to see the light of day. Isn't it ironic now that the theme of the distorted family image of the O'Sulivan family is in fact duplicated by the depiction of the Coyne/McGrail clan.Surely I won't be coming back for a second helping."
5,"Many ""big names"" in infosec give this a 5 and they're right!","I am fortunate to have an autographed copy from when Mr. Skoudis taught a SANS class I attended; and have had to take a lot of time getting it read in the meantime. This is the book that I would recommend to anyone that would learn the workings of worm, virus, trojan horse and other malware - not how to write them, but how to understand and deal with them. The information on setting up a lab to examine these critters is a good start for those wanting to understand attacks - but like other reviewers have said, this book is not for one without a grounding in computer security."
5,Better than the Original!,I would say that in most cases remakes are not as good as the original but in this case I have seen them both and must say that Julia and Harrison make a great pair!
2,A disappointing remake. I prefer the original with Hepburn,"A disappointing remake. I prefer the original with Hepburn.Story was not much to begin with, but Hepburn's charm made it enjoyable if predictable tale.The remake uses a homely looking woman, so there is no charm to save the thing."
4,A Timeless Storyline,"Julia Ormond and Harrison Ford struggles to keep this sub-par remake alive. They--especially Julia--succeeds in bringing forth this great story. A great love story, the movie captures the evolution of savior: ""Sabrina Fair"" whose warmth and compassion changes the lives of everyone around her.On the other hand, the romantic chemistry between Ormond and Ford leaves much to be desired, especially for a romantic film and the nouveau riche ambience is a tad over-done and detracts from the main plot.However, this remains one of my favorite films and doesn't fail to be moving."
4,"Hate me, but this is better than the Hepburn version","Most crtics would disagree with me, but I liked this movie far better than the Bogart/Hepburn version. I love Harrison Ford--he's very sexy and I never thought Bogie was even attractive, much less sexy and I'm 58 years old. Julia Ormond is also far prettier than Audrey Hepburn. I liked Hepburn, she was just way too fragile looking. It was always hard for me to see her as an adult. In this remake, Linus'(Harrison Ford) transformation from total workaholic to a man who understood the need to LIVE was gradual and believable. I saw little, if any, difference in the character as played by Bogart. And Julia Ormond's Sabrina went convincingly from awkward teen with a major crush on the younger brother (SPOILER ALERT) to sophisticated adult who discovers real love with the older brother, Linus. I absolutely loved the ending. Highly recommended."
4,A good remake,"Other than the fact that it seemed like Linus and Sabrina fell in love quickly (two-three days?) I found this to be a charming remaking. The first act seemed or felt rather long-watching her in Paris while she slowly tried to forget about David. I did wonder whatever happened to her photographer boyfriend-but I guess he was just meant to be a fling. Plus, I would have liked this modernized version to give her father more of a backbone other than just letting whatever happen-happen. Plus, Sabrina was supposed to be like this innocent breath of fresh air-chick who was steadily pursuing an engaged man. I questioned her intelligence to willing line up to be one of those love him and dump chicks David ran through. If she knew him as well as she said she did, why follow his blueprint to a broken heart? Still it's a charming film-a good remake-not great-but good."
1,NO COMPARISON TO THE OLD VERSION!!!,"If you ever liked the old version with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, don't even look at this one! The comparison to Bogart to Ford is zip, nada, nothing!!! The wonderful music from the old Sabrina didn't appear in this one... they barely put in ""La Vie en Rose"" one of the most romatic songs from the old version! I guess I'm too much of a Bogart fan to allow any man to take his place. Harrison Ford, I think, was much past his prime in this movie... And nobody can say the wonderful lines Boggy did... ""It's all in the family""... Whenever Ford said all the lines, they just fell flat. Anyway... If you liked the old one, don't watch this one! I guess if you are a great fan of Ford you might enjoy it, but other than that, I don't think anyone can compare to Bogart, Hepburn, and Holden! Watch the OLD one! NOT the new!!! I promise you'll enjoy the old one much better!"
1,How Come I'm the Only Person who Hated this Movie?,"I like most movies, and don't tend to be picky, but...why did they even bother to remake the original? Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart certainly don't need updated versions. Julia Ormond is lovely, but she cannot act. Perhaps the director knew this; there are about a million close-ups of her face, with no dialogue. But a lot of people seemed to love this movie, so maybe I missed something. I can't imagine what."
2,BORING!!,"How anyone could rate this movie higher than a 2 is beyond me...and a 2 is being generous! I guess it would be okay if you had never seen the original Bogart/Hepburn version, but once you've seen the original this one pales sorely in comparison!! There is no spark between Ormond and Harrison, and you can barely even understand some of her lines! Be smart...get the original and you'll be hooked...get this version and get ready for a nap!"
1,Beyond horrible,"I must ask what the crew was thinking when they decided to remake a classic. Honestly, how can you ever try to redo a film as great as the original Sabrina? It is nearly impossible. This version has such a horrible actess portraying Sabrina. It is an insult to Audrey Hepburn! To have someone that can't act and isn't at all attractive play a role you once played? The horror! I just can't believe they actually remade such a masterpiece."
1,Horrid,"This movie is a terrible remake of a wonderful movie (the original, with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite movies). The acting was wooden and the updated situations and dialogues NO improvement on the original. I had been excited to see this, actually, since I've always liked Harrison Ford and the original movie. What a disappointment. PLEASE skip this one and go right to the original."
3,Glossy and picture perfect,"This is mainly a Harrison Ford vehicle that doesn't live up to the original by Billy Wilder with Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. Which is a shame since it's a remarkably well-made, smooth romantic comedy. Julia Ormond is exceedingly charming, and if her leading man doesn't quite deliver his usual suave charm, the excellent cinematography and classy musical score make up for some of the disappointment.The story of Sabrina never fails to charm, though, regardless of the players. Her awkward dreamer character grows up, and then beguiles and humanizes the awkward, crusty businessman. Pick up the classic version for a night when a master's work can be appreciated. This version is light and cheering for a relaxing evening."
5,J's Opinion,"I loved this movie!!! The original of course is the best, but I must say that Harrison Ford still hasn't lost the touch. I love the actors they used and the paris setting make you want to go visit. You should buy this movie. I watch it every week at least 2X!"
5,A new Classic.,"Unfortunately, I have not seen the classic version of this movie yet. In fact, I didn't even know it was a re-make.It's an early 90's rags to riches, love story. Like Pretty Woman without the hooker part. I feel that Julia Ormond had terrific chemistry with Harrison Ford. It even made me have little flutters when I anticipated a kiss.I love this movie!"
4,"good, clean fun!","This movie suffered disasterous reviews upon release, but it's worth a second look. It is truly a romantic movie, that plays on all your notions of what love is supposed to be. Greg Kinnear as ""David"" is especially charming, and I almost felt like rooting for him, instead of Harrison Ford. The scenes of Paris are great, and you really, really wish, you had a contact that would set you up with and apartment in Paris with a job at Vogue magazine.Alas, that is not in the cards.. but I can still pop in the video and pretend i was there.."
4,Wonderful!,I have never seen the original but I am glad because I got to view this movie for its own merits and not constantly compare it to the original. This was simply a wonderful movie. I laughed and cried and got that tingly all over feeling that good love scenes provide. The chemistry between Ormond and sexy Harrison Ford is so real you can almost touch it. Some of Ford's lines are a little hokey but that is totally forgiveable. I own very few movies but this one I am going to buy for my tiny collection so I can watch it again and again.
4,Good romantic Chick Flik,I really enjoy this story. I have watched it many times. It is a very good remake of a classic.
5,A Romantic Comedy For All Ages Starring...INDIANA JONES???!!! Quite A Pleasant Surprise.,"Sydney Pollack's remake of the movie starring Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn and William Holden is very well done. Aside from some mild language, the movie is family-friendly. The plot is probably familiar to even those who haven't seen the original version directed by Billy Wilder (I sure haven't), but the remake is very entertaining, humorous, engaging and...words simply fail to describe this enjoyable confection of a movie. Indiana Jones himself, Julia Ormond and Greg Kinnear star.Everyone involved in this movie did a wonderful job. And...John Williams, what else can be said? The man is simply another Mozart in composing music for movies (virtually every film for Steven Spielberg, the ""STAR WARS"" movies, ""Superman: The Movie,"" etc); his work is simply brilliant. Everything he touches turns to gold. Enough said. Be prepared to find your heart. Rated PG for mild language."
4,Light entertainment,"This movie isn't the best, I'll be completely up front. Julia Ormond is just completely lacking of charm, and if you've seen the original, it comes across even more plainly. However - it really is a fun film with witty dialogue that I find watching over and over despite its problems.The banter and camaraderie of the house servants, as well as the sharp wit of Linus and Mrs. Larabee, provide a humorous and entertaining aspect that makes this film worth owning for a rainy day."
5,"Sabrina ""A cute romance""","Rarely are remakes better than the originals versions, but in this version of Sabrina they accomplish just that. I like this version of Sabrina better than the original version, because of the wonderful acting and dialogue. This movie reminds me of a fairy tale with a unexpected happy ending. This movie will make you laugh and make you smile during the whole movie. It is one of the few movies Harrison Ford has every played that wasn't an action or drama film. In this movie it shows that Harrison Ford is not only good at acting in drama movies but that he actually has a romantic bone in his body."
5,well done remake of a classic,I loved the original with Bogart and this one was well made and sticking to the original beautifully.
2,SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"FIRST, LET ME SAY THAT I AM A BIG AUDREY HEPBURN FAN AND SO I ALREADY HAD MY RESERVATIONS BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU REMAKE SOMETHING TO BE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL (WHICH WAS ALREADY PERFECT)? BUT I WAS WILLING TO GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE...SECOND,I AM ALL FOR CHANGE/UPDATES, BUT THIS MOVIE , EVEN WITH THE UPDATES, JUST DIDN'T CUT IT...JULIA ORMOND WAS CUTE, BUT SHE WAS SO STIFF AND TIMID, SO UNLIKE THE PASSIONATE SABRINA IN THE ORIGINAL.HARRISON'S PORTRAYAL OF LINUS WAS ""OK"" BUT THERE WAS JUST NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO CHARACTERS.WHEN MY CO-WORKER PRESENTED ME WITH THIS MOVIE(I HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THE REMAKE) I IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD BE ATLEAST GOOD, BUT SADLY I WINCED THROUGH MOST OF THE SCENES. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY GOOD REMAKE THOUGH, TOO BAD IT ISN'T..."
5,Doesn't get better for the cost.,I ordered these after seeing Kevin Bacon wearing Ray Ban Wayfarers just like them in the latest X Men movie. They came quick and I've been wearing them almost every day since. Great product and exceptional price.
3,GOOD FOR HARRISON FORD FANS LIKE ME,I SAW THIS MOVIE FOR THE FRIST TIME LAST NIGHT AND THOUGHT IT WAS ALLRIGHT. I LOVE HARRISON. HE IS GOOD IN THIS MOVIE. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE BELIVESABLE THAN THE ORIGANAL. BECAUSE THE AGE DIFFERANCE BEETWEN SABRINA ND LINUS IS NOT SO BIG. IT IS A LITTTLE SLOW MOVING AT PARTS BETTER EDITING WOULD HAVE HELPED.
3,"Julia Ormond fans won't want to miss ""Sabrina""","Julia Ormond fans won't want to miss ""Sabrina."" Although she fails to outshine Audrey Hepburn's legendary performance in the Billy Wilder filmof the same name, Ormond has plenty of star presence of her own to help make this ""Sabrina"" a treat."
2,Not as nearly as good as the original,"The problem with this movie is that the actors could not decide whether they were trying to be themselves or the old actors. Julia Ormond, especially, kept sort of, but not quite, acting like Audrey Hepburn. It didn't seem to be a case of her not being able to pull off the character; it just seemed like either she or the director could not decide whether they were doing something new or directly remaking the old version. It would have been better if they had completely cut ties with the past.The movie also seemed to move quite slowly, and there was very little chemistry between Julia Ormond or either of her suitors. I love Harrison Ford, but Linus here just came off as a jerk, and Sabrina came off as too stupid to see how mean he was. The crucial love scene between them was rushed, and far too much time was spent showing how scheming he was.If you liked the 1954 version of this movie, I would skip this one. I was disappointed."
2,decent,It came more scratched and the back of the disc was foggy. Not sure if I would recommend many used dvd purchases.
3,Sabrina,I actually enjoyed this version of Sabrina much more than I did the original. Maybe because this one was more real. You understood why Sabrina went to Paris. The reason she went flowed through out the movie and made much better sense than the original. Good chick flick. ;)
3,Sabrina - Harrison Ford,A solidly enjoyable mushy romance. Nice update in that the Sabrina charactor was a much more substantial human being.
1,could not play this movie,"This movie only plays on USA DVD machins I live in England and could not play it, it was out of my reagen Sabrina"
5,Better than the original!,I LOVE this movie! So good! I personally think it is better then the original.I like Linus' and Sabrina's romance so much better! So sweet! I would highly recommend this movie!
3,Best line of the movie:,"""We were up to our elbows in your underwear drawer, it was like touching the shroud of tourin"" Haha ha!"
5,The reason I went to Paris....,"I love, love, love this movie. Julia is beautiful and Harrison does an amazing job, far from his usual role of treasure hunter. If this remake doesn't get you then the music will, it is a romantic shiny movie and I cry every time I watch it. Yes, I am a girlie girl. Then there's Sting, ahhhh, ""In the Moonlight.""I heart this movie."
3,Ok movie,"It is not the movie that I remembered. It is Ok. I find it slow. I am not a fan of romantic comedies, but I am a fan of Harrison Ford. I saw this movie years ago so I just didn't remember it was slow."
4,"Fast shipping, good service","Fast shipping, good service. The only problem is that when I play it on my laptop, there are some noise or interrupts once in a while. But I think this has something to do with my laptop. Overall, good service.Thanks."
3,Sabrina,I bought this movie for my daughter. She enjoys it and watches it often. I would recommend this movie. Its a good clean movie for the family to enjoy.
3,"No, NOT more than just a romantic comedy....","Please; let's not give this more credit than it's due. It IS just a romantic comedy, and a semi-lame one at that. The stars just have no real chemistry. Plus, you don't look for depth in films like this, you look for entertainment. Easy to sum up: Watchable, but pales next to the original. And as to suggestions that Jennifer Lopex or Halle Berry should've played Sabrina... once a skunk's sprayed, why keep calling attention to the stink?"
2,Sabrina,I ordered this dvd on March 1st; today is April 1st and i still have not received the dvd or any correspondence witht he seller; yet I have paid for the item. I am greatly disappointed in the transaction. I am still hoping for the best and hoping I will receive the item.
4,An Enjoyable Remake,"I am not a fan of classic films being remade but this one was not bad. Greg Kinnear was particularly good. Some of the innocence of the original was lost in trying to ""update"" the story, which is too bad. But the story stayed true to the original which is something that usually cannot be said about remakes. But, don't miss the original because there will never be another Audrey Hepburn and she was brilliant as Sabrina."
3,"Works ""ok"" and makes a heckuva racket","Like many shoppers here, I'm always on the lookout for a better mousetrap. When I first got this whisk I was very excited about it and thought it worked great. After a few months though, I've realized that it is really not any better than my regular whisk: it doesn't do as good a job of aerating things; it is just as difficult to clean; and it makes a godawful racket, even against plastic bowls. I might try ordering the nonstick version to see if it is any quieter."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I bought this based on rave reviews online, but I've been disappointed. I don't like the clack-clack-clack sound this whisk makes when it hits the sides of the glass bowl, and I find that the independent movement of all the pieces gets in the way of smooth mixing. I'm now shopping for a new whisk. I read in America's Test Kitchen's cookbook that their favorite was a narrow balloon-shaped whisk, so I'm on the hunt."
1,Not for our library!!,"I was surprised by the language in this book: ""shut up"", ""clumsy idiot"", and ""big fat clod-hopper"". These harsh words have no place in children's literature!!The story could have been easily told without language such as this."
1,Why Isn't the Rating of ZERO Included,"The thirteen-year-old reviewer (May 6, 2000) who gave a five-star salute to this piece of garbage, is trying to resolve the conflict in her young mind as to how to be at peace for admiring an album whose hero is a teenage gangbanger who murders two kids. It's not for little kids, she says. Paul Simon's tale will inspire the young and many others to believe that murder is cool."
5,A Haunting Musical Tale Filled with Life and Soul,"I was haunted by the music of this CD. I saw the play and while I did not feel it was the disaster most felt, I still feel Simon missed the boat on revealing the whys and wherefore's of Salvador Agron's character. Yet, after repeated listenings to this work, I continue to find beautiful musical interpretations of the time and place of that sad story. Futhermore, musically, it's as diverse and valuable as anything Simon has ever done. As to the profanity, yes, it's significant but never outside the character of the song's purpose. This work is well worth including in your collection. It grows in value."
4,The subject matter is intriguing-what I'd expect from Simon.,"I saw the show and bought the CD during intermission. I was very disappointed that the CD didn't represent the songs as they were performed in the play because in the cast there were some of the most outstanding voices I'd ever heard backed by a lively, soulful Latino band. There were samplings of cast-member voices on the CD but it fell very short of my expectations of the entire Broadway show soundtrack. Even though I warmed to the CD in time, I still missed the infectious spirit of the Latino rhythm and the beautiful voices of the cast."
2,Wait For the Original Cast Recording to be Released,"This CD is ok, but it does not capture the true emotional charge of the Broadway production, nor its ensemble intensity. And performing some of the songs is a real stretch for Simon, whose vocal range does not match his creative talents."
1,C'mon...,"I can't believe this cd has the same rating as his greatest hit collection! This cd is a disaster, it is boring, but mostly it is not what people want when they purchase a Simon cd. Steer clear of this stinker, this rates up there with Van Halen 3. (Or is it DOWN there?)"
3,F word used repeatedly,"I liked the album except Paul used the F- word in one of the early tracks, I skipped it and he did it again within the next track or two. Haven't listened to it since. Beware. Wish there was a clean version available somewhere."
1,misses by a mile,"There's nothing really to say that hasn't already been said except: If you don't understand why this record has been reviewed unfavorably, you might consider actually reading its unfavorable reviews."
2,Nice wallpaper music,"I really love P.S and had high hopes when I bought this album, without pre-hearing it. But I'm not very enthousiastic. At first, I was very disappointed, I only heard him in about 2 or 3 songs and felt cheated. I still do. But in coping with this misbuy, I found that the music is very good for a relaxed evening, or during dinner, it has nice tunes, a stong latin touch and a reminiscence of Westside story. So not a total waste after all."
1,Worst cd in 20 years,"I join others who really admire Paul Simon. The guy is right up there with Gershwin, Lennon/McCartney, Jimmy Webb - incredible stable of certifiable neo-classics. How did he come up with THIS? I actually couldn't take it. I kept thinking this was a latest mockumentary by the Spinal Tap folks. I don't want to say much more. I saw Simon & Garfunkel in the late 60's at a smaller venue. It was like magic! Their catalog is stunning. His earlier solo albums are also great although Hearts and Bones should have had Garfunkel singing ... It would have equalled their best work. This album, Capeman, is absurd in every respect. That's what happens I suppose when you lay low in the Brill Building too long. I see that Simon's work has gotten better but I'm still shaken after this bomb. The S&G albums just sound better and better."
2,"Skip this one, get another","I like Paul Simon and have been getting all his stuff from the 80s and 90s, but this one is, without a doubt, the biggest disappointment...it is in several areas..I only like one song, the last one ""trailways bus,"" but I am very troubled by the theme of this record, which is the story of a young puertorican who killed two people in 1950s. Unless you really want to analyze it, he almost seems to glorify the killings as most of the songs are from his point of view, or the point of view of his family. I don't know - I like the latin music theme (that's why I got it), but the story and lyrics intermixed don't work. This could have been so much better, if Paul Simon avoided this particular theme and concentrated more one creating better songs...Sometimes not everything thing, even if it is from someone as talented as Simon, and this album is evidence of my theory."
2,"The Capeman Is Far From Super, Man","I give simon two stars instead of one because i respect the undertaking. artists should be allowed by their fans to explore new territory and try new things. a musical would seem natural for simon, who has always excelled at narratives and finding the point of dramatic tension in his lyrics. but i have to say, this cd is pretty horrible. a decent song here and there maybe, but that's generous. the songs are disjointed and insipid. i'm not sure how people could give this cd four or five stars, the same ratings that they would give graceland or his eponymous first album. it's not that good. it's not even close. if you can't resist the urge to buy this album, do yourself the favor of buying it used. the last time i checked, it was selling used for ten cents. that should tell you something in itself."
3,Favorable review,"Simon has taken a few of the songs he wrote for ""Capeman"" and recorded a nicely put together album of songs he felt he could perform. A few of the cast members join him to punctuate the songs and characters. This is NOT a typical ""Paul Simon"" album but rather a sampling of good songs written for his broadway play. There is enough of a story here by itself to give a feeling of what the musical is/was about and its general tone. The songs develop from the music of that time period - late 1950's DooWop being sung on New York's street corners to the salsa/latin music of the Puerto Rican slum districts. The music evokes fresh images of the gangs of the NYC and the violent crime that took the life of two teenagers in the wrong place at the wrong time. Great musical arrangements from the simplicity of a single voice with acoustic guitar to incredible orchestration with complex arrangements."
2,Culturally Shallow Music,"I'm a big Paul Simon fan, but I was extremely disappointed in this album. Simon presents a very stereotyped view of Latino people in this music, and the music itself is relatively predictable and stale. He seems to be bouncing from culture to culture, looking for something new but, in this instance, skimming the surface and failing to find it. Too superficial. Much too disappointing for Simon devotees. I'm selling mine to the used CD store."
5,Very underrated but very good,"Paul Simon has explored many music genres. In this recording he has nailed the essence of 50's beat and culture. Oh, the harmonies of the two female singers brought in for the recording, along with Satin Summer Nights! I can't stop playing this record. Mr. Simon took much heat for this concept album but it's one of his best."
5,The Man Just Gets Better,"I am completely addicted to this album! Ever since I bought it, I haven't been able to turn it off. At first, the few curse words in it caught me off guard, but it is about a man who killed two people and was in a gang called the vampires. There's bound to be some swearing somewhere. But I absolutely love this album. If you're hesitating at all to buy it, don't. Just BUY THIS ALBUM!"
1,Pathetic,"I must say, there is no bigger Paul Simon fan than me... But this album, what a joke! What was Paul thinking to make him release this? Give it a miss."
4,So what if it's about a grown up subject?,"This CD has a lot going for it. Musically, it's diverse; interesting. I like the music very much, but that's not what makes this CD special - there are plenty of other CD's around with nice music.What's so special is the lyrics. They're expressive, poet and abrasive. They are real. A few people on this site have doled out 1 star reviews, claiming to be upset about the sordid language. I suggest that these people grow up. Last time I noticed, thats how REAL people often speak in certain situations. These songs are very real, they feel very genuine. If you're after music that is about nothing more than selling itself for mass consumption, you'd best look elsewhere.This CD is affecting and thought provoking - and I think that is a GOOD thing."
1,Offensive glorification of gang violence,"I am deeply offended by the violence depicted in this music. It is not at all what I expect from Paul Simon.I am puzzled by the critics' praise for this CD, and their use of adjectives like ""sweetness"" when describing it. I find nothing ""sweet"" about murder, profanity, and gang violence, especially when it is depicted sentimentally as it is here.What was Paul Simon thinking of when he wrote this? What were the critics listening to when they wrote their reviews? This is truly the worst CD I've bought."
3,"Good, not great","I am at once pleased and disappointed with this album. I was moved by ""Adios Hermanos"" (though I do think it's misleading as far as history goes) and ""Sunday Afternoon"" and loved the soulful ""Satin Summer Nights"" but didn't care much for about 5 of the songs, which is unusual because I normally love all of them. I'd recommend this album to any die-hard fan like myself, but for a newcomer I'd definitely tell them to try out his older stuff first. Although I've liked his ventures into the music of other cultures, I wonder if it's the only way he can put out an album now. I'd love to hear him do something completely new, akin to the rejuvenation of Graceland. I'm also concerned about the problems other reviewers have had about the profanity. If this album failed to measure up, it was not because of that."
3,It grows on you.,"Although I was a bit dissapointed with this album at first because it wasn't traditional Paul Simon, I persisted and now actually like it. The profanity is still abrasive but the story and music are wonderful. I wish I could have seen the show."
5,One of my favorite albums in the first stage of Metheny!,"I love this album. It owns that genius touch that can be appreciated from the first bars of the First song to the last one. Metheny sounds look so fresh, contagious, gifted of this engaging emotiveness and joy of living that will seduce you instantaneously. Watercolors and Lakes are the most delirious tracks of the CD, but in general the quality level of the album is so high that it will be a hard task for you to decide about your special favoritism around a special theme.A fantastic album, permeated by a colossal musical inventive and delirious flair."
5,beautiful music,"Sugarloaf Suite is a beautiful record and one that I play over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over, et cetera. If Charlie doesn't get you moving with his ""Meninas Brincando (Little Girls At Play)"" then I feel sorry for you."
5,THE BEST WITNESSING CD EVER,"I am passionate about music...and with over 100 CDs I own, I have NOT found a more ""perfect"" CD to witness to someone than ""BY FAITH"" from Kim Boyce.I buy these CDs by bundles and give them as gifts for witnessing to others. Usually with music CDs,there's one or a couple of songs on an album that doesn't grasp your attention...However ALL songs from beginning to end have such BEAUTIFUL lyrics and music...Each song ministers straight to the soul!!!On a scale from 1 - 1,000...this CD is 1,000!! It's a MUST for people who would consider witnessing to others through music...A MUST for hurting people...A MUST for ALL Christians and NON-Christians alike!"

4,Don't leave for Rome without it,"I honeymooned in Italy and visited Rome, Florence, Milan and Venice. For the latter three, I did not have the aide of a Spiral Guide. Big mistake. This AAA guide contains all of the go-to places you need to know about when travelling in a city abroad. Its glossy lamination makes it care-free to take on the go with you, and pull out in the rain when in a jam (that came in handy). And the biggest plus was the multiple maps that gave an overview of each section of the city.I recommend this or any of its subsequent editions. While not perfect (some restaurants had changed owners), it was much more comprehensive than other titles out there."
5,great,"my purchase was great. thank you!I enjoy playing dance machine with these cool pads and i hope that the usb cable won't break like my last one did. otherwise, its sleek and nice and adds to our dance machine in a big way."
2,"Nice Idea, Poor Quality.","I bought this dance pad because I wanted one that I could use with my computer for Stepmania, and also at friend's houses with their XBoxes and PS2s. Well, as it turns out, only the PS2 connector on mine works. The USB works for about 5 seconds, and then stops working. When you use the XBox connector, only the up and right arrows work.I ended up having to buy a PS2 adapter! How silly is that? Get a different dance pad."
3,pad is ok for a basic plastic pad - no foam,"This pad works ok, but you can get much better pads with 1"" foam insert for not much more money ($20 -> $30). I recommend you do so. They mention something in the description about foam, but do not be mistaken, this is not a foam pad. It's non slip, but not padded. Also the little disks which are supposed to help your feet 'feel' the switches, well I couldn't make any sense out of them."
1,Poor quality,"I bought 2 of them to play with my girl friend.After a week and not more than 5 sessions, one of the pad has already problems... Arrows wouldn't detect when I press them and would detect when I don't press them. Very annoying...For that price I'm not really want to return it to have a new one."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"simply, It didn't work, it's hard to configer on the coputer, doesn't respond on the steps,I don't recomend it for anybody, it's just a waste of money."
1,I was tricked...,"I wouldn't recommend this pad. The right sensor must be too big because it drags down to the ""X"" (Square) button, and I get random misses with the right. Even after modding (taping to dense foam), I still can't play with this pad, even with the ""Controller Setting"" set to off. (The Triangle & Square buttons still go off, unfortunately). I need a pad with NO square or Triangle button, just ""X"" and ""O"". I guess that's the price you pay for getting a ""universal"" pad. Should stick to ""PSX"" pads only. FYI, my old soft pad, (a cheap soft pad from Wal-Mart) after modding, lasted me over three years, while this pad lasted for two days!!!It's back to the arcade now. (With an accurate, metal pad)"
2,DDR is fun but this dance pad is pretty bad.,The reviews for the dance pad said that it is not good for experts but might be OK for beginners. Not true. It is bad for beginners as well. The pad slips too much. Within a month of buying it the sensors are already weak and have moved from their original position. I don't recommend buying this dance pad.
3,Slips a lot,"It's definitely NOT non-slip. Slips a lot, actually. Use something like duct tape or something to hold it in place. I guess it wouldn't slip so much if your center of gravity stays center. It doesn't slip too much when playing light-mode songs. It'll starts slipping when I played more intensive standard-mode songs.The sensitivity of the buttons are okay. I don't have to stomp too hard, but it's definitely not comparable to the ones at the arcade."
4,Good Deal,"I bought this dance pad to connect to my computer through USB. After configuring the mappings in StepMania, it works quite well.This pad is quite sturdy, and is capable of detecting my moves. I usually play on the Light/Medium levels of StepMania, but I find it easier to hit the notes on Light. On the arcade machines (the ones with the heavy metal pads), I was able to easily hit the ones on the Medium levels.The only grouse that I have is that it keeps slipping a bit on the carpeted floor of my apartment. Because of that, I'd give it only 4.5 stars out of 5. But otherwise, it's a great deal."
4,MMPI-2 at a glance,"While I am not a big fan of the MMPI2, if you must use it and write reports on it, this book will help you out immensely.However, if you are just beginning to do assessments, I recommend mastering the Personality Assesssment Inventory (PAI) instead, because it was written in response to MMPI criticisms and is more contemporary. And if for no other reason than the fact that you don't need millions of stencils to handscore it!!"
3,"Drives us crazy, but she likes it.","I am not a fan of Map's voice and his ""I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the map I'm the maaaaaaaap!""song, but my 2 year old loves to dance to the music and has learned many Spanish words from Dora."
3,Brief Descriptions of Americana,"This book would be an appropriate gift for foreigners who have just recently been granted American citizenship; it includes many people, places and things which are important to American cultural history, and the reading level is not difficult. If you were born and raised in the USA, this book will be a pleasant trip down memory lane. Most of the ""places and things"" entries were familiar to me, but there were countless ""people"" entries that I had never even heard of. Unfortunately, the photographic illustrations are of poor quality."
5,I definitely recommend this CD!!,"This is one of my favorite cd's. I love the whole thing. I would say At Night I Pray is one of my favorites. I like the ladies voices and how well they harmonize. If you are more into the artist singing, I would suggest this cd :)."
3,Wild Orchid,"After seeing Fergie perform on a talk show recently I gave this album a listen to hear how she sounded prior to joining the BEPs. No doubt, as a group they sound terrific especially on the songs where the vocal production is more subtle and features their stellar harmonies like on: SUPERNATURAL, FOLLOW ME, LOVE WILL WAIT, LIFE & I WON'T PLAY THE FOOL. I also love the funky production on MY TAMBOURINE.The tracks that I dislike the most are those where the lead vocals sound too forced like on AT NIGHT I PRAY & THE RIVER. Overall this is a good debut disc that features songs with deep lyrics but which aren't too catchy or memorable enough to have stood out."
2,A rather dry account of the Archduke Charles of Austria,"When first published, this book was touted as the only English text dealing specifically with the Austrian Army and Archduke Charles. There are now several other books on essentially the same topic. I found this book to be rather too academic for the lay reader (me), dwelling as it does in considerable details on Army organisation and reorganisation and other statistical details. There is also a heavy reliance on Austrian sources for the text. The author is aware of this and tries to correct the imbalance in treatment by selective use of material from other sources. However, one is still left with the feeling that this tome is not the definitive account of the Archduke Charles."
3,Not his best work,"""Home Invasion"" was recorded during Ice-T's difficulties with the Body Count CD and Warner Bros., and the stress shows. Still good, but probably his least-inspired work. ""Power"" and ""O.G."" remain the best examples of Ice-T's powerful work, and ""Greatest Hits - The Evidence"" is a great retrospective. Get those first, ""Home Invasion"" only to complete a collection."
2,very average and the beginning of the end,this was the beginning of the end of a good artist that went down hill.Race War is a good cut but aside from that this album is a one trick pony.in one album he was far removed from the Peak of Original Gangsta OG album.the whole Warner Brothers flap with Cop Killer but an end to his interesting Career.he was in a war with Warners sounds like Prince a few years later HMM? the battle of COntrol.different Problems between the two artists with the label but the same results in that both acts never recovered from a music point of view as of yet.
5,hard to find old school,"Had to buy this album after my cassette tape was stolen over 20 years ago :-|I just had to get the 'message to the soldiers' track.great service Amazon, well done...even greater price!I must say that my musical preferences and maturity have evolved somewhat since then! I most certainly would not let my two young boys listen to this album!! (6&4)"
3,A Letdown at the hoedown,"While riding high atop the crest of publicity he garnered from his ""Copkiller"" publicity and Time-Warner pullout, expectations at the time of this release were pretty damn high. Probably too high, because ""O.G."" was a critical high point to slam all others to the ground.I would have been satisfied if this album continued in the same vein, but unfortunately it's wayyy too patchy. Too many throwaway tracks like ""99 Problems"", ""Funky Gribsta"" and ""Pimp Behind The Wheel"" to take it very seriously, although there are more than a few tunes worth owning. You just gotta dig 'em out.""Gotta Lotta Love"" is hated by many, but is one of the only tracks on this album with any substance, so it's essential. Ditto ""I Ain't New To This"", ""That's How I'm Living"", and ""Message To The Soldier""."
4,Race War,"This album is brilliant, but not as good as ""Original Gangster"". The song ""Race War"" as a lot of truths in the lyrics. Keep it up Ice."
2,Ice-T - Home Invasion,"This was a pretty bad album from Ice-T but I've heard worse from him. I think that all that ""Cop Killer"" hoopla clouded his vision. There are a lot of lousy tracks on here like ""99 Problems"", which Jay-Z took from and made his own version of it for 2003's The Black Album."
2,Not for biologists,"I'm an upper level biology major at a 4-year university, and I think every term that I looked up was not in this book. Maybe it would be fine for people who know absolutely nothing about biology, but if you're looking for a book to give you something a little extra other than your biology text book, this is not it."
2,Not so good,I am a biology major and my professor suggested purchasing this dictionary. I did and have used it very few times. The times that I did used it I left with more questions than answers. If you do not speak the language of biology fluently this dictionary will be very confusing.
2,No breathing instruction!!,"I wanted to love this DVD, I think many of the exercise positions are good, but there is nowhere on this $29.95 2 disc set which gives any sort of breathing instructions.I emailed the oxycise website, but no one ever got back to me."
1,very basic intro trading book,"This book is not at all specific to the e-minis. There are perhaps only 3 pages in the whole book specific to them, the rest is just a very basic intro to trading, describing different chart types (bar,candles,etc) and very basic setups. Additionally, everything in the book is redundant with an entire page for the short setup, then an entire exactly opposite page for the long setup, with minimal information on each page. So although the book is like 200 pages, I literally read the entire thing in 2 hours. If it was free, it may have been worth the 2 hours."
5,Another excellent product from SKB,"There is no one else anywhere that makes cases like SKB.This trombone case is as sturdy and as well constructed as the other cases I have purchasedfrom SKB over the years.Some comment must also be made to the 'above and beyond' customer service from the SKB staffwho in my opinion are determined, by every means possible, to ensure 100 percent customer satisfaction.So in summing up, great products backed by tremendous customer service, what more would anyone want.Brian LevyWestern Australia."
5,Twin genius',I thoroughly enjoy each othese musicians on their own. Combining them is shear mastery. What a great collection of works by two masters.
4,Fun High Quality 60's Spy Flick,"Deadlier Than The Male is a really fun tongue-in-cheek 1960's spy film. It is a bit more comedic than Bond films, but less so than the Flint films. Although towards the end it does lean more towards the Flint films. The production values were surprisingly high, this was NOT a low budget quickie. It is filled with exotic locations and fun characters. The Hen's Tooth Video DVD is of a very high play quality. If you like this genre of films, then this is a must have."
4,Fun with Bulldog Drummond,I just finished watching the movie Deadlier than the Male. I really enjoyed it. It is a good spin on the action movies of the sixties. The story moves briskly and the 2 female leads are attractive and deliver fine performances.This is not Bond or a made up agent it is Bulldog Drummond a well documented and oftened filmed character in British literature. the movie grabs you right from the opening scene where 2 lovely ladies come out of the water with spear guns. You know they are there for trouble. I recommend it to anyone in on Bond films or the sixties action films. You will find it quite enjoyable.
3,Fun but not Funny,"Though I thought this film was pleasant enough, it ultimately was neither campy enough or action packed enough to ever get me too excited.The plot feels second rate, the hero as played by Richard Johnson is about as bland as you get and any attempts at campy humor were too subtle to ever make me laugh.All but serious student of 60's pop culture are probably going to feel a little disappointed after purchasing this film. It isn't nearly as good or fun as the cover illustration makes it seem."
3,Carbon copy Bond,"The James Bond craze of the 1960s sent studios scurrying to secure the rights to other literary secret agents and detectives, and alter them to fit the successful 007 formula. Novelist H. C. McNeile's creation ""Bulldog Drummond"" was showcased in numerous mystery films in the '20s and '30s; for this 1966 spy movie, however, the urbane sleuth was reconfigured into a carbon copy of Bond.Like the Bond films, there's a strong (and welcome) emphasis on female villainy, represented here in the shape-make that shapes-of blonde Elke Sommer and brunette Sylvia Koscina. They're stunning and, as such, the primary reasons to sit through this run-of-the-mill rehash of the kind of spy movie clichés that Mike Myers has made a cottage industry out of satirizing."
1,Peerless power failure,"The Peerless may be a good drive if you can get it to work. Software install went fine and my computer recognized the drive right away, except the unit had no power. Iomega technical support line hours are incorrectly published and I was unable to get help. I will think twice about every getting another Iomega product again."
3,Is this being discontinued?,"I bought this Peerless backup system and some extra tapes in Dec 2001 from Amazon. I have been satisfied with the product. We use it to back up 5 computers every week. Recently the tape would not eject from the drive. AFter email discussion with Iomega reps, I determined it was not a software problem. I decided to buy an additional unit to use since removing the tape with a paperclip each time is a hassle. It appears this system is being discontinued. You can no longer buy tapes from the maker (Iomega)and the bundles are scarce. I think soon you will not be able to buy them anywhere. I like the system and have bought 2 bundles as backup. If you like this item, better stock up now."
1,Another Unnecessary Proprietary Format,"There's a review of the Peerless system in the current Mac Home Journal (review's not posted yet, though). Gives it a 2 out of 5 rating. Basically, it says that the drive is far too costly to be economical, unless you're using a lot of cartridges for backups/etc. Otherwise, you'll be better served by self-contained external Firewire HDs than another proprietary format.That, Iomega's disasterous customer service record, their continued problems with large-format external drives, and their recent financial woes, should all but obliterate the drive from anyone's wish list.Sure it might work great. So did the SyJet from Syquest. And so did Betamax. Bottom line, keep it standardized -- CDs, DVDs, and hard drives are your best bet for backup and archiving, especially for off-site (I'm talking external firewire HDs, obviously)."
2,"Makes no sense, dollarwise","First, you can get a standard 40 Gig IDE hard drive for less money than Iomega's 20 Gig disk. And you can get a combination USB/firewire (911 chipset) drive enclosure (converts astandard IDE drive into a USB/firewire drive) for less thanthe Iomega peerless base unit. Why pay triple or quadruplethe cost (dollars per Gigabyte) for something less standard and less compatible?"
2,A new base station every time? NO THANKS...,"So, I just bought this (...), and I managed to get the entire bundle (base station, 20g drive) for the price of the drive alone. (...) Nonetheless, I was under the impression that I could slide the drive out of the base station, and with usb cable, plug into any other computer. WRONG. You need a new base station for every computer you intend to access the drive from. (...). I would advise that it is useful ONLY if you're going to operate it from a single computer. Otherwise, there are other products out there for less, that are far more useful."
4,Great and captivating read.,"I loved this book, and in defense of the person that said Kain is rude and stuck up....you have to remember that you may have caught her at a bad time. We can only wonder what it would be like to have fans constantly in your face. I thought the book was wonderful, and very insightful. Karen Kain remains a charismatic performer in my eyes."
5,the grace of a feather,"I absolutely loved this book. I recieved it as a gift, and being a dancer i sat down and read it right away. It was amazing!! Karen Kain is such an exciting dancer, with new bounds at every jump. It made me remember that i can achieve my dreams!!! *S*"
4,Good stretching DVD.,"This is very plain and bare bones but the stretching is great. I feel relaxed afterward, almost like I can breathe better."
2,"anti-adult, anti-Christian","As someone who used to live in Japan, I was eager to read this. I hoped to find a book that my daughter could read to give her a glimpse of the life I used to know. However, I would not recommend this to any teen. The book is disturbing, because with the exception of a young, divorced, athiest, all of the adults are portrayed as either naive, frumpy, foolish, or hypocritical. The author is especially harsh on the Christian characters, both adults and teens, but also portrays others with religious beliefs negatively. Only the atheist comes out shining. The overall mood of the book is very negative. I was glad when I finished it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because it does have some literary merit, unlike a lot of the stuff teens read these days."
4,The best YA book,My friend was the first to read this book and I started after her after grabbing it to do a report. Most the time I barley get litte over half way through then I'm done. Not with this book. I stayed up for hours becuase it's one of those books you can't put down. The author is so good you acually feel like you know Megumi and what she is going through.
4,"small 1""x3"" fit my kid's bike","Buyers beware, these pegs are very small the dimension is 1"" diameter and 3"" length. But I am happy with them because I install them on my kid bike. They fit exactly, just thread on. There come with black and silver color selection. The price is nice. I think the threads are universal. They fit on my other bikes also."
2,Size was deceptive!,"The Size was deceptive, it was not the standard BMX bike peg size. it is very small almost non functional for the purpose that pegs are to be used by children."
3,14K gold popcorn chain,"I ordered an 18"" chain and it measures 17"". I do feel that is deceptive.Otherwise the chain is lovely. Just order a longer length. Also, does not weigh nearly what they claim!"
4,Got Kids??,"If your elders ever sang and played for you when you were small, you might appreciate this. Top notch slack key playing by George Kahumoku, Jr, with nice singing and nice ululele by his adult son, Keoki. As an adult, the sound effects got in the way for me, but this might be fun for children - babies crying and dogs howling, sounds of residential plumbing, waves on the shore, animal noises... Songs are also well chosen to be light and fun for the young crowd. Arrangements vary from smooth and straightforward slack key to playful and silly songs. U'lili E is terrific and unlike any other version I've heard. This is a real find if you have little ones, but if you're just looking for Hawaiian slack key, start with some of the other great stuff out there. Around 45 minutes of music."
4,"A strong effort, and well worth your time.","Belly is one of my favorite bands, so naturally, this album intruiged me. What puzzles me about most of the reviews I've read is their failure to mention the dual coup d'etat of the album; manna and swoon. These form a kinetic structure akin to what we saw on Star with Untogether and Star, and what we saw on King with Red & Silverfish. With the added spiking of the thoughtful Mysteries of the unexplained, you have a strong, enjoyable album. It's not an album to have on as you wash the dishes or vacuum the floors, but rather one to pay attention to, to take the time to appreciate its subtle nuance and style. Curiously, I found Lantern to be one of the weaker moments on the track, with the exception of the smooth, slow break part in the middle. If you're a Belly fan, you'll probably enjoy this album; just don't expect ""Stay"" like ephiphanies."
2,"What happened to the ""magic""?","Yo, I am just about the biggest advocate of Belly....I STILL tell everyone I meet that if they don't have ""Star"" or ""King"" that they missed out. Yet, after several listens, the only song on this CD that I liked was ""Lantern."" Consequently, it went back to the used CD store pretty darn quick. Better luck next time Tanya, you luscious thing, you!"
2,"lovesongs for the underdog, or for underdogs.....","i think the cd's are too similar to sell one of them for sooo much more than the other. that's my opinion. tanya is my fav artist, and i think she can and will come out with an album ten times better than lovesongs for underdogs. i am waiting until fall to hear it. yay!!"
3,"well, i guess its good","im a huge belly fan, but i found this solo album had some large holes in it. when tanya's voice is usually mysterious and child like, she just sounds annoying at times on this one. i had to turn it off a few times because on tracks like clipped her voice had a horrible piercing quality. but tanya is still breath taking and she almost makes up for it with landspeed song and lantern and a few others. all in all, buy star and listen to that, only buy this one if you loved both belly cds and you are a very loyal fan."
2,relatively disappointing,"Basicly, this album is a huge disappointment compared to her Throwing Muses work and first Belly album, and, of course The Breeders, Safari. If you want good Tanya Donelly, listen to that stuff. I will play this CD occasionally, but its not up to par."
4,I SAW THE CLIMAX COMING,"On the hole, it was a really good book. The only problem I had with it was that I saw it coming when Tony confesses to Heaven that he is her father. The hints were really good, but I wasn't as shocked or suprised and I hate when that happens in a book. Other than that, I though it was well done. I especially liked the character of Troy. He is someone that everyone can relate to. Everyone has know someone in there lives that is self destructive. It also just breaks your heart to watch them slowly butsurely kill themselves. I am looking forward to the next book. They just keep getting better and better."
2,disappointing,after reading the wonderful Heaven I moved on to Dark Angel thinking it would be just as good. I was wrong. The romance between her and Troy just didn't have me convinced. I'll give this series one more chance.
5,A Romeo and Juliet Romance!,"""Dark Angel"" is my favorite book ever written. From the beginning I was entranced by Heaven and Troy's tragic tale. This book made me cry over and over. If you want to read of a heart wrenching romance, this is the book."
5,Dark Angel is a spellbounding story.,"This is my favorite story out all of the works of the late V.C. Andrews. I have reread this book about ten or more times. Heaven is such a strong-willed character. She puts up with a family that acts like they don't want her. Plus, she deals with Logan's indifference, nutty Fanny, Tony's strict rules, the snotty girls from Winterhaven, and the loss of Tom. It warms my heart how she won Troy's heart. If you have the chance to read this book read it."
5,The Best in the Casteel Series,I have read every one of V.C. Andrews tragic novels and consider this book one of the best. It was so wonderful to read about Heaven finding happiness with Troy(even it was short-lived).Just as sad and beautiful as the rest of Ms. Andrews stories.
3,Unsolved mysteries,"Why,oh, why didn't Heaven ever confront Luke with the truth? I would have loved to hear his reasonings on why he never told Heaven that he wasn't her father. If Heaven had any doubts about Tony's allegations, why didn't she just ask Luke?"
3,Not what I expected,"This book did not seem to be the excellent survival book other reviewers suggested. It may be better suited for campers than survivors. The book says things like some ants store honey in their bodies, but it doesn't say which ants. It also says that honey is very nutritious but doesn't tell you how to get honey, but the book does suggest making a table if you have six or more people in a camp. There was even a suggestion that one can make something looking like a bench. If I am ever lost in the woods I doubt I will make a bench! There is also information like the speed at which bees fly or what octopus tastes like... what these things have to do with your survival in the woods, I am unsure of."
3,Victoria Shaw - In Full View (1995),over-all 3 star... just good pop/country from the 90'sIf you like Victoria you'll like Trisha Yearwood and vice versa...Good as Gone -- a good 80s retro-pop-country
1,Not a five-pack,"This item is incorrectly described. I ordered two of these; they arrived as two loose fuses, not in a card pack."
5,The Best 13 String Quartets of Shostakovich You Will Ever Own,"The real shame about this set is of course that it is incomplete. I cry crocodile tears for the 14th as I am not as attached to it as the deeply profound 15th. Oh well, I guess somehow you'll have to get these on your own. I just looked to see if I could find something quick to link and hook you up to a recommendation from Amazon. I guess not.Anyway this is the best set of 13 String Quartets of Shostakovich that you'll ever have. I am not a string player so I can't get into bowing or anything of that nature. I just plain love Shostakovich and find these to be the most expressive string quartets and played very skillfully. I leave at that and try not to be some phoney trying to sell you something.Good Luck on Your Decision."
3,BDK showing his attitude,Kane comes out here a bit harder than earlier issues and that is ok because he can carry it and folks believe in the message...keep going
3,"Defprince review on ""Looks like a job for""","One of the most dopest Mc's alive, The Big Daddy Kane is still at it with hard rhythms, humour and dope lyrics. In my opinion the album was O.k not as good as ""It's a big daddy thing"" but nevertheless what you would expect from the man himself."
3,I like the first 3 kane did,"this is okay kane was trying to fit in the whole gangster rap thing which took over by 93 and like other rappers he looked foolish in the end the same mistake hammer, mc lyte, and others made still if you feel big daddy kane and love old school rap cop it."
1,Music for stopping,"The BPM are not consistent on ""High Performance"" going from 132 to 139 and back down to 132. The songs stop before the song is complete and there is no ""beat"" when flowing from one song to another...a waste of money"
5,Fills in the gaps left by most qigong teachers,"I'm always surprised at the number of qigong students who have never heard of the principles of ""regulating"" (tiao in Chinese). I'm also surprised at the number of qigong teachers who never even mention the topic! It is a fundamental concept of the art.This book fills in that gap. It is a detailed and well-researched textbook of Qigong theory that I recommend to serious students and teachers of qigong, taijiquan (tai chi chuan), and internal martial arts. I use this book constantly in my teaching of qigong and taiji and in my writing on those subjects.Yes, the book is more suitable for the experienced student, and may be tough going for a beginner. If you are already studying or teaching qigong, however, I highly recommend taking the time to study this book."
5,Good book on Qigong theory,One of the best books on Qigong theory I've found and I've read many. While I would not call it a beginner book it is clear & to the point.
4,The search,"This is a great book as an encyclopedia dealing in the development and history of Chinese Chi Kung, at a practical level I prefer the tapes of Al."
1,A gimmick,"I don't recommend this book at all. it is not at all helpful to the average Western reader to begin to properly understand Qigong. Every time it begins to get interesting, the author refers to to another publication of his that deals (according to him , because I didn't fall for it) with the subject. I dropped it two thirds of the way, when I realized I was wasting my time."
5,No-nonsense approach to Qigong,"This book was my introduction to Qigong. Devoid of mysticism, objective and informative, Jwing Ming Yang guides you through the maze of Qigong. For practical Qigong applications this book is irreplaceable. Nevertheless, one must also read ""Muscle Tendon Changing and Marrow Brain Washing Chi Kung"" (highly recommended) and ""Chi Kung: Health and Martial Arts"" (great for Qigong practice) by the same author before starting Qigong practice. The book shows almost no actual Qigong exercises, yet the other books mentioned are not complete without it."
2,Drummer Boy ?,"for being titled Drummer Boy's Christmas, this CD certainly didn't have a very good version of The Little Drummer Boy."
3,Cheap cable housing for bikes,"This isn't high-end performance housing. It's unlined and a bit hard to cut. Even with my Pedro's cutter it wants to smoosh. I end up needing to open it back up with an awl and cleaning the end up with a Dremel-tool cutter attachment.It is unlined cable so be aware that it is not going to be as smooth as high-end housing and will cause more brake cable drag and degrade braking power a little bit. Also, it tends to flex a bit as I think the inner dimension is a bit on the large side so the cable will tend to wiggle around inside and make the cable walk. Long runs of this housing will see a lot of flex and you will lose more of your brake lever travel just compressing it than high-end cable.For fixing up cheap bikes to flip or donate this stuff is perfectly cromulent and the low cost will embiggen your pocketbook when you are using lots of housing on a regular basis. This is a really good deal and 50-feet of housing will do a lot of bikes."
2,Poor Production Quality overshadows decent workout,"The Production quality of this dvd is that of a home movie. Sound is patchy. The camera operator tried to go for some of those artsy shots, when it would have been better just to sit the camera on a tri-pod. The workout itself seemed like it would have been good, but I only lasted 15 minutes before the poor quality became unbearable."
4,The truth behind that child's face,"I never thought Suzanne Vega was such a fighter, and not literally. One thing that this book will definelly cause you is surprise, a must-read to Suzanne Vega fans that might not please others."
2,Disappointing,"I only wish that those who truly have talent could have poetry published as readily as ""celebrities"" whose talent is at best childish. Not that this book is horrible, I just found it lacking."
1,Where is the talent?,"I work at a library, and we purchased this book just because Suzanne Vega was having a book signing at Borders. Where is the talent in this book? Her short stories lack depth, the poems in her book should remain as song lyrics. She comes off sounding just like some high school wanna-be deep thinker. The only thing I remotely liked in the entire book was her interview as a sixteen year old with the old lady across the street. The rest was junk, sorry. She should let her work remain as music."
1,AWFUL,"Timothy who reviewed this above must have been paid off lol b/c this is without a doubt the worst product i've laid my eyes or fingers on in 10 years of playing guitar. What's wrong with it? You name it.Its slapped together with glue spots all over it.The fretboard feels really strange and rough, with a super high action.It will NOT stay in tune. I actually prayed for it to stay in tune and I don't do that often. It actually smells funny, it smells funny!Take your money and burn it, you would actually have more fun doing that than playing this god forsaken thing."
1,Esteban is a smooth talker!!!!,"Esteban guitars are worth only the cardboard that the back of it is made of!!!!, BEWARE!!!"
4,Beautifully recorded,"This is a CD for those who love classical guitar and are hungry to hear new compositions that give a different ""sound"" to the instrument. Steve's playing is very relax and the result is a sensitive recording."
5,simple effective singing voice development technique,This is an invaluable book that the author ( a voice teacher who passed away seval years ago) has developed. It is a seemingly simplistic method for develeoping a beautiful and strong voice. The technique works alone or along with other techniques taught by a teacher or self. It locates the most comfortable pattern of your own voice and thus allows you to sing more easily and without needing to constantly try to control the muscles of the voice so you can relax and focus on artistic presentation. It's very simple to understand yet surprisingly effective..
1,senile,this movie didn 't make any scent the movie was very sum man get mad because of a appointment please next!
5,An Excellent Source,"Zeynep Celik does an excellent job in summarizing the Ottoman politics in the 19th century and relating the social and economic structure of the empire to Istanbul's architecture and urban planning. The book consists of seven chapters, which include her clear analysis of the regularization of the urban fabric, transportation and some grand schemes proposed by the european architects and planners. She makes references to other european cities, and makes good comparisons for what certain things did/ did not work for the replanning of Istanbul. The book is very easy to read, comprehensive and very illustrative. The maps, diagrams and photographs are very revealing. Great work!"
2,Not his best.,I though that I was going to hear Sala. If you like Jazz you will enjoy this CD. I'm not big on Jazz.
4,Great Family Film!!!,"Im usually an action comedy movie guy, but I saw this along time ago and I watched it a fews ago.This is a great film for the family and worth buying."
4,"Review of the movie ""Lassie""","This is the best of the Lassie movies I have seen, probably because it is modern (1994) compared to the old Lassie movies I watched on TCM. There is a few scenes that have mild language, so you may want to preview this movie before you show it to your family. For most teens and adults, I think this movie is OK. The plot was good, except the bad rancher along with his sons who stole the horses should have been showed to get some kind of punishment for their crime. The acting was better than average. I liked the kid played by Thomas Guiry and the grandfather, played by Richard Farnsworth. The DVD video quality is good. The DVD audio quality is good with no noticeable distortion on my stereo system."
1,B O O O O O O O R I N G !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tom Guiry is at it again... starring in another PATHETICALLY boring film. This guy was a terrible actor as a kid and continues to be as an adult. Maybe some acting lessons to get rid of that awful New Jersey accent?! PLEASE?! Seriously though, this movie is filled with actors who show no emotion, it's set in such drabness that I can not imagine viewing it with it's targeted audience... CHILDREN. A child would have to be comatose to watch this (OR this film could make a child comatose!). Please do your child a favor and leave this one on the shelf!!"
1,Horrible!!!!!,"This is a really bad movie! This movie made me really crazy. There was fighting and stuff in it that was really stupid. I hated it!! Bad, Bad, Bad!!!!"
4,not the tv show but pretty close,definite for fans of the show the dog is amazing and should be given a reweard or something i really enjoyed this movie
3,Brings back memories,"Lassie was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I even got to name our dog ""Lassie"", though not a collie but more a shepherd, she resembled Lassie. So a new version of the movie has helped carry the tradition on some. This isnt' a great movie, but it is enjoyable and heart warming at times. The scenery is beautiful where it was filmed, which is what makes it very special to me. I grew up in the area - the old country store in the movie was about 2 miles from my home and I went to school for a year at the school used in the movie (it's no longer used as a school). The movie also says something to young folks about living and growing up in a more rural area - it is quite different from the city and the family discovers this in the course of the movie. As always, one wishes there was in real life a dog like Lassie who knows everything and always survives the disasters that strike. But that's part of the enjoyment - the fantasy that maybe a dog like that really exists."
4,not the tv show but close,definite for fans of the show the dog is amazing and should be given a reweard or something i really enjoyed this movie
3,Something's missing.,"This wireless desktop has some nice features.The keyboard is great.Not big,but it's not too small either and the keys are responsive and fairly quiet.The mouse fit nicely in my hand and was one of the better mice that I have used.It's also light in weight.The mouse recharging dock doubles as a reciever.Installation was easy.Turn off the pc,plug in the reciever,start up,and wait for Windows XP to recognise the new hardware.The biggest flaw that I found is the lack of an AC adapter for the rechargeable mouse dock.This would work great on a computer that's always on.If you are on dialup and shut your computer off between uses,this recharging system without the AC adapter will not charge your mouse enough."

2,not exactly,The dash mat was good quality but did not fit my rav4 it was not even close. Air vent holes were square when mine ar round and the contour of the mat was not even close. Beware this is not for 2012 model. And even though there was free shipping still cost me to send back.
5,Best horror book ever!,"I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but I really appreciate Masterton's work. And The Pariah is probably his best book, certainly the best of the ones I've read. The setting is very good, the overall atmosphere is making you feel like ""it could have been me"" all the way through. Really good!"
4,Better than I thought,"This is one of the better ghost stories I've read in the past several years. It wasn't as scary as I was expecting, but the imagery was quite memorable. Highly recommended for horror/suspense fans."
2,Boring!,"I usually love reading Graham Masterton but this one was a let down for sure, it was boring throughout the entire book. Not recommended but that's just my opinion. :)"
3,it was alright,"my very first review! I am a big fan and the book was good, just not his best work. It seemed to drift farther from one of my favorites, The Manitou. Part of the fun of reading GM is turning the page, reading through a paragraph, a getting shocked, and then rereading the line to ensure it said what you thought it said. ie the rape scene in ""Night Plague""."
5,Memories...,"I find it incredibly heartening that many other reviewers state how their father turned them onto this album (Hank Jr.'s best in my opinion), as my first memory of hearing it is with my own father. It was a rainy day in Georgia that I'll never forget-the music seemed to quietly reflect the weather (and was enhanced by it). My favorite is no doubt the hard-to-find version of ""Tennessee Stud"". I love the mournful song that shares it's title with the album, ""The Pressure Is On"" and ""Mr. Weatherman"" has a permanent place in my heart. I'm about to order this, as I've lost my copy and need to hear some *good* country music. Great album for any Hank Jr. fan."
2,Starts to go downhill at this point,"In my opinion, Hank Williams Jr. - when he did it right - was about as good as it gets in country music. You listen to his records like ""Old Habits"" and ""Whiskey Bent & Hell Bound"" and it is hard to get much better than that. But with this album Hank Jr started showing glimpses of what would become his future...and it's not good. He has a terrible version of ""The Tennessee Stud"" and everything just seems so overdone. He's best on songs like ""I Don't Care If Tomorrow Never Comes"", ""Ramblin My Shoes"" and ""All My Rowdy Friends Have Settled Down"" - everything else is just filler. And with future albums the filler would get worse until he eventually got to the point he would write things like ""This Ain't Dallas"" and ""Fax Me a Beer"". Too bad, terrible waste of talent."
5,!!!,"These are great curtians! They look so pretty, and when the lights are on in the house they look like x-mas bulbs from outside."
5,Historical landmark articles,"Some of CONTENTS include:COMMENTS:Defense's Death Spiral John HillenEMU to AMU? Zanny Minton BeddoesColombia on the Brink Michael ShifterESSAYSRedefining the National Interest Joseph S. Nye, Jr.The description of article reads: ""NATO's poorly planned adventure in Kosovo has brought a critical question to the fore: just how should Americans define their national interest int he information age?

2,Hackneyed Theme,"I read this book as a courtesy to my old flyfishing partner who gave it to me as a Christmas gift. I could tell from the summary on the dusk jacket that I would probably not like it very much . I was correct. I did not like it very much even though the setting was in my own home State of New Jersey on rivers that I have fished many times myself. I am so tired of flyfishing-as-therapy books. It is a hackneyed theme. Plummer's book is certainly not as bad as Harry Middleton's unreadable, flyfishing-as-therapy book ""The Bright Country"" but Plummer's book is also mercifully shorter. This book should sell as well as (or as poorly as) Plummer's ""Buttercups and Strong Boys."" To summarize my opinion of the book using Plummer's own words (see page 86), in writing the book, Plummer ""was simply going where many others had been, redoing what had already been done many times before."" If one wants to read an entertaining flyfishing-as-therapy book, try ""Fly Fishing through the Midlife Crisis."""
4,Taxation 1-2-3,"As a college Accounting student I found this book extremely useful in explaining the US tax laws in a way I could easily understand. Many ""real-life"" examples make the reading meaningful."
4,Good Book,"Must have, a comprehensive analysis on the history of Rise and Fall of Roman Empire.Zuluchief"
4,Good performances,"This is the dramatization of a real event that took place in Puerto Rico. So this captured my interest as I do not no much about that island and the feelings of its inhabitants. It is quite an atmospheric movie with good acting performances. Kevin Spacey shines in a minor role as a kind of an ""FBI-villain"", Andy Garcia plays a prosecutor and sports a massive beard. Amy Irving is effective in the lead role. My favorite scene is her character's encounter with tha one Garcia plays, who apparently falls in love with her immediately, staggering dumbfounded through the tropical heat. It is an encounter without consequences, romancewise, maybe that's why it stuck to my mind."
5,best ever,"I own this whisk since 10 years and I practicaly use it every time I need a whisk. It gets into the corners of the pots just nice. The flat side helps that sauces and desserts don't get burt on the stove. I love it and recommend it to everybody. Great price at Amazon too, I got mine in Germany and it was more expensive."
3,I give 5-0 season 10 a C+.,This is not the the best CBS can do. They can do much better then this. Seasons 1-9 were much better. Wash outs in color in season 10. And it just does not look right! CBS had this out fast. Come on CBS. Get it right next time as you did in seasons 1-9...Us 5-0 fans want it right! Got it!
1,poorly remastered,have watched all the previous 9 series and this one cannot compare in production quality. will wait as well on season 11 until i hear that it's produced well.
1,Terrible Quality,"The remastered versions of season 1-9 are wonderful, but the quality of season 10 is poor. The dvd box says remastered but I highly doubt this. The shows are very grainy and dark. The one positive thing I can say about season 10 is updated version of the theme song with its electronic drum beat."
5,All fine.,This arrived on time and was fine.This takes too much time. This takes too much time. This takes too much time.
1,Hawaii-Crap O,"I have the first two seasons, and looking forward to the next 10. But if what I have read about season 10 is true, then I'll stop at 9. Why oh why would they do such a great job at the first 9 seasons, then put out such poor quality work for the 10th? Truely Hawaii-Crap O"
4,10th Season Hawaii Five O,Husband and I enjoyed watching the different episodes. As with a Magnum PI purchase we received a disc with a defect. With Hawaii Five O it was on the last disc and made it to where we missed several minutes of the episode we were watching. Very disappointing! Enjoyed the episodes we were able to watch without disruption.
5,WHAT'S ALL THE HYPE?,I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE RECORDING QUALITY IN THIS VOLUME VERSUS PREVIOUS ONES (I OWN THEM ALL).I SUPPOSE IF YOU SIT UP CLOSE TO THE T.V. OR HAVE A VERY LARGE SCREEN T.V. YOU MIGHT NOTICE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT THE QUALITY SEEMED THE SAME AS THE OTHERS TO ME;OR MAYBE I'M JUST TOO OLD TO NOTICE! I WAS HESITANT ON PURCHASING DUE TO SO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS BUT AM GLAD I DID. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEASON 11.
2,Hawaii F-0 Tenth Season,"The DVD Hawaii Five 0 Tenth Season was all scratched up when I received it.Disc #3 will not play at all. I was disappointed because ittook me close to a year to get it. Since I'm one of Amazon's good customer, I think you should send me another one fee of charge."
1,Rip Off,"The tenth season of HFO has absolutely NOT been remastered. I bought this for Christmas thinking that it would be the same quality as all the other seasons. Boy was I wrong. I've seen VHS tapes taken from old television reruns that look and sound better than these dvd's. This whole season reeks of being thrown together overnight, and they want $37.00 for this garbage! I feel like I've been totally scammed here. This effort would be worth 5 or 6 dollars at best. Save your money, don't get ripped off.Edit: They have since raised the price to $39.00. Nice."
2,Poor Picture & Sound Quality,CBS Paramount should be ashamed for releasing such poor quality DVD's. The 10TH season has definitely not been remastered. The same thing has happened with seasons 1 & 2 of Cannon. I think CBS Paramount should re-release Hawaii Five-O 10TH season with remastered episodes. They should do the same thing with Cannon.
5,brilliant! american independent filmmaking at its finest!,"i saw this film at the cinevegas film festival with dennis hopper and some people from sundance and i was blown away. there is much less dialogue than most american movies and the story is told, well...visually. this film respects its audience and does what few american movies can do...show something new. i recommended it highly as it gave me new insight into the graffiti subculture as well as the disaffected youth movement, punk and other subcultures and a great story of the friendship/relationship between two young boys."
3,Inspiring Simplicity,"Graffiti Artist - 3 1/2 *'sThe simplicity of this film is inspiring; minimal dialogue, no over the top drama, just an artist creating, a kid ""being"". I feel the film makers did a tremendous job of creating this believable reality and expressing such emotional depth with such minimal verbiage. An invisible kid living on the streets of Seattle, gifting society with his art that most would consider ""worthless"" Graffiti."
1,ehh a little to for my tastes,"i like graffitti movies so i bought this ,and right off the bat it has tha cheesy graff flick feel, but is put together good almost like BOMB THE System ,but this was before that.it tries to show the relationship between graffti art and gang graffitti and the violence between the two,hehhh.but sooner than you think it turns into a an homo-erotic love storie about two juvenille boys , in the streets,its has a preachy vibe and its really a weak plot. sad ending, ive given the director his due for taking on this story like thisbut it think the majority of its target audience wont relate to the homosexual charcters..get Bomb The System Instead,"
5,Superb study,no book comes even close to this one in exploring the dynamics of communal violence in Bombay. brilliantly informed by extensive field work.
2,A world away from another destination,"After Another Destination I was prepared to rave about Norum to all my friends whether they wanted to listen or not. I shut up quick when this came out.Turgid songwriting, meandering tunes that go nowhere, and even if they went somewhere you wouldn't want to go with them. Lacklustre production job and the whole thing - right down to the cover - is sort of reminiscent of a really boring party.Not even the wonderful and cutting Manic Distortion can save this though on his subsequent live album some of these tunes have life breathed into them."
3,An Okay Album.,"I bought this album quite some time ago and have never paid it much attention. I'm a fan of Total Control (his solo debut) and his work with Europe, but I'm not very big on this release. I've listened to Worlds Away only a handful of times, but it's not a bad album. The vocals and musical direction are not to my taste, but John plays very good as usual--I can't shake the belief that his playing isn't as European sounding as it used to be with Europe and on his solo debut though. There's no doubt that John Norum is a great guitar player and a personal favorite. He's one of the best. Worlds Away is okay, but Total Control and his work on The Final Countdown are my preferences."
3,Kelly's review is dead on,"Kelly said it right -- this is a CD with great potential, but it just seems to lack emotion. Also, some of the tracks sound just too similar. The guitar work is very good in places, but dry in others. And you get the feeling Keeling had no chance whatsoever to exercise his vocal talents and range -- he's so much better on the first 2 Baton Rouge albums, and MSG's Unforgiven."
2,Beating Heart,"Seeking a new start in life, Evan's mother moves into a dilapidated house with him and his kid sister, Libby. As the trio begins to make themselves felt, a presence starts to awaken, taking notice of Evan in particular. Once upon a time, Cora lived in this house, but died very young. She begins to believe that Evan is her long lost love, and her feelings begin to intrude on his life, changing his perceptions to a degree, and confusing the boy. Both ghost and youth have something to learn from each other in this odd little book. Cora's thoughts are rambling as she observes Evan's teen angst. This is not a Ghost and Mrs. Muir in reverse. There is no actual conversation between the ghost and human, the novel simply records how their awareness of each other changes the two. The ending is uplifting, but it takes a while to get there.Amanda Killgore"
3,Nice pans - do not put in the dishwasher,"These pans have worked well. They are light and seem good quality. The largest pan is so huge! It actually wouldn't fit in our oven very well, so we haven't used that one. The cakes turned out great. The only thing - and this could be my mistake - is that when I put them in the dishwasher, they got discolored and it looked like I should not have done that. I didn't see anywhere in the instructions that these were not dishwasher safe, but please note that they are not. We used them even with the discoloration, but I just thought it was strange. That said, I could have missed something in the instructions. Overall, we are fairly happy with them."
1,Where is the creativity?,"Nice and simple, but so completely western if you ask me. It has more of the English tearoom effect than the Japanese love for the beautiful in the simple things of life. Japanese dishes are so creative and breathtaking in their simple beauty--why are most of the options for sale here in the US so boring? I have resorted to making my own sushi dishes, and I can tell you they're a lot more interesting than these. If you want something fast get these. but if you want personality keep looking. let me know if you find anything really good."
1,Not too pleased...,"I needed this disc for radio submission however I was looking for the remixes, not the original.I'm not sure if the disc I received was by error on the shippers part or on Amazon's part, but according to the image in this listing and the matching image on the release in the Discogs catalogue this was to be a Maxi-CD single. What I received was the promo disc that went out to radio stations back in 1988 with 2 tracks on it:Track 1 - Straight Up (original radio edit)Track 2 - Opposites Attract (original radio edit)DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU CONFIRM THAT IT'S THE MAXI CD SINGLE CONTAINING ALL 4 MIXES OF ""STRAIGHT UP"" AHEAD OF TIME! Don't say you weren't warned ;)"
2,Might be good for some,"I bought this album on the strength of the single, Hypocrite.Hypocrite is fantastic. Driving beat, big guitars, fantastic lyrics sung with utter conviction.The rest of the album is, to me, woeful. Dreary, lacking energy, similar sounding and boring. It's surprising that a song as good as hypocrite shares an album with the rest of it.I can't accept that this is pure shoegazer, as I like Curve and Swervedriver, who are meant to be 'gazers.Bottom line: if you like Nirvana, Curve, Jale, Pumpkins, Swervedriver, or anything with loud guitars, then frankly buy it for Hypocrite. If you like softer stuff, then the other reviews are probably more helpful to you ;)"
3,Split a Letdown,"The album Split is a letdown, though certainly worth buying for Lush fans. It would not serve well as an introduction to the band for new listeners.With the exceptions of standout tracks ""Blackout,"" Lit-up,"" and ""Starlust"" most of the album seems to lazily drift with an almost New Age sound. The edge and energy are missing in Split that made their other albums, in particular Lovelife and Spooky, so great. Split sounds too much like Cocteau Twins at their worst."
5,Sigh.,"It just tears me up that the band is finished. I've seen them live several times. ""Sweetness and Light"" from the Gala album is my all-time favorite song. Hearing it live is an experience I wish I could re-live endlessly. Lovelife and Undertow (tracks 5 and 8 from Split) are my next favorite Lush songs. I both respect and regret the band's decision to break up in the wake of the drummer's suicide."
5,Lush inmate,"My, and many others, favorite Lush-album.Turn it on and you simply can`t turn it off. Lush paralizes body and mind. Welcome to Lush`s prison!"
1,Worst customer service ever!,"I bought this tv from another retailer in Feb of 2006. In October 2006 the remote died. Being still under a year I contacted the company. I expected the same response I get from other companies when there's a problem.""We are so sorry, we'll get you a new remote right away."" WRONG!!!These jokers kept me hanging on for 6 months. Every time I called it was another song and dance. Absolutely the worst customer service ever. I own a business and will make it sure that every customer I have will never buy from this company. You may have better luck buying through Amazon. They seem to want good customer relations. Avoid contacting seller directly. They are useless."
3,A Big Problem,"My Akai LCT2060 cannot be programmed to operate from my Dish controller, unlike all of my other associated equipment. Otherwise, it is a good set."
2,Irritating,"This is the worst dinosaur CD out there the songs are dull and annoying. Heres a rundown of a few songs: out there goes on too long, drawerings once you hear this you'll turn off the cd, get me should have been faster not the same has a good 6 seconds. The only good songs are hide, I aint sayin and start choppin. Whatever I didnt meantion Its an ok song(s)."
5,A work of art!,"this is one of dinosaur jr's best albums! this indie rock band has NEVER ceased to release the BEST tunes! this is a great album....especially ""Out There"" and ""What Else Is New"". A GREAT ALBUM!"
3,"Well, ...","I love Dinosaur Jr., but find this album quite uneven. When J. Mascis sticks to his own trademark sound (folk music set to loud guitar and John Bonham drums) as in ""Out There"" or ""Get Me"", it is brilliant. When he tries to go just on lyrics/voice, as in ""Not The Same"" or ""I'm Going Home"", it falls flat. That is not to say he can't or shouldn't deviate - the backup singer in ""Get Me"" is an unexpected touch that works well. I just think you gotta play your strengths. ""Green Mind"" is a much better effort."
4,"It's hard to pick a favorite, but...","I had heard tracks from Green Mind first, but Where You Been was the first DJ album I really absorbed and loved. I mean...you know ten seconds in it's gonna rock. Some of the songs are rather chill though. ""Out There"" is a great opener, and I might like ""Start Choppin'"" even more. I'm sure some fans of the early stuff don't dig this album as much, but now that DJ is active again, this could really be considered the mid-years. Another all-time fave of mine is ""Goin' Home"". You'll easily enjoy this album if you like Without A Sound, Green Mind or Hand It Over. I have the vinyl. It's almost frame-worthy."
3,Hendrix via Pavement,"3 1/2J's croaked vocals may have lost some of their luster and things tend to repeat themselves in the latter half, but WYB is still the rockin good time I remember it as, with few indie groups being able to incorporate well rendered guitar solos into the proceedings as effectively."
1,Returned not honored yet!,I received the wrong car charger and I sent it back for replacement. As of December 23rd I hadn't received the replacement yet!I hope they honor fheir word!
2,Just Don't Get the Adoration,"I mean, ""The Open Window,"" was a solid story, even with such a predictable plot, but the others in this volume just didn't do it for me. Rather outdated, old chap. I just don't get the adoration."
5,Professionalism in the 21st century,"Stracher has written a brilliant, insightful view into modern professionals. I take exception to the reviewers who found this book unemotional and dry: it is this very tone that makes the book so much more believable. Passionate denounciation of the process will only make the main character sound like some whining kid. As an auditor in a big accounting, firm, I can confirm that auditing firms are similar to law firms. People who have been there will read this book, nod and smile (bitterly and knowingly).Great stuff, Cameron! Can't wait for your next book!"
2,Stracher's Complaints - All the Whining Without the Raw Liver,"Stracher's book is a fairly boring whine-fest. He comes across as a silly young man, who went from college to law school without stopping to take the time to determine if law school was right for him. Then, after law school, off he immediately went to take a job as an associate at an enormous law firm, and was ultimately surprised to find himself miserable. Stracher's insights into the world of law are mundane and simple. It takes him three years to figure out he took the wrong job. He (and the reader) would have been much better served if he had engaged in some introspection prior to applying to law school, and again prior to taking a job, instead of thoughtlessly following a path, and then whining that he doesn't like where he has found himself."
3,Someone who found his way into the wrong profession,"As is apparent from the highly polarized reviews below, your reactions to this book will probably depend largely on your expectations. This is a well-written, quick, reasonably entertaining read. As a critique and commentary on the legal profession, it's whiny and shallow. You come away wondering how someone this bright could have bumbled into the world of work with such apparent naivete. But those planning careers in the law, or just interested in how Big Law works, will still benefit from Stracher's vividly drawn on-the-scene report."
2,"Stracher is an overpaid whiner, but he writes well.","As a first year law student at NYU considering a career in a large firm, I put Double Billing on my Christmas list. I received it and started reading right away.At first I was impressed, but after a while I got disgusted with the whiny quality that pervades it. Big firm life may be hellish, but that's what the big paychecks are for. Listening to Stracher whine and snivel about his long hours and lack of positive reinforcement gets old fast, especially when you think of the many overworked and UNDERpaid workers in this country, many of whom labor in jobs that actually put their health or lives at risk.The book's only redeeming quality is Stracher's ability to write well."
4,Decent book,"This is a pretty decent book. It's not completely non-fiction but the author does state that its a compilation of his experiences. It's quite amusing and kept me interested, though the title is much more exciting than the actual story."
3,"Q. Your money or your life? A. I'm thinking, I'm thinking!","(Apologies to Jack Benny.)Newly minted lawyers from the country's top law dozen-or-so law schools can make six figures right out of school working for New York's powerhouse law firms by spending seventy-hour work weeks doing mind-numbing drudgery. Is it worth it? That's the question in this book. Unfortunately, the question is mostly just posed, and the author never makes a real run at answering it.The book does do a good job of stripping some of the glamour away from big-firm practice. New lawyers considering big-firm practice should understand that the big paychecks come with a price tag. If they read ""Double Billing"" they'll know that."
5,Great book,"This is a great book for anyone thinking of a law career, or just interested in how law is practiced at big corporate law firms. The writing is breezy and clever, and the characters are vivid and well-described.I take issue, however, with the review posted on Aug. 28. As lawyers know, Martindale Hubbell only lists the jobs an attorney chooses to list. If this reviewer cares to discover where Mr. Stracher worked, I suggest he read the October 1998 American Lawyer where the book was first excerpted."
2,interesting subject -- terrible writer,Unfortunately most of this 200 page book is filler -- everything could have been summed up neatly in 10 pages without the repitition.
2,Poor guy- all that work and only 6 figures,"Basically a waste of time. It's a couple hundred pages of stuff that anyone working or planning to work at a large firm should already know. Here's the book in a nutshell:I worked hard. Some of the work was excessive and unnecessary. I got paid a lot and now I'm complaining about it!There you go, no need to read the book."
2,Double Billing is guilty of false advertising!,"I purchased double billing while delayed by weather in Salt Lake City. The cover of the book bills it as an expose of ""double billing"" and loaded with ""sex"" and ""lies."" The only ""sex"" in the book was the implied relationship between an associate and a paralegal (not even enough for a PG-13 rating). While ""double billing"" is implied, the author never explains who is double billing or how it is done. The fact that the main character is never able to explain why his office mate consistently bills massive amounts of hours is a good indication that the author never learned the tricks of billing during his years of practice or simply did not want to explain how. The book is a good beginning, and very well written, but scratches at the surface of problems with big law firms. One week at my law firm would be more exciting than several years at C & C!"
4,"For The Serious Entrepreneur, Not The Dreamer","If you're looking for some magic book or mysterious plan that will instantly make you rich without any work, this is not it. In fact, none exists. However, if you're looking for an honest, realistic look at how to make money from home in mail order, with a little work and effort on your part, this book will be a great help. Lance and Roger show you the real ""secrets"" about how to build your own profitable mail order business. In fact, they reveal many strategies and tactics that most would keep a secret. A refreshing look at the profitable world of mail order."
2,Padded to the Max,"I purchased this book to gleen some insight and specific guidance into the world of Home-Based Mail Order Business. What I got instead was a book that spent way too much print on common sense things like, ""be patient,it will pay off"" and ""do your homework and success will follow"",instead of the real bread and butter specifics of starting a Mail Order Business. I knew very little about Mail Order before reading the book and after reading it, still know very little. The book also appeared to be a low budget effort as there were numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout."
4,KITCHEN TABLE GOLDMINE,"This book offers a fabulous step-by-step method for making money by mail. Its easy to miss some of the underlieing tones like how the authors explore, in depth, the art of advertising and how it is used to sell products. Anyone who is not that sharp may see only fluff (as another reviewer did).Although this book is written primarily for the ' business opportunity seeker' crowd, its universal methods can be applied to any products sold by mail. As one who makes money in mail order, it is obvious to me that the authors have actually 'been there, done that' as they reveal some long hidden truths about the market. Although the publisher or authors could have done a much better job proofreading, the gramitical errors do not take away from the gems of truth revealed in this book."
4,A home based mail order business can be fun & profitable!,This is a good book for anyone who wishes to start a mail order home-based business. It is even very useful to someone who is already experienced in the mail order trade like myself!
4,a thorough and inspiring text,"this small book contains a wealth of information about the life-science of ayurveda, the holistic health tradition of india. information ranging from the philosophical underpinnings of ayurveda to how to incorporate it into everyday life is presented clearly. the book is well-written and inspiring. i find myself reading it again and again."
4,What's my Name? RINGO!!,"This 3 CD set does an admirable job capturing the spirit of Ringo's live sets with his various All Star bands over past summers. I've seen a lot of concerts in my life and one of the most special was singing along with Ringo and the entire audience to Yellow Submarine. The live version of that song reflects the love Ringo's audience has for the man and his effervescent personality. My only criticism of the CD is in the mixing. Transitions from song to song are rough. I suppose the reason is that the material spans lots of concerts over several years yet technology has advanced to the point where that could have been done seamlessly. Still, I love to put the CD in the changer and sing along with all the rock stars that play with Ringo. He has aged gracefully and has lots of fun with his fans. This CD shows just how much fun!"
1,Doesn't work,"I mixed a 2.5 lb batch of birdseed with this stuff and I followed the directions to a T (add oil, wait 20 min, etc). This simply does not work. My squirrels weren't even phased, they just munched away on my birdseed like nothing had happened. So, I doubled the amount of Squirrel Away. The squirrels still ate it. Then, I tripled the amount of Squirrel Away. The squirrels *still* ate it.Bottom line: Squirrel Away simply doesn't work. Save your money."
4,"Star Wars: Dark Nest, Book 2","It is a Star Wars novel. If you are just starting reading the novels, I would not start here, otherwise, read on. If you are srarting, I would go with Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn and go form there. You will here the score in the background, it is that good."
3,Lacks direction,"I'm still not sure about the ""Dark Nest Trilogy."" ""The Unseen Queen"" isn't bad. It's just not good. Not enough happens to give the story direction. Luke and Han are captured by the Killiks. Leia and Saba are captured by the Galactic Alliance.Jacen discovers something from Tenel Ka that changes his course. This is a character I no longer recognize. Jaina and Zekk follow him against their better judgement. I don't understand that. Can someone who's read this explain to me how their plan is supposed to provoke the Chiss to attack the Killiks? The logic just doesn't follow.Jaina and Zekk are Joiners. How does the hive not know what they are thinking? Isn't that a security risk? No one is worried?And what in the worlds is happening between Luke and Lomi Plo? How is it that Lomi Plo is so much more powerful than Luke? It's not even a fair fight.It's the middle book. There is no ending. It should point us somewhere, but I'm not sure where. Please let it end soon. I can't stand bugs."
4,Entry Level Poetry,"I wouldn't describe this book as a best of American Outlaw poets but it is a great piece to bring the youth into this area of American writing. Some of the pieces are not the best that has been written by certain poets, but then again we all put out less than grand work sometimes. The book does convey the sentiments and mentality of this group of individuals quite well though. If you have only read Robert Frost and Walt Whitman and found yourself wanting something that bites a little harder this is a great place to start. Who knows even the old hats at Outlaw and urban poetry might find a gem in here that they can't do without."
2,Outlaws? Please...,"""Official acceptance is the one unmistakable symptom that salvation is beaten again, and is the one surest sign of fatal misunderstanding, and is the kiss of Judas"" --James AgeeOut of all the names in this book, there are abou 2 1/2 ""outlaws."" Most of these writers had friends in the right places, studied at the right schools, knew the right people. They were as much outlaws to poetry as Mother Theresa was to religion. It's a ridiculous title for a book that doesn't live up to it."
5,A Shot in the Arm for American Poetry,"The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry is the most interesting and exciting anthology I have come across in many years. As a teacher of English at both the high school and college level, I am constantly looking for a more modern and exciting way to introduce poetry to my students. This anthology is what I've been looking for. It has a myriad of inovative new writers aa well as some older ones who were ahead of their time. And, most importantly, it makes poetry fun and available to the students of today. Well done, Mr. Kaufman, well done!"
1,If I didn't have an imagination this would be good,"While this collection does provide some insights into late twentieth-century coutner-cultural movements, the work selected is more indicative of their faults rather than their strengths. The volume amounts to very little more than page after page of narcissistic ramblings from individuals too lazy and caught up in being an ""artist"" to take the time to revise and hone their work. While political and/or revolutionary poetry, with a strong eye toward all the insipid isms of our culture, is needed and welcomed there is no need to shun craft and artistry, or even-gasp-tradition, for the sake of ""saying something."" The lines in these poems are bland, they more often tell than show, the imagination is rarely challenged. If you must read this book focus on Sapphire, Ai, Norman Mailer, and Williams and skim the rest."
5,The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry is brilliant!,"The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry by Alan Kaufman is a brilliant anthology, maybe the greatest anthology of new American poetry I've ever read. Part of its genuis is that""Outlaw"" breaks new ground, introducing poets unknown to the mainstream while showing how they belong to the Outlaw lineage begun by WC Williams and later the Beats. And I like the way ""Outlaw"" mixes up the poetry with mini-histories of poets live's and scenes and has lots of wild pictures of poets and motorcycles and cafes and what not. That's great. This book announces a new canon in Americn poetry, has the depth and insight to be taught in classrooms even, but I bet every dreaming kid too from New York to Wichita to LA is going to read this book as a manifesto of revolt and liberation and to get up and do something with your life, be a poet of life!"
4,a surprising find,"Great bathroom read except that you might find yourself ""wanting"" to go to the bathroom more often, just to read more. This is a fine sampling of off-the-beaten path poetry by poets that just aren't celebrated even in the most liberal of poetry classes. Some of the poems will stick with you years after you are exposed to it and others slip from your memory once you have spoken/read the last line. The poets and poems aren't logically organized but this is one book where it might be better to just flip the page, reading where it lands open."
2,Melange Faux Pa,"Is to current radical poetry what Ronald Reagan movies were to Amerikan idiom, laced with pop-star blather and stage-pyrotecnics. More like a trip to The Gap than the lower east side. Maybe Spielberg's outlaws, but none of the outlaws I know are reading it.Cheers."
3,I think you forgot something...,"This is a five star book, as others have mentioned, except for one thing: there is not a word from good old Charles Bukowski. I'm not trying to negate the worth of the book (or any or the works contained therein), but how can you have an outlaw bible of poetry without Bukowski? Seems like one hell of an oversight to me, therefore, in response to its stark incompleteness, I give this book only three stars.In this book there are works by many poets who I had not heard of previous to my purchase of it. If an ommision as big as leaving out Bukowski is acceptable to the editor, Alan Kaufman, how are we to know what else he's simply skipped at our expense?"
4,OK for me,"Bought one in Brugge a couple of years ago. It finally quit, so have new one. Expensive but will use it. Eggs come out cooked just the way I wish. Shipment was unexpectedly quick."
2,Review,"I was not happy. The last time I ordered this product I received a bottle 2x the size for 1/2the price of what I paid. Inaddition, the sprayer doesn't work"
4,This toy is okay,"The deal is, you have this neopet you have to take care of. You need to feed it about three times a day and they like to play with their toys. You also have to make sure your neopet doesn't get sick (this will hardly ever happen if you feed it enough). You play games to earn neopoints and you use the points to buy things for your neopet.This game has a few flaws. It gets boring pretty easily and there isn't much you can do with your neopet. All you do is feed it a few times a day and earn neopoints. I would say that if you want to buyit, you should. If you're not sure whether to buy it or not, don't. A game that is better than this is: Tamagotchi which you can get for Gameboy. I would reccomend that one instead."
5,"Fun, education all in one???","it was my birthday, and my sister had gottenb me the medrill noepets world! I was always on neopets, and my fav. place was medrill, when i got it, i didn't kno what to do, but it came with a ixi, lupe and draik. It let me set the time and tell about my pets. It was alot diffrent then neopets, as on the the duluxe neopet midrill, you can tell you pets to sleep, and all! So itsa a mix of neopets and Virtual pets in one!!"
3,"If you collect Neopets items, you may as well get this, too.","If you don't already have one of the smaller Pocket Neopets, start with one of them. This one didn't really ""work"" for us. Maybe it's different for older children whose parents and schools let them bring handheld games wherever they go, but for us it was not possible to maintain the VirtuPets on a school day. Compared to the smaller pocket pets that had the slot machines, there seems to be no quick way to build up points to buy food and toys for the pets and even the three-fer games seem to be harder. So the young person in our home lost interest and put this toy on the shelf. As for quality, it's OK but the covers pop off easily and the rare item code didn't work on the website. There is actually some educational value in this toy: watching the Neopets pack off into the sunset if you don't feed them often enough gives one a life lesson about keeping commitments and paying consequences for missing deadlines."
2,...,"I have the regular pocket neopet and have kept the pet alive for a very long time.This, on the other hand,is the worst toy(By the way, I have the Fairieland version).I can't keep the pets alive for more than about two days. I try feeding them when their health points are low and after their fed,the points go even lower!!The games are also ridiculously hard and unlike the regular pocket game, their is no quick way to earn neopoints, exept for the wheel of excitement,which you can only play once every 2 hours,and you have to pay to spin it):(!!!!)"
3,Fun but with flaws....,It is quite fun yet the neopets die much to quickly then you would expect. I also ahve the little one too (Kougra). I have left it alone for a day or too and when i return it is just fine. I once went to sleep with theis one nearby and when i woke up i found he had run away. So thats what iI think about this toy. It is very cute with the little duddes though...
3,Neopets,I like this but a love the web site better here is how to get there www.neopets.com/refer.phtml?username=gamemanallit is a nice toy
4,Cute!,"My younger brother (age 10) bought this Deluxe world instead of the regular Handheld Neopet toys. It was only a few dollars more expensive, and it came with three miniture 3D neopets instead of one. I completely fell in love with it! You can name your little digital pet, feed it, play games with it, earn trophies, shop, and put your little cutie to bed! It never fails to keep us entertained!"
5,WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?,"It's a great toy! I got it for my 13th B-day... i know the graphics are not soo good but what could you expect for 20$? It has 6 great games including Turmac Roll, Kiss the mortog, Ultimate Bullsye, Turtle Racing and a new game Negg drop! As you rule each level you get more NP's and a trophy! It's perfect for loooong trips!!! Comes with 3 neopets, a bank account, 3 shops (including petpet shop) also i hear people are saying that its hard to get np but if try hard you will manage to get enought np's to buy things and make your neopets happy so they dont run away (happened to me only 2 times)."
1,Not a good toy,"Dear Person who is reading this opinion, according to my studies i believe that this toy is not a good thing to purchase. Why? because i think its fake... i got a toy that is a lot different. it was the same model ""neopets deluxe meridell"" but the inside is a lot different and the colors of the neopets are fake ( not original for their species. when i bought mine it had 3 AA batteries included. Thank You"
5,The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music,I am a freelance writer for Latino oriented publications and have found Ramiro Burr's book an invaluable reference and resource tool when writing about Tejano music.
5,Tejano Music in English,"I find the content of this book very enlightening and hopefully Ramiro will help the American people find the joy in the music that I have. I have listened to Mexican/Tejano music for the past 10 years and have never enjoyed music like I have since ""discovering"" this music. A lot of American people have no understanding behind the music or the lyrics. Ramiro writes about all of that in a way that explains how an American such as myself can come to love music that is not in their native language. He is passionate about the subject and was quoted in an excellent piece in March 2000 issue of Hispanic magazine regarding Mexican/Tejano music. Keep up the good work."
2,Mildew Odor,"The book was in relatively good conditioin (small tear on cover), however the book smelled moldy like it had been in a basement."
5,Had this as a child,My friends mom gave this too me when my turtle died.....I still have it 50 years later passing it on
5,Great book,"Great book, as a pastry school student currently in a internship I find this book informative and educational. Anyone in the business who wants history on their profession this is a great place to start"
2,Making of a Pastry Chef,I was under the impression that it would include secret techniques and recipes for people who want to become pastry chefs. It turned out to be more of a story.
4,"Good recipes, medicore writing","This book is great for people totally unfamiliar with the world of pastry and baking. However, for those of us who have a fairly good idea about what it's like to be a pastry chef and are looking for the nitty gritty, every day details, this isn't the way to go. The writing often reads like a jounrel article; it lacks emotion and depth. But, it has lots of absolutely delicious recipes and some pretty entertaining anecdotes. I wouldn't discourage the passionate dessert maker from buying it."
3,Informative,"This book is full of information from the people who have found success in the world of pastry. They tell about what training they received and how helpful it was to their careers, what their day is like, how they come up with new ideas, and what they believe the future of pastry is.The writing style lacks snap and, occasionally, clarity. The content of the chapter doesn't always exactly match the chapter title. But it is still a good resource for someone who is interested in the pastry business because the chefs that were interviewed for the book really love what they do. Their passion comes through, which I found to be inspiring."
5,"Bullies, Targets & Witnesses","A grass roots, comprehensive look at a pervasive problem, spanning the childhood spectrum and moving into the adult world! SuEllen and Paula have stumbled onto an issue which permeates society. They define bullying, give specific examples and cast the human interest approach to finding solutions! A must read for parents and educators..."
5,"Bullies, Targets & Witnesses: Helping Children Break the Pai","As a School Health Educator working with children of all ages, my emphasis is violence prevention. In fact, bullying programs make up 90% of my work throughout Missouri. In this book, SuEllen and Paula have crystalized my ideas about what is essential to teach people of all ages about peer abuse.I was particularly impressed with the extensive references to research, and the countless stories that support the ideas in their book. If we are to help children take their place in society as adults, we must equip them with appropriate skills and information. These ideas are neatly laid out for readers in Bullies, Targets & Witnesses. I gained a greater understanding of the underlying complexities of each role in a variety of bullying situations, and ways to handle them.Parents, educators and counselors who truly care about creating a kinder generation to follow in our footsteps will find Bullies, Targets & Witnesses a very useful resource."
5,Brilliant Electrodisco,"This is a brilliant piece of synth-disco from the early 1980's, just when disco was transforming itself into Hi-NRG. With its strong melody, captivating beat (very fast bpm) and rousing female vocals, it will remain a dancefloor favorite. No wonder it's found its way onto so many disco and hi-NRG compilations."
4,My toddler loves it.,"The only reason I'm giving this DVD 4 stars is that I prefer Steve to Joe, but this is a wonderful DVD, full of fun images and music that any child will love. (Parents, too.)"
3,Like the earlier blue's clues,When I purchased this I didn't realize that it was the later blue's clues without steve. It just doesn't seem to be the same. I don't think my son really cares that it's different but the format is a little different. He seems to get a little more distracted as with the earlier ones he would sit through it.
4,Great DVD,"My kids just love this dvd. They're 5 and 3 and walk around the house singing ""Colors Colors Everywhere...."" It's a great learing experience for shapes and colors!"
1,"New host ""Joe"" is TERRIBLE!","My son refused to watch this! He cried through 15 minutes of it until I put on an older Blue's Clues that had the regular host, ""Steve"". I had to return it.Be careful! The new ""Joe"" dvds say ""Steve Burns"" on them, but read the whole description, and look for any mention of ""Joe""."
2,"Come back, Steve!","My younger sons (ages 3 yrs and 19 months at this writing) live for Blue's Clues. My older son (now 10) and two nephews (now 8 and 5) grew up with Steve and Blue). But the ""Joe"" videos make my kids run away - the youngest screams whenever he so much as hears ""Joe""'s voice. He's just plain creepy, albeit in a wholesome yet moronic way.Of course, this is just a caveat against the ""Joe"" factor - if your kids can get past the creepiness of this pale shadow of Steve Burns, the episodes themselves are pretty good - pretty much the standard BC fare. But if this pretender to the Blue throne makes your children cry and your teeth grind and intestines clench and such, then stick to the USDA Certified Steve episodes."
4,pretty good dvd,This is a pretty good dvd. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is the dvd dosen't just play through all 4 episodes. It just plays the 2 with Joe. If you want to see the 2 episodes with Steve you have to go into another menu option. I bought this dvd for a road trip and it was frustrating that I had to climb around the car after 2 episodes so my daughter could see the rest of the dvd.
4,Good.,"An interesting critique of modern ethics, it takes most aspects of morality and kicks them in the teeth, as it were.A young and not yet polished style that bears great potential. I look forward to more boks by the author."
5,Spiritual Health,This book kept my attention until I finished it. Alot of my questions were answered that I have been wondering about. It goes very closely with biblical principals and is easy to understand. I am glad that I bought the book.
1,Confused,"terry is all over the place in this book. he says weird things. he comes up with notions put forth, but not fully explored. theres so many holes in this book. i suspect there's way better books on this subject. theres got to be. i really cannot believe a publisher printed this book. i almost want to write to him. its so poorly constructed that if i did write to him, i'd yell at him. its not that its ""evil,"" but how poorly written and constructed it is. i only read 75% of it, and i had to put it down. i guess everyone has a mortgage to pay and a car payment. terry is confused. i feel bad for him. and i've prayed to the most high, the god of abraham for clarity for him. the one im physically descended from."
3,Ok if you're in a hurry,"I haven't had a chance to go through the 1 hour session, but the under 30-minute session went so quickly that I almost needed to hit pause in order to get into one position before she changed to the next. If you are in a hurry and want something that will give you a bit of a workout but not give you deep stretches, the quick start might be fine. However, if you are looking for a video with a short routine that allows you to stretch well, this is not one that I would recommend."
1,Why so expensive?,"I know this isn't a blog, but I'd like a reviewer to address the cost of 200. for this dvd set?"
3,Great Past Time Read,"I really enjoyed this book because of the main characters--middle and upper middle class African Americans, a segment of the American population that you would not normally know about unless they're athletes, or involved in some of other form of entertainment (you may be familiar with this echelon of society if you are a regular reader of such periodicals as Ebony, Upscale, Black Enterprise, etc.). This book was a great past time read, though. My only objection is that the characters were were not as developed as they could have been. I wanted to know MORE about these characters. I believe this book could easily been (I use the term ""easily"" loosely because I'm not a writer, so maybe it wasn't so easy) another 100+ pages. I would still recommend it highly. It's been a couple of years since I read it so I don't remember every detail--but I would take the time to read it again."
2,Come Back Stronger,"I applaud Lee & Anthony for their 1st attempt for as writing novels are concerned but, I would like for them to come back stronger with a 2nd. The setting & characters are interesting but the storyline is weak (could be sharper, crisp) & gradually loses the reader's interest. I read this one off & on for months."
3,It was a quick read,"It was a quick read...kept me from watching television. Was it the greatest? NO! I'm glad I checked it out from the library. I saw so many opportunities where one could be sitting on the edge of the seat waiting for the next page, paragraph or word. But alas...when you got there...it wasn't what you'd anticipated. I guess I was expecting more and was left dry (w/o the high)!"
3,Pretty Decent Read,"I must admit that I picked up this book several times and put it down. Partly because of schoolwork, but mostly because it was slow in the beginning. I think the authors developed the characters fairly well, but you didn't get to see them do a lot of stuff (if that makes sense). Most of the action took place in the last 50 pages of the book. Those pages were the page-turners for me. Otherwise, I was not overly impressed with the book. It is a good read if you don't have much else to read, but I found my attention being distracted too easily. I had to make myself sit down and get through the first 150 pages. The last 75-100 pages were the best and that's why I gave it three stars."
3,An alright book...,"I saw a blurb on this book mentioned in a magazine and it sounded like something that I would like. But much like the trailer for a movie, the blurb depicted the best parts.I can say that it was a fairly quick read and the characters could have been better if developed a little bit more.I was also surpised that Hyperion didn't do a better job of editing the book.My advice is wait a few months until it's marked down."
2,In need of serious editing,"this book has a lot going for it, but it's in need of some cutting and pasting, in my opinion. Did it have an editor? It reads to me like someone rushed it into print and didn't take the time to read it through and smooth it out.I did like the tone of the book, and the dialogue, and there is something unique about it. But there is something missing, something that makes it feels as if it just falls short of being really good.I was disappointed."
2,Not a good book....sorry,"I bought this book discounted, and am still upset with the amount of money I spent on it. Simply put, This book was not good. The characters were not realistic or developed at all. The story line was contrite, and juvenile. You would think with two authors, the twist and turns in the book would be more interesting, but it seemed to make the book more confusing and unreal. If these ladies wanted to set a standard in the literary world, they sadly missed their mark. I don't recommend this book at all."
2,"Not Moved, its OK","This novel is soooo ""dishy"" and midway thru the plot became predictable. No disrespect but I was not moved by the characters or the plot. In fact I thought all the characters except 2 of them...Trenton and the ""dl"" rapper interesting and worthy of a book of their own. I am glad that the authors cashed on their ""celebrity"" to hype this book cause I would not encourage anyone to buy this one. This is definitely a summer-vacation book."
1,Talk to the hand,"This book is really bad! The book is laden with stereotypical characters who are shallow and predictable. The writing is painful. I am halfway through, and will not finish the book. It is so bad it had the opposite effect of lulling me to sleep...it kept me up instead. Tandy, Manny, Trenton and all other characters you deserved better authors."
2,I expected more,"I actually read the entire book despite my initial misgivings... I kept hoping that that it would get better but it didn't. There was so much hype surrounding this book which can only be described as ""basic."" There was nothing unique about the story and the novel lacked depth and creativity. I just thought it was going to be so much more..."
2,Doesn't grab ya!!,"I wish I got this from the library instead of paying for it. I finished it just to see how it would end but the story line was weak. I won't go into what the book was about because you can read that elsewhere if you want and I get really ticked off when people tell the whole story in their review of a book instead of if they liked it or not....I'll just say this: Don't buy it, borrow it....it's not worth it."
3,Pretty Good,"Gothan Diaries was a pretty good read considering it came from celebrity status lawyer and wife (Spike Lee's wife), Tonya Lewis Lee. I mean it didn't knock me off my feet like the awesome novel, COLDEST WINTER EVER. Now that book will have your behind glued to the seat until its finished."
1,Edith Wharton????,"I was excited to read Tanya Lewis Lee's new book, the Gotham Diaries. I was sure it would be intelligent and eye-opening, the ladies were even compared to Edith Wharton on the jacket cover. All I can say is, I was very dissapointed. This book is loaded with cliches and sterotypes. Every white person in the book is stupid and annoying. The men are cheaters, the gay guys are superficial, the women care only about their looks and how they appear socially. The characters are all one-dimensional. Lauren the beautiful second wife of Ed the philandering billionaire, Tandy the aging socialite and Manny the gay guy trying to rise up in the world. These characters are unlikable, except for Lauren. You feel like you don't care what happens to them. Books like these can be a lot of fun, unfortunately the story is boring, the characters are lame, and the writing is extremely poor."
2,Almost interesting,"Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Gucci. Oh my! If I wanted designers I'd go to the mall. I don't need to know who made the office furniture and I don't need to know how Tandy's private parts were held while she was being waxed. I think one big flaw of the book was that the authors assumed that the reader wants extreme details of mundane events. Lee also included gross details that were just TMI- "" his thick black spit"" ""her lip print on the window."" The book just didn't come together visually. Details are great, but save them for when it adds something to the story. I also felt that a lot of the side characters were under developed and were left overexaggerated to make up for their lack. This book is an easy, shallow, and mildly vapid read. Only read it if you're in to that. Otherwise, you can do like me and return it to the sale bin. Honestly, I expected better- as should you."
2,Disaster!,"I read Homecourt Advandtage so I figured oh wow she has another book out. Boy was I disappointed, I don't even know what to say about this book. Except I gave 2 stars 1 for each author."
2,No Atmosphere,"The word ""Gotham"" suggests atmosphere which the book could have used more of in my opinion. Consistently in the book lines like ""the restaurant was fabulous"" or ""the hotel was opulent"" were used. Little attempt was made to transport you, to put you in the room, to truly paint the picture as it were. Atmosphere could have made it more understandable, at a visceral level, why the life is so attractive. Instead, a rational approach was used (i.e. name dropping of expensive cars, clothing, etc) which I found to be sterile, reading almost like a brochure or catalog at times. And one pet peeve: did girlfriend (Lauren) actually order a Green Apple Martini? That's just tacky. Would a billionaire's wife with her background, who has been exposed to so much, order such a thing? Stick with the classics: Cosmopolitans, Gin or Vodka Martinis, Manhattans (and of course Bloody Marys during Sunday brunch)."
3,"GREAT BOOK, BUT MOSTLY BLACK & WHITE","Of the 400 illustrations in this excellent book, only 64 are in color, & most of those are less than a page in size. At least that's true of my 1981 Thames & Hudson used hardback . I was quite disappointed by that when the book arrived, so want to warn other enthusiasts in advance. I've been looking but so far haven't found a possible later edition with more color. Still, I'm glad I own this mostly black and white copy!"
1,DON'T BE FOOLED!,I was fooled. Nowhere in the description of this product does it let you know that the story has been heavily edited from the original. I thought I was buying the unabridged story with the wonderful artwork! I bought this as a Christmas present over a year ago. Imagine my surprise when I was informed that my present was a heavily edited version of the story.
4,Great California road atlas; Highly useful,"The Thomas Guide Calfornia Road Atlas is a great tool if you don't own a GPS navigation system in your vehicle. Very easy to transfer from a highway view to metro view to detailed view of a particular area using the number coded system. The Thomas Guide has highlighted the scenic routes and highways, which is a plus. This road atlas is not overly large in dimension so you can easily open the book just by sitting in your vehicle."
5,Forbes is in a class by himself and Zervos is unforgettable.,"In the past year I have read dozens of audiobooks, but none had the impact of The Heights of Zervos. It begins with a gripping descrition of sabateur hero Ian Macomber narrowly cheating almost certain death, and keeps up the pace in this unabridged story of four men's struggle against huge odds. It's deliciously long, so the pleasure lasts. The writing (and reading) is exceptional (compared with others in the genre) and the characters really live, by their wits, as they carry us to the thrilling conclusion. I must read all the Forbes bookshelf now."
4,great!,This book hardly had any wear or tear. It sure was worth the money I paid for it. :) It was very useful. Especially the poem section.
4,Great guide for parents,"In preparing my son for sixth grade, I needed to have a basis for what he may be learning. This book gives an overall picture of what I need to concentrate on. Many books I found emphasized only math or reading. This book breaks down each topic (Social Studies, Language Arts, Fine Arts, Math, Natural Science) into chapters and makes it easy for me to follow. I liked the exerpts of classic books such as ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", and classic poems so that I can expose my son to many different things without overwhelming him over the summer. This is more of a guide for parents and teachers than it is a simple text for kids so parents really need to be involved."
3,"good source, but only a start if studying for the MSAT","If someone recommended this book to study for the MSAT, maybe they didn't take that test. The book is really easy to understand and gives you a lot of information, but at the time to take the MSAT, I think it is not enough. Get a study aid or two, because that test is very hard. The book is great but for a memory activator and not as the only source."
1,My first disappointment with a vendor,"I could understand if an item was out of stock...as long as I'm informed of that. But my order was for a set of 4 and only one piece was sent...no explanation. When I went back to Amazon to see if I ordered the correct item, the item description said that it was out of stock and availability not known. Customer service at its worst.As far as Amazon goes, I have to give their customer service props for the prompt refund and paid return address label...customer service at its best."
1,Bad Pixel problem,"Great monitor but I ordered one from Amazon, it had a bad pixel. I sent it back and the replacement had a bad pixel, too.Amazon has been good but my opinion of NEC/Mit. has plummeted. Where's the quality control?"
1,It dont work,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DGDKR/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI connect this monitor to my system and turn it on and the display only lasted a few seconds, I turned it off and back on and the same thing happen I tried it several times and the same thing, the display only lasted a few seconds"
3,Vice,"Decent movie, not one of the best but its good anyways. Its up to you if i want to check it if you like but i would not totally recommended this one"
1,PLEASE LISTEN!!!,"I know many may consider this Gazebo Arch because the price seems decent. Let me lend my experience to you...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This item is not only terribly cheap looking it is incredibly cheaply made. When I returned this item to Target the sales associate asked me the reason for the return? I simply and truthfully answered ""It's a hunk of JUNK!!"" FLIMSY/UGLY/WASTE OF MONEY!! Will NEVER last longer than a year, will never hold up to the growth of a vine. TERRIBLE PRODUCT! Should of listened. I would give this product a non-star if I could!!"
3,Arched Gazebo,It definitely takes two people to assemble this structure but once you put it together it is well worth the effort.
2,Just was overpriced and too flimsy of an item...,This item I thought would be great to have in my lawn was not what I expected. A man in town that put one up in my neighbors lawn a year ago told me about how flimsy this is and after the first strong wind it was all twisted and mangled. I didn't even open the box. Just sent it back for a full refund.
1,Be advised!,"Knowing that this was inexpensive in relation to other arches and arbors available on Amazon, I took a chance and purchased this arch as an indoor wedding decoration only. Not only were we unable to use this arch for the wedding, we could not even put it together. This is coming from three college educated people who have put many a pain in the neck item together in their time! Be advised that this item is not worth the inexpensive price by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I can safely say that this was the single most worthless item that I have ever purchased on the internet. This includes Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, Walmart, K-Mart, Home Depot, Sears, Macy's, JC Penney's, and the list goes on and on!!!!!PLEASE don't be tempted to purchase this item based on a few positive reviews. Spend your money wisely and rent from a Rental Center for a wedding decoration or just do without it if it is to be used in a garden. Thank you very much!"
1,This thing is a piece of junk!,"It looks a lot nicer in the picture. It took my husband and I two days to put it together because it's so flimsy, and it's still not right. Green color looks very cheap. I don't expect it to last very long. Not worth the money."
5,Very good for the price,This item is very good for the price; it also looks very nice in the yard. It will not tip over like other reviewers stated if you assemble it right. For the price you can't beat it.
3,Fair price,"This green arbor has a unique shape and three-sided access. It may not be as heavy-duty as other arbors but has held up even in windy conditions. Interesting addition to any garden, and at a reasonable price."
1,Is this price correct,Is this oil really 52 dollars for enough oil to make a one gallon mix. There has to be an error somewhere.
2,Not So Sparkley,"Although the bracelet is embedded with glitter, the resin is a poor quality. It's a bit dull. Mine was very scatched when it arrived, and even has a small chip missing from the edge."
1,"Dumb,Lame,Boring,and Barbie","THIS TOY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My mom got me this for Christmass instead of the Bratz Disco Runway set.It's extremly flimsy and has a drinking theme?!The Bratz drink smoothies from their smoothy bar not alchohal!!!!!!!!!!!This is a poor cheap imatation of the successful Bratz toys. the whole thing is.take itfrom a kid, just cause it's cheaper in price than the Bratz stuff means you get what you pay for!"
4,This toy in no way promotes drinking for 6 year olds,This is the only thing my 5 year old asked for this Christmas and I would highly recommend it for any child that loves to dance and loves music. The person that said this toy was teaching kids about drinking should look a little more closely because the object that resembles a bar is actually a dance floor with a rail. Maybe if parents actually taught their kids about alcohol and drugs they would not rely so heavily on toys to do it for them. Suggestion for Kelsey: Teach your kids that it is ok to go out and party without drinking or doing drugs. Maybe if you try it you'll see that you don't need those things to have a good time. Your comment was exagerated and cruel.
4,My pts love the dance floor and disco light,"This set is fun for older ""Barbie"" fans.It is a wonderful way to open discussions with your kids about teen and adult social settings.I use it with the kids and teens at work as a tool but it would be fun as a toy for older preteens and teens.Many enjoy the dance club idea as well as music."
1,Um....excuse me?,"Um...hi...I'm really not a myscene fan but I feel it's my duty to point this out. My Scene and Barbie are from Mattel, but Bratz are from MGA Entertainment. Just look on the box or the back of a Bratz' head and it'll have imprinted ""MGAE 2001"" or something like that."
1,and people say bratz go to clubs.,"look at this. people say bratz go to clubs and now my scene do. bratz are betta cuz they are innocent girls who just like to do their best at stuff. they go to SCHOOL, they do SPORTS, they go to TOKYO and LONDON. they get lotsa new friends. my scene copied bratz cuz luk at mi chart-barbie- cloemadison- fianna, yasmin, nevrachelsea- meygan, roxxi, phoebenolee- tiana, jadedelancey- yasmin's molejai- sasha"
5,Super Funky Tania !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tania is without a doubt the most funky and jazzy of all the female brazilian divas, and this is perhaps one of her best efforts: Funky Tambourine, Deep Cove View ""Acantilado Profundo"" and Bela Be Bela are absolutely awesome, if your looking for groovy and funky Brazilian Jazz Women, this is perhaps your best choice !!!!!"
5,Great book to have for the beginning homeschooler!,This book gives you valuable information on how to create a low cost curriculum. It has been a wonderful tool through the past 3 years. I keep going back to this book for information! A must have for any beginning home schooling mom!
3,Good intro book or if you have to submit something,"This was a good intro book or if you are required to submit something, but a lot of it seems to be common sense. For exmaple, she talks about figuring our your educational goals and subjects you want to teach your child. If you are required to submit something formally, the questionaires can help to make sure you don't forget something that may be required. I was looking for a book that would explain a specific lesson plan for teaching a specific topic. Some people gave it 5 stars, because they liked the breakdown of education topics, but this can be found on-line at World Book Encylopedia's web site or in the books series ""What your XX grader needs to know"". It is alot more detailed and includes actual lessons. I would give it 5 stars for what it contains, but it was not what I was looking for."
2,Good start not so good ending,"The beginning section of the book is designed to help you define what style of home education fits you & your child. However the rest of the book revolves around a classroom/subject by grade format. So if you end up defining too unique of a homeschool the standard classroom format is of little to no use. This would be an excellent book for families that live in strict states but need to keep things low cost. Check it out at the library, glean what helps and pass on the rest."
5,Great book,I can not put it down! i feel more organised just by having the book in my bag in the first place!
3,pretty good...,ive read like 10 books in this vien. this guide should b considered with other guides. i have yet to read THE GUIDE.
3,"Sturdy, but not perfect","This is a pretty sturdy wheelbarrow for everyday yard work. Smooth running no-flat tire with ball bearings. The parts weren't all bent right out of the box, and it's mild steel that will fail if you have to bend it too many times. Since assembled, I haven't had to re-tighten any bolts or weld any broken parts, so it qualifies as low maintenance. For concrete or brickwork though, I would recommend a solid-poly tub over any steel tub."
3,I agree with some points....,"I was expecting a little more from the book than what was offered. I felt as if I were being told how to feel rather than being comforted with words. Perhaps I mustn't be so senstive. Infertility is not an easy subjet to discuss and hurt feelings are bound to arise. I didn't seek medical help until my husband and I tried for three years. According to this book, that's a huge no-no and I was almost frightened that there might be absolutely no hope since we delayed our trip to the doctor.Try to keep an open mind when reading this book."
2,"If you buy it, but it used.","I don't usually write reviews, but I'm going to for this book because I feel like I completely wasted my money.I think if you're at the point where you're buying books to read about your infertility, you're well paste learning about what's in this book. Everything in the book I was already aware of. I skipped over most of it because I thought it was a waste of my time reading it. There were a few pages that had info that gave me encouragement, but not enough to buy. The people who wrote this book have been a great asset to the infertility community, I just don't think the book is worth reading.Buy Hannah's Hope. It was much better. But if you buy Hannah's hope, don't buy this book because the two books have repetitive info."
2,Not Enough Meat,I was really looking forward to reading this book by Focus on the Family and was rather disappointed with the simplicity of it. There really wasn't much meat to the book and I would recommend purchasing it used.
3,Drums Overload,"Following an acoustic album, ""Bay Of Kings"", see my review, Steve Hackett kept us guessing with this offering. Although not a favourite of mine it does have some high points. Recorded in Brazil, with I believe mostly local musicians, Steve seems to be unsure where this is going and the drums are very much to the forefront, although he clearly intended this. Standout tracks are ""Let Me Count The Ways"", a bluesy number, not really revisited until ""Blues With A Feeling"" some years later. ""The Rio Connection"" and ""Duel"" which chugs along and certainly recalls the Spielberg film which it is dedicated to. Tracks like ""What's My Name"" and ""Myopia"" don't really go anywhere for me, and the closing track ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" the Disney standard is very pleasant, but seems out of place on this album. A bit of a hit and miss affair, but one has to say that the musicianship is excellent as always on a Hackett album."
5,Moved by the spirit in St. Louis,"The CD brings you to your feet, even in your home! The artist obviously worked hard to bring together songs that stir the heart and soul. Definitely a ""must have""."
4,"""On The Train Of Praise""","Fanstastic, The music all good gospel singers, and listerners should rave about, quality? yes, vocal, sound, are all up to part. check this one our for yourselves. it is worth your time."
5,ON THE TRAIN OF PRAISE,".Whoo..I am excited for this great CD, ""On The Train Of Praise"" I could not stop listering to these favorite songs. I had heard them on the radio stations I usually listen too. beleive me I will tell all my friends to make sure, to purchase this one for thier collection. I am really excited to have someone who really cares about sending good quality music."
1,disappointed in the bulb,"It flickers on and off for at least 5 minutes before it stabilizes. It does this every time I turn it on again: I have to wait for a flickering light to decide it's ready to work. It's right out of the box. Otherwise, the design would have been so so great. I am so disappointed as I was really hoping it would have worked. Returning it ASAP."
3,Haven't I seen this somewhere before?,"I love Chris Farley but this movie is not his best. I know this has been said before but to quote ""I liked it the first time I saw it when it was called Tommy Boy"".The name of Farley's character has changed his profession has changed and so has the name of David Spade's. It is still hilariously funny up it will always in my mind be overshadowed by Tommy Boy."

2,A dismal follow-up,"While ""Tommy Boy"" was no masterpiece, it had many funny moments. This film is terrible from start to finish. The writing is bad, the acting is bad; everyone only seems to be there for a paycheck. I get the feeling that Chris Farely was depressed, on drugs, and only doing this for money. There were fat jokes in ""Tommy Boy,"" but here, they're in every scene, and I felt bad for Chris Farley being the butt of the joke again and again. Perhaps a few weight jokes are tolerable, but after the 38th time, it just becomes boring and kind of depressing. Skip this film and watch ""Tommy Boy"" again. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave me a helpful/not helpul feedback."
3,Missed it in the 90's...,I missed this movie when it came out in the 90's. Bought it. Watched it. It wasn't as good as other Farley/Spade movies.
3,Could have been better,"Chris Farley, i'll say is a comedy god, but this movie was not his best work. it could have been a lot better. it's okay, but then again it's not. now Tommy Boy, was a great movie David Spade could not have played both these roles better. Black Sheep was kind of a dissapointment, but if your going to get it, it's your decision, but i think you'll be more happy with Tommy Boy."
1,Talent gone to waste.,"David Spade and Chris Farley are talent gone to waste in this lame movie about an imbecile (Farley) ruining his brother's chances of becoming governer. Although silly and predictable, Black Sheep does have a few funny moments, but no where near enough. It's not completely unbearable, but almost."
3,A Cheap Rip-Off of their Previous Collaboration,"I actually rate this movie with 2.5 stars. It has no purpose. We experienced the magic of the Farley/Spade comedy connection in ""Tommy Boy""; why didn't they just leave well-enough alone? Were these guys in some alternate reality planning to become the next Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis comedy collaboration? Granted, the movie does star Chris Farley and David Spade, so it has its moments (how could it not?). Beyond that, ""Black Sheep"" has no rhyme or reason. Don't waste a minute of your time on this. Chances are, you've already seen it."
1,Definitely not Tommy Boy!,"I guess there is a fine line between stupid funny and just plain stupid. Maybe if I watch this years down the road, I'll think its stupid funny, but right now it was just plain stupid. Tommy Boy wasn't high brow comedy, and I didn't expect that here. I love ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" so I can appreciate stupid antics and grade school humor. This was a remake of Tommy Boy but with the good parts gone. If you are a huge Chris Farley fan, disregard what I say, I am sure you will love it no matter what. If you are looking for a really funny movie and aren't a big Farley fan, then pass and move on to another movie."
5,Classic,"Great Movie ,, you always deliver on time great work and always have the titles that I am looking for,,, thanks again"
5,PLEASE............POP................THE HOOD............,"This movie is almost just as good as Tommy Boy. Every scen has at least one laugh and most have a ton. watch this movie, you will love it!"
4,Don't compair it to Tommy Boy!,"The reason there are so many bad reviews of this movie is because when people heard that Chris Farley (RIP) and David Spade were making another movie together, they were expecting the comic genius that was Tommy Boy. This is not Tommy Boy! You can't expect Chris and David to do the same thing in every movie or it will very soon become routine. Chris's Mike Donelly character is a little less dimwitted than his Tommy Boy character and David's Steve Dobbs character is a little more dimwitted than his Richard character. But, I will say this, Farley and Spade proove once again that they are the best comedy team since the Three Stooges. Sure this movie has it's flaws, but it's worth a look."
4,Laughs through every minute of this movie!,"I was inspired to rent this movie after I had watched the first Farley-Spade movie, Tommy Boy (which is another fantastic show). I found myself laughing throughout the entire movie. This movie never leaves you hanging there bored out of your mind. Although no movie could ever match up to the greatness of Tommy Boy, this movie comes awfully close to achieving greatness. I love this movie and recommend anyone to give it a chance at least once!"
1,mad,Black Sheepi got this movie 3 days ago and when i went to watch it the movie skipped 3 to 4 times while i was watching it. i think that if people are goign to sell their movies they need to watch them and make sure that the movie is in good condition
2,Black Sheep,I believe this film is racist towards the sheep but my friend christian really likes it!!!!
4,"Not quite ""Tommy Boy"" but still funny.","Al Donnelly (Tim Matheson) is trying to get elected governor of the state of Washington, he hires campaign aid Steve Dodds (David Spade) to keep an eye on his brother Mike (Chris Farley) and keep him out of trouble until the election is over. But it isn't going to be easy, until soon they discover something shocking going on about the election from governor canidate Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole) for they need the help of former soldier Drake Sabitch (Gary Busey) to prove that she's a crook.Although no where as great as Farley's ""Tommy Boy"", this is an enjoyable and funny political comedy. You get to see Spade and Farley get into all sorts of funny situations especially Farley getting hurt like the part where he gets his necktie stuck to the back of a driver's car, if you like a good laugh this could be it but don't expect it to be ""Tommy Boy 2"".The DVD is pratically bareboned but the transfer and sound are good."
3,David Letterman before his show was ruined.,"I remember in the mid 80's when David Letterman was just starting out and how simple his show was.Like with stupid pet tricks,Bud Melman ,probably spelled wrong,Chris Elliot,monkey cam and the top 10 list from Sioux City,Iowa.And a lot of other stuff that made his show great.Anyway I do not care much for his newer show now that he is with NBC.Great VHS quality is o.k. but for the price it's worth it."
4,Autobiography isn't all it could be,"I am a bit surprised by the superlatives given this book by other reviewers. SimoneSignoret tells us much about her life in this book,and it is crammed with factual detail. But she does not,it seems to me present a very deep view of her emotional life.Consider a major decision of her life, the leaving of her husband and father of her daughter Yves Allegret for the man,Yves Montand she would spend the rest of her life with. We learn that she fell in love with Montand,but we learn nothing about why .We learn nothing about how this influences her daughter.We do not even learn why she and Montand remained such a strong couple for so many years. We learn much about her childhood years but there is no real analysis of the relationships between her and her parents.For someone who wishes to know much about Signoret's life in a superficial way this is an excellent book. But I do not believe it provides a deep understanding of what her life, and relationships were."
1,"Cool scale, when it works.","This scale has nice features, but only works correctly on an even hard surface. So if you've got carpet or tile where you are going to use it, continue for something else."
3,The Scale is just okay,"I have 20/20 vision and I can not easily see which ""score"" it is giving me. I can see the numbers, but do not know what the numbers represent...."
2,Weight results vary depending on where the scale is situated,"I bought the scale a few years ago and change the batteries so I know it's not a battery issue. My problem with this scale is that the weight results vary depending on where the scale is situated on the floor. If I move it a couple of inches, it will be either up or down a pound. I have weighed myself in one spot and a second later weighed myself in a different spot in the room and the results are completely different. Sometimes by as much as three pounds.I can't rely on this scale at all."
1,Not happy...,"I just bought this unit. When I tell it I am a male, it tells me my body fat percentage is 19.3%. When I tell it I am a male athlete, it tells me my body fat percentage is 9.6%. My conclusion... this thing is completely worthless."
5,Best I've seen.,"Very accurate. Great functions. Brutally honest. Actually looks good. It takes about two weeks to learn all of the functions that the monitor has (although there are days I wish I didn't know). If you are serious about weight and body composition control, this is your machine."
4,not bad,"not bad for the price and capabilities it offers; however, the majority of the computations must be mathematically based and let's face it not everyone is built the same - but still one of the best out there of it's type"
2,Disappointed,Have had this thing for months and overall am not pleased with it. Seems like the technology is just not there yet. Readings for the same person from day to day or hour to hour fluctuate tremendously especially on fat percentages.
5,Great scale with lots of information,I really like this scale. It shows a ton of information and the guides are well written with tips on how to use the scale to get accurate readings. It also contains explinations of all the different readings the scale shows.
1,The Broken Scale,"My order arrived and I could not get the scale to work, calls and emails to Tanita went unanswered. The positive thing was amazon sent an UPS return authorization the very next day I called and a new one should be on the way. Will report then how what I think of the product!"
5,Just incredible,"This scale is the best. So accurate and easy to navigate. Bought for my husband who has a fitness and weight loss business (Physiquetransformation.com) and is very scrutinizing to products like this. It not only passed his test but he actually refers customers to these tanita scales. Most people just see weight on home scales and this scale is unlike others that just show the quanity of your body..this one shows the absolute quality of it....it is worth every penny to those who are serious about weight loss and understanding where one pound may have come from (water, fat, lean muscle, viseral fat, bone density.....)."
2,Tanita BC554 Ironman Glass InnerScan Body Composition Monitor,Body fat inaccurate which in turn would make the rest of the %es inaccurate as well. I returned the item.
4,Ironman scale packs a lot in a stylish package!,"I can't verify the dead on accuracy for anything but the scale function, but you can easily use the other values to reference progress in your diet or physical fitness program. It's easy enough to program, but you will need the manual the first time through. Subsequent use is simple - just touch your ""personal"" button (the scale can track several people), wait for the pound display, and step on the scale. Various things can affect the fat readings, such as putting your hands on your hips, touching something else while it's scanning, and state of hydration. I don't think you should live or die by the numbers, but you can tell if things are getting better or worse over time. Some day I would like to have all the measurements done in a doctor's office and then compare the results with this scale. Would recommend - especially if you're into useful gadgets."
4,Good scale...not happy with Amazon,"The Tanita scale works as advertised. Consistent weight readings, clear readout, easy to operate. If you get this product, use the health features as a relative guage of how you progress...not to establish your initial health condition unless you are Joe Average.Amazon sent me the unit in a timely fashion, but it appeared to be a returned item. There were scuffs on the scale when it arrived... Their price is straight MSRP..."
1,Garbage in Garbae out,"This thing is ridiculous. I have a Homedics scale right next to the the Tanita and the Homedics is always consistent. The Tanita body fat % varies by 20% depending on how warm my feet are, whether I took a shower prior or used the hot tub. Somehow the Homedics is consistent regardless of these factors. Of course I don't have the box and I can't return this useless scale."
2,Not what I was expected...,"I am a little disappointed, because I read so many positive reviews about accuracy n'stuff. The only accurate measure I found was the body weight. The Body Fat and metabolic age varies 10-15% from morning to afternoon check. The Visceral Fat varies 1 to 2 points and the Physique Rating varies 1 to 3 points. It a little hard for some one to digest that in the morning you are 50 years and in the afternoon 42.For a regular weighing kitchen scale is ok, the other measurements are only for fun not accuracy.Therefore, a little overpriced for a kitchen scale.P. S. If anybody thinks I am doing something wrong, I will welcome any pointers to improve the accuracy of my measurements and I will be happy to retract."
4,good,"good product, though i weigh every day and sometimes there is a few pounds differents, and a few percents difference from day to day"
3,The good and the bad...,"Weight-wise, this scale is the most accurate one I've ever had. For all of the other body composition elements, the readings are all over the place and you have to take several factors into consideration. To use the other functions, you really have to take measurements at the same time every day and take an average - understanding the dynamics of hydration, pms, etc., on the readings that the scale gives you. If you have a curious and scientific mind -- WHY am I getting this reading, etc. -- it can be interesting to see how the scale reacts to what's really going on with your body."
1,Died within eight months,"Eight months after spending $130 for the Tanita BC554 Ironman scale, it died. It just says ""error"" on the LCD screen when we attempt to use it.If that wasn't bad enough, when I called Tanita to inquire about a return or repair, they told me that I have to pay for shipping an 10lb scale from California to Illinois. Again, this is AFTER paying over a hundred dollars for one of their products.When I tried contacting The Competitive Edge-the vendor that actually sold the scale, they shrugged and said it's Tanita's problem. That does not make me want to ever order with them again.Unbelievable! I'll never purchase a Tanita product again, or deal with The Competitive Edge."
5,Great machine,"I was so impressed with this scale/scan. The guest option was wonderful since we are using it at work. It also came with sheets to keep track of each individual's progress over time. It is a great benefit to anyone who care about their health and can be used in so many different applications, whether a gym, chiropractor, workplace, etc.... I found the accuracy right on with other methods used. Also it was easy to use and program."
5,It's not all about your weight!!!,"I have always been conscious of my weight but after getting this ""scale"", I am more focused on whether I am hydrated enough and my body fat composition . Both my husband and I highly recommend this ""scale""."
5,Great,"Accurate, easy to use. Very happy with this scale. Lots of bells and whistles. Make sure you need all, if not just purchase a Tanita that has BW, Body Fat %, ,and Body water %."
1,First is not best !,"Everyone reviewed this product in a very positive manner. I purchased this and compared the results vs my Body Fat Test at the Dr Office - and this device was off considerably ! I also purchased a Taylor Branded Body Fat Analyzer that apparently offers the same technology to measure body fat - and it was extremely close to the results that I received from my Dr.I also question the additional ""Innerscan"" body percentages. When I called Tanita Customer Service, they could not justify Bone, Muscle Mass, and Metabolic Age readings and were extremely vague in the interpretation of the features.Even though Tanita was the first to offer Body Fat Monitors...I would say first is not best !"
4,An above average monitor,"I have found this to be a very good monitor. I replaced a Sony 17"" with this Compaq and find that it displays a good crisp picture across the entire viewing area. Corners are in focus and there are ample adjustments on the front of the CRT. I have made adjustments that stay the course. My display has not changed since I made the original setup. I run it at 1024X768, vertical at 85Hz and Horizontal at 68.6k. I don't use the speakers because I have my own sound system. It is not the top of the line but close to it. Four (4) stars."
5,"Fun, hip and modern take on ""The Love Boat.""","I found this book to be a fun, dishy, sexy read - perfect for summer. Based on the other reviews I've scanned here, not sure what other readers were expecting. ""Mutiny on The Bounty"" or ""Titanic"" perhaps? Lighten up, people. When I read the cruise ship concept I figured it would feature vignettes of different characters (like the old TV show) and not just a deep character study of one or two. There's plenty of snappy dialogue that made me laugh and kept me turning pages. And just the right amount of steamy sex. I felt the sway of the ship, smelled the ocean water and was awed by the ethnic majesty and opulence of the ship. Her lush, detailed description swept me way and took me there. Based on the cover's promises, I think this author more than delivered."
4,"Fun read, a great escape","I'm glad I picked this book up. I was so excited when I saw the cover. A black crusie line.. Then, page after page this was a great get away. She made me feel as if I were actually on the ship. Not too much dialouge,but alot of senery. Yes, this writer paints great visual scenes and I felt like I was aboard. One of the main characters, Mia seemed frustrated most times, but she had reasons to be that most of us can probably relate to. It's a looping story and the characters have hidded agendas, which I like. This is my first time reading anything by this writer. If you are looking to relax, then I would recommend this book."
5,Fun Ride!,"This book was a hoot, from the fight scene to the sex scenes (everywhere) on the ship. Good idea. Where's Part 2? I'm going to get my ticket to cruise so I can have a ride of my own."
2,...less storytelling...,"If you've never been on a cruise before, you're definitely in for an awakening when you read The Chocolate Ship. Ms. Monteilh describes everything on this cruise, right down to the crests that were monogrammed on the plates and glasses. In fact, this book was way too descriptive for me - the book itself was over 300 pages with 47 chapters - and maybe only five to six chapters of actual storytelling. The two main characters, Mia and Miles, had a relationship that seemed very strained because of her insecurities, something that continues through the end of the book.You see other relationships in this book formed, broken and reassembled; however, the storyline could have been better had there not been so much description and explanation of everyone and of everything. -JN"
5,All Aboard!!!,"All Aboard the first ever african american owned and operated cruise ship. Mia and Miles, a couple who are on two opposite ends until Miles finally gets it together. Kelly and Scott have jungle fever but Scott is the playa of all playas. Bianca is a single mom who finally finds love on her week long cruise. Will these couples make a love connection? Climb on board The Chocolate Ship and enjoy the week long vacation. I definitely enjoyed this book."
3,Cute,"Starts out very small, but stretches out quickly. Cute shoe though. Not super comfortable, but I can wear them all day."
1,Completely Fabricated,"This is a complete work of fiction. Some of the names and events are real, however the story is a complete fabrication and has little if anything to do with reality. Save your money."
3,Very ......... nice.....,"When I first heard this cd (not having any knowledge of Nick Castro's work) I was quite taken in by the pleasing sounds, the great singing voices, the seemingly eclectic choice of instruments and directions and the unexpected lengthy wordless soundscapes. This, I assumed, is a cd with a modern and interesting take on folk.Unfortunately, listening to it repeatedly only had the effect of lessening its first impact. On the surface there really is nothing wrong with the music, but, alas, it is not very inspiring, daring or even new. It just sounds fine. So pleasing, nice, with hints of the exotic it could be a perfect gift - to anyone. And that, to my mind, is a deadly qualification."
3,"Aurora Plush 12"" Petey puppet",The puppet is very pretty but it arrived dirty. It looked as if it had been stepped on. The beak needed more stuffing but that is easily fixed.
5,Good buy,Got for kids puppet theater. They love it! Highly recommend for smaller to medium hands. It is very durable and colorful.
3,"Reasonable comeback.,..","After almost ten years, Mercyful Fate reunited again, unfortunately without ace drummer Kim Ruzz. As it happens with most of the bands that reunite after such a long time, the ""magic"" or ""chemistry"" is not there anymore. In the case of IN THE SHADOWS, this proved correct. AS it happens with King Diamond's solo outfit, from IN THE SHADOWS onwards the line-up of musicians would never be stable again in the band.Once again, as it happened with his solo outfit, Diamond went away from silly and pointless satanic lyrics and began writing silly and pointless horror lyrics. At least, they do not ""hurt"" s much the ears of the fan, and are not so filled with gore and homage to Satan...The music here is strong and, just believe me, this is the best Mercyful Fate record since they came back."
3,Good material.,"In the Shadows is a good album from Mercyful Fate. The musicianship is tight and skilled, and the songwriting and production are also good. There's a total of ten tracks--one of them is an instrumental (""Room of Golden Air""). The musical direction of this disc is hard rock with a gothic atmosphere. King Diamond does a cool job with the vocals--he's a very distinctive, dramatic, and versatile singer. The guitar work throughout is enjoyable and lively, too. There are some thick and succulent guitar riffs, and the guitar solos are also nice. I find all of the tunes to be listenable and energetic. The ones that I like the most are ""Egypt,"" ""Shadows,"" and ""A Gruesome Time."" ""Egypt"" is a really tight and sprightly tune. Some of the lyrics to the songs are also interesting. The liner notes contain the song lyrics and individual band member photos, too. In the Shadows is worth a listen."
4,The Devil!,"Considering the date I think it's only fitting I review a Mercyful Fate album. I'd always held King Diamond's solo stuff above Mercyful Fate being that I'm a horror fan and love the idea of using heavy metal music to tell spooky stories. I've never been too crazy about Fate lyrically. Musically it's fantastic. The thing is, singing about the devil repeatedly just loses it's punch after awhile. When Diamond ressurected Mercyful Fate and recorded In The Shadows, he must have still had a little of his solo self lingering coz there isn't much satanism to be found. Instead we have some dark occult themes and a few little spooktales as well. The satanic angle would resurface with the next few albums, but the music has never suffered. Excellent stuff, but you already knew that, didn't you?"
3,FATE IS BACK....IN THE SHADOWS!,"One thing that really confuses me with this CD is how very similar it was to what King was doing with his solo stuff at the time...perhaps with the exception of the falsetto stuff being dropped back a notch. But the themes of the songs (demonic fairytales) have never really been what Fate was about. For that reason the album just misses the mark for me...though its still pretty good in places. So what does work for me? Egypt revisited, Shadows (classic) and a Gruesome Time! Great stuff. Thriteen Invitations great musically...but then the subject matter doesn't really hold my attention, as I find with many of the others on this one. So there we go...some you win..some you loose. Any aspiring KD or Fate fan should buy it anyway for the highlights mentioned. Enjoy In the Shadows!"
3,Mercyful Fate - 'In The Shadows' (Metal Blade),"Am I dreaming?Mercyful Fate back together?This reunion effort doesn't just feature one or two original members,try four.Guitarists Hank Sherman and Michael Denner are here as so is bassist Timi Hansen and on drums is new recruit Snowy Shaw.Performing all the vocals on this CD is none other than that diabolical crooner from the 27th level of hell,a favorite of yours and mine King Diamond(still have eerie flashbacks about the time I saw his solo tour umteen years ago).'In The Shadows' isn't half bad,but nonetheless it is HEAVY!!It's almost as intense as the band's 1984's 'Don't Break The Oath' lp.I see the video for the track ""Egypt"" once in a while on Headbanger's Ball.Other decent rockers are ""Shadows"",""Thirteen Invitations"", and the ass-kicking ""Legend Of The Headless Rider"".If you're a fan of the Fate,you shouldn't pass this title up.I'll give it a 3 1/2 star rating."
2,Has Some Okay Moments.,"This album starts off pretty well with the opener ""Egypt,"" but pretty much loses momentum after that song for the most part. The songs aren't that magnetic or attractive. I do admit that the lyrics are quite interesting, especially the ones to ""The Bell Witch."" The different version of ""The Return of the Vampire"" is also okay. Most of In the Shadows is quite forgettable though. As always, the musicianship is better-than-good, it's just that the songwriting doesn't quite hit the mark. King Diamond does well with his vocals as always. I actually rate this album two-and-a-half stars. ""Egypt"" is the best track; it sounds like it could have been on a King Diamond album sound-wise. Mercyful Fate on the whole sounds a little different than the King Diamond material."
3,Its still worth a listen,"yeah ok this isnt as good as ""melissa"" or ""dont break the oath"",but its still a very good cd.i mean yeah if your a hardcore mercyful fate/king diamond fan than u will like this cd. so in general id reccomend you would buy this cd,but if u r choosing to either buy this one or melissa,then definitly go for melissa."
2,Is this music serious,"I feel that I need to have all my predispositions of heavy music temporarily suspended to listen to this seriously. Without being in this state, this CD is just there, a monotone of metal cliche. -enjoy"
4,A must have for any metal fan!,"This was the first I had ever heard any of Mercyful Fate's work. I was very impressed. The guitar solo's all through the album are excellent. King Diamond's voice, as well as those of the band in the background fit in with the beat of the music very well. My favorites on this one are Shadows and Is That You, Melissa. Overall this is an excellent cd. I will most likely be checking out other albums by this band and would recommend other do the same."
1,Shuts off after one year of use..,Same issue here..Continues to shut off after 20-30 seconds of use. Seems to occur more often when trying to watch a DVD. Purchased it at Sears and they no longer have it in stock. I purchased the replacement package from Sears as well... so much for that money being well spent...Our remote worked for about three months with hardly any use at all...What a piece of garbage! Shame on Disney!
1,Broke in less than a year,"We bought this for Christmas for my son in early November. It wasn't until Christmas Day that we realized the DVD player was not working. After exchanging, the new TV worked about 6 months and now it is broken. The DVD player won't work, same problem as the first one. What a mess of a TV. For $150 I expected a lot more."
1,This item Is not worth It,I bought 6 months ago and it's been a hassle it turns off by it self after a couple of minutes and it wont stay on I think this tv was a lot for the quality of the tv I don't recommend it
1,"DTD1363-CAR 13"" TV/DVD Combo should have been recalled","Its a cute TV but thats all it is cute. The DVD stopped working 3 months after buying this. Its not children nor adult friendly. Disney should have recalled this TV. Other people I know that own one, has the same problem, DVD does not work. I was surprised Disney made such a bad quality product, and won't stand behind it. I will no longer buy disney electronics."
4,Great for children!!,I purchased this combo tv for my son's third birthday. He is cars obsessed and LOVES it! It is easy for him to control on his own. The only issue is that the buttons hve a slight delay after you pres the button before the action begins. Not a big deal if you have any patience.I highly reccommend this product
3,TV Seems to work,"The TV seems to work just fine, it does have a strong smell though that kinda bugs me.So far the only problem we have is that my autistic son is really freaked out by the 'eye' screensaver. I wish there was an option to turn the screen saver off or switch it to an automatic shut off."
1,Dissapointing and expensive,"I bought this tv to coordinate with my sons room. It worked for a total of two months when the DVD palyer went on the fritz. In the end the dvd player completly died and i ended up buying a $30 dvd player for my son to watcgh tv on. Thank goodness the screen is still working, but it is not worth the money they want for it."
2,lasted 1 week before problems,This TV was given to my grandson for his 3rd birthday and it stopped reading the dvd's no picture no sound. He loves this gift. His room is in Car's theme..can't find a store that will help in getting it fixed..any suggestions who to contact??
1,Ditto to all the 'shuts itself off' reviews,"Same problem here- had tv for couple years, no problem. A month or so ago, it started shutting off a minute or so after turning it on. When I'd turn it on again, it'd shut off after a few seconds, then wouldn't turn on at all. I'd wait a few hours, try again, same result. I can't even remove a dvd inside, because tv won't stay on long enough for me to eject it, haha! Finally decided to replace it, since the cost of repairing such a small tv makes no sense. What a waste though- it is a cute tv. Anyone know a way to gut it and make a display shelf out of it? HAHA!"
1,The price,"I have seen this TV sold in Walmart, Toys R'Us, and the Disney online store. As adorable as it looks, all of the reviews I have read have been the same---the TV cuts off. Therefore I will not be purchasing it. However, I'm just curious about the price listed here on Amazon for over $400. I've seen it for less than half everywhere else. I'm really surprised about the price here!"
1,DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!,"I bought this tv for my son at Christmas and now all of a sudden it is shutting off all by itself. (i guess just like all the other reviews on here!!) I am VERY disappointed in this product and my son is very upset about his cars tv. Just called about it, the manufacturer went out of business. BIG SURPRISE!! I should have just flushed the $150.00 i spent on this tv down the toilet instead!!!!! Thank you very much Disney, you should be very ashamed of yourself!!!!!"
3,Fixed my power off problem,"I found that mine had a cold solder (dry joint) on the Horizontal Output Transformer.DANGER: High voltages are involved so leave the TV disconnected for several days before attempting this fix. Do not attempt without knowing what you are doing and taking the proper precautions.The HOT is a black transformer with a thick red wire coming out the top. Remove the circuit board from the TV, and look at the transformers pins underneath. Get a soldering iron and some fresh solder, and resolder those pins (add fresh solder to each joint with the soldering iron). Reassemble and test.Mine fired up great :)"
1,"TV emanates burning smell, working problems",My son received this t.v. as a Christmas present. We have currently contacted the manufacturer as the t.v. has started to give off a strong burning plastic smell. It has given my son headaches. We also had some problems with the functionality of the t.v. Would not recommend.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!,"We bought this TV for our son last Christmas and haven't used it until about a month ago. Everything was going fine until last week when it started shutting off by itself after being on for only 20 seconds. I thought maybe it was something wrong with the wire that plugs into the wall. After unplugging it and plugging it back in, the TV would come on for a few seconds and then shut off again. I was planning on taking it to a repair center only to find out that they will not repair Disney TV's and that I would have to go through Disney to get it repaired.Only after reading the other reviews have I since learned there is only a 90 day warranty which has expired, that it will cost $85 for Disney to fix it plus shipping, and that it has been happening to tons of other people. This TV should be recalled and I do not see how they can get away with ripping people off like this."
1,Disappointed!!!!,"I bought this tv for my son for Christmas. After only a few hours of use the DVD would not eject. Tried manually taking it out and there doesnt' appear to be any way of manually removing the DVD. Wish I had read some of the reviews here prior to purchasing this piece of garbage. Now my son is disappointed because I'll have to find another tv. All the other features seem to work ok but also isn't very ""kid"" friendly on the remote or tv functions. For instance to play a DVD you have to go to the input screen and press through the scroll to get to DVD. At least it happened early enough to take it back to get a refund. Still, my son is sad because his cars tv will have to go back.P.S. There is a technical support number which wasn't much help because all you can do is try to leave a message but ironically the mailbox was FULL!"
1,Not intended for long-term use,"I purchased this item for my son less than one year ago. Within three months from the date of purchase (almost exactly to the day the warranty ran out) the DVD began skipping and not playing DVDs. I had to buy a separate DVD player and hook it up to the AV jack in the back of the TV so my son could watch movies.So far the screen still works but it already has a greenish color beginning to cloud part of the left side of the screen.My son is very upset that his favorite TV is no longer working correctly. This year I will buy him another TV/DVD combo but it will not be this model.I recommend that you read all of these reviews before you decide to purchase this item, I wish I had done that. I learned a tough lesson the hard way, I didn't do the research."
1,I do NOT recommend this TV,We bought this TV less than one year ago and my son cannot even use it. It keeps turning off by itself. What a waste of $150.
1,Don't Buy this TV,I bought this TV for my son and it is only 7 months old and the DVD player doesn't read the disc anymore.. Not worth the money and even the TV places that I called to repair said it is probably the laser and it would cost about $150.00 to repiar it.
1,keeps turning off,"My son recieved this for his 2nd Christmas. He loves this TV, but the DVD player boke after 1 year. It kept spinning and then the TV started turning itsself off after 45 seconds. I am so upset with Disney. Repair shops won't repair it and I am very upset."
1,Don't be taken in by it's cute appearance,"What a disappointment. My nephews loved this TV when we bought it for them last Chirstmas. Like all the others the TV will play for a minute or so and just shut off, will not turn back on until some time has passed. Avoid the temptation and buy a small LCD flat panel with built in DVD for less."
1,Do Not Buy This TV.....,"I bought this Tv on 3/7/07 for my sons 3rd birthday his whole room is done in the cars, now almost exactly one year to the date it has started turning off on its own, my son now doesn't want to sleep in his own room because he thinks someone is in there turning off his tv. He can't understand this is just a piece of junk tv. And after spending so much money on this room and tv and trips to Disney you would think they would stand behind there product."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,"This TV / DVD Combo is an absolute piece of junk. I, too, have had the same problems as the other reviewers. Within 6 months the DVD player started not reading the DVD any more. I could hear it spinning in the DVD player, but nothing would show up on the screen. So we bought an external DVD player and hooked it up to the television. We thought things were going great until the TV started turning off by itself after just a few seconds.Also, my child's best friend has this same TV / DVD combo a couple of weeks after us and they are having the same problems."
1,worst them garbage,Got it for my kids for Chirstmas open it up plug it in turn it on stays on for 1-2 secs then turns off. That all it will do!!!!When I say worst then garbage I mean some garbage has a value!!
1,Too fragile for Amazon free shipping,"I'm giving the item one star only for the state this item arrives in.I ordered this casserole with high hopes. Unfortunately, it turned out that Amazon shipping is not designed for this kind of product - casserole arrived smashed in pieces, although box seemed untouched. Thanks to Customer Support advice I didn't have to ship it back (trust me, nothing to look at - but I did leave feedback for package on the site and attached photos). Next, I ordered a replacement, and no surprise there either: same type of package, and item arrived in a form of dozen shards again. Package is of unsufficient size and protection, no ""FRAGILE"" labels on box. No mystery there, product gets ruined while in transit... It is very unfortunate that probably decent product goes to trash. I'm hoping Amazon customer support would advise me not to ship the second one back - otherwise the company would spend even more money for return shipping."
2,Raskin tries too hard to be critical of Abbie,"I wonder if Raskin would ever be so hypercritical of just about every statement she has ever made, the way she is of Abbie. The book was interesting at first, but I feel she went way overboard in disecting everything Abbie said and how ""factual"" it really was. After a while it seemed like one big critique of everything Abbie said. Like she set out to prove he lied about everything. ""Well, he said this and I went back and interviewed five different people who said it actually happened like this."" To me a biography should be about how someone lived, not a dissection of everything they said. She really turned a fascinating story about a very creative and excitng person into almost a police report - ""just the facts, mam.""This book really bugged me!"
2,readers digest version of quantum mechanics,This book is not worth buying. Dyson gives us conclusions without showing metodology. It is virtually impossible to use.
5,Christmas Gift,This was also a Christmas Gift for my nieces 5 year old... Besides WKRP shes a very big fan of Walker Texas Ranger.... Big Chuck Norris fan... I just hope she don't give me one of them kicks... lol.. She loved it....
5,Must-have beginning for a great series,"Walker Texas Ranger: The Complete First SeasonGet the first season and enjoy this action packed series from the beginning! Chuck Norris as Walker, Texas Ranger uses his kickboxing to thrill the audience and subdue criminals in Texas. I especially enjoy watching the development of the characters in this first season."
1,Alienated,"There are no closed captions or subtitles on these discs. Those who can't hear have a fondness for the martial arts on TV and in the movies and we all love Chuck Norris. We, therefore, are left to catch episodes of ""Walker"" on the USA and Hallmark channels with their long, drawn out, BORING commercials. Tapes and DVDs from TV shows are never closed captioned. A little consideration for the deaf would have been greatly appreciated."
2,More Teen / Adult Level Material,I was surprised at the language and story lines in the first season. Not what I expected and not what I wanted my 10 year old to watch. However that being said the few shows I watched were solid Chuck Norris. I only rated it low to bring attention to the PG rating not displayed in the ad.

4,An interesting look into WWI from a soldier's view,"This was an interesting look into WWI from the point of view of a soldier. Teddy Roosevelt's son kept a great record of his adventures through the middle east, France and Germany as he fought in WWI. His writing style is very matter of fact, and his descriptions of the surroundings are sometimes very clear and other times very vague. It really reads more like a personal journal than a war story, and he leaves out a great deal about the fighting itself. He tends to sum it up very matter of factly by stating how bad the fighting was on a particular day and nothing else. He goes into great detail about the people he meets (including Colonel Lawrence of Lawrence of Arabia fame, for example) It's not terribly well written but it's certainly not boring. It's very interesting, and a great buy for anyone who wonders what it was like to be on the ground during the Great War."
4,An Underrated Work,"When I first read of The Stone Flower it was described as an ""abstract"" ballet. Although its plotline is a little odd, it is in the tradition of Russian national romanticism, and though it is not innovative like Prokofiev's earlier work it is still pleasing enough to listen to. The ballet's emotional theme is a bit sentimental, but overall I believe that Prokofiev's last work has been underrated. The ""Swan"" melody from Ivan the Terrible has been well-altered for this work, and the bits from ""Summer Day"" also fit well into the ensemble. There are arresting original themes, too, such as that of the Mistress of Copper Mountain, the Dance of the Russian Jewels, and the Ural Rhapsody. The ballet's music does get repetitive near the end, so though it is not Prokofiev's best work it is still a fine piece."
2,False premises,"The main problem with this book is that it rests on the author's quirky insistence that Atlantis sank in 1200 BC. This does not agree with Edgar Cayce or Plato, or any of the scholars that have devoted years of study to uncovering historical information about Atlantis.Joseph follows Plato's guidance and places Atlantis in the vicinity of the Atlantic Ridge, but there is no evidence that a large portion of the Atlantic Ridge was above the surface after 10,000 B.C. and a great deal of proof that some of it was above the surface before that time.He ignores the Cayce Readings that distinctly name dates and changes some of the Readings to reflect his ideas. One must ignore most of what Joseph has written, based as it is on false premise.For a careful compilation of information from Edgar Cayce, scholars and scientists about the land and people of Atlantis, I suggest ""Atlantis: Insights From a Lost Civilization."""
4,Useful resource for journalist,A compact and concise guide for working journalist and journalism students. The real-life examples are particularly useful. A handy guide for any newsroom.
5,"Details, and Details about how to write well.","I barely received my copy, and theadvice/help on being a better writeris pretty good. One thing that standsout in the book is the issue of vulgarity,and that is simply a no when it comesto writing journalism. The other areasare well explained, and i tell any onewho is reading this small paragraph, get it,it is worth it! It will definitely help youget more creative with your writing, this islike the bloom's taxonomy of writing."
1,Needs a Re-write!,"I couldn't believe my eyes! Wouldn't you expect this writing guide to be grammatically correct, at the very least? It isn't. Something else it isn't is quickly accessible. You have to read through the sarcasm, and then see a ""corrected"" version of a poorly written example. Unfortunately, that version needs work, too. Usually, I keep every book I buy, or give them to friends or charities, but this one went into the trash. Yikes!"
5,Excellent for PR and marketing journeymen,"As the owner of a 17 year old PR and marketing firm, I always look for ways to improve the knowledge of my associate staff writers. This book is an excellent guide to usage in writing ""newsy"" articles, short news bits, and even public relations releases (press releases). With the explosion of content on the Internet, this kind of guide has become invaluable to any content editor who needs to provide clear, concise editorial material for on-line readers of any industry or niche. Highly recommended! (Just ordered a second copy!)."
4,Good Resource,"As a college journalism minor, I found a lot of information in this book.When the author makes the case for using ""said"" to attribute quotes, it does make writing the quotes into the story much easier. However, I don't like using the same word over and over again, but that's a personal thing. I do like how it makes it easier to decide how to give credit for a quote though, less guess work on the part of the writer.The ""Mixed Metaphor"" section of the book was great for evaluating my personal writing.The examples in the book are pretty good articles. I really liked ""Churubusco's All Round Nice Guy"". I read the story and thought that it was a little reminiscent of Anna Quindlan's style of writing, especially in her piece ""Homeless"".Had I not needed this book for my journalism class, I most likely would not have bought it. However, I think that it is a good resource for those who write."
4,No Trailers,I was strolling through my local electronics store on the 9th and was able to grab a copy of this special editon DVD. I was shocked to learn later at Amazon that it had been recalled.The DVD packaging does mention the inclusion of trailers on the 2nd disc but in reality they are not on the disc. That seems to be the only fault I can find thus far.I have enjoyed watching the deleted scenes on disk 2.I hope for all the other fans that the DVD is back on store shelves very soon.
4,A worthy big screen debut for the Next Generation crew,"With Star Trek VI sending off the entire classic Trek crew, Star Trek Generations is the big screen debut of the Next Generation crew and also gives fans something most have always wanted to see: the crossover between both eras. Although the storyline is hokey, it has elements of the original series, and seeing Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) in the same frame together is more than worth watching this film for alone. The special effects are great as well, including the sequence where the Next Generation-era Enterprise crash lands on a planet's surface, and the presence of Whoppi Goldberg and Malcolm McDowell in pivotal roles add to the film. All in all, Star Trek Generations is a nice big screen debut for the Next Gen crew, and would pave the way for the best film to feature the crew with Star Trek: First Contact."
3,What happened to the extra scenes?????,"Wasnt Captain Kirk supposed to be skydiving in this film?? and he told Scotty (Doohan) and Checkov (Koenig) that he didNOTwant to go aboard the the new enterprise?? Why is it that when Picard beams down to Veridan III, his comm badge is on and when he finally gets to the surface his comm badge is not there? When he is in the ""Nexus"" its on Leonard Nimoy shouldve been in this movie! I was born in the same city as Captain Kirk Montrea'l Canada and we also attended the same college Mcgill University in Montreal; I know this because I was on the same airplane as William Shatner and he told me honestly, Leonard Nimoy and fellow actor Deforest Kelly wouldve done a hell of a job better than Jimmy Doohan and Walter Koenig. So I guess I heard it from the expert himself; William Shatner aka Captain James T Kirk for all who didnt know"
3,A Fair Star Trek movie.,"Who came up with the idea of having Kirk die twice? It's ridiculous. Kirk is awesome and doesn't deserve to die. He's a whole lot better than Picard. Come on, Kirk needs to be in every Star Trek movie. This was the only flaw in the plot. Malcolm McDowell is a great actor and he did a good job in the movie, but you just can't beat Kirk. He started the whole Star Trek thing. And now, here comes Picard? I liked Picard in the TV series and I liked the fact he and Kirk worked together in the movie, but the first six Star Trek movies have been all about Kirk. Where's the love, man?"
2,The Trek Films run out of Gas.,"Actually I was so unimpressed with this movie when it was in theaters. It's weak plot (Madman wants to kill millions so that he can jump into heaven) yeah I'm sure there was a point to that, but it's lost on me. Generations relies more on the special effects and less on the plot, a trademark of the Next Generation series I'm afraid, and considering how bad the Trek films have been since then, it can all be traced to this dismal movie."
5,The Old meet the New!,The first motion picture for the Next Generation crew and Captain Jean-Luc Picard sits comfortably as Star Trek's new leading character.......even if he gets a bit of help from the legendary Captain James T Kirk! Generations includes 2 very important events in the Star Trek timeline which makes this a must see.....and a must have!
3,Fails To Interest.,This movie fails to interest. The movie was not horrible but the movie took to long to get to certain interesting parts. The Nexus was interesting but they didn't involve that enough and the end of the movie was interesting but you have to go through most of the movie to get to that part and by that time your either bored or you just shut the movie off and miss the best part of the movie. I have a split decision on this one so I do recommend this movie Slightly.
3,Umm ...,"That's what I was left thinking upon watching this movie again recently. It had a decent plot, a relatively good performance from Stewart (Picard) and Franks (Riker), however, what left a sour taste in my mouth was Spiner (Data) and Sirtis (Troi). The less-than-entertaining slapstick and over-emphasized emotions did more to detract from the plot and aggravate frequent TNG viewers than any positive effect that they may have created. Over all, it was a less than stellar - pardon the pun - way for The Next Generation to arrive on the big screen ..."
4,"A good movie, but plot needed work.","It is not the best of the Star Trek movies. The plot was weak in spots and did drag a bit. There are just too many ""why didn't they just do this"" moments in the plot. Many people felt that the script was a rush job by Paramount in an effort to get a new Trek movie out in the wake of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's death. The concept of a hand-off movie of classic Trek to Next Generation was a nice idea, but not executed well enough. Despite this, if you just sit back and watch it as a fun movie, it does a great job and is very enjoyable to watch. Just don't over-analyze it and you will enjoy it greatly."
4,Wait For The Special Edition,Die Hard Trekkies are already collecting the Special Editions that Paramount has been dripping out (aka they're sure taking their time with this franchise). If your new to Star Trek wait for these 'special editions'. (Movies 1-6 are now available).Even the 'crippled' 5th movie was better with a re-edit. And of course the extra's speak for themselves.
2,My Least Favorite Star Trek Movie,"First, let me give the pluses. This movie was a bridge between the Star Trek casts. It also hit science fiction at its best with the Nexus utopia, shown to be pleasant but not the best. Malcolm McDowell was a good villain, though not at Alex DeLarge (A Clockwork Orange) proportions.The strength of each of the Star Trek incarnations is a great ensemble. There is some heirarchy, but you still have a team feeling. This movie does not develop either the original or the Next Generation ensembles. The focus is only on three characters: Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who took the mentor role in this story. There are only short appearances from the original cast, and only enough interaction of the Next Generation cast to show they're there.There were other ways one could have bridged the gap that could have been better and more satisfying."
1,Lame & Pointless,"Basically a re-make of The Final Frontier (#5;1989) but with the NG crew rather than the original series crew. Should any reader of this review come across this movie again, notice the likenesses: The Nexus versus the Great Barrier, and Soran the Madman versus Sybok the Madman. As for ""uniting"" the two ENTERPRISE crews, it of course failed because Spock and some others declined to take part. Moreover, the first crew gave its farewell in The Undiscovered Country and the Enterprise-D crew would fare just fine on its own in First Contact (with the sleeker if smaller Enterprise-E). Also, McCoy, Spock, and Scott (who for some reason did not sit out that token cameo role) already made appearances in one television series episode (Encounter at Farpoint I, Unification II, Relics). Therefore, why bother?"
4,LOST IN THE ALPHA QUADRENT,"TO THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER. I PURCHASED THE S.C.E. OF GENERATIONS WHICH LISTED THE TRAILERS BUT COULD NOT FIND THEM ON EITHER DISK HOW DID YOU FIND THEM? I V'E TRIED WRITING PARAMOUNT ABOUT THIS,BUT THEY WILL NOT RESPOND. I THINK GENERATIONS HAD THE BEST TRAILERS OF ALL THE STAR TREK MOVIES AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THEM!"
4,a true fan would buy this :),if you like the next generation you'll want to own this. Very cool way to see the crew extend the stories past the season 7 eppisode.
2,A Trek too far,"It always seems in these Berman-era Trek's,two things seem to always draw viewers.Time Travel & The Classic series.The latter was a plot point in First Contact,but Generations melded the classic crew and the Next Generation.The historical meeting of Captains Kirk & Picard is what Trekkers long for.The result is a convuluted extended TV episode,a very irksome Data,an impressive yet unnessesary destruction of Enterprise D ,and a very shoddy death of our beloved Capt Kirk.At first I liked it ,but thought it could've been better(Hey it's a start).As time went on it hasn't worn well,feeling more & more like it was made to manipulate fan expectation.No Berman era film has yet captured the big screen experience like the classic Trek films.Even bringing the Classic cast couldn't save Generations from its own mediocrity."
3,Average Trek,"This film is O.K.It marks William Shatners' last appearance as Capt.James Tiberious Kirk.While its kind of slow moving,there are some great one liners such as Data saying ""Oh,s___t!!""and the scene in Ten Foreward.Malcom McDowel is great as Dr.Soran.The special effects are first rate as usual.All in all,a decent entry in the Star Trek movie list."
2,"Paramount,what about some extras!",This DVD hasn't even got the trailer of the film! A disgracefully poor DVD effort by Paramount.
3,Where to start!,"Well. It sounds, looks and plays like an extended TV episode. Which is a damn shame, because the idea is reasonable, no-one acts badly (more than usual) and the effects are a must. But something, somewhere does not gel.Perhaps what is needed is to look at the whole Star Trek NG thing from another angle. Star Trek First Contact goes some way (at least at the start). But this is lost by Insurrection.Having said that. Down with wiggy, Long live Baldy!!!"
1,"Maybe not the worst, but close","It may not be the worst Star Trek movie, but it's pretty bad. A lot of pointless plot elements (remind me again why Riker seperated the ship?) Bad special effects (the crass landing.) Don't bother wasting your money on this DVD, instead invest in First Contact or Star Trek 6."
1,This movie blew chunks.,"I'd like to point out first that I like Star Trek films, but this particular one (the first for the Next Generation) is horrible. With Malcolm McDowell as the lead villain, I expected much more. But instead he is depicted as a crazed scientist with an addiction to return to a portal which only reaches availability on rare occassions.Speaking of that portal, what a joke. The whole movie is set up around it but it really isn't even something that looks to belong in the film. And trying to merge former Star Trek cast members with current ones sounds good on paper, but I believe Shatner's ego tried to steal the show on this one .... and it didn't look good.Perhaps the most unforgiving detail here is the explosion of the Klingon ship, it's the EXACT SAME SCENE from the previous Star Trek movie! No new special effects, let's just borrow from the last film?On a lighter note, at least they destroyed that ugly looking Enterprise finally."
3,Best TNG Movie,"Even though this is the best TNG movie, that isn't saying much. When Kirk left the Nexus, he should have gone to the Enterprise-B the moment he left the ship and kill Zoran. But nope, the legendary Kirk is killed off in a lame death scene. However, this movie does make you think about several key concepts. Because this TNG movie actually made me think, I give it 3 stars."
4,Reason for delayed release,"Paramount was set to release it on September 7, but due to a printing error on the covers, pulled all the copies off the shelves to print new labels.The error had to deal with the fact that the trailers were NOT going to be on the DVD but the labels said they did.Rumor has it that not all DVD's were returned to Paramount and a few copies were sold to the general public with the first set of labels. I'm guessing you'll see these sold on eBay for lots of $$$ because of the error in printing."
4,Very Good Sound and special effects,Paramount does the best job of re-mixing the sound on their DVDs. I love the intro and the 1st Captain Kirk death scene. One of my all time favorites.
3,Check out the comic book version of this movie...,"...there's a few alternative scenes in there. This is because the writers of the comic were given an earlier version of the script, and some scenes were later changed near the release date of the movie, when they'd already started scripting/drawing the comic.For instance, it features an alternative opening sequense to the ""spinning champange bottle"", I'm not going to tell you the details, but the scene involves Kirk and Scotty..."
2,Disappointed!,"I'm a liitle disappointed with Paramount with their release of the Star Trek films on DVD. This one has been the worst so far, with 6 more on the way. They tried to use a light filter to brighten up the movie, problem is that they left it on during the whole thing. In the scene right before ""Stellar Cartography"", where the Enterprise does a fly-by, you can actually see a box around the Enterprise. This a problem only seen in Star Wars movies...before the Special Editions. My second complaint is that they chintz on the extras. No interviews, no outtakes, no multiple camera views, no NOTHING! Let's send a message to Paramount that we WANT THE EXTRAS!"
2,Why?,"Why indeed. Being the huge Trekkie I am, I still wonder why they had to kill Kirk. I know that he probably wouldn't be in any more movies, but still, you don't have to kill him. Also, this movie is boring, boring, and boring. It's like an extended episode. Not in my list of the best Trek adventures. Stick with the first 6 movies instead"
2,Mediocre Star Trek Movie,This is not one of the better Star Trek movies. It's about as good as one of the so-so TV episodes. But I expect more from a full length film.
3,"A good Trek Movie, but not a great one.","It seemed the only purpose the writers had for this movie was to pass the batone to the Next Generation cast. It was entertaining but lacked the depth and emotion of the Khan film (the best ST movie yet). My favorite part is the Enterprise crashing on the planet. If your a fan you'll enjoy this very much. If it's your first ST movie, buy Wrath of Khan."
3,Commentary redeems it,"Star Trek: Generations is a lackluster movie, a disappointing passing-of-the-torch from the Orginal Series crew to the Next Generation. The merits and flaws of the film are widely known, so I don't need to detail them here.What makes this collectors' edition worth the time is the self-deprecating commentary track by writers Ron Moore and Brannon Braga. It turns out they are well aware of the weak points of their script and are willing to discuss them quite candidly. They look at the movie with the benefit of hindsight and offer ideas that would have made it a much better outing.It is too bad they didn't write the movie they now talk about wanting. It could have been spectacular. As it is, this package provides a so-so movie and a first-rate collection of extras."
4,It was Ok...,"I thought this movie was too much for an audience who doesn't know a lot about the characters and their background. Like, most people wouldn't know who Picards brother is, or how close a friendship Picard and Guinan had. The real messed-up part was that in ST:5, Kirk says ""I've always known I'll die alone"" but they couldn't even live up to that in the movie, he died next to Picard. Altogether it was a great movie with Lore's emotion chip in Data and what goes on when he has it."
3,Not at the top or at the bottom,"Let's just say that there has been better. I've been a big fan of Star Trek for a long time and I can't honestly say that this was a great way to stage the TOS to TNG transition in the film genre... it's not bad but there are plot problems throughout... A good movie for the die-hard fan but not something for those first wandering into the series. Trekkies will enjoy it, but that's about it."
2,"Tragic, truly the black sheep of Star Trek","This movie is horrible. I've seen every episode of all the series, and own the movie collection on DVD, and I have to say this is the worst thing I've seen. First off, the biggest problem is Kirk. After everything he's survived, after saving earth so many times, he dies by falling forty feet. Not too mention the storyline has pathetically cheesy, and everything was exactly like the tv show. The Enterprise D did need to be gotten rid of, due to it didn't translate well onto the big screen. But the way they destroyed her was sad.They also screwed around too much with data's emotion chip. The idea of data using his tricorder as a puppet is outragous.True trekkies should watch, but doubters and casual watchers skip on to First Contact."
2,Huh?,"This has got to be the worst Star Trek film ever made. The plot was ludicrous, some madman is bent on killing thousands of innocent people so he can have a good afternoon. The entire treatment of the classic Trek character's is shameful, this sorry excuse of a film is a prime example of how much the producer's don't care about the film's integrity, mabey this is why Trekker's have started the ""Bring Kirk Back,"" and Excelsior campaigns. Don't watch this movie, just skip it and go straight to First Contact."
2,And I might be being generous,"This is the first Star Trek movie where the people of the Next Generation are featured. Also a few of the original characters are involved. That is where it starts going downhill. We are introduced to the substance tri-lithium, which can kill suns. Data at last gets human emotions, and the two Captains get to work side by side.However, they turn the 1701-D into a weakling of a ship, by having it taken out by a single strike(not even a salvo, really) from an obsolete, delapidated klingon bird-of-prey/scout-class wessel (as Mr. Chekov would have called it)that was flawed while it was in service. I realize they wanted a knew set, but she should have died harder. And Admiral Kirk's death was not enough to do him justice. This was supposed to be a transitional movie, but the first generation, while not really going out with a whimper, certainly did not go out with a bang. It was more like a groan."
2,Shame,"Next Generation was supposed to replace the original cast who were getting older, fair enough. The Undiscovered Country did this transition brilliantly. What Rick Berman hoped to accomplish with this depressing, no story, do nothing film, other than try to put a final nail in the coffin of the original cast I don't know. Here are the spoilers. First, Picard gets word that his brother and nephew are killed in a fire, sad. Then the Enterprise gets distroyed by the Klingon Cleavage sisters, depressing. Then to top off everything, they find Capt Kirk, bring him to the future, and kill him. But not a hero's death on the bridge of his ship, going out in a blaze of glory, nooooo. He falls off of a rock. Outragious!I'm done venting. ..."
3,"Don't own it, Rent it...","As a feature film... I won't lie to you. William Shatner did a better job in Star Trek V: The Final Spoof (aka the Final Frontier.) I didn't like the score, Kirk's death, Picard's storyline, or Data's jokes. I forcefully tried to accept this movie, on the grounds that I get to see the Enterprise-B, Kirk and Picard working together, and Malcolm McDowell doing his best as a semi-good enemy. The more I try, the more it doesn't work.The DVD may make everything look better. But that is as fas as it goes. No trailers, no behind the scenes. The only reason it is three star worthy is because I can watch it, and make fun of it, in other languages.Bottom line - Rent it to see it. Keep it to complete the collection. Own it... at your own risk."
1,Poor quality conversion,"Rather than comment on the plot or story as did most everyone else, let me simply say that the conversion of this film to DVD is about as poor as I've seen. I have this film on VHS as well. The compression artifacts jump out, especially in the scenes on the planet between Patrick Stewart and Malcom McDowell. The image breaks down very badly and is very distracting. It's a shame, and a bit of a mystery since the First Contact DVD is exceptionally sharp and well done. Go figure."
2,Don't waste your time or money!,The plot was decent but poorly implemented. Data really got on my nerves and it distracted from the picture. Kirk was great (as usual); Pickard was also good. Gene Roddenberry would've been extremely disappointed in the drawn-out development of the story. I was falling asleep after the first 1/2 hour. I've seen all the Trek movies and this one is definitely THE PITS!!!
2,Dull and maybe even a bit pretentious,"This ""passing of the torch"" from the Kirk generation to the Picard generation simply falls flat as a movie experience.It's full of plot contrivances and an insane amount of technobabble (which even the commentary admits), while holding very little dramatic punch. And (again, as the commentary admits) the scenes where Picard and Kirk are together are simply not what they should have been.Although this is not the worst Star Trek film, it's still a pretty boring movie. There are plenty of examples in this film of the kind of material that gives Star Trek a bad name. I would give an anti-recommendation to non-Trek fans (lest they think Star Trek is always like this). In fact, I can't imagine anyone but the most hardcore Trekkies even enjoying this one, despite the one or two good scenes or lines in it."
1,STAR TREK at its worst,"This movie makes absolutely no sense within the rest of the Star Trek universe.Time after time this script forgets the history of 300+ shows and movies. The big meeting of Kirk and Picard is meaningless (after all the hype) because both have spent the whole movie completely out of character. Before making the movie I would have asked these questions:1. Why does Picard do nothing but have a pity party and feel sorry for himself?2. What does smashing the Enterprise-D add to the movie?3. If Kirk gets to spend eternity with any women he wants why did the writers pick who they did?4. Is Kirk's help (when he meets with Picard) REALLY needed? Is what he does what this legendary Captain is all about?Buy ""First Contact"" instead."
4,Beware of injuries!,"I agree with several viewers that some of these excercises move way too fast for proper form-I really love the dvd but with the Power Punches when he does the punches really fast,its easy to throw out your shoulder or back-I found that out the hard way with a herniated disc in my neck.I really do enjoy the workouts though-it is my go to dvd on the days when I just ca'nt get motivated-Billys energy just gets me moving.I still plan to use this dvd-just not speed up the excercises like he does"
4,Love it,"I gave this four stars because there is nothing in stretching, but if you want to mix it and really sweat this is a great DVD. Billy is so encouraging and I love the fact that he doesn't scream at you. Just think, this guy is in his 50's and is living proof his method works. He does the talk and the walk."
2,Waste of time and money,I have been a avid follower of Billy Blanks since his first DVD and this one was not worth the time or money since there is no warm up and breaking up to 10 minute segments doesn't work! Too busy with playing with the remote control to get into a flow.
1,Work It,Billy Blanks says work it to many times in the workout. That's annoying and they are out of order. I can't do the workout cause he saying work it so much.
4,"Great Workouts, but They Are Ouf of Order","I have several Tae Bo workouts and Tae Bo Express is one of the better ones. There are 8 different 10-minute workouts. Just because it is only ten minutes doesn't mean the workouts are easy. I was sweating before a full ten minutes was up. The only downside to the DVD is that there is no ""play all"" button and the workouts are listed out of order.The correct order should be:1. Fast Footwork2. Punch & Kick3. Power Punch4. Kick Express5. Boot Camp Power6. Combo Express7. Tae Bo Abs8. Isolation Toning"
5,Best first read,I remember this book as my first real read. I remember reading and loving the moral of the story. Since then it has left a lasting impression on me. I cannot rememeber who gave this book to me but I know it was the best first book I had at 6 yrs old. Now I found it I plan to read it to my 4 yr old. When I got to school my reading skills florished. I recommend it to any small child.
3,Seemed like a good idea,Bought this a couple years ago. Used it for a couple outings with the camera and found it to be too much trouble with access to controls. It collects dust now.
3,Not worth the price,"Ok, so it's a gummy bear cover for your rig. Do not believe the hype, this thing is not going to protect your rig from a drop, BUT, it is good for those who keep their camera handy in the front seat of the car or laying around outside of the pack. It does protect from scratches and incidental damage and the lcd protector is great. I probably would not have bought it if I had seen it in a store. If this thing was like 20 bucks, then it'd be worth getting. Oh, and the lens protector sucks totally. If you have a batter grip on a 30D you'll have to cut/customize this thing to fit properly."
3,Camera Insurance,"I bought this used-exc. conditionAt the price I paid (~$20), it was probably a good piece of insurance for the expensive camera, but don't think it would be worth full price. Difficult to attach tripod (SLIK) with armor in place."
4,Works for swords too!,"I bought this on the recommendation of a fellow swordsman. I needed a hard case to take my katana on the airplane without paying excess baggage charges. This case is going to be perfect.I added some extra thick/firm foam in the top and bottom of the case, and will insulate the katana with another two cut out circles of foam in the middle. The sword will be completely immobile within the case, and it's lockable with one TSA cable lock, or two TSA padlocks.Perfect!"
1,Junk.,"This is nothing but plastic, not only will it not protect your rod or rod(s) but it also broke the tip off mine. I am returning mine and getting a better built and better designed case. Stay away from this overpriced cheap junk!"
2,Smaller than Expected,This item was a lot smaller than I had expected it to be. They are nice but are only about 1 inch tall if that and maybe good for one person and one serving. I returned mine after being strongly disappointed at the size.
3,parent teacher,These receiver gloves would have been great if they fit. The youth large were quite small. We ended up going with a glove we purchased locally. The Cutters would be fine if you're confident about the size. My son loves his gloves as do many of his friends who have them.
4,Good fit,These gloves were for my son who plays football. He really liked them because the size runs small; the way he likes to wear his gloves.
4,"Excellent Gloves, perfect for casual and competitive play","I have played with other gloves before like the Nike VaporJets and an Under Armour pair and these cutter gloves are definitively better. The ""tack"" is stickier on day one and stays that way longer. In between games I wipe them with a wetwipe and it clears aways debris and dust from previous games and nearly bringing them back to ""good as new"" quality. The other gloves that I have played with while just as good one day 1 lose their tack more quickly than the Cutters."
3,check size on cutters website,"These gloves run really small. WE tried another brand on in the store and thought my son could fit in a youth large, but they were way too small. He actually needed an Adult Medium. Make sure to go to the cutters website and they have a measuring tool to use.But they are excellent gloves for sure."
5,By far the funniest,"This movie is by far the funniest 'misunderstanding' movie I've ever seen. It's silly and fun, has a great plot, and the characters are perfect. Tyler Labine and Jesse Moss did some really great work acting out two dynamic roles. The gentleness of one character versus the creepy evil of the other was the ideal contrast. This movie makes me laugh every time I see it. The lines are awesome. The setting and circumstances made for some really unusual action. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. You must watch it."
5,Awesome movie,This movie is so funny! It's a movie we watch over and over again. We would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great comedy.
5,Well Worth It,This is a must see movie that mocks many slasher films. It is well worth the rental fee and well worth watching.
4,A Lot Of Fun,"I won't go as far as the lat reviewer and say this is better than Sean Of The Dead, but this movie is a lot of fun and a great twist on the young kids getting slaughtered genre. Tucker and Dale are about as lovable as any character I've seen in a movie since Hit Girl in Kick Ass. Horror movie fans should get a big kick out of this, so spark one, pour one and sit back for a good time."
5,Absolutely Briliiant,"A horror in reverse. A welcome addition in a over-saturated genre, and a good commentary on the highly suspicious nature of today's folks."
4,"Simple, Good Fun!","Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a great movie. Don't expect the best slasher movie of all time, and don't expect Deliverance. Its a PBR soaked comedic romp. Something you and your buddys would watch in the other room when your girlfriends wanted to watch the Notebook. Ends somewhat predictably but honestly thats half the fun. I would recommend it."
4,Get past the half hour,"The beginning is tough to sit through since the movie seems like it's going to focus on the college kids the whole time. The movie takes a turn once they introduce the ""hillbillies"" and you see they're good regular people. After that, it's all laughs (some gruesome) between the feuding sides. And if you like Alan Tudyk from Knight's Tale or Firefly, then give it a watch because he does a good job here. No regrets here. Watch!"
4,Close to amazing,"This is so close to being amazing. They didn't ""knock it out of the park"", but did deliver a consistently fun, respectably gruesome, and regularly heartwarming movie. Not a bad accomplishment.Definitely recommended if you love or hate horror movies and best seen knowing as little about the movie as possible - avoid the trailer if you can."
5,Great movie,"It has to be one of the funniest, scary stories that isn't a spoof. We laughed so much and several of the acters in the movie are people that I like so that was a bonus."
4,We came for funny and it delivered,"It plays on classic movie stereotypes and does a good job at it. I thought the two rednecks were the best and the college kids did a good job as well. A tale of missed placed identifications based on standardized social concepts with a real psycho mixed in. Good laughs along the way! The movie began tapering off for me about half way through, but it was still worth the ride. All in all a good movie."
5,INSTANT CULT CLASSIC,This is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time! Just plain fun. Alan Tudyk is perfect in this fun flick!
5,Laugh out loud funny,My 63 year old mother almost fell out of her chair laughing at this movie. I have not seen a movie this funny in a long time.
5,******Must see to believe*******,WOW WOW WOW Watch this movie just watch it - buy it - rent it or do the 1 month prime trial as I am doing but just watch this freaking movie ! Deserves every star for originality acting plenty of gut busting laughs and some terror thrown in for good measure. Two thumbs up or what ever fingers remaining.
2,broke,Movie was good arrived in time...but the CD case was broken badly! I was afraid the movie was damaged!!! Other than that good...
4,Hilarious Good Gory Fun!!!,"This movie was a lot better than I expected. I watched this with some friends on New Year's Eve. It was a very funny and clever take on the horror/comedy genre. Two innocent redneck hillbillies named Tucker and Dale are on their way to a run-down cabin in the woods for a Memorial Day vacation. They run into some college kids that mistake them for maniacal psychos. When Allison of the group falls in the lake, Tucker and Dale save her, but Allison's friends assume they kidnapped her. Thru a bunch of hilarious misunderstandings, the kids begin to die in gory ways. I would definitely recommend TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL!!!"
5,Loved it!!!,"Perfect Horror comedy date movie for all your friends to enjoy! Hilarity, blood, guts, love, and beer. This one will keep you laughing."
4,Fun Film,If you're looking for a quirky horror comedy film that feels a little bit like Shaun of the Dead but is unique. This might just be the film you're looking for.
4,Not what I thought vs Evil would be about,I already enjoy watching the the two main actors in this movie and with them working together I suspected I would really enjoy the movie. That is a big understatement. It is so funny and shows what a simple misunderstanding can lead to when things get taken out of context. In a lot of ways this is really Dale & Tucker vs Stupid. And they kick stupid into next week!
5,"""They Cut Off His Bowlin"" Fingers!""...","TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL takes on the stereotypical ""killer hillbilly"" movie (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, WRONG TURN, etc.) by turning the entire sub-genre inside out! Through accident, misunderstanding, and assumption, a comedy of errors becomes a bloodbath! If you love horror / comedies, then this one is a must! It's right up there w/ classics like SEAN OF THE DEAD and THE COTTAGE! Watch immediately!..."
2,"Too violent for comedy, too light hearted for horror.","The juxtaposition of extreme violence with the light hearted comedy in this movie just didn't work. All the actors did a fine job, especially Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk (he could play a terrifying bad guy in a horror flick), but seeing a man jammed into a wood chipper, another impaled on a fallen tree, and Alan Tudyk tortured isn't funny. The attempt at humor alongside these scenes were crass rather than funny. The violence in this movie was simply too extreme to think that this movie could be considered a comedy. And all the attempts at comedy kept the movie from being a decent horror movie."
3,Dumb but loving it,"A very humorous twist on the college kids v. the crazed hillbillies. Lots of stuff to indicate a B movie, but more laughs than a lot of the big budget 'comedies"". Have a few beers, some friends and a good laugh."
5,Hilarious!!,"I thought this was gonna be stupid, but it was soo funny! ""Officer we've had just a doozie of a day!"""
5,Funniest movie of the year!,I love this movie! I saw it over 100 times and still think this is the most hilarious movie of the year! Good story + good acting = good movie.
5,Funny,Well written well acted. Hilarious incidents that happen. Things go south hilariously and quickly. Tucker and Dale themselves are quite funny and endearing characters
3,"Interesting twists, horror comedy",It had several interesting plot twists but wasn't always that funny. It could have had a lot more action and a faster moving plot.
5,A cult classic for sure,"Ok, you have to have a specific fondness for cult classic movies and gore/horror to like this movie but if you DO like movies like that, you will love this movie. Lets be honest. It IS toilet humor and it's for people that just want a good laugh.Tucker and Dale at first are mistaken (by college kids) for psycho hillbillie rednecks. We soon see they are just 2 friends that just want their PBR and to go fishing. The kids are so paranoid of Tucker and Dale that, they end up killing their own friends. Gruesome deaths galore here folks.It is a hilarious spoof on the horror genre and people who stereotype others.BEES!!!!! (look up the trailer)Well made, and fun to watch."
4,hilarious,"i was not going to rent this, but then i read the reviews. yes, it is very funny. thank you amazon reviewers. without you i might have missed this little gem,"
5,Great Comedy Horror,"I am difficult to please with horror comedy. I will not even mention the popular horror comedies i don't like to avoid haters... but this movie; PERFECT! I enjoyed every last frame of this film and other than lack of female input on the commentary from our female lead and... um 2 of the special features seemed to just repeat the same material i couldn't be any happier with it. The commentary was great, the movie was a blast and the bonuses were decent."
3,Three Stooges type of comedy,"This is a movie to watch when your in the mood for slap-stick humor. My son thought it was hysterical. I don't think my 20 year old daughter would enjoy it though. Definitely not a chick-flick. Its male humor, all the way through."
5,Love this Film,"Have Watched over and over again, huge fan of 80's Slasher films, or films made now a days to be in that period."
3,"""It's true... you're half hillbilly."" -The Blonde","If I were to rate this movie simply on the performances by the two stars (Tucker and Dale, of course), this movie would get five stars. They're hilarious hillbillies who have a real knack for capturing the essence of the characters. Though bumbling and largely uninformed, they're well balanced by large quantities of humor, charm, and loyalty.I really enjoyed the ""spin"" that this movie puts on the classic ""college kid horror flick"", spoofing on many of the conventions of the old, tired genre. Oftentimes, it's hilarious. Yet, there was something off about the pacing, which prevented me from getting into the movie full swing. It just couldn't hold my attention. I had to watch it in 20-30 minute spurts, and then come back to it several days later, until I finally finished it. Nonetheless, it's a unique movie, and fans of the genre will undoubtedly be delighted."
1,Repetitive and obnoxious,"It's been awhile since I've encountered an album that was genuinely challenging to suffer through from start to finish, but this little abomination definitely broke the streak. Every track is just as irritating and uninspired as the last. The no-guitar no-bass concept is interesting, but the talentless songwriting and repetition gave me a headache. Dreadful release."
4,MATES of STATE ROCK,"i saw mates of state recently and as soon as they struck the first note i was a fan. They bring a smile to your face even when you don't want it. Live, they are amazing, they actually make you want to dance and sing, and i didn't even know the words and i don't dance. I guess i could say that the mates of state make you do things you don't want to but that might make them sound like cult leaders...maybe they are. anyway i dont care because they rock."
1,I'm with deal,"This may be why amateur reviewers have some credibility problems, at least if they don't go into specifics. Here's a couple: repeating a fairly lame percussion riff from the first cut all thru the rest of the album doesn't cut it. And since this isn't an aggro type release, perhaps the voices should blend rather than collide. I want my $8 back."
1,what is the deal?,I don't understand these reviews! This band could not possibly be more obnoxious! Every songsounds exactly the same as the last one. There are so many better bands out there.... save your money..
3,No denouement,"No doubt Diehl is a master wordsmith, but based on this book, he is not a plot master. There is no denouement, no classical catharsis. In the end the villain wins--even Vail doesn't deserve that. Put another way, even though the protagonist (Vail) wins the court battle, he loses the existential battle, which is far more important. Some readers love this kind of ambiguous ending, obviously. I prefer the protagonist to be the clear winner."
3,a good book with bad ending,this book is never dull. but it contains only little suspense. the ending makes the whole book looks bad! (can an intelligent boy hide in a 'closet' after murdering someone?)
5,Better than Grisham,"I must say that I bought this book by seeing an ad of the movie on the TV, but while the movie hadn't come up in Brazil I read it. I've never heard about Diehl before, but as I turned the pages ( fast indeed ), I realized that he is a very good writer, able to create characters that you simply love.vail is the bad-boy counselour that must take the defense of the angel-looking Stampler, accused of the murder of a weel-known bishop in Chicago. As he goes deep in the investigation of the crime, th real truth about stampler begins to come out. And it's amazing, to the last page. Even if the end is kind of predictable, you keep reading just to confirm if it's what you're thinking.When I found out about the sequel to this novel, named "" Show of Evil "", I went right to the bookstore to buy it. And I hope that it makes me stay awake in the night just as "" Primal "" has"
1,bad,"Sorry, all of you who gave this 5 stars. I thought it was terrible. I knew the murderer before the end of the first cassette. (unabridged edition) I hated Martin Vail. There was not a sixties stereotype left unused. I knew the final twist before the end of the 2nd cassette (no I did not see the movie). By the way, someone should tell Mr. Diehl or his editor that ""keeping two steers for breeding"" is a fruitless occupation."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"After reading a glowing review, I purchased this case for my son's band trip to Hawaii. The case itself seems very sturdy. Hard plastic and good padding inside. My issue is with the latches which seem very weak(cheap) compared to the rest of the case. They don't snap down very tightly and have an upturned edge that causes them to catch on things and pop open. There is no way to lock them down to prevent this. The middle latch does accommodate a luggage lock which we used. Because of the latches, I would not recommend this case be used for checked baggage. Even for everyday use, it would be necessary to put a lock on the middle latch to prevent the case from unexpectedly popping open."
3,The good songs haven't dated,"An album worth owning for the handful of songs that don't sound like old Chili Pepper throwaways. Porno for Pyros works best when the group chases a melodic simplicity to a fruitful end, but feels strained at times when the heavy rock-riffing flails about. For the half that does succeed Perry Farrel and company create some memorable early 90's alternative pop, elitist Jane's Addiction fans be damned."
2,"2 stars for 2 good songs...the rest, well...","basically the two songs that make this album worth purchasing and/or keeping are ""black girlfriend"" and ""pets"", thats it! the rest of the album suffers from stupid lyrics,stupid music, and stupid lyrics. buy ""GOOD GOD'S URGE"" instead, its an A+! only buy this album if you find it used or on the clearance rack...i agree with the other reviewers on this one..."
2,I recently threw this one in the trash.,What makes this CD so bad is Perry Farrell's lyrics. These are the stupidest lyrics ever and really take away any enjoyment you might gain from some of the percussion work (which is why I'm giving this one two stars instead of one). I've tried to listen to this album several times over the years and cringe each time Perry sings. He screeches rather than sings. His worst work ever in my opinion.
4,great stuff,"Jane's Addiction was a powerful machine whose passing I lament as much as the next guy. If you can get past their demise and view Porno as a completely different band, this album has a lot to offer. The song selections are diverse, quirky, and well-played. Great lyrics. I particularly like the foreboding ""Blood Rag"" which features spiraling guitars that really convey the feeling of butterflys-in-your-stomach desperation and fear. All the tracks are really good although I don't particularly like ""Sadness."" ""Cursed Male,"" ""Packin' .25,"" ""Black Girlfriend"" and ""Orgasm"" are all stand-outs."
3,"Pretty good, but not quite as good as Jane's","As you may already know, this bad was formed after the unfortunate demise of Jane's Addiction. The CD has some very Jane's-like songs on them. My favorties are Sadness, Meija (most favorite), and Bad S*&t. They seem to be trying too hard at times to sound like Janes but can't pull it off without Dave Navarro at the helm. But Perry really carries the band this time, and it's almost enough. I suppose this is more like a Perry Farrel solo album than his past work. Pets was an overplayed FM song but it's the most unique and interesting song on the CD. If you don't already own every Jane's Addiction CD, then get them all first before going here. I also think that Porno's follow-up ""Good Gods Urge"" is a vast improvement over this and is also a more worthwhile buy."
3,Great!!,"This is a really good job of perry farrel and co., maybe not as better as Good God's Urge, with an interesting mix between explosive and quiet songs, in my opinion the bestone is ""pets"".If you like perry farrel's voice you should buy this cd."
4,A great album.,"I only give 4 stars because only the first three Jane's Addiction albums deserves five stars (being of ""classic"" status). I assume that this would have been the fourth Jane's album if they did not make the mistake of breaking up. This is a great album and should be in every Jane's Addiction fan's collection. The music is really that good and, like Jane's Addiction, that original. Listen to the excerpts and judge for yourself. I doubt you will be sorry. Unfortunatly the following Porno For Pyros album lacked the luster that the debut had."
4,"""New Jearsey?""","Who is this guy from ""New Jearsey?"" If his musical taste is half as bad as his spelling (keep in mind he can't even spell his home state), then Porno for Pyros' first album is a classic.Objectively speaking, the recording stands pretty tall on its own merits."
4,Porno For Pyros keeps the magic alive,"I am totally discusted with these sad attempts for reviews. This album is a masterpiece in it's own catagory. No it's not Jane's, Nor is it supposed to be. I have listened to this album hundreds of times and every time I find new things hidden inside. Sure I admit it is something to put on before you go to sleep or to start the day off. But this album is far from sucking! Go out and get this first album by P.for P., it's a must for any true collector of good music. P.S. vinal still rules!!"
2,Big deal......,"Halford forms a new outfit, release a studio album and then a live album..... Iron Maiden puts together its best line-up again, release a studio album and then a live album... What do these two acts have in common?Answer: the same greedy manager, Rod Smallwood. It makes no sense for Halford release an album after just one solo LP (as ""HALFORD""), and fill it with Priest songs."
2,Sounds like a fake,"What I really dislike about this CD is the lack of feel for a live recording. There are no transitions between songs that places you at the concert. It is simply a set of recordings from several concerts put on two CDs. That's the best news. Most of the CD sounds overdubbed and [unoriginal]. Listen to the crowd - clearly there are additional dubbs of crowd noise that goes from very loud to almost silent in a fraction of a second. Listen to Robs voice - sounds like, at many times, layers of vocals were added.The net result is an average collection of greatest hits almost live. I much prefer the Live Meltdown CD because it sounds live with lots of crowd excitement. This is how a live CD should sound.One last note - where are ""The Ripper"" or ""Green Manalishi"" or ""Diamonds and Rust""? Leaving these songs of the list and including songs like ""Cyberworld""[?]..."
5,Amazing,"I expected a lot from this album and got even more than I bargained for; this is truly incredible. With the exception of ""Slow Down"" (and only because I'm just not a fan of the song), every track is a winner. While I think ""Resurrection"" sounds a bit better on the album, it still comes off very well here. It's also great to hear some old Priest tunes re-energized with much heavier guitars behind them. Finally, ""Screaming in the Dark"" bodes very well for the next studio effort. Of course, Halford's voice has to be commented on. Does anyone else sound so good at his age? The guy's in his 50's! I honestly don't know how it's possible for him to be hitting those notes after so many years and so many shows... It is clear now that Halford is THE heavy metal vocalist of all time - no one else even comes close (Ian Gillian and Ronnie Dio being more hard rock singers, in my opinion, and they don't sound nearly so great as they once did). Buy this album."
5,He is THE Metal God!,Halford's last album was awesome. Seeing him live was even more impressive. I'm amazed at how he has been able to capture that power and presence on this double CD. He hits most of the highs of Priest as well as his new material from the studio and Fight while still including some more obscure Priest material.Halford proves why Heavy Metal involves a singer who can scream rather than rap.Get this CD ... you won't regret it.
5,I am awestruck!,"After hearing Halford's debut album and seeing them twice on tour, I was looking forward to the new live release. Halford sounds better live than in the studio. They have elevated their skillful playing with astounding vocals by Rob Halford, great duo guitar riffs, and excellent drumming. The two cd set is a must buy for all metal fans. I think this will perhaps be a yardstick to measure future live albums. There is nothing amateurish in production about the album. If you have doubts that Rob Halford can no longer hit high notes, listen to tracks such as ""Silent Screams"", ""Hell's Last Survivor"", ""Sad Wings"", and ""Screaming in the Dark"". Be prepared to be stunned by the intensity of Live--Insurrection!"
5,"ROCK HARD, RIDE FREE, METAL LIVES FOR EVER!!!","HELLO METALHEADS!THIS CD IS FOR ANYBODY WHO IS A JUDAS PRIEST FAN FROM WAY BACK OR METAL FAN AS FAR AS THAT GOES. HIS NEW STUFF ON THIS PIECE OF WORK SOUNDS LIKE IT CAME OUT IN 1986 WITH THE NEW SCHOOL SOUND. THIS IS THE BEST THING I'VE HEARD FOR HIM IN A LONG TIME AND HE HAS A VERY ""IN SHAPE"" SOUNDING BAND THIS TIME AROUND. DOUBLE BASS DRUM, DOUBLE PICKING GUITAR, SCREACHING VOCALS, DEFINITELY CHECK THIS DOUBLE CD OUT AND YOU'LL GET A COLLECTION OF GREAT JUDAS PRIEST AND ALL ROBS SOLO STUFF. WORTH THE BUY!! ROCKSTEADY ALWAYS!!"
4,Hit the jackpot!!,"I don't know the amount of overdubs this live release received in the studios, but whateve it was, Halford hit the jackpot here, definitely.The album is explosive, tight, strong. The band paly ferociously and with precision. The JUdas Priest tunes presented here shine as bright as ever, fresh. The Halford original's also work very well.It's a live album with no, I repeat, NO weak spots, no fillers. Even fans like myself who were not familiarized with FIGHT will enjoin its songs. Amazing"
4,Short stories collection,"These are a collection of stories of guys growing up on the street of New York. The stories deal with relationship, missing fathers, prostitution, teasing, and other things teens go through. The stories make you think. I throught some of the stories ended kinda of strange, but they were still good."
2,Barebones Writer Too Lean for My Taste,"I looked forward to this collection because of the comparisons the publishers (read: marketing department) made to Sherman Alexie and Junot Diaz--two quite accomplished young writers. I breezed through the collection rather quickly (it is that short and uncomplicated) and realized that this pseudo-minimalism relies heavily on ""voice"" or ""attitude"" rather and not much on the textures (such as landscape and history) that have made Alexie and Diaz favorites among the critics. The voices in these stories suffer from lack of bodies, ungrounded to the rich soil that is New York. At first I thought this was done deliberately, perhaps a commentary on the disenfranchised or the displaced persons. But by the end I knew that this writer needed one more year of graduate school to polish this project. Much luck on the next one."
3,I don't see the big fuss over this,"Natalie Dessay can sing the high notes and do the trills and her voice is clear and agile, but one has the feeling she is picking her way until she reaches the coloratura bits. While there is nothing wrong with her singing, it is just NOT very engaging. Some of the coloratura passage leaves listener unsatisfied. Unlike other singers, you don't feel the built-up the the 'big moment'. And even in those moments, she slows down and let the tension slips away. One can only wonder what it would be like, if she can built up her arias like Callas, or attack her coloratura passage like Sumi Jo.Try listing to Mady Mesple in the Bell Song, Sumi Jo in Der Holle Rache, Suterland in the Doll Song, Callas in Ah Je Veux..."
4,Excellent Sound,"Fabulous sound and songs from a GREAT artist! Go Bryan Adams!!! And for goodness sake, PLEASE make ""Diana"" more available in the USA! Such a fabulous song should not be hidden away on a small compilation!!"
2,The cheapest of Chinese made junk,"Cool games, but it couldn't have been made any cheaper. The pegs are cheap plastic and were made with awful molds. The plastic is not smooth and has all kinds of deformities. The holes are drilled too large so the pegs lean. The directions are impossible to understand without reading many times. It's obvious that someone in an ESL class wrote them: Typical directions: FOR TWO PLAYERS PLAYER ROLLS BOTH DICE TO GET INTO THE NUMBER 1 POSITION PLAYER MUST ROLL A 5 ON ONE DICE OR ANY TWO NUMBERS THAT AMOUNT TO 5 NEXT PLAYER PROCEEDS IN SAME MANNER TO MOVE ON TO NUMBER 2 POSITION PLAYER MUST ROLL A TWO ON ONE DICE..."" What the heck does that mean? Spend a little more and get a good version of these games."
4,Livin' On The Edge CD Single W/Demo Version And 2 Unreleased Songs,Great single with Acoustic and Demo version Of 'Livin On The Edge' and two unreleased tracks; Don't Stop and Can't Stop Messin'. A must for true Aerosmith fans.
1,Too much Theory,"I was looking for ""How To"" Day trading book. Reading this book was torture. I felt Mr. Eng was trying harder to impress upon the reader his vast knowledge of the theory of economics, rather than teaching one how to day trade. I admit, I couldn't force myself to read the whole book. By the time I finished part two, feeling I'd gained nothing out of those 186 awful pages, I moved on to more exciting authors."
1,Don't waste your money as I did!,"Way too much unusable information. I kept waking up throughout the book, hoping to get to the parts about day-trading I could put into practice. (It never happened)"
2,Buyer's remorse,"Although this book appears at first glance to contain an impressive discussion of technical analysis as it may be applied to day trading, a more thorough reading reveals that the author wholly fails to explain how the reader can use these technical tools to improve his/her daytrading skills. This book certainly is not for the beginning trader and is not worth its relatively steep price."
2,An out-of-date book with some useful ideas.,"I returned this book primarily because it is fairly dated, given the technical advances in electronic trading since the publication date of 1993. I am a fairly active trader and have an earned doctorate in physics; Mr. Eng's discussions of Chaos, Entropy and Randomness left me with the suspicion that scientific buzzwords are employed to justify the empirical ideas of chart analysis. Friedfertig and West's 1998 book, The Electronic Day Trader, is a far more useful and current title."
1,A disapointing book,"With all due respect to Mr. Eng, the book really skimped on detail. It mentioned myriads of techniques and styles, but failed to provide adequate information to fully understand them or actually use them. Instead, in almost every case, the reader was referred to another book, usually written by Mr. Eng. If I had known I needed all his previous works to use this one, I wouldn't have wasted my time. As it is, I sent the book back."
1,Truly awful!,"This may be the worst book I've ever read. Characters and plot straight out of a cartoon. Really bad science. Silly premise. And the main character was so busy worrying about himself and God's will he simply overlooked the need to call the police - a common sense action that might have actually saved a few lives along the way. Instead, this utterly warped and improbable ending tried to make him both heroic and holy."
3,Not so happy,I was expecting to see a book and not a small paperback. I received this in one month and I found out that the content of this is available for reading all on the sportspectator site. Anyway they are selling this for a good cause.With the money for this book and shipping taxes I could have bought a better book.
5,Great Matches,"A great mma dvd, if you want to see great mma action this is a good one to get. Remember the UFC just could not compete with Pride so they bought them out and put them under.Dont worry this is mma fighting not like the UFC where guys would just lay on top of each other for the entire match doing minimal fighting,with the announcers telling you how great they are.In Pride they would force the fighters to get up and fight, there isnt the politics and fixed matches that are so common in the UFC."
3,"Okay, but not real clear","This book does show all of the different colors but I didn't like the way they were presented as being paint brushes. Seemed a little confusing to explain to a 2 year old. Probably wouldn't order this one again, but loved the other Barney Goes to the Zoo book."
4,"Love this simple, wonderful tool!","My very sweet grandparents purchased this for me, and it has been wonderful. The simple design is easy to use, and it doesn't look bad either. Great tool!"
3,Honest review:,"I read the reviews on this book prior to purchasing it. I also noted the reference to another book: LIVING WITH LIMOGES and I purchased it. Of course I compared the two. LIVING WITH LIMOGES is FANTASTIC and has an entire section on WEARING YOUR LIMOGES that is informative, professional and has fabulous photographs of thousands of hand painted pieces. The quality of Living With Limoges is much better than this book Painted Porcelain. I personally don't like paperback books and Painted Porcelain is a paperback. I thought I would enjoy both but my recommendation - don't bother spending the money on paperback reference books -- put your money toward the better book."
1,I was hoping for more...,"This book really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. I was expecting some more detail in the maps, and only a couple events in each state were highlighted. There were some really big cases completely ignored that I thought deserved attention more than the ones that he chose. California's Zodiac Killer and Florida's University of Florida Gainesville College Murders were among those that I was surprised to see were overlooked. I can only recommend this if you're looking for scant information on a very limited number of cases. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
5,Denmark in a nutshell !,"DK Eyewitness travel books are my go-to book for all trips to new countries. They are packed with info, pictures, must-see sights, maps, customs, currency, how to get around, where to shop & what to buy, even what to eat while you're there! A must have for travel to new places! Highly recommended."
2,It was on the way to be good...but didn't make it,"The graphics are great. It is a very beautiful guide. But the information in it is rather incomplete.For example: If you want to go to any place (i.e. a museum), the guide tells you which bus/train/metro take, but doesn't tell you where to stop and what to do in order to get to the place from the bus stop. And the guide also lacks of ""real"" travelers information: which are the museums that haf discouns with the ""copenhagen card"", etc.The guide doesn't seem to transmit if the author has a ""hands on"" experience. It is a rather ""cold"" book. You feel a profesional writer in the book, not a real traveler."
4,Poncho at his best,I was very happy to hear the group performing at a high level of energy. I really like this CD.
2,Cute but not practical,"We bought this sleeping bag at another store because my son is such a ""Wiggle fanatic"" and he hated the sleeping bag due to it's 100% polyester content. It's hard to snuggle up and get cozy in 100% polyester. Finally we brought it back, really too bad. But children's merchandise should also be as good in quality as what we adults like to sleep on-100% cotton. If you don't mind polyester, it should be a good buy. Otherwise I would not recommend it."
3,A milestone in the career of a versatile artist.,"Many of us Fleetwood Mac fans know Stevie Nicks' side to the story; here, Lindsey tells us his, in understated rage and hurt. This is the man who plays every instrument on his record, who is responsible for the many musical and lyrical nuances. Stevie wears her heart on her lace sleeve; Lindsey challenges us to find him through material more experimental than his songs on Fleetwood Mac's ""Tusk"" album. Other than ""Trouble,"" with its perfect guitar solo, this is not what some of us might expect. Some songs are less than perfect; but the creativity and thematic unity of the album as a whole helps redeem even the less than perfect parts. That one man could have done 96% of this, literally by himself, is in itself impressive. This is a record which deserves our respect."
3,Very Good Buck,"I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. I am afraid that monsefu@aol.com is a little prejudiced having given each of Lindsey's albums 5 stars. This is a good first solo album. The song ""Trouble"" is one of the finest Fleetwood Mac songs ever--most of the band was involved (if not all) I like this album overall--a little strange in places and a little dated in others. But I like it--though I do not listen to it very often anymore. His take on LA with the coughing background singers is classic!!!"
2,Maybe It'll Grow on You?,"Having bought ""Out of the Cradle"" first, I was disappointed in ""Law and Order"". Besides the song Trouble, it's kind of disjointed. You have to be a real Lindsey fanatic to like this one."
2,terrable!!!,"Iam a big fan of lindsey's work in Fleetwood Mac but this was terrable!!! It just goes to show he is nothing with out Stevie Nicks. I was a fool in buying something i never hered about before. I should have listen to my mum and got Sevie's new album, ""Trouble in Shangri-La"" which is doing exelent on the radio and charts. The only reason i gave it a 2 star is because i feel sorry for him!!"
4,Trouble is HOT!,"Okay, so I admit the reason I rate this a four star album is for one cut...Trouble. For me that one song is worth the price of the CD. I could play it over and over and never tire of it. Granted it has special memories for me (it came out when I was in college), but there is something about the song...Lindsey's voice, the beat, the instrumentation, all of it combines to create one of those songs that I haven't forgotten in all of these years. Everyone has a few of ""those kind of songs"" hanging around; if it grabs you, that's it; you're hooked, and I'm hooked on Trouble. The rest of the album has a few cool songs and some not so cool. But it was a brave effort on Lindsey's part and I salute him for it. And like I say, Trouble is worth the price."
4,"Law upheld, order more-or-less withstanding","Three of the five members of Fleetwood Mac from their chart-topping period--Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, and Christine McVie--have had successful careers on their own, most of all Nicks, unjustly. But I suspect Buckingham has the most talent. Case in point, ""Law and Order,"" his debut, which dives off from the aggressive pseudomacho new wave experimentation of Buckingham's ""Tusk"" compositions, one track after another rife with colour, quirk, and energy, drowning in studio wizardry. If nowhere else, Buckingham is a genius in the studio: these eleven tracks are impeccably produced, so much so that it would cheapen the record if the songs weren't so good. Not that there's anything brilliant about the songs, really, not even the smooth-on-the-ears, heavy-on-the-heart ""Trouble,"" which pierced the Top Ten (#9) in '81 (how about that?). They're just good songs with great production. In this case, that's plenty."
5,YEAAHH!,"Lindsey,Thanks for a lifetime of wonderful music. When I heard ''Trouble'' again I had the opportunity to dance with my beautiful three year old daughter and share a very magical moment with her. God bless you and your family and thanks for sharing your gift with us.Ted"
3,Read the Online Help for Project Pro and PWA,I was somewhat disappointed. The things I had questions about weren't covered any more deeply in this book than in the Microsoft Help. Download and read the Microsoft Online books that cover administering and installing Project Server for a free alternative.
3,A good start,"I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I have a background in ornamental plaster and enjoyed learning about the various finishes that can be applied to plaster. It does not really get into any mold making but does show some process...I think the book is primarily useful for those interested in faux finishing. If you restore picture frames or other ornamental plaster work, this is a good reference. They also have a good list of suppliers in the back. Also...those art teachers out there...good ideas for working with kids on simple class projects. Buy the book and keep it around as reference."
5,Merbow's Musical Reverence For An Elephant Seal,"Merzbow dedicated these tracks to an elephant seal that perished in captivity. The master of sound may be the coolest animal rights activist in music. Minazo is wonderfully reminiscent of ""Merzbuta"" and ""Merzbird"". The sound is at times mellow, celestial, hard, harsh and riveting. Mr. Akita (Merzbow) also writes a compelling essay about why animals in captivity should be done so for conservation and not exploitation. The Japanese noise virtuoso is getting better with age. Listeners must keep in mind that even when Merzbow inundates you with overpowering sounds; they are emanating from a very talented artist who has a heart of gold. Minazo is a MUST BUY for diehard Merzbow fans. Also buy Merzbuta and Merzbird."
1,Avoid VOD at all costs,"I've never had so much as a single issue with anything I've ever ordered from Amazon (whether it was real-world product sent to my P.O. box, or videos/music downloaded directly to my PC), but my purchase of this VOD was utterly abhorrent: the video quality is detestable (even considering the 1995 release date of the film), and I have absolutely no control whatsoever over the aspect ratio on my screen. Even though I watch on a wide-screen monitor, it evidentally isn't wide enough; the frame view (along the horizontal, even with a 1920 x 1080 resolution) is all crammed together, making the film (along the verticle) appear stretched and drawn.I'm angry that I spent the money on this download, and if it were possible for me to rate it anywhere below one-star, I certainly would. Save your money, folks, from this abortion of a VOD, and spend it elsewhere. If you absolutely MUST have this movie, go to a retailer for the DVD or BluRay ... someplace like Target, Walmart, etc, etc."
4,"Thatta Boy, Tommy!","Chris Farley and David Spade's first movie together is a treasure. Tommy (Farley) is a slow, dim-wit with a big heart and Richard (Spade) is an annoying, conceded little punk who harrasses Tommy. The chemistry that they share is great and they make this movie memorable. Callahan Auto sells brake pads and ensures the safety of all of their clients. When Tommy's father dies, it's up to Tommy and Richard to sell enough to stay in business. However, Tommy's mother-in-law wants all of the Callahan wealth and only pretends to be a loving person. What a witch! Meanwhile, the boys go on a road trip and sing songs. Oh, happy days! They hit a deer which is still alive, Tommy ruins some model toys, he gets hit in the face countless times and Tommy eventually saves the company. Dan Aykroyd plays his number one competitor and they have a mutual agreement. This movie will have you laughing and crying. To avoid getting a ticket say, ""Oh my God, killer bees!"""
3,poor sound quality,"The picture was fine but sound kept going in and out on some of the speakers. I've watched other movies on the platform and haven't experienced problems with the sound. I can only guess that it is the DVD. good movie, though."
5,My Review,"I loved this movie.I loved david spade and chris farley and i thought they did an A+ job together in this.This movie was funny and serious all in the same thing,and thats what i loved about it!"
4,"So funny, I couldn't breathe","This is one of my all time favorite movies along with the Naked Gun Series, Billy Madison, Waterboy, Dumb and Dumber, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. My five favorite moments are as follows:1.When David Spade's rug blew off his head 2. The ""fat guy in a little coat"" 3.Chris Farley changing his clothes in the bathroom 4.The part when Chris ruined the guy's collectable cars 5.The ""housekeeping"" scene If you want 2 hours of non-stop laughter, get this movie at any conveniently located [video rental]. You don't know what you're missing!"
3,Chris Farley Is The Best!,"This is one of my favourites of all time. Chris Farley joins David Spade in this one, trying to sell car parts to other companies. The thing is, will they succeed? That's the big question. They really make fools of themselves in this one. That's why this one is funny.This is one of Chris Farley and David Spade's best comedies. Get it, and see for yourself."
4,Tommy Boy,The movie Tommy Boy is about two guys that are going on a trip. This movie is a comedy movie. This movie is about two hours long. In the middle of the movie it gets to be very detailing and more funny. At the end Tommy is very heartbreaking because his dad dies. This movie was produced in 1995.Cody S.
5,Hilarious!,You will not be disappointed.I love this movie.Totally cracks me up!I think I'll watch it again this weekend!There is actually a story line too!
2,"""FAT GUY IN A LITTLE COAT""","10 STARS!!!!!! The title shows the new hit single on MTV. JK, but this is the definitely the funniest movie I have seen in years, I laughed myself off the couch when I was watching the seen where the hood flew up and when Tommy [Farley] was singing, ""Fat Guy In A Little Coat"". ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS. THIS IS NOT RENTAL MATERIAL, one of the funniest movies ever made, I gurantee it. GRAB YOUR COPY today and be sure to remember to say;""LUKE, I AM YOUR FATHER"" with a fan next time, it enchances the SOUND!!!!!!"
1,The Worst Movie In The World,"Okay, I'll make this short. I hated this movie. The first time I watched it it was amazing and really funny- 5 stars.But the second time nothing was funny. It's those jokes that you don't want to hear more than once.Do not buy this video. Rent it. Watch it three or fout times. I think you won't like it much either."
1,Are we all nuts?,"Mr Lubitsch is in great danger as it seems that a strange craze (a TV-spread virus?) has landed on the audiences -I just hope not on every viewer. A great movie? Yeah, right, that's a good one for parties. Now c'mon, let's be serious. If we could call this a movie it would be very generous of us. Guess it is too late for the already spoilt. Too bad Mr Wilder and Mr Lubitsch have not succeeded in showing people the true meaning of ""funny"". They did not know that brains of the human genre (as it seems) were going to shrink down in a few years'time since they passed away."
4,Great movie! Great laughs! Great Version!!!,"I bought this version for my brother, and myself! It is the most often quoted movie my brother and I use. It is cool, because we can quote just about any movie quote, in front of our kids. Most other movies we like, are R Rated, and hard to quote.But something about this movie, just keeps the laughs coming.Rent or buy this Holy Schnike version! I managed to get the Tommyboy bobblehead from the Best Buy special offer. My brother really enjoyed this gift.Buy this movie and have a great time! You won't be sorry!MC White said: Check it out!!!"
4,Fun and Campy,"I'm a 62 yr old woman and have seen this movie six or eight times through the years; it's funny, sometimes hilarious, and never one dull moment. It always amuses me to see the critics rate it one star on HBO when viewers hold it in such high esteem~~almost five stars. Chris Farley was one of my favs as is this movie."
5,i cant stop laughing,"This movie is a classic to any teenager. If you go to a random, American highschool, chances are at least 1/2 of the kids there can quote a line from this movie. If you're looking for something to make you laugh and laugh and laugh, but not think at all, Tommy Boy is your movie. Its hilarious! I wish David Spade and Chris Farley could make more movies but, Chris isnt around anymore, and comedy will never be the same. Anyway, Buy this movie if you like real comidies that require absolutely no thinking."
5,a legend,I was a big chris farley fan and I love all his movies but tommy boy was always my favorite I really miss chris farley I always wanted to meet him and tell him how great he was and give him a big hug but chris can relax now in heaven chris farley was the funniest man in the world and he lives on chris farley is a legend.
5,Hahahahahahaha!! Its funny,"Dang this movie was funny!! I think its a comedy movie lovers gotta see movie. It is funny and comes along with a lot of suprises. Just sit back and watch Chris Farley and David Spade take action with a huge task on their hands. They have to sell 250000 brake pads and Tommy (Chris Farley) is a selling dump!! They send Richard (David Spade) with him to help. Richard knows how to sell, but stinks at spicing up his charisma. Then one day the get a break through and come up with an award winning strategy. there is one big proble that you will have to watch to see!! comedy magic."
4,"Better than the original DVD release, but far from perfect","This ""Special Edition"" is nice, but not what it could've been. You will find that the special features are nice. The behind the scenes footage is fun. The interviews with the living cast members are alright. You will find that the deleted scenes and the extended scenes are, for the most part very funny! That's where the DVD fails. I found myself wondering, why didn't Peter Segal make a Director's Cut? Some of the scenes that were cut could've definitely added to this cult classic's comedic appeal. Everybody else is releasing Director's Cuts. This edition deserved that. Bottom Line, if you already own the original release and have no real yearning for special features, save your money. If you really want to expand your Chris Farley library, get your mitts on his SNL Best of Chris Farley and see how it all started. That ""Best of.."" and ""Tommy Boy"" are some of the required lessons that future physical comedians will be taking notes from."
5,High-lar-e-us!,"The classic ""fatty & skinny"" duo of Farley and Spade are the heart and soul of this flick's yucks. Spade as Richard, the anal-retentive, uptight bean-counter learns to love the slobbering, prepetual screw-up played by Chris ""Tommy Boy"" Farley.My favorite scenes: ""Lu-u-u-u-ke I am your father"" where Farley fantasizes into a fan.""Fat guy in a little coat, fat guy in a little coat"" R-i-i-i-p, goes skinny little Richard's coat.The ""dead deer"" in the back of Richard's convertible.The all time classic: Richard, trying to wake up the sleeping Tommy Boy in some cheap motel. Knock, Knock, Knock ""Housekeeping, You want me fluff your pillow"" And then on to more hilarity!"
5,funniest movie,I remember when I first saw this movie I laughed my butt off.And now 9yrs later I still laugh whenever I watch the movie.I especially love the part when tommy Goes Cow tipping w/ his new step brother.
5,Tommy Boy,"Brilliant Movie. I thought it was outstanding. Farley and Spade's best, genuinely funny, hilarious! This and Billy Madison are my 2 FAVORITE movies EVER! No joke! Buy it. Outstanding!------Scene from the movie:Richard-Oh, melted chocolate all over the carburator, that really ups the resale value. Tommy-I think we're gonna be ok here, Richard, it has a thin candy shell, I'm surprisd you didn't know that. Richard-I think your brain has a thick candy shell Tommy-You're brain has the..shell on it. Richard-are you talking? Tommy-Shut up RichardCLASSIC!"
4,Tommy boy,"Classic movie, received quicker than anticipated. Also included bonus video of never seen before footage. Defiantly worth purchasing if your a Chris Farley fan."
5,A classic everyone should experiance...,"This is going to be short, but this movie has brought joy to so many people thatks to Chris Farley. His humor changes people's lives. He makes people laugh and be happy. This movie is one of the all time greats. No one will ever be able to re-create a movie with even close to Tommy Boy's re-play value. Buy it."
4,Great introduction to Search Engine Optimization,"""Search Engine Visibility"" is a great introduction to the field of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It explains, in very easy to understand language, how search engines work and how you can build or modify your site so that it will be more ""friendly"" to them.However, if you already know a lot of SEO (such as paid subscribers to Danny Sullivan's SearchEngineWatch.com) and you're looking for expert tips, you will probably be disappointed. Shari Thurow has written a very good book, but it clearly is not meant for search engine marketers. Nevertheless, the book can be used as a reference to potential clients who would like to use unethical techniques.If you have never dealt with SEO, ""Search Engine Visibility"" is a must-read!"
5,Finally! An SEO Book That Doesn't Teach Tricks!,"Many people think that creating a Website that can be found in the search engines means you have to forfeit a great looking design. Others believe that search engine marketing is all about tricking the engines and fooling directory editors.Shari Thurow's 'Search Engine Visibility' explains in clear, concise language why this just isn't so!Today's Internet search engines and directories want to see the same thing as your site visitors -- a Website that clearly states what it has to offer. Shari's done a great job of putting her years of designing search engine friendly sites into words the average Webmaster will understand.Search engine marketing takes one giant leap forward with this book that spells out exactly what you should do (as well as what you shouldn't do) to achieve long-term Website success."
3,Only The Basics?,"I was happy to discover that this book DOES NOT actually tell you how to make ""Dynamic Web Pages"" search engine friendly. It mentions about this in general but doesn't give you the code or script you need to make it happen. There is already too much competition for top page ranking so I was relieved to know the secret on how to do this wasn't totally revealed in this book. I don't think the information contained in this book is any better than what you can learn from search engine optimization tutorials or forums easily found on the Web."
3,Good if you're building a new site,"Shari Thurow's ""Search Engine Visibility"" offers the basics of designing a search-engine-friendly website. It is a bit outdated, but does still provide lots of useful tips. It is quite readable and on the brief side. Ms. Thurow uses a sample organization, a Tea company, to illustrate her points.If you are building a website, you know nothing about SEO, and you want to be sure that you cover the SEO basics for your website, you might find this book helpful. However, if you already have an existing website and you want to improve your search engine visibility, and especially if you are looking for a book that will teach you all about SEO, this is not a good choice."
5,Excellent book for Webmasters,"This is an outstanding book! Very well written and very much based in reality. Shari Thurow really gives excellent advice on dealing with everything from Flash and CSS to directory submissions, and re-submissions. If you are looking for a book to help you with your search engine results, you need this book + Search Engine Optimization by Fredrick Marckini. The adivce you get from these books will have a significant effect on your search engine rankings."
4,You need this book,"A friend of mine recommended this book, and I am glad that he did. I have seen results in getting better search engine rankings on Google using the information in this book.It's VERY important to note that search engine rankings require a LOT of work. You're not going to get good results today and expect to stay up there tomorrow. Your site needs constant tweaking to stay near the top. But the information in this book will help you with that."
2,It doesn't teach tricks however it doesn't teach SEO either,"This book teaches some web site design, some usability, and some basic SEO. Author thinks that SEO is not about getting top rankings. So, how can you expect her to teach you SEO? Do not waste your time and money if you know some basic SEO which you can find free on the internet."
2,Clearly Dedicated To The Beginner,"This Book is clearly dedicated to the beginner to search engine optimization!! I read this book over the weekend and it was like a flash back of reading the original ""search engine visibility"" first edition. I'm not knocking this edition, simply stating this is not for the advance search engine optimizer.I was shocked that the book didn't dedicate anytime on how to best optimize multi country sites and the 2.0 buzz of the many social media tactics to capture additional organic traffic.I would say if you're new to SEO great buy the book, if you have any experience pass in the fast lane.Benjamin Burns"
5,I wish I could give it more stars!,"Easy to understand, concise, and the best advice you can get about Search Engine Optimization. This is the only resource you need to be successful in the search engines."
1,Would I bring this teacher an apple?,"The answer is NO. I bought this book because of good reviews and wasted my money. The teaching in this book is either lacking or the author assumes that you already know everything. So why write a book? What is missing is clarity! I waddle around in Oolong Tea coming out of my ears, but where are the precise steps I have to take to make my website visible? You know, like A, B, C, and D. This book is extremely hard to find a beacon to guide you through. I am a college graduate and I know a good teacher when I spot one. This book .... well, you will forever try to find a clue to become visible."
1,Web Sites,I would recommendthis book for anyone teaching a coarse in web site development or any one making a web site. I have made 3 web sites and they would have been better if I had read this book.
4,A fun little book!,"This is a small book with black and white images printed on ""special paper that allows the light to shine through."" Basically you color the pictures and hang them on a window. The book is about 4""x6"" and has 8 images - the Big Dipper, Saturn, Star, Group of Stars, Crescent Moon and Stars, Comet, Earth and the Sun."
1,I expected more,"This dover little activity book isn't as lovely as it could be. Extremely plain designs, and the only planets shown are Saturn and Earth. Half the pictures are of stars, and they're boring, plain. I could draw this just as good as they do, and I am no kind of an artist. Definitely not of the same quality as other stained glass coloring books."
4,Great DVD Set,"The set was great, my husband loved it!! He only wishes there had been face-to-face interviews with Bob Conrad, as well as the cast and crew, as opposed to an audio interview. It brought him back to his childhood and rekindled his love for the series."
5,Everything I expected,I purchased this for my husband who loves old t.v. shows. He was not disappointed at all with this. The shows were exactly as he remembered. The quality was excellent. I only ordered the first season but will be purchasing other seasons soon.
4,His reputation doesn't precede him?,"Creative episodes and bad guys, beautiful women, unruffled ""cool"" and how does he keep his outfit so perfect and unwrinkled? Great for unwinding at the end of the day."
1,The WILD WILD ....BAD,"The show was good in the 60s and 70's but it's boring to watch in this century. The settings look fake. The acting is so so. The show is in Black and White. I found most of the outdoor scenes looked exactly like they're filmed indoors. It's so boring that I did not finish watching disk 1 of this set.So far, there are only 3 western movies/shows that I like. They are Geronimo - An American Legend (1993), ""Quigley down under"" and ""The good, the bad and the ugly""."
1,Wild Wild West 1st season dvd's,The dvd's are fine but it was a gift and the first ones I ordered never arrived causing me to explain to my mother why she wasn't getting her birthday present on time. I may be reluctant to order from you again.
5,Loved this series as a child.,"Watched as a child. Still have the theme song on my iPod. I enjoy enjoying again the various "" night of the. . . "" plots and the evil characters like Loveless."
4,"Wild Wild West, Season 1","I was thrilled with the episodes and the introduction provided by Robert Conrad. I was happy with a lot of the extras that are included. My only problem is most of the extra's are audio only. I would have loved to see some bloopers or cut film. I realize that the show is 40 years old, but there must be some film that could be included as well as the audio interviews.I am grateful for the comments Robert Conrad made about Ross Martin and Michael Dunn. It is so nice to hear things about the two of them as people. I met Ross Martin once, he was the nicest man I have ever met, gracious and caring. I would want everyone who would buy these DVD's to know what a kind and wonderful person he was."
4,Another Good Classic Show!,"Always enjoyed this series growing up. It's ""James Bond of the West"". Really liked the addition of the commentary by Robert Conrad. Be sure to add to your collection!"
5,Totally Outstanding,There are not enough superlatives to describe this product. It was the best of the best. Simply outstanding. I was thrilled with it.
5,Quality presentation,"I've always loved the WWW and it was great to be able to purchase the complete season. The episodes are complete (to the best of my knowledge) and the reproduction quality is great. The ""additional"" features on the discs are OK, but basically filler stuff to give the hard-core fan as much as they could provide. It was nice to hear Robert Conrad recalling some memories from each episode. I am really hoping they release the secons season since the first was in B&W. The color episodes are what I remember when I used to watch this show as a kid. They were also more evolved than the first season and upped it a notch. The first season is still a must have for someone like me who gets a little nastolgic for those simpler days."
3,Not as good as I remember!,"The intervening years from when this was on television seem to have added an aspect of appreciation to my memory that has now been dispelled by seeing it on DVD. Certainly worthwhile as a western series, just not the equal to ""Rawhide"", as I falsely remembered it was! Quality is as we accepted in those days, but it has not been remastered as ""Rawhide"" or ""Hogan's Heroes"" which now look better than they did when broadcast originally. Not so bad as to be painful to watch, and worth 'buying a memory' at such a relatively cheap price, so long as you're not expecting too much: apparently I was!"
5,Wild Wild West 1st season review,"When I received the first season DVD I played it on my laptop computer. I was blown away by the clarity and the quality of the DVD. Considering that this was digitalized from 40 year old film I was amazed. I grew up watching The Wild Wild West in the 1960's and love Ross Martin's portrayal of Artemus Gordon. The world lost a great actor when he passed away but if he could see these DVD's I think he would say with a big smile ""James by boy, this is a great DVD."" And of course who could forgetRobert Conrad's Jim West. Now you can see all of those fight scenes in greater detail. I also have season two. The B&W; is great but the color episodes are fantastic. I can't wait for season 3 & 4. Katheryn, Ohio"
4,Good Shows,Wild Wild West is great family entertainment. We enjoyed the shows. My only wish is that they were in color like the other seasons.
1,Worse than a waste of money,The item I received was not as described. There is no wooden hoop and it did not come anywhere near fitting a queen size bed. It came stuffed in an envelope rather than adequate packaging. Do not buy this product!
4,beautiful product,I bought this canopy for my baby's crib. We have our baby in our master bedroom. It looks very beautiful. The material is very soft.
5,My 2 and 5 year old LOVE these!,We put these up today in the room that our 2 and 5 year olds share. My 5 year old wanted something like this for her birthday. They seem to be good quality and they are really big which I love! They each cover their entire twin bed with plenty of extra fabric. The pink color looks bold in the packaging but once you open up the tent it's a very sheer and soft color. Very pretty. They are perfect!
2,Sirve pero la calidad no es tan buena,Es útil pero no tiene la calidad de algunos de los mosquiteros que se fabrican con nylon o polipropileno. Los mosquiteros marca MARE hechos en Venezuela o los Tukeke de indonesia son mas resistentes. Para darle 5 estrellas debería estar hecho de nylon o ser mas fuerte. Pensé que era de mas calidad cuando lo compre
3,Canopy,This was a pretty good deal. The only complaint is that the color was not really burgundy but red.
5,Bed Mosquito Net,We are very pleased with our Casablanca Oasis Mosquito Net. It is large enough to comfortably cover a king size bed. What I love best is that the color and shape add elegance to our bedroom while keeping away the nasty mosquitos.
1,Not enough fabric!,"We ordered two nets from the same manufacturer (a white one and a pink one), but they are different in length and the amount of fabric. The pink net seems to have enough fabric to reach completely around my daughter's 4-post twin bed, with enough left over for the netting to cascade the floor, but the white net for my son's room seems to have much less fabric and does not touch the floor at all (they have the same type of bed). Don't understand why, but it is too late for a refund/exchange. We purchased it in March in anticipation of the mosquito-season, and just recently set it up with the oncoming warmer weather."
3,Great but not for a suitcase....,"We got the net for occasional trips to areas where we would need it. It is a very well made net but the wooden hoop is too large to fit into any reasonable sized suitcase. We realized it when the order showed up on a full-size bicycle box itself. If you do not need to pack it, it is a great net..."
4,Just what she wanted!,"This canopy was exactly as described and our little girl adores having it. It's been 7 months with no issues, though it is just hanging. Heh. Fits over her Full size bed with room to spare and makes her bed the Princess Bed she so very wanted.."
4,Pointy Knives and Happy Smiles,"I got this belt buckle a while ago, and adore wearing it. I feel special when I'm wearing two butcher knives around my waist. I'd say you should get it, however you need to be perpared for the little nobbin, the metal piece that you push through the hole, to slip out of most belt buckle holes. Easily remidied by creating a smaller hole yourself though."
4,A wild ride,"As a lifelong lover of a good children's book I found Measle and the Wrathmonk to be a fun read. It has a magic train set, a loveable hero and a giant cockroach! What more do u need? This book has a great plot full of high flying, if maybe a bit far-fetched adventures. My favorite character was Tinker. I just loved the way the writer showed us the world from a dog's pint of view by giving Tinker dialog that no one but the reader can understand. This is a well written book that moves the reader forward with compelling characters and exciting scenes. I did think the ending was a bit anticlimactic but I was able to overlook that fact after I found out that this is just the first book of a series."
3,Excellent group reading book,"In an ever-changing plot, with mysteries around every corner, Measle and the Wrathmonk leaves the reader feeling curious all the time. I used this book for a 5th grade reading group and we were able to create some discussion with it. It's not the easiest book to talk about because there are so many odd and unique things happening in it. They really enjoyed the humor of the characters, and were excited to hear it had many sequels. I would recommend this book to someone who likes the fantasy-world, has a big imagination, and will not be talking with others about it."
2,disappointment,"I love Tito, but this album doesn't have enough soul. I realize that these songs are more on the latin jazz than mambo side, but this stuff doesn't compare favorably to his better latin jazz work.Recording quality is good for a Tito CD, but I'd rather listen to ""12 Mambos & Take 5"" or ""El Rey"" anytime."
1,Custom Rod Thread Art,"I paid $37 for this book. It is probably worth $5. Simply stated, it is poorly written. As a part of how bad it is written is the fact that it does a terrible job of really explaining the process--exactly why I bought it. This author is on an ego trip about how important he is. I tossed the book to the back of my work area and continued to explore the process on my own in conjuntion with the other rod books I own."
2,very advanced,"This book is NOT for the average joe who wants to wrap one of his favorite rods with a custom butt wrap! If you are a novice in the field of rod wrapping this book will be a long way over your head, I know it was over mine. Mr. Clements and his buddies have worked out a list of the patterns and all of the names and sequence of each different wrap, then he assumes that you should already know all the terms he applies to the instructions. Also there are NO COLOR pictures in this book, the only color is used on the front and back covers and of course a color photo of Mr. Clements. All the drawings seem to be hand done and are in black and various shades of gray."
2,Needs further combining,"2 1/2If the ambitious metal group seems good at doing one thing, it is merely hinting at how uniquely compelling they might have been had the chemistry gelled more frequently."
4,Electronicat is underly appreciated!!,"Very excited about this guy! The beats are very movable; the bass beats are true to their own!! This music is very interesting and well-worth it's place in my collection. I very much appreciate the fast receipt of this disk in my mailbox, and the condition and price are reason to celebrate any way you look at it! Amazon was made for purchases such as these. I definately will be back doing business with this seller!"
2,Electronicat - 21st Century Toy,"I'm not sure what to make of 21ST CENTURY BOY, a strange mixture of electronic manipulation and glam rock. ""Tonight,"" for instance, has an urgency that could make Freddie Mercury jealous, though the twangy guitar might freak him out. The vocals on ""Frisco Bay"" aren't meant to convey anything meaningful, other than contribute some texture... though the banjo does plenty of that. But the electronic throb that seemingly infects every track grows tiresome very quickly. Even the acid line or the wah-wah guitar on ""Experience"" can quite eliminate it. The throb tends to flatten out the album as whole, making it sound oh-so-repetitive. Finally, when he slows down on ""Whenever You Want"" does some differentiation show. But ""Till I Die"" and ""Baby You"" kick it back in. Oh well, at least ""Giterkatze"" has some catchiness to it."
4,T. Rex goes electronic?!,"This album, above all else, makes me feel like dancing all over the place. And I'm no dancer. It has this constant, intense beat layered with glam and punk rock noises... Granted, not every single beat had me shaking on table tops, but I really enjoyed this album thoroughly. I highly recommend it, for what that's worth. I also recommend seeing him live if you can."
5,500 fingers of sheer fun....,"For any child over the age of 10 who is studying the piano and any adult who also did so ""The Five Thousand Fingers of Doctor T"" is a MUST.Funny, gentle, quirky it offers warm chuckles to people of all ages. A truly ""ensemble cast"" performance with, perhaps an extra Gold Medal for Hans Conreid in the title role. A Five Star, ""must see""."
2,Sour Note,"No wonder they didn't produce any other live action productions of Dr. Seuss books until after his death. This film gave me a headache. The direction and pacing of the film is flat, the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring(inexplicably nominated for an Oscar!), the acting was wooden, the sets were garish and ugly. At least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss works were. I think Dr. Seuss works best in small doses like the short animated TV shows that were made some thirty-odd years ago. Do check out the ""Gerald McBoing-Boing"" cartoon thats included on the disc. It contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than ""Dr. T"" does in ninety minutes."
1,Yeah Boyee!!!! When I saw this I just had get it BUT,"$85 freaking dollars!!! What the hell is wrong with Ecko!!! I mean of course the clock is rare and it is a great stroll down memory lane, but there is no way in hell that I am paying $85 dollars for some cheap plastic with a cheap speaker inside that is muffling Yo G! Yeah boy!Come'on, lets be honest after mass production this clock probaly cost them $5 dollars to manufacture, the licensing fees etc...we have $10-20 dollars tops!! For a clock that once I am done with my bachellor life I need to either give to my kids or store in the closet.I will wait until they do not know what to do with all those overpriced clock and finally lower down the price to a level that doesnt leave your posterior aching everytime you are going to sit down.Yeah boy!"
1,disappointed,I'm disappointed in this dish. It is extremely heavy and has no lip or handles to aid in carrying it.
5,Just get it!,"If you're tired of the legions of ""The Market is God"" ninnies who control the pulpits of every mass media outlet, you will LOVE this book. Hilarious, insightful, and occasionally, even profound."
4,not enough of these books around,"Fun stuff, if occasionally verging on a bit of a guilty pleasure. Presents a needed populist critique of bizcult that doesn't require a grad seminar in Foucalt (though nothing wrong with that). I can't get too worked up over some of the apparent failings of the book cited by some below (yes, can be somewhat repetitious, for instance), because overall the message is right-on. Just as we need more subtle ""serious"" critiques, so too do we need more straightahead salvos. Room enough for both and god knows we need them in this media-saturated corporate hive."
2,A bunch of white guys sitting around talking,"I actually agree with most of the analysis of culture, media, and business that Frank and his frat boys turn out but it doesn't change a thing as long as they are replicating the power structures they rail against by creating an in-club of overwhelmingly male hepcats."
5,One of the most influencial albums ever,I have always loved R.E.M. but this by far is thier best album. This album has and always will have a place in my heart. The song writing is amazing and the production is timeless. A real deep and emotional album that is dark but sweet from Drive to Find the River. A masterpiece that I feel is over looked.
5,"Best album of the decade,if not the best ever.","R.E.M. ,capture every emotion a human can experience ,in just one album.When you listen to the sullen sound and lyrics of ""Sweetness Follows"",to the shivering high of memories in ""night swimming"".this album has the ability to help the listener through the worst of time and to remind the listener in the best of time's ,that the presence sorrow is always there so enjoy life while you can.Automatic for the People has always been reviewed as a depressing album,but in my opinion this is one of the most up lifting pieces of music you can possibly listen to.From amazing strings to the shere haunting brilliance of Micheal Stipes vocals,this is definitly one for anybody's C.D. collection,weather an R.E.M. fan or not."
4,Amazing artistry,"Simply amazing music... the violins, keyboards and cello add a very soothing texture to Stipe's thoughtful lyrics. The band plays well together, especially on ""Try Not To Breathe"" and ""Drive"". ""Ignoreland"" is a good song here, but its political ranting makes it seem a better candidate for Document. This was the first R.E.M CD I bought and it got me hooked."
5,An American Classic,"Automatic For The People is a bittersweet record that will never leave your CD collection once it's yours. A sweetly beautiful collection of songs about life, death and perhaps even beyond, I can't recommend this album enough. It's one of the few CD's I own that can take me to the point of tears (but not quite).The songs on this record are not as cynical or politically-inspired as previous R.E.M. releases. The group have changed hats adeptly here and have gone for strings and melodies to accompany the melancholic lyrics.I forewarn you: this is an album no written review can do justice. The best review you'll ever stumble upon is the actual CD. It speaks for itself quite well.Simply beautiful."
4,Folksy.,"Now if we're lucky, maybe the kid below took will take Cobain's lead. It's a shame that young adults nowadays need a dead junkie's seal of approval before they can explore beautiful music like REM's Automatic for the People. Anyway... Onto me... ""Nightswimming"" is my favorite song. I've always loved it. ""Sidewinder"" and ""Drive"" have a nice folksy flavor to them. ""Man on the Moon"" is instantly memorable. Too bad REM's best songs are sprinkled across each of their albums. I guess great things can't all be found in the same place. Two other excellent songs from REM not found on this album or their wholly excellent Document are ""Driver 8"" and ""What's the Frequency"". Check our those songs, too."
3,okay,"I love ""Man on the Moon."" One problem with R.E.M. is that they don't vary their sound very much. Michael Stipe said he didn't like the Beatles, but he could take a lesson from them and vary the sounds R.E.M. makes (One of the great things about the Beatles is the variety of their music). And also, regarding Stipe saying the Beatles didn't influence him: whoever influenced Stipe was influenced by the Beatles, because R.E.M.'s whole sound is basically the Beatles doing their song ""Rain."" Listen to the Beatles ""Rain"" (done in 1966) and you'll hear R.E.M.'s sound, but BETTER than R.E.M. has ever sounded. Nonetheless, R.E.M.--and this album--is better than most crap out there."
3,"Good, but not Classic","I'll admit it. I liked R.E.M. better in the early days, when they were an inscrutable little alternative folk rock band. I liked them better when Stipe mumbled and Buck jangled. I just can't help it. I think this album has been critically overrated. Having said that, I like some of the songs here quite alot: ""Try Not to Breathe"", ""Sweetness Follows"", ""Find the River"". However, many of the tracks are weak. One of Stipe's most irritating vocal performances is captured on ""The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight"". The lyrics to the much bally-hooed ""Everybody Hurts"" strike me as less than profound. The somber tone of the album oppresses me."
4,Sadly Beautiful!!!,"I actually feel REM are over-rated,but the sweet & moody songs of AFTP are ""therapeutical"".So quiet! Introspective!!Makes you wonder what these guys were going thru when they wrote these songs."
2,Bad pressing....Boo!,"The poor review is for the bad pressing of this album, not the music itself. My copy sounded warped during Man on the Moon and Nightswimming, two great songs on this album. Returned it for a full refund. Do I dare buy it again and try my luck?"
2,Incredibly self-indulgent pretentious drabble.....,"...by a band in a serious state of decline. The only thing that saves it from a 1 star rating is ""Everybody Hurts"", which is a decent cut. Check out ""Document"" or ""Life's Rich Pageant"" if you want to see what these guys were once capable of."
3,"Not bad, but overrated","I don't mind this album - it does have some really good songs on it (Drive, Everybody Hurts, Nightswimming) but there is a lot of filler (e.g. Ignoreland, Monty Got a Raw Deal, etc). It doesn't stand up well when compared to the real R.E.M. masterpieces (Out of Time, Monster, New Adventures in HiFi). If you want to try out some R.E.M., I'd recommend one of the others before this one. It's good, but there is better."
2,Title says it all.,"The title speakes volumes about the amount of effort that REM put into this CD. I believe it was their attempt to prove that popularity (something REM has never enjoyed) alone would sell CDs. It is interesting to notice the large number of five star reviews from people that start with (to paraphrase) ""this was my first REM CD"" i.e. ""I did not listen until they were popular""."
3,REM with an Edge?,"I have always wished that REM had more of an edge, the lyrics are thought provoking, but my husband makes fun of them as being lulabys. I can't quite argue that either. This album, in my humble opinion seems to be the one that has more of an edge and as a result it the only REM album I have."
5,A quintessential album of American Rock!,"Is there anyone who cannot admit that this is one of the Best American Rock Albums of the 90s?... Just listen to the sad, slow rhythm and lyrics of ""Everybody Hurts""...!!!!Hey, this album is so damn good, that even the amazing Paul Potts decided to make a ""Classical"" version of this R.E.M. Hit, sung in Italian (""Ognuno Soffre"")!!!!... And even in this version, the song is still DAMN GOOD!!!Actually, I hardly could find bands that are able to produce music so fine, that even going thru such a change of musical style, and then having such a success!!!!"
1,THE MOST OVERRATED ALBUM OF THE 90'S,"NEEDLESS TO SAY FROM THE TITLE, I AM NOT A BIG REM FAN. BUT FROM WHAT I HEARD OF THIS ALBUM, IT'S THE SORT OF DRIVEL YOU COME TO EXPECT FROM GROUPS WHO ARE PREPARED TO RELEASE ANY TRIPE UNDER THE GUISE OF 'GRUNGE' MUSIC. IF I MENTION THE TRACK, 'STAR ME KITTEN' THAT SHOULD SETTLE ANY ARGUMENTS ABOUT MY COMMENTS IN MY FAVOUR. SORRY GUYS, BUT STICK TO PLAYING AT YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY HALLS AND LEAVE THE PROFESSIONAL WORK TO THOSE WHO CAN BE ORIGINAL ........(IN OTHER WORDS U2!)"
3,3 1/2 Stars,"Quite possibly R.E.M.'s most overrated offering. Although much better than the sell out ""Out Of Time"", Automatic is laden with strings and orchestrations...the group can no longer rock effectively, as tracks like ""Ignoreland"" and ""Sidewinder"" can attest to (they are clubfooted and clumsy). They are far more successful on the mid-tempo, jangle tracks...many of which were hits and nearly all became R.E.M. classics. There is great material here (""Find The River"" especially) and ""Nightswimming"" offers up one of the last Stipe scat-like poetic tracks that would be so sorely missed later on.Overall though, AFTP is a somber, slow paced disc that's far too adult in nature to be totally comfortable with."
3,"NOT flawless, but a very good record","I didn't realize the Backstreet Boys ""Millenium"" wasjust as good a record as ""Automatic"", but the cumulativeaverage stars prove it. I own all of R.E.M.'s albums, but I'm partial to their earlier records. However, the good stuff on this record is outstanding. ""Sweetness Follows"", ""Everybody Hurts"", ""Nightswimming"" and ""Find the River"" are all wonderful examples of the tenderness and insight this band is capable of. ""The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight"" and ""Ignoreland"" are just short of annoying. I don't overly applaud ""Drive"" since the signature line ""Hey, kids, rock and roll"" was borrowed from fellow Athens contemporaries Pylon. The catchy, hook-laden ""Man on the Moon"" proves Stipe and Co. can write a hit single with the best of them. I'D LIKE TO GIVE THIS ALBUM 3 1/2 STARS. This is definitely R.E.M.'s best record of the 90's. If you are new to the band(is that possible?), this album along with Murmer and Life's Rich Pageant would be fine introductions."
3,"REM Achieve A Nice, Clear Sound On ""People""","Well, this isn't one of the greatest albums of all time; in fact, it's probably only REM's 5th or 6th best CD. But it does sound good; there's no denying it's well crafted. It contains some of REM's worst music (the almost unlistenable ""Ignoreland"", ""Drive"" with its rip of David Essex's ""Rock On"") and some of its best - at least in the '90s - the fantastic ""Man On The Moon"" (currently being made into a movie starring Jim Carrey) and the infectious ""Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight"", patterned after the (often a capella) standard ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"". REM fans should definitely own this CD; others should opt for Murmur, Reckoning or one of the '80s compilations."
3,elliptical and eclectic,"Funny, but it was ""New Orleans Instrumental"" which compelled me to buy this disc, utterly unheard otherwise, while I was browsing my local music store. It remains my favorite cut from the album."
5,End of the line,"REM's ""Automatic For the People"" was not only the last great album by the band but also the best recording of the band's career. That is quite an achievement for a band that has had several great moments. Starting with the leadoff track ""Drive"" every track is at least good and several of the songs are classic. While this recording is a little more melancholy than their other output, it still carries several trademarks of the classic REM sound. And the last two tracks, which have never received any airplay are two of the most beautiful compositions they have ever recorded. It is really sad that REM deviated towards a grunge sound on their next recording and they have never seemed to regain their magic touch since."
4,An absolutely beautiful album,"R.E.M. have created a masterpiece with Automatic For the People. I believe it to be their best album and that is saying something when you look at their impressive catalog! All successful albums, in my opinion, must have an atmosphere that draws the whole album together. It cannot just have one massive hit single that blows the rest of the album away. This album is chock full of gems and not only are the lyrics beautiful but the music itself haunts you after you're done listening. A must have for any music collection. Key tracks are ""Drive, Man on the Moon"", ""Everybody Hurts"", and ""Nightswimming""."
4,a thoroughly great CD,"The most beautiful songs on this CD have got to be ""Drive,"" ""Everybody Hurts,"" ""Monty got a Raw Deal,"" ""Man on the Moon"" and ""Nightswimming"", although ""Ignoreland"" & ""Find the river"" are great too. Turn this on late at night...preferably by a pool...it's sooo nice..."
4,REM are just about worth the hype,"This is the first time i decided to pick an REM album up only hearing the extremely popular everybody hurts to be honest i didnt excpect this band to be all that good and i could not have been more wrong. My favourite tracks are find the river, everybody hurts, try not to breathe and the sidewinder sleeps tonite, it's an album thats full of great sounding acoustic guitar with a little electric to make this a great album from a good band. With this band being in the pop mainstream it's good to hear some well gathered musicianship that works well unlike most you hear in the mainstream."
5,One of the best albums to come out in the 1990's.,"This is an intoxicating folk rock recording. ""Drive"" and ""Everybody Hurts"" are mesmerizing pop tunes, and ""Try Not To Breathe"" uses its strong hooks to catch the listener. ""Man on the Moon"" has thoughtful lyrics. But the overall power of this recording comes from its steady electric guitar lines and lilting mandolins. This album has more of an edge than it's predecessor, OUT OF TIME. It is a must buy. Go get it. And you can usually find a used copy of this CD as well."
5,Automatically liked it!,"When my friend handed me this CD in college and said ""this is one of the best albums ever made"", I laughed and said ""O.K. I'll give it a listen"". That was 7 years ago and still remains one of my most treasured albums. I always liked REM because they offered a different sound than many other groups that are mistakingly placed in the same genre. REM created a genre of there own, way before they made this album, but Automatic for the People is their masterpiece by far. All the songs, music, Stipes voice, and lyrics are woven together to create a beautifully rich tappestry of events that have occured in each of our hearts and remain in our memories. Which is why replay value on this album is priceless."
5,This is Great!,"All songs on this CD are very good. Tracks 4 and 10 are especially good. The songs, Everybody Hurts"" and ""Man on the Moon"", are two beautiful and inpriing ballads. New Orleans Instrumental No.1 (track 5)and the Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight are just as good."
5,Michael comes back in our times with the reality of death,"If you wish to make the best, you'll never be able to make it. R.E.M. wanted to do a rock' n roll album but they did an acoustic one the best of their production ever Stipe speaks about death expecially in I'll try not to brathe and Man on the Moon, dedicated to Andy Kaufman. But the pearl in this album is for me Nightswimming, a perfect ""piano ride"" moduled by the exciting voice of Micheal Stipe, that reaches levels of passion that i have never seen before. A special mention for The sidewinder sleeps tonite, a mix of nonsenses that make brighter the capacity of R.E.M. ""I am going to make at least another record, and i wish it would be acoustic and deep like last R.E.M. work"" Kurt Cobain"
5,Ok computer and....,"this album are the most essential recordings of alt rock this decade.Even Nirvana's Nevermind, U2's Achtung Baby, Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation, or any very important album, even the ones last mentioned which are considered masterpieces, get to this music level, the level were both, Ok Computer and this album reach a level of sadness, density and real emotion played by all of both bands' formation. Just hear Man On The Moon with great happines and tears in you eyes, Drive to watch how your brain dopes itslef with impressive tunes, Everybody Huts to fell in love completely, or Ignorland to just freak out completely. An album reccomended for those real music lovers, which use music not only as art, but as a way of comlpete emotional excorsism. Wonderfull, REM from this album on, can compare to Radiohead....... the best bands ever..."
4,"Michael Stipe & Company Shift Gears , Dont stiff on Songs","I remember when this CD came out, I was 13 years old and very impressionable. It just gets better with time. The acoustic material is some of the best they've done. This is a wonderful record for the times you want to relax and take it easy. Top cuts are ""Drive"", ""Monty Got a Raw Deal"" , ""Man on the Moon"", and ""Find the River"". a great starter cd for those few who are new to R.E.M. Thanks for reading!"
4,Overall a very good cd,"This is an updated version of my original review from about 3 years ago, in which I described this as the best cd ever recorded. Since then my musical tastes have greatly expanded, and I can no longer give this album that kind of praise. However this remains an excellent recording, particularly in its emotional value - it's peaceful, relaxing, gentle and soulful. It has the ability, that I find more and more rarely anymore, to break down the barriers of space and time between the artist and the listener.Most importantly, Automatic for the People has that quality that is almost completely gone from the world of mainstream rock: It has a soul."
5,Husband loves it,I bought this for my husband and he was excited to own it in his collection. One of the best!
5,Unabashedly astute and insightful,"An unapologetically honest and - at times - dark peek into the truths that life cradles in it's sinewy arms. This disc never fails to make me look at my life through the dark, blurry lens of stark honesty. These songs rip me from my seat and i'm suddenly 19 again and in love with that girl again. The very one i pushed away so many times ... and i realize just how self absorbed i was.""Yeah, yeah we were all together lost in our little lives""""Distanced from one, deaf to the other""OK, so i realize how self absorbed i still am. Just ask Sunshine."
2,Be cautious buying the vinyl version,"This review applies to the LP (vinyl) album:$10 seemed like a decent deal for this classic on vinyl. When I opened the record up it looked like it had some scuff marks on it, as if it wasn't handled right when it was stored. I started playing it and it sounded fine. I'm no audiophile but it had a nice lush sound. When I flipped it over and got to Nightswimming, it had a weird echoey distortion, more in the piano than the vocals.Had to return it based on that. Great album, but buyer beware on the vinyl."
3,First real disappointment from a great band,"I rushed to the store to buy this when it came out only to find myself severley disappointed. The album has two of the greatest R.E.M. songs ever, Drive and Everybody hurts, but on the whole it sounds dull and labored. I found myself calling the album ""ordinary for the people."""
3,Automatic for REM's Fans,"The sales records for 1991's OUT OF TIME,has prompted REM to record and release AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE in 1992. This was not a big hit like OUT OF TIME but it brought the smash single MAN ON THE MOON,a tribute to the late Andy Kaufman. Again,REM cooled down with NEW ORLEANS INSTRUMENTAL NO. 1. The only other track that I know of that was a hit was NIGHTSWIMMING. Since this album wasn't a big hit,REM would wait until 1994 to release the follow-up,MONSTER."
2,some wonderful songs but a boring album...,"I'm a huge u2 fan but maybe I'm the only one on this world who doesn't like r.e.m. very much.I find songs like drive,everybody hurts and man on the moon(one of my favourite)very beautiful.But the other songs are boring and ripetitive.I don't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.I hope one day I'll understand this band..."
1,I don't get it,"I just don't get it. Virgin Records lists this as the seventh best album ever. I can't figure out why. When Man on the Moon came out I hated it, but I figured there was something else on the album that made up for it. There wasn't.I bought mine used, and at [the listed price], I think I got robbed. Nothing on here is particularly impressive. The ""emotion"" that is supposed to sell the song can be found in equal quality on a Backstreet Boys album, and they have catchier tunes.All in all, this is NOT the decade-defining album the producers try to sell it off as. Save your money, or better yet, take the money you would have spent on this album and bet your friends that the members of REM end up homeless within the span of five years."
5,R.E.M.'s best one!,"This is simply a classic! I have never ever met a person who has not fallen for this album. This is where R.E.M. shows its full strength, the climax of the band's musically genius development.Almost every single song is a hymn, an accomplished individual piece of music. One song more beautiful than the other. With peaks such as Find The River, Man On The Moon, Nightswimming and the great, great starter Drive.It is beautiful, it is multi-harmonic, it is music on a very, very high level!"
5,REM their finest album by a long way!,REM'S Automatic for the people is a must for any REM fan. It is by far their best album with such classic songs as 'Every-body Hurts' and 'Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite'. I would even go so far as to say it is probably the best album of all time.
1,Mystery Teapot,"This doesn't necessarily need to be printed, but the biggest problem I'm having with this teapot (I have not yet bought it) is that I have absolutely no idea what its capacity is! I wouldn't dream of buying it without that information."
4,Memorable Indeed,This book still lives in my memory although I read it years ago. The scenes it evoked recalled many memories of the years I spent in the South when I was a child.
5,Must-read memoir,"Stark, honest and moving autobiographical material from Maya's childhood and early adult years. She reveals how she got her name (Marguerite), but her brother couldn't say it so he said My...ah...(sister) but everyone started calling her Maya then. Her parents were basically absent losers and she was brought up by her poor grandmother in the south who ran a grocery store for black migrant workers. This is a brutally honest account of abuse by a step-father (her mother handled it beautifully - gained lots of respect), and racial discrimination, struggling to feel normal in a sub-normal environment. A very moving story and eye-opening for whitefolk. When Maya gets a toothache and needs a tooth pulled, but the ""whites only"" dentist won't pull the tooth, we are brought to rage inside toward the evil biased fool, and empathy and respect for the grandmother willing to go to the ends of the earth for her grandchild to take away the pain."
5,I love this book!,I first read this book in high school over 25 years ago and all I could remember about it was the rape scene. But I just finished reading it for the second time and realized what a great writer Maya Angelou is! She writes such beautiful descriptions of everyday life. Now I'll have to read all her other books!
3,50 words or less summary of theme,"This compelling story illustrates how we ""are"", for we do not live, but merely exist, in the eternal and unconquerable cages of society only to do what we can to survive in mind behind bars we can not break."
2,...,"Well, the beginning was terribly boring. I didn't understand much, either. But towards the end, it was an okay book. I have read better books, however."
2,The Life Lessons Could Have Been Written Better,"In any life one learns things of value which could be shared with others to help them understand our world. Maya Angelou obviously had many interesting experiences, but the manner in which she tells is, well, perverted. Sure she was raped and had a promiscuous sexual encounter. But, really, how is the explicit and graphic description going to help me? How will this perversion make me a better person? And the short response to that is: It won't."
2,No logro interesarme,"Esta obra me resulta increíblemente pesada y su lectura me pareció infructífera. La autora no logro interesarme en el tema familiar que trataba y creo que este libro esta muy por debajo de sus poemas, que son rítmicos y hermosos, llenos de vida. Quizás este un poco prejuiciado a leer biografías o autobiografías pero he leído unas cuantas mas o menos soportables. Creo que las personas interesadas en Maya Angelou deberían leer sus poesías y dejar a un lado este libro.Luis Mendez"
1,RACIST!!,"RACIST! Has anyone ever noticed that every time ""Black"" is written in the book it starts with an uppercase ""B"" and every time ""white"" is written in the book (with the exception of being at the start of a sentence) the ""w"" is lowercase??? What is the deal with that? She is supposed to be some great humanitarian and she is still to this day perpetuating a racist message. I understand she had a hard time growing up, but come on now. This book should have not been printed, and it sure should not be read in our schools as some great literary feat. She is a racist, that's the bottom line. Don't give her another dime."
