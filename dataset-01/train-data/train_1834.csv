2,Major design flaws - not for boys,"Thought the music would be a great ""reward"" for my son, however, he must have the techie gene because he figured out right away when he put his hand over the red light beam he could activate the music. Also, every time he sits to go, with the cup installed, it leaks all over the place. The only saving grace on this is that the seat can be removed and placed on a toilet."
1,Has Stopped Working,"We have had this potty probably 9 months now. When we first got it, it worked perfectly, music played when it was supposed to etc. Now as my 2 year old is getting more serious about potty training the music won't work when it is supposed to, it leaks on the floor even though the shield is in place and he has tucked himself. I took it apart, cleaned it, and reassembled, and it still leaks."
1,GREAT IDEA BUT LACKS COMFORTABILITY,"I bought this for my 16mth old daughter. I've been working on potty training her however the back of the seat is so small on space that her poor little butt sits half on the back of the seat and half over the seat. This is not only uncomfortable for her but it leaves her poor hind end red and raw because of the lack of space for her to sit on. The seat leaves much to be desired! Having said that, it's very easy to clean up and I like the fact that it not only has a back for her to lean against but it also has handles for her to hold on to."
5,My 3 year old boy loves it,"My son loves this chair and we have not had any problems with the sounds.... we just replaced the batteries when needed. We have a blues clues seat that we put on our ""big"" potty, but he likes this much better. It's less scary for him, especially for poopy time. Every kid potty trains differently and has their preferences, but this works well for us. The splash guard works fine (my guy is good at pointing down when he pees) and doesn't cause any discomfort."
1,LEAKS!!!!!!!!!,"This potty chair LEAKS VERY BADLY!!!!! Pee gets on the floor EVERY stinkin' time AND on my son's feet. The opening is WAY to small to go number 2 in. It is very messy business to clean up afterwards. I am VERY disappointed with it. Buy this ONLY if you want to waste your money. Plus, the sensors for the music are WAY to sensitive and go off when no one is even in the room! Ugh. :("
2,Waste of Time and money,"My 21 month old daughter sits on the Royal Potty like it is a chair but refuses to use it as a ""potty."" The music only plays when you move the potty from place to place, and once when she did actually ""go"" in the potty, there was no music. The small book that comes with the potty falls apart very quickly. Fisher-Price usually makes good quality products. Unfortunately, they really bombed with this one. This potty got the royal flush from our house...it will be sold in our garage sale."
2,Not good for a boy!,"I bought this for my 2yr old son based on bells and whistles without researching it first. That was a big mistake. The whole thing is kind of small, the splash guard is totally ineffective, and it cuts into his thighs. The worst thing is that he pees right over it (and on it) almost every time. It comes out easily, so he likes to take it off and throw it YUCK! Words can not describe my frustration! Also, he has learned that if he rocks back it activates the music. When he goes back forward he pinches his ""stuff"" in the splash guard. If you have a little boy, please consider a potty with a better better splash guard(deflector)."
3,A Great Toilet Seat Potty,My parents bought this seat for my two year old. He wouldn't sit on the thing while the legs were on but loves it on the toilet. He always removes the cup in the front and to see how tight it fits when he is seated I can't blame him. It was worth the money just for the toilet seat and book but be warned. Once your child discovers how to trigger the music you will fight to keep their hands out of the toilet. If you ask me I could have bought a nice toilet seat without the extras for a bit less. But then again they sure love that music.
1,Horrible!,"It leaks like crazy and the seat opening itself is too small. The splash guard is way too small and doesn't work very well either. I am throwing this away and going shopping for a new potty chair. Every time my child goes potty, no matter which way I sit him, the thing leaks and there ends up being a big puddle underneath. He doesn't like his feet getting wet, and I don't like having a puddle to contend with in the mornings when I am trying to run out the door for work! It is very unsanitary in my opinion and they need to take it off the market!"
4,Finally no leaks!,"After going through a couple pottys that left me with messes on the floor due to their leaks, I finally found one that doesn't leak! My almost 3-yr old son will sit on it and go potty and he loves to ""make the music"". The instant reward (hearing the music) is perfect and very motivating for him. I love it that I can actually hear when he goes and don't have to wonder if he's gone or not while he's still sitting. He has even figured out how to put the bowl and splash guard back on himself after I clean them. The only thing is after a month of use, the song doesn't play every single time he goes potty. Not sure if the sensor is out of alignment or what, but it plays most of the time. The chair seems comfortable and has nice arm rests and a back to it. He loves to read the book that comes with it, but we never get past the first couple pages because he's going potty and we're celebrating! We still have a ways to go, but I think we're finally on the right track with this potty."
4,Potty is no fun.,"I really don't think of this as a toy. Our kids are slightly amused with the potty idea, but lets face it -- not always an enjoyable experience. It seem comfortable for our three little girls ranging from 1-3. Easy to clean and sturdy as well. The potty ""detector"" and music thing rarely works. And occasionally it comes on in the middle of the night with no one in the bathroom. But the kids do love the book that comes with it. But there are much better potty books in the book store. Nonetheless I'd buy it again from among the choices out there."
2,A ROYAL PAIN!!!!!!,"The only positive thing I can say about this potty is that I never had a problem with it leaking. Of course...my daughter only ever used it two times. Reason number one is that it was VERY uncomfortable for her. Because there is no padding on the seat, after sitting for just a few minutes (which as you know is a part of potty training), her bottom would have a red mark from the seat cutout and she wanted to get off. At first I thought she just wasn't ready for potty training. Then...I bought another potty with a padded seat (because I was SO annoyed by the super sensetive ""music"" that played every time except when it was supposed to!) and she sat fine and is potty training great now. This potty was not worth the money. A rare fisher price mistake."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought this potty seat for my son thinking it looked great and fisher-price ALMOST ALWAYS makes great things, but I was wrong with this one. First of all, the music plays only when the chair is moved...it hardly plays when my son goes potty on it. Secondly, I would NOT recommed this seat for a boy. The ""protector"" is there for decoration only, at least that's what it seems to me...and let's not even talk about the book that was easily torn apart by a 15 month old...I should have bought the potty chair that can also be used as a stool, at least I could have got some use out of that..."
2,Double Your Clean-Up,"I bought this seat because of the musical reward. My daughter was 18 mos. old at the time and got a kick out of the music, although she didn't start using the seat until she was 26 mos. old. By then the batteries had died so the music was not a factor in her use of the potty. The big problem with the seat is that, unless she sits all the way back and completely straight, we have a bigger puddle on the floor than in the seat! I am buying a different seat for her as I am tired of the double clean-up."
1,Disappointed,"I choice this potty chair because of the music playing feature. My 18 month old loves music, so I figured this would be a great reward for ""going"". First of all, I should have looked at the ""function"" of the potty before looking at the extras. The bowl is very small and the guard for boys is pretty much useless. My son is average size, but barely fit on on the bowl. His little legs kept getting pinched between the guard and the sides. I guess it was a $.. learning experience and I will know what to look for now."
1,HATE IT!! Leaks all over the floor.,We got it as a gift for Christmas. Just started using it with my son who is 27 months. I don't know if it's because he's a boy but for some reason it leaks all over the floor. The urine comes out of the front between the bowl and the potty seat. Aweful!!!!!
2,A Cute but leaky potty!!!,"I got this potty as a shower gift. The concept is cute. My 2 year old liked the sound effects when he sat, and went. However, it leaks every time he urinates!!! And frankly I am tired of cleaning up pee, so its extra work! They need to perfect the design. I know two other peple with the same potty and they have the same complaint. It works best when you attach it to the regular toilet. In my opinion do not buy this product, if you get it as a gift hopefully you get a gift reciept!"
2,Potty is Pointless,"This potty is pretty pointless. If the music would work correctly, then that would be a really good reward system. The music starts everytime my daughter moves, while she is sitting on the potty. I would just buy a plain potty over this one, if I had to do it again."
1,Leaks all the time,My 18 mo old son started using the potty almost naturally but everytime he would go pee it would leak. The design of the splash guard is poor because you see the gap between that and the bowl. The guard seems to pinch his legs (average sized child) and the potty seemed a bit small. Wish I had read all the reviews on this one before I bought it.
1,Horrible! Don't buy this,"From cars to paperclips and everything in between, this is the absolute worst product I have ever purchased. It leaks 95% of the time around where the bowl meets the potty. I did more cleaning up than anything with this potty. Unless you want to be on your hands and knees cleaning up puddles all day, do not purchase this potty. A true disappointment from Fisher Price."
1,The worst potty ever!!!,This was the worst potty ever. I bought it for my 2 year old son cause it looked different & it looked like it would be more fun but its the worst. Everytime he pees it leakes!!! I ended up getting a new one cause I thought there was something wrong with it but the new one also leakes. Plus the music is the worst. Every time you walk near the bathroom it goes off & the stupid red light stayes on which means the batteries keep dying. I thought Fisher Price was a good company?
1,"GREAT FOR PLAYING, NOT FOR POTTY TRAINING","I couldnt get my son past trying to make the light go on and the music play, which is WAY too easy. There should be an on off switch, a bigger seat and a much less sensitive mechanism to trigger the music. It is also way too difficult to detach the seat from the legs in order to use the seat on an adult toilet bowl."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I purchased this product under the assumption that it was the top of the line model. Unfortunately, my 2 year old son ended up paying for my mistake. We had a very difficult time just trying to fit him on it. Because he is big for his age, 41 lbs. at his 2 yr. visit, it was almost impossible for him to get comfortable on it, and when I finally got him on, I couln't get him back off without causing some level of discomfort. Also, did I mention the fact that this model was most likely designed for little girls!! After 2 long days, we called it quits and moved on to another model."
1,dont waste the money,I bought this potty chair because it looked different and i thought it would help but its just annoying more than anything. the music goes off when you walk past it or even when the cat does. and when my daughter sits on it it doesnt play music until she figits around and then it goes off every time she figits. theres a little red light to that completely distracts her cause all she wants to do is stick her finger on it and make noise. and the thing that holds the potty comes out extra easy. i would return it if i coul
4,Sound advice from an expert.,"Dr Goldenberg takes a controversial and complex subject often innundated with old wives tales and gives it a sound medical basis. His own dealings with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue as well as chronic pain has made this author sensitive to the needs of the person diagnosed with this condition. It is really a must read for anyone with chronic pain and depression. Dr Goldenberg doesn't speak condescendingly. As one of the named ""best doctors in America"" and Head of Rheumatolgy at the Newton Hospital in Massachusetts, his knowledge and expertise and the thousands of patients in his care with these disorders, makes this book absolutely imperative for sufferers."
1,Too personal,"I believe that this book was written with good intentions, however, I think the book was focused too much on his personal experiences. That would be fine if you wanted a comparison, but anyone with FMS, like myself, knows that each individual case is different. I felt as though I was reading a combination of a second grade book report, (with too many little side comments like this) and a medical report. I would prefer something in between. The effort was there, that is about all. It was just too much of a diary format to be extraordinarily helpful. (And I am a patient of Dr. Goldenberg) He is the one who diagnosed me."
3,Grocery store background music,"I like the Christophori's Dream cd, some of whose tunes are here. I was generally disappointed with the other tracks, finding them bland and uninspiring. The tempo for most of the tunes is slow, making them drag. I was surprised that a collection such as this would have perhaps only two tracks I like, other than the one's I already had."
5,Excellent Resource,"Wonderful! These 2 DVDs allow you to watch 3 performances and listen to commentaries on them afterwards. These commentaries help you to understand the meanings of the movements in the dances. There is even older footage of Appalacian Spring which is compared to the newer version which I found interesting. I was particularly interested in Martha Graham's techniques, and there is some filming of some of those with her voice narrating and explaining them. It is a treat to hear her speak. For people interested in the filming aspect of the performances and others at that time period, it is neat to hear what Nathan Kroll has to say on that subject."
4,Fun for Granddaughter,"All three Barbie type dolls were given to my granddaughter for her 7th birthday, and she began to play with them immediately and still does. She has more Barbie dolls and continues to play with all of them. They all appear to be in good condition. I believe I made a good choice."
4,Useful Information but not pricing...,"The Redbook is a great reference for coin collecting. It has color pictures of almost every coin. It also illustrates die varities and other rare errors like double dies. The pictures are enlarged so you can see if your coins have a feature that makes them much more valuable. It tells you the mintage for each coin. Also, with each coin series there is a short history about the coin series. Included is a section about error coins.The one bad thing is the pricing. It really is not much inline. If you want this book just for pricing I would not reccommend it. However, if you want it as a reference, I would highly reccommend it. Some prices are too high, and others too low. So if you want a good coin reference book, this is one of the best out there!"
4,Italy's Frank Sinatra in the 21st Century!,"I had a chance to listen to this at work - my secretary brought it in. Big deal, I thought.....WOW! Pat g (g is for Girondi, according to the credits) mixes up unusual lyrics with a Brooklyn Swagger and fluent Italian, to come up with a fresh approach to original music. If you can find the CD, BUY IT - I'm going to check his web site - I don't want to wait 4-6 weeks to get this - I highly recommend it!JH"
4,A DJ's view,"I love this album. I first became aware of this artist through his song Preinvasion Jitters. I saw this CD on the rack at the radio station where I work and wondered how it slipped through my fingers. After giving it a listen, I decided it was by far one of the best new albums. it has a certian hillbilly flair and ellance that is reminicant of Woody Gunthrie, Pete Seiger, and Stephan Smith."
4,"Great CD, stick to the quick songs","Dondero is really great on this cd. Several of the quicker songs (Ashes on the Highway, See It Clear, The Living and the Dead) are some of the best I have heard all year. The music mostly consists of Dondero on guitar and Craig D on drums, and this simple setup really works great. The songs follow the life of a travelling/touring transient. I really like the way Dondero puts feeling into his singing.If you like this, check out: Jon Brion 'meaningless' White Stripes 'Elephant' NOFX 'Heavy Pettin Zoo' & 'Punk in Drublic' Cat Power 'He War'"
4,The Amazing Dorsey Saga,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well researched and well written book, as I did the two previous efforts by this writer on Harry James and Nelson Riddle. It is a fascinating account of the life and times of the big touring bands in the swing era. I found it very hard to put down but sorry when I finished it. A very fine piece of work in my opinion."
4,Great!!!,Better than I thought. The Reader is very small and easy to use. Protects my micro sd card while carrying it on my key chain. Blue Proton has very fast delivery. No complaints yet...
4,2 gigs are sweet.,Great value for a 2 gig microSD card and a reader.Only problem is the reader's flimsy line which makes in non-suitablefor attaching your reader to your keys.Card however works beautifully with my t629 phone.
1,usb micro converter brooke over a week.,Usb micro adapter brook over like a week. Should watch out. Other SD and micro card is fine.
3,"works well, but USB connector doesn't",the memory card works as advertised. i bought it for my cell phone and it's great. however the USB connector does not work. that is why i rated it below a 5 star. other then that it's fine.
4,Great Legal Eagal,"Such a great help. I recently purchased the ""Quicken Lawyer 2002, and must admit for the price I paid I was extremely dissapointed. Broderdunds Family Lawyer is ""outstanding"". Whether you need to create a will, a living trust, child-care agreement, trusts, health, education, real estates, selling your car etc, this is the software you need. I have recently made a lot of personal transactions requiring legal documentation and am happy to say this software has saved my family lots of $$$. It was easy to use, easy to understand, and saved us a ton of money. It can use some very minor improvements, (not worth mentioning) but it's well worth the investment."
1,Simply terrible,"I see people comparing Family Lawyer and Quicken Lawyer and get the feeling that Broderbund is doing a bit of ""negative marketing"" against Quicken.I've used both, and Quicken Lawyer far and away exceeded Family Lawyer. Family Lawyer doesn't catch mistakes, isn't up to date and provides several useless forms (like ""Personal Fact Sheet"" and ""Letter to School""). Also, information is sparse and generic, often giving me a form and not showing how to use it.As a do-it-yourself guy, I picked up Family Lawyer and almost gave up because every time I took documents to my attorney to review, he found dozens of mistakes. Only once I started using Quicken did those mistakes disappear. Thanks Quicken!"
1,This program is a waste of time and money,"I wish I could return this software and get a refund! Having just gone through a divorce and trying to keep my business afloat, I figured I could skip my lawyer and do my own revised estate plan. So I went ahead, filled out estate-planning documents and took it to my lawyer for what was suppossed to be an hour's review. Turns out the forms had a lot of legal errors which made them pretty useless. I still can't afford an attorney so I'm trying out the alternatives next."
1,The description of this item is Misleading,"The ad Amazon.com printed for this item includes ""real estate"" in the description of the forms included. However, according to the box description, there are only trivial worksheets and rental forms included. No real estate sales forms, no buyer offer form, no forms for seller disclosure, lead paint disclosure, or other standard real estate forms. I can't vouch for the rest of the program cuz I returned it unopened when the box arrived. To me, it was worthless."
5,Love it!!!!,"I love this thing. It looks beautiful and perfect. The metal is strong. It comes with 2 types of mounting brackets with screws and instructions. I put mine under my window, so I didn't need the brackets. It fit perfect."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting this to have the clear lid, but it in fact did not. I should have realized this since ""Greenhouse"" is no where in the title. But hopefully this will prevent someone else from making that same assumption."
1,Beware... Item will not last,Worked for maybe 3 months... Save your $. I'll be looking for a more reliable brand and tossing this in the garbage.
1,Zoo Med ReptiTherm,"Am not very happy with these two products I purchased. I placed the Zoo Med ReptiTherm under tank heater and did not even last 1 month, then the second one lasted a week and it was ice cold. My reptiles and I were very unhappy. BOO! I emailed the seller and by golly I haven't heard one word. That's to bad, because earlier I ordered a minidome and had to return to because it was also non functional."
1,Don't buy,"I purchased this product and about a month later, it wasn't working. I purchased another, and it is not working. Fortunately, customer service has responded to my complaint quickly. However, they will not refund my money, but claim they will send me another new one. I guess I'll just keep faxing them a receipt every time and get a new one. Terrible quality."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this product to heat my hedgehog's cage. It had excellent reviews on several sites and was highly recommended by hedgehog breeders. However, after getting mine, I removed the paper backing to stick it to the side of his cage, and it refused to stick at all. Although it heated up just fine, it was useless as it would not stick to the cage. Very disappointed with this product"
2,Short lifespan,"Like other reviewers, I experienced a short lifespan on this product. It lasted a little over six months, then failed while I was at work, letting the temperature drop dangerously low."
1,TRULY HATE THIS HEATER,"THIS IS MY FOURTH HEATER IN A LITTLE OVER A YEAR. WORKS FINE FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN EVEN THOUGH PLACED AS IT SHOULD BE, TANK RAISED SO AS NOT TO SIT ON CORD, IT STARTS TO UNSTICK & BUBBLE UP. TRIED HOLDING IT ON WITH DUCT TAPE AS SUGGESTED BY PET STORE, STILL DOESN'T STICK. I HAVE OWNED SNAKES FOR OVER 30 YEARS, AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH TROUBLE WITH A HEATING ELEMENT. I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE."
3,Really should give more warning,I bought this thinking i could use it for my roach tote. Sadly it does not go on plastic so i bought it and wasted my money on this item thinking i could use it with plastic cause i did not see a warning.
5,Heat Pad Size to Tank Ratios,"For all those who are looking at this product and are confused about which size should be used for which tank:The large is 18""x8"", meant for 50-60 gallon tanks.The medium is 8""x12"" meant for 30-40 gallon tanks.The small is 6""x8"" meant for 10-20 gallon tanks, and the mini is meant for up to 5 gallons.Hope that helps.As for the product, I've never had a problem with the Zoomed heat pads. Just remember to use a thermoSTAT at all times when using one of these products as they can reach dangerously high temperatures when unregulated."
1,Fire Hazard,"I wouldn't even give it one star. I got it in January for a 50 gallon tank. It was applied correctly, raised the right amount. Worked great for keeping the correct temperatures for my corn snake.Tonight I was cleaning her tank and noticed a spider web crack on the bottom over this pad. When I moved the tank out to get a good look at the pad, there was a glowing ember smoking at me! (No the heating pad was not damaged in any other way. The tank was not moved, the cords were not moved, no lightening, etc)Now I have to get a new tank and heater (different brand for sure!) It is only October (a mere 10 months later) and if I had not cleaned the tank when I did that little ember would have smoldered until my two toddlers and I were running from a house fire, not to mention the danger to my poor snake and her neighbor (my husband's ball python)."
2,"Worked great, but only lasted 2 months.","worked as advertised. I did receive a larger size than expected as another reviewer mentioned, it is indeed 18x7. The reason for 2 stars is it just stopped working out of the blue after just 2 months and 2 days."
3,"Good enough, but could be better","We purchased this to add a little additional warmth to our tokay gecko tank. It worked wonderfully, except was almost impossible to get all the air bubbles out. I have a lot of experience in applying films and removing bubbles, and this was very difficult to do given the thickness of the product. The heat transfer was decent enough even with several remaining bubbles, but our terrarium has extra-thick glass so this definitely wouldn't have been enough without the lamp above him as well. The tokay did especially like the side of the aquarium I stuck this to though, and would ""hang out"" on that glass side for days."
5,Great product,Just recieved heat mat and it is the same model that is sold at my local pet store for 70.00 i am more then thrilled with the product
5,Zoo MEd Repti Therm Under Tank heater (UTH) 50 gallon,"I use these for my 40 gallon Breeder glass tank for reptiles requiring belly heat. It has perfect uniform heat BUT, you must use a quality thermostat in conjunction with this UTH. With a good thermostat and this UTH your reptiles will be extremely happy.Bill"
5,The Most Trusted News Show,"I get my news from Stewart (and Colbert). Horrifying to some, but no one gives a more balanced account of the news that these two. Their coverage of the 2004 presidential election (DNC & RNC to Election Night) is first class."
5,Awesome,Do I need to say anymore.....it is the Daily Show on DVD.....Great DVD. I just wish they would put all of them on DVD.
1,Comes Wack on an old school Track,"Obviously bogged down with liberal bias... even if it follows puppets making crank calls. I'd suggest watching Tucker Carlson's show on MSNBC, or reading National Review. Daily show campaign coverage does have commentary to the left, and they hide behind the ""humor."" In short, the discs fake the funk!"
1,Out of the Arena,"Yeah, yeah.... Daddy government isn't perfect; so the ""kids"" hang in the play room and slam it for laughs... outside it all, and ""above it all."" But when ""Daddy"" comes in the room (for an interview), little Jonny is more polite. He doesn't call Sharpton on his Chinese meal rhetoric (an hour later you forget it all).... And Joe Biden -- the top Democrat of the Senate Foreign Relations Committeee -- gets a pass; absolved of the Mess O' Potamia.... The Daily show campaign coverage is like sarcastic nerf-commentary from the lunch room wings, aimed at the cool table.... And the ig'nant sidelined viewers are emboldened for... an ""above it all"" passivity.The Daily Show campaign coverage *is* better than real news, like Baywatch is better than lifeguarding -- it's more sassy fun! Do yourself a favor and keep it real by following real politics (reading!) Then come up with your own ironies and comedy... instead of the cheap jabs from the cheap seats."
5,Hidden Treasure,"If you felt Marc Almond was one step left of genious with his solo LPs, then check this out. There is actually another Mambas LP i remember seeing back in 84, but it is forever alluding my search. This is classic Almond with a spanish twist. memories of youth."
5,great product,I own the small and medium sized one. Have never had a problem with them. I mount mine on the outside bottom of the enclosure. I have them for my corns and my redtail will soon be useing them on all of my custom bluit enclosures cornsnakes love to burrow never once burnt them. When mounting it as directions stat like i do does not get hot enough to burn a reptile. I also have a water dish on top of one of mine and the enclosure hasn't craked. You can hold your hand on these things for hours and all they get is warm. Do recommend have tempeture and humidity gauges so it can be monitored at all times like a responsible bet owner should be doing anyways.
1,FIRE HAZARD! MELTS ITSELF!,"Bought the medium heat mat. Installed it on the bottom of my herps tank. The tank does not rest on anything and actually is held up for display by the sides so there is nothing to pinch or inhibit the heat mat. At first it started acting weird and would get super hot or barely hot at all. Then it got so hot it melted and destroyed itself. This was a little over 1 month of using it. Ordered product 7/18/12, received heat mat 7/20/12, started using 7/24/12, return policy is only until 8/20/12, first week of 9/2012 it melts itself. When it destroyed itself by becoming so hot it melted itself it was plugged directly into the wall outlet and secure to the bottom of the tank without any inhibiting factors like being pinched or such. Went to the reptile shop near my work and they said this was common and the only type of ""mat"" they reccomend is the film strip mats aka Flex Watt Heat Tape or Ultratherm."
1,Gets too hot!,"The base of my housing reads 154 degrees F. With 4 layers of newspaper, it's still reading 100 degrees. This is still an issue, since snakes like to bury under their substrate for use as a hide. Such high temperatures will no doubt burn (possibly kill) my snake if I put him in there. I've since read that the larger Zoo Med heating pads get way too hot. I should have purchased a smaller version, and so should you if possible."
2,broken after after 6 months,"Obviously nothing lasts forever. But surely it should last at least a year? It works fine, but make sure you have a substrate to protect your critter from burns. My corn snake did not get any, luckily. I am now using a regular human heating pad with a timer to turn it off at night.Also, after about two months the pad no longer stuck to the glass. I had to prop it with cardboard and wood."
2,Great at first....but then fell off,I have had this heater on the bottom of a 40 gallon breeder tank for approx. 9 months. It worked great at first. But I noticed today that the heater is coming loose and falling off the bottom of the tank. Interestingly enough the glue is still stuck to the tank. It is the heating pad that has let loose.
3,Useful but be Careful,"I suggest you be very careful with this product or any of the zoo-med heaters. The heater will need to be set on a timer and --Cannot-- be on all the time or it Will get too hot for your reptiles. When you first set it up I recommend you checking every fifteen minutes or so to see how hot it is. If its too warm and uncomfortable for you then it could burn your reptile.I didn't check at first and apparently it got Too hot, the underbelly of my King Snake is burned and I am treating it now. The under tank heater is on for an hour max now, the lights have been changed to create a warmer spot without the zoo-med heater on all the time. I will say my baby is healing up quite nicely and I seem to have fixed to problem. Still, you should be very careful, especially if your snake likes to burrow as much as mine."
3,1/2 Right,"The product was just as described, New and nevre used. One of the heaters was placed on the aquarium only to get super hot and then burned out. All instructions were followed, and this has never been an issue before with this brand. It was unfortunate, and I simply had to go to local pet shop (an hour away) and purchase a new one with which I have had no problems with."
2,"Disappointing: weak,no thermostat, and broke","You would think that what is basically a heating pad would be one of the most reliable devices possible. Ours broke in a few months. Even when it worked it had the major drawback of having no temperature sensor. It just always heats, no matter how hot the tank. I guess this could work for some where the room temperature is constant the the equalibrium reached between heat added and heat lost results in precisely the temperature you want. But that seems to me very unlikely for most. The wattage is not really enough to work well even with a separate (and likely expensive) thermostat. And as I say, mine broke relatively quickly. I'm still not sure how that is even possible in a heating coil with no moving parts. Overall I'd say this is an unsatisfactory and certainly overpriced product."
4,Great for my Gecko,"I purchased this with some trepidation. It says that it doesn't need anything else. My crested gecko's ground it about 2"" of soil and I have live plants in the terrarium, so putting it under the tank was pretty much useless. However, when I put it on the side of the tank is has enough heat going into the tank that it keep the tank about 70 degrees. Never gets so hot that I can't touch it easily with my hands and not even worry about the heat. Good product so far."
2,Stopped working two months later... twice.,"This is the second heater I have purchased of this type, from this manufacturer, and sadly, it only lasted about two months. I even made sure the cords weren't crimped, plugged into any suspicious outlets, etc. I just noticed my snakes acting strange and lethargic and lo and behold, their hidey place was as cold as the room I had them in :("
5,So far so good...,"Arrived quickly, set up perfectly for my tank, snakes lovin life! No problems with not sticking, don't know what everybody's complaining about."
4,Good and Toasty,"This is a great item to have for your reptilian friends! It is very efficient and is easy to install. Just take it out of the box, peel, and stick it on to your critters cage. Of course look at the directions for the best place to stick the heat pad first.Only thing that I noticed about this product is that if it is continuously plugged and unplugged it shorts out the pad. I've learned that through experience, so the best thing is just to keep it plugged in. If you are worried that your critter is getting to hot just spray him/her with some cool water. (And usually the critter is smart enough to move away from the heater if it's a really hot summer day)All in all a good product, and way better priced on here then at pet stores."
2,Gets too hot,Bought this for my sons corn snake. It is too hot to put it on the bottom of the tank. Was going to send it back and ran out of time. Now we just use it on the side. Will buy something different before winter with a thermometer that can be set on a temp. And manage itself.
2,Did not heat,"I had to stick this to the side of our tank, and it doesn't heat the tank at all. Very disappointed."
1,Broke in less than a month,I bought this item a few weeks ago and only have been using it for 2-3 weeks tops. I used it correctly as an under the tank heater and one day it just decided to stop working.
5,A new way of seeing the world around us,"When I first read this book, I realized that I was wrong about my own self. My perception was completely pointing to an opposite direction and I could not understand my way of reacting. Dr. Herrmann helped me to pipoint where I am, how do I react, and this makes me a better person."
2,Too Simple,Details in the the explaination & implication as a Sales & Marketing is too simple as a Sales Person.
2,Happy Holiday Music,tho this had a couple of gems on it I can't say the entire collection was delightful there are only a couple of things here that I will be playing again -
3,Middle of the Road at Best,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Christmas music but this one was a snooze. It doesn't even come close to the Ultra Lounge Christmas series (which I wish they'd make more of!). This one works if you've got several CDs on shuffle but alone it's a snore."
2,Price was too good to be true,"These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself. I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid's sized, but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing. The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight, and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically. The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads...except that they are even tighter than the knee pads; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off...I'll probably never use the elbow pads again. The knee pads at least do an ""okay"" job at protecting my knees (so long as they stay on) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents. I'll never be buying these again, nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children....(in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them.)"
2,disapointed,The product came quickly but the problem is that one knee pad is damaged and I'll return it. The saying that you get what you pay it's true this time.
5,i bought these cause thye looked cool,i bought these cause they looked cool. 'm 22 missed the fact that they were for kids but lets hope they fit lol. Just bought a 160 dollar mountain bike off my moms long time friends so hope i didn't get screwed oer on either.
3,Too big for my average 3 year old,"My brother ordered these for my son to go with the scooter he got for his 3rd birthday. They're too big for him, he's literally right in the middle range for a 3 year old in height and weight. The elbow pads would have probably worked on his knees but that defeats the purpose of having the set so exchanging them for something that will be more likely to work as a set."
3,Not as popular as the skates,"The rating isn't ment to degrade the product. They are very needed when using the inline skates, just don't have the WOW factor"
2,"Ok, Not great","These are only Ok. Look elsewhere if you are looking for really good ones. I was sold on the ""gel"" part, but that neither seem to offer extra comfort nor additional protection compared to a well padded gear. The straps are too big for my child and too small for me. It appears that these are made for either a small adult, a big child or an average sized adolescent. The straps on this are poorly designed. Straps on protective pads are usually made to turn around on a ring before getting strapped with velcro. These do not do that and just go straight. Velcro is not long enough to support a decent range of sizes. So, I will use it because I bought them, but would not recommend or buy them again."
2,The straps length are totally off,"I was excited when these came to my door; however, when I tried them on, I've realized that one side is very tight when the other side was alright. I took them off for a measurement, and realized that two straps on the knee pad are off by MORE THAN 2 INCHES!!!!! I am not sure if any other buyer has this problem, but I was shocked. Will definitely return them."
2,"Goods pads, bad sizing.","These are VERY comfortable, the gel really works, but if you're over 9 years old they probably won't fit.I'm 6'1"" 180 pounds, athletic, and they didn't fit. My 14 year old brother is probably 5'7"" 150, they didn't fit him. My 11 year old brother is um, small right now, and they BARELY fit him.These look nice, feel nice, but just won't fit you."
5,Great.,"Excellent protection for my daughter. She's 5 1/2 and these will fit her for years. I think the price was god as well. The only downside is that I needed wrist guards (for rollerskating) as well, and they cost @ $20+ by themselves. IF you need wrist guards it's a MUCH better deal to buy them with a set, but the sets I saw seemed to be of lower quality."
4,Great value & protection,"My 2 boys (4 and 7 years old) are learning to ride their skateboards and they asked for knee pads. These were the least expensive ones by a name I recognized, so I decided to order them.Despite my boys being drastically different sizes, the pads stay on and don't seem to impede their movements (they say). It looks a little funny to see my 4 y.o. outfitted like a goalie in ice hockey with his knees almost touching, but he doesn't seem to notice.Comfortable and standing up to the ramps so far."
5,pads,"My 5 yr old son takes some hard spills off his bmx bike and skateboard. He had some smaller less protective pads that he burned through. I found these online, read alot of the reviews and happy we got them. They are a little big but he will have that much longer use out of them and they still fit good enough for the protection he needs. He loves them and likes that when he falls he ""can't feel it"" I'm guessing because of the gel coating which absorbs the impacts. I am very happy with these and suggest them to every person who has a wild child in their life."
1,be warned. these are for children,"Ive been trying to get more active and so I've picked back up skateboarding and ordered these pads at the same time as i put in my order for my board. So of course, having one and not the other now I'm highly disappointed. Im 32. There is nothing on the description i found that said these were for little kids. My 13 year old nephew couldn't even use these. The strap will barely go around my knee at all and I'm not big at all, I'm wiry. Not only are they tiny but they look like they are made cheap. I know they aren't the most expensive pads in the world but after you put down money for shipping they aren't exactly free either. I love shopping online because it takes away the headache of dealing with busy stores but I'm not taking another chance with safety equipment. I'm getting mine from the store so i can see what I'm getting."
5,good protection,These should provide good protection for the elbows and knees which are the most susceptible to injury in roller blading down the streets.
2,too small,"the image does not reflect the smaLL size of the pads. I gave them to my kids, as it`s not even close to a large pad."
4,For my toddler,"My son is 25months old and is 25th percentile weight, 75th percentile height. Overall, the set is too big for him, but is still very useable. I like the fact that they don't have any cutesy characters on them, or are brightly colored. Right now i'm using the elbow pads for his knees. However, i can get the knee pads to fit if i criss-cross the straps behind, though they're a bit bulky. Fit is also better when he's wearing pants."
5,Great price for great pads,"Bought these for my son when he was learning to use roller blades. They are comfortable and can fit many sizes. I wouldn't get them for kids under 50lbs because they can only get so small, and i think at 50lbs these wouldn't sag and you could get them to fit snug enough. These would be too big for my 4yo who is only 35 lbs. My son says they're comfy and overall we're very happy with this purchase."
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality, but you get what you pay for, they were cheap. The orange pieces popped out when slightly pushed on (I ended up gluing them back in).I'd spend a little more money and get a good pair. I used these for myself when roller blading with my daughter and went out and bought her a better pair of knee and elbow pads that came with wrist guards. Oh, and definitely a helmet for both of us!"
4,Good protective pads,"Having gone through 2 other sets of protective gear for kids, I was looking for something more durable that could withstand falls. These have proven to be effective safety gear with more cushioning than other types of pads. They are easy for kids to put on and off and they offer good protection. They have been pretty durable so far including the straps which sometimes have the tendency to get overstretched. Definitely worth considering if you haven't had luck with other protective pads."
5,Knee/ Elbow pads,These are wonderful knee and elbow pads. my son wears there when rooler skating and has found a new confidence. He knows if he falls it won't hurt and he loves these!Definitely would recomend to others.
4,Pretty Good,"I bought these at Wal-Mart for $9.99. My 5 yr old is skinny & active, these fit him well & he doesn't complain about them ""itching"" him. I think it was a good buy."
4,No padding protection beyond the hard caps.,I gave this a 4 star because the hard caps are larger than average pads out there but I took off a star because there's absolutely no padding beyond the hard caps when other pads out there have thick padding that extend beyond the hard caps. These pads are too small to fit over clothing. There good for shorts and t-shirts. Also good for wearing underneath clothing. I wore the knee pads under my snowboarding pants and they where hardly noticeable.
3,not good,"I bought thinking it would be a good buy. This product does not fit well. they take a long time to put on and off.I am not happy with this product at all. My advise,do not buy"
4,Elbow pads too small,"Elbow pads were too small for a grown person. FOr a kid, 10, 12, 14 maybe OK. So I used the knee pads for elbow and had some work knee pads."
5,Good,"Bought it for my 7 yrs old. Solid, easy to use, no slipping so far. It looks cool, she doesnot dislike it though black isnot her favorite color. Would be better if there are choices of colors.Bought another set for 9 yrs old. If it comes with hand guards, it will be perfect."
5,Bought to go with Rollerblades,I purchsed these for my 9 year old son to go with his new Rollerblades and they are great. They fit perfect. Are easy to put on. Comfortable and well made.Don't hesitate. They are great.
2,Very low build quality,I bought this from Amazon. The image on the web is good but the actual product is below expectation in term of building quality.
4,A lost gem uncovered...,"To be honest, Fafa de Belem is one of the blandest Brazilian pop stars imaginable, yet her 1976 debut album, made in the wake of the psychedelic tropicalia boom, may come as a revelation to listeners more familiar with her many horrible subsequent romantic pop albums. Here, there's a wide stylistic range, and practically all is it is earthier and more engaging than almost anything she's done since. Her debts to samba queen Clara Nunes and MPB diva Maria Bethania are particularly striking, as are the numerous songs bouyed by heavy Afro-Brazilian percussion. Up until discovering this album, I'd never heard a Fafa record worth hanging onto; now I just scratch my head and wonder what went wrong."
4,Excellent Customer Service,I purchased one of these humidifers a little over one year ago. The unit quit working and I checked everything and it appeared to be the main drive motor as all the lights and relay switches were working. I sent an email to them describing my problem hoping to get help fixing my unit as it was well used. I received a reply within one day and a complete new unit within one week. I have four of their ceiling fans and would recommend this company.
2,Disappointing Performance,"Whwn I bought this humidifier I thought it had many good features and therefore would far exceed the performance of small humidifiers I previously used. However, it does very little to raise the humidity level in my bed room. In fact, I can't notice any improvement over what I was getting from my old humidifier.Another problem I have had with this humidifier is that I have had trouble getting it to start after it has stopped due to the water running out. I fill it with water and turn it on but nothing happens - it doesn't start. My wife said just hit it a few times with your hand. I tried that and got it to start. That is what I have had to do each time thereafter under the same circumstances. Based on my experience, I would not recommend this humidifier for purchase by others."
3,Handle came off water tank,We have had three of these humidifiers and have always been satisfied with them. My husband had filled up the 3-1/2 gal tank in the sink and was lifting it out by the handle to carry it to the base. The handle came off and it crashed to the kitchen floor just missing his foot. This is a unit that is 5 yrs old and we expected some wear. We never expected the handle to have been just GLUED on. Just be aware if you buy one. Maybe they have changed that design on the handle and have secured it some other way. Good luck.
2,Self destructs,"After using for less than a month on low I tried the high setting and it sprayed water all over the place, including itself and destroyed the control and display. I am now researching the humidifier products once again. I am starting to get the opinion that there are no good ones on the market for under $300."
4,Easy to maintain and economical,"I have had two of these units for about four years, one just went out and it was the one I let my father use 24/7 for at least one year. I love the large reservoir, the only downside is noise. The noise it makes compared to my air-o-swiss 7135 is night and day. This unit is much easier to maintain and good for use as a whole house unit, but not so good for the bedroom. I can see my current unit needing to be replaced within a year or so, and getting five years of life out of it for the money I paid makes this a great deal. I have never replaced a single part. I soak the filter element in bleach water and rinse when needed and some years that was only once when winter season is over and it is no longer needed until the next winter. I intend on buying another unit by next winter."
1,Too loud!!!,"This unit seemed ok for a while. It's gotten so loud that we turn it off just to be able to think. My husband tried to fix the motor and it was quiet for a few hours, but is now back to making a very loud noise as if something is loose in the motor. I'm looking at buying a new one!"
1,disappointment,"We bought 2 of these hunter humidifeis last year and they worked fine, but each of them has some kind of problem this winter. We've cleaned them, we've run soft water through thme ....and the light comes on, but neither of them functions this winter.So we're concluding that these humidifiers are disposable - for one season only...now we have to go humidifier shopping again - and it won't be Hunter this time.Jacqueline ComitoDalton, Ohio"
1,Unusable after 2 years: motor became very loud,"Mine worked fine for about two years, and then the fan motor became EXTREMELY noisy, emitting a loud click (not unlike a baseball card in the spokes of a bicycle wheel) with seemingly every rotation of the fan blade. I disassembled the plastic housing and removed the fan blade to ensure that no contact between major parts was occurring. The motor continued to make the sound, showing that the issue was inside the sealed motor itself, meaning that the unit had become effectively unusable. This was very disappointing. It was fine when it worked, but I don't expect such poor reliability from products costing more than $50."
4,"Okay,so far?",this has been a good machine so far.The motor appears to be a little noisy so I will have to wait and see what the life is.I have usually got two seasons running pretty constantly.Haven't asked about a replacement as mentioned in the warranty but I might if this one only lasts one season or less.
2,Edit: way too hard to clean and keep clean,"Edited: After almost a year of use, I have to say that we're getting rid of this humidifier because it is impossible to keep clean. The water tank is no problem, but the base and housing are a constant struggle. Every humidifier we've tried has needed to be cleaned quit ofter, but this one uses a pump system on the inside of the housing that is impossible to clean. We've tried everything."
4,Very Please so far.,"This is our second Hunter Humidifier, initially we bought one about 4-5 years ago, I droppedthe tank this year on our basement floor and it cracked so we chose to replace the unit. Thenew unit is almost exactly the same except it has it's own humidistat and a night light. Iperfer to use our stand-alone humidistat that came with our first unit.I like the easy fill tank and reuseable filter, but you should replace it after two or years.I didn't but we were going to have to replace the first one this year, it really gets filledup with deposits. Haven't found anything yet that cleans it to new condition.I highly recommend this humidifier, The new one is only 30 days old but because our housegets very dry it runs non-stop and so far so good."
2,New model is worse than the older one,"This is my second Hunter humidifier.First one was analog similar to that new digital one. It is still working.New model worked fine for one winter season- humidifying the large room.Water tank is big and very convenient to fill - we were happy and humidified!On the second season - humidity meter stopped working normally, then after two weeks unit developed ticking noise getting very loud.I am en engineer and humidifier is not a rocket science.After removing a few screws it became obvious that motor ""rubs"" and propeller shaft connects to the water pump through rubber tube that ages and apparently stops keeping its position, so shaft slides developing the rub of the pump propeller against the housing. Sadly omission.This is a design issue, and I may assume that now not only the manufacture is made in China, but the design too.My next model will be ultrasonic - I am tired on noise."
3,Hunter Fan Company,"Hunter is renowned for making quality ceiling fans yet the fan in this unit has failed 2 times for us. We purchased this model locally ($$89) last winter when our daughter was born and it worked fine. When we got it out to set up for this winter the fan buzzed and wouldn't turn. We returned it for exchange and have been using the replacement for a month. Already the fan is off balance and noisy, so much that it awakens you from deep sleep. I am disappointed in this product as this manufacturer makes great durable ceiling fans. I'll steer clear of their humidifier products in the future even though this may be an uncommon occurrence. Otherwise, the features are great and the humidification is effective. The no-filter-replacement aspect of this product is why we purchased this unit in particular and it appears to work well."
1,Very Unreliable,"Returned two Hunter 3.5 gallon humidifies within 30 days. The Humistate on the first one would not read properly, always showed low humidity. The second was loud and noisy with a bad vibration. The third one lasted 4 months before the fan motor froze up and quit working. Customer service at Hunter Corporation was very unhelpfull. Very disapointed in product as the previous Hunter Humidifier lasted 6 years with no problem"
2,PLEASE READ THIS,"I am trying to use this thing for a second season, the filter keeps going bad (even though I'm on city water and I have a softener) This humidifier can't operate properly in a tiny bedroom simply because the air going out is only around 50% humid (according to my honeywell meter sitting on this unit), add to that your furnace kickin in every now and than and blowing a lot more dry air than this unit is producing!So it is sitting in a small bedroom, it runs non stop (it is not cycling because it is not bringing the humidity up) and it struggles to bring the humidity above 40% (even though it runs non stop)the humidity meter is also not reading correctly....not recommended"
2,Humidistat malfunction,"I read lots of reviews and settled on this model. I like white noise at night so those complaints didn't bother me. When it came, I plugged it in and everything worked well. When I unplugged it to refill the resevoir, the humidistat switched from reading the actual humidity to registering either 'HI' or 'LO'. The unit won't run if it says 'HI'. I emailed Hunter and they said this couldn't be fixed and to return the unit. So I did. The replacement came and, after 30 minutes, the humidistat switched to 'HI' and the unit no longer runs. The first time, I thought it was just a bad unit. The second time, it looks like a manufacturing defect. I called the service desk and they advised me to try a third one. I'm thinking no..."
2,After 1 season the motor is trashed,"This humidifier barely lasted one season for us. The fan motor has seized up and it can't be lubricated. It's too bad because the unit didn't get too dirty and the permawick was still in good shape. It was very loud though. Save your money, buy the cheapest unit you can find and throw it away after a year. I won't even get into how much we spent on an air-o-swiss model only to throw that out two years later as well.... sigh."
2,Worked well but not for long,"This unit did work well, was quiet and effective but it only lasted one season. For the money they charge I would expect to get at least a few years of service."
3,Good machine; bad himidistat,"This machine does a more than adequate job of himidifying the air in my home but the humidistat either arrived broken or broke chortly after I started using it. In any case, the machine will not automatically regulate itself as it's supposed to do. I have to check the himidity levels with another device and manually turn it on and off. Hunter says to return the machine to Amazon for a replacement and Amazon says I need the original packaging, which I no longer have. Not the best return policies around but at least the machine does its basic job."
4,Satisfied with product,"Overall I am satisfied with humidifier. Easy to handle, fill & clean. Comforting to know I will not have purchase filters. Claims to do 1600 sq feet which is the area I am trying to put humidity into but it never shuts off no matter how low I set the humidity selector."
4,another hunter,I've had this humidifier before and wanted to buy it again after the first one died a natural death. It works fine except the first one I ordered had a crack in the tank I didn't see and I had water all over my carpet. Amazon picked up the defective humidifier and had a replacement for me overnight. They provided good service but I think they should have agreed to have my carpet cleaned. It was a mess. I have a smaller Hunter humidifier in my bedroom and am happy with the brand.
1,THIS THING IS A PILE,"THIS THING IS A PILE! SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN BUY SOMETHING MADE IN CHINA. Got it yesterday,and I'm shipping it back ASAP. Started making strange noises on it's first use after about 2 hours. Then every 15-20 minutes it would repeat the noise. Had to get up in the middle of the night and turn it off.Hunter 34357 3-1/2-Gallon CareFree Plus Humidifier with PermaWick Filter"
1,Awful: Ineffective and Broke after Minimal Use,"I used this product in my mountain cabin, where it is very dry. After using it about 12 days over a period of 6 months, it developed a loud swirling sound. Then, after 12 months (used it only about 25 times), it malfunctioned and dripped water all over my upstairs, creating a stain the carpet and downstairs ceiling.To make matters worse, it was never able to really keep up with the dryness. Although it was in a small bedroom, the humidity level never rose more than 3 - 5% (e.g., if it started at 20%, it might reach 25% if I was lucky).Put simply, this product does not last and does not work in very dry climates."
1,Disappointed-as others say-disposable,"Mine worked one winter, I cleaned it and packed it in plastic & put it in the linen closet. I took it out because dry Santa Ana winds are here and it WILL NOT TURN ON. Dead. I am not an engineer and don't feel like replacing parts that may not work. I would say DON'T BUY! ...and yes I tried all the settings."
4,This is my second one,"I had my first one for several years. We use ours in our bedroom and we only have it on during the night. We use tap water when we refill and we have a water softener. When it is on, it is on low which is quieter. The only cleaning it gets is a periodic, 6 months maybe, scrubbing. The filter is bathed in warm soapy water and I crush the sediment out of the fiber. We have the second one for two years. I need another one for another room which will be our third.On the low setting Hunter could improve the noise a little buy installing a better motor. This is why my rating is 4 stars."
3,Great.....when it worked! Save the box.,"This unit performed great for the first season. Second season, it worked for 1 month and died. Called Cust. service...very understanding, and eager to help. They said that this was a reoccurring issue, that i should pack it up and send it back for replacement. A brand new unit (not refurbished) arrived within 10 days. the new unit ran extremely well for 2 seasons then the float stuck, but a quick fix by me with some underwater marine grease that I had on hand.I always cleaned the unit every other fill up, used the specified additives and always completely cleaned and dried before off season storage.I just plugged it in for the 5th season....but it's dead! Tried noumerous things to get it working, but it just won't work. It's past the warranty, so no help there. Good thing I have a boat....'cause now I have a new anchor.For a $100.00+/- unit, I feel that it unit should last longer then 2 years.Great unit when it worked, but save the box for frequent returns."
1,"First unit came broken, second unit worked for 20 minutes. Sent both back.",We had a previous Hunter humidifier and wanted to get the same model. There seems to be a problem with the sensor that registers humidity as higher than it actually is so then units shuts off.
1,Much too loud,"I bought this humidifier, which at first appeared to be just what I wanted. However, after running it for a couple of hours it started to become very LOUD (a kind of rattling sound) even on the LOW setting. On HIGH it sounded like a truck revving up. I thought that it was just a defective unit, and returned it for a replacement. Same problem. So it looks as though the loudness of this unit is a built-in ""feature"". I couldn't even watch/hear my TV when it was running on low.If you can't stand noise, this unit is not for you. I just returned the replacement unit and asked for a refund.If it weren't for the noise level it would be an ideal unit for me. I was very disappointed."
2,Poor Quality,Bought this unit over a year ago. It worked fine for about a year. Then started rattling. I had to return the first one after a week because the fan split where the motor shaft went into it. The next one sent worked great. After a year it began to rattle. After disassembly I found the motor bushings had worn out causing the unit to rattle loudly. Just poor quality parts. The unit worked great for a year then had to be replaced.
3,Hit or miss is what this humidifer is,1st one lasted over 2 years and I gave it away. The 2nd one last only one winter season. The 3rd lasted 3 months. I am not happy. From what I have been told by people that sell humidifiers the Hunter is the best and none of them should be considered lifelong units. If they last a year or 2 be happy. If they don't then they don't. I have bought a 4th one now and hopefully it will be as good as my 1st one. If it was not a necessity I would not put my money on a humidifier at all but without one I have problems. In summary it is what it is and don't expect miracles.
2,Piece of Junk - Didn't last 1 winter,"We bought this filter in 2010 since we hated paying so much for replacing filters ever few weeks. The permanent filter started to come apart after about 2 months. I set the filter to turn on when the humidity reached below a certain level but ultimately the device would show an ""error"" message for the humidity and this functionality stopped working."
1,Not as good as previous model,I have a prior model of this same humidifier and have used it for 7 years without any issues. I purchased this in January to go in my sons room and it stopped working over the weekend so we got 4 months of use. I called Hunter and after sitting on hold for an extended period of time the customer service rep came on and was very snippy with me. She then informed me that she could not do anything without the serial number which I didn't have at the time (I was at work and the humidifier was at home). She said to call back when I have the serial number. Hoping I get a nicer rep when I do call back and really hoping that they resolve this issue quickly.
1,Hunter Humidifer is Junk,"I own this humidifer. The problems are: Water is able to reach so many parts that then promote the growth of mold and bacteria and hard water deposits. These areas are not able to be cleaned throughly and therefore this humidifier is hazardous to your health. The permanent filter is metal and gets covered with scale and cannot be cleaned with vinegar or other cleaner solvents. The reason the units don't work the following summer is they corrode and rust and also get the scale deposits over the moving parts which then freeze up and don't move. Therefore, the ""float"" switch doesn't know there is water available and it won't turn on. The fan motor is extremely cheap in design and this results in excessive noise, even on low setting. Overall, if you want to buy an unhealthy, poorly designed product that won't last, this is for you."
2,Confused,It appears sometimes confusing to me as to when it will go on. When I open the door to the bedroom it goes on. Shut the door and it goes off. Which I can live with. The main problem is the white powder. If I knew the amount of white powder it gave off I would never have gotten it. The white powder ends up in my mouth like a coating that gets solid. I recommend it only for a large room or rooms.
1,Garbage,"I'm on my second one. The first started making a noise,so I contacted the company. They sent me postage to send it back,and they sent me a replacement.Now the second one has the same noise,and they want me to pay the postage. Besides that they said I never sent the other one back.These people need to get a system. I'm not sending this back since they want me to pay the postage. I'm just hoping it doesn't start a fire or something. The noise is on and off.I will never buy another Hunter product.It's not a good product. Save your money."
1,Engineering nightmare,"This isn't worth the time it took to order it, and I'll be returning it for a refund.Unit is poorly designed. It's heavy and awkward to handle and operate. You have to use your thumb to push the switch forward and hold it down at the same time to keep it running, and this is extremely uncomfortable. I had a difficult time trying to do this and keep it running, and I was only testing it. It would be a nightmare to try to actually slice a roast or turkey and try to keep it running too.This design definitely missed the boat. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,its not worth it,"I purchased my knife over four years ago and have not used it since.I even forgot I bought it ,until my son gave me a bread maker for christmas and I thought it would come in handy to slice my bread.But that was a let down.I have learned to look at reviews before i buy anything else.So please do not waste your money."
4,Very useful for robotics,"This book was recommended to me as a starting point to both review and learn advanced mathematics useful for robotics scientists and engineers. It covers linear differential equations, algebras (including Lie algebra), and metric spaces.I found the text reasonable readable, and would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their understanding of the mathematical fundamentals useful for robotics and control research."
5,Under the Waterfall,"It has only been a year that I've come to know of her music. Since then, I sincerely beleive her music comes from the heart and pray to hear more of her inspired words of God."
4,Six String Heaven,"This is a great album. It probably won't convert the non-believers out there, but for fans of Hot Tuna and this type of music, it is a wonderful showcase. The jams are expansive but never 'too much' and the vocals and song selection are outstanding. Being a live album, there is a bit more spontinaity and looseness than a studio album, which adds to the enjoyment. Put it on and kick back and enjoy!"
4,Great Tuna,Brought me back to the days after Jerry passed away and the Furthur tours had just started...all the family members were touring and celebrating what was and what would eventually be. Jorma comes through and gives us a great sampling of where Hot Tuna was at that point in time....Great CD and it still amazes me when I receive these purchases just a few days after I have ordered it! Keep up the good work Amazon....peaceout
5,One of many we purchased.,All the Junie B books are awesome. They are so cute to read and my daughter delights in reading how much trouble one little girl can get into.
4,Junie B. Jones First Grader at Last,"JUNIE B JONES FIRST GRADER AT LAST is very fun; the author of this book is Barbara Park. This book is about junie B Jones WHO IS going to first grade and she has a journal were she writes all ABOUT her life. But going to first grade probably means getting use to a whole new teacher and ALL new classmates.Junie b Jones has her best friend called grace and a teacher called Mr. Scary. But when one day Junie B couldn't read the board and the teacher, Mr. Scary, changed Junie to a spot near the board, SHE still couldn't read like other kids.Would it be possible that Junie could end up using glasses?My favorite part was when Mrs. Weller GAVE the exam to Junie because she was acting very funny. I liked the part were she said, ""Recess is a lovely person, too.""I liked this book because it had a lot of details and I liked how she writes in her journal BAD, and then she fixES it. I recommend this book for people who like funny stories!"
2,Different than the kindergarten stories.....,"I'm 10, and I just finished: Junie B., First Grader (at Last!) and it wasn't the best. Junie B. may have improved on how she talked, but I didn't like the way she acted. She acted sort of like a snob, like when her mom talked about how glasses can be like a window, put them on--POOF!--and the world's crystal clear. All Junie B. said was: *Poof yourself.* I thought that was mean. I would have gotten more than a time-out if I said that. ***Junie B. also needs to have writing skills like a First Grader. Her journal writings look like a 12-year-old's. The book was nice, but I think Junie B. needs to learn to act a bit more polite and needs to learn to act a bit more like the Junie B. I've learned to love."
2,Suitability,"I ordered a few of the Junie B. books for my granddaughter, as she is entering first grade in the fall. She is now reading chapter books and I knew these were popular with the young set.However, my husband and I were a little distressed at the disrespectful attitude that June B. shows to her teachers and her peers. We do not think this type of behavior should be encouraged and will be looking for other books that reflect our values."
3,At Last,"Junie B. Jones is one of the most popular series in my fourth grade classroom. (Second only to Harry Potter.) Although this book is not as exciting or funny as Junie B. Jones Smells Something Fishy, I think it is a good beginning for Junie's ""first grade adventure."" Many children can relate with Junie B's fears, dissapointments, and struggles to make new friends. As always Park writes with humor."
1,"Geeze, Junie, What Happened to You??","I've read all of the Junie B. Jones books and this one was the worst. Why? Because Junie acts (now that the series tells of her life in first grade) like she's a forth-grader, and her journal entrees are too good for a 6-year-old. I didn't laugh either. Suddenly, Junie B. needs glasses. There wasn't enough to this book; another three chapters would have been better. And even worse: Junie B. is turning into a boss, show-off, I-am-better-than-you-and-I-get-what-I-want kid. Quite a change, huh? Go ahead, read it. Read ALL the first-graders. And THEN you'll see what I mean....A Kid's Review from Latrobe, P.A."
1,Not so good,Where is the old Junie B.? The spunky little kid who used to make my brothers and I crack up? The girl who always ends up in trouble? She's gone. She's not funny as a first grader. She's not a trouble-maker. Her journal entries are better than a third grader's. Her spelling is great...but that's sort of a bad thing for being 6. Junie B. doesn't even LOOK like the Junie B. we've come to know and love. She's different. And she'll never be the same. I loved the kindergarten stories. They're so realistic. But what are the odds that---not 1---but 2 and both of your friends will turn you down? That's not very normal. I'm 10 and have friends that I've carried with me since first grade. But Junie B. lost Lucille and Grace in a matter of days. I doubt a kid could lose both friends. Then they must not have been very good friends. I'm not reading the first graders AT ALL!!!!!!!!
4,Cute book for beginning readers,"This is a very cute book for kids who are just beginning to learn to read. It is a bit challenging and gives them the satisfaction of reading a ""big kids'"" book. My granddaughter is enjoying it now and will enjoy it for several years, I'm sure."
2,Not as good as other Junie B. Jones books,"This book was a big disappointment for this huge Junie B. Jones fan. Junie matured too quickly and lost much of her kindergarten spunk. I expected Junie to be more mature, but she seems way too grown up for a first grader. I taught first grade for many years and the new Junie just does not measure up. I hope Barbara Parks brings back the Junie that we all love. **Junie also needs skills on level with real 6 year olds. Six year olds cannot write journal entrees anything like Junie does. Junie's entrees look like they came from a 10 year old."
1,Will never buy a Junie B. book again,I'd never heard of the Junie B. books and came across them while looking for books for my daughter who was about to enter first grade. After the first few chapters I was ready to trash the book but we pressed on a bit more until the character became just unbearably annoying. My daughters were bored and never got into the story. Junie B. is a spoiled brat who doesn't come across as endearing at all.
4,Book Reveiw,I love this book I did a book report on it. But I can't give it all five stars.I think if a little kid read it it would make them think that you can act like her.But I have to present my book report in two days. I lovethis book though!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Proxxon,"I bought an extra set of these collets because that is the only way to use the profesional model, which was purchased through Amazon. I also managed to purchase a reconditioned FBS 115/E which comes with a chuck that fits all sizes. When the company gets around to making a chuck for the pro model, I hope it will fit the existing units."
5,...100 microliters of goodness...,"The title of an album rarely describes how it sounds, but in the case of Trace, the title fits like a glove. There is nothing explicit about this album; everything is flowing in an undercurrent, from the the faint electronic whispers to the bursts of euphoric drum and bass. This album may have a repetitive feel to it, but that should not deter from its quality. As with any ambient works, redundancy is inevitable, but what is important is the general aesthetics of the reaming instrumentation. This album is also a pretty large departure from the harshness of Further, but fans should not be deterred because Mike and Cadoo have once again created a masterpiece of IDM."
4,Soundtrack for the end of the world,"The best way to describe ""Trace"", is beautiful, exiling soundscapes combined with super dark, noise filtered drum and bass loops. The type of cd you put on when your driving through Utah alone and are pretending to some sort of Mad Max hipster with a lot on your mind. A must have for the ambient enthused."
5,So Beautiful!!,I ordered this set and was so impressed with it! the flatware is so beautiful!! and the storage chest is nice too!! and it was an amazing buy!!!
1,UNBALANCED VIEW!!,"Reading this book was like listening to a liberals campaign speech.The only people who would call this book a balanced view, would be someone who thinks that a tax cut is money that doesn't belong to us.Reagan was the greatest President we ever had but distortions by people like this author would prefer to look at Reagan's achievement with a liberal spin."
1,Do you want fair and unbiased? This is NOT the book for you!,"As a reader who just wants an evenhanded view of American history in hindsight, I believed the LA Times take on the back cover when browsing it in a store. (Silly me....forgot the Times are socialists) The author completely rips Reagan's life from his religious upbringing, his parents, and his political and acting career without ONE good thing to say, not even an acknowledgement about the strength he had to set up the country for the prosperous times we now enjoy. This unembarassed Clinton lover should have his writing privilages stripped just for being so cowardly as to not put on the cover that this book will not be unbiased. This book WILL be returned to the store on grounds of false advertising, and will from this point on trust READERS reviews."
5,Lots of fun,My 7 year old daughter got this for Christmas last year. We ended up playing with it all year. I guess I was lucky with the magic wand. She loved the test tubes and after a while she was able to follow the directions and do the experiments herself. I would highly recommend this as well as other products from this company.
4,"Educational & fun, but one of the packets was ripped!","I bought this for my son for Christmas, knowing how much he loves Harry Potter, and it was a huge hit! Not only does it make learning and science super fun, but there are a number of different activities (as opposed to only one or two!) so it has kept him engaged for hours on end. The one disappointment was that, when we opened the box, there was white powder EVERYwhere, so that I had to clean all of the test tubes, etc. before they could be used. Fortunately, the packet that had a tear in it was the baking soda, which we had on hand, and not on the of the harder-to-find chemical compounds, so no harm, no foul. But I did have to take off 1 star for this. Other than that, I would highly recommend this for kit to kids of (almost) all ages, especially if they're Harry Potter fans!"
2,Cool for maybe 4 or 5 year olds at best,"I think if I'd bought this for my son when he was 4 or 5, he would've been thrilled, but at 7, it was just boring. The ""experiments"" were like mixing blue and red water to make, Tadah! purple! (What happens if you mix blue and yellow? etc) Adding baking soda to vinegar to make it bubble over, adding a clear liquid with a magic ""potion"" powder to a colored liquid (and waving the magic wand for effect) to make the color disappear. The experiments were very easy to do, but it was just too simplistic for him to be remotely interested past those 3 ""experiments"" and it went straight into the trash."
2,Not what very creative!!!,"I bought this for my 7 and 9 year old they were so excited we all love science! all the experiments were the same just a different sequence of adding ingredients. After doing the first 2 experiments my kids said that they are all the same which they were. The last experiment is glowing bubbling potion, it didn't glow very well we waited all day until night time to do this one. The only plus I will give it is there is enough material to do the experiments over all except for the glow in the dark bubbling potion which is the only one my kids wanted to do again. Overall it was a waste of time my kids lost interest very quickly I'd say to go with a kit with several different types of experiments!!!!!!!"
2,"Great idea, poorly executed","Well, cool, make a magic wand! What could be better for a school age child into fantasy books? But oh no, the ends of the wand do NOT FIT the tube, so the wand cannot be made- SO, massive disappointment for the excited child, complete annoyance for the parent! How hard would it be for the maker of this product to include pieces that actually fit together? The wand consists of 2 stoppers and a plastic tube, this is not rocket science!"
3,Missing the smoking fingers,"This was fun, but we purchased it mostly for the smoking fingers trick, which was not included. Only buy it if you don't care if you have this. Otherwise it is fun. Some of the tricks are similar."
3,No smoking fingers :(,"My son enjoyed this science kit. I think it is a little over-priced since there are only a few tricks and the picture is outdated. The new box says ""Magic at your fingertips"" NOT ""Make your fingers smoke"". I wanted to see that trick. It's a so-so kit. He liked it, though. I'm glad it was under $15 when I bought it."
5,Loved it!!,"I bought this for my son's birthday - and he loves it! After making his wand, he couldn't wait to do ""real Magic"". We have had the best time playing with this!"
4,great fun!,"My 8-year old received this for a birthday gift and we've already gone through all the tricks. We had fun together following the directions and making our own experiments, too. Yes, the magician's wand is difficult -- but not impossible. The tight end pieces are a blessing, as the ooey-gooey crystals won't leak! Loved this gift!"
5,Daddy how does.............,"Well if you here this a lot they have a kit for just about everything. A great time spending tool and you both will learn something as you play, plus there is a sweet treat at the end."
3,Good ideas--not packed well.,"This set is definitely educational for my 8-year-old grandson. However, when the set arrived, one of the packets of dry material had been ""punctured"" by another item in the bag and had leaked out. I had to ""repack"" the material as there was not time to return it before giving it as a gift. The company needs to rethink their packing of the items in the box."
2,Well that was disappointing!,"My 8 year old daughter and I spent the afternoon doing all the experiments and activities contained in the kit. Once completed she looked up and said ""Well that was disappointing"". Enough said, I also have some free finger smoke for anyone who wants it."
1,great customer service,I had great customer service tracking down this gift item that did not arrive in time for Christmas.I'm sure the granddaughter will be pleased when it arrives in time for her birthday.
3,A little flimsey,"This dog door works. It is not built to withstand big dogs, though. I do not allow my dogs to use it at will, only on nice days. We live in a rainy climate, so muddy, wet feet are not wanted stomping through the house.The door was easy enough to install. It fit after the first cutting of the hole. The dogs figured how to use it quickly.The flap does not fall straight after a dog goes through and the metal door that locks it is very stiff and hard to move."
5,"Comfortable, beautiful shoes!","So happy with these shoes! They are really comfortable, my feet feel heavenly. These shoes are also really beautiful, the heel and the overall design. Please note that (at least in my opinion), these shoes run just a little smaller than the usual Arche shoes' size. I own many Arche shoes. These shoes are a bit, but noticeably, smaller than other Arche shoes of the same size."
5,Great product!,Does exactly what the seller offer. The hight of water for my fountain is perfect and I didn't need any extra modifications to install it. I only could say that Little Gigant products should explain more clearly the differene between each of their products.
1,Could you make a worse user interface if you tried?,"Sounds like this has the same user interface as the Hello Kitty version of same. The user interface is just downright befuddling...all these extra keys you have to press to get it to send text...you press SEND, but before sending it asks you ""P/I?"" to which you respond ""ICQ CALL""... does any of this make sense? I think buying my kid a telegraph key and teaching her Morse Code would be somewhat easier. I plan to return mine and get something else for an Xmas present for my kid."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EVER!,"I bought this for my children who were overly excited to text each other back and forth and tell sister secrets and giggle and ooooh the hopes and dreams..then we opened the box. There were NO instructions in the box about how to operate. I had to look it up online. And when I did I saw a WHOLE BUNCH OF BAD REVIEWS and warnings NOT to buy this product. I'm VERY disappointed. It looks so cool but its very difficult to figure out. Instead of typing a message and hitting send, you have to go thru four or five steps. and i'm still not sure how to receive one from the other one. I wouldnt give this stuff away for free. The manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves. This is the WORST toy I have EVER bought."
4,Pretty dated but full of nice hot licks nonetheless..,"For those listeners who simply can't handle multi-lingual stream of consciousness lyrical intrusions into the musical hot licks, this CD should be avoided. For those who don't mind a little Timothy Leary along with the tunes, this will be just fine. The cover art shows a large group of individuals across several generations, commune style, but basically Group 1850 was a five piece, although I suppose some of those pictured may be significant others doubling as backup singers, accompanists, etc. The playing is indeed very hot in most places, but it may take some patience to get there since the chants are pretty heavy near the beginning of the work."
4,Excellent and a half,"I usually enjoy critical analsys, and will here, but to sound like a goofy teen, this stuff is just WHACKED OUT!I say that with affection as an out music and particularlly Kraut-rock nutcase. The other reviews are right saying this has some great Floydian psych.But for me the highlight hands down is ""I Put My Hand On Your Shoulder,"" a complete acid slice---the type of track you may ""think"" you cuaght on 3AM FM in 1969 but are not quite sure. Flanged drums and a monster movie narration about someone ""scratching the walls of his cell."" As out as the Doors got on their live excursions if not more so.If you like the group named narritive track from Brainticket'sCottonwoodhill, this is even further out there--the outer reaches of out-psych.WOWIE!"
3,Acid-heads rejoice,Has to be from a different point in time to fully comprehend what is being put forth here. Just relax.
2,Amazing ...,"Amazing ... that this many people could get together at one time and none of them have a good musical idea! I listened to this several times, thinking it was just my mood or the phase of the moon, but it was still horrible each time. I would never recommend this to anyone I liked!"
5,Ultimate Psychedelia,"If you buy just one late 60s psychedelic album, this would be a great start. I had a tape of it in the early 90's, and when I heard the CD came out with tons of bonus trax, I was in heaven. It's worth the import price! Great melodies, strong guitar work, and experimentation that works! If you like Pink Floyd, Psychedelic Music, or just good late 60s music, then this is the S@#T. You may also want to check out Bent Wind, Aguaturbia, Music Emporium, Morgen, Tomorrow, etc."
2,WRONG,"THE ITEM TOTALLY WAS WRONG APPLICATION AS MY GM E BRAKE PAD IS ENCAPSULATED OVER A METAL 4 PRONG ATTACHMENT DEVICE AND THE REPLACEMENT WAS A SLIDE OVER PEDAL PAD AND NOT DESIGNED FOR MY TRUCK LEVER AT ALL , FRUSTRATED I GLUED IT ON :) HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST ? FOREVER IF I DON'T USE IT...............CLARK"
2,Don't work as well with Avent Natural Bottles,"While these discs will still fit on the top of an Avent Natural bottle and hold a seal, they don't fit snugly in the nipple hole like they do with Avent Classic bottles. So milk won't leak or spill, but when you unscrew the ring, you have two pieces to mess with. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a sealing disc for the Natural bottles- hopefully they're coming soon!"
3,Warps and stains in dishwasher.,"I bought these disks to use with my Avent bottles for storing breast milk and later homemade baby food. I've been using them for about two months now, and had to order more. I have had no problems washing my other Advent products in the dishwasher on the delicate setting, but these sealing disks warped after several washes and stained a light orange after one. I have ordered more and will have to hand wash them."
5,I wish I had found them sooner.,We limped along without these sealing lids for so long until I saw them on Amazon. It allowed us to prepare bottles ahead of time as I felt more comfortable using these for sealing instead of the normal Avent nipple/cap combo. It was also nice to throw a few sealed bottles into the diaper bag and then just pop the disc out and swap with a nipple when we were ready to feed the baby. They take up so much less room in the fridge or diaper bag compared to having a nipple on the bottles. We never had any leaks or other issue. I am just glad to have found them.
2,"many names, questionable categorizations","Coming from a swiss/german background I can't but add to the previous reviewer's comments. Apart from the anglo-saxon mainstream the book offers little insight. I've found at least one instance of each of the following errors: 1) names sometimes carry alternate spellings that sound very similar, but are variants of a different name 2) names that are obvious variants of each other are listed separately without cross-reference 3) the ethnic categories, as far as I could tell are often questionable and in some cases plain wrong 4) at least for my ethnic background, the selection of names seems rather odd, and many names only appear in short forms 5) meanings of greek/latin names are often inaccurate Bottomline: If you are looking for some inspiration, the book is ok. It carries a wide ethnic variety of names. However if you're interested in a particular area such as nordic names, you may be disappointed or even worse, misguided."
5,Wonderful Book!,"This was a wonderful book! I'm only 13, but I just love names and this is my favorite name book out of the 6 I own. Thanks for making it wonderful, Kate Hanley!"
2,"The book should be called ""Installation only""",Very detailed instructions of installing the MKLinux and nothing else! I would hope there at least is a quick reference for basic setup and configure of the system. No help at all after the system is up running.
4,Well it is dead easy and it's not..,"This is the ideal starting point for a non unix human into the weird world of linux.. just follow the dots and it will run ... Sadly the book does not cover some of the bare basics of the OS itself, so while installing is really easy, getting the OS to actually do something is NOT covered... As all linux distributions vary a certain amount some things mentioned in other publications might not work..I had rather seen it included in this book."
3,"Good, but unorganized","This book included most of the information I needed to set-up, and run my mkLinux system, but it took a lot of paging back and forth to get the information I needed. Also, there are some missing steps in the info on compiling the kernel which I had to get from a mailing list. Other than that, a decent reference for those with a mac that want to play with linux."
2,Messy End,No trouble getting the plants to germinate. But then what? Messy to scoop out the dirt and seedlings to transfer to the garden plot. I think it's more efficient to buy a Jeffy set that comes with the little shrink-wrapped soil pods so you can just pick up the pod and put it where you need it.
1,Poor results.,I planted corn in these pellets with poor results. The seeds were labeled as having a 90% germination rate. I only acheived a germination rate of 7% roughly. I have recently planted more seeds in miracle grow potting soil and have seen much better results. Germination took less time and the germination percentage was quite near the seeds rating. As a result I don't think all that highly of the Jiffy 72 peat pellets.
2,Great Idea for Starting Seeds,The pods are too small and it is very difficult removing starter plants. Better results came from using small peat pots. The tray warped after two weeks and could not be used again. I would not recommend this product.
5,cape fear,"cape fear was on my list also to buy,and i have a long list.But I am enjoying my movie,it plays very very good."
2,What's the fuss?,"I read it in Hebrew and the asylum scenes reminded me of ""one flew over the cuckoos nest""; one tired cliche after another."
3,adam resurrected,"I had canceled this order the morning after ordering it the night before and it was sent anyway. I saw the movie and it was excellent and a friend loaned me the book and I enjoyed it as well. I am very disappointed the seller did not cancel my order as I had requested, the book was returned not opened. I am waiting on my refund which I hope to receive this week.In the event I do not........ what is the next procedure?Thank you,Carolyn"
1,ZZZZZZZZ BOOORING ZZZZZZZZ,"Howard Stern made a big fuss about this novel. He claimed the movie was shocking, and provocative, and one of the most disturbing things he's ever seen. So I figured the book would be even better, right?WRONG !!!!!I ordered the book, read half of it, and was bored to tears.WAY too descriptive and drawn-out. GET TO THE POINT MAN !!!!""The white walls, tan sand under the hot, scorching sun, in the arid desert, with the blue ocean on the horizon, and green cactus, with the dry wind blowing the bleached-white banners, while the blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.......JJEEEZZZZZZ.I threw this disaster in the garbage halfway through it.Unreadable.Hopefully the movie is good."
2,Does the trick,"Well I'm not all that picky with a tray like this but the description say ""Will not leak"" and when the tray is held up to a light you can clearly see small holes in the corners of the tray were it is the weakest. It isn't a very durable tray but depending on what kind of plants you plan on grow/ starting in these trays and the kind of water control you have these might work for you. I bought two, one with a dome over the top which cost me all together less then the average price of a humidity dome. Hope this helps."
1,Impassable Tutorial,"Well, I labored through 2 chapters, although it's obvious that the examples are full of bugs. Then at the end of the second chapter, I received the maddening admonishment that if I had ""performed correctly"" the previous examples, I would face success. You can't know how frustrating such a statement can be. I did perform all required steps as outlined, and I couldn't even get the example code to compile! Man, what a waste of money! If you want to learn about Apache Axis, do not purchase this book!"
4,A singer-songwriter powerhouse,"With a rare mixture of strength and vulnerability in her music, Garrison Starr's music is more ""real"" and meaningful than the vast majority of what you hear today from the singer-songwriter club. She's got the same kind of passionate delivery that the Indigo Girls have (without the ruined vocal cords), and her band on Take-Off gives the songs an added punch that's sure to set toes tapping and heads swaying everywhere. At least 7 or 8 different guitarists support Ms. Starr on the album - a different studio combo for nearly every song - but they all play with zeal and skill in equal measures. On ""Knucklehead,"" a cut that really rocks, I could have sworn Garrison was being backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood! (It was Mike Grimes and Ben Peeler.) I first heard her music on one of the ""I-10"" CDs, and was mightily impressed. Now, with ""Take-Off"" and its many high points, I've added Garrison Starr to my list of artists to follow in the future."
5,And the future is----,Crist took the racing form into the present & future. It was in the hands of guys frozen with a 1930s outlook (sorry Saul Rosen et al)and Crist pumped his energy and intelligence into a moribund product. Congratulations Steve.
2,A moment from our sponsor(s),I felt as though I was reading an info mercial. While it is nice to have info on product availability it was more than I wanted to sort through. I also found it not well organized. Cichlid identification for the purpose of appropriate care and breeding is daunting enough without adding more confusion.
1,Too general,"I found this book to be very weak and not worth the investment. The species information was VERY limited and not organized in any logical way. Malawi and Tanganyika fish are jumbled up together.Other chapters went through basic fish care and maintenance, but no particularly useful or cichlid specific information.I would not recommend this book to anyone except a real beginner."
3,"Close, but not quite.","Judith Lansdowne deserves praise for an intriguing plot and a unique and engaging hero. Unfortunately, hard-to-read dialogue and too-cutesy kiddies dimmed my enjoyment. Also, Jason/John's ready acceptance by the aristocracy seemed to facile to be quite believable for class-conscious Regency society."
5,GREAT cookie book,Have had this book forever and all the pages are dirty from use - had to buy another copy for my daughter!
2,Only fair,"Her directions are more complex than need be. Some good recipes, particularly in the Scandinavian chapter."
3,Instructions are too long,"The recipes sound good and the pictures look very nice, but the instructions are way too long. I think it could have been possible to simplify them by cutting out at least half of the instructions."
3,???? ERGO PROXY?????,csi meets elfin lied meets the twilight zone the voice dubbing is great the animation is dark but its some pretty good animation that will grab you right away. the story can get very confusing at times with weird things happining and then getting explaned later in detail. this is the first mystery anime that i have ever watched or even heard of if you have a short attention span and like alot of action this is not for you it really makes you pay attention. this is an anime that could apeal to a person who is not a fan of anime the more you watch the more you want the mystery to be explaned. i have watched alot of anime and in my opinion this is good but not great definitly a good addition to a diverse collection
5,Betty Crocker Cookbook,"As a health conscious person, always interested in calorie count, etc, this book has all the information you need for each receipe. A lot of other cookbooks don't have that."
4,"Little fan, big wind","For such a small size, this fan blows! I mean, in a good way. Maybe a tad noisy, but it blends into the background after a while. It's stylish and sturdy and I was pleasantly surprised at the force at which it circulates air."
4,Nothing kicks clay like ClayFighter!,"ClayFighter is a hilarious game that is often overlooked for not being serious enough. I wouldn't be surprised if after playing ClayFighter you'd be wondering why other fighting games are so serious.ClayFighter is a rare example of a fighting game that can be silly and fun at the same time. My only complaint are the controls... The Sega Genesis version does have better controls, yet its graphics and sound are inferior to this version.All together, though, ClayFighter is an amazing game that is one of my all-time favorite videogames to play."
4,Good look,They look good and were easy to install. They cause a little wind sound when speeding up but I guess that is expected.
5,"It's over, but well worth it.","Okay, so now it's the end of Noir. Sad but true. Well the end was very nice, emotional and oh man, the music! I want to music so bad! And hey wouldn't it be cool to have the music from the watch as a ring tone? Anyway, there're a couple sad parts, good action and it wraps up pretty well. The only problem is that I wanted to see an epilogue to the series, like what happened to the characters after everything was over. I wont say whose alive or dead since I don't want to ruin it. But watch and find out. Oh and the little red box on the back of the insert actually makes sense if you've watched the second episode, and it's funny. Anyway so long!"
3,The Odyssey Film for T.V. with Sub-Titles,"Excellent for classroom use but sub-titles don't always work. Still, I do use it in class where international students are enrolled. It arrived in good condition."
5,Seeing the sea as poetry,"What is there about 'looking' at certain kinds of scenes and sights, and phenomena which gives us such pleasure?Why do we love to see?I have read other books in this series on natural phenomena which gave great delight.But the sea somehow has a power to move our imagination, to suggestively reshape our feeling, to give us new light and new dreams?The photos here are so richly - colored, and they enable us to see the sea in ways which we with our ordinary terms of access would not .From undersea and from distances above , the photographs give us pictures which seem to be kind of poetry for the eyes."
4,An innovative orignal historical relationship with the sea,There is always an eternal expert relationship with man and the sea t'hats everlasting bright and deep.With vast orignal immense photography that envelopes the background of the water itself for creatures that are capable of adaptaion legends that had evolved into strangely shaped shells.
2,Read the fine print...,"Be aware! This product is approx. 1.5 inches X 1.5 inches. It is impossible for most humans to read. When they say minicube, they really mean microscopic-cube..."
2,"""The Best of Dave Mason"" ???","How can they possibly call it ""The Best of Dave Mason""? It's missing ""Look at you, Look at me"", without a doubt one of the best guitar solos of all time. Let them recycle the plastic on this one and get the ""Definitive Collection"" or ""Alone Together"", the original album it's on."
5,Elegant and beautiful,"This CD by 35 year-old Portland-based saxophonist Patrick Lamb is an elegant and beautiful rendering of Christmas classics. (If you like, see my reviews of his other CDs sold at Amazon.) This outstanding artist who plays with exquisite sensitivity and, where called for, power, is a still-rising talent. Note: He's extensively toured internationally with multiple Grammy winner and vocalist, Diane Schuur, and with jazz/pop vocalist Bobby Caldwell. (If you're not yet familiar with Lamb, what do Schuur and Caldwell know do you not yet know?) This CD makes a great holiday gift."
4,Not sure if you can get much smaller than this,It's just right. Small enough that I can clip it to my name badge without it being too bulky. Don't know how sturdy it is to wear and tear so that's why I can't give it a full 5 stars
4,Best Brand,"I've used peat pellets and peat pots the past few years for both my vegetable and herb gardens. This is the best brand I've tried. Used in conjunction with a seedling heat mat, I've had 100% germination 2 years in a row with the Jiffy pellets. Other brands are cheaper and available in bargain stores, but they do not have the same type of peat filling. Both cheaper brands I tried had a coarser, mulch-type peat filling, with lots of little chips and woody pieces. My seeds did not do nearly as well with either of those. The Jiffy pellets have a fine, potting-soil texture that retains moisture and doesn't wash out of the little pot when you add the water. These are cheaper in stores if you can find them, but they always seem to be out of stock in my area. Once you buy the first tray, you can re-use it and just buy Jiffy peat pellet refills after that. The plastic is not thick or sturdy, but with just a little careful handling, I've been using the same trays for two years with no problem."
5,Easy!!!!! Just LOVE it!!!,"I planted so many seeds and it was so easy!!! It eliminates the need for messy pots & soil. I am eager to see how they grow. Transplanting to the garden will be a snap as the whole thing goes right in the ground. I am definitely planning on using more of these in the future,"
4,I am bought this..,I bought this to get my plants going for the spring. I have a butt load of plants and little space to start them in. I can't wait to get this thing going and plant them and have food. Thank god for the jiffy packs
5,They work!,"I ordered three of these and only one produced results. So why 5 stars? Because the 2 that failed did so because of the funky seeds I got at a local store whose name I would never mention here O-nly S-ometimes H-arry.The only thing that makes me sad is they don't tell you how to transfer to the dirt, only that you need their special orbit shooter to do so :(. But as for the procedure they state, they work very well and I would not hesitate to say so."
1,"You don't need these, try making some yourself!","Peat moss harvesting is a pretty big environmental problem, plus, you don't need all this packaging and pizazz to make your own seed starters. You can make your own starters from recycled materials like: toilet paper rolls, paper towel rolls, yogurt cups, newspaper, milk cartons, egg cartons, left over cardboard, cereal boxes, etc. etc. Before you purchase these starters, which I understand not wanting to be convinced otherwise, consider googling ""make your own seed starter pots"" and you'll find loads of quick, simple options that you may end up preferring anyway. Plus they would be free!"
3,"Great music, poor presentation.","Sly's music holds up well against time, but Epic needs to spend some time on the packaging of this disc. If you are looking for some great music at the ""nice price"", this album is for you. If you are looking for historical footnotes, album references, or info about the family, don't bother."
5,the music and mind,sly stone is a straight visionary wizard.the songs and grooves on this disc put everything into point.the group was super bad as well.the horns and drumming and the mighty larry graham on thumping bass.but the master himself sly creating so-many different styles and concepts is pure genius.
4,The voice of funky soul!,Sly and the Family Stone were unique and beautiful while controversial. I used to listen to them on KKDA out of Ft. Worth.
4,SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE,"I HAD SLY AND THE FAMILY STONES GREATEST HITS WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER. THE MUSIC IS STILL GOOD TO ME. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD,AND THE PRICE COULD NOT BE BEAT."
5,best of class,"This is a slim, non-threatening volume that provides the essential information for a person becoming an RCIA sponsor. While avoiding the complication of precise terminology so that the book reads easily, it does distinguish the varying states of the ""candidate"" as inquirer, catechumenate, candidate, neophyte, elect ... and of the various roles RCIA sponsor, godparent, confirmation sponsor ...The information regarding the expectations of the sponsor through the full RCIA process is excellent; it is supplemented by thoughtful questions, quotes from the Catechism, Scripture and the Rite. It's only drawback is that it makes a number of assumptions about parishes that may be untrue of many parishes. Because of this, it should be provided as information that supplements the training provided by the parish not in lieu of parish training.This whole series of ""Handing on the Faith"" is solid and should be accessed any time you are seeking for resources in this area."
1,they keep falling apart!,they look great - if cheap - but they keep falling apart. I'm so sorry that I bought them!
4,Great for Highshool/College,"Have to love these. Make great decorations at home to annoy parents, and even more fun in the dorm taped to your door or wall. Nice to wake up to something so bright and cheery, and with a little bit of tapering, doll clothes make them look adorable. Also Recommended are stuffed animal flamingos. :)"
4,"Pink, Plastic, & oh so ""Tacky""!","GREAT (joke) gift idea!... I just sent a pair to my mother-in-law in Florida for Mother's Day. (She gave my husband & I an equally tacky/useless, painted plaster leopard as a wedding present! Touche!)"
5,Guard Birds of Happiness,"Pinky & Floyd are the guard birds of happiness in my garden. There just can't be any unhappiness with Pink Plastic friends around. That's why I think they are the PERFECT gift, and give a pair frequently. Warning: these lovely birds are quite allergic to large dogs."
1,Cheap Knock-Off,My past experience with this type of flamingo warns you that the plastic piece holding the legs to the body breaks far too easily. You are better off finding the original Don Featherstone flamingos because they do not have this problem.
5,Positive Strategies -- PMA & PPNT,"Napoleon Hill is the founding master of PMA = Positive Mental Attitude. His book is a truly inspirational classic that can be enthusiastically recommended to anyone who wants to improve her or his mental attitude and thinking style. This book is both insightful and practical. Cognitive psychology does, of course, have some new updates that can be added to Hill's classic PMA formulation. For example, the cognitive strategy or thinking style of 'constructive pessimism' is explained in Dr. Norem's book The Positive Power of Negative Thinking (PPNT) which is a recent psychology update of the Norman Vincent Peale classic about Positive Thinking. Not every strategy works equally well for every individual. Only one thing is certain -- it is a good thing to work on improving one's mental attitude and thinking style. I recommend PMA !!"
4,The same Nuku Nuku? No not at all.,"The Dash series is a good stand alone if you've never seen the original. If you have the original this has a Tenchi in Tokyo feel to it, you know all the players but every thing else is different. The dash story line is longer and gives time for a few, ever so popular, plot twists that keep the story interesting. There were two things that were a little on the irritating side, Nuku Nuku's statement of purpose (once was OK but it gets old after the second episode) and the English dub has to be the worst I've ever herd (I switched to Japanese W/ subtitles half way through the first episode). All in all I liked the new story line and recommend all three DVD's."
3,An okay anime,This is ok. I got it and i thought this was kinda of boring but its good sometimes. Im probley not going to get all the nuku nuku dvds. I think this series as a slow story line.
3,Just Enough,"Ideal for those starting out on their study of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era (as one would expect from a university history text), Owen Connelly's modest volume has much to recommend it: fresh, readable style; decent maps, a comprehensive bibliography (pointing the way for future purchases!) and quite a few interesting little kernels that one seldom comes across. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the siblings of Napoleon; Jerome's sponsorship of Gauss, Louis' campaign for breast-feeding, Joseph's conversion of El Prado into an art museum. I heartily recommend this book as an excellent staging ground for future operations into the hinterlands of Napoleonic literature. I also recommend Connelly's BLUNDERING TO GLORY as a vey good next step on your journey."
5,It's all here,"I completely agree with the previous review in every respect except I feel the book deserves more stars, given the ""rating inflation"" prevalent with so many of the titles reviewed. I wouldn't want anyone to be put off getting this book. Connelly has squeezed an incredible amount of information into a small amount of space. As usual, he is clear and entertaining. People interested in the period should check out his other titles."
1,"Poorly-written, considering he's a historian.","This guy may know his stuff, but his writing style is so off-putting that it is hard to pay attention without noticing the many grammatical errors and poor sentence structure. Maybe in the new $95 version, or whatever ridiculous cost they have for this book nowadays, is acceptable and maybe even readable. However, unless this is absolutely mandatory for a class, do not purchase this book. And, if you aren't convinced at my rating, buy a used one for sixty-eight cents instead of buying it new. Truth be told, I'm pretty sure this historian has passed away so the royalties would not be going to him, anyway."
4,A wonderful compilation of Shaker history and design.,"Christian Becksvoort's book is a bit surprising in that the first third of the book (a full ninety pages) addresses Shaker philosophy more than furniture design itself, but the reading is well worth it. Each piece of furniture is shown by only one (terrific) photograph and is accompanied by very limited information. Additional pictures of some of the construction details would have been well worth it. Having read the book, however, one should be able to understand the Shaker philosophy of furniture design well enough to develop the construction details in an authentic manner."
2,"Great game, fatal flaw","My son (11 years old) loves this game, but it has a fatal flaw for him. Like his other Megaman game, it has started over when he was saving and his game lost power. OTher games must be protected against erasing/start-over, because his other games have never started over."
5,Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel review,"It is defiantly a new twist in the Mega Man story line, the missions are fun and its a really good game."
1,not what you think,"With a title of Signature Sounds, Styles & Techniques you might think Joe breaks down some of his licks, signature riffs but noThe title does not reflect what is on the dvd, if you want to watch Joe play a few different guitars and his approach playing themIt's good, as for anything else you don't even get to see his amp/pedal settings when he talks about his gear. So if you expect a instructional style dvd don't buy it you will be as disappointed as I was."
3,What Could Have Been,"Joe Bonamassa is one of the great inspirations in blues guitar these days carrying the tourch for SRV and others who have gone.That being said this is just you watching Joe show you his Stuff Amps, Guitars, Effects Boxes.But what i really wanted to learn was some of his technique and lead examples.This dvd has a VERY short section on soloing as to be almost non existent.If you have watched his other concert dvd(live at rockplast) you know that he has a huge arsenal of riff's and cool turnarounds that he could be sharing with asspiring guitar players and none of that is apparent in this dvd at all.So you are left with Joe firering off leads while explaining the virtues of the Strat,Tele,Lespaul but no-way to learn any of the rapid fire shots he has just played.Its truly maddening.I did purchase a Reverend Drive Train overdrive pedal on Ebay that he was glowing over however so some good did come of this dvd but not enough to change my mind about giving this 3 stars."
5,"Joe Bonamassa - overview of guitars, amps etc","This is for people that play guitars. He shows the uses of fenders and other makes of guitars, how to play each guitar, how to change amps and what amps to use. It is a technical DVD and really good for people that play music. I dont play a guitar but loved the sounds like Violin he created using a guitar. He is certainly a master of the guitar - he can play like Eric Clapton, SRV and Jimmi Hendix. Worth buying this DVD. Gave me an insight into the complexities of playing a guitar properly."
3,Bonamassa video,"This dvd is great for those fans of Bonamassa that want to know what effects and amps he uses. He also has a great breakdown on how to play gibson and fender guitars, and how to get a alot of different sounds from them."
1,Save your money!!,"Front and back cover are quality photo's both in depth and color. Everything else in between is in black and white on the cheap newsprint paper. Given that, there is no way to show any descent quality depictions or illustrations of snakes. Save your money and get ""snakes of the southeast"" by Whit Gibbons and Mike Dorcus. It is absolutly the best snake book and reference guide along with more quality pictures than you could ever ask for. I checked it out at my local library first before buying it. Mark P. Mooresville NC"
3,"This guide covers the whole country, and it's BIG","If you are planning a trip with only a couple of major stops, this isn't the right guide for you. It's very thick and very condensed. The maps, although a nice book size, may not help you all that much getting around in a city. This is a guide for someone who has the time to travel all around Italy (I envy those people!). For those of us who are going to Venice and Florence, individual city guides have much more specific information and better maps. The Blue Guides are perfect for history, art, and culture (great walking tours). Most of the specifics for planning can now be found on the Internet, instead of in a bulky guide. But if you need a more planning oriented guide of only a city or two, try the Access Guides. They have great maps of each neighborhood of a city, along with hotel, restaurant, and sight-seeing tips."
5,A great Veggie Tales video,"This is another wonderful VT video. The moral of this show is sharing, and Archibald the Asparagus has taken over Veggie Tales for the episode. With the help of the French Peas, he first stages the first all-veggie production of Shakespeare's ""Omelet"", involving a Prince Omelet of Denmark and a shortage of eggs. The second story is the ""Rogers and Hammerstein"" musical called ""Lyle the Kindly Viking"", which tells the story of Lyle, who is the only Viking who does not go on raids with the others. Instead, he shares his homemade potholders with neighbors.This movie has some great musical moments and is an excellent way to help teach sharing to youngsters. My kids love the songs and the stories, and I find myself singing along, too."
3,Worth reading,"JUSTICE DENIED is the second installment of the Judge Wilhemina Carson series. The first was SILICONE SOLUTION, and Ms. Vogt is now writing a third installment called GASPARILLA GOLD.Judge Willa Carson is back again, but this time it's personal. Her husband George is accused of killing General Albert Andrews, Tampa's highest-ranking Army officer and nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. The police found George's gun was the murder weapon so they refused to look at any other suspects, even though the suspect list is long. Even the General's own family had reasons to want him dead. Willa must solve this crime before her dear husband George is sentenced to death.Judge Willa Carson is an exciting multi-faceted character. The reader is taken on a wild ride with many twists and turns that keep the reader guessing at whodunit up until the very ending. M. Diane Vogt has been a lawyer for over twenty years and writes with an insider's knowledge of the Florida court system and the political scene."
5,GREAT BOOK !!!!!!,"This book was sooo good, definitely one of Bonnie Bryants better books.I don't care what the others say I LOVE the new covers! but ant way this book is hilarious! It was so funny that Stevie had to work with Veronica! her worst nightmare! and I laughed out loud when they went on there shopping expedetion! This book is a must have. I would I would recamined this to ant person who wants a gooh laugh and loves horses."
5,Sleepnet,Glad I was able to find the product via Amazon since I couldn't locate any in local stores.
2,small,"For a medical alert charm, I think this one is too small. In the enlarged picture it looks great - real life it it hard to read... What is A * T??? you have to guess that it would mean Allergic To, but in a medical emergency, do you really want them guessing???"
5,BE CAREFUL YOU ARE NOT BUYING A BOOTLEG!!!!,"The album itself is genius and that's why I gave it 5 stars, but the real reason for this review is the fact that I bought a ""new"" copy of this here at amazon from a seller and what I got was a cheaply reproduced bootleg. I doubt the seller knew this was a bootleg, but I have the LP and used to own the CD and this new re-issue is an obvious fake. The printing on the inserts is awful however the sound on the CD is okay. That said, if you do not own this on any other format and can live with the fact that Test Dept is losing money and some scumbag is making money off of their art, you should hear this album!"
5,One of the Best,"On a short list of all time great contemporary Christian recordings this would have to be included. Very few recordings compare to What they put together on this CD. I have no horse in this race but from the opener ""Living in the Pages"" to ""The Great Exchange"" is a spiritual journey like few others. Yea I like it..."
5,BANDIDAS Ay Caramba,"I have only seen the first half hour due to stupid Jet Blue flights but I was thoroughly interested and thrilled at such a fun movie. There was comedy, Catfights, drama, Thriller, Sexiness (Salma hayek and Penelope Cruz come on who can get better than that). And just overall this movie I thought was goodBuy it because I will!"
4,As the reviewers say...,"...with Hayek and Cruz filling the screen, what's there not to like? The only improvement would have been a Spanish-language film with English subtitles..."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed it's cheesiness & spunk!,"Penelope Cruz & Salma Hayek team up in a slapstick western about 2 girls whose father's are murdered on the same day by the same man. they set out to take him out and start robbing banks at gun point to help with their mission. in the mean time, they must stop him from stealing millions of dollars in gold & with some help along the way from fellow friends, these girls are more then ready to stop the ruthless man. I have to admit, these two girls have never been sexier! lots of nice cleavage shots! the acting is spot on! some of the lines Penelope delivers would never be funny if it wasn't for her, she just makes them work for some reason! there's alot of flaws in the plot, yes it's predictable for the most, yes there's not a strong plot. it's just one of those feel good films that lets you enjoy it & I did!"
4,Wouldn't be worth it without Penelope and Salma,"It was an ok movie. Salma and Penelope looked great. If it weren't for them, the movie would be a 3 star pic at best. It is one of those ""must-see"" movies once, but not worth buying the DVD. I wouldn't watch it again"
5,Bandidas,"Bandidas is a great movie in the ""Robin Hood"" tradition of stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Add to that the 2 female characters who are thrown together to pull this off, makes for a fun,funny, and action packed romp. Add the great acting and I found it a winner all the way around. This is one movie I could watch repeatedly just to get some serious laughing done."
5,Great fun movie!,"This was a great movie. It was adventerous, and funny. All in all a splendid 'feel-good' story! Cruz and Hayek make a great team, and it shows in their acting."
5,Excellent Entertainment,"This is an excellent light hearted comedy / action film. Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek team up as partner ""cowboys"" robbing banks to avenge robbery and murder and there is great interaction between them. The bonus is that they are gorgeous. Steve Zahn becomes their lucky accomplice, which man wouldn't have liked to play his role ?The editing is slick and the fast pace never falters. There are snippets of appropriate classical music in the score which enhances the already lively sound track. The widescreen format is well used in the open landscapes and the moving camera gives a new dimension to the picture.I see that the film never had a nationwide studio release and it is certainly not heard of in the UK, what a shame !"
1,"a junior high level screenplay, childish, stupid and cliched","what a horrible screenplay with a bore-to-death storyline. the land grabbing murderous gringos pushed too far. two young mexicano women, one rich and one poor, turned bandias to revenge for their familias plus a horse smarter than the general human population... blah, blah, blah. does it sound like a junior high school student's writing project? what a stupid entry level movie format! this movie is so pretentious, shallow and so cliched to the extreme. sorry, i used a screw driver to scratch and scrap the whole dvd disk and threw it away."
3,fun but not great,"Maria (Penelope Cruz) and Sara (Salma Hayek) have good reasons to become bank robbers, and will get help from Quentin (Steve Zahn) and Buck (Sam Shepard). They soon will be wanted dead or alive.While this requires a *heavy* suspension of disbelief, this movie is not as funny as it is thought to be. Its ""action"" side is rather limited, especially between the two actresses.I do like Hayek as an actress, but do not care for Cruz's acting.Fun entertainment to watch on a rainy day... or if you have absolutely nothing else to watch."
3,Don't buy this set!,"If this set actually contained the advertised songs I would have given it five stars. However, when you receive it, the songs are all different! If you are looking for a general Christmas jazz set, this one is OK ... But if you are looking for those specific songs I would look elsewhere."
5,Just awesome! Just AWESOME!,"This song ""Watch the Lamb."" is something else. The music is beautiful and the lyrics are poetic. I have performed a skit to it in India and it just blew everyone away, including me, and still does today. God Bless you Ray!"
4,holiday in mallorca,"really good german 80's punk rock. There's a slight english punk bands influence, but it is still original german product."
4,A good anime for all ages,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this. thankfully i was pleasently surprised. Being a Final Fantasy fan already it wasn't difficult to like it. However if you are not a FF fan, i think you will still enjoy this anime. The story is done very well, and although the animation isn't cutting edge, the cg included makes up for it. I could get into the story and spoil everything, but what's the fun in that? All in all a great dvd collection."
5,This is for the entire show,"Oh, wow. I can't complain much about this. Although some things I didn't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed, this was still very effective on me. It may've been better as a game or not, I don't know. There were several times where this made me so emotional I wanted to cry for the characters. The silent and melancholy Kaze, the hilarious and deranged Cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins. Even for the short time you know them, they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching. I know some people may not be satisfied with this, but I was. I recommend it!"
1,"Another disappoint, what a surprise.","Once again I am disappointed. I consider myself very open with anime, but this series really has pissed me off. First lets all think back at the great stories the games provide. The characters and their history, vibrant worlds that were created for each game. Everyone here has their favorite FF game and reasons why they loved it. Think about those reasons, hold in your mind and now compare them to Final Fantasy Unlimited. If you are honestly doing it, then you realize what garbage we've been handed. I am not going to go and try to convice anyone with a long agrument about what pile of dodo this anime is. The only reason this series would get attention is because it has FINAL FANTASTY as its title name. Just think about what I said above."
5,Not at all really final fantasy but still awesome!,"When I got this I read the reviews and didn't go into it really thinking it was asscoiated with final fantasy...Though it has the final fantasy name it's not at all about FF but still I found myself wanting to watch more and more..The animation isn't the up to FF standards but I still thought it was good unlike the review below me..I found myself laughing at some points and with loveable characters like lisa,yuh and ai you'll find yourself wanting more and chobi (think thats how you spell it) that chocoobo cracked me up...If your into light hearted anime then you should for sure pick this up!!!!..though the ending leaves you wondering a lil but all in all I would say it was worth the 40.00 for an awesome anime series and also my 3rd fav behind evangelion and full metal of course =)...But it also beat out trigun so that should say something cause trigun was another awesome show!...anyways,like I said,Awesome series 5/5!!"
5,Highly enjoy it,"I enjoy this anime not because it has the ""Final Fantasy name""cause I enjoy the plot and characters.The anime gets such low ratings cause they think of it as ""Final Fantasy"" and base it off the games. FFU is an orginal Final Fantasy title, like every final fantasy game has it's own storyline. What people actually want is a final fantasy anime that is based on one of the games. People have no concideration for an original FF storyline anime. That's why it gets such a low rating. I am not a newbie to anime, I personally look for the message of FFU, which is family and friends conqure evil and keep hopes high. I think to be a true fan of this anime is to get its message. I would suggest this to non-final fantasy fans, because they wouldn't judge the anime on how Final Fantsish it is."
2,Oh what it could have been.,"Final Fantasy has the makings of a pretty good show, it really does. But as I understand things Square kinda ran out of money before they finished making the show. There really should have been more episodes, but there arn't. The premise for the show is reasonably good and the characters are pretty good too. It's just that not much happens and when it does everything happens way to fast. The first 20 odd episodes are kind of slow to develop the plot and then in the last episode they throw what should have been about ten episodes of plot development at you in about a minute and a half for a finale which, while spectacular, is really not all that good and poorly resolved. My advise is to not bother buying the show and to borrow it from someone else."
5,Great Series!!,"Final Fantasy Unlimited (FF:U) is a great series about 2 kids looking for there parents in a strange world. They meet a man named Kaze who seems to be looking for someone. They are attacked by a stange man....er...boy named Count Tyrant and his deathlords. They must survive and find there parents before the Count finds them. The series is full of action and comedy, and the characters are wonderful. Even if you hated all the FF games, give this anime a check, you'll be glad you did!"
3,3 episodes?,Why are there only 3 episodes on this DVD but the price is the exact same as one with 4 episodes? I think the series is starting to fall apart at this point. It's time to rap things up but there's still so much unresolved. There's also a lot of unnecessary plot twists like this ocean puzzle thing and White Cloud's brother.
2,Poor animation and VERY boring,"I picked this up because the character designer does some great stuff. I wasn't expecting anything incredible and got even less. I suppose some people like this sort of thing, but this dragged on way too long for me. I wouldn't mind poor animation if the story was at least half way engaging. The first episode on this DVD is rediculously stupid. The villian character pops up out of nowhere over and over again and it is irritating to say the least.The last episode on this DVD had decent to good animation as they apparently changed up the team (different art direction and flat, single local color style of character animation). If you really want to see these episodes -- rent. Don't make the same mistake as I did. Nice box art and a reasonably good 20 minutes of animation really aren't worth the price of this disk."
1,NOT USABLE,"The one I received did not contain an inner circle so you can't actually use it for anything. In theory, it might be nice, but I'll just have to throw away the one I received since draping the fabric across a single hoop really does no good. If there is a separate piece you're supposed to order for the inner circle, they should have made that clear because I was under the impression I could actually USE this as an embroidery hoop after purchasing it."
5,People think it is cool,"It started to turn yellow underneath where the skulls are. It is very protective, I have dropped it like seven times and nothing has happened to it. It does have a few bubbles in it, but it is fine."
3,British Pop Before the Beatles,"Though some of this material overlaps the beginnings of the Mersey Sound, Barry's early arranging, writing, and producing efforts are very much pre-Beatles. This is a singer's world. The rock group doesn't exist on this release. There are plenty of songs by those known in the US (well, if you have been paying attention at all) including Adam Faith and Tommy Steele. The fun is discovering artists you've never heard of, though. Plenty of that here.Nice packaging, including a very hip color vintage photo of Barry sitting next to hi-fi from long ago."
1,"Barack Obama ""before his time""","The book, written by Obama's pal Bill Ayers, sums it up: give up your freedoms, liberties, and independence in exchange for communist and socialist mantras. Obama ""the savior"" will help accelerate this.People, wake up. Obama is dangerous and this book is an excellent proxy for his true intentions and views."
1,"Not Ready for Playing, Neck Angle too low","Length:: 3:26 MinsIntroduction to the Bargain Mandolin, discussion about shortcomings, fit and finish, setup, and playing demonstration of the sound."
5,Fun Dance Music from Northeastern Brazil,"Forró is the name of a cluster of dance styles from the dry ranches and towns of Northeastern Brazil, though popularized further south in Rio de Janeiro. Its instrumentation of accordion, triangle, and sometimes drum and guitar has the sound and lively spirit of Lousiana cajon and Creole zydeco. Forró recordings are not readily available in the United States. David Byrne's compilation of ""Brazil Classics 3"" offers, well, many classics. This particular anthology features six groups of musicians and comparatively more contemporary recordings. Many of the tunes are composed by Luiz Gonazaga, a pioneer of accordion form. The 20 tracks provide a great variety of substyles: baio, coco, rojo, quadrilha, xaxode. xote. This is fun and cheerful country music with simple 4/4 and 2/4 rhythms. If you regard Brazilian music as just bossa nova, samba, choro, Afro-Brazilian spiritual forms, and American-influenced popular music, listen to this album . . . and enjoy!"
4,A Fun Compilation,"A great disc filled with many ""lost"" remixes, as well as 80's tracks they just don't play on the radio anymore.Terrific sound quality. A good deal for the money. Plus you get the Dance Mix of ""A Girl In Trouble (Is A Temporary Thing)"" which is unavailable on CD anywhere else.Buy it now, and start the party!!!"
3,Doesn't work with Tiger,"When you connect this thing to OS X Tiger, expect very strange things to happen. I'm going to sell this one to a pc person and buy myself a nifty new mighty mouse!"
1,A great idea but it doesn't last.,"This mouse relies on a short insert that fits into a USB port, It is very vulnerable to damage if you move your laptop or heaven forbid use it as a LAPTOP. (i.e. on your lap.) I puchased my mouse on July 7, 2005 and it went bye bye on Sept 17th 2005. I am really angry about the fragility of the adapter. I had to buy batteries 4 times during that short period. It is a great mouse that needs better engineering. Think twice before spending $37.00 for 2 months use."
4,True to form,"While the songs on this CD are a little more reserved than I've come to expect from Popa, I find the CD to be very good. The one time that I saw him live he played a subdued first set and then proceeded to blow the roof off of the place in his second set. Still, I don't think you can go wrong with a live offering from PC."
1,Left Me Weak,"Having seen Poppa Chubby play live and having bought his other live CD, I bought this CD with high-hopes of listening to a hard-driving rock/blues piece of music. Instead, I found it to be an uninspiring, lacking in energy and intensity, and ho-hum live CD. Poppa doesn't seem to be into it and neither does the audience. If you are looking for a gritty, loud, greasy, boisterous, blues/rock CD, this isn't it.Try again, Poppa. Next time, turn it up and let it rip."
3,Like A DVD to Watch if you Have Nothing Else to Do,"The ""Bruce Wayne"" reviewer here is nuts, this is by no means terrible but just something to read and kill time if you have nothing else to do, like renting a DVD to kill time, that you normally wouldn't watch but helped you kill a few hours."
1,Tasteless; without class or wit,"Horrible. I'm a rabid fan of detective stories, and I have no problem with them carrying a touch of an erotic edge, but this was just tasteless. The main character looks like a pretty-boy, with his feathered blonde hair and his clueless dialogue. There is no possible way you could become attatched to this loser.God what a horrible book. The only thing that comes close to giving it even 2 stars is the artwork."
1,it sucks,it [.......] unless you enjoy really bad cross-over smooth jazz/easy listening crap. Bill has a great voice and i had only heard ain't no sunshine and use me up. what a damn dissapointment! i expected far different styling.
5,The greatest!,"I think that this CD is WONDERFUL. Songs like ""Lean on Me,"" ""Just the two of Us,"" and ""Lovely Day""(the awesome song in the Khaki Soul commercial) are my favorites! This is a keeper!"
4,No significant diff. between 4th and 5th edition,"I would have given this a 5 star except there is no big difference between this edition and the previous one. We use this book in our econ class, students are told it's ok to buy either edition."
4,Straight Forward Christmas Carols,"What I like best about this album is that the arrangements are very true to the original carols. There if very little in the way of flourish, no long instrumental sections, and they sing all of the verses that you are used to singing in church."
5,Great Music,"I listen to this CD everyday, at home atr work and while traveling to and from work - such awesome Christmas music"
4,Epson 1705c & MacOs wireless,"The Epson 1705c projector does not work wirelessly with Leopard (MacOs10.5) on the Mac, but it does using Tiger. The unit works with a wired connection of course. Fortunately, I have a MacBook with Tiger (and an Intel Mac with Leopard). The projector is very light, but quite bright. It is supposed to show video at 30 fps, which it probably does, but quicktime projected from the Mac was jerky. I have only had this for a couple of hours so I will learn more. Wireless projection of powerpoint was very good. So far, I am pleased.Later, Boris Balley, artists, gave an 1.5 hr powerpoint presentation of his work. He had three 1MB images per slide projected wirelessly from a Mac using Tiger as the operating system. It was flawless. March 2008: Now Epson has an update for Leopard on the Intel Mac that works wirelessly. It is great.James BairdProfessor, Brown U."
4,1920's Spiritualism,"This is my first ever review of a book. I was moved to do it, as this is a special book. The dialog between the characters is clever and at times quite humorous. The author manages to keep you guessing throughout the book and leaves you wondering at the end if the psychic, Mina, is for real. I loved the characters and had a very difficult time putting the book down. I highly recommend the book for anyone who is looking for something out of the ordinary."
3,Average -- some interesting moments but overall dull,"Gangemi's story of a Harvard student who gets involved in disproving the powers of various mediums starts strong and then gets bogged down in a relatively uninteresting mystery and romance.Not a bad novel, there's just nothing special here. If you haven't read The Alienist or The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, start with them first."
4,A Superb Offering,"The best complete Lp from this under-praised singer. Her collaboration with super producer Thom Bell (Bell & Creed and Delphonics fame) gave her the best material & feel to this day. From ""Silly"", ""What Two Can Do"" & ""You're All That Matters"" (the hits from the Lp) to the album cuts, this Lp is excellent. I love this sistas voice,period."
4,My melody,I have been looking for this CD for a while in the stores and even had quite a wait before receiving it thru Amazon. The CD is a classic from the song bird DW. Great addition to my oldies collection!!!
5,Super Cute!,I found myself giggling by the end of this one. Really cute illustrations and a great story. We got it @ the library but it is one I might even purchase for our own bookself.
5,Review of Elemental Gelade,"This is a great show about a young sky pirate who after a raid finds a sleeping girl among the loot and soon discovers that she is an edel raid, a ancient race that can join with humans and fight as magical weapons. then he, Cou and her, Ren travel together with 3 members of an edel raid protection group and find all kinds of adventures and mishaps along the way.Really a great show - 5 stars, two thumbs way up"
5,Reaches Where Others Can't,"If you are a survivor of abuse (I am) or know one (I'm married to one), you can't beat the level of understanding this book will give you. It's a look into places I never dreamed anybody else could get to. I truly no longer feel like nobody ""gets it"" when it comes to the feelings and issues I deal with daily.Get this book!"
2,"not solid, not nylon. cheap=cheap","I paid amazon prime $27.97 for N14100, a product described as solid braid nylon. This product is neither of those things. The braid is very loose and guaranteed to snag on non-skid or splinters. The actual manufacturers label says, and I quote: ""Contains 1 or more of: nylon, polyester, polypropylene"". I'm thinking polyester because it reminds me of a cheap leisure suit. I may use this rope to bind garbage on the way to the landfill but it will not get near my boat ."
4,what a voice!,"Standing on Shakey Ground is not only the best song on this CD its what you will be doing when everyone who hears it gets up and starts boogying. Although all the songs on this album are fantastic, its the funky groove of tunes like ""Shakey Ground"" that really stand out for me. Like the Staple Singers but wish they were just a little bit more disco/funky/James Brown? Listen to Pheobe Snow."
5,"I LOVED HARPO'S BLUES SO MUCH, I WROTE IT INTO MY BOOK!","I am the author of ""Butterscotch Blues"", a book that came out in June of 2000.The original title was called ""Harpo's Blues"" after the wonderful Phoebe Snow song. Unfortunately my editor didn't share my vision and it was changed to ""Butterscotch Blues"".""Harpo's Blues"" is pertinent to the story. Reference is made all throughout the book. It became the lead character's 'song', my chance as an author to page homage to the greatness of Phoebe.Phoebe Snow is an original. There were none like her before her and there will be none like her after. Pick up this ablum and experience it for yourself...Margaret Johnson-Hodge"
4,"""Teach Me Tonight"" is tops!","We like to compare songs from a variety of artists. Our 3 best versions of ""Teach Me Tonight"" are by Phoebe, Al Jarreau and Ella Fitzgerald. Ella is one of the greats, but she has to take second place to Phoebe's verson of ""Teach Me Tonight""! Listen to the shooting star. It's perfect."
4,Caught a mouse!,"A week after placing it in our basement, we found a mouse stuck in the pad. I believe it only works with replacement pad from the same company. I have used pad with another company, I am still waiting... I know there is another mouse because I have seen it running....Only feature I wish it had was the lid on the top to be transparent so that I don't have to open everyday to check if there is a mouse trapped."
3,a little too strong and corrosive for most,"I admit... I'm something of a music snob. When loud, corrosive guitar noise is unleashed, I'm up in the thick of it like a pig in slop. This record stumped me though...The textures and images that this music produces are so bizarre and disturbing that I can't in good conscience recommend it to the average listener. It's not that it's particularly loud, even. It's just disturbing. Real disturbing. Ministry or Trent Reznor can't touch this guy when it comes to producing nightmares.I ain't kiddin'... I fell asleep to this album once and had terrible, terrible dreams. It's still aesthetically sound, I suppose, but proceed with caution."
4,Check out the extended re-release,"I had this on audio tape once upon a time, and lent it frequently to people -- always with the caveat, ""Don't listen this for the first time while you're driving."" My copy had been given me by Gramma Beulah, a friend of the artist (who seems to be an all-around nice guy, which must be difficult to do with hundreds of people wanting to talk to him every time he turns around), and two of her friends nearly had wrecks this way.Dennis Jernigan's website says that they have re-released this album with four more songs added to it. You might want the old version, or the new one, depending on your preferences."
2,It's time this was available for a Mac!,"I have two old versions of Family Tree Maker and figured it was time to update it. Over the years I have made the switch to Macs and use a MacBook and iMac, and have an iPhone and iPod.This is a whole system of hardware that would make a great platform for Family Tree Maker. The iPhone/iPod in particular allows you create (genealogy) records and instantly add a photo via the built-in camera app. The newly announced iPad extends this capability even further.Unfortunately, I'm stuck with having to use Microsoft Windows if I want to use my family tree I've already built! This is like a step back in time!"
1,A lot of hype,"I am very disappointed with the upgrade from 8 to 9. There is hardly any difference between the two programs, and the interface is still a clumsy, antiquated, early Windows edition that Broderbund hasn't even bothered to upgrade to a more modern Windows interface. Many features are annoying that should have been corrected long ago, that only if you're a savvy Windows user can you work around--maybe. I have used this product for many years and haven't found a better substitute yet, but maybe it's because I haven't looked, and maybe it's about time. The product has hardly changed despite the many hyped ""upgrades."" Broderbund invests more energy, it appears, into the hype surrounding all of its add-ons rather than into more substantial software. The source feature is essential for accurate documentation, but it is clumsy to use and limited, and doesn't even produce the correct printed formats (consult an MLA handbook, Broderbund!!!)."
2,Looks Great But...,"I am writing this for anyone who might make the same mistake as me. I bought this thinking that i might be able to increase my knowledge of my own geneology, and it looked promising. I got many results after my first search. However, when i clicked on each individual item that the program found as a lead, they would give me no further information unless i subscribed further to their services. After already spending 50 dollars, they were asking me to make yearly subscription-adding up to hundreds of dollars per year. While I'd love to be able to trace my geneolgoy, I must say thanks, but no thanks."
1,DO NOT BUY Family Tree Maker 9 - Very VERY OLD,Do not get confused. Family Tree Maker 9 is a very old version that is from 2001. The current version is 2009. The seller of this product is being very dishonest and is selling this extremely old product at a higher price than the new software. But on the product page it has a Star claiming that you are getting a low price. Shame on Amazon.com for allowing this to happen.
1,just come in handy!,"Solo para aclarar.Sera imbecil el ke pide luces por esta fuente xq' de fabrica no las trae asi ke esperemos ke ese tipo de comentarios no se repitan, para esa gracia mejor se buska otro tipo de fuente mas colorida.Salu2..."
4,ThermalSoft Gel Hot/Cold pack oversized,Pros: This holds cold very well. It lasts a long time. I've put it in the freezer and the refrigerator. It gets a bit too stiff in the freezer. I find that putting it in the refrigerator offers enough coldness and still stays cold a long time. The larger size covers more of my lower back.Cons: Very heavy. I would also like to use it heated onece in a while but it's way too big & heavy to fit in a microwave.
4,Amazing Talent,"this is a great set of recordings. I would give it 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option. there were a few places where the recording seemed a little loud compared to others. and there was one track where another take might have been better. But truly talented."
2,Very slight,"I am a fan of New Zealand singer-songwriters, having cut my teeth on the Finns (Neil and Tim), Dave Dobbyn, and Bic Runga. Someone recommended Anika's album to me, but it didn't leave much of an impression. Some of the music and production is interesting, but the vocals and lyrics lack distinction."
5,Great album!!,"This is an awesome album! The lyrics, the tunes are all wicked aye! First started to like her songs at the Dave Dobbyn gig, and now this album is No. 1 on my list!!!"
5,Damn good tunes from a great Kiwi chick!,"Amazing debut album from New Zealand's new Singer/Songwriter Queen. Highlights of the album are ""Flowers for you"", and ""Harry and Leena's song"". As a New Zealand artist Anika has been compared to Bic Runga (Drive/Beautiful Collision) who appeared on the American Pie Soundtrack, but Anika can stand proudly alone and bask in her own talent. Thinking Room meanders between heartfelt Love-type songs and deep almost dark songs that make you want to sob, but in a good way. She's even better to see in person, so if you love this come to N.Z. for a taste of Anika playing in her barefeet. This Album features songs too good for radio, buy it and put it on heavy-rotation at your Whare. Kia Ora Anika."
4,Open your heart and you won't regret it,"I first heard of anika moa in a record store in Christchurch 5 years ago now and had no idea who she was. After an enquiry to the record store clerk I quickly learned anika was a 21yo local singer/ songwriter whom the new zealand locals were very fond and proud of. I took this CD home as a souvenier and have listened to it and appreciated it for a long time now.New Zealands answer to Jewel, the songs warm to you very quickly and if you are the sort of person that can recognise talent and give credit where credit is due, you will be telling all your friends about anika in no time.I have played this album to many people with wide ranges in musical tastes and I can honestly say they were all impressed and asking me where I bought it. Some CD's are worth taking a chance on and owning in your collection... This is one of them.Each song calls out to you, but the best tracks are Holding Me High, Falling In Love Again, Good In My Head and My Son."
3,debut,"i expected this album to be a mixed one, but that wasn't the case. just out of personal taste, i stay away from compilations and go for mixed cd's. except for this problem, i'd say this album is pretty good overall. there are a few very experimental tracks that are actually good, and if you've listened to any of his recent live sets, that's exactly what he's doing - experimenting. there's of course some banging acid techno tracks on this cd also. if you've listened to chris liberator before, then get this cd. but if you're new to acid techno or chris liberator, i'd recommend listening to some old school straight up hard acid techno first and then move on to the recent stuff. but honestly, i wouldn't recommend anyone to actually spend the money on this cd. ^^; instead, buy <london acid city>, which is available at amazon.com or <free the state>, my favorite, at amazon.co.uk."
4,Good ending to a fun trilogy.,"SIEGE OF STONE seemed a little rushed, but it was a satisfying end to this entertaining supernatural thriller trilogy. Fans of the X-Files will find it especially satisfying. Recommended."
1,Misleading product discription,"Product is presented as a practice sword. It is however, hardly suitable as a child's toy."
4,Giant Surfing,"Great movie with the history of big surf. From Makaha to Teahupoo, through the classic days of Mavericks, and the passing of Mark Foo, to the amazing Jaws. Interviews with legends such as Greg DaBull Noll to Laird Hamilton. Great footage!!! It is a great documentary and not only a whole bunch of surfing footage. The second half of this movie you will never want to stop watching. Huge Surf!!!"
5,Riding Giants (Special Edition) +++++ DVD,"This DVD is a MUST for every surf enthusiast. Even though I'm not a surfer myself, this DVD is an ultimate masterpiece. Not only that it gives you a good insight of the history of big wave surfing, it also transmits the feeling and aura these people are vitalized and spirited with, and what makes this whole ""real"" surfer scene so special and enjoyable to watch.Again it's just a must and probably one of the best dollars spend.Enjoy, 'cos you will!"
4,good material.,"good material for the ones who love big wave surfing. The footage is awesome and the surfers are phenomenal. I liked it a lot, so much I will buy another one for my cousin."
5,Not a a Surfer?,"No problem, this blue ray can be watch byeveryone, tells us the storyabout how big surfing starts,my girlfriend dosent even likethe water! and im not a hardcore surfer,but she love this Movie*Documentarysome footage was transform into a HIDEF so qaulity in some parts in not that great,anyway....youll enjoy every minute of it...Regards all from Cabo..."
4,Well worth the watch,"I am a big fan of good surf movies. Although I couldn't say this is the best of the best, it IS a great movie for anyone who is interested in surf history, loves the ocean or is in the mood for a good soundtrack movie.I really liked when the director says he doesn't want to be pidgeon-holed as just a documentary film maker or only a sports film maker so he was trying to find that balance of making a sports film/documentary/good story that everyone could watch. I felt he did just that. This film covers multiple genre's.Extras:Making of, Blue carpet movie premiere, deleted scenes, 2 commentaries and a little more made for good special features. The deleted scenes when they ask the old school surfers to talk surfer lingo was pretty funny.I picked it up on Bluray for the reason that these movies have good soundtracks and the ocean/surfing would look amazing.Well made and great addition to any collection of sports/surf movies."
2,dull,"It was a neat concept- one used by Anne Sexton in ""Transformations"" - but the execution was disappointing. Lacking in imagination and originality. I felt as though I were reading a simplified encyclopedia entry with a couple of vague prose-like attempts at embellishment."
5,Great Stuff!!,I love this product!! I needed a better top coat nail polish and I bought this on a whim and now I wouldn't trade it for anything!
2,smells bad,"im glad i got a top coat, but this smells horrible!!! i cant even describe it and it chips just the same without it dont get it"
3,"Not perfect, but ok","It chipped off within 2 days, but I always have that problem with nail polish unless I get them professionally done.I was HOPING that this would last longer because it's the brand that the nail salon uses, but no luck."
3,Not his best by miles,"Chili Palmer is a debt collector for the mob in Miami who travels via Las Vegas to Hollywood to recover an outstanding loan.While there he converts into a movie producer, meeting various Hollywood types along the way and puts together a script.This isn't one of Elmore's best, our hero is a bit too lucky and clever and there is not enough of the subtle violence that mark Leonard's finest. Tends to be boring actually.This book has been made into a movie, which is a movie about getting a movie made. Altogether too smart arsed."
5,One more to my Elmore Leonard collection.,"I am a huge fan of Elmore Leonard and have wanted to read this book for ages, since I've watched the movie a couple of times. Love it, absolutely love it and highly recommend."
3,Too Hollywood for me,"Get ShortyMaybe it was the movie?The bad guy gets the movie star and goes straight in a crooked way?Unexpected moves and plot twists that are poetic justicemake this novel very strange, yet likable.Elmore Leonard is a plot master who seems to have humor and understand hard characters and hard ways.Most people don't like wise guys ( but love their style?)and we almost like Chilli Palmer by the end,but compared to earlier work this comes up shorty."
1,GOT BORING,I agree with all the one star reviews that this book lacks everything. I've read quite a few E. Leonard books and enjoyed most of them. This was his worst so far.
4,Get Shorty is one of Leonard's best.,"With the words, Look at me, Chili Palmer can throw a scare into anyone, whether dry cleaner on the run, a derailed movie producer or a movie star. As Chili tries to make it into the movie business, the former loan shark runs into everything from crooked limo drivers, to actors and actresses, to a stupid mafia man with a grudge. Hilarious."
2,Why the fuss about Leonard?,"I read this after hearing a lot about Leonard, and how funny and clever his books supposedly are. Well, I tried this one and another (not sure what the other is called anymore, think it's Glitz) and did not find much that was funny or clever in them. In fact, I found both books rather dull and contrived, and think I am probably being generous by giving it two stars. Maybe I am just not a Leonard type of person."
2,Fun but laboured,"Having seen the film, I was hoping for a more snappy book. Get Shorty is a good read, but at times the plot and dialogue drag. If you have the staying power, it's amusing."
5,Elmore Does it again!!,Damn near impossable to top this one. Lenard does it again and proves that he is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century!!!!!! A must have.
4,"A cracking story with sharp characters, good action, and wit","This improbable story of a Miami two-bit hood who becomes a movie producer is full of sharp characters, snappy action, and witty dialog. As usual, Elmore Leonard works in the fringes of society where small-time hoods and citizens trying to scrape by rationalize the legal and moral implications of the choices they make to get what they want. This book is particularly amusing for its send-ups of Hollywood and the for the false machismo of Latin drug hustlers."
1,This is an advertisement for the book the movie the . . .,"Ever get the feeling that you are being sold something without even knowing it? Halfway through Get Shorty, I thought, well, SOMETHING AMAZING MUST BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN, because otherwise, this book is the most mundane, run of the mill paint-by-numbers crime novel ever written by a human or (I suspect) a computer. Ooooh, the Cuban man pronounces the F-word ""Fock."" How insightful! In a sense, I guess Leonard achieves the feat of mirroring in print the superficiality and semi-literacy of modern America. But with Dean Koontz still cranking out the page-burners, I'm not sure we need another reminder of our artistic bankruptcy. My recommendation is Don't Steal This Book."
2,Too typical,I am baffled by the hype that surrounded this book and its movie treatment. It's full of stock characters in nothing but stock situations
5,Just as decribed,"This is a beautiful hair clip. It was so pretty, I have wore it and is comfortable and got compliments on it. I put my hair in a bun and clip this around the bun and just dresses my hair up. I love this hair clip."
1,make another choice,"Despite Son Seals talent as a blues player, this Dvd does not reflect it. The shuffles are just OK. The instruction is lacking in detail and variety. If it's blues instruction you seek, try Duke Robillard's series on Freddie king or T bone walker. Ronnie Earl also has a great Dvd on blues styles as well. Save your $$"
1,Not Recommended,"I bought the Intex Quick-Fill electric pump - with hose. I lost the hose. I ordered a replacement hose from Intex direct, paying $6 for the hose and $6 for shipping. The hose doesn't fit the pump. Their policy? If I prepay the return freight, they may refund the ($6) price. How does this happen? The hose was ordered from the Intex Quick-Fill electric pump web page as a replacement part. Intex has not executed on a simple customer support need. For which I paid. Between product design and customer order fulfillment, they may have real issues. Of course, I am just a sample size of one. So I recommend y'all do a little customer satisfaction research and be sure to buy products from firms capable of meeting expected after sale support needs. But I have just added another name to my short list of manufacturers and distributors with which I will never again do business."
5,Quick Fill Electric Pump is a necessity for all inflatables.,I purchased the Quick Fill Electric Pump for my grandson's birthday. We gave him a Giga Ball and an inflatable jumping castle so the pump was necessary. It worked extremely well. The castle was inflated in a matter of minutes and was ready for jumping fun. I can't imagine inflating anything without it. It would also be great for filling a mattress or swimming pool.
5,Great pump!,This pump works great for both inflating and deflating. I have used it many times on large pool floats and my inflatable kayak with no problems. It's quick and makes no more noise than a small vacuum cleaner. I highly recommend this pump.
4,More Classic Govi,"The songs on this CD are stylisticly similar to Govi's previous release ""Seventh Heaven"". Two cuts are upbeat melodies and the rest are soft to medium. All are superbly played, in an understated complex style and (again) impeccably recorded. The low end bass notes reach the bottom depths of a good sound system without any hint of bloating or distortion and the clean, detailed, and balanced background percussion adds a beautiful sense of depth. On this CD Govi demonstrates a unique ability to tweek his music to stay fresh, while maintaining his classic sound. If this CD had one more high energy pulsating cut, I'd give it 5 stars. George M. -- Phx. AZ"
5,Superb guitar,This album is Govi at his best accompanied by a mesmerizing latin beat lightly spiced with musical flavors from around the world.
2,This stuff smells like urine!,"Not sure how good this product even works just yet... however, I do think people should be aware of the terrible scent of this. Can't believe they couldn't mask the urine type smell a little better. There is a great chance I won't even finish using it. I don't believe this product needs to smell this bad, the company should really do something about it.I'll do an update if I get myself to use it long enough to have an opinion on how it actually works. Not likely to make it that far though. We'll see.That's all for now."
2,Questions about each state - not America in general,"I didn't like this version very much. There are a few cards per state and questions about that state - a lot of not very common information. I thought it would be a lot of general questions about the United States and history, etc."
3,All a bit pointless really,nice production and ok to look at but the violence and odd love angle were all pointless.I had a problem feeling sympathy for someone who is in any way affilliated with cold blooded murder and sensless terrorism.Why would the hero feel anything but contempt for the dancer downstairs.
3,sound issues,"Although I enjoyed this movie, I believe the enjoyment was rooted in the potential of this film, rather than the actual finished product. The accents are heavy and most of the actors are soft-spoken, making it very difficult to hear everything that is being said. Also, there are several instances of Peruvian Indian dialect being spoken without subtitles offered to provide the audience insight into what is being said. Because this is a mystery/thriller, not being able to follow all the dialogue makes for an incomplete story and a frustrating experience as a viewer. If I could have understood 100% of the spoken story, I might have given this film 4-4.5 stars. As it is, it is not worth more than 3. Good luck!"
4,"Watch it, you will like it. Simple.","It has Garcia Marquzesque magic realism. Story is simple, but never straight forward. At some instances, few conclusions may become predictable to some audience. Yet, the poetic style carries the movie on. Although my expectation was higher, John Malkovich did good job. On a second thought, I think it's Javier Bardem's acting that has been the most powerful force for the movie. So 90% of the 4 stars above goes to him.Watch it, you will like it. Simple.:):)"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With a central mystery that never captivates the audience and a vacant performance by Javier Bardem in the lead, The Dancer Upstairs is a draggy and ho-hum political thriller that can be safely left on whatever shelf you find it."
3,"Entertaining, Yet Abridged","I got the feeling while watching this film that a good 30-45 minutes of worthwhile film ended up on the virtual cutting room floor. I never quite bought into the Captain's emotional attachment to the Dance teacher, and thought this was just one area that could have been flushed out a bit more. The film started out with a solid foundation and premise, but then seemed to rock-skip toward the end. I wish I had seen an extended version."
3,Good effort,"Malkovich made a worthy effort to carry this movie to the promised land but the script is the ship that allows you to reach the goal and this is the fault of this movie.The script lacks the dramatic continuity , you feel the ravishing presence of Javier Bardem , but a good cast doesn't garantee you a good result.The narrative web which supports the drama is fragile , and obviously the film results predictable at the end. Laura Morante makes a good work .Stunning visual locations."
5,The Dancer Upstairs,"Excellent movie! I had seen this movie before and wanted a copy for my personal collection. Many may think story moves too slow...in my opinion, not so. Excellent acting, directing, and story. If you enjoy Javier Bardem's work as an actor buy this movie, he does an excellent job making you believe his character."
1,A very disapointing movie...espically that ramiro jimenez,"first of all why is it called ""The Dancer Upstairs"" when the ballet teacher lives in the basement?second why do the spanish actors speak english. they cant even say their lines in proper english.third, what was up with all those poor dead dogs hanging everywhere?? peoples heads are blown off, i mean give me a break.fourth is when the mother is reading from index cards we cant see and speaking in eglish. the movie would have been more reealistic if it had english subtitles.fifth that ramiro jimenez he was just h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e. he should isnt good at anything...i used to know him. he is a teacher in ecuador. he wasnt even a good teacher. i had him for 4th grade and boy was he a horrible teacher."
1,Dancer Upstairs-Horrible movie.,This movie is very bad and boring. Ramiro Jimenez is a very bad actor and person...I know him.
2,An odd film really,"Why is the film called the dancer upstairs when the ballet teacher is downstairs? Because the revolutionary leader is seen dancing in the video the policeman views. Hence 'the dancer upstairs'. All happy now?Well, that depends on what you feel about a curate's egg. Malkovich is something of a aquired taste too, judging by the special features."
2,The Dancer Upstairs.,This film is too long and unnecessarily complicated to deliver a simple message. In the process it leaves the viewer tired in losing interest as one tries to make sense in what is being dished out piecemeal. A forgettable film.
2,Good performances but very slow movie,"Javier Bardem is an excellent actor. Films like ""Jamon Jamon"", ""Los huevos de oro"" and ""Before Night Falls"" are must see movies for his performance. But I have to criticise his English. He speak so bad that some times you don't understand what he is saying.And most of the time I imagine that he make an incredible effort to speak that affect his performance.For the movie that occur in an imaginary place with imaginary people I can say that John Malkovich with this debut promise a great future as a director. The film is real as well as the performances, not like most of the Americans detective's movies.In general it was worth watching but you have to be prepared because is very slow.I only recommend for futures releases that let the people speak their native language and put subtitles, it won't kill anyone."
2,Dissapointing,"I was disappointed by this movie. Although it has Laura Morante and Javier Bardem in it, and their acting is well done, the movie itself lacks so many things it I couldn't wait for it to be over. The film is slow, tedious and somewhat boring. Also, the plot is a bit confused and convoluted. The film fails to draw the viewer in and fails to tie many many things together. Several things are never explained which left me feeling confused and unable to better appreciate this movie. I just didn't like it much."
2,VERY WEAK,"Before I went to see this film I read the review and saw 3 1/2 stars out of four. I had to see it. Well, this was one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. What do we have there? A very good story, no cinematagraphy, terrible sound,and a very bad acting. Not much, I would say, for a movie. I was very disappointed. I don't think John Malkovich is ready to produce movies. He was not ready to be a good actor and now he is not ready to direct. I say two out of two."
4,Maybe,"The price is great, and keep in mind I am not much of a botanical whizzy, I ordered these to plant my extra seeds from my original ordering. My fault I didn't think ahead as to where to keep these in the meantime. So when they're wet and watered I have a mess. If you are raising from seed and need to keep these indoors until sprouts emerge, be sure you have a place that can endure the drippy leakage that is normal. They work great, which is why they drip well."
4,Superb Reference!,"An excellent reference. I haven't worked up to all-grain yet, but the wealth of information on yeasts, hops, styles, adjuncts, you name it, is golden! The recipes are, in my opinion, nearly useless as they seem to be culled from can labels and extract kits, have bad advice (as someone has already noted) that directly contradict Snyder's instructions, and often have bizarre or proprietary items in the list of ingredients. Marty Nachel's Dummies recipies are much better. Actually, the two books complement each other nicely.Best part of the book: the table of style components. Very handy for constructing a recipe; grain, extracts, water, yeast. Fabulous!"
4,Highly recommended,"Excellent; I refer to it more often than any other brewing book. There are perhaps three hundred partial extract recipes; a good detailed collection from around the world. The book starts with a history, then a description of ingredients and types of beers. The yeast and hop profile section is real good. There is a convenient brewing record evaluation form. There are Tips on all grain and decoction mashing. Yield probabilities are also very helpful. The back contains weights, measures and formulas. Highly recommended.Wish you wellScott"
2,"poorly organized, mostly recipes and reference tables","This book has a clever name, but is hardly the ""Brewmaster's Bible"" (unless he means to say you need FAITH to use this book to brew). Of its 400 pages, 300 are recipes. Much of the other 100 pages consists of reference tables, while only a few poorly organized sections explain concepts or tell how to brew.Better to get the Papazian book (for beginners) or Greg Noonan and Ray Daniels books (for advanced brewers)."
3,Not much of a Bible....,"This is a descent read, but pretty out dated compared to some of the other brewing books out there."
3,The Brewmaster's Bible,"Book is elementary, dated, and not useful for advanced brewers. Emphasis on extract recipes make this less useful to all-grain brewers."
4,Great book on homebrewing,This book helped me clarify many things I didn't quite understand about homebrewing and also tought me many new things. The recipe section has many interesting and not too hard to make beers but the other informative sections were most helpful.
4,An In depth guide to beer making,This book is well written and easy to follow and understand. This book covers all the different ways to brew beer along with recipes from some of the best brew masters around.
1,Not what I thought I was getting!,"I am very pleased with the bags themselves, as they are genuine Kirby bags and exactly what I needed. However, when I ordered this package, the description said ""15 Pack"". I've reviewed this several times to make sure it wasn't me that read incorrectly and it definitely was not. I tried sending an email to rectify the situation and received no response. I see that now they have changed the description, but just make sure that you are getting what you ordered. I found 3 packs much cheaper elsewhere (especially after shipping costs) and would not have ordered these had I known."
5,Punchin' Boy,"Jim Brown is an extremely original and unique writer and artist. I found Chappy to be a very interesting and adventurous young man, as well as Red Murphy. I found myself many times right there with them and feeling their emotions and the atmosphere of each incident. This is a book containing true life experiences that should never end; stories of two boys who never really wanted to leave the wonderous, exploritory years of adolesence and brotherhood. Best friends of this such should never lose touch with each other. The humor and wit is excellent - I've never laughed so hard in one chapter and then cried in the next. I look forward to Brown's next work of art. Best wishes to him and his publisher. This is a perfect example of growing up in the South where life was so free and innocent. Thanks Chappy for taking me home."
1,Like SPAM get this product,"This is not a good product. The graphics are fine however sign up for the free research and you learn you get nothing or very little for free. Most requests for info result is a request to join the pay service. By the way you need to sign up for the ""Free"" services and you will recieve weekly advertisments to upgrade, join, and a host of other things. I have sent them email to stop, yelled screamed; nothing works. It just keeps comming and comming. I was able to find all the information I got from their ""free"" service from independent searches. EVEN THE 10 CDs THEY PROVIDE USUALLY GET YOU A REQUEST TO JOIN THEIR PAID SERVICE. The basic product isn't bad but not at the price and the constant SPAM really ticks me off..I GET ENOUGH JUNK MAIL!"
5,Great Books,This is the third book of this line we have. Everyone is better than the last. I highly recommend these fantastic books!
5,Great fundraiser for a school!,This was a great CD and fundraiser for Karen's alma mater. She could recreate if for you HS as a fundraiser.! Contact Karen Sokolof Javitch via [...]
3,Quick synopsis on reading theory,"If you're looking for a book that briefly summarizes reading theory, and the rationale behind teaching phonemic awareness (etc.) - this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book that includes activities to help you turn theory into practice, you might be better off with other publications."
3,"Good stopping power, annoying squeak.","No clue where these are manufactured, no where did it say on the box, I don't like that.These work well for stopping My K5 Jimmy, but squeak from time to time. No wear sensors.The manufacturer's catalog incorrectly listed the part # for an S-15, so the first one's I received were wrong."
3,The motives behind the man,"This book was written under commission from the war effort as an attempt by a psychiatrist to try to shed some light from the sparse knowledge that was available about Hitler, his background and his early years. Unlike the scruples that MD's tipically have when expressing clinical views about their experience and their patients, the war effort justified some daring and what would seem today wild projections from sparse and fragmented data. Notwithstanding, history as later evolved lent credence to Dr. Langer's findings and this book is a fascinating exploration of the very soul of a troubled mind that explains some very obscure attitudes and reactions of its subject."
5,Best Controller for PC,I bought this controller 4 month ago and it works fineIts best controller for PCBuild quality is very good!!!
5,Perfect,"After struggling to get AC2 on computer to agree with the wireless controller, this product was a relief. After plugging it in, it immediatly downloaded it's driver and updates from windows seven.Thank you windows, works perfectly."
1,Do yourself a favor - get the wired version,"This controller is great, but the wireless receiver is terrible. It stopped working within days. Turns out that it's a widespread issue. The fuse in this thing blows quickly and stops working. Getting a warranty replacement from Microsoft's customer service is a 1 month process.Save yourself the headache - get the wired receiver."
1,I've tried everything,I downloaded the drivers for Vista 32bit (my PC)I downloaded and set up xpadderI replaced batteries.. twice.The game on my PC that I'm trying to connect with is Assassin's Creed.All the lights on the controller and receiver function as advertised.I get absolutely no response in the game to my wireless controller. The only good thing I've experienced is the speed with which the vendor got this product to me.
1,"Stopped working after a month, very widespread issue...","There is a huge problem with these wireless receivers, they simply stop working because the F1 fuse gets blown. Ive heard of it blowing by taking it in and out of the USB port for every use, but also by people who have left it plugged in the entire time they've had it. I was so happy when I got it and it worked great, then all of the sudden my computer stops recognizing it and the green light doesnt light up when I plug it in. Nothing can fix it short of opening it up and soldering the fuse manually which is a bad idea. I regret buying this and wouldnt recommend it."
1,"Bought 2 of them, both wireless receivers broke within days","I bought two of these from another retailer. Both wireless receivers stopped functioning in 4 days and now I'm forced to go back and use my old wired controllers on my PC. The controllers still work with a 360, but that isn't the point of buying one for the PC, is it?On a side note, this makes 4 out of 5 Microsoft wireless products that have died on me."
4,Solid controller,Pros:- Solid construction- Several controllers can be synced to the same receiver- Interchangeable with xbox 360 controllers- Good wireless rangeCons:- No way to turn off the controller without pulling the battery- Compatibility issues between DirectInput and Xinput means rumble function is absent for older games.- Driver updates are lacking
4,I needed the,"reciever and I got this because it has a controller with it. It took a little while to find configuration software (switchblade), and I had to pay a tiny $1.99 per month fee to use the most recent version. But after I got it all set up, I really liked it. I don't have to hurt my wrist on the mouse when I play my game."
1,Buyers beware,"This is a great controller for PC gaming. There is one major problem I must let you know before buying it. The reciever is a piece of garbage, the hardware is almost defective. If you are lucky like me, the receieve will work for at least 4 months, but some will die within a week! The reciever's green light will not turn on anymore therefore making the controller dead too. You might want to keep your warranty."
2,we have to unplug our whole house to get it to connect,"Ok maybe not the whole house but still... the controller conflicts with our pre-existing sets of mouse/keyboard combos. Once we run around unplugging those and rebooting the machine it works fine, but that is certainly not worth the effort."
5,Console Envy,"OK... so I don't have a console, but I do have a decent computer with a good graphics card. Now I can play many of my favorite games without having to mash on a keyboard. Well worth the money. You can also use it with an Xbox 360 down the road if you feel the need. Communications seem to be very reliable and the drivers / setup was very easy."
2,Microsoft drivers are lame...,"For those of you that know gamepads, the drivers that MS includes with the gamepad won't allow you to change the triggers (showing it as a ""Z"" axis) to buttons. So, if you like newer games that have support for this gamepad then go ahead and buy it (because the triggers will work with ""Games for Windows"" games!) but for older games you will not have the luxury of assigning commands to the triggers...but there is 3rd party software (yes, 3rd party because MS is to cheap to offer better drivers) for the wired 360 controllers to make the triggers as buttons.I also had to get Service Pack 1 for Vista 64-bit to make the controller work (I have a Logitech G5 mouse and it caused driver conflicts)."
2,XBox Controller Apparently Not Compatible With Older Games,"I bought this last week hoping to play some older PC games I have like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 & Need for Speed Underground (the original).Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get this device to work with either game yet. I believe it has something to do with how Windows recognizes the controller. It works fine in Crysis and probably works well with contemporary titles."
5,Great Item,"It's my 2nd xbox 360 remote.I bought this one because I thought my first one (black) was messing up because I have it for the past 3years, but I figured out that I just had to change the rechargeable battery.My advice is,don't waste money buying those AAA battery even though they will last you for month,and month,and probably many months after that.Just get a rechargeable battery,you won't regret it.so I barely use that one,and went back to my old controller.Didn't feel like returning it.it's a good investment, specially when a challenger tries you in a game that you masterize."
3,"Great Controller -- too many conflicts, though.","I won't waste words reiterating that which so many others have already said regarding the great performance of this controller. We've all played an Xbox, we all know that Microsoft knows how to make computer components.Here's the rub: you literally cannot use any other wireless devices (bluetooth is fine) at the same time. Even using my Wacom tablet (the tablet itself uses a USB cable connection ... but the pen itself is wirelessly sending info to the tablet) renders the controller confused and utterly unable to find the receiver, even when scant inches from said component.Seems a bit busch league to me, but on the bright side: i don't often need to use my tablet and the controller at the same time. if it weren't for the fact that rebooting is the only way to reset the coupling, I wouldn't mind at all."
3,USB Power is an issue,"This product works fine in Windows XP Vista and 7. I have moved it from computer to computer and the drivers always work. The only issue I have with it, which is reported by many people, is that you have to be sure the usb port provides enough power to get the RF transceiver to work. On my main PC for instance it will not work from the front panel headers, only the rear USB ports which I can specify to receive more power in BIOS. I generally am not a fan of M$ but I concede that this is the best PC controller you can get if you play games for Windows, several of which only support XBox 360 controllers made by Microsoft. I would bet this is because games now get written for the 3 major platforms (360 PS3 and PC) at the same time, and additional controllers are an afterthought. I sure wish Sony would release a similar bundle for a PS3 controller that worked with PC, because a PS3 controller is easier on the hands."
5,Can anyone help?,Has anyone gotten this product to work with Call of of Duty 4? This seems like the best controller out on the market right now and I want to get COD4 but some people are saying it doesnt work on COD4. Can someone help me out?
1,Issues from the start...,"Took over 30 minutes to get the controller recognized after install, then the controller wouldn't even work. All four lights blinked constantly and dropped connection from the receiver within seconds syncing. Once again, MS has proven that they have no real R&D;/QA.Waste of money and time is what this product is. Would not recommend to anyone."
2,xbox 360 controller for windows,"Most uncomfortable controller I've ever handled. I don't hate the triggers as much as the two buttons above them. They're really awkward to try to reach. I don't know why these peripheral designers don't take advantage of the hand's natural placement on the controller and put buttons under the right and left hand middle fingers. Notice the placement of your hands when grabbing the controller; buttons under your middle fingers instead of on top of your index fingers would be so much more comfortable. Anyway, I'm selling this one on ebay. I don't ever use it. I thought it would be better than my Saitek but alas..."
1,this thing broke,well it worked once and then broke. i would rather pay the extra $30 for one at best buy that won't break so easy. first time buying off amazon and not so happy with it
1,"I ordered this for a friend, he never received it.","I ordered this for a friend, he never received it.Sincerely,Ira Carmel."
4,"A great product, but a bit costly","The best controller for dual systems. Great wireless reception. could have been bluetooth wireless, but oh well. Kills battery's fast. I use it for all games on my pc and 360. Easy to set up and install. 2.4ghZ bad because in my house I have a lot of 2.4ghZ products using the same frequency. As usual Microsoft trys to rip off customers by making everything expensive. So close to buying a wired controller... overall its a good product."
1,"It might have been nice, had it worked.","I bought this for 30 dollars, expecting something good. I bought the kind with the rechargeable battery, and I bought it used from someone with high ratings. when it arrived, it came with only the software and the controller. The software installed just fine, but there was no charging device. On top of that, it never had any battery power to start with. so now, I'm stuck with a powerless xbox 360 wireless controller for windows that doesn't work. coincidentally, they don't sell individual chargers for the kind that works with the computer. I wasted 30 bucks on this and now they want me to buy another one for the same price??"
4,360 wireless controller,"ok I bought the controller to play rainbow six vegas but it doesn't work with the game. but it does work with Halo 2 and it makes everything much easier I would recomended. but sometiimes when I'm going to turn it on it doesn't want to connect and I have to put the computer to sleep or log off or restart it for it to work. other than that it a great controller. (long range) i mean long. (my PC is in one room but I play with the controller in another room. I have a 25' cable running from the pc to a 42"" HDTV. in the living room. (haven't lost connection yet)"
3,Used to work fine,"So when I first got this it worked perfectly fine, setup and everything was a cinch. However, when I moved back to school, I can't get it to connect with the receiver, I try resetting it and the green circle spirals around the ""quadrants"" and then just blinks. I think it could be because of the wireless routers in apartments in the area. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,Very short life,"My experience was the same as soem of the other one star reviews, worked fairly well for a few months, and then died. Not worth the price, I would not reccomend this at all!"
1,Horrible string,"Since I make friendship bracelets, I buy all kinds of string and I have been looking for some string like this for years and i thought i would try it out, I made 3 bracelets with is and the string we all fraying, like crazy. I was going to return these but I am not going to waste my time. This was a bad buy."
4,TWISTED TWINE,THE PRODUCT IS FINE...I WISH YOU CARRIED #36 TWINE...I USE IT TO MAKE ROSARIES...THE TWINE I BOUGHT FROM YOU WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED BUT I CAN USE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE..THANKS FOR YOUR SPEEDY DELIVERY
2,What A Mess,"Pretty colors, but it all unraveled way too easy and become unmanageable. I don't usually throw things away but I did throw this stuff away."
1,I threw it in the trash can after I watched it!,"I listened to Pitney in the early 60's when he was popular. I have his greatest hit CD. When I saw this DVD, I was very anxious to see it. When you listen/watch any nostalgic music, most of us prefer to listen to the tunes that were sang in the old way, not revised versions that usually turn me off. I have two big issues with this DVD. One, his voice is not the same as before, unlike some other singers, such as Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka, etc, who never really lost their voice. In addition, the arrangement of songs were terrible! When you have a combination of these two deficiencies, what's left to listen to? It is really the worst nostalgic performance I have ever listened. I just can't fathom some reviews gave it high ratings! There is just no way that I will ever want to listen to it again, so I threw in the garbage can where it belongs."
3,Too little technical detail,"I found the relationships among the toolmakers interesting and was impressed by the author's assertion that by about 1850 leadership in tool making had passed to American workers. Unfortunately, there was too much emphasis on the relationships and too little on the details of the inventions and the techniques used in them. I understand that Maudsley used some very ingenious techniques to ""bootstrap"" accuracy from relatively inaccurate lead screws when making more accurate screws. That was not discussed. I am sorry to say that this is not a good book for those of us hungry to learn just how things were done in earlier times and how techniques evolved."
3,Early Jorge Ben,"Before Jorge Ben became the Funkmeister of world music he was a traditional Sambalero. This early work ib very Bossa Nova, featuring a jazzy quintet, Ben's writing [after all he first became famous as a songwriter with hits like Mas Que Nada for Sergio Mendes], and a crooning pop music singing style. It was to be years before he started to make that tangy Brazilian stew so reminisent of a concert mix like Dr. John-Kool and the Gang and Talking Heads. This is more a historical document than it is a particularly Funky recording."
3,Very big and heavy,"I was hoping this would be smaller than the other rigid coiled bike chains I have, but it ended up being bigger and much heavier."
1,"crappy lock, do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",i have had this lock in the past and it sux beacause if u leave it in the rain it gets rusted and barely worx in fact i had to throw mine out it got so rusted plz do not buy this product it really sux.
1,The CD is garbage!,"The last CD they came out was Bangin but this one is just garbage,and a waste of money.I would've been better of buying an old Fat Boys CD.Believe me,don't waste your money like i did!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,It did not meet any of the expectations I had. I don't want to say its horrible because we are huge Lil Boosie fans but I nor my 14 yr old never play this one.
5,Perfect for little hands,"These little maracas are perfect for little hands, and you can't beat the price! We purchased one for my daughter's 2nd birthday (along with a bunch of other instruments) and it's the perfect size for her. Even though the price is cheap these are very well made - very sturdy and have a great, solid sound and it feels very solid in your hand, not like cheap light plastic. I definitely recommend this if you have little ones who like to make music."
4,very small maraca but my son likes it,"Maybe I failed to read every detail about this item, but I was expecting to get an average size Maraca in the mail. When I opened the package, it was very very small lol. I was disappointed but only because I didn't double check the size. Overall its a good product though, my son enjoys it and that's all that matters :)"
2,Okay,"These are much tinier than expected. About the size of a deck of playing cards..So, while fun for baby to play with make sure you aren't expecting a 'real' maraca."
1,STAY CLEAR: this toy is a health hazard!,"I was given a green one of these by my brother and his wife as a gift. My son (then 6 months) was very fond of it. However, after a few weeks, he was doing his usual thing of mouthing it when we noticed it leaking black gunk. Needless to say, we immediately stopped him playing with it. I have no idea what the gunk was but I guess his saliva had interacted with whatever is inside it. Who knows if it's toxic?? Thankfully, he was fine. I will be contacting the manufacturer of this item of course."
3,Overpriced but fun,"For the price I assumed we would get three, considering that products like ""Basic Beat Small Chiquitas"" are selling for a pair for around 3-4 bucks. This item was way too overpriced, but was good. Is it better than the cheaper brands? I doubt it. Its a moderately cheap piece of plastic that you can buyer cheaper elsewhere. Save your money and buy from someone else. The only reason to buy these ones is because you may like the design....but the shipper cant even guarantee color."
4,shake shake shake,"I thought there would be 2 in the order, but only 1 comes, which is little bummer. overall she still has fun with just one."
3,"Great mini instrument, but overpriced","I bought 2 of these for my 16 month old, and she loves them. However, it is overpriced from this vendor. I found them elsewhere for $3.50 each."
3,Nice sound but a bit expensive,"My infant daughter plays with a similar shaker in her playgroup and liked it so much we wanted one for our home. This has the ridged texture she likes to chew, and a nice mild sound, but for a little chunk of plastic, I would have expected twice the shakers or half the price. It would also be nice to have two shakers because the parent could model its use for the child. Be aware that this is sized to fit in the hand of a child anywhere from 5-6 months on up, so it's very petite."
3,"Good product, but picture is deceving","I paid little attention to the product name ""Single Maracito"" ... my bad.While quality seems VERY GOOD, it is a bit over priced for a single item."
2,Nice but only one,In the picture it shows three and when I got one I was disappointed. It's good quality but basically paying five dollars for one little maraca. Had I got two at least for the price I would have been happy .
3,Polk Bros. Santa wishes you a Merry Christmas,"Okay companion to the Ultra Lounge Christmas discs. A few things here you won't find anywhere else including the roller rink version of ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" by organist Marlowe Morris. That track was originally on the Columbia LP ""Jingle Bell Jazz"" but was dropped when it was reissued on CD. People who grew up in Chicagoland in the 1960s might recognize the Santa on the CD cover-it's a Polk Bros. Santa like many people had years ago. Polk Bros. was an appliance store and offered these Santas (or a Snowman in 1962 or 1963) free if you spent $30 or, in 1963 at least, $5 with most purchases. The figures were Vacucell-two molded halves stapled together- and were made by the L.A. Goodman Mfg. Co. of Chicago."
3,expectations not as expected,the collection looked better than I actually thought it was - I loved traditional pop but had not heard of some of these people and that wound up being what I did not like about the CD
2,What was it they were thinking?,"This is one of the worst holiday grouping you will ever buy, just to own one of the most treasured gems I have in my 4,000 + music collection. Sergio Mendes & Brazill 66, doing Mel Torme's ""The Christmas Song"" is one of the most unbelievable versions you will ever hear. The fact they omitted it in the review, yet thankfully made it auditionable, will prove my point. The whole version of this gem by the second Brazil will be your first pick for decades!! Throw the rest away! Incidently Johnny Mandel is the arranger!"
1,Do not buy this product!,"I bought this boombox in pink for my daughter's nursery but did not start using it until she was 3 months old (and far beyond the 90 day warranty). It worked for about an hour and then the cd player completely stopped working. Save your money, do not buy this product!"
4,very good material,if you like the dance you need this material...if you like the experimental films and avangard ... you need to
5,Excellent Book for an Excellent Price,"This book comprehensively and completely covers all topics of advanced Algebra, and allows the reader to fully understand both the basics of Trigonometry, as well as enlighten him/her on some advanced topics in this field. It is well-written, with excellent example problems, (Called ""Try-This"" Problems), that allow the reader to test his/her knowledge of a topic or sub-topic before advancing to the actual problems. Overall, this is an excellent reference source, and one that I will continue to use throughout my life as an authoritative review of this subject. I would recommend it to anyone who has the will to learn!"
1,There are better live traps out there,"The mice trip the door, but somehow don't get caught inside. It is also impossible to clean.We also tried these:- Catchmaster 606MC Mechanical Metal Multi-Catch Trap -- the mice go in, eat the peanut butter, poop, and go right back out. We tried messing with the ramps to get them to operate better, but no luck.- Victor Mice Trap from Home Depot -- we had a lot of success with this. It catches the mice, and allows for cleaning.- Victor Mini Sonic PestChasers from Home Depot -- we seem to be getting a benefit from these. Try them.- Mice Cube 4 Pk - Reusable Humane Mouse Trap -- these work great at catching mice, but are impossible to clean out."
5,thanks,"From time to time I think everyone gets a visit from a little creature. Well, one came to visit me and though I wanted rid of it, I did not want to harm it. After all Mice are food for others that I would prefer not to have a little visit from. This is a sure thing trap. Bait the tunnel with the most pungent cheese that any mouse could hardly refuse, and very soon thereafter you will have caught the bugger and have it safely inside the trap for easy release at a far away destination of your choice. It's a wonderful invention..."
4,Tip-Trap Mouse Trap,"I've tried several different traps,and this is the most fool proof of any I've used. When the door is shut nine times out of ten there is a mouse inside. Releasing the mouse is easy and a jet of hot water is all that is needed for clean up."
5,It Only Took 2 Hours,"Such a simple trap but boy does it work. We've had a little visitor in our kitchen for a couple of weeks now and as much as we've wanted him gone we just didn't have the heart to kill him. I set up the trap on our counter between our stove and toaster, baited it with a dab of peanut butter and went to watch TV with my son. A few hours later my son walked into the kitchen and told me the door to the trap was closed. I thought that maybe the door closed accidently but nope, trapped inside was our sneaky little friend. We walked him outside and set him free. I hope my neighbor enjoys him as much as we did. I've rebaited the trap and set it up again just in case our mousey little invader has family and friends."
4,It works !,"It works as advertised. The device itself is very simple. I had a really clever mouse which has been dodging ""Mice Cube"" traps for sometime. It got caught in this. A couple of reasons for 4 stars instead of 5.1. There is no way to tell if there is a mouse inside or not. I had to shake the thing to feel the mouse inside. They should put a clear plastic atleast on one side to easily view.2. The design of the system is as such that if the mouse pushes or gets on top of the trap, it will trip without catching anything. So the mouse has to pass through the gate (see picture) for it to work. When I was setting it up, that's what I was afraid of. Fortunately the mouse did not get on top of it and got caught as expected."
1,doesn't work for me,"I have this trap and the have a heart trap. I've caught lots of mice with the have a heart one, zero with this one."
1,too small,and flimsy. there was no way a mouse was going to fit in there or get past the nosing around stage.
3,This is why the reviews aren't great,"I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap; just couldn't bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house. I posted a picture; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill. I found that I was ""waiting up"" and checking the mousetrap every half hour, because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there. A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap. I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes."
1,wasn't very effective.,"I was using them outside along the base of the back of the house would faces woods. Tired these out of curiosity and would not have known had I not tried them. I found others more effective, but I wouldn't purchase these again. I can't comment as to their effectiveness inside, as mentioned earlier, I used them outside."
2,Balancing act,"I bought only one of these on Amazon and bought two similar but much better traps from Lowes. The problem with this trap is that once you load the end up with PB it kicks the whole thing over causing the trap to close. The traps bought at Lowes (also sold on Amazon) have a box over the top that helps to prevent the trap from self closing prematurely. The Lowes bought traps caught eight mice in one night. Also if you choose this one, careful not to let the mice stay inside for too long. Their fur becomes wet and they don't survive for long with wet fur and cold weather. I left my captured mice inside for the night to dry out and then released them 1/4 mile away. Hopefully some of them made it through the night at -5F and no snow. I really don't think I'm doing anything but causing the animals more pain and suffering, but to appease the softer hearted family members they are being let go outside where mother nature can have her way with them."
2,Not work for me,"I set three traps in the basement. One is pushed away and closed, but did not catch the mouse. For two others, the mouse some how took the bait out and ran away."
1,Missing parts,This item arrived with the end piece missing. Cannot be used without it. I don't even know how to make a claim about this item.
5,Caught My Mouse Within Hours,"We have had a mouse problem for weeks. WELL NO MORE! Within hours of setting the trap out, baited with a tiny amount of peanut butter, our tiny perpetrator was caught and put in a critter keeper. This machine works like a charm, and catches them every time. I am so glad no more little thieves will be getting into our dogfood for the summer season, and we'll seal up all the holes in the meantime. Great product!"
4,Works like a charm,These work like a charm. I bought the mostly transparent mouse traps with the one way doors and my mice don't go near them. This one catches a mouse every time.
3,BEWARE: the blue and yellow brand similar to this is poorly made,"I bought mousetraps of a different brand to this but a similar design:they are called ""Better mouse trap"" and have a yellow door and a blue body.While they DO work, the problem is that they are VERY poorly made.* One failed from the start: the door wouldn't close properly because it was just poorly made* One stopped working because the very flimsy plastic catches that keep the door closed wore down just a little- I expect this will happen to most of them after just a few months of use* The other broke when I dropped itThat particular brand catches mice, but they are SHAMEFULLY badly made.Just for the record I am not associated with this 'Kness tip-trap' product, but just wanted to warn people about the other one ~ also in the hope that the publicity will make that other manufacturer 'mend their ways' of manufacture!I'm actually trying one of the steel box traps - and will report back if I can!"
2,Be sure to check the trap everyday or mouse will die.,So I just want to put a warning out there that if you use this product please check the trap twice a day. I went out of town for just two days and when I returned and checked the trap later in the day I found it had caught the mouse (been about 1-1/2 weeks-was excited!) BUT that the little mouse was dead. When I emptied him out by a field-not sure if he was dead or not until i opened the box--a little sweaty mouse fell out. He must have died from a heart attack? It was pretty traumatic since we didn't want to kill the mouse. So yes product works but there should be instructions about being able to check the trap at least once a day. =(
1,It didn't work.,"The mouse got in and out on it's own, each time. I don't know how. Trap is too flimsy I guess, or the mouse is too big."
2,Can't See if Mouse is In There!!,"This little trap works really well catching small mice, but I have found it quite difficult sometimes to tell if a mouse is even in there! The mice are pretty small where we are and can weigh next to nothing! I have made the mistake of thinking the trap got tripped by mistake, opening it up thinking it's empty, and had a big surprise!! I am trading these guys in for see-through traps."
4,humane but tippy,"Baited with peanut butter, and accompanied by some patience, these traps really work. They have a tendency to tip on their own, so require an extra lot of checking. But we have managed to capture dozens of mice, one at a time, by setting these traps in their paths. You must check the trap at least daily, to ensure that your mouse has not expired. But for those interested in catch-and-release, it's an easy method to catch them, and provide the mouse with a nice final meal before relocation."
1,Too small for my needs,"Ok, you guys got me. From the picture, and from the ""shipping weight 1 lb"", and from the phrase ""rat and mice bait"", I expected something larger. This trap is incredibly small. Arrives in a small envelope ! It is less than 1.5 inches square and 6.5 inches in length.No way will it catch the monster of a mouse/rat that I saw in my backyard. I think it is a little disingenuous that the dimensions are not revealed. Returning it."
2,Not effective,"I tried this trap for 10 days without sucess. I followed the instructions, but the trap was tipped every day without capturing any mice. Good theory but not executed very well."
1,Too small,"I'm in Arizona and we have pocket mice here. They are very small but would not enter this trap. I think it's too confined and needs to be twice the width and height. There's barely any room for a mouse to turn around in there, so they don't go in since it's a dead end. Maybe Pocket Mice are smarter than the average mouse. I used peanut butter and sunflower kernels for bait. I moved the trap around too to different places, no luck."
1,"Not joking, my mouse dragged it away.","We don't have any experience with mouse, mice, rats, etc. This is our first! When this product arrived, we were shocked as too how small it was. I've seen our resident mouse, and it doesn't look like he can fit into this thing. We bought two of it and placed them both out anyway. Sure enough, we caught nothing, further more, we were scratching our head as to what happened to one of them. It was gone! We thought someone in the family just moved it around and misplaced it. Well, today we decided to dig further and cleaned out our garage. We found one of his hide-outs. He wasn't home, but we found an orange, our dog's brush which is now all chewed up, and yep, one of the mouse traps. It was all chewed up as well and there was a note... It said, ""Is this all you got?"""
2,Super Mouse,"So disappointed. It worked some of the time but lately i couldn't figure out why the bait was eaten, the trap was closed and there was no mouse to be found. Realized it knawed through the plastic. I'm going for metal next time."
2,Didn't work for me,"This trap is such a clever design, I really wanted it to work. But, what can I say? It didn't catch my mouse. I gave it almost two weeks before I bought D-Con. I know a lot of people had great luck with it, but it just didn't work for me."
4,Simple but effective,"I agree with others that when brand new, it tends to want to close up when lightly jarred. However,it loosened up fairly quickly when worked a few times. So far, I have caught two mice with it. I felt bad because on the second one, I think it's leg still managed to get hurt a bit when the trap closed. In general, it is humane which is what I wanted."
2,Tail gate protector,This product was returned with no problems. This item is in two pieceswhich is shown as one piece. It was replaced with a comparable Dee Zee tailgate protector.
1,These do not work!,"These earplugs are completely ineffectual. I purchased them to wear while sleeping, but they are extremely uncomfortable and do not block out any noise at all. They do not fit well in the ear canal and actually hurt my ears while I had them in. I had wanted to stay away from the foam earplugs that you have to roll to place in your ear, but the foam ones are much more comfortable and effective than these. I'm very disappointed in my purchase - especially since I now have a box of 100 useless earplugs."
1,They do not serve the purpose,"I got tired of old-fashioned roll-in-your-fingers earplugs, so these sounded like a good idea. Shove'em in and pull'em out. The problem is, the plastic insert is just too short to be grabbed easily with your fingers.And that's not even the worst part. They just don't block out the noise. All other earplugs are made of some kind of a sound deafening materials, similar to memory foam. Not these. These earplugs are made of very thin rubber (no other sound deafening material is used) with that short plastic rod inside. The manufacturer missed its mark by a mile.If you are looking for comfortable earplugs with the great noise blocking ratings, I would recommend Howard Leight MAX-1 Foam Ear plugs Uncorded NRR33. I hope this helps."
1,Such a good band gone bad...,"I agree with the others out there who loved Wakefield's first album, ""American Made"". I think it was very well done and though it isn't anything spectacular or a new sound they were very genuine and just sounded like they loved what they did. Their music was infectious and they had a great sound. I too was excited to get part two of this with ""Which Side Are You On"" but was sorely dissappointed in the album. I barely made it through it once because its so bland. Don't get me wrong, I still love Wakefield, but I hope that they get their old sound back. If you love Wakefield, you may be dissappointed by this, but choose as you will, just be careful not to pot too much hope in this album."
3,What happened to wakefield?????,"I wanted to rate this cd 2 and half stars, but there is no option for it. Ill admitt i fell for Wakefield's first album even though it sounded like every other pop-punk band in existence at the time. What did me in was seeing them open for the All-American Rejects, for me there is no substitute for a great live show. After heavy rotation in my cd collection i couldnt wait to see what wakefield had in store for an encore, i was very disappointed. there are only brief hints of the Wakefield of old, this cd is like listening to a whole new band. Wakefield lost all of its pep, hooks, and it seems their heart when making ""Which Side are you On."" It seems to me that the song ""Sell Out"" off the last album was not just a fun and catchy song, but a prelude to what would soon become Wakefield's way of life. If you are a fan of Wakefield, buy this disc at your own risk, I did and am very disappointed."
1,"Back off biatch, you don't know me","...who...was...it...that said ""you never miss a good thing until it's gone""...i don't know...but they weren't talking about wakefield. I was ready to never hear anything from this band again, and like it!...then they came out with ""which side are you on?""...why?...does anyone even listen to this horrible band?...do you?...why?...don't answer that, *i don't wanna know*...but if you listen to this garbage...and call...yourself...a music fan...you don't deserve life on god's green earth...wakefield broke up, by the way...and ya know what?...i don't miss em'...you never miss a good thing until it's gone...goodbye wakefield."
5,Best work she's put out in a while!!!!,She has really improved since her break. You can play these songs over and over again and not get tired of it. Great job LeAnn!!!! Keep up the great work and continue making great music!!!!
2,"""LeAnn Rimes: BIG DEAL"" It's no Big Deal, really...","Another single by LeAnn Rimes. It really isn't a big deal. Sounds like your average modern country, song just new. Sure, her vocals are good but its still too similar to other songs. This is just my opinion."
5,Finally...A Marketing Bible For Women!!!!!,"Testosterone Free Marketing is a true page turner and a must read for women and MEN alike! Before TFM, I knew my style was different, but I what I did not know was that it is perfectly normal. Women are not as `cut throat' in their approach, like many in our male-dominated business world. The one thing I learned is that there can be a harmony between the marketing styles of women and men. From this point forward I am no longer going to downplay my skills and abilities. I am going to toot my horn and love every minute of it!"
5,Great movie,I thought the movie was great. Good fighting and good storyi highly recommend this movie for all old skool kung fu fans
1,What a Disgrace Of A Film...; Cheng Sing Shortchanged.,"I Totally Disagree With The First Reviewer's Comment...; This Flick Is a Disgrace To True Wholesome Martial Arts. How Could They Put Cheng Sing With Bruce Lai In The Same Flick...?! It Doesn't Make Sense, Cheng Sing Has Been Shortchanged In Doing This Film. Besides, I Cannot Bare To Watch Bruce Lai, Period....! He Disgust Me ! Anyways, This Is Not A Good Movie And I Wouldn't Recomend Anyone Even Attempting To Buy It. It's Subtitiled, And The Original Language Is Chinese, Which Makes It Even More Boring. Ugh.....!!!"
2,Lacking outstanding track selection,"as always, the dutchman comes through with quality mixxing talent. unfortunately for me, i felt there was a lack for outstanding musical selection. i didnt feel like there were any outstanding tracks... nothing with a unique and outstanding rhythm. i like progressive mixes, but i have to say this mix didn't progress to anything outstanding."
3,NO where close to seamless,"This is my first time really ""listening"" Sander K's CD. I guess my expectation was too high, and I ended up disappointed. It's no where close to seamless, and not smooth neither.I gave it 3 stars because I like his song selections. I think trak 7 to 10 were OK!!"
3,Not Quite,"I had to check out some of Sander Kleinenberg's commercial releases on labels other than Global Underground and Renaissance. I never liked his hard techno and progressive trance sets, but after listening to disc 1 of his Nubreed album and both discs of Renaissance Presents Everybody I wanted to find more releases where he focuses primarily on mixing tracks from house genres.This album is no where near the caliber of sets featured on the three discs mentioned above. Sure the set falls under a progressive house album, but it has the feel of his live sets where he mixes a lot of hard progressive trance tracks that tend lack of depth. Very mediocre track selection on this one.3/5 stars for this effort."
2,Ok,This mix is okay. Not as progressive as other Sander K releases. The track selection isn't all that great. Comando Heaven is probably the best track.
1,Poor People's Steve Reich,"My CD of this pop-minimalist, actually, contained two discs: the first resp. the last Ph. Glass CD I'll ever hear in my life. Try Steve Reich's Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ instead - the peak of this (overrated) style.Klaus"
1,Painful,"In a word: Excruciating. In two words: Mind numbing. This guy raised monotony to a new art form... kind of. Think of it as Manheim Steamroller with its scant amount of life and energy removed. Each piece (using the term liberally) features a very simple minded rhythmic contrast, like triplets on top of half notes, and then prolongs this elementary school exercise for anywhere from 4 to 7 minutes. To do it justice, let's call them days. On some of his more advanced works, Glass even splurges by laying a pathetic, uninteresting melody on top of the syncopated Chinese water torture already in progress. Two of the pieces were absolutely unbearable. I was forced to skip to the next number like a fox chewing off its leg. Despite the mood it had created, the album did mercifully come to an end. I don't ever recall looking forward to the end of a CD with quite the same fervor and spiritual longing."
1,Wish I could return it,"Heard a small bite on NPR, and thought I'd try the CD. Wish I didn't. The small bite was the best part. The rest is, at best, repititious. Don't know Glass's composing history, but I'd hope that this was not the peak for him."
3,A disappointment,"While many other Philip Glass's albums (such as Koyaanisqatsi, The Photographer or his collaboration with Ravi Shankar, Passages) are carefully assembled wholes, I found Glassworks somewhat tedious and lacking in inspiration.The album was repetitive. Don't get me wrong - repetition is one of his trademarks. By repetition I mean that many of the songs were mere two-chord wonders, and the closing song was almost identical to opening one. None of the songs invoked too strong feelings. I got the impression that this album was just whipped together, with not much effort, out of leftovers.This is an item for a Philip Glass collector only."
4,Philip Glass,"He is amazing, not to mention the hottest thing on the punk scene. His stage performance is said to make A G.G Allin show look like something you would see on Saturday mornings. All the people who claim ""punk is dead"" need to check out Philip Glass and his musical expression that could only be consider ""pure genius"". Philip's first band ""the Murder Junkies"" still tour today, but they are sure missing an essential element when Philip went solo."
2,disappointing,"i enjoy watching the show nowadays on fx, and find it hilarious and compelling. Needless to say, i don't think the earlier episodes are anywhere near as funny. While al and peggy are still hilarious in this first season, bud and kelly, still young, are pretty uninteresting. this makes this dvd a show composed of essentially two characters, with a few lines from some othersalso, when purchasing this dvd, i ignored the warnings of 'poor picture quality.' well, after watching the episodes, i can say that the picture quality is pretty atrocious. at the worst moments, the picture is fuzzy, and unclear.overall, while there were many funny moments, there weren't enough to merit truly comedic 30 minute episodes. Also, the lack of picture quality drmatically inhibits the dvd's presentation. not worth it."
3,married with childran season 1,I used to watch this as a kid and I still think it is as funny as I did then.
5,About time!,"This release came after the 2 ""wackiest episodes"" releases. I was dissapointed with those previous releases as I felt there were much better episodes, but that is okay. The first season was hit or miss on a few episodes, but has some of the best episodes as well. Yes, the picture quality isn't enhanced but so what? its still the show, and it is better than a vhs dub that you make off of fx or whatever channel has it in syndication. I hope that these releases are successful, because seasons 3,4, and 5 are also chalk full of classics. The best on these disc's has to be the one where Al and Peggy are trying to go to the closing of Al's favorite burger joint. The part where Al is helping Bud fix his remote control car is classic! Pick these releases up because they are just some of the best television moments in history. Wooooo Bundy!!!"
3,WE WANT SUBTITLES COLUMBIA,"Excellent show, classic comedy with millions of fans including many with hearing difficulties so how about subtitles Columbia?Amazon states this is Closed-Captioned, there is even a CC logo on the DVD package itself, but guess what? Once I bought the DVD subtitles/captions etc were nowhere to be found.I'm not sure I'll go through with the rest of the seasons."
3,Bad picture quality,"While the episodes themselves get an automatic 5 stars, the DVD has bad picture quality. I didn't notice it at first until I viewed one of the first season episodes on regular cable--the picture quality was much sharper, clearer and felt like it added a good five years to the episode's age. Other than that, the DVD could have used some more extras, but the picture quality is a real pain in the ass for the money you dish out. Still recommended, because we're not seeing any other 1st or 2nd Married... DVDs."
2,married... but hoping to divorce,The first episodes were truly bad. But the writers got better with time. By episode 5 things got to where I remembered they had to be. Good comedy
5,The funniest show ever,"I just finished watching the Married...With Children Season 1 DVD set. And honestly, it has to be the funniest show ever to air on TV. Or, at least one of the funniest. I would say the top ones are Futurama, Family Guy (the original 4 seasons), and the Simpsons (the original episodes). What do all of these shows have in common? They are all comedy sitcoms. Al Bundy is the classic get-rich quick guy, who will verbally scorn anyone, but loves them dearly. I wish this show was still produced. Actually, no I don't. Because it would probably go the way of the new Family Guy's (nowhere)."
3,Disappointed,"Picture quality of this DVD is very bad ! After seeing the Season one DVD of Cheers I had high hopes for this one, but was very disappointed. Great TV show, but the DVD quality is sub-par !!!"
3,slow start,I'm a big fan of the show however I was disapointed with season one. The characters simply have not jelled together yet. The writing was not quite as witty in the beginning as it was in later seasons. I would recoment skipping the first season.
5,TIME TO CATCH UP,"MASH, BUFFY, SIMPSONS AND NOW FINALLY, MWC SEASON BY SEASON, I'M IN HEAVEN, I'M SO HAPPY, NOTHING CAN RUIN...OH NO PEGGY, NOT TONIGHT...!"
5,spectacular,"this is a must have for ANYBODY who gives a crap about fantastic tv. before my folks got divorced when i was 10, this was the one family get-together we had on a weekly basis. this is not just a show to me, it represents part of my childhood. it is to me what andy griffith was to my parents. i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that is a fan of the show and tv on dvd."
5,The best TV series ever !,"THANKS THANKS THANKS !!!! This is the best TV series ever ! And the first season is the best of the series ! Only CLASSIC episodes are on this DVD ! VIVA LA FRANCE ! That's one of the best quotes on the DVD . I can't wait for season 2, 3, 4 and 5.All the seasons with STEVE, he was sooo good. I want the one with madame Zelda! 4 THUMBS UP !!! Buy this NOW!"
4,about time!!!!,"Well it is about time they released this. This is one funny show, and I am glad I did not waste my money on the ""BEST OF"" editions."
2,A Better Idea!,"I needed a replacement battery for my V170 and found that buying a Tracfone C139 phone on sale for $12.99 was a better idea, and Walmart sells them online for $12.88. The battery that comes standard with this phone is a new Motorola SNN5749A (the same as the V170), manufactured within the last year, and if your V170 quits working you have the C139 to use as a backup phone. It also has a travel charger (plug-in, thinner profile, and prongs that fold-in) versus the bulky one that came with the V170 and it works with both the V170 and C139. Just my opinion after looking everywhere for just the battery and getting frustrated that Motorola wanted $39.99 for an OEM battery."
4,Got What I Ordered With No Problems,Received the battery in a timely manner. It was exactly as advertised and the price was right. What more can you ask for? Would definitely do business with them again! (Should have been 5 stars my mistake.)
5,"Be smart, these are Left and Right specific.","I ordered this one, it is a right.I needed the left.Other then that it was an exact replacement for my trailer and took 5 min to install.3 min to unistall...as a side note, it CAN be installed on the wrong side, but the drain holes end up at the top, and the connections trapped under-water if you use it for a boat, or leave it in the rain..."
4,Did the job.,"The Anderson Marine E440 worked as expected for a budget priced Tail Light. Not sure how long it will last as the materials are a bit flimsy. I didn't spend a lot, so my expectations were low. Installation was relatively easy and it is working."
2,"They work, but...","These things catch of lot of whiteflies, but they also catch other insects, such as juvenile praying mantises. And, although it makes me feel good to see hundreds of dead whiteflies stuck on the trap, there are still lots left eating the vegetables. So you will still have to use chemical controls, like insecticidal soap, to reduce the population of bad insects."
5,Works great,"Used it to take window crank off 2000 dodge dakota. Worked great. Pushes u-clip off far enough to remove handle but, does not make the clip fly off so you lose it. Used the other end to push clip back on before snapping handle back on and it worked great."
1,sounds like uriah heep,"This band sounds like a lot of bands,a few that come to my mind or ,uriah heep early scorpions ,a little emerson ,lake and palmer and deep purple.In japan it is a tribute to the band when you sound alot like that band ,here in the USA they are dislike for it.If you like the classic bands i named buy this cd ,and you wont be dissapointed."
2,Turned off by the preachiness,"I'm a lover of books and bookstores, but for all of the author's enthusiasm, she didn't turn me into an unqualified supporter of the independent bookstore. If anything, I came away with a negative attitude. I found the book overly preachy, and the positions not fully explained. I did enjoy the entertaining stories about various author visits. And the descriptions of the authors that Burton likes were enlightening. I do admire her devotion to the business - the unfathomable amounts of money she must have sunk into it over the years, and the determination she has to keep it going. But much of the book rubbed me the wrong way, culminating with the Harry Potter book release story: Buying up the chains' stock to sell at their own store sounds like an unseemly business practice to me."
1,Not a good Elixir!,"Really now! This DVD is so bad that it sits on my shelf collecting so much dust that I'd be better off putting in the trash! Yes, Maxim Mironov is truly a wonderful singer, but the soprano is really hard to watch. Her singing and gesturing are too strained and overstated. The stage is over crowded and cluttered with much too much nonsense. It's looks like a kid show run ""amok."" I'm only sorry that I waited too long or otherwise it would have been returned. I know these comments probably will not be printed but that's ok. I say the ""truth shall set you free."""
3,Nothing like 11 Transistor,"Lazlo Bane's album 11 Transistor is truly one of my favorites. I was so excited to get this album and was then so disappointed. I gave it a 3 star rating because it is of course better than all popular cr*p music today, but it is just not a good album."
4,What I was looking for.,"Recently I've noticed my music library is a little heavy with not enough Fun to balance out the angst. This album adds just the levity I was looking for and there's nothing actually wrong with any of the songs. A good song for me is one that can hold my attention, that provides a nice soundtrack to life. This album does that."
1,One hit on the entire CD,"Like most of the CD's that record companies release, there's only really one good song on there: Superman - the well known theme song used in 'Scrubs'. Other than that, the rest of the songs pretty much suck. It's like when iTunes came out and the record industry resisted the idea of selling tracks individually, since people would just buy one good track and skip the fillers. That was way back in 2001, which is around when this album came out, so maybe artists and record labels have changed their ways since then, and are filling the whole disc with good songs?"
1,Simpler to get from the source,I read the reviews here and went to the website for the Nutrition Action Healthletter which is only $10 a year on it's website! I'll be ordering it from the source ~ after reading all the reviews based more on delivery than content. This is a great publication.
1,Haven't received anything but they cashed the check November 1st,I'd like to tell you all something but I sent my check to them on October 28th they cashed it November 1st and I have yet to see a magazine.........No Nutritional news but I'm sure I'll need something soon to bring that Blood Pressure down.... LOLWell thanks for a forum to complain.
2,poor communication,"When I tried to renew my subscription I was asked to click on a country, but the United States wasn't on the list and I couldn't type it in. They wouldn't accept my renewal without it, so I guess I can't renew with PayPal. After reading the other reviews, I hesitate to send a check--too bad; it is an informative little newsletter"
1,Subscription Slow,"I also experienced slow subscription service. Ordered 28 March and nothing from them on 16 July yet. I did however find a contact web page for them at http://www.cspinet.org/nah/custserv.htm and I did use that page to write an email. Now, let's see how well they respond."
1,No Nutrition Action Healthletter for me.,"This sounds like a excellent magazine, but after reading the negative reviews about subscription and communication problems I decided not to order a subscription."
5,Outstanding Newsletter!,"I agree with the positive comments here 100%. Great newsletter. Unbiased and very informative. It's the ""Consumers Report"" in the area of nutrition."
2,"Awkward, lacking in brilliance","Perhaps if I hadn't been raised on Arthur Rubenstein's recording of these sonatas I would find Serkin's renditions as flawless as this album's reputation. When I listen to this recording, I hear Serkin laboriously attempting technically perfect fingering and mathematical precision of tempo. To me, the trilling within the third movement of Moonlight is hopelessly awkward -- similar to that of a 2nd year pianist -- and the performance lacking in emotional highs and lows. I greatly prefer Rubenstein's interpretations, finding them to be much more fluid, graceful and intensely emotional."
4,R. Serkin less a place to start than one of many to end up,"Rudolph Serkin's Beethoven sonatas are different and interesting, but there are many, many versions of the popular Beethoven sonatas that are different and interesting. Better (more mainstream?) performers to start with might include Wilhelm Kempff, Emil Gilels, or possibly Schnabel. Richard Goode and Stephen Kovacevich have performed well in more modern recordings (though Kovacevich's cycle has a clinker or two as well.) Solomon's versions of the late Sonatas should not be missed if you acquire ""the bug"", and one could (and should) also dip into individual sonatas by Arrau, Brendel and others. (Certain of Svatislav Richter's performances available on Praga and Revalation should also not be missed.) In short, Rudolph Serkin's vision of these works may make his Beethoven less a place to start than one of many places to end up."
4,"Funny stuff, not much action, though","If you like Anime but never watched any ""City Hunter"" Videos, this would be a good one to start with. It passes itself off as an action flick at first, but its way more comical, with wacky slapstick humor between Joe and his female sidekick. Joe is quite possibly the funniest heroes I've ever seen, and some of the things he does in the film are so brash, they're hilarious!Essesntially the story is about Joe and his friends trying to stop a madman called The Professor from blowing up Tokyo, but the more memorable parts of the film involve Joe and women...they're too funny to mention without actually spoinilg the best parts of the movie. The action sequences aren't that great, although the climax is kinda cool...If you're a woman though, since a lot of the humor involve Joe's womanizing perverted ways, you may not think it's funny at all."
4,Contemporary Christmas with a classic twist...,"Very nice contemporary Christmas music, and interestingly enough many have a tastefully old time vibe going on... Very nice, Faith. No regrets purchasing this project."
4,Great Christmas Album!!!!,"I love this album, especially the last four tracks. For a minute, I had to actually remember that these were Christmas songs. Faith's voice will easily put you into that soul mood. I don't need anything else for Christmas, Faith did it with this album. Not sure if anybody out right now (with the exception of Kelly Price and Yolanda Adams) can match or outdo her voice. She's fabulous. I've never bought a Christmas album, but I am a hopeless Faith Evans fan. Once again, she's made me smile. Please add to your collection."
1,Awful....,"I bought this holiday cd and was terribly disappointed. The cd was just horrific. Why did she let her husband produce the whole cd is what I wanna know? I gave her a star for effort, but that's it. Now the cd before this one was 5 star and one of her best efforts yet."
1,NOT A MERRY CHRISTMAS!,I just bought this cd tonight and Im sorry ITS TRASH!! I was hoping to hear some of the songs like This Christmas....done in a more traditional manner with some soul...instead I got some EXTRA ish! She has songs on here that dont even sound like Christmas music...she has chopped up the original of This christmas to make it sound like some slooow molasses song...she DRAGS out notes/songs FOREVER! Its ridiculous...I tell you Faith....wont get my money again for a long long time!
4,Great Product,"This is a really nice protector. It has a lip on in so your tools don't slide off while you are working on your car. A mangnetic quality so it does not slide around on the fender. The only thing I didn't care so much for is the color. It is not gray, it is bright orange.Lisle 24750 Heavy Duty Fender Protector"
3,Works but No Magnets,"I bought this to work on my new (to me) car in the garage. No being an accomplished grease monkey, I figured this would help prevent me from scratching my paint. While the protecter does in fact protect the fender, it does not have the magnets mentioned in the item description. I was very careful to look for one that says it had magnets as I did not want the protector to fall every time I walked away.Now, I have a protector that only covers a small portion of the fender since I have to move it up so high over the engine compartment. Not happy."
2,needs to be wider that 30 inches,"The cover needs to be more than 30 inches wide so as to protect the entire fender, 36 inches would be ideal."
5,Lisle Fender Covers,Great budget priced alternative to the mega expensive fender covers found on the traveling tool trucks or the cheapies found folded up in plastic packages found in chain auto department stores. Just what the mechanic MD ordered!Tom S. in Tn.Lisle 24750 Heavy Duty Fender Protector
2,Not magnetic,"I dont know what a magnetic property is, but apparently it doesn't include sticking to metal. This cover is not magnetic, but whatever it is made of is fairly high quality and thick material."
2,"good, pity about markings","the book is OK, it is just a pity about the markings in the book but it will be very handy as I am a theological stuent and I need this book for one of my subjects. Thanks and God Bless you all"
5,2 weeks so far,"and it works well. the guy in the other reviews for this who suggested the inline dimmer switch to regulate the temp control, my hat goes off to you sir. the rock gets hot at it's default full-power setting, and I heard amphibians can boil themselves if they're exposed to continuously higher temperature over time (as opposed to suddenly)it's in a 10-gallon tank, and it takes up 1/3 - 1/2 of the tank floor which makes it kind of big, but that's ok because it's a great product and the less stuff in the tank the easier it is to clean anyway, and the lizard loves staying inside it.to get the cord out of the tank i just clipped out a little square in the tank top fence thing, fed the cord through then taped it over.and if you're using a terrarium liner instead of sand substrate i'd suggest always using it as the cave and not as the rock (because only the rock/top part of the cave is heated, just a safety precaution)"
3,Good item. Possible future problem.,"Not too much to say. Unit looks good (I got the burgundy-gray color) and provides a cove for my lizards. They also love being on top. One point of concern: after several months of use and cleaning, small areas of the insulated heat wires are starting to show through the surface. The spots are about 1/8"" spots, but are becoming pronounced. If it gets much worse, I will discontinue use of the product. Also, there is no heat adjustment (or even a switch) on the unit."
2,Broken as well.,"Mine also came re, but I don't mind the red.I do mind that it came in about 10 pieces, instead of two. This is made of cement. It needs to be packaged better. I ended up just (unsafely) gluing enough together to cover the heating element. It'll work for now, but I wouldn't recommend buying online. It'll just end up getting broken."
1,wrong color and arrived broken,i ordered this thinking i was ordering a gray cave. a red cave arrived and it was broken at the base and is unusable.
1,Crappy product with crappy description,"Product just arrived in a bunch of pieces. In red. They say it comes in two colors in the descrtiption, but there are no color options. You'd think grey would be default given the picture, but thats not the case either. It basically comes in red only.Not that any of that matters right now since It is basically made of chalk and will break before it even gets to your house.Im so pissed I paid money for this."
3,Good undergraduate textbook,"Having used this book for graduate instruction for a term, I found the content to often be lighter than I would like for a graduate class. Byers uses it himself for an undergraduate course and in that context, it is probably excellent, five stars. This is especially true given the weak competition represented by the books that it replaces, most notably 'New Venture Creation'.It has several case studies if you think that method is useful (I remain skeptical) and several video presentations that are at least entertaining and can serve as excellent period pieces.It appears that the nature of the subject matter continues to require a larger burden on the instructor to collect relevant, timely material appropriate to the audience."
3,Getting Ready dolls disappointing,"I started collecting the My Scene dolls about a year ago and I was disappointed when they introduced the smiling dolls. The ""Jammin in Jamaica"" dolls were so beautiful and the ""Getting Ready"" series is a real let down. Their grins are so scary looking particually the Madison and Kenzie dolls. The ""Getting Ready Madison"" is the most unflattering doll in the collection and I would skip her altogether. Kenzie on the other hand is actually a cute doll if you take her hair down and change her outfit. You get use to the freckles. Hopefully the next collection will be non-smiling."
3,Not what i expected.......,"I saw the piccy of this doll on the website, and she looked really pretty, especially in the cartoon, but when i got her she looked a right weirdo! She has these great big ugly spots all over her face, i think they're meant to be freckles but instead they look like some serious acne problem. And, she's got this horrid great big cheesy grin plastered right over her face which makes her look like she's got bad toothache or summat. I think the MyScenes r well cool and they used to be really sophisticated and pretty but now they look like idiots with those goofy smiles. Plus, Kenzie just comes with no real clothes, a bathtub and plastic bubbles, and, of course, a great big goofy false grin. i guess the accessories and the fuzzy bathrobe r kinda cool, and I love her hair, but mattel have totally spoilt these dolls, get the grin-free ones while u can!"
3,Be very careful,"There are (apparently) three separate books under this title. There is a text book (hardback), a teacher's manual, and a student workbook. I (foolishly) ordered the $25 version thinking it was the paperback version of the textbook - wrong. It was the teacher's manual."
2,List of Manufacturers,"From page 4 on to the last page, all this book has is a list of products, their manufacturers and a one paragraph description of the product. This might be valuable to some people, but for those of us looking for a guide on building green, this book is disappointing."
5,I love it! I love it! I love it!,"The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir has done it again! This CD is so powerful I may need to order another one because I have played it so much and I want a backup in case it gets scratched. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone who loves Spirit filled, uplifting, exhiliarating, relaxing and heartfelt singing. This choir is not just singing words, they are singing their experiences with the Almighty God."
5,Be Glad,CD was sent in perfect condition!! great sound doesn't skip @ all! I admire that this CD can also be purchased with the actual music to teach choir~great for all music educators
1,Trooping the Colour - Coldstream Guards,"Disappointing. It seems to me that the music recorded on the CD is selective and some of the ceremony is chopped. Also I feel that the tempo is a 1/4 beat faster than actually played. I think if the Foot Guards marched past at that rate they would overtake and pass the cavalry in about a 1/2 mile. Good if you like military bands. Doubtful if you have done the duty and want to reminisce. If anyone has a suggestion for a better CD, I would love to know about it."
2,Shoddy transfer - strongly advise against,"The downloads are all compressed at 24fps. All CGI sequences in Babylon 5 were originally done at 30 fps and thus *all* of them are jerky and highly unnatural. It is incomprehensible how such decision was made and the series botched. I am a big Bab 5 fan but the quality is both so bad (compression-wise) and transferred inappropriately (should have been NTSC) that I can give this only two stars, if not less.Shame on the distributor, this is short of a scam. Not even the series credits have been properly done. Get the DVDs, this is a rip-off."
2,Past its prime,"I remember B5 when it first came out. It was a great series in a desert of unimaginative TV sci-fi programming. I loved it and it was a feature in the short-lived fanzine, Split/Image, which I published back in the 90s. BUT the times have changed. While trying to rewatch old taped programs I have realized that the old charisma is simply no longer there.Subject matter seems lame and irrelevant and even boring though i enjoy the antics of some of the characters.This is a different age for a different audience. B5 is best left the relic it has become. If you purchase these videos be sure to understandtheir place in the evolution of the genre as they do stand as a testament to a time when G'Kar and Mollari were the only game in town!"
3,Functioned properly but over priced,"I bought these to go in an ODL tubular skylight and was willing to spend a little extra thinking it would be worth the money to just pop 'em in. Well, despite what the directions said, they have to be disassembled to fit up into the skylight. The threaded conduit tubing has to be inserted into the hole you drill in the skylight from the attic side. This conduit will not fit up into the skylight and through the drilled hole if you place the light at the height described in the instructions, it is too long. The wiring and fixture do have to be feed from the opening of the skylight in the room. Unless you have a helper, this is a pain to do solo. The fixture and parts can be found at an electrical store significantly cheaper, and I don't see any advantage to buying this kit, unless you don't want to shop around.Once installed these have functioned fine."
3,Love the light source. Packaging and build quality poor.,"Got this and a good price here, so can't complain. The knuckles come apart very easily, making install more difficult than necessary. Otherwise, tube skylights are great and easy to install versus traditional ones. The natural light we now get in our kitchen and bathroom is fantastic at a fraction of the hassle of a rectangular skylight."
4,Nice addition to skylight,Light kit was a nice way to eliminate the need for an additional hall light. The gee-whiz factor is high from everyone who sees it. Installation was simple although the price is a bit steep considering the cost of the individual components that make up the unit - hence the 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars.
1,so sorry u only got a star,again and again i trusted her and again and again she let me down..this is worst than anything else...the worst album i've got on my cd rack..i am so sorry for her....half a star for her song-writters and half for the cover..
5,Review of Duryee Zouave,"A Duryee Zouave by Thomas Southwick is an easy read and a first hand account of a 5th NY Civil War soldier who at 5'1"" joins the special unit Duryee formed in 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil War in NYC. As a 5th Zouave re-enactor I have especially enjoyed reading about the events of the 5th through the eyes of Southwick who served with Duryee's Zouaves."
5,Schubert Illuminated,"Rangell's sensitivity allows Schubert to sparkle. He interprets the music illuminating at every turn. Every note has a purpose. He unifies these works beautifully and poetically. Rangell's technique does not disappoint, as he utilizes his expansive color palate. I highly recommend these recordings."
4,It Happens Just Once,"Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and guest star Sarah Vaughan only happend once and they shot the moon. It's all about the music of Gershwin and when you hear Sarah's voice bending notes up and down, becoming the human horn she was, you will gasp. Adding a jazz approach to Gershwin's music was nothing new, but having it played by the Philharmonic pushes this one to five stars. This is Sarah in her later years and the voice was never better. This would have made a fine DVD to see the full orchestra, the crowd reactions and Sarah having fun. This gem gets more than a couple martini's."
5,"Clear, concise answers",I rely heavily on this book in my job and I really appreciate the clear language because I am not a CPA or lawyer.

5,Awesome Jam,I had this jam years ago in Paris and it is still the best strawberry jam I have ever eaten.
3,SO/SO,"If you have been to France and had their Wild Strawberry jam and know how amazing it is-this product might disappoint. It is still a decent product, but I have found better in Dean and DeLuca (granted that jam was $17). For the price of this product, I probably wouldn't purchase it again, maybe if the price was lowered."
5,Physical Acoustics-Dr. Blackstock,"Dr. Blackstock is one of the most lucid technical writers I have encoutered in my (long) career as a phd candidate at UT-Austin Acoustics. If you are trying to understand physical acoustics there is no better book. Kinsler and Frey is weak in comparison. From this book, one can easily step up to Morse's classic Vibration and Sound, or even Theoretical Acoustics with out a flinch. This book is definetely a must have on your personal library."
3,Excellent performance let down by flawed audio,"This wonderful performance of Emperor is captivating and lively from the very first opening notes. You can't listen to this CD just once! It's just that good. But in the louder passages there is an audio transcription problem (mostly noticeable in the right channel) which adds some minor crackling noises and loses crispness on a few crucial areas.The more I listen to this CD, unfortunately, the more I notice the flaws. It tends to spoil it for me.I'm going to buy another CD of this piece. If there's one with as good a performance, minus the audio problem, that's what I hope to find."
2,"Wonderful Performance, Poor Recording","All other reviewers seem to be satisfied with the quality of this recording, I found mine to be very poor. The performance is beautiful-you would be hard pressed to find better; however my download was riddled with not only digital but also very distracting background noise. At times it seems as if the recording was made from someone in the audience. The moving climactic crescendos are marred by slight distortion and at times you can hear what sounds like humming. I've owned a copy of this recording in the past and don't remember all these imperfections. You might be better served buying a hard copy of this recording."
5,Grandioso...,"Beethoven escribio este grandioso concierto, una joya musical.Leonard Bernstein dirije en forma sobresaliente a una impecable Filarmonica de Nueva York y Rudolf Serkin nos deslumbra en forma extraordinaria. Es una presentacion colosal.El concierto que tiene un inicio sublime se empieza a energizar y se convierte en una sesion de vigor intenso; luego un adagio sutil, sentimental, profundo va poco a poco destinado a explotar en un allegro generoso, potente y vibrante.Es de verdad una interpretacion soberbia en uno de las mejores grabaciones de este concierto.Busquen la edicion real (Sony Classical - CD azul) en que se incluyen el concierto N3 y el N5."
2,Sound quality not up to par,"I too found the sound quality distracting, which is a shame. There are pops and general noises in some of the quiet parts. Then, there are also weird sounds that I assume are coming from the bass fiddles when they really bow with force. It could be that on vinyl these things weren't as apparent, but in the digital age it just didn't cut it for me."
5,Great Condoms,"I was skeptical of these condoms mainly because of the price. More than worth it! Felt like nothing was there was exactly right! Great condom, a little unusual. But all in all best condom ever used!"
5,Great Reference,This book has really helped me to implement a good strategy at my company for improving our cost of poor quality as well as information on providing relavent information to key people!
4,Quality Cost for Quality Efficient,This book is a great resume for a Quality cost improvement and an excellent guide for that.
1,very bad for the money,the book a very thin 47 page paper back which has very little to do with Panama. The characters never make it to Panama. This book is worth less than $1.00
3,classic early talkie gangster flick not remastered,"THis movies print looks really bad , like many warner brothers movies on standard dvd they made no attempt to clean up or repair the print. Still this is a classic early gangster movie in which edward g robinson shines as the title monster mobster. Sure this movie is a little stagey and this was because they had to work around the microphone in the early days.This movie is still worth watching even with a bad print because it's a good gangster movie and it was made at a time when the country was under siege by violent criminals. Just like we are today. I hope that warner bros does a blu ray boxset with some of these great 1930's gangster movies and remasters them and uses computers to fix the prints. This one deserves to be on such a blu ray set because it's where it all started."
3,Early Gangster Film,"Little Caesar was one of Warner Brothers' first gangster movies, and it helped to establish the genre and make it a prominent part of the Warner Brothers' output. Edward G. Robinson was an unlikely star, and this was the film that put him on the map. His performance as Rico is never boring, although it has little subtlety (which usually works for the character). The story is well structured, chronicling his rise and fall. But the lack of a musical score (typical for an early sound film when they were still learning about the medium) is noticeable, and the pacing is off. The main character of Rico is pretty unlikeable, which affects viewer involvement in the movie. As an early sound film, it has historical interest, but as entertainment, it is not as successful."
2,Little Story,"This is a fairly decent performance by Edward G. Robinson and the rest the cast but the story is not that compelling and the sets, music, and direction don't stand out. I recommend ""Key Largo"" over this one. Both Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart put in great performances. Not only that you have a better story, music, and direction. Besides you can get ""Key Largo"" on DVD for less than this movie.Even fans of this movie should consider the fact it is expensive for VHS. I wouldn't buy ""Little Caesar"" on VHS anyway, I would wait for it on DVD if you like it."
4,ICONIC WARNER GANGSTER CLASSIC,"Hollywood got the message when 37 year old Edward G. Robinson bellowed into the phone, ""This is Rico speaking. Rico! R-I-C-O! Rico! Little Caesar, that's who!"" in the iconic LITTLE CAESAR (1930). The dark moral tale recounts the rise and fall of pugnacious Caesar Enrico Bandello (Robinson), a hoodlum with a Chicago-sized chip on his shoulder, few attachments, fewer friends and no sense of mobster etiquette.Extras: a 1930 newsreel, the Spencer Tracy short ""The Hard Guy,"" ""Lady Play Your Mandolin"" cartoon and the new featurette ""Little Caesar: End of Rico, Beginning of the Antihero."" The interesting commentary's by cinema historian Richard Jewell."
5,One Of The Best Ever,"Awsome fights, great animation, great story, very funnyThe intro is very cool, and the outro is funny as crapVery funny show there was this one part were they made fun of the power rangers i thought i was gonna cry.Its pretty gory too when she ripped his heart out blood everywereDont just buy a volume get the perfect collection, the only thing wrong with this show is its over too soonI couldnt quit watching i got through all 12 eps in one sittinganywayIf you like funny anime get this oneIf you like action anime get this oneIf you like anime with good animation good storys and good music get this one"

5,Great American Quote Book Boxed Set,Great American Quote Book Boxed Set: Gave to my sister for Christmas. She loved it. My niece saw it & is buying one for boyfriend.
5,MAKES HISTORY COME ALIVE!,"I bought my husband, a history buff, this book for Christmas, but I haven't even let him read it! It offers a fresh window into famous people and great events of the past. I love it!"
5,Ruddy is still great,"I have the tools to be the perfect critic. I have little sense of rhythm or pitch, and do not read music. Be that as it may, I have listened and listened and listened and appreciate differences in interpretations and performances. Serkin is my gold-standard, because he is what I cut my teeth on. His style is of the grand, but later more enlightened, Romantic era. The performances are fluid and 'effortless' (in my humble, but honest, opinion) and give the impression that all the nuances of the works were settled long ago by the performers who love playing them with a telepathic power. BTW, for those growing there musical holdings on a budget, this is an excellent choice and the sound quality is decent at least to these sad old ears."
5,Advanced Strategis for Trophy Whitetails,This book is an insight into the mind of the Trophy Whitetail. David Morris shares his lifetime passion with the avearage deer hunter as well as the true Trophy hunter. His teachings will certainly help me with my future pursuits of this elusive animal.
5,Great entertainment coupled with cutting edge info.,"As with his first book, Hunting Trophy Whitetails, Morris has set a new standard in whitetail literature in Advanced Strategies. This book will make anyone a better hunter and help the true sportsman understand and appreciate the remarkable whitetail in new ways. It's a must read for serious outdoors men and women."
1,"Deceptive sales practice, and it don't work","I bought this item, and first off this supplier (it's not Amazon) shows you a picture of a brand new HP product. Read the entire print of your purchase, it's refurbished, not new. Marketing of this type is deceptive since many people associate their purchase with a visual of the item - in my book deception is a lie. I will not buy from this supplier again. Second problem occurred after I put in the black ink cartridge. Similar to other reviewer(s) here, it flat out did not work. I wasted a lot of my color cartridge trying to clean the cartridges, re-clean, prime, test, clean again...it's broke. Just simply don't buy this garbage, do yourself a favor and buy a brand new HP product packaged from the company itself. It will be 100% reliable."
1,bad ink cartridges,I ordered the combo ink cartridge package. The black cartridge quit working after one page. I emailed the contact person and it took almost a week before he got back to me. They sent a replacement cartridge and it worked the same as the first. I will not buy from them again.
2,Poor quality control,"I received a black and a color ink cartridge for a HP DeskJet 950C. The black cartridge worked fine. The first color cartridge flat out did not work. The printer said it was defective and refused to even try to print with the color cartridge. I sent the color cartridge back and received a second color ink cartridge. This one worked, but about half of the cyan orifices did not work when the test page was printed. So I sent this (second) color ink cartridge back also. I am waiting to receive my third cartridge.The service and turnaround is great. Emails fly forth on shipping dates and apologies for the defective cartridges."
3,"quality is fine, but it's just too expensive.","quality is fine, but it's just too expensive. i do not believe the inks themselves worth what i paid, just i do not have other place to find them at that time."
1,Author should hide in shame,"This has got to be one of the worst technical books I've ever encountered. Full of mistakes, incomplete information, injection of unexplained terms and concepts whilst (badly) explaining one topic...and I've only had the patience to go thru chapter 5. Whole pages are devoted to repeating the exact same thing - copy/paste job from hell.I doubt anybody on the planet would be able to pass the exams using this book. The author, editors, and the technical reviewers (especially the ones at Sun) should be ashamed to have sacrificed perfectly useful blank paper to produce this abomination. I hope the author did a better job writing his Ph.D. thesis than this book.Got this book as a ""buy this one, get another cheaper one free"" deal. The cheaper, free one Windows 2000 Server Professional Reference by Kiranjit Siyan is 1000x better. Feh."
2,Don't waste your money on this one...,"This book does cover most of the Sun objectives for the exam... But the book is poorly written, with a lot of mistakes. (Many of the mistakes are already listed in the other reviews here.) I also agree with reviewer ""Sally"" in that the content was copy and pasted all throughout the book... Paul Watters has a good start here, but needs to pay more attention to detail... and needs to add more examples and content. I don't believe that many will pass with just this book. Oh yeah... Paul... you can stop with all those Windows jokes... I've heard them all."
1,A poor study guide- zero stars,"Nothing on RBAC (Roled Based Access), nothing on SMC (Solaris Management Console)- just to name a few VERY important certification topics that are missing from this Cert. Study Guide. I can't use this to study for the exam- it does not cover the objectives. Why would I study CDE and Printing- it's not on the exam! The author should first take the exams himself or at least get his objectives straight. These objectives are for the Solaris 7 exam- not Solaris 8. Another example of a publisher trying to get something to market that's sub-standard.It's much like the Watters Solaris 8 Complete Ref. - it's the same material, just a different cover. That guide was also missing very important Solaris 8 topics."
4,Going for exam,"Use this book and some of online test sites and feel good to sit exam. The CD-ROM was useful but I wish more questions (only 400 on the CD). 1,000 would be better. Now worry that Solaris 9 certificate will be soon and must sit exam again."
4,Nothing's Gonna Stop the Metal Dinosaurs,"As all Accept releases, this one is one of the pinnacles of Power Metal. It is notably heavier and more rhythmic than the other Accept albums, a la Pantera. The only drawback to the album is the number of tracks (15) and the presence of a similar vibe through most of the tracks. However, that said, it is less melody-oriented and more riff-oriented, and at times can be *gasp* boring.The high points of the album are in the aggressive songs, with thunderous drumming and a heavy sound. Guitarist Wolf Hoffman displays some tricks he's learned in the decade since ""Balls to the Wall,"" notably harmonic / tremolo tricks and dive bombs."
4,"Interesting, controversial and well writen","You might not like Agassi, but you will love this book. It's really a pity Andre didn't accept to talk with the author. Nevertheless, you get an even view on Agassi's turbulent career."
2,"Fascinating subject, terrible writing","Andre Agassi is without a doubt one of the most fascinating, complex tennis players in recent history---but the author, Paul Bauman, was not the one to write about him. Basically, he just took every clipping ever published on Agassi and threw it together in a book with no rhyme or reason. It was poorly organized and poorly thought-out. I would love to find an excellent biography on Andre Agassi but this book is definitely not it."
2,I have seen this technique before....,"I have seen this technique before in others unauthorized bios... The writer simply goes out searaching for magazines and TV interviews featuring the star on focus, thatn releases a book without having PERSONALLY interviewd anybody related to the star!! Simply sepaking, it's almos a job of Control C, Control V !! (COPY AND PASTE!!)"
2,Wait for the real thing,"This is not a great book about Agassi. It is more about his dad than Andre and the book is written, not from information gleamed from personal interviews, but mostly from other already published sources. The book does little to fill in gaps in his personal life. I don't think the author had too many primary sources for this book. Save your time and your money for the book that Andre very recently got a $5M check for - that should worth your time to read. This is not."
5,Easily the best,"Drill bit and countersink are really sharp unlike most similar tools. Also, the drill bit is tapered like a wood screw so you actually get holding power from the tip of the screw if you adjust the depth correctly."
5,30 celcius under load and stress,"Slapped this puppy on my Phenom II with some aluminum Evercool fans and some Arctic Silver Ceramique and my CPU has NEVER gone over 30 Celcius. I run a Linux distro on my system, but I game on it which means I have to use emulators and compatibility layers to run stuff which is more stressful on the CPU than running the games natively under Windows. The ONLY con with it is that you can only place it one position when using an AMD processor. This thing is also HUGE, so make sure you have room for it as this thing is about as big as my head."
5,Love it,"Once I figured out how to install it (bit of a novice at the time) and got the fans that it needs to run, this dropped my cpu temps by 10 degrees C."
3,Good price for an overpriced item,"I hate to buy inkjet printer cartridges, but they're a necessary evil...these were significantly less than retail stores charge and in original manufacturers packaging, so not recycled or refilled, which some ""low cost alternative"" sellers do."
3,I'm stuck with it,"What can I say--these are what my printer takes. They work fine, and seem to last a long time. They do what they're supposed to do on my cheap HP printer. Nothing dazzling, nothing horrid."
4,Yo Kidz 2: the Armor of God,Can't wait for my grandsons to hear this. Thanks for such a quick response when ordered.
1,IT STINKS!,"Parents, please do not buy this album. On a musical level, this album is unlistenable. Carman is in no way talented. Also, Carman's clever metaphors mask unspeakable atrocities, things like violence, racism, and warmongering."
3,"Average book, somewhat trite ...","Books are probably a lot about expectations. Reading about this one I thought it was worth a shot. Improv is well, interesting. Yet as I got into it I find it lacking in of all things originality and the advice it offers throughout is found in about any self help book, not just the good ones. While at times it had interesting parts it was a struggle to finish and I found it lacking in real life substance."

4,"Superb Stern, Brilliant Bernstein","The duo Bernstein/Stern produced here one of the most intense recordings of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. There is an undescriptible feeling of warmth and joy in this recording. The performance is excellent and much better than the Karajan/Ferras or the Nigel Kennedy recordings (despite the slight bakground noise, perhaps due to the analogic source). I only gave it four stars because of this slight noise (mostly audible when listening to the recording with headphones)"
1,Yuck--no $avings here.,"In our quest to save energy and cost, we bought a 5 pk of the Feit 40w eqiv. for our 5 bulb vanity light strip. When one of the orig regular bulbs burned out, we replaced it. And again. We tested the socket by swapping bulbs, placing the Feit in another socket. Yup. And again. And again. And again. We've now used all 5 and the other original four are still going strong---not one of them has burned out. Saving energy? Don't know. I would think that it took more energy and resources to make the flourescents that are now trash. Cost? Whoa. That was an expensive experiment. We're stocking up on regular bulbs now. Stay ""green"". Don't buy these. Sorry."
2,This is not the Godfather of soul,"Despite the fact that this gospel CD is consistantly listed with James Brown's catalog in on-line stores, it is NOT by the James Brown we all know from such hits as ""Sex Machine"" and ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"". Rather, it is a collection by a little-known gospel artist who is also named James Brown. This JB usually uses his middle initial to differentiate himself from the Godfather of Soul. But for some reason he neglected to do so on this release, causing much confusion and many returned CDs. So the bottom line is this: don't buy this if you're looking for the King of Soul, Mr. Please Please himself, the Minister of New new Super Heavy FUnk, Jaaaaames Brown--because this ain't him."
5,Barton Scores a Birdie!,"What a delightful collection of golf stories! Each chapter transports the reader to a unique period in time and on occasion, a different planet. These gentle stories are very sweet. Upon completion, the reader will feel as though they just finished eating chocolate chip cookies straight from the cooling rack."
1,"Rubbish at best, an insult to music at worst","Utter dross, a butchering of some half decent tunes into a worthless mess. Alex Smith and the boys of Moving Pictures might be happy with the royalty cheques, but I can't help but thinking this insipid version of ""What About Me?"" should make them re-release the original and put this mediocre imitation to sleep permanently.I only heard this album once, but it was once too often. Leave this for the bargain bin at the local CD store and for garage sales where it will surely end up.How come Steve from Melbourne is now Chicky from Dalby? How come Chicky from Dalby is now Annette from Kingaroy?"
4,Shannon Noll is an Aussie Superstar!,"Shannon has just today released the second single Drive from this album. The first single What About Me went straight to number 1 and is still on the Australian charts. Drive is expected to max out on the charts just as well.There are any number of tracks on this album that Shannon could release as singles and have them go to Number 1.His voice is delicious, well suited to the rock, pop and romantic ballads he has on this album.I strongly recommend this album."
5,Actually quite good!,"I'm a real music cynic, so I was not expecting to think much of an album launched by a reality TV show. This album managed to surprise me by having a complete lack of 'manufactured feel' about it. It features catchy country rock songs that are easy to sing along to. Shannon's heartfelt preformance of them really prevents them from sounding unconvincingly slick. It's almost a shame Drive was the second single from the album, as standout tracks were 'burn', new beginnings, and 'wise'. The final track on the album was writen by Shannon and his brother, and is probably the weakest track. Having said that, it's still quite likeable and catchy. I'm looking forward to the next album, and to seeing how his songwriting skills evolve.Well done Shannon. Best of luck with your career - may you be the John Farnham of your generation!"
4,New to Australian Idol,"I am a fan of American Idol, of course. It just so happened when I was doing an on-line search that I came across Guy Sebastian and Shannon Noll. I was curious so I ordered this CD and Beautiful Life by Guy. I really really like this CD a lot. More than Guy's CD actually. Shannon has that little scratch to his voice that I love! He looks hot and sounds great. Learn to Fly is just a fab song. I can't stop listening to it. His rendition of What about Me is super as well! The whole Idol series is about finding undiscovered talent. Too many of the American contestants are R&B singers. About time there was an Idol - somewhere - that does some pop. As a previous review stated - Shannon does pop/country-esque songs. Great Great Great! I will definitely buy his next CD! Shannon has a new fan in the States!"
4,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"Basically this album is still acceptable. He got a really different voice compare to other singers. And i think this voice would suits Country Rock music style more. An ok album to be own. Frankly speaking, I think the other Australian Idol Season 1's finalist whose named Rob Mills(a.k.a known as Millsy or Millswah) has a better album ""Up All Night"" produced compare to this one. Also keep an eye out for Paulini Curuenavuli's album ""One Determind Heart"" and Cosima De Vito's forthcoming album(currently the album is on working in US with music producer Diane Warren), they will be an even better albums for sure. Check them out guys ;>"
1,One star is too much,"Having read many good reviews on this album, I decided to buy it. Upon listening to it the first time I couldn't believe how bad Shannon is. Being under the impression that he was a runner-up, I thought he must be good. How wrong I was! This album is a joke and I can't help wondering how bad the rest of the idols could be! There's just nothing to enjoy in Shannon's voice.For those who wish to buy Shannon's album, try to listen a few songs first before you buy and see if you really like it."
4,Love this one!,"I love this album. There is not a single track that you want to hurry through.Shannon has a big 'rock' voice but he sings soft romantic ballads so sexily that he burns.In fact, one of my favourite tracks on this album is called Burn -- and it does.Wow!"
1,Hype over substance,"A real victory for hype over substance. It shows how far Australia has gone in following the American path to the mediocre.If you want to listen to ""What About Me?"", then go no further than the original by Moving Pictures on their album ""Days of Innocence"". Don't bother with the insipid far less inspiring version on this album. Fortunately, I only heard this dross once and it was once too often.Leave alone or listen at your peril. Just truly awful. How about something original, Shannon?I'm just wondering if Steve from Melbourne who wrote a glowing review actually works for BMG? That one is a tad suss to me."
1,Unbelievable,"I'm not gonna waste my time writing comment on this Shannon Noll guy. He's simply terrible. He can only sing one song well (""What About Me""), and the rest are simply terrible. He's good at butchering good songs and make you hate them. I don't understand why someone would buy his album and waste their hard-earned money. I guess some people just have bad taste."
4,sound of silence,"A great bonus on this disc is the use of a cinema organ to play the specially written scoreThe film itself is good entertainment, so you see and hear it how it would have been presented in the splendour of a movie palace of the mid 1920's"
4,"Overpraised, but full of good things.","There has been a conspiracy in film histories, even in those that profess sympathy to non-American cinemas, to reduce Indian cinema to the populism of Bollywood and the humanism of Satyajit Ray. It is when you see audacious films like Ghitak's 'The Cloud-Capped Star' that Ray's conservatism becomes apparent, his stylistic restraint, his formal totalising, his apoliticism.This is not to say that 'Pather' isn't full of good things - the move from social realism to the mystical; the montages of nature; the Gothic structure leading to the most harrowing storm in cinema; the space for comedy and play amidst all the poverty; the startling introduction of Apu. By all means start with Ray; just remember he's not the whole story."
4,An Important Film,"I had read an inmense amount of articles regarding this film by Satyajit Ray as one of the greatest works of art in film history. I can safely say this is no exaggeration. It is an unbelievably moving demonstration of what cinema can achieve. The story deals with the problems faced by a family because of the poverty they can't escape. My favorite performances were those given by the actresses who portrayed Dungar and Auntie. It is a definite hearbreaker, with a beautiful, poetic ending. I can only say I'll be looking up the two sequels this one inspired- -""Aparajito"" and ""The World of Apu""--very soon"
5,Masterwork,Satyajit Ray produced this simple film set in a small village in Bengal. The story is of a Brahmin who struggles to support his family. He has to travel in a search to find something. Against his travels the story of the family is explained. The black and white photography is the work of genius.When the film was made it was as if India was introduced into the world of serious cinema. The film containes scene after scene which are unforgetable. An early work by one of the great directors of all time.The film went on to become a triology. It is difficult to describe the sensation of seeing it. One of infinite saddness but at the same time one can not but admire its beauty.
2,Sony DVD of Poor Quality,"This cinematic masterpiece has been brought out on DVD by ""Sony Pictures Classics"" and is, unfortunately, of poor quality. While I've not seen the ""Criterion Collection"" version being offered here, I certainly hope it's better than the Sony. What it looks like the latter has done is merely transfer the VHS version onto DVD without any digital enhancements. What a pity to do this to so fine a film. Yes, one can still get a feel for the work's quality, but it certainly doesn't help viewing a diffuse, aged print."
1,Good idea - Poor Quality,"I bought this in hopes of replacing one almost identical I bought from Walmart. The rabbit did not do what it was described to do. It was not able to jump. It tried to, but it didn't have enought power to lift itself. It was NOT the batteries, I replaced them numerous times in attempt to get it to work.It is pretty sad when a Walmart product held up and worked better than this. I was able to use the Walmart rabbit for 2 years and only because my daughter threw it down (she's 2), did it break."
5,Reviving a lost art,"Spinning and Dyeing is becoming a lost art to common knowledge. At one time, everyone did it or wanted to. I am not talking about the dark ages unless you consider the 60's and 70's dark ages. There were craft shops on every corner with the materials to accomplish these tasks. Now you can find specialty books and some specialty suppliers. However, you have to make an effort to find them.""Step By Step Spinning & Dyeing"" is a complete introduction to spinning & dyeing. There are line drawings, illustrations, and photographs to assist the excellent text. The equipment needed and even how to record progress is included.For those who are just interested but not ready to start from scratch there is a section on using what you made in knitting, macramé, and weaving."
4,an amazing result of previous albums,"my interesting in VNV nation probably started with the song ""Beloved"" I then began to discover the rest of the the Futurepop duo's past. I have listened to their previous 3 CDs (Empires, Praise the Fallen, and Advance and Follow,) and I think that Futureperfect shows how much the band has matured. ""Beloved,"" is a beautiful song, and still one of my favorites. ""Epicentre"" is a powerful song. And ""Electronaut"" is a nice instrumental. As a whole, the album is very complete and has a very specific sound to it."
5,I loves me some VNV,"I just picked up this CD about a week ago and have hardly been able to pry it out of my CD player since. This was actually the first VNV CD I had heard, though I bought ""Empires"" first. This disk is more of a mixed bag than ""Empires"", stylistically speaking, but I love it. My favorite tracks are ""Epicentre"", ""Electronaut"", ""Carbon"", and ""Structure"". I know a lot of reviewers have bitched about ""Electronaut"" being filler, but I like that song, dammit! I like that the lyrics are well thought-out as well...social conscience you can dance to. :)"
3,Not bad but not great,"I have to say I should have read the reviews here before buying this CD because I may have passed or waited till it was available used. Since the history of VNV Nation releases have been a staple of intense lyrical content and pulsing beats, I expected the same of this release. This has more of a ""soundtrack"" feel to it. More comparable to In The Nursery's Anatomy of a Poet. Still has the intensity but lacks drive. Perhaps a remix album should be done to spice it up for dancefloor compatability?"
3,I waited how long for this???,"Having been a VNV Nation fan for several years now, I was eagerly awaiting this new CD... Now that it's here, I think it is quite a bit of a disappointment in that I'm not sure what kind of category to put it into. The sound is something like a mix of spoken word, early VNV and Laibach experimental/ambient works. The multi language intro is not particularly inspiring, but the second and third (instrumental) tracks are good. After that, only Genesis is really worthy of mention. This is probably the only song that would receive any play at clubs are the rest are rather slow, instrumental or more like spoken word recitals."
5,Always been in the lineup,"So here's the quick version. Not too many people make 'albums' anymore, they make 'singles' and write a bunch of crud around it. Futureperfect would be worth the purchase because of 'Beloved' alone, but the buildup to it, and the tracks beyond it, frame the whole CD as an experience. I've been listening to this since it came out, and I still love it. When I go on any road-trip, I bring it along. When did it come out? I can't remember, but if you are only going to buy one VNV album, get this one. 'Empires' comes in a close second.Gah, what do you know about music anyway. I'm going to go listen to this now, and leave you behind in your ""Futureperfect'-less world. Good luck with that, sucker."
3,Disappointing,"I love VNV Nation, but Futureperfect is totally inferior to Empires in almost every respect.Musically, it sounds almost forceless, bassless and flimsy. This is probably due to the fact that most of the album was made with soft-synths. Previous albums like Praise The Fallen and Empires had music that was far more emotive, made you want to raise your fists in defiance, or cry.Lyrically, however, it shows a more melancholic side to VNV Nation, however, this is the only respect in which it shines.You may ask as to why I gave this CD 3 stars instead of two or one. The reason is that VNV is still far better than any form of pop music, and the lyrics are wonderful, and there are two songs that are good (Epicentre and Fearless (Beloved is overrated and far to candy-coated).Overall, it is not an important purchase except for VNV Fans. If you are just getting into VNV Nation, buy ""Empires"" instead!"
1,What a stinker,"Some people are fans and fair enough, but this is boring droll , uninspired........... as uninspired as this review."
3,It is strong where it is strong,"I was overjoyed when I heard that a new VNV CD was being released, but felt let down initally after hearing it. With tracks like Beloved and Hold On I was very happy, but I feel that Fearless and Epicentre are weak where they should be much stronger. The words to fearless just seem weak, and cheesy would be a better way of describing it."
4,The Future May Not Be Perfect But..............,"This is still a great cd despite a few tracks that just don't fit in with the beat driven force of ""Futureperfect"". There are at least three songs on this cd that I would call ""slow"". Also, some of the song go on and on. Still, when the BPMs are high VNV Nation doesn't mess around. The cd erupts with the deep industrial rave vibrations of ""Epicentre"", my pick for best track. Also, the all instrumental track ""Structure"" make this cd worth buying alone. This is definitely a different type of cd from VNV, but it can really give your speakers a work out. Four on the floor makes you want more."
5,VNV becoming the band to compare.,"Well with the latest album (CD) VNV have proved they can make great electronic music, and with Apoptygma Berzerk latest and disappointing release, Harmonizer. VNV has taken the mantle of best Electro band. ""Epicentre"" is my fave though they are all good...soon to become classic and must have for all DJ's."
4,The most mature album yet,"I have always liked VNV Nation and have been listening to them for a while. I loved Praise the Fallen and I thought the Darkangel remixes were quite good as well. Then I picked up Futureperfect and my whole outlook on this band changed. Wow. From beginning to end, this album exceeded my expectations. I was impressed by the emotional intensity of songs like ""Beloved"" and ""Epicentre"". This I feel is their most mature and diverse album both musically and lyrically. I would personally recommend this album to anyone who likes techno/industrial music."
4,"Futureperfect is a great album, but it doesn't top Empires","VNV Nation's new album Futureperfect is a bit of a departure in sound from Empires, unfortunately. Futureperfect is a very listenable album, but many of the songs just don't have the impact that the ones on Empires had. Genesis and Beloved are the only songs that hit me right away as outstanding. I guess I had high expectations since every track on Empires was a masterpiece. Some of the tracks on here could have been better if only they had the high bpm, energizing feel of Genesis. It's a shame because all of the lyrics on Futureperfect are ingenius, some of VNV's best yet. Hopefully VNV Nation will release a remix album that will pump new life into some of the slower songs. Despite that fault, I highly recommend this album to VNV Nation fans or anyone who likes industrial/EBM. Futureperfect is still a great album that overshadows all of the foolishness found in much of today's music."
3,Mask of Death aka Shaolin Devil and Shaolin Angel (1979),"There's a masked killer on the loose and and he is killing all of the martial worlds top fighters. Steve Tung Wei plays a young man who must go to learn kung fu to revenge his father after he is killed. Don Wong Tao also has a revenge driven role.This is an average kung fu movie, with a few nice touches that help it standout from the rest. Tung Wei is taught by a monk who sits on a small round padded seat. If Tung Wei can move the monk and sit on the seat himself then he has passed his training. This is one of my favorite training scenes of alltime. Tung Wei is flawless with his movements and has some very good acrobatic skills. But not to be outshined is Wong Tao. He gives a great performance in all of his fights. The movie also stars Choi Wang and Chen Sing.None of the fights are great, but they are still worth watching2.5/5Picture quality is a bit above average and its widescreen."
4,excellent film,i bought this one on a whim because it was cheapi was not dissapointedi'll watch again and again and againreally fun
1,THIS IS NOT A KUNG FU MOVIE,"I JUST ORDERED THIS AND I GOT A LORENZO LAMAS MOVIE FROM 2001, NOT THE KUNG FU MOVIE FROM 1976. BEWARE!!!"
3,Not what I expected.,"I have another tuck pointer in a different width from QLT by Marshalltown. It's a very nice trowel with tapered thickness to the blade that has some ""spring"" to it. While this trowel has QLT by Marshalltown on the handle it not at all like my other trowel. The blade is the same thickness with little spring to the blade. It looks similar to the kind you can buy at a mostly China made hardware store. This was not a very good value for me and I wish the picture and description would have been better. I'm sure it will work fine but not as well as one that has some spring to it for pushing mortar between the stones."
5,"Finally, a great Avon foundation!","I use this product in the lightest shade ""Ivory"".Usually, I absolutely hate Avon's foundations. They either had too much orange or too much red. I had swore them off. So, when I tried my mom's Beyond Color Mousse foundation in Ivory I was amazed! Perfect blending and flawless looking skin was the effect I was left with!This is even better than Estee Lauder's Ideal Matte foundation, which I used to like for my summer foundation. I have combination skin which is oily in the T-zone and tends to get dry around my lower cheeks, chin and forehead; this foundation works great for my skin type. I hope that Avon in all its infinite wisdom doesn't discontinue this foundation. I am going to stock up on it. Finally, a hit for Avon in the foundation market!NOTE: I've found that for this foundation to work as well as it can, you need to have smooth moisturized skin. If you have any dry patches it will highlight them."

Dont know how else to explain it.I tried wearing it twice, thinking maybe the first time I applied it wrong or something...But, same issuesI did not like at all.I am usually a liquid foundation wearer.When I purchased this, I also purchased Beyond Color Skin Smoothing Compact and I love it!"

2,Just wondering?,This addition has some good information but not very many worked problems. The section on morgages doesn't show how to do the math but how someone else figured the math. It would be nice to show how it was figured. I tried to find out on the internet but got no real answer. Is this a secret or maybe no one but the banks know how its done.Just Wondering.
3,Everyday Math for Dummies is good... if you're not so dumb.,"If many of the mathematical skills you learned in school are just sitting there at the edge of your brain, this book is probably for you. However, if you're trying to retrieve something you haven't done in years and are looking to be shown the hard math skills, you won't find it here."
3,A lot of marginally useful arithmetic,"I was looking for a book that reviewed basic math(i.e. grammar school multiplication, fractions, decimals, percentages, etc.) This book covered topics such as mortgages, how to calculate tips, etc. It wasn't a match."
3,"Opps, not the right ""Everyday Mathmatics"" book","This book was not what I wanted, but is useful all the same. I was looking for the new method of teaching math to children, it also is called EVERYDAY MATH - OR maybe it is called EVERYDAY MATHMATICS. regardless, it is useful and can be handed down to my daughter when she uses it from everything to balancing the check book to re-calculating recipies, etc."
2,Not What I Expected,I was expecting a math workbook and what I ended up with is more like a math text book. I was disappointed. This is not what I wanted.
3,"Not bad, but slightly dated.","Certainly has a lot of good stuff to it, but the 1995 print date makes it feel a little behind the times (when he's using examples - obviously math itself has not changed). Could have been a bit clearer on certain subjects considering that a person buying the ""Dummies"" books probably wants it put as simply as possible. He kinda assumes you know certain things, which a book of this nature shouldn't do. Still pretty easy to pick up on though, even if you have to read a chapter twice to do so. Only other real complaint is that a lot of the subject matter is not, in fact, everyday common math. Recommended if you can get it for under $10."
5,A Great Soundtrack,"The soundtrack to Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda is one of the best sci-fi soundtracks to come out in quite a while. I found the music exciting, interesting and intriguing, and on several tracks simply exhilarating; composer Matthew McCauley really does take you on a musical roller-coaster, from the stately High Guard Theme to Dylan's theme to Trance's and Beka's themes to the Nietzschean Attack theme. McCauley musically explores each character, underscoring and enhancing their unique personality. The album has kind of a New Age-ish sound to it on several tracks which gives it a mysterious ethereal quality. A great score for a great series. Composer Matthew McCauley certainly knows his stuff. This is just great music whether or not you're a fan of the show!"
4,hunger and surrender,"total surrender to God's purpose for my life came out of reading this book, my will, emotions, heart and plans for his plan for my life. Iam so hungry for Him,to be filled with his agenda and not mine. To go after him as never before, to be filled with His fulness, his Holy Spirit, to answer the call of God on my life, to stop dancing around the cross and GET ON THE CROSS! There is a price to pay for the demonstration of His Power and the required price is to DIE TO SELF! I also purchased the two other books, Glory, Revival Glory."
5,Covers a lot of stuff that simply isn't covered elsewhere.,Just today I purchased a copy of the Desktop Java Live book. I'm very impressed. It covers a lot of stuff that simply isn't covered elsewhere. It was money well spent.
5,The best Feng Shui guide!,"""Activate Your Luck"" is the best Feng Shui DVD on the market today! It is a real Feng Shui guide/manual. Feng Shui experts show you how to rearrange your home and office according to Feng Shui principals. I like that they used all real homes and offices. I did a lot of rearrangements in my home and office according to these videos and I love it!The videos are very entertaining and fast-paced."
4,Good Gift,"It has everthing you need for a Blackjack game! Only draw back is it doesn't come in case, they are individual pieces."
1,Just another waste of time,"I should have known better than reading a book Dr. Phil recommended.The two authors have NO CREDENTIALS. I thought they were psychologists or something but they are NOT doctors at all. This ""book"" is just a bunch of blank spaces where you're supposed to write down details about when you've procrastinated and why, with useless quotes on each page about how awful procrastination is. The writing style is unprofessional and confusing. You keep reading and reading, waiting for the information to help you ""own your time and your life"" but it never comes. Instead you get a series of not-so-subtle quizzes with questions like:When you have to buy concert tickets, you:A) Buy them immediatelyB) Buy them later when the price increasesC) Forget to buy themD) Commit suicideSo basically the book's only advice is ""stop procrastinating."" Very helpful indeed."
1,Don't Bother,"This ""book"" is a total sham. Thankfully I checked this out from the library and did not spend one red cent on this. I am here to do a public service announcement to warn my fellow readers to STAY AWAY from this ""book."" There are a grand total of three pages which discuss procrastination: Introduction, What is Procrastion, Why does Procrastination Happen. There are four more pages in the Tools for Change section. After that you're on your own folks! The remaining 155 or so pages are filled with nothing but quizzes, a to do list etc. Sheer nonsense. You're better off printing a to do list and conducting some procrastination quizzes for free off of the net."
3,"Interesting, but incorrect.","As typical of Milada Broukal books, this book is sufficiently varied and interesting, but wildly inaccurate and misleading with much of its information."
2,Disappointed in these gingher scissors,"I am disappointed in these gingher embroidery scissors. I have another pair of gingher embroidery scissors that I purchased MANY years ago that are still excellent. The ones I just purchased are much too stiff, and we were unable to loosen them. In addition, they started squeaking. We oiled them; the squeaking stopped but then returned"
1,El libro está 100% en ingles,"No es ni similar a lo que aparece en la publicacion, el libro esta 100% ingles y los versos asi como los orikis estan en ingles, pero no en yoruba. NO me gustó para nada"
3,Good content for introduction. Poor Editing,"Baba Fasina Falade's content in this book makes a very good introduction to the Ifa faith. It sets the groundwork for further exploration and learning. In this manner, I feel this is an excellent compilation. I commend Fasina Falade for his work. Of equal value is the strong and enlightening forward by Adeosun Ifalade. The forward is effective in opening one's mind and building enthusiasm to read the rest of the book. The dissatisfaction I have with this book is in the editing. There are annoying typographical errors throughout the text. At times, these errors make reading somewhat difficult. This is the ONLY reason that I do not give this book a higher rating."
5,a book that will bring you to new understandings,"Aboru aboye abosise Baba Fasina Falade I have just finished reading the book Ijo Orunmila by Baba Fasina Falade. This book is absoluetly wonderful. It has brought my understandings of the traditions to a new level.I can not convey enough good words about this book. It helps one learn about the traditions of the ancestors of Ile Ife. I give my most humble suggestion for anyone who is interested in African traditions and/or culture to get this book. This book , i believe, is for everyone and will help anyone find what it is they are looking for. I personally thought this book was so good that I plan on getting every book by this publishing company. David ps. if you wish to ask me questions about this book please email me at ServiLoa@aol.com"
5,Great job,"I'm very pleased with my order. The book arrived quickly, and is in great shape. And so much cheaper than buying at my college bookstore! I'll definitely be back!"
4,My 2006 Nissan Frontier,"I installed this AVS product on my 2006 Nissan Frontier... After reading all the ""Product specs"" on it & many others, I decided on it because I ""thought"" it was going to be TALLER and cover more of my hood, but I think ALL the measurements given are WAY off! I'm not saying it doesn't look good, it fits fine... I had just hoped for a TALLER shield!"
4,"Great product, catches leaves.","Installation couldn't have been easier, it looks great, and seems to be keeping bugs (and rocks) off my windshield. It can be fun watching the leaves fly out of it in the morning in the fall, however, since it seems to be the preferred resting spot for them. Overall, I would definitely buy it again!"
4,What an incredible voice!,LM Pagano is one of the greatest jazz singers today - comparible to Ella Fitzgerald. Her voice is amazing! I look forward to hearing more from her in the future. What a great album!
2,"Beautiful picture of the tiger, but a very thin mouse pad",This mouse pad is so thin that I don't think I can use it for more than 1 year.
2,"Sterilized, but still good","What I was hoping for was a clean version of my totally worn out album...What I got was a sterilized version of music that seems to be loved by all the reviewers (and who can't love music from the musicians that assembled to help a noble cause), but is so terribly different than the album.Little things... like hearing the countdown before While My Guitar Gently Weeps, or tuning before a song and stage banter is all lost on the CD. It's like the CD is trying to be a studio album.And then, theres the ""A couple numbers from Leon..."" while the songs are done well, they are not the version that was on the LP and it is our loss.Oh well - I'll invest in software and hope to clean up the LP import... anything to get the Jumpin' Jack Flash/Youngblood medley right!"
2,Intellectual property laws should stop this!,I had read many reviews stating that the listeners believed that this remaster had many of the original audience and backup singer's input removed. This certainly is the case. My biggest disappointment with this reissue is that the version of Jumpin' Jack Flash/Youngblood by Leon Russell is most definitely NOT the one that was on the original release. It is the same version that is in the DVD and that has always been different to the audio release. In my opinion the original version is far superior to this one.I find it amazing that Olivia Harrison let this be put in the public domain. It is a travesty to what was originally laid down on tape and mixed by George and Phil Spector. What next? A moustache on the Mona Lisa in the hope that no-one notices?
4,A Classic Music CD,The music is great on this cd and it came in remarkable time. The cover was a little mussed by nothing bad and the Cd is like new.
5,Different version of Leon Russell's songs,"The remastered edition actually has a different version of Leon Russell's songs. It must have been from the other show. Both are good. I like the original version a bit better because the chorus really got into the interplay with Leon. In the remastered, it's a bit more subdued. It also explains the lack of introduction by George Harrison."
1,Why change the original cover?,It was so thoughtless to have changed the original cover which meant something. From what we have read George was a humble person. The producers have ignored the feelings of so many people.Why George Harrison and friends? Was it not Ravi Shankar's original plea and idea? I am sure George is fuming.
1,Packaged wrong,I bought two of these and both have the same tracks on both disc 1 and 2. I assume there has been a mistake in the production. Got credit on the frst one and waiting for the credit onn the second one.
4,Clinical Anesthesiology,It is a good basic book that covers the essentilas very clearly in not too long chapters. It is a good entry level book for doctors during their first year of residence in anesthesia.Also for the doctor that needs to update his knowledge.My personal experience and the reason for buying the book was that I after 5 years i neuroanesthesia needed an update prior to a period as an anesthesiologist in a not specialised department. In this way the book served its purpose well.
5,Great reference book,M&M is a great clinical reference book. It is very easy to follow and read. I supplemented it in place of other books because of its clarity.
4,Great British Adult Comedy,"It's ""Sex in the City"" only better - all the ins and outs, ups and downs of modern couples, only in this series you have both the male and the female point of view. Very funny and entertaining, for people in the UK and the USA alike!"
1,Not very funny and the laughs in the background are a turn-off,Not very funny and the laughs in the background are a turn-off. Will be looking for some other free prime content.
2,Hated It - Couldn't wait to be uncoupled,"This is really a dreadful show.The acting is stiff and the canned laughter is even sillier.I had to watch every episode of this disc, but I did not like this series. Stick with French and Sanders, A League of Gentlemen, and AbFaf, but skip this one. But how can you? You have to see it to believe how bad it is, it's not even ""it's so bad, it's good."" They should have been more original and they should stop stooping low for the laughs. A disappoitment. Hope the series gets better."
4,Good Season,I liked this season it was so funny i only didn't like 1 episode. The Coupling cast is so great i like all of them espcially Jane and Jeff their funny. I can't wait till season 4 but it's sad that jeff ain't going to be there.
2,It is just not funny!,"It was a long time since I have watched British sitcom. I heard about this show and decided to give it a try. I couldn't finish it: I switch it off in the middle of the fourth episode. There are a few laughs there but to get to those laughs you have to sit through totally boring stuff. Plus the acting is so bad, so wooden... I give it two stars just for those very few laughs I mentioned"
5,"Hilarious!! If you like Friends, you'll love Coupling!!","For those of you out there who like Friends, you should definitely watch Coupling. It's raunchier, sexier more funny than anything you've ever seen on American television. I could not stop laughing from the first episode where Jane refuses to accept that Steve has broken up with her to the last episode where Jane is afraid she is a star in one of Patricks videos. It's a must see!!!"
5,Great series!,"This is hilarious...although I did miss a few British references and slang the first time around, it didn't take too much to pick up on it. Its still a riot. Even have my husband watching this and he finds it funny too."
5,The best of recent British comedy!,"Forget the comparisons to Friends...this one stands on its own with superb writing, honest comedy, and some great eye-candy in the female characters. Geoff's quirky theories and catch phrases are both funny and truthful...you'll find yourself thinking of the ""giggle loop"" and ""nudity buffer"" at the strangest times.This USA version of the Season 1 DVD includes the extras from the European version of the Season 2 DVD...go figure."
5,The Giggle Loop,"Coupling is the best show besides Red Dwarf to come out of England! I loved watching the show and laughed every second of it. If you've never watcxhed the show before think of it as Friends, except they have English accents and talk about sex all the time. My favorite character is Jeff(poor thing can never talk to a girl without blurting out some part of the female anatomy!). I guaranty that if you buy this first season you will laugh through the whole thing."
5,Everything You'd Want from a British Sitcom,"I've always loved English humor and have been a fan of everything from ""Monty Python"" to ""The Goodies"" to ""Fawlty Towers.""I haven't kept up on watching much from England but a friend loaned me his first volume of ""Coupling"" and it had everything I enjoy from British television. The writing is very sharp and the laughs keep coming.I look forward to seeing the second season."
5,Great watch!,"I love this watch! It's easy to take on and off. This is the second one I've bought. Plus, I received it in a timely manner!"
5,the best stalin book,"Few books could ever encapture the paranoid mass murder machine that stalin created , it was a reflection of his totally sociopathic and parannoid personality. This one come close to detailing in detail how stalin created one of histories most bloodthirsty regimes. It was a machine of death basically always looking for new victims to be fed into it. This captures stalin for all his faults a few good aspects. Yes, even he had a few good points but they were few to be sure. Newer books have come out but this one is still probably the best one out there. It's a good read and it moves pretty fast too. History is not boring it's a bloodbath and filled with twists and turns and only the most twisted history was encompassed under stalins reign which did at least modernize the soviet union. And that fact as well as the many purges and murders stalin oversaw are detailed here in clarity."
4,It solved a problem,I keep two sponges and a couple of brushes up on the sink top. One of the sponges is strictly for washing dishes so I keep it on one side of the sink area and the other sponge and brushes on the other side of the sink. I needed something that did not rust; this is the perfect solution. It fits the area and is easy to keep clean. I couldn't ask for more.
5,Made great,This is a high end quality sink tray. It looks great and it does the job. Can't say enough about the quality...
5,Its a sink tray,My wife wanted a simple sink tray and let me tell you there impossible to find in stores. Finally found this little tray and its perfect.
2,Functional at best,"Purchased this to match the stainless steel sink in out kitchen. It has a rubberized bottom to prevent it from sliding around and it does match well. However, that is where the praise ends. We have only had it a short time and it is already showing signs of spotting and rust. It must be made of cheap stainless steel or who knows what. I am disappointed and will be searching for a replacement."
2,Not so stainless or??,My wife bought this item for me about 4 years ago. It now is rusting in spots and leaving a rust-like stain or drip on the counter. It looks like real stainless and seems well made so I don't know what to think except I'm going to replace it with something else.KDM
2,Average,"I own the first one and I must say that I was expecting better in the second one. But the first one was more of TV specials and hilarious clips. This second one is a concert and behind the scenes for the movie they made. It was okay but I didn't love it like I loved the first one :(. It's a rent, I wouldn't bother buying it."
2,Not as good as the first D DVD,"Concert dvd was sub par for my fav. comedian JB. The special features and behind the scenes were good, but nothing too great. Buy it if you absolutely love the D and JB. Otherwise, skip it."
4,"great doc, so so concert","Doc on disc 2 is great so is the time travel skit and music vids, but I gotta say the concert got a little tiring. More D is always a good thing but alot of these songs are well played out. And I think the addition of the full band kills alot of what makes the D special. Dvd is definetly worth buying especially for the 2nd disc but I can't rate this a whole 5 stars. That said hopefully their next album brings fresh feeling back to the Ds concerts."
3,"Interesting, but unfinished?","I guess much like some relationships, I felt like this book ended a bit abruptly.It is definitely a book that everyone can relate to, although I couldn't help but feel like it could've been more finished.I enjoyed it. It was a quick read. It will make you feel like you and those close to you are a little closer to ""normal.""Nothing stands out as ""WOW"" ""Oh my"" ""Boom"" or I learned ...this from the book, but it was an entertaining peek into the window of two other peoples lives and their relationship."
1,Mundane,This book is ridiculous. If Jeff Brown can write a book--ANYONE can. The art if horrible and the writing MUNDANE ! Don't waste your time.
1,A continuation of badness and exploitation,I feel bad for the ex-girlfriends of Jeffrey Brown. These books are awful and boring at the same time.
5,Classic Aviator with Browbar,"The standard G-15 lens that served our pilots during WWII missions.The first Aviator sunglasses were made by Ray-Ban for World War II pilots. They needed glasses to eliminate sunlight and glare, and provide the best possible vision amid smoke and flying debris.Ray-Ban designed the iconic tear-drop frames to mimic the shape of pilot goggles and cover a maximum amount of real estate around each eye.General Douglas MacArthur put Aviators Sunglasses on the map in 1944 when he landed on the beach in the Philippines wearing a pair of the tear-drop shades.Aviators made a resurgence in popularity when Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer sported them in the 1986 action flick Top Gun. Since then they have been a mainstay in celebrity style and fashion."
4,Classic,"Great set of classic glasses. The glass in the lens's are heavier than normal glasses you get today. knock-offs are simply not the same,"
5,Great product but shipping sucks!,"The bottle fit my needs to a T. But for something that cost about 1.50$ the shipping was about 8$. Really, there is no need to ship it to me Priority Mail. UPS would have been just fine."
5,What are bottle thread dimentions ????,"PLEASE ADVISE - what are the dimensions of the thread-neck of the bottle? Please write here - its outside thread diameter, and how many threads vertically in what distance? Thanks."
5,Stokowski Was Born to Conduct Carmen,"Although well-known, Leopold Stokowski for some reason never quite receives the respect that other famous conducting names garner. This is a shame, because at the top of his game Stokowski simply leaves his peers to shake their heads in wonderment at his ability to produce colors from an orchestra.In these two pieces by Bizet Stokowski takes the long gone British National Philharmonic - created for recordings - and precedes to elicit playing quite as exciting as the best in these over-recorded selections. What distinquishes Stokowski's way in Bizet is his remarkable sensitivity, his light touch, effortlessly incorpoarted into a floating rythmic propulsion; all this decorated with lavish displays of instrumental colors.As fine a piece of conducting as you can hope to hear in these works, a wonderful momento of this legendary leader at his best, and an absolute top choice for someone wishing to own this music on CD."
1,Do not buy!,My husband (Jewish) and I (Christian) were given this book as a gift. We both read it indiviually and both had the same reaction: It is written in a very biased way. The authors portray the Christian religion as superficial. Case studies are used throughout to make their point- you must choose Judaism if your children are to grow up with a firm sense of self and belonging. (Christianity as the chosen religion does not seem to be an option with the authors). I do not recommend this book and neither would my husband. We threw it out.
4,Thought provoking,"Andrea King's book challenges us to consider some thought provoking dialogue and considerations on the always controversial subject of religious upbringing in an interfaith family.This book portrays how 2 families dealt with the hotly debated topic in 2 different ways and the outcome of those decisions.As the author raises issues for couples to address, she in no way suggests there is a perfect answer. The book merely gets our minds moving in the direction of communicating with each other our feelings and thoughts with regards to some of the future decisions we might find ourselves facing as a family.I highly recommend this book for interfaith families as a good start to communicating religious differences and decisions."
3,Great Music...Very Poor Reproduction,"Beyond a doubt, ""That's All"" was (and is) among the greatest albums in the nightclub genre. HOWEVER, this CD sounds as if it were remastered from some,... worn-out cassette tape. Musically, this album rates 5 stars, and the music is SO great that I still give it 3, even though the sound ""quality"" is so utterly ...[wrong]."
3,I expected more.,Bobby did well but the one song on the album I brought it for did not measure up to expectations.
1,Don't Touch This CD!,"I suppose I should have known better! You only get what you pay for, so what can you expect for $1.99. Obviously produced from vinyl, there is a major glitch in ""Mack The Knife"", with vinyl crackles throughout the rest of the album, even though some form of noise reduction has been utilised. The Pickwick company has been churning out poor quality re-issues for donkeys' years, and if I'd known it was one of theirs I wouldn't have touched it with a barge pole! BE WARNED!"
4,Music Explorer,"Cd had some very good songs, catchy with a good beat. Didn't like all songs though, some songs had too much pop in them. If you like pop music you'll love this cd. But if you are like me and prefer a harder sound/rock you will not like all the songs. Don't be discouraged cd has some very good songs, loved Pride, go ahead and check the song out on you tube, pretty good. Overall cd is worth buying."
5,GREAT!,Wow! This girl has some pipes! What can I say she has more talent rolled into her than Mandy Moore and Brtiney Spears rolled into one (that would be a verygood thing though). If this isnt already in your collection get it now!
5,I wanna love you forever,I wanna love u forever is a great song everyone should have this CD at home this is one of the best songs i evere heard before. Jessica is a great singer she really knows how to sing.
2,Jessica Simpson,"I hate to admit this, but I like the song ""I wanna love you forever."" The reason I don't like to admit it is because I really, really hate Jessica Simpson. I saw her when she opened up for 98* and she sounded really bad in person."
1,I Hate This B-=[/,I don't wanna lover her forever. I'd rather love me forever. I wonder if it is against the law to marry yourself.
1,screech much?,"ugh. i'm sorry, her voice is so flat, and screechy..i cannot STAND it! i like the song, but it's obvious she used her love connection with nick lachey to get somewhere."
2,Decent Voice but Overdone,"When I first heard this single, my honest thought was, ""what's this song Mariah Carey's trying to pull off? This is excessive even for her."" I think that kind of sums it up. Jessica Simpson has a decent voice, but she sounds like Mariah Carey's apprentice (even the lyrics are Carey-esque) instead of developing her own style. While the beginning of the song isn't bad (and the only reason this got 2 stars), when the song reaches it's climax, a point at which she's obviously trying to show off her vocal prowess, she sounds more like she's shouting at her lover than praising him. It's reminiscent of campy 80's love songs. She's aiming for the new age ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"", but ended up with an overdone song that could have been decent if she'd just relax and didn't try so hard."
1,AS BAD AS A SONG GOES,"I've only heard I wanna love you forever and at first I thought that it was the kind of song that someone would write in 3 minutes. When I found out that it was a real song and that was on a c.d. I nearly fell over, then when I found that she was touring with Ricky Martin I did fall over! I know that Spice Girls were bad, but at least they don't what to make you chop your ears off. They must have paid Jessica millions to sing this horrible song, and then embarass herself by letting everyone know that she sung it. And I thought that Lenny Craviz' American Woman was bad. JESSICA, IF YOU EVER READ THIS STICK TO YOUR DAY JOB, YOU'LL NEED IT, NO KIDDING! If you want to hear quality music you should listen to Kiss 106.1"
2,not the worst voice; not the best.,"jessica simpson has talent. more than say, britney spears or mandy moore. but, i find that, unlike christina aguilera and mariah carey, she has no treble to her voice, which, when she reaches high notes, sounds like she's screaming. that really bugs me.. it's ear piercing, annoying, and not the best type of a voice to listen to. she can improve."
2,This album is not like I thought it would be!,"Well, after listening to several songs on the album, I tried to like it, but I could not. She has an okay voice and maybe if she had better songs, the record would work. I don't know where the Christina Aguilera comparisons come from, the two sound nothing alike. I ought to know I have Christina's album. I do think Jessica's song ""I want to love you forever is pretty good"". Ballads are her strong point."
1,cheap and flimsy,I received this item rolled up and dented! Not efficient at all! Too big for someone's home and too cheap looking for an office. I did not send it back because I didn't need the hassle. I ended up cutting it and using 2 of the months and I had to use thumb tacks just to keep the thing flat! Don't buy it unless you can see and touch it. The picture was very misleading.
1,Not for dry erase,Can't write on it with dry erase markers and erase easily...not really made for dry erase. Really kinda stinks ....just too lazy to return it
5,It's a GREAT System.,"This system allows you to hang your camera or lens from a strap, or from your backpack or your photographers vest, and very quickly change your arrangement.I frequently have several long lenses hanging, plus two bodies. I can drop a camera, have it fall on the strap and move to another camera. I still caution you to be careful tough. I once dropped a Hasselblad SWC from a train car because I sadly ASSUMED it was on a strap. It was not harmed at all.Back to the product, if you want to work fast and you don't want seven straps around your neck, this is the way to go.Also, I had fast shipping, and I needed it because I was covering a Shuttle launch from the press area."
3,Not about the Appalachian Trail!!,"Though this video uses the Appalachian Trail as a point of commonality tying together the four states mentioned, it is NOT ABOUT THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL. Hikers looking for information on the A.T. should look elsewhere. With a title beginning with ""Appalachian Trail"", the video is annoyingly deceiving in its subject matter. It is merely a tourist video, discussing historic sites that offer guided tours."
3,Nostaglic but has audio problems,"I would rate this CD a 5 if they had used the original tapes to do it. But apparently they used another source, probably a decent LP copy. The top end is very much distorted, its nothing like it sounded on LP, especially on a good stereo. I am going to get another copy, just to make sure I dont have a bad CD. These songs bring back many childhood memories of my Dad's stereo, and this LP playing full throttle on it in absolute clarity. No one plays music like this anymore. Enjoy."
2,Fabulous Money worth it,"I listed this with Amazon not thinking there was a snowball change of getting a copy of it but within 3 months, they notified me that they now had used CD's listed. I had too pay for it but think it was worth every penny."
2,Not for me,"Although there were parts of this book that I found useful, I found the overall tone to be a bit too hardline. My son has just turned 2 and is showing a lot of interest in potty training (he spends part of the week with a trained 3 yr old) but I don't think he's ready to go into underpants which is the only way forward in this book. I much prefer Keys to Toilet Training by Meg Zweiback - it takes a slower, more relaxed approach while still dealing with all the possible issues. It's based on the work of T. Berry Brazelton so if anyone really liked his book Touchpoints, which I found incredibly useful the first year, then they'll probably prefer Ms Zeiback's approach."
5,Lots of great ideas!,"I was having trouble with my toddler in terms of bowel retention and other icky things, so I bought this book. I tried the Playdough Fun Factory idea, and one day my daughter said, ""Look, Mommy, it's pooping!"" Within a week she was using the toilet normally, and we haven't looked back since. When I tell people this story, they can't believe it, but it sure worked for us!"
2,Not very helpful,This book is a collection of stories about parents potty training their children. I couldn't quite get a plan of action or specific answers out of it. Kind of like reading a novel when you want an instruction book.
3,Nothing I hadn't already read...,"A great book overall, but I thought it fairly redundant after reading the Dummies potty training book. A good reference, but I didn't see anything in it that I hadn't already read or known about on my own."
5,"BUY IT, IT'S GREAT!!!","Offers GOOD, PRACTICAL advice for the approach to toilet training, as well as handling every one else's comments (or criticisms) about how you're doing it! Entirely comprehensive; complete with ""Stories from the Bathroom"" about REAL parents with REAL problems. A very enjoyable read!"
2,"Warning - ponderous performance, dull sound.","I must caution readers against the previous misleading review. Only the scherzo is brisk in the Furtwängler tempo. The 3 big movements are all slower than Jochum's later recordings (except the final 1986 Concergebouw) and slower still than Furtwängler, with which it scarcely bears comparison. In this '35 version Jochum whips up the last 1 minutes of the first movement in the way Furtwängler did, but the previous twenty are comparatively stodgy. The sound doesn't help matters as the dull, slightly muffled quality robs the music of much textural detail.The best representatives of Jochum in this work are the 1958 DG Bavarian RO and the 1964 Philips Concertgebouw recordings. This issue is for ""completists"" and Jochum fans only !"
5,FABULOUS,I bought 2 of these for my girls and they are soooo cute. Very well made and a sweet pattern too. I must also add that the fit was right on. I went by the size chart that Tuga provides and they fit great. I only used the waist measurement. Very pleased all around!
4,Does the job..,"This is the second hanging shoe bag I purchased, works just as well and does the job, just wish the compartments were a little bit wider! Works well with flip flops, flats and heels (that aren't too high!)."
5,"Ashley Rose was just a normal kid, until she turned 13. . .","When Ashley turned 13, she fell through the ice, and her life was never the same again. She discovered she had silver blood, along with some pretty amazing powers, which I don't want to spoil for you. I think this is the best Mindwarp book, and Ashley is my favorite character."
5,The book was faboulas it was the best,The mindwarp book had a lot of cliff hangers and made me read non stop. Jack was my favorite charecter he was funny and serios at times.I read the first two books and they were good and i plan on reding the rest.
5,1 of the best books you'll ever read,"I have had the worst time trying to decide my favourite mindwarp book between 9,7,2 and 1. today it's 2 but tomorrow it could be anything,the point is I totally love all of the mindwarp books and have read all of them.Ashley is by far my favourite,I wish I could be just like her.In this book she only just discovers her powers, she discovers Ethan also has powers,Ashley discovers...something to do with her blood an ""alien"" tries to kill her and succeeds... I shall not say more.I would like to say I am the biggest Mindwarp fan truthfully,but I read when someone else said that and felt hurt that she thought that she could possibly be a bigger fan than me.I read them every day, have spent about $75 for 2 books of my own money and gotten 7 books for christmas.I haven't read a non-mindwarp book since Christmas...you can judge who's the biggest fan."
3,"SHORT,But Supensefull.","I found that the book had a weak plot, but was very supensefull.It had a great way of scarring you to death,mainly because you didnt know what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to anyone who is just starting to take interist in reading"
5,MindWarp,"These mind warp books are so kool. But I'm more into L.J. Smith, but Cris Archer is pretty kool. Ashely Rose seems kinda like me before when I used to wear black all the time but right now I'll wear different colors((Except pink and others like that those are disgusting colors)).Ashley so far is my fav. charector but right now i only have 1,2,3,and9. But I'm gettin 4 and 5 soon.In the first book Ethen Rogers reminds me of my brother cause my brother loves comics. And I think it's kool that Cris Archer makes it look like these are real people my age((I'm 13)).So I think that's really kool.So I can't wait till I read the rest.BYE!"
1,automatic writing and hieroscripting,"Don't waste your money. This book is, without a doubt, the worst piece of trash I have ever come across."
3,Needed to be repaired prior to working.,"Arrived damaged and bent. I was not able to set the trap.This is very disappointing.the other two brands I purchased at the same time, arrived in the same box and worked just fine.I called customer support and conferred with my neighbor. we straightened the bent bits and it works!"
5,"Finally, a trap that works for me","We had two gophers destroying different parts our yard for over a month. This trap got both of them in one day. In the past I have tried ever escalating means of getting rid of gophers. Water hose, moth balls, treating the lawn with repellents, black hole plastic tube trap, gas bombs and poison bait. The only thing that ever worked for me was the poison but I never felt comfortable using poison in my yard and to make matters worse we now have a dog. I searched the web and found recommendations for the Macabee gopher trap. I ordered the traps from Amazon, set up them up in accordance with the provided instructions and by the next morning I had my two gophers. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
1,Do Not Buy!,"These traps are just like all the other cheaply made spring traps on the market: Set it once, and the green paint from the spring pin wears off and from that point on the trap is unusable. The trap relies on friction of the paint to hold the spring pin into the activation trigger.Also, these traps are MADE IN CHINA, not MADE IN USA like some other reviewers state.False advertising all the way around, and a total rip off.I will buy a box trap from here on."
5,"Bye, bye gophers","Got our first gopher, first try!Hey, these things actually work. We've been plaqued here in Colorado with these miserable creatures for years. Gardens were reduced to over-grazed wildernesses. Plants would get pulled below ground before our eyes. Nothing else has worked (except an occasional lucky bullet or maybe a cat). Forget all the other methods: flooding, poison, bombs, sonic, etc. This is what you need.Setting the trap isn't especially easy. The spikes are menacing. See [...] for a good tutorial.Somewhat disappointed with the Made in China label. I was under the impression it was US made. But the quality seems OK.Worth the price!"
5,"Ah, the grandeur of it!","Awesome in its purity, unity and majesty! The tempo is excellent. It neither drags nor flies by too fast. The power of the First Movement in particular swoops down like a violent, cleansing but controlled wind; it lifts you up and carries you to symphony heaven. The quartet/choral performance in the Fourth Movement is equally compelling and successfully realized. I am no sound expert, but on my car stereo every note I heard, instrumental and vocal, was crisp and REAL. A superb execution of one of classical music's greatest works."
1,old news,"Revolutionary! ha Making money by satisfying customer wants and needs is nothing new. Anyone in marketing or strategy already should save their money and time. The case studies in the book don't always make sense and there is a lot of repetition. It may be good for people learning the basic principles of consumer business or marketing, but there's nothing in here you wouldn't learn in business school."
4,"Nice, but where is Sailor Venus?","Sailor Moon is a great show, but if you're new to it and want to see all the scouts at their best, or are a fan of Saior Venus and this is your first DVD, buy the next one too. Sailor Venus only apears twice, and you never see her transform. Her attack is used twice, and we don't even learn about her human identity! Sailor Moon is really a great show, but buy in bulk when buying the DVDs."
2,Sanyo Xacti HD2,"This is a high quality camera that is not real easy to use. The docking station takes some effert to get a good connection, you just have to feel around until it is docked. The real disappointment is the software the camera linked with a touch of the button but after a week of trying I never did get a MP4 file to load into the computer. I was able load some files out of the camera with other software but not with the programs that came in the box. Where is their quality control? If the software had been of the same quality as the camera and the price had been $200.00 less, I would still have the camera."
2,Poor performance/quality in low light,"I bought this thinking that wow I get HD quality and decent still pictures all in one compact size device. When I received it, I was happy with the size it is really very small and feels good also.However, was terribly disappointed with the video quality especially in low light conditions. I knew that low light is not great based on other reviews but it was so bad that in side a decently lit room at night the quality was very grainy.I give two starts because:1. Still camera very very good. - you get 10x optical zoom which is great.2. Video Recording during day light out doors was decent3. Size and feel are greatDownsides:1. Very poor quality when recording indoors2. Very poor quality when recording in low light"
3,Handy Little Camera,"I got this camera because it was the deal of the day and was $480. I'm not much a videographer. But it is a very nice little camera, takes decent photos, and sharp videos. It's compact so you don't need to leave it behind. Who knows, maybe you'll catch the next Rodney King video. My only real complaint is that it outputs in MP4 format and the software that is included with the camera is pretty pathetic.But for something this size and quality, you'd have to spend a lot more.I don't even think that the low light performance is as bad as some people are making it out to be. I've shot several vids of my parrots inside and they came out quite nice.Pleased with this camera..."
1,dismal service again,order was not sent because of credit card problems said a voice I could not understand. this camera and last one purchased sent with no cd programs for operating camera. I will never buy anything from amazon again and want no further emails from amazon.
2,Disappointing Performance & Software,"With this pup it is simple to record video or images and almost impossible to download them successfully! In standard mode, the playback of video is anything but smooth. Looks like an old time movie.The software could best be described as, ""User Hostile"". I haven't been able to download any videos without getting an error message before the transfer is complete.The normal video isn't as good as my DV camcorders and downright sad indoors. The photo portion is slightly better than my cell phone (a pocket pc). Still pictures haven't downloaded successfully either (approximately 11 out of 185 have made it across the wire before error messages start interrupting the transfer).It's a handy size and easy to operate. After you're done recording you'll likely spend a lot of time with the manual (I have) and then you start getting frustrated.If I could return it, I would."
4,Great camera,"Seeing some of the other comments, and as the owner of an HD1 and an earlier version (C5?), there's a couple of points to make:* MP4 playback software that actually works was hard to find. It looks like the latest Real Player is ok, so long as your PC is fast. There are probably other usable software products as well now. Movies I took 2 years ago that seemed jerky on playback at the time now play ok using later software versions.* You do need to make sure you get high speed SD memory cards. Slow ones will spoil the whole experience. It does take the new SDHC cards, make sure they're at least class 4 cards.Reading the manual is key to happiness with the Xacti - I thought the flash had broken, until I read the right bit of the book! Once you've got the settings right, you don't need to touch it again."
2,big disappointment,I just had a Pampered Chef party and bought 3 of these. One for me and two for gifts. I am so disappointed they are all going back. The woman demonstrated using a lime. Maybe this works great for lime but not for a large lemon which is what I would use it most for. The lemon is too large and even my adult son could not get it to squeeze correctly. I much prefer the regular juicer.
4,Good introduction to Thai,"This is a good basic introduction to Thai massage. The photography and production are good and it's done in real time. Having said that, it is not a substitue for actual training, and there are no contraindications given on the video (the book is a great addition to the video and has alot of information). Of the numerous Thai massage videos that I have seen, this is the closest to my Thai training, including many ""asian"" teaching videos. Watch the video and then go get trained. You'll be one step ahead of everybody else in class!"
4,This comes off as more of a Rev. Run solo effort,"But that's not neccessarily a bad thing. DMC is apparently working on a solo effort of his own that will be out later this year. I agree that this isn't a classic Run DMC album, but then again, who expected it to be? All in all, it is a very well-crafted, very good album, and should be treated as that. ... A lot of the rock compilations come off really well, even from people I hate(Jenkins, Durst). The purely hip-hop CD's stand out, and the CD seems to have a very common theme throughout in the melodies of the songs. Its not going to be my favorite CD in my collection, but I'm definately going to enjoy listening to it."
1,I would give this negative stars if I could,"I was extremely disappointed with this album. This is a RUN solo album. And it's not a great one at that. I only wish that JMJ had not been killed, so that they could have come correct and made up for this lackluster effort. This album makes 1990's Back From Hell sound like a classic. If this were a Run Album, I might have given it 2 and a half stars. To call this a RUN-DMC album with DMC barely being on it at all is ludicrous. I always preferred DMC anyway. To get the true RUN-DMC experience, buy RAISING HELL, TOUGHER THAN LEATHER, the self-titled debut, or DOWN WITH THE KING and leave this sitting on the shelf."
1,Hmmm...,"Doesn't deserve to be in their catalogue. Even their uneven 1993 album could at least be considered a real effort, this seems like a sad attempt at crawling back into mainstream consciousness. They've lost their integrity and their style. Hope it's only temporary."
1,An insult to their earlier work.,These guys should have stopped while they were ahead. This is alot of rehashing of their old lyrics and beats. Very sad. Why did they bother?
4,Hip Hop Pioneers,"i cant believe all u haterz out there are slammin Run Dmc about how there last album is weak and hows theres too much rap-rock colabration.JUst becuz Fred durst,kid rock and everlast are on the album you people are dissin out runs last album,my opinion is that this is a dam good album and you people have no respect for Run Dmc and jus plain hate rock thats why this albuim is being slammed becuz you people dont like rock,dont get me wrong i love rap i live for rap but i also love rock so thats why i can understand this album and enjoy it...becuz im not ignorant"
2,Wheres DMC?,"Got an early release of this album. It really should be called DJ Run and his friends. I was very disappointed that DMC was really not on this album. I saw an interview recently that he was having some Voice problems and wouldn't participate in Crown Royal. If you saw the halftime show at the NFL AFC Title game you also would have noticed that DMC was not there. It would have made it a better album if he had joined in.Not much Classic Jam Master Jay. Too many looped tracks and not enough fresh scratchin'. Interesting take of Steve Millers Take the Money and Run. Title Track Rocks. Fred Durst, Kid Rock and Sugar Ray seem a bit out of place.The Jams are fresh and true to todays Hip-Hop. Guest artists give just enough flavor to blur the line that this is NOT Run DMC.I recommend it if your a fan of Run - but Wheres DMC?"
2,RAAAAAOWR with some rapping,"Coming to pay their dues to the duo and a DJ that gave rock rap, Stephan Jenkins, Mark McGrath, and Fred Durst step up to the plate and deliver some horrid crashing guitars and bad choruses to already tepid songs. Rather than make the songs sound like rapping over rock (see Shame by Wu-Tang and System of a Down off of Loud Rocks!) or rocking to a rap (Puff Daddy's rock remix of The Benjamins), you get a rapping over a mush of rock-like sounds (see also, Puff Daddy's rock remix of PE 2000). The only songs that shine are the collaborations with the Hip-Hop artists, most notably the Mef. It's a disappointment to Run DMC fans, to rap-rock fans, and to music fans in general."
1,Terrible album,This album sucked. I didn't like it at all and it should've never been released LOL. DMC was very upset with Run and Jam Master Jay for not asking for his permission to use his vocals on the album. DMC wasn't on the album that much anyway because his voice at the time was messed up.
2,Not bad but several major complaints,"This is a pretty good abbreviations dictionary, but after one month of use, the spine separated from the book and the whole thing fell apart. Furthermore, it is very poorly designed and almost impossible to read the type. So even if the information is good, what help is it if you cannot read it or keep it for longer than a month!"
3,Blade 2 soundtrack review,"Well to start off, I am a big hip-hop fan, as well as an electronica fan, so this collaborative album should be heaven on earth for me. I say first off that I agree with most reviews in the fact that the collaborative effort sounds too dissonant to work sonically. There are a few good songs on the album; the Mos Def/Massive Attack one is really good. I like both Cypress Hills and Volume 10's work with Roni Size. That child of the west song is so simple, yet so good. I also like the mystical/moby song. The rest of it is so/so.The main theme to the movie is no where as intense as the New Orders' Confusion from the 1st movie. I think that the movie needed a main theme that reflected the hard hitting intensity of the movie."
2,Blood is NOT Pumpin,"As it turns out, I was one of many looking for ""Blood is Pumpin"" (the track played in the club scene before the shoot out), and it's not on the sountrack. Why would they leave one of the best hard-house songs off of this CD?"
3,TECHNO SONG PLAYED IN CLUB,"The only songs I like on the whole CD where 1, 4, and 5. As for the CLUB SONG everyone is looking for it is ""Blood Is Pumpin"" by Voodoo & Serano. The version that is played in Blade 2 is the FUTURE MIX."
2,The missing track,"Like other reviewers I liked a lot of the music from the film. but having listened to samples of the album I couldn't find that one stunning track that was used in the film (night club or fight scene ?). So I didn't buy it :(Have since found the track though, it's called Clubbed to Death by Rob Duggan - Fantastic. :)"
3,Blade 2 Soundtrack,"Great movie, great sequel with heavier tunes. If you're looking for the club scene's ""Voodoo And Serano - Blood Is Pumping"", it's not on here."
2,Where is the best song???,"I can't stand it when there is a track that is played in a movie that is not on the soundtrack. If you anticipate this CD to contain the song that plays in the club scene during the movie, you will be as dissapointed as I am.The missing song is similar to ""Confusion"" by New Order that plays in the underground club scene during the first Blade flick.But - if you happen to know the missing song title, let me know!!"
1,Wish I could do less than 1 star for this one.,"Quoting Peter Downing: ""Tao of the Machine by BT and the Roots is a fantastic song."" I completely agree! Wish there were more out there like it, but I see more and more of the crap drowning out the better artists when they team up to get their names on the records and soundtracks as unfortunate as it is. >THIS< is why people choose to choose what songs they want *wink-wink's at the RIAA*"
3,Not as expected...,"If you like the hard stuff, you'll probably like this. I was looking for something more on the electronic side and not so metal, so I sold this CD after listening to it once. Just a warning if you liked Spawn but didn't like Resident Evil (musically) don't bother. Conversly, if you liked Resident Evil, this is for you."
3,The club Scene Song,"For God sake will everyone who says that the song in blade 2 is 'blood is pumpin' by voodoo & Serano go and crawl under a rock. FOR EVERYONES KNOWLEGDE THE SONG IS,, I REPEAT THE SONG IS Voodoo & serano meet Cj stone 'Cold Blood' Now everyone try to find it in their own way but for god sake it is not blood is pumpin"
1,a title,music great...rap bad. too bad there isn't an instrumental version of this album available. i'm glad i didn't pay for this cd.
2,Disappointing,"I found this CD very disappointing. I had some high expectations, and not one song lived up to them.By the way, the song you hear on the trailer and in the film, with the ""Calling All Freaks"" line, is not on the soundtrack. ..."
4,Excellent If you're a big fan of rap,"All in all, this is an excellent cd if you like rap! If not, you're definately out of luck, because that's all that's on here. Unfortunately the songs with Moby and Oakenfold really don't sound too good because the rap didn't mix to well with the synthesizers that Moby and Oakenfold both use. So, If you're a techno fan, then you may be dissapointed with Moby and Oakenfold's performances on this album. Subtract those two screw-ups, and you have a great album to listen to."
5,everything you wanted from the movie,"if you're a big fan of the movie and the tracks it played, this soundtrack covers all of that plus more!tough, hard beats fused with bone crunching lyrics, blade 2 is a perfect calabo with america's finest hip hop artists and (mostly) u.k.'s kings of trip hop/teck.cypress hill's ""child of the west"" with roni size is crazy! i've never heard anything like it. with cypress' unforgetable voice and roni size's tough speed beats, you get a massive hit like that.this is like the spawn soundtrack experiment, where spawn combined rock metal with tech.in alot of ways, this is the very same except for ine thing: this album was successful"
3,"What's the ""other"" club song?","Alright..this has been driving me crazy. Every review I read has 3 or 4 people talking about the ""Blood is Pumping"" track. Err..it's an awesome song and all, but I had it long before the movie came out, and nobody will mention the first ""club song"" they play that I'm looking for.The one that starts playing right when Blade and the blood pack enter the club.. Bleh, could someone help me out with the name of the song pls?"
3,song in the rave sceen,"Hi, form all u guys that wann know the song in the rave scene:The song is by Voodoo and Serano's nd it's calledBlood is Pumpin'If u wanna know more visit the website... and look for the forum type in sound and the answers will come.Enjoy"
2,"I respect rap and the talent of the artists, BUT...","I'm with Huntingtonsurfca...this would be much better without the rap. I admit it, ok? I'm biased. Rap is not my thing and techno is. But I buy a soundtrack to ""re-live"" the movie, and this one just does not do it for me. I looked forward to--and drooled at the thought of--that pounding techno we heard as Blade wiped up the floor with the bad guys. But that's nowhere to be found here. I also agree that the nightclub song would have made a nice addition. But as it stands, sorry, no sale. I'm saving my money for the movie score when it's released at a later date."
2,If you like CD's w/ about 4 decent songs on it....,"...then this is the CD for you. I was so hyped when i saw the magazine add, listing the collaborations from todays top electronic artists and the hottest rappers. To tell you the truth, this CD sounds like it was just slopped together. Some tracks are just rediculously messed around with, and the rapping does not even match the beat of track. The Eve/Fatboy slim and Mos Def/Massive attack song are just.....dont cut it. MY fav genres are techno and rap...and this CD explains what not to do when combining the 2. If you really want this CD, find someone to burn it for you, dont waste your money. Phat Tracks: 1,4,5,8. Hope the movie is better than the soundtrack."
1,Video killed the soundtrack stars...,"Yeah, rap/electronic sounds good in theory but so does having a live DJ at a circus freak show. Ya know, this cd absolutely [stinks]. The only good song on it was I Against I and the rest just sounded like [junk] some people wrote down names for and said ""just put something down, we'll use ProTools...don't worry about it."" I wouldn't recommend this to a person who's dying wish is to hear just one track from it. The movie just rocked the hizouse but this ruined the experience. Since there is going to be a Blade 3 either I suggest they use the rock/electronic style or just have no music at all. Don't buy this unless you're ready to expose your veins to the open air after you slice them open out of frustration."
5,Blade II -Soundtrack to my favorite movie of the trilogy,"Tweaking the formula of the earlier Spawn soundtrack album, which featured rock artists collaborating with electronic music artists, this soundtrack features rappers collaborating with electronic music artists. The songs, even the ones not used in the actual film, were a good fit to the darkness of the movie itself."
2,"Unless you're a rap fan, save your money","I really didn't care much for this album. The track listing sounds great and the idea of rap/electronica fusion is good, but the balance really goes in the direction of rap, which, I must admit, I'm not very fond of. I really like the Mos Def/Massive Attack collaboration on ""I Against I,"" but there are a lot of lyrical shortcomings on some of the other songs, most notably the collaboration between Eve/Fatboy Slim on ""Cowboy."" Unless you really like rap, you probably won't care too much for this album. I listened about 2/3 of the way through and then listed it for sale on half.com."
1,Total crap.,"I bought this thinking I would get some rock/alternative music. Instead, like the Blade soundtrack, I got a bunch of rap with swear word this and swear word that. This is total crap! Get the actual composition of this movie. You are just wasting money with this one!"
3,Such potential!,"This cd had so much potential: I have always been a big fan of the techno-oriented hiphop from Britain, but this just has some questionable collaborations (The Roots, the most organic, natural group out there right now, collaborating with BT?!?! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?). Some of the tracks meld styles brilliantly (Mystikal's bounce with the Moby's sheer beats; Mos Def on the darker Massive Attack beats; Redman's jovial flow with Gorillaz spring in his step) but it just doesn't work overall. Rip the songs off the 'Net instead"
3,Nothing wrong with it. But nothing special,"It doesn't fit my type of vent hood.The opening for the lint brush is the only thing that makes it better than a garbage bag.The one thing that is bothersome is that when you pull the lint brush out, you get the most lint out when power drill is still running. But since the bag doesn't fit, I have to duct tape it to the vent. And with the brush rotating, it spins out and pulls the bag off with it.Looks like a great product if it fits your vent."
1,Review of Gardus,"It was totally a waste of money. What I received was either incomplete, or it just didn't work. My son came and took the dryer apart and cleaned all of the venting. Now the dryer works like new."
4,Good but a few drawbacks,"I liked this product, especially if you are using it for just one dryer vent. And since there is nothing else like it that I know of, even with a few drawbacks, I would highly recommend it.But I will let you know what has gone wrong. I have used it on five dryer vents so far and the rods are starting to bend very easily and twist intead of spinning. You also have to make sure your drill is spinning to the right and not the left. If the drill switch gets moved accidentally (like what happened to us), the rods will unscrew in the vent and you will lose your parts!So other than having the brush stuck in a dryer vent, the product has worked great and is recommended."
5,Did the job!,"I had a completely plugged laundry chute, but this took care of it quickly. I tried using a standard snake for better than an hour before purchasing this system and an extension kit to clear our extra long exhaust. The snake wasn't able to clear an obvious plug about 15' from the access point. Because of the bristle end and the ability of using a cordless drill with this system, it was gone in ten minutes. Now I plan to use it once every six months to keep the line clear. The other parts are useful, but I didn't need them this time."
4,Excellent way to catch the lint,"Excellent way to catch the lint. it's not very easy to use the lint cleaner while you use the catcher bag. However, it beats trying to clean all lint from the floor and around plants. Did not give 5 stars since it's a pain to feed all the rods through."
2,Not worth it at least to me.,"I didn't have any results with this particular product. I won't say it won't work for you, but it didn't for me. It actually made my eyes puff up more the first few times I used it. And as far as lightening the dark circles...again no change. So it means I have to stick to the camo under eye make-up which I would really like to get away from.Also, I HATE the way this product comes out of the bottle. There must be a better way."
4,Skin Medica TNS,My dermatologist recommended this product for my dark circles under my eyes and fine lines. I had a $30 savings purchasing this item through Amazon rather than in the dermatologistSkinMedica TNS Illuminating Eye Cream 0.5 oz.office.
2,Live & Learn,"Ok so I saved a lot of money purchasing this here instead of clinic...1 star for that. The second star is only because I think I am still trying to give it the benefit of doubt that eventually, soon, any day now, I will notice a difference in eye area by using this cream. Not yet though. Still waiting for some results. But I think I will just stick to Botox.....its worth the money!"
1,Lost Money,"This is by far one of the worst pieces of drivel that I have ever read. First of all, Ms. Robsinson is obviously lacking a concept of a proper English sentence. If her publishers had actually read the manuscript, perhaps they would have picked up the numerous structural and grammatical errors that pepper Ms. Robinson's writing. Secondly, the plot makes no sense. Thirdly, it's just not interesting. I highly doubt we will be seeing parts II and III of this trilogy, because any publisher would have to be stupid to keep publishing this junk."
4,Remastered Warmth,"This 2004 remastering of the original recordings brings a pristine presence and freshness to these favorites. Bing's rendition of ""Let it Snow,"" for instance, looses the crude, ""sproingy"" sounding reverb that has been applied to it by various sound engineers over the years. Instead, you hear Bing himself with a very natural sounding voice, as if he were standing in your living room, and not in a cave."
5,Gives me goosebumps!,"This is the album that starts the season right! Reminds of compilations I used to listen to when I used to work a second job in retail during the holiday seasons when I was in my 20s just a few years ago. It's a harried and stressful season, but with songs like these, you can't help but look forward to the end of the year..."
1,Blame Someone Else,"This poorly made film can be summarized in the following sentence:Let's blame everything on the Clinton Administration.That's the plot of this film. It is not a critical, logical breakdown of Moore's film (as I expected) but rather a bunch of pointing fingers all in the direction of Bill Clinton.Don't waste your money. Download it from the internet if you really want to see it."
1,"Trash in, Crasp Trash out!","What a waste of time, effort and resources. If you haven't anything better to do your time and money (even $.02 cents) then donate it to something more worthy,... But I suggest there are probably better selections of movies (documentary, history, etc,) or books in the cheatest clearence section to spend/ invest..."
1,...republican-colored glasses...,"let's face it...the house of cards that this administration built on lies and fears, is finally seeing it's apex, like icarus flying too close to the sun, with the indictment of tom delay, and the investigations on pratically every other republican, in, or near, the white house, including bill frist, dick cheney, karl rove, and even bill bennett...and just as nixon had his watergate, so too shall bush have his day in court, literally, when all the allegations in michael moore's film come to light, in a nation that has finally taken off their republican-colored glasses, and realizes that one good horndog in the white house, is still better than one hundred iran-contras..."
1,Um hm I mean um B B Bush um um um P P Pro p paganda.,"Simply bush propaganda. Pay attention by the way on how many times there are jittery or stuttering people in this movie. Especially the electric engineer without arms. I think a schizophrenic could give a better interview. Some of the people are blinking almost like windshield wipers during a rainstorm. I think this movie has more ""um"" words than bush has lies."
1,CRAP,A testament to Moore's filmmaking and feeble arguments that avoid the issues. What a waste of time.
4,The real story,FahrenHYPE 9/11 is one of the many moviesinspired by the film Fahrenheit 9/11. Itpoints out inaccuracies of Fahrenheit 9/11and how some information was manipulated.
2,Unconvincing propaganda,"What to say about this film but that the intentions were clear, unambiguous, and that's the problem. At least Michael Moore brings some evidence to his arguments. Here Fahrenhype brings opinions supported by... other opinions... It is disorganized propaganda at best, unconvincing because they do not support their arguments with facts. Pressed about the lack of WMD in Iraq, former Mayor Ed Koch claims that he would have supported the war even if he had known that there was no WMD, but why is not clear. Because Sadam Hussein was a bad boy? In which case we should be waging war in 30 countries just now! The most compelling arguments in this movie are from individuals who were portrayed in a light contrary to their wishes in Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. Granted. But for the rest, even the Pet Goat episode, it does remain unconvincing. Talking heads do not make up for missing facts (or missing WMDs)."
4,Moore Cronies Get Real!,"I love the reviewers that say things like ""boring"" and ""backed up with no facts"" yet nothing else. What are they talking about?This movie counters the points in Farenheit 9/11 and is full of ""facts"". Just read the other reviewers' points of view. Even those reviewers who disagree with the points in the movie have some counterpoints to the ""facts"" discussed in the movie. Come on!Next time watch the movie before you review it!"
1,"Read ""Scarecrow"" Before You Watch This ""Hype""","If you have a shade of objectivity left, before you waste your money on this trashy, lying DVD, read Bill Jabanoski's ""Scarecrow."" Read the words of someone who both reported from New York City in the aftermath of 9/11 and had the guts to go to war as a front line reporter with our troops in Iraq while you and me were sitting in our safe suburban homes. It might just change your mind a little."
3,Worth Watching,"I strongly suggest watching this for the sake of balance with Fahrenheit 9/11. It is much drier than Moore's film, but it presents the other side. It is difficult to disentangle truth from fiction in both movies, but watching only one or the other definitely gives a biased and misleading picture. Watching only this movie, however, can be quite confusing, as the entire thing is built as a response to Moore's film."
2,"Decent, but missed many points","This movie was a decent response to Fahrenheit 9/11, but only decent. It mostly talked about the film techniques Moore used, such as changing the relative size of newspaper headlines and showing parts of interviews (and as I have studied documentaries a lot, it is a simple truth that both sides of the aisle use these techniques. all documentaries are biased in some way). They don't really go after his argument at all, which would have been the only common-sense thing to do. Plus, the quality of the film itself is poor, as it is mostly talking heads and not much else."
2,Meh.,"I just saw this movie, which I received as a gift. It was a decent attempt at countering the claims made by Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11. Unfortunately, many arguments were presented using the same tactics Moore is attacked for using; juxtaposition, stating facts without source, etc. In fact, at times I did not know what was being argued because the scene was busy interviewing a grieving mother or soldier (appeal to emotion). This movie is basically the same movie as Fahrenheit without the big budget and expressing polar opposite views. A good watch for viewers interested in politics and/or modern propaganda."
1,I see this is selling for $1.68 Used (that's too much),I want the time in my life that Michal Moore took from me. Truth about Terrorism - This film isn't truth about anything.
1,save your $,what a waste of 2 hours. I could make a better bash movie of Michael Moore. save your $.
1,A worthless rebuttal documentary,"This could be the worst movie I've ever seen. It's sloppily edited, poorly done, and it is chock full of LIES. Michael Moore is a genius and the people responsible for making this DVD should be penalizaed for belittling Mr. Moore and his work. Those who buy this DVD are evil satanic right wingers who must be STOPPED!"
5,Journey to the Ottoman Empire and 18th century England,"I first read the letters from the embassy to Turkey in a course on Restoration & 18th century women authors; I loved the text, and I knew I would have to find a complete copy of her collected letters. To read Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's letters is to become closely acquainted with an intelligent, cultured, inquisitive and opinionated woman whose social circle included Alexander Pope and other worthies. Her insights into the wholly separate women's culture of the Ottoman Empire is fascinating, exposing a world unavailable to any male travelers to Turkey. As a narrator she is wonderfully descriptive without losing a shred of personality -- a personality which remains vivid across two and a half centuries."
3,Great light source; ignition a pain.,"This lantern is the only light source needed to light our entire single-family campsite at night. Love the hard carry case and easy, cheap propane fuel source. However, the ""InstaStart"" feature is anything but. It takes several clicks and attempts to light. We've got it to light every time; but with a scary, loud POOF as the propane accumulates during the ignition delay."
1,Still trying to figure out how it works,"This lantern was not easy to assemble and we cindged the inside mantles the first time we used it. We purchased extra and cinged those as well. We may have done something wrong but I have yet to find out what that was. Needless to say, we went on our camping trip and I never used the lantern; luckily that wasn't the only one we took. So if you decide to purchase this lantern try it before you leave home and take an extra lantern, preferably battery operated."
4,I novice,I'm a complete novice when it comes to camping but I found this lantern to be very easy to use. It seems sturdy enough but I have no scale to judge it on. The insta light worked very well for me. It only took a maximum of 5 presses and the lantern was lighting up the entire camp site. There is a hissing noise but I figure that is normal because it is a gas lantern. I get annoyed very easily and I didn't notice the noise after a couple of minutes. Plus the carry case is awesome. I'm satisfied.
1,Poor quality and very dangerous,"Based on the other ""glowing"" reviews of this product, maybe I got a bad one. Three major problems:- The Instastart ignition works only about 1 in 20 times. By the time it decides to work, the globe is full of propane, and the lantern explodes when it ignites.- The lantern makes an *extremely* loud humming noise when on low, like a musical instrument. When turned up, the humming stops, and the (expected) hissing sound can be heard.- The knob to control the propane flow is far too flimsy and loose for a product that uses an inflammable substance. It spins around freely like a roulette wheel. This is a serious design flaw.The way I received it, this product is *extremely dangerous*. I expect more from Coleman. I returned for a refund.YMMV."
4,First NorthStar lantern I've owned,"First, I like the NorthStar type lantern better than the old style bowl mantles. There is a larger surface area to burn and hence more light. This lantern works great and the self ignitor worked through a weekend camping trip without a hiccup. The only reason I only gave 4 stars vs. 5 is that the mantle seems like it is burning through faster than I would have liked after only a weekend worth of use. It's not ready to be replaced yet but the holes I'm seeing are more than I would have thought. Maybe this is a trade-off for the better lighting."
1,Not worth the headache!!,"I purchased this lantern and promptly returned it. The ""instastart"" never started it and the mantle failed immediately. I would stick with the lantern type that has a hanging mantle rather than one that connects at top and bottom. Poor design in my opinion."
2,Coleman northstar lantern,I am not very happy with this product! For suposedly being one of Colemans better lanterns the quality is poor. The top cover was marred badly and rusty. Instant start is a joke. I have to push the button 5-10 times to get it to light and I am leary of it as I am afraid an accumulation of propane could explode. Inserting a match doesn't work well either. I would not recommend this product to anyone and I am considering returning.
1,Are you kidding me?,"This is the worst of all the Luke Shows. I thought freak show # 1 was wack. ( because of all the censorship. ) But this is just lame, it's like an interview with a couple of strippers in the background. Get your butt back on the road Luke! We don't respect you for your interview skills, now get them Luke girls to shake it up!"
1,"Corrupt, inaccurate and deceptive","I wonder how many of the reviewers are members od the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society (Jehovah's Witnesses)?Pretty much all scholars around the world consider the NWT as dishonest, corrupt, lacking in any scholarly substance and biased. If anyone wishes to know more, contact me on rogmaministries@tiscali.co.uk. The 'translators' (I use that term in the loosest of senses) ignore rules of Greek grammar, leave words out, insert words to change meaanings and make a whole mockery of the Bible. This is NOT a Godly work.Unfortunately, the least I could give this was one star; there are no minus stars!"
5,Life of Heber C. Kimball,I enjoy reading the life history of some the early leaders to the mormon church and see how they suceeded in their lives. They may have had trials but had a success to get around them. Enjoying history of how they did.
3,small but cute,"puppy plays with it frome time to time , but definitely not one of her favorite toys thought it would be bigger"
1,"Adorable toy, but lasted 15 minutes:(","Adorable toy, but lasted 15 minutes:(This santa loofa was very cute to look at, but my Shih tzu destroyed it in about 15 minutes, first ripping the santa hat right off it and almost choked on it. From there she ripped the whole thing apart and I found her chewing on the plastic squeek toy inside. I'm glad I came in to check on her, she could have easily choked on the hat, foam inside, and the squeeker."
4,Lost In Space,"Well I have been awaiting for this Fig Naytion album to drop since I heard him on If These Walls Could Talk...And I'm pretty pleased with his solo effort...Most of the beats are produced by Siccmade so if your into that Siccmade Muzicc sound you'll prolly feel this to the fullest...Plus Fig Nay's got a a flow like none other...The best traks are ""Lost In Space"",""If There's A Will""(Feat.Phonk Beta) and ""Hungrey Man's Syndrome""(Feat The Swartzaniggaz)"
2,Hawkwind - 'Zones' (Griffin),"Originally put out in 1983. Not by far the best lp from the long running British space rock ensemble. Notice that Nik Turner had returned on this record, although I believe he was only on a couple of tracks. Even though the production is good, 'Zones' simply just doesn't make the grade. As for the tunes, I thought ""Running Through The Back Brain"", ""Utopia 84"" and the remake of ""Sonic Attack"" were the only cuts that make this CD even worth keeping. The remake of ""Brainstorm"" is bloody awful. Nice cover anyway. Most definitely - my least preferred Hawkwind lp ever. In fact, I believe it's the only title in their vast catalog that I do not like."
1,received package torn and book damaged,"I have always found you to be dependable and rapid in processing my orders. This problem may have not particularly been your fault, however,the post office labled the torn package ""Received Damaged."" The package looked like it had automobile tire tracks on it. The book was torn as well. The reason I did not do anything about it was that it was ia used book and didn't cost much. It was going to be a gift which of course I did not give. Since you asked for a review, I felt you really wanted to know."
1,Does not live up to expectations,"Colson has a good theme for this book but has so much unnecessary information that the reading is tedious. This is the ""updated"" version .... too bad it didn't get better editorial work. It had potential."
2,DUBBED VS ORIGINAL!,"I am a HUGE fan of sailor moon, (been one sinse I was little) and I must agree with everyone else. I will give DIC credit for releasing these but your better off getting the orginal uncut ones for yourself.Dic when will you learn?"
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I admit that I am probably one of Sailor Moon's biggest fans, but this series of DVD's isn't worth bothering with unless you're suffering from some sort of compulsive disorder! Unlike the ""Sailor Moon S"" and ""Sailor Moon SuperS"" collections, released uncut, in order, and available in both English and Japanese, this collection from the first and second season is a huge disappointment. Episodes are edited, only available in English, and of a much lower quality than the other two (released by a different distributor.) Unless you simply cannot live without the first and second season (and, I know, its hard to say no,) save your money and hope that the distributors of this series will see the light and re-release these seasons in an improved format."
3,it is OK,It is a great idea...But for a squirmy kid I don't feel that it is too secure. It is easy to attach and remove. It is skid resistant and easy to clean. The booster works like a beanbag chair. If the child leans too far to the left or right it is difficult for the child to sit back up.
1,I didn't realize a Holmes movie could be this bad,"Where to begin with the flaws in this horrible production? I'll start with a gratuitous scene in which Holmes takes cocaine while cogitating on a case - a nauseating scene which completely violates the Holmes canon. Holmes never used cocaine while working on a case (he only resorted to it from boredom), and the original Baskervilles story does not contain the word ""cocaine"" anywhere in it (check Project Gutenberg's electronic text files). The scene was utterly unnecessary and jarring.The snide, sneering Holmes portrayal completely misses the mark. Holmes could be contemptuous, it's true, but he could also be a genuine gentleman, which this characterization completely overlooks.I can't go on.... I don't want to think about this travesty any longer. If you liked the book, get the Granada version with Jeremy Brett instead of this ...."
3,A great BBC dramatisation,I had no pre-conceptions and i am not a Sherlock Holmes fan. I watched the film simply to enjoy it. And that i did. The setting was picturesque and this was a period drama with a little more than corsets. The acting was good and I throughly enjoyed the air of suspense created. A good film to watch one late saturday night.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I gave this one star not because it was bad, but because it was not viewable. It states that it is a region 1 DVD, but it will not play on a region 1 DVD player. I cannot get Amazon to check this out for me. They even sent me another one and it still won't play. Someone wrote a review previously which is no longer on this site stating the same thing. I believe that this DVD needs to be played on a code free DVD player. When I get one, I will watch it and review it again."
2,DVD did not work on DVD player,The only way we could watch the DVD was to use our computer. It would not run on our DVD player.
4,well acted but not true to canon,"This was an extremely good and thought provoking version of what I've always believed is by far the best Holmes story. The acting in this was extremely good, easily five star, particularly the characterization of Stapleton(who was played as bumbling in some of the other versions, to much less impact). Also, this really captured the brooding environs of the moor. However, the one thing I really didn't like here was the portrayal of Watson as almost antagonistic to Holmes. At one point he practically screams at Holmes to let go of him. While Doyle's Watson was definitely not the incompetent portrayed by Nigel Bruce, he would NEVER be antagonistic(to that degree) to Holmes, and that makes this, overall, four instead of 5 stars."
2,I'm sorry I watched it,"This is an unsatifying version of Hound. First, Richard Roxburgh is a fine actor but he's no Sherlock Holmes. His version of the great detective is a cold man who doesn't really care about Sir Henry at all. He's only in it for the thrill of the chase and almost gets the baronet killed. Watson's portrayal wasn't bad. The ""real"" Dr. Watson of the books was no fool but the chemistry between the actors just wasn't there. The Watson of this movie found Holmes to be a maddening companion.The villain was quite good but the hound was a terrible mistake. They should've used a real animal. This computer animated creature looked like it cost five dollars to create it.Bottom line: rent this movie or catch on PBS. Don't waste your money buying it."
4,A Great Movie!,"The Hound of the Baskervilles is a great movie. I first watched this back in 2007 in English class as we had just got done reading the Hound of the Baskervilles. My teacher was only able to get this copy. I must say, at first I thought the movie looked dull and boring. I knew of Richard Roxburgh from his movie Van Helsing, was excited to see him play Holmes. He's really good, but not my first choice for a Holmes. Ian hart who plays Watson, is excellent. He was an amazing choice. This movie however, is not that true to the book, and things were changed, but it was still a good movie, and a must-have for any Sherlock Holmes/Richard Roxburgh fans. I watched this movie again last night, and found it much more enjoyable after watching it for 2nd time."
1,Terrible,Fortunately I saw this on PBS before buying the DVD. I would only consider this DVD if you are NOT a Holmes fan. It is such a departure from the book that really only the hound makes it recognizable. Gone is the opening deductions about the walking stick...Dr Mortimer now has a wife who holds a seance to talk to the dead Sir Charles...gone is the telegram to Barrymore. Mr Franklin is gone and Laura Lyons (which leaves unexplained why Sir Charles was in the Yew Alley that night). Added are fight scenes between Holmes and the cabby as well as one with Selden. This production clearly takes great liberties in its quest to put some sensation and action into the story. For me it is too great a departure. I'll wait for the Brett DVD due out later this month.
1,Vile Baskerhound Tosh,"Yes - very difficult to revisit such a well-known story - but best advised not to try.Why?Roxburgh - plank. Hart - juvenile with weird head and lounge lizard tash.Here in the UK the supporting cast are all better known than the leads - thus, you don't know who you're supposed to be watching. Much ""Oh look, it's whats'ername..."" slows matters to a crawl.Excisions and additions - exiguous. Depiction of cocaine usage in toilet stall - presumably derived from hilarity-filled production lunches?Dialogue not bad; moorland photogenically wet, much like entire production.Avoid."
3,well done,"This version of the Hound is very well done. Matt Frewer was the best Holmes of recent years, but Richard Roxburgh gives a fine performance and Ian Hart is good as Watson. Lots of atmosphere and some re-toolong make this an interesting take on the oft told tale."
1,FYI,"DO NOT buy this DVD, ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" from Amazon.com, it is not a Region 1 -- I don't appreciate paying for a DVD then finding out that it is not Region 1 and therefore will not play on a North American DVD player. If a website wishes to sell Region 2 DVD's it should be honest and state the truth."
1,The Wrong Version,"This is a wonderful story and production...originally. However, the BBC Video (company) version I purchased which is 100 minutes in length had been edited so much that there were entire scenes missing right from the begining! I know because I taped the original when it aired on Masterpiece Theatre.Buyer beware: This is not the full length version of the otherwise excellent program."
3,Missed Opportunity,"One wonders what the producers were thinking when they had the perfect actor to play Sherlock Holmes--and instead cast him as the villain! Richard Grant has the look, the style, and the energy of Conan Doyle's iconic character, and it's his dynamic performance that makes this movie worth watching. When he's on the screen, the movie comes alive; when he's not, the movie is tedious and predictable. By not casting Grant as Holmes, the producers missed a golden opportunity to launch an entire new series of Sherlock Holmes stories. Too bad."
3,Strays from the original story,"This review is based on the TV presentation on the BBC in Great Britain. The acting and general production are very good, but this film does not stick to the original story. Some elements have been missed out, and others have been changed quite radically. If you have never read the book then this probably won't wory you, but if you are familiar with the story then you may find these changes not to your liking.There are also some errors with regard to the railway scenes, but I'll reveal myself to be a complete 'anorak' if I detail those, so I'll leave it as a general warning!"
1,Unfaithful and miscast version.,"This is quite the worst ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" I have seen. It is nothing new to deviate from the Conan-Doyle story and although this doesn't do so often, it does it in pointless and unnecessary ways. The worst feature, however, is the miscasting of Holmes, who is so wooden he hardly registers at all, and Watson who is completely alien to Conan-Doyle's creation and dominates throughout as if he was the main character.If this is an attempt to de-construct the Holmes story you can keep it."
2,A Waste of the Baskervilles,"That Roxburgh is unsuited to portray Holmes is uncomfortably obvious. He adds none of Holmes's charming eccentricities, struggles to voice the part, and hardly looks it either, especially when next to Grant, who himself would've been better at it. Hart and Nettles are physically unsuited for their roles as well. Add to a poorly cast lot a script that goes too far afield from the novel. Holmes's use of cocaine is overstated here, and his relationship with Watson is made to be one of the barest tolerance, rather than the one of enduring friendship and admiration Doyle created. The scenes that didn't appear in the novel at all border on silliness, contributing nothing. I can't see this film being of any value to an avid Sherlockian. Grant's performance is its only commendable feature, earning it two stars instead of one."
3,Good on you BBC,"""Hounds"" captured the mood of the period, the strong dominant male attitude of the day, with an accent on more than just the Holmes character.John Nettles (Midsomer Murders, Inspector Barnaby) as Dr. Mortimer brought depth to the film as an intelligent man of science, caring, intense, troubled and persistent in his quest for answers.Thanks to all for your production efforts. Worth the remake."
1,Awful,"I got this after watching the movie, which contained some beautiful songs. Not one of the songs on this CD was even complete; I couldn't even recognize the songs that I'd loved in the movie. The sound was awful, the case was badly cracked, and I think the seller stole it from a library. Total waste of money."
5,Buy this one and Gilels' too,"This concerto is simply the greatest work of its genre, so there is room for more than one way to interpret it. Serkin and Szell serve this Brahms flambé, with a pedal-to-the-metal reading that maximizes the impact and power of the work as no other performance does. No, they don't match the Gilels/Jochum CD's nuance and poetry. Nobody does. But in the second movement, even Gilels--in fact, even the more sprightly Gilels/Reiner performance--sounds like ""allegro milktoast"" compared to this one.For almost everyone interested in Brahms, this recording is a ""must."" Serious collectors will prize its distinctiveness and vitality; newcomers will find no better introduction to Brahms than a performance that is as far from boring as great playing gets. Audiophiles, however, will disdain the Columbia sound, which even in the 1960s might have been clearer and cleaner."
3,"Good book, but so many typos and grammatical errors","I enjoyed this book immensely. It describes the wanton and horrific drinking habits of twelve of the most gifted writers/poets of the 20th century with a brutally comic eye for all the sordid details. Especially awful are the behaviors of truly childish and abjectly self-obsessed, abusive thugs such as John Berryman, Robert Lowell and Malcolm Lowry, as are the twisted antics of Anne Sexton who, for all her talent, was at heart a shameless courtesan with more mental illnesses than you could shake a stick at.However, for all this book's skill and deft reporting, I was completely baffled by the sheer number of typos, missing words and errors in grammar and usage that appear on almost every page. Many mistakes appear as though the book was edited by someone whose first language is not English. I was disappointed that such a well-written book *about literature* was diminished by the sloppy proofreading and editing."
4,"Elegant tea: wonderful aroma, a light ""green"" tea taste, not much pear taste, though","I bought my box of this tea on the ground, not Amazon. I know sometimes the sub and save products can be near expiration or be stale. I've had that issue sometimes. So, cannot speak to the sub/save version's quality.The tea itself is lovely. The white tea tastes like a lighter version of green tea, and the pear taste is super subtle. But the aroma--wow, that's just such a pleasure. Sniffing is a big part of the pleasure of this gentle tea. This is great for folks who want the pleasurable experience of teabags--they are beautiful, pyramidal mesh bags, no string, but feel ""high class""--rather than using loose leaves.If you hate strong tasting or overly complex tea flavor combos, this is a great one to try. Easy in the mouth, wonderful in the nose, and with the antioxidants we all want from green/white tea.Enjoy..."
2,No pear taste..,"I have bought several Revolution flavored teas.. white pomegranate and sweet ginger peach (not sweet but nice peachy ginger taste) and I loved them. However, this tea is not too good.. there is no pear flavor! not even a subtle one.. it is a bit bitter and really just like a plain white tea. If you like that, fine, but don't expect a pear taste!"
3,Pear???,This is a pleasant enough White Tea but I don't taste Pear at all! Which of course is disappointing considering I bought a flavored White Tea and not a plain one. Won't buy again. Prefer the CS Perfectly Pear instead.
4,English dubbing! >_<,"This cd is sublime. i grew up in Japan + this music reminds me of home. :) But WHY did they dub over the main theme?!? They kept the Tatara work song in the original Japanese! So unfortunately i have to give this cd four stars. If you get a chance, listen to the original Japanese theme song. It blows this version way out of the water."
4,Great! But incomplete.,"I enjoyed the soundtrack as much, if not more, than the other reviewers, but I was disappointed that this release did not include the original Japanese version of the Princess Mononoke theme performed by Yoshikazu Mera. Hardcore fans may want to seek an import instead."
5,"Beautifully done, and it *is* Hisaishi's best","I've watched nearly every Ghibli movie that exists, and I have to say, none of the soundtracks come even close to this one. I literally almost cried at the end of this movie (very unlike me), and the soundtrack made the movie that much more emotional. Even if you've never watched the movie, this soundtrack is worth buying."
5,A truely breathtaking score!,Princess Mononoke is an amazing film that just is wonderous everytime you see it. It may be animated but it is one of the best films I have seen. The score is no less amazing. It takes inside the legend and grandure of the film. It moves with its simple melodies and dramatic undertones. The score Creates the world of Gods and demons. It makes you feel the love the two main characters share. The mononoke-hime is a wonderful song that the director wrote. this score is magificent in everyway it deseves an oscar nomination as does the movie itself. this score takes you to the anicent days when animals were gods and heroes lived.
3,pretty good Cd,got a chance to hear this Disc recently after watching the film& enjoyed the arrangements&tempos throughout. a pretty good disc. catchy&good use of instrumentation.
5,Beautiful and Haunting,"From the moment I finished the movie, I knew I wanted the soundtrack. The haunting tunes and smooth melodies are not only good with the movie, but on their own. Each song has it's own theme, and rarely is a melody used more than once. Joe Hisaishi, the composer of the CD, has taken the visual beauty of Princess Mononoke and turned it into a powerful music score. His uses wind instruments like flutes and string instruments such as violins to create the flowing experience that follows through the entire soundtrack. One song that leaves this flowing theme is that of the `Battle Drums.' Instead of the wind and strings, Hisaishi moves to the powerful drums of Kodo. I have been to a Kodo performance, and Hisaishi takes the long Japanese tradition and shifts it perfectly to fit in with both the movie and the soundtrack. All I can say is that this soundtrack is worth it; it is not necessary to see the movie to enjoy Hisaishi's masterpiece."
5,Joe Hisaishi Is A Genius,"The movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The animation was incredible and the story was enthralling. And the accompanying score is one of the best ever. Although, the tracks are cut short a lot (a surprising amount of them are 30 seconds to a minute), it's still worth listening to them. Joe Hisaishi creates wonderful themes and melodies and never misses a beat. My only complaint is the Mononoke theme. It's cut horribly to 80 seconds from the original 4 minutes+. If you can, download Napster, and then download the MP3 of the theme. It's so much better in it's full version."
5,beautiful...,"A seamless blend of western orchestral monumentality and grandeur with traditional oriental melodies that are full of mysticism, poetry and inspiration. Especially recommended to lovers of classical music. Hisaishi writes the kind of music that has what you would call a nationalistic character in it -- passionate and full of fervor, dreamy and melancholic, and imbued with deep humanity and a strong oriental identity. If you liked Tchaikovsky, Dvorak or Sibelius, you would find Hisaishi's music a very worthwhile and enjoyable experience. Personally I find myself playing this album from beginning to end and return to it from time to time.Hisaishi made arrangements of these pieces into an orchestral suites, played by Czech Philharmonic Orchestra with an Eastern European taste. The composer played the piano solo in some movements. The music is warm, lush, and melodic, just as this one here."
5,One of the great music,"The movie Mononoke Hime is very great, and so does its soundtrack CD. The music is tuneful to me and I believe to the hilt that this CD is peerless. You can't imagine how great it is, the only solution is to experience it with your ears. Everytime I listen to the music as if I see Asutaka and San... To buy this CD is a must, but don't buy a pirated one."
5,Exquisite and Beautiful,"Sugoi! I love this CD. So enchanting and hauntingly beautiful. This was just as a good as the original japanese sounddtrack. The english version of the vocal theme of Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime) was wonderful. The vocalist did an excellent job on matching the english lyrics and sound and made it sound just like the original. My only complain (that song was a bit small) The original was longer, but the english version was superior! This soundtrack in complete is very relaxing. I can listen to it while driving at rush hour and *not* get frustrated ^_^ I completely recommend this CD. Worth every penny. If you ever wanted to own the original and thought a japanese import cost too much, BUY THIS. It's the same and complete as the japanese version. Even the song ""Tatara Women Work Song"" is in japanese...that song alone gives me goosebumps, it's so beautiful. The women's vocals are so...wonderful. BUY THIS, it should not be missed and you WON'T regret it!"
5,Beautiful,"The music from this film was great. For one who has seen the film (multiple times), it evokes memories from this movie, and this is a movie that is not to be forgotten."
5,Beautiful!,"This cd is very very good. Hisaishi composed the music very well and puts a lot of emotion into his music. All of my friends and family say this is a great cd and i agree! There are a few songs I don't really like but besides that, all of the songs are great. The music and songs are all just beautiful and well composed.This cd has never left my computer since the day I bought it. I recommend this cd to anyone who loves beautiful music and enjoys listening to it."
2,watch out,"Originally I was extremely pleased with this camera, the picture quality, the speedy times, the software, everything. After owning it about 5 months though, the camera would become moody as to when it would turn on, every once in awhile it would decide not to turn on. At first i thought it was a battery problem, so i bought several different packs of rechargable batteries, as well as a slew of lithium ones. The problem was annoying at first, but after awhile it came to the point where it would no longer turn on.Frustrated, i exchanged the camera for a new one. Yet again, after only a month of use, the same problem occurred. I called customer service and sent it in for a repair, but upon return, the problem hadn't been fixed.A friend of mine has the exact same camera and has the exact same problem.Watch out, their customer service is nearly useless and there may be a problem with this model."
5,Great Camera,"This is an excellent camera, the quality of the pictures are crystal clear, the video recordings sound quality is excellent it picks up everything, even when its a noisy atmosphere, not to mention the video record quality is pretty good. This is my second Kodak camera and I like this one far better, at first I had the 3.0 MP camera, but I returned it for this one, and I'm happy that I made that decision. May I also recommend that you download the new Kodak Easyshare software from the Kodak site, its a newer version 5.0 I believe its a little bit better than the software that it comes with. You're able to add music to your videos, and its easier to use."
5,This Camera is AWESOME,"I purchased this camera along with the printer dock and it is awesome. It produces BETTER pictures than a very expensive 35mm camera professionally developed. It's a MUST HAVE. It's so simple to use, a child could use it and get perfect pictures. I cannot tell you how much I LOVE IT !"
1,Beauty and then the Beast,"I liked this camera a lot. I thought it took nice pictures and was very user friendly....however....after about 6 months of owning the camera it started to have problems. Although I took excellent care of the camera it got a mind of its own. It turns on and off at random times, and uses two AA batteries in about 3 minutes. It uses batteries so fast that I am forced not to use the camera anymore. Is this a manufacturing flaw?"
3,Very impressive point and shoot digitial camera,This is my second point and shoot digital camera. Nothing was wrong with my other it just took a rocket scientist to use it. Not with the Kodak CX7530. You can basically turn it on and figure all the buttons easily. I love the screen descriptions when you turn the top dial to see what mode you are in. Daytime shots come out great! Night time are not so great as the flash doesn't carry but that is the case with most digital cameras. I would buy this camera again in an instant! Update. I've had this camera for over 2 years and am now having trouble with it not turning on all the time. If I remove and put the batteries back in it usually fixes the problem. I'm also having trouble with the flash...
3,OK camera,"The pictures it takes are fine; my main complaints are that this camera has a slow shutter speed, it takes a long time to reset itself when I'm trying to shoot a number of pictures at once AND this camera uses up a lot of battery power (especially when transferring over photos). I wish it came with a rechargeable battery instead of requiring AA batteries."
5,5 Stars is not enough,"I'm not new to photography or digital cameras. I've had them for a few years now. This CX7530 is a fabulous camera. You can just point and shoot or you can go into the menus and adjust the shutter speed and ISO and get some really creative shots. I took mine to the Shedd Aquarium at night and put it on a tripod to capture the city (Chicago) from the lake. I adjusted the shutter for a long exposure on 5 MP setting. The resulting picture was breath taking. We've had it professionally printed and it is now a wall mural. It is that good. Really sharp pictures even when laid down on very large paper stock.You can not go wrong with this camera, and I highly recommend the printer dock. Once you get the camera and printer dock you will never go back to film.I've had the camera for about 9 months."
3,Low price for a reason,"If you have a limited budget this is a good camera, the batteries run out fast and if you don't mind pressing the shutter button and the picture finally snaps which seems like 2 seconds later-this is for you. I thought this lag time wouldn't be a big deal until I used it, it became a huge annoyance and a big drawback for enjoying using this camera."
3,Not bad,"I bought this for my sister. She said it was too soft, so she had to hold the baby to keep her from rolling off. However, it kept her from straining to keep the baby up."
2,Slippery.,"This product is so close to being awesome. I'm tall, 6'1 and thought this was going to be a godsend for nuring. I tried using it several times but its slippery and not comfortable. It doesn't BOOST enough and the baby it awkward laying on it."
3,Material is scruffy,"Our baby has not arrived yet so I can not comment on usage. However, I did want to warn others that the material is very scruffy and stuffing does start coming out as another reviewer mention. We haven't even used it and stuffing is already stuck in the Velcro.Item does fit around my waist just fine and I am 7months pregnant so it will fit larger women."
2,"Too soft, hard to position.","I love the shape and height of this pillow, but it's just too soft for nursing. The lack of support causes the baby to ""slip"" forward. It's a very light-weight pillow and tends to shift a lot on your lap. Also, the cheap filling tends to bunch up and become misshapen after only a few washes."
4,husband and baby love it!,"this is soft but is compact enough to hold baby, unlike other pillows where baby will sink into it or it will lose shape after a while. been using for almost 4 months and its my husband's favorite, he uses it putting baby to sleep, letting her drink or when playing with her/when she sitting up. 4 stars only because the extra little pillow the 'adjustable booster' wasnt able to use that one as baby would be too high already if i used that. but definitely i recommend this!"
4,Excellent Choice!,"Great nursing pillow...in my case, it's the best thing for men because you really can get tired when you feed your child with the bottle so this pillow would be something unique to rest on. For my wife is an ok product, not excellent because the pillow is a little bit higher than her breast so when she tries to breast feeding our daughter it gets uncomfortable and difficult to work with."
1,Hated it!,"The pillow looks good until you try it! Too soft, baby practically roll soff. I returned it immediately."
4,Worth the Modest Cost,"PC Attorney is a good basic source for a wide array of legal documents, including a simple will, power of attorney, living will, bill of sale, and promissory note.PC AttorneyIt is without doubt worth the modest price, and it uses comparatively little space on your computer. If you decide to buy this product, be sure you get a version that will work on your operating system."
2,Worthless software,"This software is not even worth the postage and handling. This should be freeware. It is just text you insert various data into. Loads easily, no bugs, it works but is overrated in the description. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the person selling the software was very punctual and shipping the product otherwise it should get ""0"" stars. Dont waste your time, buy something else."
4,An odd mix,"On the internet, the Shadows are often confused with some blues group with titles like ""It Ain't Easy Being Sleazy."" That this group was not aware of the Shadows and so used their name casts doubt upon their musical credentials. This cd is by the real Shadows and Hank Marvin and includes their first huge hit ""Apache"" and more recent Hank Marvin solo efforts. Hank still puts out a good track every now and then, but overproduction and swamping from keyboards suffocate Hank's guitar sound. Their earlier version of ""Riders in the Sky"" would have been a better choice than this one. Still, this title gives a good idea of what Hank and the Shadows have been doing over the last 40 years. If you can only buy one Shadows cd, get ""Rockin with Curly Leads"" or the great compilation ""Shadows Are Go"""
4,The Definitive Version and Good Sound Quality!,"This ADD recording has surprisingly good sound quality for an older recording that hasn't been remastered. The performance by Bernstein and both the Columbia Symphonic and the NY Philharmonic on the pieces is simply breathtaking. You'd be hard pressed to find better interpretations of these Gershwin masterpieces. The only problem with this album is that it's very short and although would have been the perfect length on an lp or cassette as it was originally, it seems to be a waste of cd space here. Sony should probably remaster this and add some tracks like perhaps ""Porgy and Bess"" to make it a better value proposition. I hope they re-release a remastered version on mini-lp sleeve replica packaging too."
5,"must own if you're into sound art/theory/poetry, etc.","The title of my review says it all--this is an essential collection for anyone serious about sound art/theory/poetry or avant-garde music. The CD is a very nice bonus, full of unbelievable rarities as well."
2,Not what I was expecting,This isn't the book I was expecting but it was in good shape and a sweet gift book...just not what I was wanting.
1,Sinners in the Hands of an Angry Freud,"Mercy me, Dr. Bar-Levav; I had no idea we humans were such a contemptible lot! How far we have to go before we can live up the the rigid ideals of your orthodox Freudianism! Seriously, folks, this book might be useful to someone looking for historical perspective on the old, macho psychotherapy that blamed everything on the patient or the patient's Mommy, and did so little good for anyone. Don't recommend it otherwise. If you want some perspective on Dr. Bar-Levav, find a copy of ""The Power Tactics of Jesus Christ"" by disillusioned psychotherapist Jack Haley - ignore the title essay and read ""The Art of Psychotherapy."" If you came here looking for self-help, you'll find more relief in ""Taming Your Gremlin"" by Richard D. Carson - much shorter, much simpler, much more practical, and MUCH, MUCH less judgemental. ..."
5,Perfect for daydreamers,"I purchased for my room mate and best friend for Christmas last year, and it turned out to be the perfect gift. We are both avid outdoorsmen, and I thought this would be something to flip through while we were stuck at the University on weekends. The photographs are amazing, splendidly varied, and organized into sections so you don't have to dig through the pages to find the right picture for your mood. I would get lost looking through this book, the pictures really take you somewhere beautiful. Purchasing again for another friend this Christmas."
5,great ride over stock,Definately an upgrade from the beat up factory shocks. They help with towing some and keep the big suv on the road.
3,Not the best Lexx,This is probibly the weakest of the Lexx DVD but if you are a rabid Lexx fan than it is still worth the purchase. It slowly moves the story closer to the final confritation with mantrid as the crew realises that the Universe in being absorbed by Mantrid's drones. Some very funny scenes but all together not up to usual Lexx wit.
1,LEXXMANIAC -returns,Just wanted to say LEXX ON SCI-FI Return On January 25 2002at 10:00 pm.(eastern time) LEXX heats up its NEW Home...EARTH!ALSO 10:00 every friday after that or check local listings
3,Pretty good audio book,Smitten wouldn't be at the top of my favorites list but it is a fun audiobook. I liked the story of the single Mom trying to make a living and a new life for herself and her children... and finding romance at the same time. The flasher storyline was interesting at first but the character sort of fizzled at the end. This is a nice audiobook that plays out quickly and has lots of action.
1,Painful experience,"I really did NOT enjoy this book. I was open to something really light to listen to in the car, but this was not well written in my opinion. It moved as slow as molasses and was so improbable as to plot. I am not even sure I finished it, now that I think about it.I also did not care for the voice(s) of the narrator.Overall, a big waste of time."
5,A good start to a real one.,"My three old daughter, received this on Christmas from her grandmom. She enjoys putting in the pretend cds and pressing the play bottom. She feels she has her own cd player. The music is soft. It's great for a little girl who enjoys Barbie."
3,Beginner's Handbook of Woodcarving,"It's OK. It was not as informative as I would have liked, however I will use it as I start out as a novice wood carver."
3,Helpful,Not as much info as I would have liked but it is very helpful. especially for beginners. I will recommend this book.
4,Beginners Woodcarving,"Hmmmm, maybe I'm really toooo much of a beginner. This book was not enough to get me started or even inspired to start. I think it sort of assumes the reader already has some knowledge of tools or techniques. Maybe I'm just not ready yet, but I couldn't read this book and apply the information to the much smaller projects I had in mind."
2,Not helpful for a brand new beginner,I didn't like that it spends too much time on the different woods and not enough on the actual carving. I still don't know how to carve any better than before I got the book.
3,Ok book,Kind of just starter carving projects . Not at all what I thought the book would be about. I thought it would be more about techniques and tips. Ok book just a bit dated.
4,good book - lots of info,"This is a great primer. It has most of the basic information you'll need to get started. Not the best book however so if you are only going to read one, get the ""Woodcarving Course and Reference Manual"" by Chris Pye for about the same price. If you are going to read more than one beginners book, this would be my second choice."
3,Not bad but you could do better,"If you need an overview of woodcarving and were not very picky about the need for step by step assistance, this book would work for you. It does go over the basic cuts and offers text on a variety of topics in wood carving, i.e. types of woodcarving, tools, materials, painting, etc. It provides a number of patterns, many of them fairly cheesy and probably would not appeal to most starting out. There is a nice selection of bird patterns, but not much pictoral instructions on how to carve them. You would probably be better off with a different beginner's book with more appealing projects and then find books on specific woodcarving interests from there."
3,Beginners handbook,"A little disapointed when I first glanced through it, But it does have some very good information in this book as I reed through it it will be of great help to me. Thanks"
1,ultrak 360 stopwatch,I used this 3 times and already broke. Does not reset. I wouldn't buy this product anymore.Ultrak 360 Stopwatch
4,Good Timer,Use this for timing track events. Works well and easy to use. Can time splits in relays or keep track of laps in other events.Works well for all the events. Would recommend it.
5,Excelent product,"No more cough,I feel better, I recomended for smokers like me. Arrive on time, it last like two cigarretes pak."
4,Don't last as long as the claims state they do,"I've been using these filters for more than three years and they are certainly effective in removing tar. However, they clog easily. The clogging bears little relation to the amount of tar that fills the transparent chamber. So, there have been times when after only three cigarettes I felt like I was going to get a hernia if I tried to draw. Other times the filter continued to work even when it collected so much tar that it seeped into the mouthpiece, leaving a bitter taste.A bag of 100 filters is a good deal, so, in the end, it balances out."
4,Great!,"My husband and I haven't used them for long but so far we like them. I really like how I can see the tar that is caught, the first thing I said when I seen it was that it makes you want to quit smoking. I smoke different brands of menthols, right now I'm smoking Camel Crush (crushed) and that's all I've used in the Filters so far. The fact that Camel Crush is already a light cigarette makes it where I need to smoke some of the cigarette without the disposable filter or I'm going back for another one too quickly. I'm sure the other menthols I smoke won't be like that but I won't know until I try it. My Cigarette fits perfectly into the filter, not too tight or too loose. I like it, great Filters!"
5,Another excellent CD in a great series,"This CD is just one in an excellent music series that is every bit as good as the more popular Le Chant Du Monde anthology produced by Mario Bois. The music here features a relatively unknown artist named Roman El Granaino but each track is beautifully played and all 16 selections attest to his great artistry. Roman's touch is clean and lyrical and has a crisp rasgueado attack that provides the framework for his playing. His technique is of high quality and the mystery is why he has not appeared on other collections. Perhaps Mario Bois series is meant to showcase only the big names of flamenco while the lesser lights are ignored. There are several other CDs in this set that are difficult to find but locating them would be a worthwhile effort. Aficionados of flamenco would enjoy the music of these unknown but top quality players as much as they do the wonderful playing of Sabicas, Ricardo and Montoya."
5,Mind Monsters,I highly recommend Mind Monsters to any in for a good book. Robert Montesino has a way of wowing his readers and this collection is no exception.
4,Exactly as the title states,"The book is exactly as the title states. It explains the philosophy, history, and rules of Kendo. It also has illustrations for the techniques so you can learn them. You still need to study Kendo in person to learn it, but this book is good as a reference book in case you haven't practiced something in awhile. It also has the terminology, which is useful to know as a student."
5,"The first place of the podium is a great master, this book: the second place.","THE most complete work in Kendo I have ever seen.Cover techniques with one and two swords (shinai), as well as KendoKata. Good text and good imagery. If you practice the way (D), or are interested in the art, you need this at the side of your bed."
1,Someone Pinch Me!,"This has to be the most amazing CD in the entire world. Not the music mind you, but that fact that it even exists at all. Maybe I should burn an MP3 of this thing and make it available for download on KaZaa. Now THAT would be a reason the buy this ""music""."
2,Disappointed,"When I buy sailor moon DVD's I buy them because they contain the original Japanese Uncut version. This doesn't have that. If you liked the American version and want it on DVD then your wish has been granted because this is it. Personally, I'm disappointed with the fact that all the other series have the original Japanese versions but this one. It makes my collection incomplete. But as I said if you liked the American versions and weren't looking for the Japanese I'd say this product is for you."
4,A SHORT COMMENTARY ON DOOM TREE SERIES,Doom tree series is actually an extension and continues after Sailor Moon has Defeated Queen Beryl and the Negaverse. Okay series but I prefer the season when we are first introduced to Reeny.
1,Don't be fooled...stay away from this one!,"This DVD is nothing but a disappointment. It is an unauthorized recitation of the facts any Foo fan can easily find elsewhere in numerous magazines, websites, and interviews. You won't even hear any Foo music here. Sloppy and tacky. I regret giving the producers of this sham any of my money."
1,Truly a disappointment,"I've been a diehard Foo fan for years, purchasing everything I can get my hands on that is associated with them. Granted this DVD biography is not officially licensed, it is not nearly worth the money. You learn the bare facts about the band, but you could just get online and learn just as much. If you're in the market for a Foo DVD, please use your money on the fantastic live DVD Everywhere But Home."
1,"Rap, not metal","I was fooled by the artists name, and the title of the cd. Just as there are two Michael Angelo's, (One folk, one metal) so are there two Nitros (rap, and metal). This is not the heavy metal band Nitro fronted by guitar wizard Michael Angelo. If your into the rap Nitro you may like this cd. I listened to a few cuts and found it's not for me. Good luck."
4,Popa shines.,"Probably one of the most outstanding blues-rock guitarists on the scene today, Popa displays all shades of his blues on this live DVD. He engineered the 5.1 digital recording himself, too, and the quality is excellent. It's a bit limited in the quantity of songs, but some are extended instrumentally, allowing for his 6-string flair to shine. A must for blues-rock fans."
5,Great stories that give insight of Brazilian culture.,"This book is, I would say, at an intermediate level of Portuguese. The stories are great and the format of the book is excellent with questions following each short story. There are also a number of b/w pictures and drawings that add to the experience."
4,it works like he does on the mic,"it makes sense to put out another street banger for c- rayz..we all heard him on countless guest appearances from the def-jukies and stronghold mix tapes to the blaze battles. he has all the right elements.this ep is no doubt another hit from c- rayz. rest assured his style has never chaged. he steps it up in the first 6 tracks. i enjoyed listening to this many times. i think if more people listened to the underground hiphop that c-rayz embraces, it could take a turn away from the ""rims and timbs"" glamour and desentizing rhymes/mainstream madness. i have been highly influenced by defjux and the hiphop they produce."
4,A Romantic's Romantic Digs Deeper,"Yevgeny Yevtushenko was the darling of the 1950's and 1960's jet setters who wanted a peek into the Russian soul in the midst of the Cold War. Having survived being fashionable, Yevtuskenko best loved mid-live poems grace the pages of ""Stolen Apples"". Enjoy!"
4,Musically excellent - disjointed download,"Recorded in 1960, this is an enthusiastic rendering of Orff's work. The Philadelphia orchestra is perfect as one would expect. Janice Harsanyi (soprano) Harve Presnel (baritone) and Rudolf Petrack (tenor) offer reasonable competence in the performance of solo passages. The Rutgers University Choir under the direction of F. Austin Walter gives a marvelous effort. Considering that the Rutgers group were non-professionals (or semi-professionals) they provided an excellent (if imprecise) performance. The youngest of the performers on this recording is today nearing seventy.No, it's not digital - but it's still one of the best out there.On a negative note (likely an Amazon issue): after downloading the piece would not retain movements in the correct order."
2,Terrible Sound Quality!,"I'm seriously beginning to doubt that any good version of ""Carmina Burana"" exists on disc today. I've heard a few versions and all of them sound terrible. Low volume levels and terrible sound quality means that we can only hope and pray that Sony gets its act together and remaster the entire ""Great Performances"" catalog very soon. Not recommended!"
4,GOOD FOR POKEMON FANATICS!,"My daughter loves Pokemon and collects the cards. She and her step brother are always playing with their cards and sharing ideas when they get together. If they like it, I am happy."
3,"Works great, second hand can be confusing","works great, however the second hand can be confusing to a 5 year old. maybe only use one ball to represent it."
2,Doesn't keep time,"It is very cute watch and helped my 6 year old learning telling time. But it keeps falling behind. I returned to Amazon and got a new one, which still falls behind. Changing batteries didn't help either"
4,Chainsaw Bar and Chain,An excellent value for my proposes. The replacement bar and chain arrived well in advance of the expected time. The items fit and performed as hoped for. I do not cut a lot of wood but when I fire up my Poulan saw I expect it to perform well. This new addition to my cutting equipment did what was expected. I'll buy again.
5,"Nice 20"" bar and chain combo",The price with shipping charge is not much cheaper than some place else. The combo is nicely packeted in original packet.
5,Disappointed ABC cancelled such a great show!,I loved this show it was funny inspiring classy and no other show had so detailed fashion. The characters are really talented actors I hope ABC does a movie I miss this because this was one of the few really good shows on tv to watch thank goodness the complete series is available for purchase. This dvd was money well spent! You won't be disapointed especially if you are a fashion fanatic like me! tear tear I really miss the show!
5,Amazing show,I wish this wasn't the final season - such a good show. The DVD series is good quality - and worth the purchase. You'll enjoy it!
5,Bettylicious!!!!!,"This show is simply amazing!! I believe they cut it off a bit short and wish there would have been another season. :( Either way, they picked the best ending possible. Yay!! Detty!!!!"
5,BEST EVER,Now Ugly Betty has been my best loves or all loves. Love this comedy. I was able to watch series after series uninterrupted. Can you imagine that? Love the ending..... Funny as always! This was not disappointing to me.
4,Betty is Beautiful,"It is so sad that this show is over! I have been an avid watcher since the show began, and really enjoyed the show's important message: love yourself for who you are, not how you look. I enjoyed the character's transformation from shy insecure teenager to a more confident, self-assured, young adult. If you are new to the show, this season is the best one in my opinion."
5,dramady,haven't even opened it up but i sure got a great deal from the seller because it still had the best buy label on it yet thank-you amazon seller...tonylfriend...
5,great end mill,"i have used this cutter to mill 7071-T6 aluminum and it works great! razor sharp, accurate cuts that accomplish what i need to. i will soon be purchasing an entier set of this name brand end mills."
1,This is NOT a good film,"Usually I love to watch gay films, they are fun for me. But, I have to say I have not seen one this bad since I started watching gay movies. It was slow watching to me, and most of the ""Acting"" flat and nothing to like about most of the charectors. I was hoping that it would get over with. Wish I had NEVER bought it."
1,Another bad movie in an unreliable genre,"When people set out to make gay themed films, it seems the last thing on their minds is film. These people shouldn't be making films - they are so bad at it. Slutty Summer is simply another in a long line of bad gay films. And for some unknown reason Americans do this worse than just about any other major film making nation. Why? This film is poorly scripted, directed and badly acted. Guys, get your priorities right. Please!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY/ WASTE OF TIME...,"...fresh out of junior high type movie with a bunch of bad acting queens, but if you liked ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" enjoy the show."
5,Technique and passion blended brilliantly,"A beautiful album that you will deeply enjoy. The second track is particularly lovely. The two performers complement each other perfectly. This is an album for both the classical music collector, and also a perfect gift for someone you would like to introduce to classical music."
4,Looks nice next to other feeders,"This feeder looks particularly nice hanging next to feeders of other types, including tube feeders and the traditional ""barn"" type feeder. It stands up to the moisture of the pacific northwest, too, so I think it's well made."
5,All-Star Feeder,"I give this a 5-start rating because 5 is all there are! I bought this for my mother, who has everything, she loved it. It is lovely, classy, and very well constructed. The only difficulty was that the copper roof has a layer of celophane that is difficult to remove (which is of course an advantave if you don't want a copper patina-effect). Nice product."
3,Beautiful but not squirrel proof,"I enjoyed this lovely feeder all winter long until this spring, when the squirrels discovered it. They destroyed the thing. They broke the wood supports, chewed off the rope, and even started eating the plastic feeder tube! So, as attractive as it is, I would not recommend this feeder if you live in an area prone to squirrel abuse!"
5,A vivid account of racing and the bloodstock business,"Anyone with an interest in horseracing will enjoy Glenye Cain's behind-the-scenes look at the thoroughbred industry; and newcomers to the sport will find plenty to entertain them in these pages too. Cain has an eye for the details that make vivid this self-contained and expensive world: the quirks of the owners, breeders, trainers and horses. She conveys the atmosphere of the sales ring as wealthy owners do battle, of a stud farm late at night as a mare gives birth, of Churchill Downs racecourse as trainers prepare their expensive and fragile charges for the Kentucky Derby. In love with the industry, she does not neglect its darker side. After reading The Home Run Horse, you'll watch horseracing with new insight and enthusiasm."
3,gets tangled,"I bought this jump rope because I wanted to work out in my apartment without having to walk to my apartment complex's gym in the cold Michigan winter. The rope is wound up and tied up when it is packaged, and even after 5-6 uses and letting the handles hang down when I'm not using it, the rope is still bent in all the same places it was bent when it was packaged. Also, I tried to shorten the rope (I'm 5'8"") by opening the bottom of each handle, pulling the rope out, and tying a knot, but when I do that, the rope can't rotate freely, and it twists up to the point where I have to stop jumping and untwist it; I have to do that every 10 rotations or so. So then I let the rope back out to its original length, but that results in hitting the ceiling once in a while (luckily, I know my upstairs neighbor). Overall, a decent rope with some design flaws."
1,Dont bother,"If you are looking for a jump rope to work out with, dont bother with this one, it's a cheap rendition and you'd be better off with a piece of rope from a boating store. The plastic is so hard you really feel the misses and all the kinks have not worked themselves out.if the shipping were cheaper than the cost of the product, I'd return it."
1,Definitely not a speed rope!!,"I have owned many different ropes and this is the heaviest one I have ever used. The advertisement describes it as a ""speed rope"". That description is totally misleading. If you want a true speed rope, order one of the ropes from Buddy Lee on this site."
4,Love it,"I really like the Harginer 9-Foot Adjustable Speed Jump Rope. It is well designed and turns easily at the handle making it move very nicely. The Rope itself is just a tad heavier than I'd like it to be, but not such a big deal.For the price, it is a wonderful simple addition to any fitness program. I use it daily. The only complaint I have is that no instructions came with how to 'adjust' the rope... so I improvised and just tied 2 knots at the end. It works."
1,Keeps twisting up,I used this rope for over two weeks hoping that the fact that it keeps twisting up on itself was just because it was new and needed to be broken in. After two weeks I gave up. It kept twisting up on itself and I would have to stop in the middle of jumping to unwind it. A few jumps later it would be all twisty again. I ended up buying a better quality jumprope that works beautifully.
2,Overrated!,"I'm really surprised at how highly rated this jump rope is. First of all, I think the claim that this rope is adjustable is a little misleading. To adjust it, you have to remove the caps and tie the ends in the appropriate spot. It would be nice if it came with clamps of some sort that you could clamp on in the right spot to adjust. My other complaint is that it gets far too twisted up! I store mine by hanging it up to reduce tangling, but the rope tends to twist up in the middle as I'm jumping, forcing me to stop jumping and fix the rope."
2,So so rope,"I saw this at the Vitamin Shoppe and since I'm always willing to try new jump ropes, I picked it up. I like these type of speed ropes, the ones with ball bearing and a rubber encasing over the rope. I find that it spins smoothly and fast and its easier to do tricks that a lightweight speed rope (although not as easy as the beaded ropes for trick but overall, I like the speed rope better). This rope is adequate if you just want to skip, do some crossovers and some double unders etc. But the rubber is too stiff thus it doesn't unkink all that well and turning action isn't that great even though it has bearings. I've also bought an Altus speed rope similar to this which was marginally better. Believe it or not, the Sports Authority brand of ""professional"" speed rope is far superior than either. The rubber is much softer and it turns a lot faster and smoother. Still, this is a servicable rope, I'm sure you can get a very good workout and if that's all you want, then I recommend it."
5,Perfect rope for its money,"After a month of use the rope snapped like you say, but do you seriously expext from a $10 rope to last 1-2-3 years? You work for this rope an hour, but in my country I had to work around 12 hours to buy it, as it costs ~$17 here. Then why you scream more than I do?I will tell you what I did when the rope snapped. I kept the handles as they have nice bearings. I bought 3 meters of 3mm thick steel rope covered with 1mm PVC (5mm in diameter overall). It costs $1.50 per meter. I cut the excess rope and attached it to the handles using cable ties. Now that rope is indestructible! It is a little lighter than the original rope, but it is not a problem. Nothing has happened after a month of use. I guess it's more likely the handles to give up than the rope to snap.Take care of yourself, guys, and use your brain :)P.S. Excuse me for my bad English."
3,satisfactory but a bit heavy,"Overall, it is quite satisfactory with several tries.However, it is a bit heavier than I expected."
3,Indoor use only? Maybe?,"I upgraded my good'ol leather jump rope to this one. I really like it. Ball bearing makes it goes very smooth and fast, and I can do way better than I could with my old one.But after 2 weeks, it snapped. I used it three times a week for 15-20 minutes each time, and it snapped from the middle of the rope.Yes, I used it on concrete ground on my drive way, but after TWO WEEKS???If I have an indoor space to work out, I would have done so, but I don't think many people get to be that lucky. If I have a gym to go to, I wouldn't need the jump rope to warm up.I liked the product, but I would suggest to use it only on flooring."
4,Good but not great!!!,"I have tried different speed ropes throughout the last 2 years. Here is my opinion on the 4 ropes I tried. The best I tried was the Buddy Lee Master speed rope with the Aero speed a close 2nd. They are smooth, comfortable and fast. However, the Aero speed is a bit light. The Harbinger comes in 3rd. Its a really good rope, but I did not like the handles which were a bit uncomfortable and the end caps fell off constantly. The last was the Valeo which was a bit light to the touch. All of these ropes will suit any one who likes jumping rope. Its a matter of personal preference."
5,better rope than those in the gyms,"Initially, I thought I would get the cheap quality jump rope. I was wrong. It is a smooth simple medium-weight rope that swings without twisting the chord. Although it seems to be slightly long for my height(5'10), I managed to jump more than 500 times without stopping. With the cheap ones at the gym, I could only jump around 300 times. So, it gets me going. And, that satisfies me."
3,U could do better.,okay jump rope but because it does not turn on ball bearings it twists and tangles horribly in 60-80 turns.
1,This rope is the WORST,The quality of this product is terrible. It's impossible to resize and after only two weeks of use mine split in two. DO NOT BUY!
5,Simply the Best,"This album is genius. Definately the best of ELO's and one of the best albums in the history of the universe. Their Greatest Hits should have ALL these songs on it, it's just one gorgeous piece of music after another. This is Jeff's masterpiece. It' one of the albums I can just listen to over and over and over and over and love it more each time."
5,Prophetic commentary on our times...,"Classic Jeff Lynne style, speaks to the spirit of man lost in a technobabble jungle. If you like songs that can get sentimental in a dweeby like manner, this is for you."
3,ELO in space,"Funny that a band that use to perform live in a mock spaceship during the 1970s waited until the 1980s to release an album with a science fiction theme. ""Time"" is a moderately successful experiement with a few great songs, ""Twilight,"" ""The Rain is Falling"" and ""Hold on Tight."" The filler material aims for a futuristic mood that it occasionally manages to capture. Though not among their best albums, ""Time"" is worthwhile for ELO fans."
4,She should be better known,"I recently attended a performance by Ms. Eisenhour in Auburn Wa. She currently teaches a jazz choir program at Green River CC in that city. She is an excellent jazz singer but I had never heard of her. I found this album on Amazon.com. She does an excellent set of songs backed by fine musicians. My favorite is ""Wheelers and Dealers"" which was written by David Frishberg, one of my favorites. I hope you'll at least give this album a listen if your a jazz fan."
2,VERY hard to start,"Lengthy assembly, very hard to start,been working over an hour, still hasn't started, new right out of box, gas, oil, plug, everything by the book, properly primed etc. still won't start.Had the previous version of this exact machine for 10 years, great product, this one; forget it!"
5,"Awesome, Affordable and Durable","I bought this mower about 5 years ago. A single woman, I never paid attention to oil changes or maintenance schedules. Just a week ago, I though I needed a new machine when the cord got stuck and would not recoil. It motivated me to learn to do my own maintenance on the mower.A clean, new air filter, a freshly sharpened blade and a new spark plug later with a healthy oil change proved to me how resilient this little machine is, and how sturdy it is. With its new parts and a good clean up, the little thing started working like new.If it can endure my abuse, believe me, it is a good product! I mow an area of about 1/8 acre. Very, very happy with my machine that is still faithful to my yard."
1,piece of junk but light & cheap,"Yard Machines 11A-020B000 20-Inch 148cc Briggs & Stratton 300 Series Side Discharge Gas Powered Push Lawn MowerI bought one of these 2 years ago from HOME DEPOT. It lasted one season and wouldn't run anymore. I took in for warranty, I got it back for a $75.00 charge(?). Their report said it needed a spark plug, the carb repaired, and that the engine was failing. It ran half of this season and died again. I hauled it to the dump. It also used a lot of gas!"
4,So far so good,Good mower for the price. It is noisy and a little heavy but does the job.Height adjustment is manual but if you set it low enough then you should be good to go.This mower is mainly for people that don't have good grass and uneven back yards. You probably want a better mower if you have good grass. The lawn mower is sturdy and I dont have any complains against it.I would recommend this mower at this price.
5,Lawn Mower,"This lawn mower is really light weight and this is important to me.On these hot days of summer I must cut around the sides of my house where the riding lawn mowerwon't go, this mower makes the chore easy.I had another more expensive heavy-duty lawn mower, but it was so hard to push that I am selling it."
1,Terrible product,Got this for my son he used it 3 times and now it won't stay running. Just a waste of money.
3,"yard machines 20"" lawnmower","I have used this very same mower for better than 8 yrs. The one difference is, mine has a techunseh engine. Has worked flawwlessly until this year. Mower is difficult to start & won't remain running. Changed the extremely dirty air filter, oil, just normal maintainance. Everything else is fine, best light duty mower for the buck. Hope the B&S engine is more reliable."
1,Uncomfortable on purchasing mower.,"Looking for a replacement mower, found this Lawn Machine but having read the reviews both good and bad I'm afraid to buy this product. It would be my luck to buy a lemon and have no recourse. Amazon should improve it's warranty guaranty so that customers can take the mower to local repair shops for warranty service."
3,Adjusted,"(Adjusted review) After fixing this lawnmower once receiving a lemon, it has worked fine. Admittedly, I was put off by having to break out the toolbox before ever having mowed my lawn, but since then it has been reliable."
3,description wrong,"in the description of this mower, it states mulch/side dischargethere is no cover plate over the side discharge area, to allow clippingsto be mulched. all clippings are discharged thru the side opening.otherwise mower operates ok and is a bargain for the price and operation."
2,The album versions were better,"This download only contains two of the versions from the album. I was very disappointed by the re-mix of the old tunes. Much more 70's like and much less of the soulful, poetic sounding Fogelberg."
5,I have been looking for this for 3 yrs now....,I wanted this one song I have been looking for 3 yrs now. Finally my best friend told me what it was called and who sang it. So I ordered it. Shipped in a decent amount of time and I am very pleased with it.
5,Excellent Composition of hard to find & never released songs,"If you love country music,(then brother hold on to your cowboy hats!!!!) This is the only CD that contains Lionel Cartwright's never released song ""Be My Angel"". I also love all the other songs but I have been trying for years, without much luck, to find this selection on compact disc. Rated in my eyes 5 Stars, a must have if you are a true Lionel Cartwright fan."
2,"Sorry, but Spanish accent is bad","I love Bryan Duncan's voice and most of his songs and the words to his songs. All of these songs are translated from various albums of his, so you may know the song and like it in English, but unfortunately his accent in Spanish is so harsh that native Spanish speakers can't hardly bring themselves to listen to him, no matter how great the voice nor how powerful the meaning of the words. I live in a Spanish-speaking country and I'm sorry to say that they won't listen to more than one song without copying and making fun of his Spanish, it's too much of a distraction."
2,Although there are some good points.....,"This book scares me. I picture it being very dangerous getting into the wrong hands. I am imagining a poorly educated, and scruple-less person taking this book home, studying it in depth and deciding they can make a living this way. Just the title paints the wrong picture. I just feel that this is the wrong notion to put in peoples heads. We all need help some time. Although there are some amazing practices mentioned and reat concepts and ideas put forth in this book there can never be a catch all method for every horse. I don't think that anyone should set forth to ""break"" a horse (only to gentle them anyways) alone. It is not a job that will come without complications and sometimes an easy fix will do just that, but usually will pop up later as a much bigger, and much more dangerous problem."
1,very bad video quality,Extremely bad video quality - have never seen such a low-quality product. Producer of this DVD should in good faith mention the quality of the product.
4,You get what you pay for,"It's not as sturdily built as the Canon charger, but this one does the trick. I bought two batteries and the charger. One of the fragile tabs that holds the battery in place broke off on the charger (I have to be more careful putting the battery in place now), and one of the battery lasts no longer than about 14 pictures, but the convenience of having a car charger is nice. All this for less than the cost of buying a single Canon brand battery. I'd do it again."
1,Don't buy this Battery Charger,"I have now owned two of these chargers. The first one broke after about 3 months. The replacement showed up at my doorstep DOA.Clearly, this charger is designed poorly and manufactured cheaply."
1,not what they said it is,Ad and packaging state the unit is variable speed. Unit was only two speed!! No variable settings. Not what was advertised
2,"Good while it worked, but..","Bought this and was happy with it for two years. A couple of days ago I volunteered to bring some barbeque to work, set it on low overnight, came back in the mornign and nothing had happened. It seems like now low turn it up to about 75 degrees, and high brings it up to 150. Not what I had in mind. After my mother had used her crockpot for 30 years, I was hoping for more than 2."
1,Fast Cooker,"I purchased this, as most do, because of the quart capacity. On the low setting, it boils like mad. The meats in Kentucky Burgoo and Green Pepper steak overcooked in a short amount of time. The low setting is only slightly lower than the high setting. I would like to cook some recipes for five to six hours. But no - this is not a slow cooker. Most other reviews I have read have not had this problem, so I might consider returning this item for another.If I had this to do over again, I would probably spend more and try to purchase a little better quality cooker than this Chinese model. I am assuming it was imported from China or elsewhere. Hope this helps! L. Clark"
4,My wife likes it,"I bought this cooker for my wife because she said she wanted one that was bigger than the old crock pots, and it is bigger plus somewhat lighter, too. She says it doesn't seem to overcook the food and she really likes it, but to give it 5 stars it would have to have another feature that it lacks, a timer that would shut it off automatically after a certain length of time. All in all, however, it is fine and she is quite satisfied."
2,Developed Cracks,"I bought this unit to make large batches of spaghetti sauce and chili, and its capacity was sufficient, hence the 2-star rating instead of only 1. After only about 2-1/2 years of use [only about 4 times per year], the ceramic pot developed hairline cracks. This replaced a different brand we had that had lasted over 20 years. I e-mailed customer service and asked if they sold replacement pots. It has been over two weeks and no response. One would think that they wouldn't ignore a paying customer. Another reviewer did get a price from the manufacturer: $30 plus shipping. For the price of a whole new unit, you can buy two regular 6-quart pots, which is what I should have done in the first place and will do instead of wasting time with customer service."
1,the absolute worst...,"We purchased this product 10/09 and by 1/10 the crock developed a hairline crack. We use two other crock pots several years older and there are no cracks on them, so we know how to care for the ceramic pot. Customer service points out that non-electric parts are not covered and provides a price list. A new crock shipped is almost thirty dollars. What a rip off when a new unit (that does cook too hot, even on the lowest settings) is forty dollars. Spend your money elsewhere, I know I will."
1,Cooks at way too high a temp..,"This slow cooker can be dangerous. We cooked chili in it on Low for several hours and then turned it to warm for a few hours. When my fiance ate some, it was so hot that he got a huge blister on his lip. We tried it again and it definitely made things boiling hot."
5,Great Program for Adults with ADD and ADD Coaches,"The ADD Audio Coach program is a wonderful AD/HD resource. It is an excellent alternative for those with AD/HD who are not quite ready to work with a live AD/HD coach.The ADD Audio Coach program offers some great tips and strategies for some of the most common AD/HD related problems. Both the CDs and the workbook are broken down into small sections which makes the program very ""ADD Friendly"".In addition to being a great resource for people with AD/HD, The ADD Audio Coach program could be a great tool for AD/HD Coaches to use with their clients."
4,A Walk Worth Taking,Walking with Angels by J. Allen JahnigThis book definitely makes you take a look inward and ask yourself if you've done everything you need to do to prepare yourself to face Jesus. Most people will not get a second chance like this author did. The story of the accident and its aftermath is intriguing. The author's struggles to come back after his near death experience are inspiring. The comparisons he gives are great advice on how to lead a Christian life by example.
1,Walking With Angels,I found the first chapter very informative and it stuck with the title of the book. I would recommend people read the first chapter then put the book down. The rest of the book seems to be the ramblings of a man who has no idea of how a book should be constructed. It seems as though he just put down what ever came into his head. I would Not recommend this book to anyone.
2,"like ""Roost"" sessions, dreadful pressing quality.","Like the ""Roost Sessions"", there are some good, cool, VERY early, undated Getz performances. By the sound quality, I would estimate about 1950 or so.Dreadful technical quality in the recordings, much worse than ""Roost"", if you can imagine, some recordings transcribed from LP's (78's?) with pops and scratches.Recording quality mars Stan in these warm, cool, reserved sessions. Stan, as usual is great, with a lot of ballads.Backup band sounds mediocre, journeyman performers(?) May have been cut during his Swedish exile.(?)No credits.If you like ""Roost"" you may like this."
3,Description not correct,"Amazon product description says up to 28 volts but packaging clearly states up to 12 volts. After receiving the product, I checked the Lisle website and it states up to 12 volts as well. The product quality seems good but if I had known it was only good for 12 volts, I may have purchased something different."
2,Short lifespan,"My first one died within a few weeks, so I bought another. That died too after only a few weeks. Maybe it's because I didn't leave it on all the time? Maybe the powering up and turning it off shortened its lifespan? I wish these came with a guarantee. Otherwise, they're fascinating!"
3,Looks cool but isn't bright.,"I ordered this for my boyfriend and myself because our last night light went out and we both thought this one looked pretty neat. While it does look pretty badass, it can't light up a room. at all. so keep that in mind before you buy it :)"
1,Not Well Constructed,"I got a couple of these a few years back. They're pretty poor construction. They kind of fall out of the socket, and the top part doesn't feel like it screwed into the bottom part properly. One died after only a couple of weeks, and I've stopped using the second one."
1,Died after 6 hours of use,"Plugged it in....looked beatiful.....but after 6 hrs, I glanced over where it was plugged in, and the unit no longer worked....nuff said :("
1,"used battery sold as ""new""","I was worried that it might be fake, but it looks like a genuine Nokia battery by the presence of the holograms. However, they are not new batteries. They have dents and scratches, and general grime all over it to show that it was used and removed from another cell phone and is now sold on Amazon as ""new."" The battery doesn't hold a charge for more than 2 days. False advertising. Since it only cost under $10, it was more trouble than it was worth for me to file a claim, dispute the charge, etc. etc."
1,Nokia N90 battery review,"The replacement battery did not work. Not sure why. Since it was relatively inexpensive, I did not return it. I am still getting by with the old battery."
1,bad battery,"The battery looked like mine previous genuine Nokia, but it was definitely heavier. One that I ordered did not work at all: it took charge only for three-four hours even without speaking. I asked and received refund."
4,Good OEM battery,I was really glad to find this battery as every store I looked in did not have one of this size. Actually there was one store but the price was 3x the cost.The only issue that I might have with the battery is the life is a bit shorter than the original one.
4,very nice,"Has a great shape and fits smoothly. Thick straps for extra shoulder comfort. Only thing I didnt like about this is if you dont like underwires be warned, although there is no underwire with this there is a plastic strip down the sides. I am sure it is for shape but for me it was umcomforable so I had to remove it. Would definatly get this agian even with that piece."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT GOOD,"This book is not what I expected. This book is truly Unauthorized, Phil Jackson would not accept this book. It is a book of random quotes that are pretty useless. I would suggest his Hoops book instead. That is a great read."
