3,Good music... just too short.,"Don't get me wrong, the music on this CD is very good. It's in usual Melvins fashion, heavy and melodic. The thing is, the entire album is less than 22 minutes long. This CD is really for a true Melvins fan. Beginners might want to try something like the ""10 songs"" album. Or maybe even Honky."
3,Good starting point,"This book is good in that it is a good starting point if you are considering doing any fine figure photography. The pictures are very dated in the styling as is to be expected, but the information contained on posing, backgrounds, lighting was useful. Some a bit technical, but informative."
2,"Deborah Harry in the buff, little other appeal","This book is in a certain demand because a young, mousy-brown-haired Debbie Harry-later to be the singer for the rock group Blondie-is shown in her skyclad, young (24-25) splendor. Other than that, it's simply a book on female nude art-photography modeling of which many appeared in the 1965-1980 timeframe.Harry, bluntly, is no Bardot or Monroe in 'figure impact'-she's pretty boyish,in all honesty. But in Europe and other non-US rock markets, she's as big a star as Mick Jagger or Prince, so this book does have a certain value especially in those markets.There are a lot of how-to texts on posing nude female models out there and this one has no particular advantage over current titles. If it's classic nudes you want to study, viewing the work of true masters like Bunny Yeager (particularly with Bettie Page) or Bert Stern (nude essayist of Monroe) will probably be more useful."
5,Delightful,"This delightful young woman touches her body and masturbates in what looks like a structured masturbation session. The way she makes love to herself is very simple and real. I liked the way she looked at her body in the mirror; she seems truly pleased by what she sees.She looks very comfortable on the bed as she prepares, and the reminder to relax is given throughout. The fact that she is so relaxed is noticeable to the viewer, and this seems like a crucial element to the technique presented. The focus of the massage is on her clitoris which is an uncomplicated technique, yet she looks very sexy doing it.I would highly recommend this for women interested in being more playful and experimenting with their sexuality."
1,Extremely Disappointed,I bought this DVD as a present for my husband for xmas. I was pursuaded becuase of the great reviews. I got the DVD and previewed it before wrapping it. Oh my what a waste. I want to return it becuase it is so bad. Do not buy this DVD as a gift or for any reason for that matter. You will be extremely disappointed.
2,How About Something Different,"How Many Videos Have they made on the Masterbation Subject?Sometimes A Theme can be overdone! How About Something DifferentThis is an over rated video and there may be some value however, it is way too expensive for the little value you get. There are far better videos and martial books (not to mention cheaper) that can teach you many aspects of female orgasm as oppose to this video focusing on one aspect of female orgasm.How About Something Different, For Instance The Art Of Oral is just as important and takes the same if not more skill. They should make a comprehensive tutorial for womenlearning oral how to perform oral ( on male and female )Hey How about a Different Theme For change! It just might boost sales!"
2,Not the best,"I pre-ordered this DVD hoping it would be slightly different from the other two I purchased that are in the DVD format. First off, some of the scenes are blurred and out of focus. And second off, I find it very hard to believe that females masturbate in this fashion with just one finger the entire time. I want reality, and being a man who has some experience in this area, I know this is not. Another volume is coming out at the end of July 2005, I just hope it's photographed better, meaning in focus and closer. Plus I hope the woman is allowed to do it the correct way, and not in a restricted fashion. Thanks."
2,This is not Might and Magic,"This is what happens when a company (Ubisoft) buys the rights to call whatever they produce by the same name as a successful franchise (3DO's Might and Magic series) in order to fool people into buying their software.If you were expecting a continuation of the great Might and Magic series, don't waste your money, this isn't it. I haven't gotten far enough to tell you what you will get, but so far it seems like little more than a narrated movie with you being pulled along by your nose. Hopefully it will improve...So far I am very disappointed."
1,Full of bugs,Do not purchase this game. It has many many bugs. THe game will not load past the first chapter causing frequent freezes and lockups.
1,crap,"this game is crap - there should be a notice that for even simple movement, there is extensive key board interaction required. never got to experience any of the game itself as I gave up in frustration after several minutes of just trying to navigate the character. bummer."
1,Why does the game always freeze up?,i have a very high end computer and this game just refused to play smooth. Dont you love it when youre on your horse and it freezes up every 5 seconds? Never had this problem with Oblivion. Save your money people unless you have a super fast million dollar computer!
3,First person slasher.. pretty good,"It's a fun, beautiful, and innovative fusion of different game styles. The extensive spider and crypt environments go on a bit too long but overall it's a fun adventure with absurd/campy voice acting.About the only thing that was not very well done was the weapons/equipment selection. The game doesn't pause or slow or anything while you're in the selection layover and you have no control over your character at that time.. so if you need something fast from your inventory while action is happening, you're history."
4,Huge Playability,"Dark Messiah is a very playable adventure, with wonderful graphics and sound to enhance the environments. I did feel that I wanted more free world gameplay- but one is limited to a single character in I believe 12 chaptered locations. At any rate, I love it- and strongly recommend this game."
3,lacked in longetivity,"For an action rpg, this game is extremely linear and short, it is a blast while you are playing it but ends like the 2nd day! I would recommend elder scrolls oblivion over this game, although very very fun, it seems like it leaves you wanting so much more, there is a huge empty feeling this game leaves you with, thats the only way I can explain it."
2,Save Your Money,For $50 you'd think the developers would spend a little more time creating quality graphics. I'm running a high end card (nvidia 8800 GTS) and this game looks like it was created 10 years ago.
1,Not Compatible with Windows 7,"This game is not Compatible with Windows 7. I put the compatibility to windows XP pack 2, I made sure my drivers where up to date and both patches were installed. I am not able to go forward using th W key or any key. I emailed support for this software they told me that this is not compatible with windows 7. I suggest you do not buy this product if you have windows 7 or thinking about up grading."
1,Beware serious performance problems,"This game could have been tremendous! I really loved the demo and it played OK for the first few levels. However, it quickly turned into a problem and performance made the game play very slow and then crash out completely. I am a computer professional and have a pretty good machine. I worked for weeks trying to get it to run right and found that for some people, the game runs fine but others have a nightmare experience for which there is no resolution. If you're one of the lucky ones this could be a great game. For me - it was disaster. The company is no help. The forums provided no answers that worked."
3,Dark Messiah dissappointing,"Very disappointing. Took me only 2 days to finish the game. Not worth $49.00. Also, I'm a big Might and Magic fan; this game is NOT AT ALL like the other M&M games. You are the only person, no companions. No buying/selling items and equipment in stores (no stores). When you get a stronger weapon or armor, just throw the old one away. No sleeping to recharge yourself. Not a large variety of weapons, armor or magic. No exporing. Just one long endless quest. OK game for a role playing fanatic-But very disappointing for a M & M fan."
3,"Awesome Game mechanics, Weak World","This game is some nice eye candy. The game engine and Combat system are very interesting and fun, Great voice acting.However it quickly grows dull, because there is no ""World"" to explore. It is basicly Halflife-esque. A series of small linear quests, makes you feel led around by the nose (wich you are).Just no staying power. I have logged maybe 10 hours into this game, the first 6 were real fun, Now i would just as soon play an old game.Its worth Seeing , but not worth $50 by a longshot."
2,Fun but crashes like mad even WITH the first patch.,"I got this game ""free"" when I purchased an NVIDIA 8800 GTX graphics card. The game was awesome for about 2 minutes, and then the crashes begain, so I applied the patch, upgraded the drivers from NVIDIA and it's still crashing. Graphically, it ""looks great"", but playability is not there when I hit any of the ""menu options"", the screen goes black, and sooner or later, this game actually crashes the computer, not just the game itself. Hopefully it's not going to remain a pile of junk, because the online demo and the small parts of the game I've been able to play seemed really fun. I wouldn't buy this game anywhere though until the forums respond positively that the bugs are worked out of it. I have a ripping fast computer and the top of the line graphics card and it still crashes, so perhaps it's better on a baseline system, who knows."
3,Ye olde first person RPG.,"This is the first first person fantasy rpg I've played, and I've been craving such a game, so it's been hitting the spot. Rather fun overall, although less than perfect execution in some areas. It's worth noting that on the technical side, they really did leave some bugs in there. I couldn't even get the game turned on until I patched it up to current, and even then the game crashes every time you exit it. There are occasional clipping errors, but quickload solves that, uh, quickly.If you have a hankering to swing a sword, headshot with a bow, or throw fireballs, the game is cool. If you are looking for artisan quality, keep looking."
3,Dark Messiah,"It is a very fighting intense game, very good from the first person perspective, but if the developers would have build a bigger world with more personal choice it could have easily qualified as game of the year, so it is only a game with good combat, too linear to be fun and too short."
3,The best pressure cooker cookbook ever,This pressure cooker cookbook is for the old type (stove top ) pressure cooker! Not the new electronic type!Cookbook reeked of cigarettes. When I handled the book my hands smelled of cigarettes!NO MORE USED BOOKS!!!!!
3,Wide selection of recipes,This book has a wide range of recipes. The reason it wasn't given more stars is that there are no pictures. Also it is a stovetop pressure cooker book and we had to make adjustments for the electric pressure cooker.
5,If you like Settlers...,"You'll like Starfarers too. It has an adventure quality missing from Settlers where players explore their part of the universe and meet aliens who add to your private spacefleet. The only drawback we've found is that the boosters tend to break your mothership and I recommend that you leave them on the table instead of applying them to your ship... other than that, it's a lot of fun!"
1,Used in Bad Condition,"Purchased this used, was a mess when I got it, all pieces loose in box, spaceships were broken. Have always bought from Amazon.com, love it, but I will probably never buy anything used again. Quality control was awful."
4,Settlers is better....,"Starfarers is not only complicated, it's OVERLY complicated. It's also fairly shoddily put together; in half an hour of play, we broke two pieces (and not by slamming them around, either; by trying to place boosters on the ships.) That being said, it was fairly entertaining. There's not much really educational about it. Settlers of Catan is absolutely a superior game, in its ease of learning.One thing Starfarers has over Settlers? I didn't mess up the board every time I knocked into it. =)"
1,Wrong product,I also received the wrong book. The image and description of this product does not match up with the book that is sent. Very misleading. I plan to return the product and hope to get a refund.
2,nice product if it would work!,I received this as a gift for my son for Christmas. It was up on a shelf for four months. I took it down and let my son play with it. He loved it. I noticed last week it started to read the same page over and over again. Now it won't recognize any of the books. Now I have to tell my mother-in-law that she wasted her money on it. Don't waste yours on it either. I'm sure there is probably another product out there that will work better.
2,Wish it worked,"My child got this for Christmas and I loved this when it worked! Like the others, the book will no longer ""catch"" and can't be read, wish it would be recalled so we can get reimbursed! What a bummer."
3,Children bend the flimsy books making it hard to read,"My 2 year old loves this, but after awhile of normal play the books get bent and the machine won't read it right (understandable). I smashed the book under some heavy books and it fixes it somewhat, but the 2 year old gets very mad when the machine reads the wrong page. This is rated for 6m to 3 yrs - you would think they would know that the books would have to be unbendable since kids that age would do such things to flimsy books. She liked it so much in the beginning I thought I would buy more books, but now I am thinking of making it disappear since she gets so upset when the wrong pages are read."
2,Cute idea but very flawed,"I really liked the idea of this toy being able to let my kids read books on their own. However, the whole thing comes apart way too easy for little kids. Just read to them yourself and I'm sure everyone will have much more fun."
2,Good Idea but didn't work,"I bought this product twice because I really wanted to have it for my baby. Each time the reader was faulty. When I would turn the pages, it either sensed nothing, or it sensed the incorrect page (sometimes from a different book altogether), and never read correctly. I was very disappointed."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Product","I purchased this (and all the extra books) for my daughters 1st birthday. It never worked quite right from the beginning. It wouldn't read the book or would read the wrong book. It would also skip, almost like a cd would since it was having a hard time sensing the book. The books fell out easily and the reading unit itself would come apart at the ""hinge"". We tried changing the batteries and that didn't help, so after lots of frustration we went back to the store and exchanged it. It worked better at first, but now we are having the same problems we had before. I gave up. My daughter is almost 3 now and still loves books. She enjoys being able to ""read"" a book without mommy, but gets upset because it rarely works. Its a good idea, but it just doesn't work. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Poorly made,"I agree with the other reviews, its a great idea. 90% of the time the reader is asking for a book to be inserted, because the product is so poorly made, the books do not stay in the reader. If you hold the book in place, something a two or three year old is not likely to do, the book often is reading the wrong page or the wrong book!"
1,What a piece of junk!,"Just got this for Christmas from my sister for my son. First time we used it was in the car so I thought that the bouncing was the problem. NOPE. At home I tried to use it by myself. Books were curled by the way they were packaged at manufacturer and will not stay in contact with the reader and no matter of bending will correct it. In the middle of sentences while I am holding the book down it will insist that I ""insert a book"". I see by the other reviews that there are more problems to come. Yippeeeee! Wish this site would let me give it no stars."
2,Doesn't work after a couple times!,"My husband got this from a trip to USA for my 11mo baby girl. I agree with other reviewers, the idea behind the product is fine, but it is surely poorly executed. The sensors are not strong to understand and the voice reading the pages was all wrong. Also, mine stopped working suddenly and would not work again! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone - stick with the good old board books and parent's voices for the best learning for the child."
4,Outstanding Collection,"The collection of pieces and images in this book are truly breathtaking. The ability to link the art forms of music, dance, and art are essential to the understanding of Indian treasures. A wonderful book to own as a reference."
2,Too expensive & disorganized,"Perfect for the instructor that needs a quick hands-off curriculum. But for the student paying the bill, it's just another over-priced, poorly-edited excuse for generating classroom revenue. The topical outline seems to be undecided, and the depth wanders from thin to bottomless. Be prepared to hunt the entire collage for specific references. The accompanying 34 page pamphlet (disguised as a lab manual) provides deliberate overly-simplified confusion, and is often completely ignorant of the textbook. The eActivities on the CD are helpful, like other Cisco instructional aids. But I am surprised that Cisco would permit their brand name on the package. The printed material is constantly aggravating. If you have to buy it (and you know you do) get it as cheap as possible. Good luck."
3,I've read this one before,"Elizabeth Thornton can usually be counted on to deliver a well written page turner,but, somehow, this book didnt do it for me. I realize that we dont read romance for originality,but for the ""boy and girl live happily ever after"" ending. But to get to that ending I have to be more entertained than I was while reading the story of Ellie and Jack. Another reviewer gave the plot and storyline in more detail,so I'll just say that Jack was the usual ""I can't tell her how I really feel""regency lord and Ellie,while more interesting and original than Jack-she is a governess-companion who is also a gambling ""virtuoso"",has that ""I can't tell him how I feel until he sees the real me"". Nothing new here,but lord,these two bored me! I would rather wait and read about Jacks' two friends,Ash and Brand(you know these regency guys always travel in packs), who will both be having there own stories soon. Well written but,just not up to par for me."
4,Delightful Escapism,"What a nice surprise to find that along with the romance I was treated to a mystery.Yes, some of the story was predictable and a bit convenient, but it kept me reading and trying to guess whodunit. There was action which gave our hero a chance to be heroic on more than one occasion. The fact that the hero had sworn off marriage and then quickly capitulated to marriage was surprising, but he was a true gentleman and it was expected. The heroine was resourceful if a bit annoying with her doting on her immature brother.This was Ms Thornton's twelfth novel and she has written five more since writing this one. I intend to read more of her enthralling historicals, pure delightful escapism."
4,14W level is useless,"This light bulb works. However, in the 14w mode the light bulb makes a humming sound, and the light is purple. In the 19w mode, the light is warm ( a tint of yellow), and there is no humming sound. In the 32w mode, the light is yellow.I will stick to the 19w and 32w mode."
3,Successful Wine Marketing,this book I guess is quite handy for people who wants to entry wine business. It covers a lot of marketing concepts and lots examples.
1,I ordered the item thro famous watches,It came in 3 days but the watch is pretty bad. I'm just wondering what to do with it.
1,Just plan cheap,it glitches all the time i can have it on and it turns off and i didn't even touch it or vise versa. Its a hard plastic so the nub on the end can hurt sometimes
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I already have a rabbit vibrator and was hoping to use this new toy to increase pleasure DURING the act. I found it to be not very stimulating no matter how it was positioned and not at all possible to use ""during"". Slightly disappointed."
2,Clitoral Stimulation ONLY,"I didn't purchase this from Amazon but I do have it and it is not made for insertion at all, only your clitoris can get a rise out of this toy. Looking for something to replace it as we speak!"
5,"A wonderful, though not simple, book","This is a very good book. Nevertheless, readers should be warned: it is not about the HISTORY of Natural Law; it brings a THEORY on Natural Law (a theory based, mainly, in Aristotle and Aquinas). Anyone looking for a simple, historical look at Natural Law (as seems to be the case with the reviwer Ace Custodio) should look elsewhere. But those who care enough to face the dificulties of the text will be well rewarded."
4,Not for Beginners,"This interesting but difficult book lays out a comprehensive theory of moral and legal philosophy. Early chapters argue that certain forms of human flourishing (such as the good of knowledge) are self-evidently valuable; the final chapter paints a lovely picture of how ""playing"" in the ""game of God"" may be the ultimate purpose of human existence. The intervening 200+ pages of text, however, are a tedious analysis of core legal concepts such as ""obligation"" and ""rule of law."" Conceptual distinctions are laboriously identified; sentences are sometimes hundreds of words in length. The basic idea is that natural law is the law necessary to achieve the good of human beings and communities. However, only masochistic students of jurisprudence will stay interested in the entire argument. I found myself inadvertently skimming entire sub-chapters. Readers just getting started on philosophy of law really must begin with authors like H.L.A Hart or Ronald Dworkin."
2,remington book,"bad reproductions of colour ""sketches"" by the artist-sadly his best work was not present."
5,Amazing History,"A fantastic pictorial record of history, giving a flavour of the atmosphere surrounding events that complements contemporary sources and academic writing on the times."
3,had better and meatier vienna sausages,"not good right out of the can like some other brands, and not as dense as some others ['meatiness']--but throw them in a stew or sauce of some kind and when heated are pretty good. all comes down to price and for the price I can't complain."
4,Really Sad,"great documentary, but emotional and difficult. It just proves the point that we all just want to be loved, and this story is a beautiful testament to that."
4,PRETTY GOOD WESTERN ADVENTURE!,"This it the third book in The Last Warriors series. They are very well written. This one is about the life and times of Young Buffalo, a Crow warrior who is a friend to whites but still does not trust them. The Crows and the Sioux are bitter against each other. Neither one trust the other. Yound Buffalo is a young man when the book starts and he fights many battles, is a scout for the army and finally chief. He loses many friends along the way. He makes one friend in Braddock, a white soldier who has deserted from the army but makes a good fighting man among the Crows. Kosser has done well in the series. If you like stories of long ago and how the indians lived you will like these books."
4,I like it.,One of my favorite Janet albums. I always wanted this collectors edition too. This was a great addition to my collection.
2,very basic ...,This book is extremely basic. I would only recommend it for those who have very little knowledge of baseball. It spends a lot of time covering basic rules of tee ball and does not cover the fundamentals in enough detail to be of any use. If you have ever played baseball then this book is not for you.
3,its ok,"this is an okay book. i got it a yeard sale for a dollar, i ahve been reading it everynight because i always need something to read, i go crazy if i don't. well anway about the book; its ok. It talks about peoples dreams that come true and stuff and later on in the book i gives his theroy about psychic dreams. he also talks about how the dreams could a ""coincidence"". like the dream aout the robbery the guys was very detaled about it and it all came true! well anyways i give it 3 stars because of lack of telling about how they get the psychic dreams he gives some info. but not a lot. well like if you get it don't pay more then two dallors it would be a wast of your money!"
4,"Good movie, better book","If you enjoyed the movie, you're going to like the book better. There was a lot to the story that Conn was forced to edit out of the movie to shorten the running time. Once you read the book, you wish that Conn could have afforded to keep the movie the length she intended. The book also explains some things that seem disjointed in the movie. Claire's struggle to decide what exactly it is she wants in her life is interesting. Noel's reluctance to get involved with a ""straight"" woman is understandable. The story isn't as much about seduction as it it inevitability. It would be nice to have a follow up to see how this pair ended up later."
2,What came first?,I gave this book 2 stars more out of nostalgia then anything. It is chalk full of florally pros that border on the boring. I am not sure what came first the movie or the book however I found both of them to be severely lacking. The characters are hard to like especially Claire and by the end of the book I didn't much care if they got together or not.
5,"A WONDERFUL STORY, COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!",This book was like a breath of fresh air as I could see the characters in this story come to life. It was wonderful reading how the people of that time could come together to make wonderful things happen. RECOMMENDED!!RECOMMENDED!!!
3,Something Special,"Francine Michaud-Kupsch's Lady MD is a ""must read"" book. Not only does the story show determination, courage, and love but it also takes you to another time that you are less familiar with. Heartwarming, exciting and very intertaining. A book for the young and old alike. She caught the essence of the era. My hat's off to this author."
2,Simplistic but pleasant,"This book was really not worth the money spent, but it is a pleasant enough story. It is written (and edited) rather poorly, but overall has a simple theme that may resonate with readers. As a historical romance there is no research apparent, and not much plot.The characters are weak and insubstantial and I would recommend getting this title at your local library if it is available, rather than purchasing, as you will probably not want to read it more than once."
3,Good Basic Book as a starting point,"I purchased this book along with the SAS survival handbook by Wiseman, and I have to say the SAS handbook was better and more comprehensive, because the SAS book covered how to get food in the wild.But there were quite a few tips in this book that I thought made purchasing it worthwhile, and the price is less than $20, which I felt was reasonable for the information given.The author gives lots of ideas for how to cheaply increase food storage space in your home, like under your bed, and how to make or buy inexpensive shelving for large amounts of canned goods.The inventory planning chart was mostly filler pages and something I could have done with a wire-bound notebook.The checklists were good-- the author basically has long lists of all the items you should have in your home at all times."
1,Non-Survival Handbook,"I have fallen prey too often over the past couple of years to shills offering ""survival"" solutions and products to those of us less experienced in prepping for tough times. Catchy titles, glossy book covers, empty promises and pricey products. I won't reiterate the comments already posted on this 1-star review. I agree with most of them. There seems to be a number of people making a living by profiting on the naivete of the neophytes. I'm spending more time getting valuable info from free internet sites, so I don't have to spend more money on 250 page books with 20 pages of useful advice. I at least was able to take some of Ms Layton's many empty list categories and turn them into expanded, very useful Excel spreadsheets.Do many people ever read the negative review comments before buying a product? I know I didn't on this one, and should have. I would have saved some money. I won't make that mistake in the future."
5,Fun book,Another book weve really enjoyed.Like the writers style and she is well versed on her topic.Worth having in your library IMO.
3,Flipped thru the book quickly,"I've only skimmed the table of contents and flipped thru the book, but it seems to offer just what it advertised: wisdom and know-how for the survivalist. It's not rocket science, but there are ideas in there that will be helpful in any crisis management planning."
4,Goodi nformation.,I also gave this to my living off the grid pals and have decided it is not time for me to live off the grid. I will go stay with them when and if that time comes.
2,"Got it at my library, glad I didn't buy it.",I read through this book and It's definately not as in depth or insightful as I feel it could have been.It's worth skimming through but that's about it.
2,Disapointing,"I bought this book hoping to find detailed instruction and advice on practical methods for preparing foods for storage. After getting the book yesterday, I found that the book is more what you can buy and how to store it.I think that the title is misleading. It might help you buy things to prepare for an emergency, but since all the advice is how to buy, store, and some simple recipes, it wouldn't help you in a survival situation. For example, there is only a 1/4 page on dehydrating food, it tells you nothing other than you can buy nice dehydrators and to follow their instructions. There is also lots of space taken up with ""fill in the blanks"" record keeping. Not a total waste of money, but not a good book for practical food preservation advice."
3,a little disappointing,"I expected more information from this book. Where to buy and the exact amounts, rather than spread sheets I had to figure out and pencil in. There is a lot of good information, but I guess I expected more survival information and less lists."
1,Information in this book is free online,"I did not read the whole book form cover to cover, but decided to return it, after I paged through most of it. Literally everything I saw in the book, I found in more depth and with better images online. If you have done any research about food storage and emergency preparedness online, then this book will not have any new content for you. If you know how to cook simple things (boil water, etc.) then the recipes will be pretty disappointing. I really don't need anybody to tell me how to make oatmeal (oats, water, salt...boil. there, that saves one page from the book).Do not buy this book, if you possess common sense, the ability to google and print FREE lists to organize your food storage."
3,"Not as thorough as hoped, but it's a start.","If you don't know much about family preparedness and basic food storage then get this book, it is simple and will help get you started. However if you are already a fairly frugal, prepared person; most of the info it this book is already common knowledge. I would have liked to see some diy ideas on everyday supplies or waste that can be turned into cooking or heating devices..stuff like that."
3,Not for the faint-of-heart!,"The Emergency Food Storage & Survival Handbook was a bit daunting. There are good tips, some planning guides, and much information. For those of us who are almost overwhelmed by the busy-ness of day-to-day survival, caring for our elderly and handicapped, stretched too thin already, the thought of inhibiting the reproduction of bugs in stockpiled grain barrels is almost too much to contemplate. For the serious planner ... those who will emerge unscathed from their bomb shelters, good luck! Don't even bother to bury my bones, if you run across them; I'm too tired to think of starting over without plumbing!"
2,Find it cheeper,The information in this book is what you will find after about two hours of research on the net. It is nice to have it in your hand and there is a large section laid out for filling in the blanks with your info. You could just find that type of list on the web and copy it into a $.99 note book. If you can find this book on clearence somewhere and not pay more than a couple bucks It would be worth it.
4,Emergency Food Storage and Survival Handbook,"The book ""Emergency Food Storage and Survival Handbook"" is well written and easy to follow. It offers basic information for individuals new to preparing for an emergency whether it be short term or an extended crisis. The book gives sound advice and provides insight into how to store and rotate emergency provisions and even offers advice on preparation of food and several recipes.This book is great as a starting place for those just getting into ""prepping"" but may be redundant for those experienced in long term preparation."
3,Layout is weird,"Older book, seems out dated, but applications are good-i would keep something like this on file to have in emergencies"
4,Informative little book.,"This book has good info., learned a good bit even though I'm up on this subject. Recommend this book, good price."
4,"Helpful, but not quite enough","I've read this, and continue to use it as a reference. While it has a breadth of information useful for planning, what I really missed is a very detailed list of shelf-life for various foods. There are generalized numbers for general food categories, but I'd like much more. If you are truly planning for an emergency, you'll need more than just this book."
5,Better than the others I bought,Just got a chance to read the book. Love it! Simple easy to follow and practical...no so end of the world and has a pages and pages of lists for planning.
4,GREAT READ!!!,"I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to stock and actually USE their stored food. It's fairly easy to stock your cupboard with edibles, but this book shows you how to maintain and utilize your stored food. I'm ready for three months without Wal-Mart, are you?"
3,"ok, but....","If this a first food storage/prepper book for the library, its not a bad read. Basic overview material but lacking in depth info for figuring needed quantiities like I've seen elsewhere.A good common sense motivator"
3,basic start,I found the book informative but a little on the basic side. It would be good if it gave a more indepth list on individual storage times for foods.
2,missing basics,"tools and impliments are missing in this book. If indeed survival is in question will you not need such things as hunting, trapping and fishing skills and equipment . . . will you not need a firearm to protect yourself, your family and what little you are able to find and grow? It's not in this book."
2,Not a bad book but ignores thye basics,"Not a bad book but ignores the bsics. Techniques are resource intensive and more suited to ""farn life"" than the situations that m ost ""survivalists"" may find yhemselves in. provides good info but may not be what you are looking for."
1,Burn this cookbook,"I was suspicious of this woman when she wrote a food column for Vogue magazine and praised iceburg lettuce. Always willing to give someone the benefit of the doubt, I tried 4 recipes from this cookbook. They were appalling and even my dog Zeke, the most undiscriminating gourmande on the planet, wouldn't eat them.(Good dog.)"
4,A Slumming Angel,"Jon Courtney Grimwood inspires comparison with William Gibson due to his ability to develop highly intense situations and characters with real vitality. However, my first inclinations on reading redRobe were to think of Neal Stephenson and Raymond Chandler, as his characters and the world he paints make one want to explore them. redRobe moves very quickly between the slums of Mexico City and an orbital safe-zone for political refugees, each and all drawn in vivid colors with no time or space allowed for anything close to overfamiliarity. The characters involved range from a gun with AI (not to mention personality) to a dead pope. I hate to give any details, as the story and characters (note how I keep coming back to characters) are best left to unfold as Mr. Grimwood has written them. It evokes the best reaction I can imagine from any fiction, which is to make me want to read everything written by the author. I've followed Cyberpunk from it's inception, and this is some of the best."
4,"Fast, fun, Saturday reading.","The gun is a lot of fun, the world is interesting, Axl entertains. It's a Pulp Fiction type of read, with some of Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash and William Gibson's Neuromancer. While not brilliant -- and not overly deep -- It is good and deep enough, and I enjoyed it enough to buy Grimwood's other release, Remix."
4,A Tribute,"This is a tribute from Nancy Sinatra to her father who passed on in 1998. This CD features 3 songs, ""It's For My Dad"", the #1 duet ""Somethin' Stupid"", and the other duet, ""Feelin' Kinda Sunday."" Although it may not seem as not, it's still nice to collect - nothing for Sinatra fans to go crazy over."
2,"Gorgeous Watch, But Didn't Work Properly","Gorgeous watch at a great price, but unfortunately stop watch didn't work properly and would lose time. Had to return. Amazon made it easy to return and promptly refunded my purchase price, but I needed to follow up with them again to get my return shipping costs refunded (as they had promised previously)."
5,Great Water Pressure!,All I was looking for was a reasonably priced showerhead with good water pressure and a few different spray choices to replace my old one that just dribbled water. WaterPik delivered and our shower is back in business.
3,I was not as impressed..,After reading the reviews I was expecting a great shower messager.. It's not a 5 or even 4 star product and is overrated by the reviewers.. When I hooked mine up I expected to have a good water massager.. Usually when you get a good one you can hear it pulsating.. I found it to be rather weak.. Their was a complaint that it was hard to adjust to differnt settings but I didn't notice that on mine - maybe it was a manufacturing glitch.. I still may buy another one because it is cheap and we have hard water so it won't last anyway from the minerialization until I add a water softener anyway..
1,"A total rip-off, not even useful to the non-technical user","This book was a complete and total ripoff. It reads like a poor imitation of the worst IBM documentation ever produced. The CD, with additional information, is only completely available if you are using OS/2 or WIN 3.1. This book is a waste of time and money. It shouldn't be purchased. I can really only give the book 0 (zero) stars!"
2,"A mainframe-centric, pro-IBM, glorified marketing handout","I read this book carefully cover to cover and conclude it was written by IBM mainframers to sell MQSeries to middle and upper management executives whose corporations are predominantly ""big blue"" shops. There is no mention at all of Microsoft's MSMQ and almost no reference to the internet. The book uses OS/2 in almost all its charts when showing client-server configurations. It abounds with detailed references to IBM products such as CICS, IMS, DB2, MVS, etc. The case studies are watered down to the point of being almost useless. I guess this is a ""must read"" book for a serious professional who needs to learn about messaging, but it is a shallow book and extremely one-sided."
5,The Finest Collection of Johnson's Work,"ASV's Living Era collection of James P. Johnson is a masterful series of 25 solo, duo, quartet, septet and octet tracks in chronological order from 1929 to 1949 with the high audio standard of ASV recordings. The collection begins with Johnson on piano and Edddie Dougherty on drums performing Carolina Shout. On other ensemble tracks Johnson is joined by musicians including Bessie Smith, Cootie Williams, Ethel Waters, Pee Wee Russell, Red Allen, Fats Waller, Dickey Wells, J.C. Higginbotham, Sid Calett, Vic Dickenson, Ben Webster, Sidney Bechet and others. The sound is very fine and one would need to purchase quite a number of hard to find recordings to gather all these tracks. All in all, the greatest overview of Johnson's solo and small group work."
2,Not a good buy for the Palm,"I got the version of this keyboard that you can use for your Palm m100 series, and I was very unhappy with it. The plug specially designed for the m100 did not fit properly into the handheld, and then the keyboard died after a few weeks and wouldn't work at all, despite new batteries, etc. If you want a keyboard for your Palm m100, splurge and buy the Palm full-size one, or be disappointed."
1,An amazon.com mess-up!,"This item is wrongly described by amazon.com. The illustration is of a totally different item, and it is that item different item which the marketplace supplier sent. If you order the Charles Ives - Five Violin Sonatas, what you are likely to get is Beethoven - Symphonies 5 & 7.0 out of 10 for amazon.com on this occasion."
5,Fantastic old-school anime,"3x3 Eyes is one of my favorite anime series. The story is engaging and the pacing is superb. I enjoy the characters and the evolution of the primary protagonists throughout the series. If you like old-school animation, you'll love the gritty art style and fluid movement of this series - no recycled or looping animations either!The DVD transfer is less than perfect, with full-frame blending in some places, and one scene that somehow got overexposed. However, I don't feel this issues are significant enough to subtract a star - the blending is barely noticable when watching, and the overexposure is again only one scene. The image clarity isn't up to modern standards, but that's expected of an older series, and doesn't bother me in the slightest."
1,Not a good game at all,"This is not a good driving game at all. It's graphics are so bad. It's controls are hard to use. It's so hard to turn in every car even the one with best turning. It's not as good as Driver. That's a good driving game. Driver isn't a racing game, but it's so much better than Rally Cross. At least in Driver you have good graphics and easy to use controls. If you disagree than buy it. Keep your reciept so you can take it back. I also think Sony could have done a way better job considering their good reputation in electronics."
1,Read the label,"Actually, it says for ages 2-6. That would make the other review completely appropriate."
1,DOESNT WORK ON MAC OSX,"The game wont install on a Mac running OSX... Therefore, its not true that the game is Mac compatible."
3,yeah not bad....great music though,its a little known fighter that wasn't that bad....it was entertaining for awhile......but the music was excellent.....I wish they gave credit to the bands and artist who contributed to this game.....if anybidy does know.....let me know
3,Not Bad!,The game can be very fun but only for an extent i really do not say you should buy it. But renting may be a good idea.The games a short moment of fun but cherish it as it lasts!!!!!!!
3,cuts slits in dough - does NOT cut dough into strips,"I wanted something to cut dough quickly and easily into even strips which I then would weave into a lattice. That is NOT what this tool does. This tool cuts slits in the dough that alternate from line to line; the ""lattice"" is created by stretching the dough to expand the slits into openings that mimic a lattice (I uploaded a photo that shows it in action). If that's what you want, this is the tool you need."
2,Not easy to work with,"The concept is good however, execution is lacking. Dough/crust rolls up with the roller and doesn't open up as the description suggests."
5,Great Quotes,I have given this little books of inspirational quotes to many people. It is a great compulation of quotes to make your day
5,One of his best from the Nashville Marathon,"In 1970 the worlds greatest singer entered the recording studio in Nashville and put on a demonstration of raw energy and power that has stood for the ages.Elvis' mamoth recording session produced some great albums...Elvis Now,He Touched Me,Love Letters and this classic...Elvis Country.It was as unique and innovative as Elvis himself...from the cover art(Elvis' baby photo) to the use of I was Born 10,000 Years Ago in between songs as one fades into another...it is truly a classic.None of these songs sound country however.Elvis gave each work a clear distinction...Elvis made his own style of country.I embrace this album as a true classic.Play It LOUD."
5,Who says Elvis was no good in the 70s?,"Great 70s Elvis album, here with bonus tracks (although the original LP contents are arguably better enjoyed on the WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES box set where they all appear sans annoying overlapping link track).Listen to Elvis and his crack studio band tear through ""Washed My Hands In Muddy Water"", or build to a crescendo on ""Tomorrow Never Comes"". Other highlights include ""It's Your Baby"", ""Snowbird"", and the bonus tracks ""Where Did They Go Lord?"", ""It Ain't No Big Thing"" and ""If I Were You"".Great stuff. Buy this, then start saving for the forthcoming THAT'S THE WAY IT IS 3-CD box for the very best of 70s Elvis."
5,2nd best,Elvis' first album will always be the best for the reason that it was the one that opened up a new genre of music with really good songs on it. The country album snuck in under the radar but if you listen to it you will become addicted to the songs and effort and quality of the performance of the material. I highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in Elvis. I would rate it his 2nd best album or at least tied with Moody Blue for #2
3,Could have been great,"If only those bits of THAT song(10,000 Years Ago) didn't barge their way into the end of every song and then fade as the next song comes up. It's not a bad song. It's just a horribly bad idea that was executed horribly and should be digitally removed from future re-releases. Otherwise it's one of Elvis' best albums post comeback. Not quite up to the level of the Memphis recordings but close. Fortunately the bonus tracks don't suffer from the same ""concept"". Got My Mojo Working and Where Did They Go Lord are two of Elvis' all-time best."
5,Love for missions,Steve Saint shares some compelling stories regarding missionary work. This book is a wonderful read and very inspiring. We Christians need to prayerfully consider the insights in this book. Steve Saint uses scripture and the model of Paul to validate his perceptions. I highly recommend this book.
5,"A solid, well balanced and quite readable text for RS study","I was fortunate enough to attend Gareth Rees' course, for which this book was initially written. As a student that always needed to get things through the brain more than once for it to stick, I can thoroughly recommend this book. It is well written, handles the mathematical treatments with enough detail to be easy to follow (but it does assume a fairly strong undergraduate mathematical background). Excellent description of Synthetic Aperture Radar techniques and written in a style that makes it quite fresh for what is fundamentally a course text book."
1,Yuck!,"I took these for a few days, but couldn't handle the metallic taste in my mouth! I would not purchase this again."
1,"Flimy, see-through & too small","I purchased this item hoping to make an acceptable monk costume for Hallowen. Sadly, the robe is so thin as to be see-through and the sleeves look nothing like those displayed in the image, clinging to my arms and wrists as though they were a second-skin. Apparently this item was designed for anorexic twelve year-olds, because the whole thing was nearly skin-tight and hung to about knee-height on my 5' 10"" frame. Good for a child (provided that child doesn't stand in front of a light, revealing everything they're wearing underneath) but not for an adult.Additionally: I realize this is just nitpicking, but the packaging said it was part of their ""Biblical Times"" line. Western European Roman Catholic Monks (which this costume is intended to depict) post-date even the New Testament by several centuries."
2,One size fits most... broomsticks.,"I purchased several of these for a group Halloween party. With the exception of one thin woman, they were too small. The packaging says that these will fit men with up to a 44"" chest. My brother found it too tight to move comfortably, and he's only a 38. The fabric stretches a good deal, so you could squeeze a larger man into the costume, but he will look more like an overstuffed sausage than a medieval monk. If I had time, I'd return them, as it is, I'm going to have to get creative to make them work."
3,NOT THERE YET.,"THE JACKSON-5 ALBUM SKYWRITER WAS THE WORST ONE ON MOTOWN.IT ONLY SOLD 100,OOO COPIES IN 1973.IT SEEM RUSH SINCE THERE WAS ALOT PRODUERS ON HAND.SO THIS IS THE REASON Y JOE JACKSON WANTED OUT OF MOTOWN.OK SONGS BUT HITS."
3,Almost Touched The Sky,"Skywriter is the last album the band recorded in a traditional r&b style. The title track opens up the album and it's an uplifting, bouncy song. ""Hallelujah Day"" as the title suggests has a gospel vibe while ""The Boogie Man"" has a buzzing, funky sound. ""Corner Of The Sky"" is from the Motown backed Broadway show Pippin and the band delivers it in show tune fashion. ""Uppermost"" is an interesting and strong song while ""You Made Me What I Am"" closes the album out on a high note. Stevie Wonder produced a couple of songs on the album and this led the band to recording the backing vocals on his number one hit ""You Haven't Done Nothin'""."
5,It Rules!,"This song displays pure genius. They have always been so creative and artistic. Michael, the lead of them all, makes this what it is and makes all of their work unforgettable. Check this one out ASAP. You won't regret it.(...)(...)"
3,Author not equal to the task of such an extraordinary bio.,"While I find the story of Joe Carstairs fascinating, I find Summerscale's attempt at explaining this enigma falls short of the mark. I believe there must be many others with far greater experience as writers/biographers, and even some who knew Carstairs personally, who would have been better qualified to tell this story. Summerscale's naivete and general lack of knowledge about the period during which Carstairs made her mark is glaringly obvious throughout much of the book. Her attempt to write this story became an education for herself, worthwhile, but of no service to her readers. I would have appreciated more insight and less supposition. I also find her attempts to turn everything Carstairs did or made into a metaphor for self-imposed exile a bit hard to swallow. Carstairs was no recluse--she was quite the opposite; an exhibitionist extraordinaire."
2,WIld And Sexy -- Not!!!,"On paper, this book sounds fabulous. A rich, beautiful lesbian lives a scandalous life filled with excitement, traveling around the world, meeting lots of famous people, and making love to dozens of willing female partners. Imagine a Howard Stern sex epic with a sumptuous budget and a Merchant Ivoery feel!Kay Summerscale does a very professional job as a biographer. Unfortunately, the story is not that exciting. Yes, Joe Carstairs was a rich lesbian, and a rebel, but she was not in any sense a ""fun"" person. She was apparently some kind of borderline schizophrenic. All she could do to act ""manly"" was to throw screaming tantrums, smoke, spit and swear. Not an attractive personality. The whole thing with carrying the little doll around for 60 years comes across as sick, not funny or charming.Read the book for the sumptuous settings and try to imagine someone glamorous, like Gloria Holden (from the lesbian classic DRACULA'S DAUGHTER)having the same adventures, but in a fun way."
3,"An interesting and unique moment, essential for the collector only","This is a bit of an oddity. Amy Grant was awarded the Pax Christi award in 1994, and this is an album of the music that was played that night. About half of the album is quite lovely choir music. Lovely, but let's face it, you aren't buying this for the choir. Amy is in fine voice, and she sings simple versions of some of her songs. El Shaddai is good, We Believe in God was her single at the time, and it comes out well also. Ultimately, if you are looking for an unfound gem, a secret Amy Grant album, well, this is not going to do it for you. If you are an obsessive completist, then definitely pick this up. The rest of you can probably miss it."
5,Top notch artwork,"Jiro Taniguchi's art is great, I've read all these prior to Samurai Legend:The Walking ManA Distant Neighborhood, Vol. 1A Distant Neighborhood: Volume 2Hotel Harbour View (Hotel Harbor View)Really liked this historical manga, good story, nice drawings. Definitely want to see more from Taniguchi likeA Zoo In Winter"
4,Leftovers?,"This 2 CD set, whose track listing thus far on the web page refers to disk 2, is composed of good but not great songs from an important and very fine vocalist. For a showcase of her talents, one of the ""Best Of"" compilations would be a better introduction. The tracks are from previous albums on several labels (Eros, Sony, and Lyra), with the earliest from 1987 and the most recent being 2004. This means 30 representative samples from her recording history. All documentation is in Greek, but there are no notes beyond track listing and sources. Nonethess, the set is worthy to any collection and will bring much enjoyment. And, hey, 4 stars still is a good rating."
3,The Bag is Okay,This sling bag is okay for the price.My biggest problem with it is the cell phone holder. I found that the Velcro piece is a little flimsy and I don't trust it with my Iphone4. One of the reason why I like having a sling bag is be able to pull it around and access the contents with out having to take it off. Leaving my cell in the holder made me uneasy b/c I felt like if might fall out with the cheap Velcro strap.
4,Very Nice Compact Backpack,"I bought this backpack for when I travel in Europe. Thought it would come in handy to hold maps, tour guides, water, snacks, etc.The quality of the pack is good and I think the cell phone pocket on the strap will come in handy. The only negative for me is the outside zippered pocket - I wish it was a little bigger.Overall, I think this is a very good product and worth the price."
1,"Looks good, but falls apart",I bought this for my husband to take to work every day. It started failing within two weeks. Cell phone pouch ripped off and the straps wouldn't stay tight. Off to search for another option...
4,Great while it lasts,"This bag is phenomenal for the price, but after about 4-5 months of daily use, it started to show signs of heavy wear. Granted, I used the thing constantly for classes and work. But now the strap won't stay locked and the inside material is peeling off, leaving its residue on everything. For 12.50, you get what you pay for. It's a great bag providing you use it lightly or do not require it to last forever.Note: It's big enough to fit a notebook and a couple half inch binders, but anything beyond that will not fit."
1,"Good concept, very poor quality","Seemed pretty good at first, but the inside started peeling within a few weeks, and now everything that goes into the bag comes out covered with dozens of tiny pieces of the interior coating."
4,George Benson makes yet another masterpiece.,"Benson makes his newest album ""Standing Together"" a big success. On the disc there are great tunes to listen to when you're just jumping around or laying down. ""C-smooth"" is just an excellent and soothing song. Plus, ""Standing Together"" is outstanding! This is a great jazz album. Although there are those excellent tunes, some may be just songs that aren't as well as the other tunes. This album could use better songs though. Overall, it is pretty good, but I don't think it's a must-buy CD or cassette."
2,Why Only two stars???????,"How much you like this CD depends on why you like George in the first place. If you like his vocals, and his love songs, they are on here, and take up much of the album. If, like me, you prefer his instrumentals, they too are on here, and even through they are the minority, they are the reasons I enjoy this CD. Standouts are c-smooth, and poquito spanish, poquito funk, which are firing. Personally i wish george would do an instrumental cd, but maybe one day."
2,Very average,Cruise Control is the closes cut to the Old George Benson.far to much of the material he plays it safe.The That's Right Disc was Better than this one.His Vocals are alright and There's some trademark Benson Guitar Playing but overall this is Cocktail Lite from a Man who is a Legend and can do most of this by the Numbers Material in His Sleep.
4,A Travelogue to the Unknown,"I found so much interesting firsthand information about Mongolia, China, and VietNam in this interesting book and for that I am grateful to the author.I did feel, not far into the book, that she was rather impetuous in her decision to take this 5,000 mile journey and was not very well-prepared at all. Right away, trying to cross the border into Mongolia was an issue for her and something that I thought she should have found out about beforehand. She also made some serious safety mistakes, as when she was accosted by the two young men on horseback in Mongolia. She could have easily lost her life.Her writing beautifully captures the natural beauty of the lands through which she traveled and also the basic goodness of the people whom she encountered during her journey.A good reading experience."
1,Problems Problems Problem but a nice toy to have,"This thing is loaded with problems. The battery does not last very long and it does not always connect or work with the palm. If you want a nice toy to have, buy it. The battery will run out of power even when not being used. Does not really provide any enhancement to hot syncing. Has many problems connecting to wireless access points.As for me, I like toys so I brought it."
3,only the names have changed,"The issues are about the same as they were from 1990 to 2010. I don't buy the anti-gay bukwash I hear that is tiresome by now, however what he says about 90's is seemingly the same about 2010 with Obama. It is a shame that a 20 year old book can still hit the nail on the head from so long ago. Ashame."
1,NO POUCH RECEIVED,The pouch which is shown in the photograph/graph to keep the safety pins was not included with the pins - I specifically purchased this item because it looks like the pouch is included.
2,"Dull, Dull, Dull","Textbooks don't have to be this dull even when they are about a dull subject. There is not an ounce of personality to be found in this textbook. There must be a better textbook for this subject. On a good note, you'll get plenty of sleep while reading this textbook. ZZZZZzzzzzzzzz!"
1,"Strange, non-watermelon flavor","The watermelon fruit slices were not as convincing in flavor as other fruit slices that I've tried. They leave an odd, non-fruity aftertaste that just shouldn't be found in any kind of food. These went directly into the trash when I was unable to pawn them off on anybody else."
3,Hmm...something's missing....,"The books isn't half bad except for the fact that it is missing A LOT of information on the island's contemporary art. But, of course, for art history before modernism, it is an excellent resource."
3,Tezuka's Kimba The White Lion,"26 episodes from the classic animation TV-series ""Kimba The White Lion"".These are presented in good prints and the original (good) dubbing."
2,Why do I read Xanth novels? All seem the same at this point,"Nothing new, nothing interesting. I just finished reading it and it's just more of the same. I've read all of the Xanth novels and the last several all sort of blur together. Re-read ""Spell for Chameleon"" (sp?) instead."
1,One of the hardest of the series to read.,"Though the book is still fun to read, it was pretty much like the rest of the series: main character has a problem, goes to good magician, then ends up in a full fledged adventure. The trips to ida's moon is enough to make anyone loose track of where the characters were, where they came from, and what they were trying to accomplish."
4,Very Pleasing Fantasy Adventure,"I am a huge Piers Anthony fan. Faun & Games was a delightful story, but it became a bit hard to follow from moon to moon. The concept of Ida's moon is a bit more far fetched than most of Pier's story lines. All in all it was a wonderful book."
2,Hmmm...,"I've just finished reading Faun & Games and have over the years read every Xanth novel before it. I gotta say, here was a setting with a fair amount of potential. Exploring Ptero had so much possibility. A world of might-bes. Unfortunately, the author seems to have just exploited it as a means to including as many of his readers Xanthine suggestions as he could, designing a loose plot around this catalogue. Please try harder Piers I know you can do better."
3,"Not my favorite, but OK","In my opinion this is not one of the better Xanth books. It sort of drags along but some interesting and good things happen. As for those who continue to complain that there are too many puns all I can say is ""then quit reading them unless you like to be unhappy""!!!"
3,Xanth's Latest Throwaway characters out of control,"Xanth's latest suffers from the same illness of Baywatch: Too many characters to follow the series. I fell in love with Bink, Chameleon, Dor, and other characters who make rare guest appearances nowadays. Why not go back to the best-loved characters? The fantasy-within-a-fantasy world herein just strains my willing suspension of disbelief. Read the first 10 books like Castle Roogna or A Spell for Chameleon to find the real charm of the series and to find characters that weren't made of cardboard."
3,Getting better,"Faun and Games is definately a few steps up from Anthony's previous two Xanth novels in my opinion. The story is fun, the characters are new and, for the most part, unexplored. However, it seems as though with each passing novel, the series grows farther and farther in terms of storytelling and ingenuity than the earlier Xanth stories. I haven't read the latest novel Zombie Lover, but I hope it continues in the same direction F&G was headed towards.....up."
4,one of the better books by piers anthony,This book was interesting because of the parade of oddly shaped moons. I especially liked taurus and pyramid. I have read most of his xanth books and I feel that they are getting better and better even though I have liked every xanth book. I also hate the fact that it takes a year for hard covers and two for soft cover.
1,"Nice idea, poor execution","The instructions for each of the initial poses are very poor - for someone who has never done yoga it is more confusing than helpful. For example, how does one get into the ""downward facing dog pose? - all she shows is a picture of someone in the pose.She does better further into the book but I think too many people will stop after getting confused starting off and not read on.Her self testimonial about starting yoga years ago and going from a 24 handicap to a 16 is not an impressive endorsement. Any half competent athlete would be able to go from a 24 to a 12 with diligent practice in a few years"
2,Disappointing,"This book was not what I expected it to be. The photographs are small and in black and white.Golfers, save your money! Take a good Yoga class and learn the stretches on your own. Then take a few golf lessons, just for fun!"
1,No Show,"This book was a big disappointment to me as it provided very little information on how to actually do the recommended exercises. For a book of less than 200 pages, it has almost 1/3 dedicated to discussion of general yoga topics. It has a Preface, Acknowledgements, an Introduction, Theories of Yoga, Traditional Yoga vs. Yoga for Golfers - we haven't gotten to any actual instruction yet. A better choice for golfers looking for more flexibility and comfort would be Roger Fredericks DVD series."
2,Yoga for golfer,"This could be a good book just needs more information, on how to do the yoga pose and more on warm up, cool down, and their is a lot more that could have been add to the book."
1,Not Good,Incredibility cheap product. The little $10 fans you buy at walmart have a sturdier build and much more power than this little puppy. Product does not fit the price tag.
2,cheap made,"The airflow from this fan is terrible. Cant tell which way its supposed to blow. To be made by Hella, its a disgrace to the company name."
2,Skirts the Issues,"This had potential, but ultimately doesn't deliver. The authors do a fairly good round-up of how men have been consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots in advertising, and how that isn't really flying that well with male consumers. (Wow, what a surprise!) Things are indeed changing. However, they drop the ball when they attempt to come up with the hip definition of the ""new male,"" what they call the ubersexual. They spend only a paltry few pages on what they believe this new trend actually is, and clearly show they are out to lunch on the topic. Advice for the authors: talk to real men who don't work on Madison Avenue, and stop relying on yesterday's market surveys. Is this why advertisers still don't get it when it comes to men ages 18-34? Yes."
1,The lack of insight is startling,"I worked with two of the authors at their former ad agency, Euro RSCG. Given the thousands of hours they have spent in consumer focus groups, I was amazed and ultimately annoyed by how stultifying obvious many of their ""observations"" are. If a marketer actually finds this book useful, his company is in a ton of trouble."
1,Pointless,"Why must we always have to re-define men and put them into a certain category? And what purpose does it have? This book, just like the whole idea of creating new words to define men such as ""meterosexual"" and ""ubersexual"", is pointless and a lame attempt for somebody to get money and coin a silly name that won't do much of anything to how men look at themselves in general."
5,useful for anyone,I read this book years ago and have referred to it many times. This book shows how the family we grew up in affects the marriage we have now. It also gives information on real case study couples and how they worked out their differences. I have given this book to others who found it tremendously helpful and it would probably be a great wedding present!
4,The ever changing Daniel Amos,"If you had to pick a Daniel Amos album that ""typifies"" Daniel Amos, this wouldn't be it. but don't let that you stop you from buying this album. As the previous review states there is some spoken word set to music which reminds me a little bit of Lou Reed. (But then ""Get into the Bus, Aloha"" reminds me of They Might Be Giants) Daniel Amos is always willing to explore different styles and of course they pull it off beautifully with ""Songs Of The Heart"". It's not as weird as I've made it sound. D.A. is masterful when it comes to great melodies and catchy hooks and this album has plenty of them. Terry Taylor's lyrics are once again, brilliant!"
5,Awesome book,"I have underlined, highlighted, dog-eared pages. I'm in the medical field and the information in this book has been so useful. It isn't just about chakras. I can't help but talk about this book with everyone I know. I highly recommend it."
5,Great account of WW2 American Pow's,"This book is a great way to learn about the horrors that American men went through in the Philippines during World War II. It is truely remarkable that a person could live through what the author lived through, and after the war was over, come back to the states and lead a very productive life. The book would be great for anyone interested in WW2 or anyone who wants to appreciate more what our servicemen and women did for our country."
4,Old Schoolo,"This PPV was pretty cool, but the reason it was 4 stars is because of TAKER VS. HOGAN. In true old school fasiion, The Undertaker Beat Hulk Hogan to capture his 1st WWF Title. One of the Best Matches ever"
3,"So-So PPV, felt like a commercial","This PPV had so much wasted potential. The bad certainly outweighed the good. Let me start of with the GOOD. The openeing match between Piper's team and Flair's Team was excelent, except for the ending. The Hogan/Undertaker match is a historical classic that should be watched for the sake of watching it. The BAD. The final match was a waste. Sid was hurt so Macho Man was to take his place as team captain. Unfornately, the WWF decided to save him and Jake Roberts for the PPV in 6 days since they had a fued going. The result was a lackluster mainevent. Also the whole PPV felt like a comercial for the Tuesday in Texas PPV. Too little emphasis on the night at hand."
1,Taker wins the title,"Look: The first match is good, the Undertaker wins the title (only to lose it 6 days later) and lousy wrestling happens. If you're interested in the 'Taker title win, I'd recommend the ""This is my Yard"" DVD instead. The match is mercifully clipped and you Hell in the Cell '97 and the inferno match to boot."
1,A terrible product,"The first version of this radio I ordered did not work at all. The second:1) emitted a terrible humming noise whenever it was on, loud enough to be heard even when music was playing2) could not bring in the NPR station at all - it was as if the station didn't exist - which both our old GE under counter radio and new Sony under counter radio/cd player could receive3) could not play a cd with out skipping or simply freezing up.A terrible product - avoid at all costs."
4,Music for the kitchen,Bought this for the wife for Christmas. She is very pleased with the product with one exception. The player tends to have an electronic hum when it is turned on. The hum can get quite loud.
4,Finally !!,"Finally, a punk bank that perfectly balances melody and aggression. This is the answer for anyone who is sick of TV's version of punk rock but hasn't lost faith yet. I guess it's sort of a holy grail, messiah, savior kinda vibe."
3,It's an okay start,"It doesn't have everything I want in it. The log is really basic. It has three lines, one for running, one for swimming (in yards-I count in meters), and one for biking...for each day. I really would like more space to write, more guiding questions about the day (e.g. Weather, temp., time of day), a space for cross-training (e.g. elliptical, weights), space for calories in and out, weight, and space for split times. If I ran or biked twice in one day, there is only one small space for miles/time. But again, I guess since it's my first tri, it's better than writing on pieces of scratch paper as I was doing before."
3,TriLog is not international,"Handy book and quite universal in that the pages are undated, but most of the measurements are in US measurements. Quite annoying for the rest of the word - the pace charts would be wonderful if they were in km and not in miles."
5,Glory to God in Highest,Christian Decor Art Print - License Plate Tag By Tom duBios From Airstrike is beautiful and was delivered in timely manner.
3,Whre is the 4th Mode?,"This showe head is okay, you cannot get to excited over a showerhead unless it was one that played music, and talked to you in the shower. The installation was very simple, with the exception of a leak at the rotating part - missing an gasket - so don't loose any of those because the whole operation of this shower unit is at risk if you loose one - some shower heads you can slide by without them not this one! Also where is the 4th mode? Or should I say why even call it a 4th mode, you can barely tell the difference betweent he two, you have to listen for the click is the secret! This shower unit is worth the money though - I have really high water pressure and usually know right away if this going to work - and the shower head did not blow off so this is a good unit!"
5,Rare Jelly Roll Morton Piano Rolls...,"Though piano rolls sound somewhat mechanical, these Jelly Roll Morton Piano Rolls are excellent and very rare, making them essentai lfor collectors as well as Morton's fans. Recomended."
2,Haynes manual is disappointing.,"Haynes Chevrolet Impala SS and Caprice, Buick Roadmaster 1991-1996 (Haynes Manuals)was very disappointing,though it has some good basic information,it lacks specific info for the cooling and electrical systems in particular.The manual is helpful but very limited.For the price of one cent,it was a good buy."
2,Might work as a disc sander but not a balance blade.,I'll be using it as a sander but it's not truely balanced. The disc isn't true therefore it's very disappointing for a CMT.**update May 2010***I used this a lot as a sanding disc on my table saw and it works great 5 stars for a sanding disc but no stars if you need it to balance the blade to the table saw.
2,The mirrors are broken,I hadn't realized it until I received the dvd that I had seen this on Italian television and had not been that impressed. The performances are weak and the production seems stilted and very contrived. The color and sound are good but it's just not a great piece of work for anyone.
5,Great Sterio! Worth the Cost!!,"I bought this sterio for my daughter for Christmas last winter and it was the present she has used the most. She ran up to her room and plug it in a soon as she got it. It was so nice to see her so excited about a present.And trust me, I had no idea what all that gobbly gook they told me meant,until I saw it so I will translate it for you. A three C.D. changer is where it can hold three c.d.s inside of the machine at once, so that way they can put their favorite C.D.'s inside and they dont have to keep opening and closing the machine. 120 Watts just is how much power the machine has. And the sterios unattach so they can be put on a book case and the slim center can be put on a desk or table.I highly recommend this product, and it is worth every penny"
3,good overall,"I thought this was a really interesting book, but I have to admit I had a hard time following it at times. Overall, I thouht he had some very interesting things to say about redemption and grace."
1,Together: the Art of Partnered Yoga,"It has been nearly 4 weeks and I still have not received this product. I'm very frustrated. So, if you're looking to receive something that you order from this company in a timely fashion, say two weeks or less, you might want to look elsewhere. I wasn't able to submit this without rating the item. How can you rate an item you never received? Alas, I had to put 1 star just to submit this review."
2,Disco Girl From Ipanema - NOT the Original,"I bought this download MP3 thinking it was the long version with the Portugeuse dude et al, and it is NOT. It's the disco re-mix version. Disappointed, but it was only a buck. I then downloaded the correct version. Easily misleading if you don't listen to the sample."
4,"Soft, Lovely, Sensuous Sounds from Rio.","Astrud Gilberto and her former husband Carlos Antonio Jobim brought the Bossa Nova to the States more than 50 years ago. I can still vividly recall hearing them perform in a little cafe at the Hotel Piaf in Rio de Janiero in 1963 and falling in love with the delightful, sensuous sound. This enchanting album awakened this wonderful musical figure and, listening to this album while visiting Rio last year, it made me feel soooo good! Enjoy."
1,"This DVD will be your ""Favourite Worst Nightmare""","Do not waste your money. I bought this DVD for my 16 yr-old daughter, who's an avid Arctic Monkeys fan, and we were both disappointed. None of the Arctic Monkey artists were interviewed, even though this DVD was advertised as ""Behind the Music"" by Arctic Monkeys. The three 'interviewees' consistently called the band ""The Arctic Monkeys"" when we all know there's no ""The"" in front of their name and no original songs were even played. I'm sure this is because Arctic Monkeys would never agree to have their songs or reputation harmed by such nonsense. To make matters worse, there were only 10 pics in the ""Image Gallery."" The only redeemable feature of this DVD is the booklet that was part of the package, which actually included the correct names of the songs & material, that any fan would know!"
2,Kind of Lame,"I was disappointed by this. I'm a big arctic monkeys fan, but the video was boring and didn't really have too many interesting facts. Book was worthless. You're better off buying the At the Apollo DVD, which is a good concert."
3,On VH1 You'll Never see!,"Looks like it was done in someone's basement. But,... since I never get out of my apartment, nor watch MTV or VH1 or whatever other music television shows there are now, (I wouldn't know), I was pleased to find out some information on the band that I didn't already know. So, if yer into anything like that regarding the Arctic Monkeys, then it's worth your money, otherwise,... no interviews or live music on this one.Strictly comments by critics and cheap history."
5,"Amazing illustrations, beautiful text...younger kids too!","My two year old adores birds, and of all of our bird books, this is one of his absolute favorites. I'm not sure how much of the text he understands, but the illustrations, done in clay art, are beautiful, and he loves to identify the various species.I don't mind reading it over and over because the poetic text stands up to intense rereadings and I love the cadence and rhythm of the text. The author has managed to emulate the careening freedom of flight by the flitting, dipping, racing style of her poetry. This is one of those books I wish we had in hardcover."
3,Have you seen birds-book,"Fabulous story but poor condition of the book. The seller should have said it was in fair not good condition, if I had known the condition of it, I would not have purchased it. It did arrive promptly."
4,"Great sound, but poor design","I bought these headphones after returning a pair of Sony MDR-V300's that were painfully tight on my head. These HP430's are looser-too loose, really. They are also ""behind the ear"" headphones, so if you are in an area affected by gravity, i.e. Earth, you may be constantly pulling these back onto your head after they slip.Aside from the poor fit, they are wonderful headphones. They sound crisp and clear, even at high volumes, and have accuratre bass response. Unlike many headphones, they also have a shorter cord, at approx. 5-6ft., with another extension cord of equal length included. For $25, they are an excellent, but imperfect, set of headphones."
4,Food Science,"This book was nominated for the referencebook for my Masters of Food Science and technology to the ""Principles of food science"" subject/course. Contents of this book is very informative and useful for a beginner in food science. It helped me lot to get a good grade of my course work."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This CD is a 2-CD set -- the Perry Como CD is identical to ""Perry Como Sings Merry Christmas"" -- the packager just put a cardboard wrapper around that CD and ""The New Andy Williams Christmas Album"". But, without a listing of the songs on the website, you won't know that until the package walks in the door. The Andy Williams CD ""features highlights from the 1993 Christmas concert that also aired as a PBS-TV special"" -- complete with distracting patter and background noise."
3,2 discs version,"questa edizione, o almeno, quella che ho ricevuto presenta 2 dvd9con TRE versioni differentidurata 1:38,14 formato 16/9 pellicola molto rovinata disc 1durata 1:38,23 formato 4/3 pellicola ottima disc 1durata 1:38.09 formato 16/9 pellicola un pò rovinata disc 2la cosa che mi lascia perplesso èla definizione HiDef master, in era blu ray, usare certi termini, non è propriamente adatto xDe poi, perchè mettere tutte queste versioni, sopratuttto la prima, la trovo del tutto inutile, visto e considerato che la pellicola è decisamente rovinata, e che con tutti i vari bonus la compressione, sarà piuttosto forte!avrei preferito meno versioni e meno compressione.altri giudizzi quando avrò visionato per intero i dvd."
2,Kinda flimsy,"Be warned, the material isnt canvas, its more like a polyester blend. So it gets frayed easily.After 4 months the zipper fly right off. Maybe good for little kids or packing light stuff but it cant handle the rough stuff. At all"
4,Great for day travel,"I bought this bag because it weighs practically nothing, and can be rolled up and put into a larger bag. I use it mostly for day trips, where I might want to carry my jacket, a sandwich, and whatever I buy in the city. I've used it for a few months now, and it seems to be holding up okay, but do not expect a highly durable bag that will last you years and years. I feel that for the price, you can't really go wrong with this bag. It's fairly stylish, ,too."
2,K-Cliffs Meesnger Backpack,Love the over the shoulder part. NOT crazy about the fact that 3 weeks after opening the package (and leaving it outside for a week to air out) it still smells strongly of chemicals. Should have spent a few more bucks for a less toxic product.
3,not bad,overall i liked the bag. it was comfortable and held everything i needed. i purchased the bag for a trip to ireland. i wanted a bag that i could hide my cameras in so that i wouldn't look so much like a tourist. there wasn't any padding against my back and the strap kept slipping and coming unlatched. eventually i figured that if i clipped the strap slightly off center that it would pinch shut. problem fixed. it's totally worth it for the price.
4,Quality - one quirk,"The bag is quality, beyond the price, the front zipper and main zipper compartments are holding up well, the only thing is, from the beginning, the clamp that is used to adjust the shoulder strap is loose, if it gets to the end it catches, and if you press hard on it, it will stay in place, but this just seems like poor designing, otherwise a great backpack, very comfortable :)."
5,Very funny!,"Very funny gift idea. Set contains several different cat breeds, all presented from that special angle. Why does the sight of a cat's butt anger women so much? I can't say for sure but this funny little reminder was a delight for the children as they snickered and shrieked at the sight.Very affordable and also functional!"
4,Good Speakers Over Priced new,"I got these speakers over 4 years ago second hand (still in box and I doubt they had ever been used) on ebay for just 60.I had read a few reviews at the time that suggested they tended to overheat, and switch off or go pop. I have always used a Belkin Surge protector with these speaker (except rear speakers) and mine have been excellent.They are good but not worth the price new, if I were buying new no question it would have been the Logitech Z-5500"
2,Terrible if you're returning to the profession,I am returning to the profession after an absence. My letters are outdated as are my work samples. I never created a portfolio (that's a new thing) so I don't have one. There are gaps in my resume. This book didn't get me any advice about how to deal with these problems because it's totally geared to the new teacher. I was pretty disappointed with this book.
3,Outdated,"This book was helpful, but is slightly dated. It proclaims that there is a shortage of teachers, and that is far from the truth in my area (St. Louis metro). In addition, it was written before most school districts implemented online applications, so it doesn't address paperless issues. Overall, the most valuable aspects of this book are the potential interview questions and the cover letter and resume examples."
3,A useful but flawed book,"This book contains generally good advice on finding a job as an educator. But it is lacking in some respects. For example, on page 188, there is a section on overseas employment resources. There is a typographical error stating there are five resources, but only four are listed. One of the four, TIE, requires a paid subscription and many of its listings are out-of-date or nonexisting.On page 159, it cautions teachers not to blame students for their failure to succeed and reminds teachers that one of their responsibilities is to motivate the learners. This is just an approbation of the inane--and widely held view--that teachers are solely responsible for students' learning. Never mind that typical students study less and less and spend more time sending text messages than preparing for exams."
1,Not so great...,"If you know ANYTHING about a job search, you've pretty much covered the material in this book before even opening it. This book was the least helpful in my teaching job search. Yes, it talks about where to look for jobs, but I knew that already! Yes, it gives you sample resumes and cover letters, so what? You can google any of that stuff in, and save your money. Yes, it gives you sample interview questions...that's the only valuable thing about it. So it only deserves one star"
4,Entire live album should have been included,"A&M included the three studio albums, which is great, but they should have also included the entire live album instead of just two cuts. What were they thinking?"
4,An Old Fan,"I have wanted some Hot Burritos since the CD concept came into being. Chris Hillman and Gram Parsons are my favorites. I have owned three Flying Burritos LPs since my tour overseas. What a drag that Gram is no longer with us. I'm still not over it. I recently read some things about Chris Hillman at Jorma Kaukonen's Fur Peace Ranch. One can only imagine the insights we would get from Gram Parsons now. Anyway I love these guys and the songs they recorded. They put a few people on their ears with ""Too Country for Rock'n Roll"" and ""Not Straight Enough For Country"". ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" got me going down that path and that introduced me to Gram and Emmylou Harris. I will always maintain that she has the voice of an angel. The double CD is worth it if you are a fan of any of the band members."
4,3/4 of a hot burrito,"If you dont own THE GILDED PALACE OF SIN and BURRITO DELUXE this would be a good one to get,because they are both on the first disc.Disc two isnt that great, the first seven songs are worth owning only because GRAM PARSONS is on them.Six of these songs are on the FARTHER ALONG cd. the only one that isnt is TONIGHT THE BOTTLE LET ME DOWN.If your a big fan the sound is a little better than some of cds that are not remastered"
3,Hit and Miss,"I love Chris Hillman and Gram Parsons, but I always found Flying Burrito brothers a mixed bag. But enough really great tunes to justify skipping through the bad ones."
4,Hot Burritos! The Flying Burrito Bros. Anthology 1969-1972,Came when promised & in excellent condition.
1,A one trick pony,"[....] Well, ""Christine's Tune"" is pretty nifty. Jaunty and upbeat with a great fuzz drenched solo in the bridge. The rest of this is a let down. Gram has been sanctified since his early death, but there's nothing to really justify his reputation. The tunes are usually the same tempo, crawling along at a snail's pace.Further, Parsons' vocals are very weak compared with country greats like George Jones. Lastly, the Burritos are responsible for a great range of ills since their debut i.e. influencing such insipid acts as the Eagles to Wilco.The concept of the Burritos was defenitely interesting as mentioned earlier- hallucinatory country music. Junior Brown's ""Sugarfoot Rag"" fills that need.The Burritos are hippy country, something for those who can't take their Merle Travis or Roy Acuff straight."
1,Flying Burrito Bros 69 - 71,"A time capsule - Some of it is average - not up to Eagles standards, but there are some real gems here as well, which compete strongly with Eagles etc. Not quite as formed as Poco, but from the same general melting pot of musical development.If youre interested in the development of Americana from that period - it's a must - a real ingredient."
4,Disc 1 Is Essential for any Collection,"Amazingly, The Burritos debut masterpiece- Gilded Palace of Sin, is not available on CD, nor is the equally fine followup-Burrito Deluxe. This 2 CD set corrects that. Disc 1 includes both of these albums in their entirety. Disc 2 is more scattershot. Cover versions and the departure of Gram Parsons from track 8 forward make this part of the anthology less essential listening. A&M has kept their single disc anthology - Farther Along in print but it's missing 2 songs from ""Gilded"". For a few bucks more you get better liner notes, better sound and one of the greatest Country-Rock albums ever in Gilded Palace of Sin, in full."
2,Like a Mustache on the Mona Lisa,"Don't get me wrong -- I love the FBB and ""The Gilded Palace of Sin"" is probably my favorite album of all time, but the sound on this compilation is absolutely horrid. I can only hope that the hack who was in charge of the remastering has a trial pending --if so, I'll gladly be a witness for the prosecution. Granted, these songs were never lushly produced in the first place (and that's always been part of their weird, otherwordly charm), but the sound on this release has been so artlessly altered that the feel of the original recordings is simply no longer present. On speakers it's not quite as noticable, but on headphones it's a nauseating nightmare. Do yourself a favor and stick with your original vinyl copies of these tunes and avoid this disgusting, mutant beast like the plague. (I can think of one good thing to say about this release: it contains the catchy, semi-rare single ""The Train Song"", which was previously quite hard to come by....)."
4,"Great product, not quite as described","I purchased this mala as a present for my husband. He was very pleased. It seems to be of good quality, but the beads were a very dark brown, not black. The mala is too big to wear around his wrist (he is not a tiny man), but looks nice as a necklace. The etchings on the beads are also quite lovely. Overall, even with the discrepancy in color, we would purchase another mala of this type again. It was a great deal for the price and again, we are very satisfied."
4,I didn't really Exactly,"I didn't really Exactly what is in the picture but something similar,.. at first is rough hard to bend but with the time gets around the hand nicely -- for looks its ok i like it ."
5,way worth the price,"the beads came just in time, and they have to be the best Mala beads i have ever bought. i would easily pay 30 bucks for this item because of the great quality. i am a very happy customer"
5,"Very comfortable, great fit","I gave these slippers as a gift. They were well received, fit perfectly and worn the rest of the day."
1,Floppy Feet,"Comfy and cozy for the first 30 days then the heel started to breakdown. It became increasingly impossible to keep the slippers on. This meant pulling the slipper back on like an errant sock every few minutes. If I just stayed in a Lazy-Boy all morning or evening the boot is warm and comfortable, but it isn't a walk around sort of boot."
1,cute little webcam,I was never able to get it to work I worked with the company still hasn't worked for me
3,Nikon gives you one with an SB-800,Kind of a weird concept since all battery packs both disposable and rechargeable come in four packs. Don't buy unless you lose yours as Nikon includes one with an SB-800. (They do not work with the SB-600.)
1,Don't bother,"Please learn from my mistake. Unfortunately, this item is mislabeled as a ""quick recycling battery pack"" when it is only an empty battery ""container"", i.e., a plastic box that houses a single AA cell (that you must generously provide) to increase the recycling capacity of the SB-800 slightly. But Nikon already furnishes such a box with every new SB-800, so unlike true rechargeable battery ""packs"", this one is neither a ""Battery Pack"" nor remotely ""Quick Recycling"". Accordingly, don't consider buying it unless you have lost or damaged the one already included the SB-800."
5,Comes with SB-800 but...,"You'll need it when you either lose it or it is broken. Mine had some battery leaked and corroded all the terminals which is why I have to buy a new one. If you dont plan to use this for a while, take the batteries out since batteries do leakage can cause corrosion damage..."
5,Delightful Characters,"Delightful characters and situations make this book laugh out loud funny at times. Persy, short for Mary Persistence, works as a dog walker at a posh hotel. Jordan Prince, hotel owner and manager, finds the unpredictable, free spirited Persy, a complete enigma -- one he is determined to figure out."
5,Another Fun Read from Perrine,"Author Jane Myers Perrine goes contemporary this time in this delightful love story. As in her regency, The Mad Herringtons, the characters in Persy and the Prince are a little offbeat and yet thoroughly believeable. Persy, short for Persistence, has shunned the life of the idle rich to work for community betterment. To make a living she walks dogs and does other manual labor jobs at a posh hotel. Surely the very rich, very proper, owner/manager of the hotel, Jordan Prince, is not her Prince Charming. Or is he?"
5,Happy music!!,This is a wonderful album...Happy music indeed. It will get your feet tapping and lift your spirits!!I recommend it highly.
5,The Truth,"It is sad to know that kind, caring, compassionate nurses like David are the exception when they should be the rule. It is heartbreaking to know that a book like this is even necessary. I applaud all of Mr. Sampley's efforts to make changes in the nursing home system. Once I started reading this book I did not put it down until the final word was read. If you ever contemplate putting a relative in a nursing home, read this book first."
3,"Nice chrome tip, rust very fast!","Nice chrome tip, my muffler to my car is really messed up, so I just put this on to make it look like my muffler was brand new! But it rusted in the inside real fast!"
5,Amazing!,I bought this for my preschool class because we had a few peep dvds that we watch. The children just LOVE LOVE peep and the big wide world! :)
4,The Misadventures of Parker,"Unlike the linear ""Slayground,"" the previous volume in the Parker series, Plunder Squad's all over the map. The first half of the book almost reads like a few short stories, linked by Parker's on-going search for someone who tried to kill him. We follow along as Parker goes from one botched job to the next, all the while waiting for any information that will bring him closer to his target.Once that thread's taken care of, the second half of the book kicks in, and here Parker almost becomes a secondary character. We meet and follow his associates in an art heist, one which starts off fairly well but goes downhill fast. The mob gets involved, and Parker has to figure out a way to get out with both some money and his life.A quick, enjoyable read, but more of a dark comedy than a crime caper. Doesn't have nearly as much action as ""Slayground,"" but then again it has a more dynamic narrative."
1,Not readable.,"What IS this thing? It's certainly not Joly's classic manual of quaternions. It appears to be scanned into some kind of very inaccurate text reader and printed back out, with many many errors. The result is complete gibberish, and my advice to anyone is to steer far clear of it."
2,A Happy Hour of good stuff but its an 88 minute movie,"What if one brand of beer became addictive because of a new taste additive? Marshal beer has become so, against this compulsive background of swilling are hilarous commercials, a secretary (Tawny Kitaen)with many talents (belching, holding her breath underwater, but alas not typing!),Jamie Farr as Crummy Fred - a screwball detective/jack of all trades who amuses himself by using a scoped pellet gun on girls playing beach vollyball among his other fun activities of mayhem...And Rich Little as a james bond type operative. I cain't call it a good movie, but it has several fun parts."
5,These Doll pumps are dolls!,"Very cute, unique and comfortable. Fully padded inside, currant color is really gorgeous, slimming on the legs. Really attractive, GREAT PRICE!! A+++++"
5,A small price to pay for happy thoughts and warm remembrance,"If you grew up watching the televised Charlie Brown specials as I did, then you'll be thoroughly enchanted as this adorable musical compilation whisks you back to those innocent years. The only thing that would make it more complete would be the voice-over, ""Brought to you by the bakers of Dolly Madison donuts and cakes."" I smile every time I listen to it. Thank you, David Benoit."
5,Here 's To You Charlie Brown,It is great! I love it to death! LOL....I could not be more satisfied than I am with this product...Its the best Christmas CD ever.
4,"If I only could play like ""Vince Guaraldi""","Although I rated this only 4 stars instead of 5 stars,it is for artistry only in the since that David Benoit is in a class on his own. He has his own style. This album proves the point that his own style comes forth. But, if you want a more original version as a tribute to Vince Guaraldi, take a listen to George Winston version CD called Linus & Lucy - The Music of Vince Guaraldi. Winston has stayed true to the original form of the music written by Vince Guaraldi, which is a light classical jazz feel. Don't get me wrong I like David Benoit, but my favorite work he has done is on the cd titled, ""Professional Dreamer"". I think it is nice that he wanted to show his appreciation of the music behind Charlie Brown, but it would of been better to stay true to the form of the artist himself who now is a legend missed by all, if I only could play like ""Vince Guaraldi""."
2,disappointed,"my children are big fans of the ""peanuts"" music of vince guaraldi. i've tried several ""cover"" albums (george winston's, now this one) and my advice is stick to the original. there's no comparison. i am also a big fan of david benoit. my advice would be skip this CD and pick up ""remembering christmas"". it is a much better effort."
1,Too Modern,"I disliked this album very much. I thought that David Benoit sounded like a very skilled musician but changing Vince Guaraldi's music kind of ruined the value of the music. I love Charlie Brown comics and music and though I'm not very old I have read the comics, listened to the music and watched the movies my whole life. I am going to start collecting Schultz comics, music and such and thought i should say that Benoit's modern sound made me dislike this CD. If any other Schultz/ Guaraldi fans would like a good Cd Try George Winston's, ""Linus and Lucy, The Music of Vince Guaraldi."""
4,Nice curling iron,"I purchased this iron to match the hairdryer that I bought. I really like the look of it and the controls, esp the variable heat settings. My only complaint/issue is that my hair slips out of it, it doesn't want to grip my hair well. I have fine but thick straight blonde hair. I still use it though, just had to develop a technique in order to keep my hair in it when I use it. After it's turned a couple turns there's no problem."
2,"Too often, the word isn't in there.","I'm not an English major, but far too often the word I'm looking for is not in this dictionary. I was watching TV with my son, and the word, ""grifter"" came up. My son asked what it meant. I tried to provide him my understanding of its meaning. Then, we grabbed this dictionary to confirm my understanding. ""Grifter"" is not in the dictionary. I would estimate that at least a third of the words that I look up, are not in this dictionary."
5,awsome bike,any occ fan would love this bike. I love the black widow theme bike. It looks just like the real thing
3,ok.,"The book was clean, but there are many many ligh light, and there is lack of DVD with the text book. It has been better if the saler would have noticed it."
2,I was disappointed...,"I had a great Kodak Easyshare camera that drowned in an unfortunate water bottle leaking incident, and I replaced it with this. I have been pretty disappointed in the quality of indoor pictures. My last Kodak camera had a much stronger flash for the same price. They were almost the same model, but this one had a couple more MP. My indoor pictures stink because this camera has such a weak flash. My sister-in-law's tiny Canon takes much better indoor pictures than this does. I would keep looking..."
4,GREAT,"Gift for my Granddaughter, great little point and shoot. as others have said, not the best flash for dark pics, but good camera for the price."
3,very weak indoor/low light performer (pics and video),"I guess for the price it is okay, but there are some definite problems with this camera. First, in my use so far it is almost unusable indoors; the camera needs A LOT of light to be able to focus, and indoors (even with several lights on) it often won't focus (and if you try to take the picture anyway, it will tell you it is too blurry, meaning you won't be able to make a good 4x6 print out of it). The video functionality also suffers in low light --- it is okay outdoors in bright light, but videos taken indoors are very dark and can hardly be seen. In sum, for bright outdoors shots and videos it is okay, but it doesn't work well indoors."
2,Dead Kodak 743!,"I bought a 743 for the wife for Christmas. I had a 6330 that I was very happy with. So a 743 should be better Right? Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least."
3,Good for the price,"I have to say that this camera deliver what I expected, especially for the price. It takes good pictures, the qualities are good. Can't complain about a thing. After all, you get what you pay for."
1,Will not turn on reliably,"Like some other users, we have found that the camera decides on its own whether to turn on or not. No amount of battery changing, cleaning, will get it to turn on every time. If it does turn on, we tried turning it off and right back on- won;t turn on again. But, if someone just keep turning it on and off, it will eventuallyt turn on once in awhile.Absolutely unreliable."
1,Disappointed,"Huge problems with the LCD screen, two cameras within one month after purchase showed the LCD ""shattered."" One has already been shipped for service and the other one will be going in tomorrow. Sure it is easy to use and produces great pictures, but the LCD problem is a definite negative."
2,what happened....,"wow. we've had a few other kodak cameras, and i had hoped this would be a nice upgrade. it is the worst camera i've ever had. the christmas photos today were out of focus, grainy, and had weird vertical lines all through them. the video was ok, but still not as good as the ls753 that i am going to revert to. sending this one back asap."
3,"Quality Good, extremely low battery life","I'm very happy with the camera itself and the quality of pictures it takes. The worst problem is that the batteries only last a very short amount of time. I've taken the camera to 2 different events that lasted about 3 hours each and both times the batteries died. Keep in mind that I don't use the live view on the camera because I know how much more that kills the batteries. If I still had the box the camera came in, I would most likely return it."
3,Great camera BUT not durable,"The camera works great... when it works.... for the price, the feature are very good... high quality prints & the video capture with sound is fantastic since you can take video up to the size of your SD card. On the down side the camera is not very durable. The LCD is easliy broken, as is the lens, a lot seem to experiance an error message when trying to open it... I've also had the battery cover break... not break off, the cover cracked in half & part of the plastic fell off...."
4,Very satisified,"I've had this camera for a number of years and like it quite a bit. The camera uses two AA batteries and I use rechargeable NiMH batteries and always carry an extra set. Battery life is excellent and I love cameras that use AA batteries since they are so easy to keep charged and give you unlimited shooting time. I do find some batteries stop working and I attribute this to older batteries which I just trade out. Once replaced, the camera works fine. I separate these batteries to use in other devices. If you shoot photos outdoors at dusk or on a cloudy day (or in shadows), turn off the automatic flash and you will get better photos. The flash will actually darken your photos under these conditions. The overall photo quality is pretty good. I believe this is a good, reliable camera for general use and to take on vacation."
2,"Okay camera, poor quality","Camera stopped working after about 9 months with average picture taking. Printer works great,just uses up printer cartridge quick."
3,ok,"I've had this camera for a couple years now. I'm looking for a new camera because it recently just broke. It turns on once with new lithium batteries but then dies immediately. It was great when I first bought it because its inexpensive and it takes great picture outdoors during the daytime. However, when you use the camera indoors or at night the picture come out dark and fuzzy. Theres a night time setting but you need to be super still. Also, it eats up regular batteries. You need to buy lithium batteries for the camera."
5,great little camera,"I wanted a small easy to use, inexpensive camera that I can keep with me. I have a couple of other digital cameras that are very nice but a bit too bulky for carrying everywhere. This camera takes very nice, crisp pictures and I am very happy with it. It is very easy to use, the controls are placed perfectly for me. My other cameras have a lot more manual adjustments but I didn't want that this time. I wanted something very simple to use, mostly point and shoot with different scene options. I first bought it on HSN with a printer but the printer didn't work so I had to send it back. I really like the camera though so I bought it here at Amazon. Before I found this one, I had tried a Pentax 7 megapixel camera but the pictures were not as sharp as I wanted. I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants a nice little camera that takes great pictures. It is so easy to use, even a novice ould easily master it, right out of the box."
2,Disappointed,"This was a great camera while it was working, and I have always trusted the Kodak brand. Sadly, my camera just stopped after 9 months. Yes, I tried new batteries, but that was not the answer. I talked to a few other people about the same model, and they also had this problem. I will never buy an Easyshare again."
3,Nice,Its pretty good. The only thing that it will eat thru the batteries so make sure you get some rechargables made for digital cameras. They work the best. The 3x zoom is cool and when you take a pic you can zoom up to 8x however there are products out there for the same price with a 12x(panasonic) Kodak is a good product though with easy software to use. Real simple to share photos and set up albums. I would recommend it and I've looked and looked before I bought
1,Garbage,"I loved my old Kodak, so I thought that this would be a good replacement. WRONG! It drained batteries from the word go. It doesn't matter what kind of battery I use either. If I leave a battery in overnight, it is dead by morning. I shouldn't have to remove the battery after every use. And part of the reason I chose this model was because it takes video, but if I take a 2 minute video with a new battery, it drains the battery to the point that I can't take another picture. I am sending it in to be repaired, but the service tech from India said that if there is ""any evidence of damage"" my warranty is void. I told him that the battery cover is cracked from constantly opening and closing it, but that the camera has never been dropped and lives in a camera case. When I asked if I should be concerned that they might void the warranty because of the cracked battery door he only repeated the threat about damage evidence. Now I'm paranoid that they won't uphold the warranty."
2,Camera we had was unrelible,Returned this camera after two weeks would not work for my husband one day. Then worked next time we tried it. A few days later it would not work again. Tried new batteries & still did not work.
4,After You'd Gone,I was hooked from the start wanting to know more. I enjoyed the way the story unfolded giving the reader little insights of past events and their impact on the future. Some were predictable and others surprising. An easy enjoyable read.
5,A fantastic choice for a bookclub!,"This novel has definately made my list of new favorites. A fantastic piece of writing, the author's got a uncanny ability to evoke emotion like few I have ever read. If you have ever been deep in the throws of love, or had your heart broken, Ms. O'Farrell's writing will touch you deeply. This is not a happy story, but it is a superb one and ultimately redeeming on many levels. Books this good are rare, you will not be disappointed."
5,A wonderful read - and I'm very fussy!,"I can't believe this book had been around for almost a decade before I chanced upon it, and what a find. In fact, I only bought it at the urging of my local bookseller, who knows how impossible I am to please and who offered me my money back if I didn't like it! (I suspect she knew it was a safe bet.) O'Farrell's often perfect prose is clean, uncluttered, hypnotic at times, and her story of Alice Raikes a gripping one. Not a fan of genre fiction, especially romance, I found the beauty and intensity of the central love story utterly compelling. This novel was very hard to put down -- one of those 'cruel' reads you can't wait to finish and yet pine for once you have. I've heard Ms O'Farrell's other novels suffer by comparison to this, her debut, which is hardly surprising, as After You'd Gone is one of those little books that is quietly and simply sensational."
4,Remarkable,"Initially, I found this book somewhat difficult to follow. The time lines shift, as do the characters' ages and interactions. I am so very glad that I stayed with it to the point where I couldn't put it down. Maggie O'Farrell did an excellent job of developing the relationships to the point where they all converged. Alice's grief is palpable when John dies, and I did find myself sobbing at the portrayal of her very raw, real pain. I think that people who have experienced the loss of someone irreplacable in their hearts and lives will recognize and empathize with that degree of pain. Unlike some other reviewers, I felt that the ending was superb. To read about her rising to the surface of unconsciousness due to the long overdue presence of her father-in-law is a perfect way to conclude this novel. We are left, I think, knowing that her heart will mend with his help and their shared memories of the man they both loved so much will provide mutual solace."
3,a good read,"This book by O'farrell is a very unusual book. Not everything is nice and upbeat in this novel. Tragic events have occurred and afect the characters long after. A good read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
3,3 and half stars,This was a pretty emotional read. It was great at some parts and slow at others. If your looking for a book that's pretty deep and will take you a while to absorb then I recommend it.
5,A book that stays with you,"I just finished this book on Friday and it is still with me three days later. To me, that is the sign of a truly good story. And the story of John and Alice was a beautiful love story. Every aspect of this book, flipping from past to present, from John and Alice to Ann and Ben (Alice's parents)draws the reader that much more into the story. I have to say I wanted more from the ending. I needed confirmation from the author that what I think was happening was actually happening. This is not a book where you can flip to the ending to find out what happens or expect all the loose ends to be tied up.This is going to be my #1 recommended book for the next while. Well done!"
4,Would highly recommend this British Fiction,"This was a wonderful book. I am thankful that I took notes throughout because the story lines switch back & forth from past to present so keep that in mind. The notes were helpful to me but may not be necessary for the more experienced reader.It was a beautiful story of love, family secrets, and secrets revealed. I thought the characters were developed well.The book included a side story that Dr. Coleman had custody of daughter Melanie & his wife lived with his best friend. Didn't think this had anything to do with the story however. The ending could have been developed a bit more. I felt it left me hanging somehow. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the book & look forward to future books by this talented author."
3,"Great book, but not for instructing.","An excellant book for someone riding jumping, but not for someone to teach it. An instructor should go to school for training, not buy a book and read it. And while this book had great techniques, no one can learn to instruct by just reading a book. Anyone who is currently taking riding lessons, or thinking about it, read this book, you'll definatly get something out of it, especially if your trainer is ripping you off."
3,"Confortable, noise reduction and cheap","I was looking for a decent noise cancelling headphones, but there are expensive; then I found it, a nice and cheap headphone I could use everywhere, even in the noisy NY subway, and still I have a good and clear sound, specially when I need to listen my College lectures from my voice recorder.I definitely recommend this product."
5,Steve Perry step hypnotic 2004..!,Don't you worry now. Don't you worry now!! Spit it up! eah it's the poi-zon.
3,A Decent Game,"A very decent game for the Playstation. Easy game-play/controlls.Decent storyline/plot. One Downside I found on the game was an inability to save the game, in order to record my progress.Overall: It's for Playstation so don't expect much."
4,A Film With A Heart For The Unloved!,"A Man Called Norman is a story about a man who everyone is afraid of. He's the weird neighbor that everyones shuns, because he doesn't act like the rest of society. Norman represents the folks in our world who require more than the simple hi and hello, who can't do for themselves. We all are in a rush in this world, and oftentimes don't have time for individuals who are slower, maybe not as clean, that you don't have anything in common, and it requires work to get to know them. Many people like Norman are lonely people needing a real friend to reach out to them. This is the story about a guy who works through his own shortcomings to become a friend to Norman. It is an inspiring film."
2,Uneven sound,During the first seven minutes of the video the amplitude of the sound was VERY uneven making enjoyment of the film hard to achieve.The story itself is timely and much needed in today's society and we would have enjoyed it much better if the sound was consistant.
2,confusing for the total beginner,"I would not recommend this book for beginners as the instructions are not the clearest. I crocheted as a child (my mother taught me)and decided to pick it up again recently. The photographs are rather pleasant, but again the instructions are not structured well. Especially in the ""stitch library"", I had to follow my instincts and do the work, then re-read the instructions and finally realized what she meant. A good book, but I can't see an average beginner who had never crocheted before starting off well with this book."
3,"Helpful, but still confusing to total beginners","I am a total beginner and I made the mittens listed in the book. I learned how to add another color and how to put the mittens together. I found the abbreviations a little confusing and the substitutions weren't totally accurate (counterpane stitch substition for slip stitch wasn't clear when adding or dropping stitches). Also, I could have used more detailed instructions on how to put the mittens together. I liked that there were contemporary patterns (tank top, tote bag, hat) instead of patterns that remind me of my grandmother. This is worth buying for the cool patterns, even though the instructions may drive you batty."
4,Good beginner and reference book!!,"I disagree with the reviewers who say this isn't good for beginners. It has very clear instructions. It isn't exhaustive but it is good to teach you how to read patterns and do buttons, braids, tunisian, broomstick lace, flowers, filet, etc. Teaches the puff stitch and the cluster stitch nicely! Lots of various stitches and some good patterns. Tells you the weight of yarn used in the pattern so you can easily substitute from your stash. Patterns: large shopping bag, padded coat hangers, book covers, rug, pillow cover, mittens (child & adult), camisole, child & adult Aran sweater, blanket, a round & a square pillow, throw, small & large bags, hairband, slippers, shade/window edging and a stole."
2,SOOOOO not worth the money,"I have made 3 different projects in this book and have yet to be able to even get halfway through any of them without running into this book's biggest problem. The instructions (...)! They are worse than any I have ever come across. The author put at least one stitch in ever project that isn't explained in the book and at least one stitch that isn't explained until later in the book. Also, the pictures in the book look okay until you try to use them to make sure you have the stitch right (the one that you just had to improvise) and then the pictures are so blurry its impossible to tell what the final product is supposed to look like. The few good things about this book are that it does have cute projects (in theory...grr) and it goes over tuscan crochet and broomstick lace. Really, it be worth it to buy seperate books on those subjects than waste your money on this one."
3,Good but not for beginners?,"I borrowed this book from the library and found plenty of interesting items. I chose about 8 patterns and/or stitches to study and jot down. The charts for the stitch patterns seemed fine, but the written instructions contained an astonishing number of errors, and I found simple typos in several spots as well. There must have been no proofreading at all. If the small portions of the book I looked at had so many errors, I wonder about the rest of it. I would still recommend the book for an experienced crocheter, and for a beginner only if he/she had a mentor on standby. If you prefer written instructions to charts, you may get frustrated."
2,Inconsistent,"This book has been in my library for many years. Every once in awhile, I take it out and try a new project; thinking that since my crochet skills have improved over the years, maybe this time I'll actually be able to complete one of the cute projects.But with each project I invariably hit a wall somewhere in the instructions.Thanks to many of the reviews here, I've finally realized that the problem is not me.It's a shame because when the instructions are good, they are very good. For instance, the instructions about how to crochet using a chart were clear and excellent.The inconsistencies in the quality of instruction are scattered through out the entire book, and I have never been able to complete any of the projects correctly.They wind up having wonky ad lib areas or they were never finished at all.This time, I will not be putting this book back on the shelf in my library.I'm replacing it with ""The Complete Photo Guide to Crochet."""
1,Waist,Just got the thing 20 minutes ago. Bought to replace my old torn AV cord. Audio plugs worked fine. Video input piece didn't work at all. Product wasn't as pictured on Amazon either. A truly waist of money.
1,Writing Tripe at an Age When One Should Know Better,"The dull musings of a middle-aged, white man who believes _ or at least has convinced a publisher _ that his own petty shortcomings and personal behavior concern America at large.I'm guessing Mr. Awbrey reaches deep inside and before the finish is able to drown his Melancholy in a newly discovered reservoir of self-approval found in the conventional ways, although I can't be certain because I couldn't make myself read that far. The more genuine but less likely possibility is that he remains hopeless at book's end. Portions of the book will interest several current or former Kansas people whose names are in it."
1,Another touchy-feely mis-explanation,"It is obvious that depression is caused by the lacking American diet and lack of exercise that many people are stuck with. This book tries to explain that the lack of touchy-feely values are to blame, but that is clearly baloney. Anyone who has changed his lifestyly using 'Fitonics', 'Fit for Life' or something similar can attest to that."
4,Sydney Barrows is Amazing!,"I read this book after I had read "" UNCESORED SALES STRATEGIES"" by Sydney. I just had to read it. After reading her previous book, I really wanted to find out about what she had previously done in greater detail. This book was well written & describes alot of great Business principles, that if read fom that perspective, I'm sure you can all get over the fact that she owned & operated a female escort service. I can see now, why colleges have reccomended this book for reading.I think if more Business owners ran their businesses like Sydney describes, their business would be flourishing. Treating her employees & clients with the utmost respect, its clear how her business thrived!!!"
3,Good and easy read,"The Mayflower Madam was a good depiction of the way Sydney ran the business. I was looking for something more graphic and into her experiences, but that was not included in the book. Not something I would read again, but it is a decent book."
2,Uneven Quality,"Fabric falling apart, threads coming out, pieces mis-sewn - made in China all the way. Took me several tries to get a good one."
4,Modern World,"Not quite as good as ""In the City"" of ""All Mod Cons,"" but still worth listening to over and over."
3,Good; weak by Jam standards,This second album is a letdown after their explosive first album (In the City) and their quieter third and fourth (All Mod Cons and Setting Sons). It has good songs but seems like leftovers from the first album.
3,Their Weakest Record,"Sandwiched between two of The Jam's very best records (In The City and All Mod Cons) and featuring a batch of mostly half-realized tunes, Modern World is basically a let down. Not a bad album so much as a hastily assembled collection of b side-worthy material that never really takes off. Buy every other Jam album first (yes, even The Gift)."
4,"Good product, bad price.","If you have a cake supply store near your house, try them first if you need to purchase glucose. The store near my house is 1/4 the price of the Wilton glucose and its the exact same product. I have used both to make modeling chocolate and fondant and they work equally well. I am very happy with the Wilton product, just not happy with their inflated price."
1,"Poor audio quality, I don't remember them ever sounding this bad",I can't remember REO Speedwagon ever sounding this bad. This is an old recording and really needs to be cleaned up - it's just plain muddy. Even the live DVD I have of REO sounds better than this garbage. Very disappointing.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS COMPILATION!,"I received this 2CD set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called ""mastering"". I have original un-mastered copies of some REO Speedwagon albums that sound BETTER than this set! I love REO to death and the track listing is good to go, but in all honesty, this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality. The band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for. I cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close. Save your money and wait."
2,STARTED GOOD-FADED FAST,"REO was a really good live band in the beginning, who backed it up with 3 excellent records in a row. Around the time ""Keep On Lovin'You"" hit it big on the charts, It was all over. Going for Pop hits is one thing, but really BAD pop hits is another. Watered down drivel with inane lyics was the new REO. ""Can't Fight this Feeling"" should be used to torture suspected terrorists!-And the lyrics? Nobody will ever mistake this for Dylan.So a few good cuts are to be found on disc 1, the rest of it is a painful waste. Too bad- since they started off so strong"
3,"Good collection, poor sound mixing","The compilation is acceptable. I might have picked a slightly different combination of songs, but this is definitely a workable listing. The sound mixing is another story entirely. The person that mixed/mastered this collection managed to completely change the sound. Playing the originals against this - there is absolutely no comparison. Go back to the original mixes."
4,And I'm gonna keep on lovin' REO,"This essential compilation proves that it was obvious when REO got a new lead vocalist. They went from sounding almost folk to sounding like an ultimate power-ballad 80's band. Listen to ""Lightning""... & once you've heard that listen to ""Keep on Lovin' You"". You'll know that there was, indeed, a great transition.If you are a casual fan, I'd suggest you'd invest your money on ""The Hits"" instead. It is more cut clean to the singles & leaves out everything that did not make it onto the Billboard Chart.Well, I believe it is time for me to fly..."
2,This DVD leaves a lot to be desired.,"When I ordered this concert, I had hoped that it would be as good as the Mothership Connection Concert DVD. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed as soon as I saw the length of the concert and the interviews with George between the songs. To make matters Worse the production of this concert SUCKS, whomever edited this concert and had the Bright Idea of messing up the flow of the Funk by mixing interviews between jams obviously doesn't have any appreciation for the Funk George Clinton& the P-Funk are known for. This is almost as bad as the editing of their set at Sinbad's Summer Jam on HBO."
3,"One of the few ""Live"" P-FUNK shows available, and it's CUT!!","First rule when you deal with P-Funk: We want the Funk ""UNCUT""! Five Stars for G.C. and the P-Funk All Stars, the audio, video, and crowd. Zero star for House of Blues production staff involved with this product. HOW DARE YOU FUNK WITH THE FUNK!!! Please take note, and hopefully, your future productions will benefit from this fiasco! I concur with jjhuntfox."
2,The sun is setting on these P-Funkers but they won't quit.,"This 1996 concert took place in Atlanta's House of Blues around the time of the Olympics. By any other standard, they performed well, but the expectations they carry as the world's best R&B touring band now works against them somewhat. A much better selection is the Mothership Connection tour (1977) which is also available on DVD. Defections and Father Time have taken their toll on this group but they gamely funk on. It's what they do. Songs include Flash Light, One Nation Under A Groove, Mothership Connection (Starchild), and Atomic Dog. True Funkateers will want this for their collection but the casual fan should pass. If you view the 1977 show and the 1996 show back to back, it looks like a say no to drugs ad."
2,"Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?","Did you see poor Michael Hampton frowning in the background, wondering 'why am I here'? For one of the great guitar bands to release a DVD with NO guitar solos is a crime. For one of the greatest harmony groups to release a DVD where the voices are completely inaudible is another crime. And the last crime ... the greatest funk band ever should NOT attempt to do rap. The Mothership Connection DVD is much better."
4,Some traditions are different,"My children questioned two pages:Page 17 reads: ""After adults hide the eggs, children have a lot of fun finding them"".My son said, ""Hey, I thought the Easter bunny hid the eggs?!!!"" andPages 20/21: (Shows a girl with an ENORMOUS Easter gift basket complete with a giant stuffed animal).Reads: ""On Easter, children hope that the Easter Bunny will bring them Easter baskets"".My son said, ""Hey, why didn't the Easter bunny bring US one of those?!!!""."
5,My Children's Favorite All-Time Book,"I have three children and this book has been a part of our family for many years. It became part of our family tradition to read The Tooth Fairy by Audrey Wood each time one of the children lost a tooth-they learned the words by heart! It's a cute story and has great pictures which really capture the children's imagination. Now that my children are all grown, I have saved this book to pass on to their children!"
4,Cute Book,"Since my mother-in-law doesn't speak english, I wanted books her to read to my son in Greek. This is a cute book, although the material is a little too old for my 4-month old (I can't be too picky as there are so few choices in the US that don't cost a ton!). Some of the pictures are dark blue and it could be hard to read the black print, but I think this will be a hit!"
5,CHEESE IS KING,Ok I just finished watching MAC DADDY with the CHEESE Commentary and OH MY HELLO! This was so funny I almost wet my pants. As a Fosters Fan and a Huge Fan of Cheese I just have to say this is the BEST SHOW EVER.When ever I am down I just turn on my Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends.If you have Season 1 Why would you not get Season 2?
4,A great product!,I received this product in record time from Amazon. I received the first 3 orders and later had gotten the rest of my full purchase. Thanks Amazon
1,"Americanism not ""Muticulturism""","This book is just more left wing liberal ""multicultural"" propaganda designed to infest Americans at a young age. Once I picked up this book I couldn't wait to put it down. Celebrate diversity? Celebrate personality! Celebrate character! Who cares what race a person is...Children should be given an education to read, write and manipulate numbers not waste their time celebrating ""diversity"". If you adults cannot tell and appreciate the differences of the next person that crosses your path that's your indifference. Let today's youth enjoy eachother for what they all are...children."
4,"Oh, yeah!",Jo Anne is head & shoulders above the competition as a ragtime artist. She has an amazing ability to sound like she has 30 or 40 fingers. One downside - other instruments are thrown in from time to time which are completely unnecessary - she can carry the whole show all by herself. Listen to the samples for an idea of her appeal.
5,Ragtime Music,I have loved JoAnn Castle for a lot of years. I used to watch her on Lawrence Welk. I am glad to have her music so I can listen any time.n Song choices are great.
5,Great Ragtime Listening!!,"I've read other reviews for this CD in which some buyers complained of Jo Ann's versions being played too fast, but I really love her style. When I'm getting stressed out at work and want to hear some oletime music that has a real carefree ""happy-go-lucky"" feel, this CD always picks me up and puts me in a much better mood. I believe it would bring a smile to MOST listeners. Just listen to the sample sound-bites on Amazon and see for yourself. I really love this CD!!"
4,GOOD,Looks good! This LONG sleeve camo shirt does need to be washed a few times to break it in. Its Rough and Stiff. Other than that it works great for my use!
3,Nice but size,"Very durable, design mached trousers I pruchased. Normally I wear large, depending on material I do XL. This time I should've, even after looking at some other reviews. But I have a some what small frame. I still kept it. It's for paintball. I have a daughter about my size, might just pass it to her. She's already took most of old military uniforms. Next time I will order a size up...more so for shrinkage during washing."
1,"OMFG,,,It arrived stinking of MOLD.","The pants are fine. The top however, REEKED of MOLD. I do not say this lightly. I don't know if it's going to fit as I immediately threw it in the washing machine. As bad as it smells, I don't see how the odor will be removed. I'd order this from someone else."
4,GOOD ELECTION,GOOD ELECTION IF YOU CHOICE THIS SHIRT FOR TRAINING OR PAINTBALL GAMES. PROBABLY THE PRICE IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE.
4,Replace the Subwoofer,"I purchased this Unit 6 months ago and already have toasted the Voice Coil in the Subwoofer. This is not covered in the Warranty (Customer Abuse). I bought this unit because of the good reviews and Yamaha name. The best thing I did was replace the subwoofer with a car subwoofer. Sure you go from the stock 6 ohm subwoofer to a 4 ohm subwoofer but you gain a great hybrid unit that rocks. Since I replaced the sub par subwoofer with a Polk audio DXI 104 SVX 10"" car subwoofer I've gained more decibles and performance. So that is why I am rating this unit a 4 star purchase. Great construction on the Box and the amplifer. Even with the cost of the unit and the $91.00 upgrade to a better subwoofer. I still paid less than the advertised price. The good thing is knowing if I destroy this subwoofer with Hours of Rockband I can always replace the Subwoofer and have a brand new powered subwoofer."
2,Breaks easily,"I have had two of these spades and for both, the blade broke about two inches from the bottom tip.For potting soil it should be fine."
4,Love this product but it broke,"I love this tool so I purchased it many times on Amazon as gifts for friends and relatives.Now mine broke while digging in damp clay. First bottom tip broke and next it broke about halfway down.I love this tool because narrow blade needs much less leverage to dig deep.I would give this tool a 5 plus, before it broke.I ordered replacement and hope it lasts longer or I will be more careful."
1,GET WHAT YOUR PAY FOR?,"OK, it's real cheap. But the male screw-in was barely soldered on so it became detached the first time I screwed it in, and had a heck of a time removing it from the socket. I had to re-solder it AND use epoxy glue to make it strong enough to withstand the weight of an outdoor floodlight."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Piece.of.crap.The box was ""new"" but already opened upon arrival, after it was packaged with little care (almost no padding.) I plugged it into my Toshiba with windows7. I tried using it with windows media center, but there was video with no sound coming through. I thought maybe it would work better with the provided software. That didn't work at all. So I packaged it all up in the the original condition, sent it back to New Jersey, filed for a refund, and didn't get a sufficient refund. We had spent over $18 on the product, then over $7 to ship it back. What did we get for a refund? $6. No freaking way. So we called amazon, and they got us an additional $6. Still very displeased with the whole situation. Giving the product a bad rating, as well as the seller, for not providing sufficient compatibility information or refunds. booooooooo."
3,very good,be sure you have the required computer (or above) when you want to record from TV or video imput
1,GREATEST DISCO HITS,THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THIS CD. IT WAS RETURN AFTER LISTENING TO THE FIRST THREE CUTS.
5,"love the watch, hate the repair","I have had this watch for 8-9 years and as almost everyone else here, I love it. Finish is great, look is great, it makes a statement (understatement??) and seems bombproof. I abuse it constantly - swimming, working outdoors, skiing, you name it. I'm on my third or fourth battery. Let's say it is well scuffed. My 4 year old kid likes to run around the house with it and play with the ""winder things"".Which brings me to the sad part of the tale. The other day the crown fell off. When I sent the watch in for a repair estimate, I was told that water had gotten inside and the watch needs a complete refurbishing. I guess that means ""new movement"". (Perhaps I neglected to close the pressure relief valve after the kid got done with it??) The price tag? $398.00 At first I was reluctant - but then I thought about how much good, hard use I've gotten out of it and how much I like it. So, repair authorized and we're all set for another decade.Don't hesitate to buy this watch."
5,Great Watch for the Money,"I bought this watch from an Authorized Dealer recently, and am very satisfied. Relative to some of the other watch brands out there, I think Omega is a great balance of luxury, quality and value.I decided on the quartz over the automatic movement for three reasons: (1) More accurate, (2) less expensive, and (3) the watch is a little bit thinner and lighter than the automatic movement (that said, it is still pretty substantial, weighing in at 150 grams or 5 1/4 ounces). It keeps exceptional time; in the four weeks I've had it, it has not lost or gained even a single second.I really love the look of it as well, sporty but not too big or over the top. Classic good looks in this model, which I think will never go out of style. My only slight complaint is that the ""wavy"" background on the blue dial makes it a bit hard to read the watch in certain lighting conditions -- moving your wrist to a different angle corrects the issue. Overall, I am very happy with it."
1,alll omega's from amazon are fake,"do not spend your money on luxury watches. they will be shipped from Malaysia, and are Fake.there is little recourse - so don't waste your time."
4,"Husband loves this watch, get lots of compliments","My husband had been eying this watch for a while so I got it for him as a birthday present. He seemed pretty happy when I gave it to him, wears it all the time and gets loads of compliments on it. Frankly, I don't think it's as attractive as other lesser priced watches but I guess it's what he wanted and that's what matters!"
1,Disappointed,"What a beautiful watch. We attempted to buy it at the sale price of $617, for Christmas 09. The website said ""in stock"" 1 left, so we put in the order immediately. Here is the problem: We received two emails. The first was this morning saying that the watch couldn't be delivered until January. We agreed to wait. Then this evening we received another stating that this watch could not be obtained from the supplier due to 'lack of availability'. As of today, the price has been raised to over $1000, and still says ""in stock"". Why is this item still being advertised when it is clearly not available? Or is it just that it isn't available at the price we were going to pay for it? Either way, this was a bad experience."
3,buy this for look,"You'd buy this for looks as it does the same trick as a regular salt n pepper set. Finish is beautiful, fit was a bit disappointing"
5,Nice product,The tool set is nice quality. I also got the 7 dollar green case to go with it so I would not loose any tools. It's worth it in my opinion. I mainly use this for my align helicopters. Works great
5,"Strong, Excellent","Wiha Tools. Only the best! Fits, feels good. Solid.All submitted reviews are subject to the license terms set forth in our Conditions of Use."
5,Not a toy,"For some reason Amazon has classified this as a toy. Its a tool, not a toy.Wahi makes some quality stuff. These hex drivers are for very very small set screws and similar. I used them to repair some electronic micrometers. Buy the pouch to protect the tips but beware the pouch they recommend doesn't actually have enough slots for all the drivers (if you buy the standard size as well).Overall they worked perfectly. A good purchase for a quality tool.These are top notch tools. I"
2,Not like they used to be,"I have worn Reebok DMX walking shoes for years and loved them. These new ones were small in the toebox area and have NO arch support. Since I bought them on-line, rather than hassle with returning them, I spent anothr $30 and bought some supportive insoles, which do help, but the shoes are not as comfortable as other DMX walkers I have owned. I will likely switch to another brand next time."
1,Poor Presentation By Using Wrong Photo,I have used the DVD's that are shown in the picture but what you get is not what is pictured. The speed I expected was 8x but I received 16x. I went ahead and tried them and they would not play in any of the DVD players. If I had known that you were misleading your product I would have never bought from you.
2,Don't buy,I received this watch two years ago from my husband and it looks worn out. I only wear it on occasion but the gold part is all faded. I do not recommend buying this watch if you are looking for quality.
3,INFO: This pack does NOT contain Tony Hawk 2,"Contrary to the above review, this game DOES NOT contain the demo for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater too. It contains demos for Gran Turismo 2 and Coolboarders 4 amongst other things."
4,More like 3.5 stars,"I glanced through this book being rather skeptic. Not that many books made by Gaijins can even be considered decent. However, this book actually made me laugh quite a bit, especially the part with ""Yoisho..."" I am an American, and have been living in Japan for almost 12 years now. I love it here, and this book really does hit the nail on the head. It's good for a few laughs, nothing serious... Read it, enjoy it..."
5,Old Drac with is coffin and lovely bat!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you favor the Classics this is definitely one for you. Nice details...including the coffin sand. Great amount of extras....and the box itself arrived in Grade ""A+"" status. Perfect addition to the whole collection of Famous Classic Monster Movies from the days before all the special effects we now experience with the Van Helsing genre'...etc. Bela Lugosi in all his glory...I prefer the B+W version...as it's much truer to the original film. Nice coffin includes enough sand weight to thrill any youngster....although I plan to put this baby away in deep freeze for the grandkids in 10 to 20 years. A steal at its green price...and I just love how Amazon was able to give me Bela, Frank and Lon Chaney the Wolfman. Nice set...with the tree and bat....sets the stage for a great shelf display for my young grandson's room many years from now. Such a steal of a price....grab it while you can!"
4,Perfect for My Bucket List!,"I always wanted to visit the Library of Congress and finally made a plan to go recently. I knew Margaret Truman's 27 mysteries were all centered on Washington. She Had to have one on the LC! Thank goodness she did. This is as good as a guide book. So much insider information packed in this little tome. The story was not the most original by today's standards, but it was told very well. The characters were all believable and interesting. Big surprise or twist at the end? Not really, but she had me to the last page. From now on, whether it's for information or for mood, when it come to Washington, I am going to Margaret first!"
4,Fun Mystery,"This was my first Margaret Truman mystery, and after reading many of the others, this one is still my favorite. A noted scholar and researcher is murdered at the Library of Congress. A part-time researcher, a famous reporter, and many others in the library solve bits and pieces of the murder. I found this book engrossing, and read the entire thing in one day."
2,Get this ESPECIALLY if you didn't like the album,"There aren't a lot of Beach Boys fans who liked the ""Stars & Stripes"" album.But even if - ESPECIALLY if - you didn't like the album, this thing has some redeeming value.The Beach Boys' harmonies, that were buried under the country stars' vocals, are highlighted on the performances on the DVD. In fact, in many cases they are ""shown"" recording them, and you can hear them without the rest of the record.You get to see four of the original Beach Boys together for probably the last time, working, talking, playing together, and it's kind of fun...especially seeing Brian Wilson in good health and spirits.Finally, it has probably the last available footage of an actual live concert with Brian, Mike, Al AND Carl...worthy for that alone.It ain't a great thing, but it is historically important. You won't hate it near as much as ""Stars & Stripes""."
4,"Another winner for Beach Boys (and Junior Brown), especially '409'...","Lovely Lorrie Morgan and kitchy JuniorBrown [Jamieson Brown, Jr.] lead an all-star cast in producing NashVegas saluteto/with the surviving Beach Boys. Especi-ally Junior Brown's '409' is outstandinghere. The Beach Boys were the best! Andat least they were American, not Britslike the slimey 'Beattles', et, al!"
1,Below Average,"This is a workman like effort by the author. The story, spy vs. spy in Europe, is not a new one and you will not find anything memorable here. Overall the book is average and there are much better books out there."
5,"With ""Prestige"" you get Exactly what you order!","I ordered 150 ct, and that's what I got..unlike ""Restockit"". I was amazed with this company ""prestige"" they even upgraded my order to DHL Express, I got it in 2 days, no X chrg. Mailers were packed extremely well. I will continue to do all my office supplies thru ""prestige"""
2,Out of date . . . .,"Probably my fault but of little use. Skimmed through it and picked up virtually no tips, would like to find something of use but this is not it."
2,2004 Usagi Yojimbo Action Figure,YOU CAN NOT ARTICULATE THE LEGGS FOR DIFFERANT POSES. The figure looks good but you want to be able to do more with it.
3,Much smaller than advertised,I bought for my 8 year old son to do therapy and it's too small for him. The advertising said it was the right size for someone 5 feet tall.
2,Dim light,"The sensor seemed to work fine as far as on at dusk and off at dawn. However, like others, I found that it significantly dimmed the bulb. My 100W bulb seemed more like a 40W, which wasn't useful to me as far as providing night time safety. I returned it."
2,Erratic,"Kinda works, but often the bulb will flicker. Don't know if I just got a bad one but sure wouldn't buy another...."
2,Dim bulb,"Works great - but drastically dims the 60w watt bulb I was using. Now I have a 100w watt bulb in this device but it doesn't get as bright the original 60w bulb did. Not sure I'm really saving any energy by trying that tactic.According to the technical details this device is rated for 150w but I believe the item title stating 15w is the true number. My fixture is only rated for 100w bulb so I can't go to an even higher wattage bulb. And so I will be looking for something else. (As advertised, it does not work at all for compact flourescent causing major flicker - also likely due to the low output problem - too bad.)"
1,Totally unreliable,I have owned more of these than I care to admit. Totally unreliable. amazon carries a ridiculously expensive version also which I'll try
4,Auto Photo Control,"For the price, I got what I expected and they work as described. 1 of the 4 does not work properly and that is why I bought 1 more than I needed. They suffice for what I needed them for."
2,can't use fluorescent bulbs,"Dusk-to-dawn functionality works with incandescent bulbs, but you can't use energy efficient fluorescent bulbs with it (get really bad buzzing throughout home and light flickers)."
1,Unsuitable voltage,"Unfortunately I didn't spot that this light ocntrol is for USA voltage of 110v, and as the UK functions on 240v I cannot use the item. Oh dear...."
1,The quality sucks,Never worked since I opened the box. The light blinked after I installed this item. It was daytime. Don't buy it.
3,Disappointed,Bought 3 at once. One didn't work at all ...one works but is super-touchy ...and the third one works fine.
1,Garbage,Don't waste your money. I bought 3 of these and within 2 weeks all three were non-functional.
1,bad socket,"I also bought two of this, and they do not work at all or one would work turning light on\off and then just stop functioning. Product needs quality control."
2,"The saying is....""You get what you pay for""","I have to agree with many of the reviews....-dims the brightness of the light bulb-light flickers-sometimes a hit or miss if it turns off the light at dawnSo again, in this case, ""you get what you pay for."" You did not pay much for the item and thus the quality is poor.So...."
1,This is not a very good product.,I bought 2 of these for my back porch. One stopped working after about 2 hours; it flickered and then went off. I had brand new 60 watt bulbs. Now I am back to the switch in the house. It costs almost as much to ship as the cost of the photo controls. You are absolutely wasting your time and money to buy this product.
1,does not work with compact florescent bulbs,"It caused one of our three outdoor lights to flicker like a strobe light - just awful, the other two turned on the first try, but subsequently refused to turn on at all. I will be returning these..."
2,Nikons 12X50 Action binoculars,"The Nikon 12x50 had a sharp image, but I had problems with them fogging up even while using them in my living room or in back porch. It would take only about one minute and the eye piece was fogged up. I might think that the model ""Extreme"" which are anti-fog might be a better choice because they are supposed to be filled with a gas. I sent the binoculars back because after one minute they were not use to me.The seller (17th street Photo )refunder my credit card, so I was happy with their responce.I would use them again."
3,Good view.,"Purchased the binoculars for a son at Christmas. I believe I paid about $75. Compaired to a cheap pair of 10x40 binoculars I had purchased years ago, the view was quite good. The binoculars are sturdy and feel well made. Looking through them for an extended period of time was not hard on the eyes. I don't really have any experience with which to compare these to a more expensive set, but I was quite satisfied with the quality I had purchased for the price."
4,Nikon 7216 Action 8x40 Binoculars,"I love these binoculars. Crisp clear picture, better distance viewing than I'd thought.I am a beginning birder and bought them mostly for birding.So far they fit the bill perfectly!"
5,"Very good, solid product","This bino set is an absolutely great deal for the money - clear views, crisp lines, and easy to use. Even takes a good lick and keeps on going. Great value!"
4,Great pair for everyday use,"I used to won a pair of Bushnell, and when the broke I wanted a more powerful pair of binoculars. These fit the bill for price and performance. I have owned these for about 8 years now, and under a lot of use, (hiking, biking, birding - etc) they have held up very well. The only problem I have with them, is that one of the threaded rings holding the lens together has loosened up some, causing it to be out of focus. This is a simple fix for anyone with any amount of mechanical skill and some locktite.Under hard use, they are still rock solid - even after 8+ years of abuse. Very good value for a good pair of binoculars."
4,satisfied with Nikon binoculars,I purchased these binoculars to replace the Bushnell10x50 Falcons which did not last very long. The firstBushnell binoculars lenses went out of alignment so Iopted to purchase another to replace it rather than go through the hassle of sending it back to be repaired as they were inexpensive. It wasn't long before the second Bushnell also went out of alignmentso both were useless. I looked for another brand and decided on the Nikon Action 10x50 because of the Nikonlens reputation and favorable reviews for this binocular. Although pricier than the Bushnell I couldsee the clarity and sharpness was better. I focused on the eye of a seagull and was impressed with the detail I could see including the fineness of it's feathers. Although on the heavy side I could tell thatthe Nikon was more sturdy and better quality than theBushnell. I would reccomend them for being a well madepractcal binocular that serves it's purpose well without having to spend too much money.
5,great for stargazing,"I purchased these binoculars to view the night sky, and the results are impressive. We recently stopped on a dark country road and tested them out. The view was extraordinary; I could see detail that brought the sky to life. One caveat---the weight of the glasses mandates that to get the best results for stargazing you need to steady yourself on a solid object, such as an automobile, building, or tree; it is difficult to hold the glasses still very long without some type of support. For non-astronomical viewing this is not a problem."
2,Use With Care,"These binoculars are very good in image quality, fit and finish. The case and strap it comes with is also nice, but they are not very shock proof. I don't mean rough using or deliberately being careless with these binoculars, but in normal and regular use the optics become misaligned and the image is out of the field of view or can not be focused. For the price of $81 it may sound like a bargain but I would suggest the Nikon Extreme EX series instead,Nikon 7245 Action Ex Extreme 10 X 50 mm All Terrain Binocularsas a better option for about $132. If these are more expensive, then I would suggest getting the 8x40 instead.Replacing these after a year of use, primarily at national parks observing geographical features and wildlife, I was disappointed the optics misaligned as I wanted these to last at least 5 years at this price. If Nikon improved the shock proof capability only slightly, I would be happy to pay $100 for these binoculars."
4,glad I bought this item,the binocular Nokon 8x40 is a very fine item in every wayexcept it is a little heavy to hold to eyes for a long time
5,Great Value,"A terrific improvement over my old clunkers. A terrific, general purpose binoculars, at a reasonable price."
1,Not a good choice,"If you are looking for ""Nikon"" quality in this binoculars, you'll be disappointed. It's a cheap, toy like workmanship product from China.I bought it becasue of the low price. There are no such thing as ""free lunch"". Don't buy."
4,Good Purchase,"For the price you can't go wrong. Really good pair of binoculars that served their purpose well. Used on a cruise for wildlife viewing and saw bears, goats and whales that we would never have seen with the naked eye. Also do okay for stargazing.Would like for them to have a tri-pod feature and possibly stronger, but can buy up for my next purchase."
5,Great for 'Action',"I bought these Binoculars over a year ago. They were a display model and had been handled thoroughly, however the optics were still extremely clear. I bought them to replace Bushnell H2Os that I had dropped and broke while exiting my vehicle.These ride in my exclusively in car in my gear bag, and sometimes on the hard plastic center console, and they've survived several drops onto pavement from 3-4 feet. They've remained clear and true in this time. Low light viewing and night time viewing are great. Awesome product. Will probably give these to my parents and purchase the 16x50 or the zoom model for extra range.I would not just buy these again, I will buy Nikons for life."
5,Nikon Binoculars,"I want to learn more about stargazing, so I was looking for a binoculars for a long time.When I saw it from amazon, I was deeply attracted by the price and the function.When I receive the binoculars, It was brand new,good and easy to use. But this is winter so may be I must found some day of good weather to have stargazing with my new toy."
5,Great for taking to NFL games,I bought these for my Husband for Christmas to take to Colts games. He was extremely pleased with the clarity. The pair he had before just didn't come close to these. Pam
5,Nikon Binoculars,"Brilliant for the price. My 9-year old son can use it... so thats that about the weight... No problems at all. If you need a good binocular, and nothing seriously exotic, then this is it. Stop hunting and buy."
5,Excellent Clarity,"We purchased these binoculars for birdwatching in our neighborhood and couldn't be happier. Excellent optics, bright and clear. We also purchased the Nikon 7216 8x and are equally impressed. Only drawback is that they are a bit on the heavy side."
5,.Met my expectation,Very easy to operate and gathers lots of light with sharp in focus images. I find the lenses caps somewhat cumbersome attached to the straps..
5,Incredibly clear,"I'm not an expert on optics or binoculars. I just wanted to have a pair that were good, reliable and reviewed well. First impression on these is that they are excellent. A very clear image and very bright colors. I am very happy with this purchase and the other positive reviews are on point."
4,nikon,"Good but not great. A little larger and heavier than I had hoped. Not quite the power I was hoping for either, but this was my first pair of binoculars so I really did not know what to expect. Vision is clear when focused properly."
1,OUT OF FOCUS,"Received my 7216 Nikon binoculars. I am stating which series I bought because Amazon bundles together several in their reviews which is not right.I know what to do with binoculars...but for the life of me cannot see out of these! They are not in focus no matter what I do ! ! !A real waste of money. Truly a waste of money........What's more is that I really needed them! I believed in the reviews and got a ""lemon"" pair I guess."
4,Christmas Gift,"The Nikon binocular was received on time and after looking it over, we were impressed with the quality."
4,I Love it!,This is my second binocular.I really appreciate with its clear and robustness.Nikon will be my 3rd binocular too!
5,Love it,"Hmmm, new house on the river, big birds everywhere...was that a Bald Eagle?Googled ""learn about binoculars"" and ended up at Amazon. Found these Nikons, read the reviews from others (fantastic resource), and bought 'em. Can't say enough how happy we are with them. Every technical comment written in the other reviews was dead on. They're light, awesome clarity, super value for the price, and perfect for bird watching in dim or bright light. The Blue Herons, Osprey, Red tailed Hawks, Cormorants, & Bald Eagles (and much more) never looked better. We can't put these Nikons down."
5,Terrific!,"I ordered these binoculars to use for bird watching. They are terrific, just what I was looking for. Highly recommended."
4,Pretty good binocs,"On the whole I'm pleased with these. This is my second pair of binocs, the other being a bottom line Bushnell. These have a clearer image unquestionably and better ergonomics in the eyepieces, focus adjustment, and grips. I will say that the lens caps are a joke - they don't stay on at all. Ironically, the Bushnell caps are far superior and fit better, so I've switched them."
3,Amazon just can't get it right when it comes to country of manufacture,"This thing is made in China. I'm really not interested in buying stuff from a communist country if I can avoid it. So, I'm buying a German made Steiner and will do a comparison and update my review after a side by side comparison."
2,Cheaply Made.,"I paid $108.00 back in 2009 for these 12x50 Nikons and found out later, that they are no better than a pair $35.00 Binoculars.They were not Defective, just your run of the mill, off the rack Cheappys. Ok at $25 to $35, not a penny more."
4,great for the price,These are good. I have another pair that are three times the price. They are little better. I bought the nikons for veiwing wildlife with someone and for everyday use. Not sure about weather proof/ fog proof .
5,Great pair of Binoculars,I have a Nikon 10x22x50 my husband gave me several years ago. We go bird and whale watching every year in Hawaii and I got this pair for him. I never really use the zoom on mine because the picture becomes a little distorted. He loves these binoculars and I do too. I think they are a bit crisper and clearer than mine.
5,Good Purchase,Got everything I wanted in a moderately priced binoculars. My dog ate the last pair so I'm not willing to invest big bucks in a new pair. I tried a few pair that came in plastic at the sporting goods store but they just did not cut it. I would recommend these to anyone looking for similar priced binocs.
4,Great Product,"I bought these for birding and have been very pleased. They are very sharp and I am able to identify birds along with the rest of my group. Two things, the diopter adjustment seems to move during use as I am constantly having to adjust back to it's original position and there seems to be slight distortion at the very edges of view, not enough to bother me. I really do love them! Go Nikon!"
4,Excellent low-cost binoculars,"Just a nice product, that lives up to the Nikon name. Not overweight, it's well-balanced and a good combination of size, magnification, light-gathering objective lens size, and clear optics. It even has well-designed lens caps. Very satisfied with this product."
5,tommy's review,"service was great, got it very fastthe binocular was of very good qualityvery happy with my purchasethankstommy"
4,Great for the price,"I researched binoculars for an upcoming Alaska trip and saw someone say these were used on the whaling boat they went on. So I went to Walmart and actually looked at them and used them there (but they were $20 less on Amazon!) and I liked them. They are lightweight and they come with a neckstrap, lens covers and a padded nylon square case to protect them. They are clear and you can see far and they aren't shaky (like the higher power 10+ binoculars can be). The reason I gave them a 4 star instead of a 5 is because when I looked through them at Walmart everything looked really close so when I took them to a park and viewed a hawk in a tree I was a little disappointed and thought it would look bigger. I guess that's not really the binoculars fault though because I guess that is all 8x power gives you. If you are looking for bincoculars that you can use with a tripod I would suggest going higher power, but for vacations and not too far bird viewing these are great :)"
5,"Excellent optics, sensational value!","The Nikon Action 8x40 binoculars are terrifically sharp and bright and are a tremendous value compared to the 'bargain' binoculars offered by other manufacturers in this price range. This binocular is a sturdy, durable-feeling handful that comes with an excellent strap and solid covers for both pairs of lenses. Very sharp, accurate color rendition, easy and rapid focus. A Nikon product worthy of the name."
4,Great for bird watching,I bought these to replace a pair of Nikon 10X40 that I had been happy with but wanted to renew. They are excellent and make a big difference in detail and clarity. Not too heavy as I thought they might be. A little issue with shake when viewing at long distance but not much.
4,A quality product,The image is crystal clear...the focus is responsive and smooth...the only negative is the weight which if you are viewing for an extended period of time (over fifteen minutes) can be tiresome.
5,Clear and Easy,"I was in the market for some good but not so expensive Binoculars. I tried these at the local sports store but found a better deal on Amazon. I love the sharpness and the ease of use with these. I don't find these heavy at all, and with a tripod set up they are even better. I use these for scoping out new hikes and rocks to climb and take these with me everywhere. Recommended"
5,Nikon 7216 binoculars,"Bought a new pair of Nikon 7216 8x40 binoculars from Amazon and let me tell you, they are great..tried number of pairs from wal mart but never was satisfied with any of them.wal- mart was good. no problem when i returned them,,,8x40 is just right for hand held looking but can attach a tripod..they are so clear that it is almost unbelievable. just heavy enough to feel good. great strap and case,,objective lens caps are good but they should find a way to let them hang when viewing not loose with a chance to loose them..all in all if you want a great pair of binoculars be sure to try these,,,,,not water proof but how many times are you going to get caught in the rain....... eugene bowden"
1,Unacceptable!,"I was shocked and appalled when I listened to this label's re-issue of these classic recordings. They obviously either couldn't get their hands on the original masters, or didn't bother to. The cd's are recorded FROM A VINYL RECORD- and not even a decent copy (complete WITH CLICKS AND POPS!) With the Mosaic re-issues sadly no longer available, there's unfortunately no other way to find this wonderful music. Never-the-less, don't waste your money on these versions."
5,Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Collection,"A ""must-own"" CD for any fan of big-band music. This set contains CLASSIC material from the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra that is very hard to find. Some of their BEST repertoire - ""Little Pixie,"" ""Groove Merchant"" - on and on."
1,No response to order canceled,"This produce is $5.99 Shipping changed after I agreed to buy, from 14.95 to 18.95 for this $6 toy. I sent e-mail thru amazon to speedytoys ""cancel this order, shipping outragous. I called them and was sent to a full voice mail. All this was the same day that I ordered. A week later they sent a shipping e-mail. I sent them a e-mail thru Amazon ""I sent e-mail to cancel, no response. I have spoken with Amazon about A to Z garantee I will hold item unopened for 2 days await response. I will not pay to ship as I canceled same day. Item was shipped a week later it is not my fault there is no one in this company handling costomer service."" This company is in the business of cheating people. DO NOT BUY FROM SPEEDYTOYS"
2,Not as bright as the original PL Fluorescents.,"I bought these hoping to replace my outdoor PL-style fluorescent lamps due to the fact that the fluorescents get dimmer with the cold weather (when they actually start up). These fit and work, but they aren't nearly as bright as the original PL fluorescent lamps. (I have some of the CREE LED's in other outdoor fixtures and they are very bright for the wattage consumed). The bottom line: I returned them."
4,I Looked for This on CD for Years,"For those not familiar with the music of Paul Quinichette, he was known as the Vice President, as opposed to Lester Young, known as the President. At times they sound so similar I would easliy mistake Quinichette as Lester Young. However, if you listen to enough of his music you realize he is original in his own right. Their sound, phrasing and licks are often the same as Quinichette had Young's style down to a tee. Count Basie hired him and he played many of the solos that Young had played in the band. This was many years after Young had left the band. I had this recording on LP many years ago and looked for it for years on DVD. Often such recordings are released with little fanfare and one does not realize they are available on DVD. Luckily, I found this by accident and purchased it."
3,Has issues that should be addressed,"When is works it is an outstanding burr grinder, however, with 240 pounds of beans through the machine, about half of the recommended usage before new burrs, it has developed a irritating quirk. The coffee beans become impacted within the body of the grinder, and only by disassembling the components does it become functional again. It appears the body throat is too narrow. Messy it is, which creates waste."
5,Good coffee grinder,"I'm not a big coffee connoisseur, I don't make espresso or have any use for extra fine ground coffee, I just like the taste of fresh brewed, fresh ground coffee. This grinder is really good for that. About the only thing it's missing is a timer - I have to time the grind myself - about 18-20 seconds on setting 6 for a Bunn thermal coffee maker. I had a blade style grinder before and the grind was inconsistent - lots of larger sized particles and a few really fine. I never could get consistent grind. I always get a consistent grind from this one."
2,Less than satisfied,"The grind is not as uniform as the burr grinder built into my previous Capresso set up. The Kitchenaide has an awful design for recieving grounds. The lower glass container is a pain to get in and out of its place. After grinding you have to remove the glass container and it ALWAYS means spilling grounds all over counter top. I would not recommend this product. A good brand name and a heavy, solid design do nothing to overcome it's flaws."
5,Kitchenaid burr grinder,This is a real professional model. I had a Capresso that crapped out after trying to make 2 grinds. I think I could grind all day with the Kitchenaid and not have a problem. A real thumbs up for this grinder.
1,No longer supported by KitchenAid-DO NOT PURCHASE,"My KitchenAid KPCG100NP ProLine Burr Grinder stopped working last week. Part that failed is a cheap plastic gearbox assembly that is not available from KitchenAid, or anywhere else for that matter. I've finally given up. Although the machine is otherwise built like a tank, and performs very well, a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link. Calls to their Customer Service department have been futile. I have to STRONGLY recommend against buying this item."
4,Solidly built and very quiet.,"It's built like a tank and it's quiet so you won't wake up the whole house with it, which is very nice. It took a bit of doing to find just the right setting and amount of coffee to use in order to get the coffee exactly the way I like it, but now with that out of the way I'm very happy with it."
2,"ok, inconsistent grind","The reviews from one of those coffee-review websites suggested this grinder, but it did not perform as well as expected. The grinds are inconsistent through out all settings."
2,needs improvement,"A machine that both stops grinding beans or gets jammed because of beans is no ""bean grinder"". Since this unit costs almost $200 you expect much more from it. It has a Hefty motor but sometimes the beans don't move down into the grinder, the throat appears to be too small."
1,"Love the shirt, hate the price","I purchased the pink one from another seller and my dog looks very cute in it. I paid $10.00 for the shirt. DON'T buy THIS shirt from this seller, it is priced way too high. See if you can find it on Google. It is Casual Canine brand. I want to purchase two more for my boys but not with this seller. I'm saddened that the seller isn't making a sale because of his price.Too bad, I would have purchased from them if the prices were right.So the style and quality of this doggie sweatshirt is very good. It has been washed several times and keeps the size. If you have a 10-13 pound dog, the medium will fit just right. My Maltipoo is about 11 pounds and the shirt fits snug around the legs and looser around the belly, it is perfect! I really wish this seller would drop the price."
4,great nature sounds CD's,"These are fantastic CD's. The recordings have excellent clarity. Every track in the set is different from one another. Furthermore, the sounds within each separate track vary in intensity and subject matter. However, the box set lacks wind sounds."
4,Une bonne curiosité,"De Meyerbeer, peu d'opéras ont été représentés sur scène : Les Huguenots, et Robert le Diable principalement. Ce ""Crociato"" est donc le bienvenu. Bien mis en scène et bien interprété, il ne bénéficie pas, cependant, des prestigieuses distributions des sus-nommés (Corelli, Sutherland, Ramey, Anderson...). Il n'en est pas moins vivement recommandé de l'apprécier, car il est dans la veine des grands Rossini qui furent remis au got du jour dans les années 80-90 (Ermione, Otello, La Donna del Lago...).A défaut de grandes voix, les chanteurs ont de jolis timbres et une technique suffisante pour faire partager le plaisir de la découverte vis-à-vis d'une oeuvre qui, bien que marginale, gardera toutefois le parfum de la nouveauté."
2,mediocre. Sólo para coleccionistas,"Se trata de un cd doble.El primer disco "" Psychedelic Psoul "" no tiene demasiado interés. Está cantado en inglés y no hay ninguna canción destacada. Recuerda a los Monkees pero sin la gracia de estos.El segundo disco ""Hard Rock from the Middle East"" tiene algo más de chispa.Está cantado en árabe y tiene dos o tres canciones muy interesantes. Más cercano a la world music que al rock duro. Recuerda un poco a un disco más reciente y mucho más recomendable grabado por Cheikha Remitti llamado Sidi Mansour(con colaboraciones de Flea).En todo caso, es un disco prescindible pero con algunas canciones interesantes para sorprender a tus amigos más ""puestos""."
5,The Best for your buck,This Little GPS is the best I have used for the money. If I boot up with it attached by the time I open streets and trips it is synced up and ready.
5,nice item,"very fuctionally, Very good article, very good deal nice, very good price, item arrived on time, the packaging had an acceptable size"
1,"Drops signal, does not function",I connected mine to an Acer Laptop with various map programs and this GPS will work at my home but after I start traveling it will quit tracking. Using Delorme GPS software it will not keep up.
2,wouldnt work,"I bought that for my sons pickup, his pickup is 32 yr's old so it could not be used in it. and i had to return it."
5,Great device,"I haven't tested it a lot yet, but the build quality is good. It works perfectly fine on Windows 7 (be sure to run the GPS INFO UTILITY with administrative rights to detect the COM ports, otherwise it's not going to show any of the COM ports to get access to the device). It works fine with Garmin Mobile PC, it's just like having a Garmin GPS in your computer. The magnet inside the device is strong enough for a firm attachment to any metal surface."
1,Terrible,"My laptop computer will not recognize this product , the software was installed using Vista and it says the USB port is working with that software. I have emailed the company requesting support they have not answered my request. Don't waste your money."
4,Very Pleased Customer,"I bought this to use in my service truck with a tablet pc. I was completely disappointed with it at first because it would not work out of the box. I was about to return it if not for a week of fiddling with it and scouring the internet for soultions, I hit pay dirt and downloaded a program called SiRFdemo.exe and after installing it and running it, I switched the usb-gps receiver to NMEA mode and now it works amazingly well. I highly recommend this product. The SiRFdemo program will automatically synchronize the baudrate and com port for the device as well. The software ""GPS Info"" that comes with the receiver would only show gibberish from the device and say ""GPS Device not recieved"". I think SiRFdemo should come with the box! Then I would give it five stars!"
3,Worked,"I used this product as soon as I got it. I placed it on the roof of my FJ Cruiser and the magnet held it firmly regardless of speed driven. I did need a USB extension cable (Black 15 Foot USB 2.0 Extension Cable) to get to my laptop inside the vehicle, but that was no issue."
1,no good,"It does not work ,old software , causes blue screens , crashies computer,what more is ther to say ,maybe its made for windows 98 ? it does not work on windows 7 or vista,"
1,Doesn't work,"This gps unit has yet to work with any mapping program that I use. I have no problem using Handheld units with laptop in vehichle using serial cable and adapters, but this fails all the time."
5,GlobalSat BU-353 with Street Atlas software works very well,I'm using the BU-353 with Street Atlas 2011 and it works well. I set the GPS options according to the directions given on the BU-353 and it synched in less than a minute and works very well.
5,Fantastic!!,"Absolutely fantastic! It exceeded my expectations. It's solidly built (which was one of my concerns, given the cheap price), extremely easy to install, and very, very fast and accurate.I almost went with a more expensive model, just because I couldn't believe that such a cheap GPS could possibly work as well as advertised. I honestly expected a cheaply made GPS... but I was very pleasantly surprised!Just fantastic. If you're looking for a GPS receiver to use with a product such as Microsoft's Streets and Trips, or GRLevel 3 radar, or some other similar GPS compatible software, then look no further!"
5,Easy setup with Win 7,"I did not read anything about installation except that the baud rate for the serial port (USB) needs to be set at 4800. With that setting done via settings and devices, and with Streets and Trips running (2011 version), my location was pinpointed on the map in about 5 minutes in an area that is difficult for GPS satellite reception. I do not know how the GlobalSat will behave in real use on the roads, but my initial view of the product is very positive. With Win 7 and Streets and Trips, the CD and the directions are not even needed; in fact, Macromedia flash crashed when the CD loaded and it is required to load driver, read the pdf file, etc. Win 7 got the correct driver from the internet as soon as I attached the GPS receiver."
5,Google Earth Friendly,"Wanted to interface Google Earth with a GPS and this piece of kit was excellent. Had to download a special program called Earth Bridge to get Google Earth to recognize the GPS data (GE only accepts direct access to a couple of GPS receivers)Now with laptop, wireless internet, GE and my GlobalSat I have an accurate live navigation system.Great buyHappy navigating"
5,Don't get lost!,"I use this on my laptop for navigation on the sea as well as on the road with SeaClear and Microsoft Streets and Trips. Some times take a bit to configure it, but starting it with the software each time makes it easier to set up. Then shut of the GPS program before using it on the other software."
2,no real mac software options available,"after reading tons about usb gps for months, i got this little device.seems to pick up ok with the test software. but is absolutely useless as a gps receiver for the mac. I have windows software to run it, but that sucks because then I'm on windows. do yourself a favor and get a real gps device instead of any of these silly usb gps receivers."
1,DOES not WORK with android tablets Support staff useless!!! a rip off,would not work with android mid 7 tablet which is why we bought it.called support. they were uselss. emailed me general links todeveloper websites. not helpful... product is junk
1,It's a true joke!!,"Definitively it doesn't work.I didn't get to install in Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7: it doesn't recognize the serial ports.Couldn't find a web page for help...It's a true joke!!I feel as if it had played my money in the garbage.Don't waste your money on it."
4,US Global Sat,I like it. It does a very good job but the cord could stand to be a couple of feet longer. I use it in my car and in my tractor trailer. It works great with my truck routing program but as I said the cord need to be longer so that it will reach the visor above the windshield. That's the only reason that it got 4 stars instead of 5.
5,Outstanding Technology!,"This works better than any other GPS receiver I have. Inside, at my offices in 2 different cities, takes no time at all to find itself. Light, portable, simple. GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,Delayed GPS,Computer: Dell XFROS: Windows XPSoftware: Delorme Street Atlas 2011This unit works okay. Not great. There is about a 1/4 mile delay in where the GPS unit says I am compared to where I physically am. I unhooked it and reverted back to my TomTom because it's much faster at telling me where I am. I use this for work and travel backroads/urban streets/interstates in KY and a lot of times the roads I'm on aren't marked.Overall I'm not happy with it. I went back to using my TomTom and this GPS unit now sits in my computer desk.
3,Waterproof--NOT!!!,"I purchased the BU-353 at Amazon to use with my Panasonic Toughbook and Microsoft Streets & Trips 2011. I have had it for about a week. I mounted the receiver on my trunk lid and it worked well--similar to what other reviews stated. Well, until it rained. Within 3 minutes after the steady rain started, it quit working. After drying it off, and putting it in the back window (inside the car) it did resume working after about a half hour or so. I now have it mounted there, but I question if it is working as well (signal wise) as it did when mounted on the trunk lid.I caution anyone who intends to mount this externally. There are screws holding the case together, and the wire has a stress grommet that does not look waterproof. Not sure if the moisture got in the screw holes or the wire hole.Very disappointed in the product. It should not be marketed as waterproof."
5,Excellent,"This USB GPS was required for marine navigation program. After loading supplied drivers, even worked with Windows 7. I had been using an older USB GPS with Windows 2000/XP but wouldn't work with Windows 7 (couldn't obtain drivers) so it had to be replaced. This GPS finds satellites and locks on very quickly. Highly recommended."
4,Excellent GPS Unit,Been using this for a couple of months now in my car. The unit as never had any trouble acquiring a signal and does so in a few seconds. Nothing bad to say about it in terms of performance (though I haven't had the heart to test its WaterProof feature yet!).The only issue I seem to have is that Microsoft Streets and Trips 2009 sometime has trouble communicating with the device. This usually happens if I put my laptop into sleep mode without shutting off the GPS. A quick log off and log back on seems to fix the issue. For reference I'm using a Lenovo x61 Tablet with Windows Vista.
3,Beware the version of Windows,Past use of one of these worked fine on my boat with Coastal Explorer. With my new computer and Windows-7 it causes the computer to crash. Solution: install the old drivers for Windows XP. Coastal Explorer recommends you not use this product but I find it works fine on both computers under Windows-7 but only using the old drivers from Windows-XP.
5,Works great.,"It took me a few days to figure out how to set up the port, but after the first trip of 400 miles it worked dead on. Quickly picks up location and works well on my netbook with Microsoft Roads & Streets 2011. Magnet is very strong. Would gladly recommend to anyone."
1,DOES NOT WORK with Street Atlas 2012,"Although the updates are more than a little thin for 2012, this is the GPS unit that is shipped in the Delorme Street Atlas 2012 package....FLAT OUT, the GPS will not work, no dirver support that works. Took out an old USB Earthmate GPS, worked right away, even locked onto 7 satellites inside an apartment....btw, when you order from Delorme, their concept of in-stock is ...oops out of stock it just went out in the mail....also Delorme places a sticker witout the Delorme name indicating the Street Atlas 2012 on a generic GPS receiver labled box...very cheaply integrated and it showes...how long will Delorme be around?....not worth the time to trouble-shoot their SW problems..."
4,After the Install its great!,"I just couldn't get it to work after installing it from the CD. I have Windows 7 64 bit, so you can never tell what will work. The drivers installed quickly but I found that GPSinfo program would not work from the disk installation, so I went on line to GlobalSat and downloaded GPSinfo from the site and it worked like a charm.Tried it in 2003 Microsoft Streets and Trips and it worked flawlessly. Locked on to satellites from inside my home by a window very quickly. It is important to adjust the settings in two places, the Device Driver menu on the computer and on the map software or it will not work.Highly recommended if you can get past the installation.Street Atlas USA 2011 Plus"
5,Spot on - good things do come in little packages,"quick start up. i have both RS-232 and USB version, both work great.heavy tree cover has little effect on them.be careful if you are home brewing cables, there is no reverse diode protection on the power input, if you reverse the polarity once, your done.had held up well for a verity of projects from APRS in a few different vehicles to 2 model rocket launches."
3,Could not get it to work with Vista,I had several people try to install this unit on a laptop with Vista with no success. I'm not sure if just because we don't know were doing or if it's not compatible. We are going to try to install it on a computer with XP. Hopefully we'll have more success.
5,GPS Receiver,I use this with my laptop and GPS software when I'm traveling by car. I like a large screen when viewing. It works well with my MSI Windows 7 laptop.
5,Global Sat Receiver,The Global Sat BU-353 USB Navigational Receiver was an excellent buy. Used it with my laptop out in a heavily forested mountain range it worked perfectly with my topografic software.
3,As expected,"After installing the software it works as advertised. It's easy to use, compact size and has a magnetized back with a rubber foot so it doesn't scratch. Can't complain."
5,"This is a great USB GPS unit, and it's inexpensive!","I bought this to use with SeaClear marine navigation software. Since it is waterproof, it is ideal for the purpose. With the CD provided, my laptop recognized the device immediately and emulated a serial port for me to set in SeaClear. I'm off and running (well, sailing actually). Previous attempts to configure Garmin GPS units were frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful."
5,great GPS,We use these at work and they work great. I got the software to make my netbook a GPS and needed a receiver to make it all work. This is the best one for the price.
3,Officially does not work with Windows 8,"I have Windows 8 and bought this device. Even after installing the drivers (I tried both from the CD and latest from the manufacturer's web site), the device manager would not start the device. I called GlobalSat tech support, and they said that Windows 8 is not and will not be supported by this chipset. Their recommendation is BU-353-S4, an almost identical but somewhat more expensive product with a newer chipset."
5,Great and accurate WAAS GPS,"I have used one for a year now and have just bought another for redundancy, who wouldn't at this price. We are permanent live aboard long distance cruisers and use Nobeltec Admiral Software in laptops; the reception is great inside the pilothouse and the same below decks in our office/den. Great prompt service from Amazon too!"
5,Great little GPS,I have been needing something like this to locate wifi AP's close to me. I gave this little one a try and I am glad I did. Even through the brick walls of my home it still picks up the satellites a d gets a lock. I now use it with Google earth from remote areas to mark spots where I have seen large populations of deer and rabbit. Looks like this hunting season will be a good year with this GPS on board.
3,inaccurate speed and distance,Not sure the point of a GPS that says I'm going anywhere from .5 to 3 Knots when I am sitting with the device in my office. If I hadn't already thrown away the paperwork I would send it back. Dont see how I could trust my boat and my life to a machine that cant tell I'm standing still.
3,"OK, if you're a Sinclair Lewis fan....","Clearly no match to his later, more recognized works, but interesting as a study in a writer's development. Key themes of his later work are present, though not as polished. Of particular interest is the writer's fearful depiction of the ""ordinary life,"" considering he was a striving, unrecognized writer at the time it was written. If you're just branching out into Lewis, I wouldn't begin here (try Main Street, first). But if you've read the big ones, you'll probably enjoy this peek at the early writer."
5,"""Tulsi Patra"" Its Heaven",Nothing can be written about how great it is to find the Himalaya Tulsi in USA. Thanks.
4,A litte outdated...,This is a very comprehensive book with lots of tips and tricks for the home recordist. Unfortunately it was written in the late 80's so it was not written with ditial media in mind. If youre lucky enough to own or use a reel-to-reel then this book is great.
1,Disappointing,"This is a very disappointing product. I only bought this because I thought it would be an improvement on my ICD-B15, but in fact this is a downgrade: it only has 2 folders(the B15 had five)and it only records in Long Play mode(though of course it does not state this anywhere in the manual) which means sound quality is half that of the B15's. Also there is no display light now. Goes without saying that the price is higher than that of the ICD-B15.Thanks a lot SONY."
1,Bad Customer Service,"I have many Sony products in my home and never had any issues until recently. I purchase a Sony MP3 player for my wife and the headphone that came with it was absolutely horrible. I followed their procedure and wrote to the Review Committee without any resolve. I decided to get a little tougher, and wrote to the CEO, Sir Howard Stringer only to have both letters forwarded to the twinkes in the Review Committee. This is very bad customer service and with all the energy and the time you spend on dealing with a problem, the product ends up costing you double its original cost."
4,Mermaid Activity Book,"This is a really neat book of mermaid and ocean-related crafts. I purchased this for my 5-year old daughter who loves mermaids. I think she will enjoy all the craft projects in the book, but I do not think she will be able to do any of them without significant assistance from me. There are many crafts that say to draw something (like a mermaid, fish, seahorse, etc) and cut it out. However, there are not really instructions for how to draw the pictures. I think this would be a fun book for younger children who have someone to help them with each project, and a great book for older children to work on more independently."
5,"Fun, easy activities","There are three great things about this book. The first is the price. The second is that the activities are simple enough for the average person can actually do them and make them look decent. Sometimes the examples in craft books are so cute but once you do them, they look awful. Such is not the case here. The third great thing is that the activities generally do not call for ridiculous materials. They're all pretty basic kids craft or around-the-house items."
1,clunky and horrible to use,"I bought this as I have used the free version for years. The interface is so clunky, it's beyond even trying. There is no option for free hand drawing. And, it doens't remember which directories I've saved vs opened from. I find myself clicking so much between the 2 that I just hate it and it's time consuming. I actually reinstalled the free version and am using that again. Next time, I will buy something else! This was a HUGE waste of money!!!"
5,GREAT TO WORK WITH!,"I love to Make Graphics, and one day I downloaded the Free Trail of this. Even though I havent really bought it yet, its FANTASTIC to work with and its better than any other online computer graphic designer out there!"
5,This is a great seller,As I am learning to do clip art from my own artwork for embroidery digitizers my mentor suggested this program. Well the seller provided me with exactly what I needed in great condition and it was all it was advertised to be. He is trustworthy and I most definitely suggest you consider him when making purchases.
2,A bit dissapointed...,"Perhaps it's the fact that I owned Adobe Photoshop 7 before I bought this software, but I noticed nothing unique about it. Only reason I can find to buy Paint Shop Pro 7 would be the cheaper price tag."
4,Great Graphics Software!,"I have both PSP 7 and Photoshop Elements and I far prefer PSP 7. However, both programs have their limitations, so I do occasionally switch back and forth between the two. I love to make banners in PSP. It's a piece of cake, especially after you figure out how to make your own tubes. Plus, PSP 7 comes with animation shop that alows you to make your own web animations. I have used Adobe Photoshop Deluxe as well (which they replaced with Photoshop Elements), but for making graphics and animations, PSP is far better. However, I do prefer Adobe Photoshop Deluxe (NOT Elements) for photo editing."
4,Does everything and then some.,"I purchased this item after talking to several people. It will do basically everything. The only drawback to this product is that it is very advanced. For someone like me who has never had a photo editing program, I'm finding it difficult to find the ""quick fix"" for my photos. Oh, and the manual is one and a half inches thick and makes for some very dull reading."
4,Terrific Software,The first thing I was thankful for when I open the box was a User Manual. I am frustrated when I buy software and all there is the CD. The animation and photo shop are definitely worth the price.
4,EXCELLENT STABILITY; EXCELLENT VALUE.,"By any means, ""Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7.0"" is a nice imaging tool. This continuity software showcased those genes, which enabled its earlier versions win numerous awards. Apart from being easy-to-deploy and use, it has excellent stability. Its enhanced features ensured that it is highly productive. Web-designers would appreciate the inclusion of JavaScript rollovers, and several other web-imaging tools in this '7.0 Pro' version.However, versatile image-editors should note that this 'Paint Shop' does not have the advanced premium features, which are evident in both 'Adobe Photoshop' and 'Corel Photo-Paint' programs. Still, its value-for-money did exceed those of 'Photoshop' and 'Photo-Paint'."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I would not give this a single star; I downloaded this a while ago and the only useful thing it did was replace colors, and it wasn't until after a month I finally figured out how to draw (and I'm not the worst at computers). When I tried to uninstall the thing, I found out that it messes with file extensions; meaning that normal files like jpegs no longer worked. The proper way to associate with files, by the way, is through remote addresses, meaning it should not open using the program, but the program should instead open the file. This is something even the inventors of MS Paint knew, and Paint is considered the worst (actually I like Paint, but that's besides the point).Don't misunderstand, JASC is normally a good thing to have on your computer, but the fact that it associated itself was annoying as anything."
2,Not a user-friendly piece of software,"This product is very awkward to use. It's hard to manipulate images, and you usually don't get what you expect. I would not recommend it."
3,Beware,"Recieved package and it had been opened, the cd was not wrapped, which leads one to believe it was a return or used.."
2,Horrible Interface,"There's an old adage about software:1. Cheap2. Powerful3. Easy to usePick any two. :-)With PSP 7.0 you get 1 & 2. The interface is so clunky that I went quickly looking for something easier to use. Just trying to do something simple, like draw a button with some text on it, is very frustrating (I gave up after two hours). Trying to make a gif transparent is also baffling at times, meaning sometimes it works -- and sometimes it doesn't. And the 3rd party tutorials out there are of little help, at least the ones that I've seen.PSP does pack some powerful features, however. And some of these are surprisingly easy to use, e.g., the Enhance Photo options. Rotating images is a snap to use too.If you have a good PSP teacher standing by, this would be a great program to buy. But unless you've had some experience with other graphics programs you won't get very far on your own trying to learn this one."
5,Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7.0 Anniversary Edition,"This is the best Paint software, I have every used. One key factor is the support given by Jasc. This price does not indicte the extra you will receive."
5,PSP RULEZ!!!,"My fave program!! I downloaded the free trial version and I honestly don't know what to do when it's over because I, being a 12 year old girl, DON'T HAVE that much money!! *sobs*"
3,new is not always better,"Just purchased paintshop pro 7.0.The product is quite helpful but appears to do less than the 5.0 version and is more complicated as well. With 5.0, you could ""click"" on ""browse"" and get thumbnail prints.The same process results in NOTHING with version 7.0.A new box and a higher price does little to make up for the fact that this version is clearly inferrior to it's predicessors.I consider my money wasted. The 5.0 version was far better."
1,Too Difficult For a Beginner,"This is the most frustrating program that I have ever used. I am not a photographer, nor a graphic artist, but am trying to build some graphics for a web page. I had been using the Microsoft product...and was able to create images with relative ease, considering my zero experience. i bought this product, however, and have found myself pulling out my hair.Bottom line- if you don't know what a ""raster layer"" is, don't buy this product."
4,Affordable Graphics Software Packed With Power!,"Few times in life do you feel you truly got what you paid for after you get it home. This is one of those. If you have used ANY other graphics software, you will probably not need to use the book or on-board ""help"" as much as you'd think. It's very user friendly.I was able to totally restore a valued photograph that had been both creased and loaded with water spots to the point that you can tell. I was able to repair all the damage and produce a picture on my computer. You can retouch any image and do all the tricks that you thought was reserved for those $5-600 programs."
5,Excellent program!,"I've thoroughly enjoyed Paintshop Pro 7.0. I hear that Jasc no longer owns PS Pro and the new version isn't as good at 7.0. I just LOVE the way I can do anything Photoshop does in about 1/10th the time and better output. While my friends are searching for plugins and arguing about what techniques to use, my Paintshop Pro comes fully loaded and does so much with a few simple clicks. Everyone just assumes I'm a Photoshop expert but my secret is Paintshop Pro! Even if you're new to graphics & photo editing give it a shot... it's EASY and professional! Just think of all the money you'll save over Photoshop!"
3,This game is not that bad...,"Wew, as far as I have seen....the another review is not complete yet,he doesn't know the game completely and even me,I haven't find all the secrets.What does he know about this game? This game has variety of Character.And also variety of Magics,and variety of monsters.Although the graphic is a little bit stupid,but the fun comes from playing and venturing together.The musics also not bad.The Items,You can't find all of them even in a full month.Unlike the Bof3,Suikoden2,FF8 he recommended,this game can play multiple player(up to 4 player!).maybe he only plays by himself and using warrior/dwarf that can't use magics.So he find the game boring."
3,Good...but not better...,"If you were waiting for Ray to be untethered creatively from the rounded edges that make up the Indigo Girls releases, then ""Stag,"" Ray's first solo release, will leave you well satisfied. This second solo release from Ray, ""Prom,"" while much edgier than IG material, lacks the focus and poignancy of Stag and gets a little more political, but all in all, it's still a very good effort.It's worth buying for the artwork alone. Check out Ray dressed as a cheerleader. Her expression is classic."
5,Great stuff,"I started reading Dion Fortune 35+ yrs ago. This book tells lots about the behind the scenes about Fortune & her Magickal group. Richardson was not a member of her order who had to dig for his facts ...and dig he did. The bock contains the Magickal records of 2 major members Christine Hartley & Charles Seymour. It talks about Fortune's true inner plane contacts as well as the entities invoked and mediated by the entire Lodge. The book also goes into the fact that Fortune sacrificed here inner plane contacts due to the publication of her seminal work ""the mystical Qabalah,"" whereupon she had to develop new inner plane contacts. This book is well worth the read."
4,Lives up to the title,"Definitely a voyeuristic pleasure, this book will appeal to any fan of 'list books', and anyone who wants to know which movie stars showed their naughty bits in which movies. It goes beyond that, of course, to reveal info on just about every 'dirty pleasure' to be offered by the movies: serial killers, masturbation scenes, and any number of other naughty kinks. My only quibble is the fact that the edition hasn't been updated since 1994."
4,GUY AND RALNA ALWAYA GREAT,THIS CD IS VERY GOOD AND THE SONGS ARE DONE BEAUTIFULY! THE SOUND ISN'T AS GOOD BECAUSE OF THE AGE OF THIS ALBUMN. I HAPPEN TO LOVE THIS CD AND ALSO OWN A CASSETTE OF IT. BUY IT! YOU WILL GET GREAT JOY FROM HEARING IT.
4,Essential for anyone who is looking for the details of WWII,"This book is aptly titled; it consists almost entirely of tables listing every statistical detail about World War II. Want to know what Bulgaria's order of battle was? Need to know how many aircraft carriers Japan build during the war? The range of Soviet tactical bombers? It's all here. On the other hand, there is little narrative, and the book assumes a detailed knowledge of World War II. However, you will not find so much information collected in one place anywhere else. Definitely not for everyone, but very valuable for anyone who wants to know (sometimes obscure) facts about the War. The one weakness of the book, as has been pointed out, is the absence of citation to primary authorities."
2,Buzz Magnets,"The first time my daughter used these they broke!!!! She threw them in the air (not high mind you) and accidentally didn't catch them and they fell on the sidewalk and they broke in half!!! Needless to say she was very disappointed!!!! Wouldn't buy this shape again, I might buy the round ones for her but not this shape."
5,Good Westin step bars,"These were bought to replace my passenger step bar that lost in a fight between my originals and a boulder. They bolt right in, were priced right and have been on a year without showing any blemishes."
1,They didn't fit but the replacements did!,"The Westin 23-1680 step bars do not fit the 2011 Silverado LT. Although listed by Amazon as the correct rail, Westin web site shows the Westin 23-1950 as the correct rail for the 2011 Silverado LT. I sent the first ones back and will report when the correct ones arrive.The 23-1950 Westin Side rails arrived and fit perfectly on the 2011 Silverado LT. Amazon you need to change your recommendation on this particular rail. After 30 minutes both rails were on, fit perfectly and make my truck look Great!"
3,A wonderful reminiscence...,"Laurie Harper had her hands full with this one. How do you describe Don Sherwood's ""naughty"" laugh, or the leer in his voice, or the effect that Sherwood had on his listeners in San Francisco? It wasn't easy, but Harper did an admirable job, rounding up Don's friends, colleagues and admirers -- including Herb Caen, Russ Couglin, and her husband, the pioneer of airborne traffic reporters, Hap Harper -- and crafted a book that captures much of the flavor and feel of an era that has sadly passed: San Francisco in the late 'Fifties and early 'Sixties, an era to which Sherwood and his KSFO colleagues (Jack Carney, Del Courtney, Al Collins, Buddy Hatton, Gene Nelson, Terry McGovern, Carter B. Smith, Aaron Edwards) provided the soundtrack."
5,Super listening,"The CD brings back *the* jazz accordionist of the 50's and 60's. Too many people dismiss the accordion as a toy, but in talented hands, it is a very much a musical instrument. Give it a listen and get ready for fun."
5,A masterful accordianist,"If you enjoy listening to a master accordianist and the other musicians who made up the Art Van Damme Qunitet: a vibraphonist, a bassist, a guitarist and a drummer, you definitely will enjoy this CD:""The Art Van Damme Sound: Martini Time"". The selections played are what I would call ""standards""; some might call them ""oldies"". I heard these on the radio in my youth: the 1950's and '60's, enjoyed them then and still do. When I heard an interview with Mr. Van Damme on a local NPR talk show:""Insight"" on KXJZ, broadcasting from CSU Sacramento, and listened to excerpts from his ""heyday"" performances, I looked for and found this and another CD on Amazon.com They are wothwhile buys.Riccardo Giuseppi"
2,New Age,"Sorry I just couldn't get into this one, so I carn't really review it because I didn't finish reading it."
1,the College Board Scholarship handbook 2007,"you can do much better on Fastweb and it is free.the book is not well organized, and I got a headache trying to figure out what we qualify for. buy it used or better yet go to the library."
5,My first favorite book for cooking Chinese food!,"Although I have found other books which are nearly as good, this one has been my favorite for several years. The recipes inside mainly have a southern Chinese cooking style and require a fair amount of preparation time (at least if you follow the recipes to the letter). However, I have yet to find a recipe which did not end up in a delicious meal.Like most good Chinese recipe books, the initial sections describe Chinese ingredients (this one lacks pictures) and food preparation techniques (this book contains very nice photo illustrations).The subsequent chapters are organized by entree type (poultry, beef, etc.). Each recipe has a cooking difficulty rating, number served, total preparation/cooking time, and well organized ingredient lists and preparation/cooking instructions.Although this book has been out of print for over five years, it's still available used."
4,Great product but............,"This is a great product but it has one flaw. The dock does not have enough tension on it so sometimes when you turn on the Visor it will freeze. The lock is not keeping it locked into place. This is my second one with the same problem. The solution is two pieces of double edge tape in the top. This provides enough tension. I have had no problems since installing the ""fix""."
1,Horrible product,"I had high hopes for this product. I wasn't interested in a portable keyboard, just a case. However the keyboard was a nice touch. Sadly I had a difficult time finding the driver on the CD-ROM (I have a Mac, and the CD is for Windows people). Fellowes tech support finally told me where it was -- turns out the manual that comes with the case was totally mistaken.The bigger problem is that I only got the product to work once. After that I could bang on the keys all day and nothing would happen. Save your money and buy a real keyboard if you need one. Stay away from this item."
3,Gun is somewhat difficult to load,The gun was shipped fast and is fine it is just a bit difficult to keep the ammo in the gun.
2,disapointed,this gun works but its far from great please dont buy this gun and for that matter dont buy any double eagle guns because they all suck. pros: lots of attachments works cons: extremely cheap plastic horrible range and fps only holds 45 bbs final verdict: piece of crap dont buy this gun. but i do know that the cyma galil is great
2,Cheesy Gun,"An ok gun, I guess. Ithas pretty good accuracy, and the red dotsight is helpdul. The stock broke after 2 weeks. I dropped it in my yard and it snapped right off.Pros- Good acccuracy; lare clip capacity, bullets line up with laser pointer; and it looks realistic.Cons- It takes forever to load (I recomend getting a speedloader); the red dot sight is hard to attatch and it is wobbly; and it is a cheap plastic.It came with a paper for 5,000 free BBs if you give it a 5 star review, which is crap because they all ready know the reviews will be bad"
5,Highly Recomended!,This is hands down the best airsoft gun i have ever owned. it is a must by for anyone who loves airsoft!
1,You get what you pay for,I got this in the mail and it is not the same as the one in the pictures. Does not hold a 300 bb mag and it is awful. This gun is an m83 not what is listed as a m16 or m4. Comes with all the stuff but cheap and plastic. You get what you pay for I guess. SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a good quality one because returns are horrible with this seller. They want you to pay for shipping this back which cheapest is $11.00 and I had to open a claim because they wanted to charge me an additional 10% restocking fee?? Why should I have to pay them for their mistake? DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Nothing Navy About It,"This is not the gun that the listing describes. It is not a ""Navy Commando"" anything and can be bought for much less. Save your money."
4,review,first of all this is a great gun it comes with lots of things like laser strap flash light red dot sight it has about 250 fps could be like 300 im not surepeople who say if sucks and has all that bull. their wrong they expect to get a great gun for 30 buks if you want a good one buy the ones that are 150 buks if not suck it up and deal with it
4,Great for 1st Airsoft,Great first airsoft. Accuracy is off. I am an experienced shooter and find the accuracy is lacking with this airsoft. Otherwise very good item.
1,Waste,Only works with the BB's supplied. Doesn't fire any other BB's. Company hasn't responded to my messages and it's been a week. Don't waste your money and get burned like I did.
3,Just an M83,"First of all, this is nothing more than a Double Eagle M83, is seems a little misleading to call it a ""Navy Commando."" It is an okay gun, and the accessories are cool.ProsComes with a lot of accessories, looks coolConsLow FPSOne low-cap magazinePS: My gun arrived several days late"
1,Poor customer service and poor quality gun - not sure which is worse,"I ordered this for my son for his birthday. Extremely poor quality plastic - shattered upon a slight impact. Several emails back and forth between the Hit Import Toys and still no refund after first agreeing to exchange 3 times with no follow up email, then stating I would receive a refund. You guessed it - nothing! Filed a complaint with credit card company. There are several other companies who sell air-soft. Don't waste your time or money with this one."
4,Amazing,"When my son bought this book from the author's younger brother, I was skeptical, even though it received good reviews from the 8th graders. Then my husband, a discriminating reader, read it and enjoyed it; so I knew I had to see whether a teenager could write about grief and keep the interest of this middle-aged woman. She did and I think it is amazing. I didn't put the book down until I was finished. The characters were well-developed and the plot held together."
2,Dig a Big Pit,"At last a Jam album to pretty much avoid, 'Dig the New Breed' is horror versions of your favourite Jam songs played lacklustre fashion in venues like Hammersmith Palais and Edinburgh Playhouse.Imagine listening to fuzzy, out of tune interpretations with a bit of muffled crowd roar and an aeroplane starting up in the back of the hangar and you've got 'Dig the New Breed'.An appallingly condescending selection; singles, couple tracks from each album, one 'exclusive' song - a cover version of 'Big Bird' (No? Me neither) so the completists need buy it. All bases covered in relentlessly avaricious and insultingly contrived fashion.So how about it pop-kids - come and get your souvenir live Jam album to commemorate the lousy farewell tour.Sound much like Weller?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This is probably the worst calculus book I have ever seen. Proofs and examples are often cut short with multiple lines of calculations left out. The text is nearly impossible to understand and presented in such a way that it is unappealing to the reader. The entire book is in black and white and seems as though it is very out of date. Although it is dealing with a tough topic, this book does a terrible job of explaining concepts."
3,Performance 5...Presentation 1,This is like a bad dream...on the shelf is a DVD of a concert only a lucky few got to attend..classic music of my generation ..and treated with very cool approaches which allmost all succeed..NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS..Platinum has rushed it into the marketplace without viewing the darned thing..there are MANY digital artifacts (I don't know the technical terms for glitches in the picture) which are distracting. I must add that it plays differently on my two DVD players..maybe one is able to read it better? BOTTOM LINE...I still watch it more than most of my 100+ discs..so why can't they take the time to make them right?
2,Won't get fooled again,"The concert was clearly excellent, with Daltrey enjoying himself, but this DVD is a very poor record of it. The sound is simply the worst that I have ever heard on a sell through DVD. It sounded so bad that at first I thought my DVD player was faulty, but it sounded equally terrible in two other machines. At times the soundtrack is plainly out of sync with the visuals. Given the long string of technical credits at the end it is all the more surprising that something this bad got pressed up and sold. Worth having as a curiosity to sit alongside the bootlegs, but only if the price is as low as the quality."
3,Roger Daltry - A celebration,"The content is great the sound quality is very poor and camera work is not much better, This soundtrack needs post production work. The program editing left a lot to be desired. I have been listening to the Who for the last 30 years and this DVD has let them down badly. I am sure that Roger and the other artists can't be happy with end result. Help!"
1,"Spirit 4 stars, video and audio quality 1 star","This is incredibly bad in terms of video and audio quality. In stark contrast try out John Fogerty's Premonition, Fleetwood Mac Dance, Eagle's Hell Freezes Over, Either Bee Gees CD. We as customers need to send a strong message to both those that produce quality products (some examples listed above) and those that are like the General Motor's of the world."
1,"Amazing show, Terrible quality","I was fortunate enought to attend this concert, and if you think about it, the sound at Carnagie Hall in NYC is world famous. And on this night, the acoustics of the hall lived up to the reputation. So, WHAT HAPPENED? Who dropped the ball?It's New York City, you have at your disposal the finest most up-to-date technical equipment available anywhere. You are recording in a hall that is acoustically perfect as you can get, and the end result is THIS LOUSY DVD?All in attendance were in awe of the performence that night. We are equally in awe over how this could be the end result of such an amazing event. Pathetic."
2,Roger Daltry:'A Celebration-With Pete Townsend..'(Compendia),"Who finalized the authoriziation of this DVD for public sales?Whoever it was,he/she MUST'VE been half asleep.The sound quality of this DVD is terrible.Even with Daltry belting out such Who goods as ""You Better,You Bet"",""I Can See For Miles"",""I'm Free"" among others doesn't even come close to making up for the fact this DVD should NOT be bought for any MORE than,say $5.00 if you happen to find it in a cut-out bid."
2,Won't be missed,"I will give Bodum points (and the additional star here) for being early in the game with double-walled glass, but my original set of these is down to 1, and I can't say I'll miss it much when (not if) it goes.I like:+ double-walled glass looks cool; Shows the ""guinness effect"" in a good espresso like no other+ they're not quite as pricey as the used to beNo likey:- insulating ability doesn't really improve on a properly warmed ceramic cup- glue over the hole in bottom is NOT dishwasher safe...I don't care what they say- no design-savvy brand should let silkscreened text like that out the door. I mean, c'mon- Like all Bodum double walls, they're thin. Maybe this helps cut head conductance, but to me feels fragile (and had proven so)- I just don't get the shape. It reminds me of the car mugs made to fit in small cupholdersEspecially in light of the Sun's Tea glasses I just got, I think there is much better to be had now, and likely for less money."
4,Wish they nested,"These glasses are terrific for keeping shots of espresso warm while you steam milk. I've tried steaming the milk first, but there are usually too many distractions. I love everything about them. However, it would be helpful if they nested. That's the only reason I didn't give them five stars."
1,makes a nice mini terrarium now,"i bought a set of four of these for my husband for christmas. within two months, two of them lost their little rubber plugs from the bottom, and now water is trapped between the glass. i looked online and did not see other complaints of this nature, and we otherwise love these glasses, so i figured this must just be a rare double fluke. i emailed bodum directly to see if they would at least replace them. that was about four weeks ago, and they have not bothered to respond."
2,Don't waste your money,"Not tall enough for my nepresso latte and doesn't stay hot like advertised. INO this is a waste of money, get a large shot glass for your espresso. I don't like it."
4,Great Expresso Glasses,"Great little 3 oz Expresso Glasses (set of 2). I agree with the other reviewers that I would not place these in the dishwasher although the packaging says they are dishwasher safe. They have a plastic/rubber clear plug in the bottom which will keep water from leaking in when washing by hand, but I would be concerned about that plug leaking some water which as others have indicated would get trapped between the two layers of glass. These look stylish, and keep my Expresso hot but glass is cool to the touch. Each time I make myself or a visitor an Expresso in these cups, I feel like a diva. Totally stylish, plus a pleasure to drink from."
4,Great Vocab,"Good book with a lot of vocab for middle schoolers. The book is a low cost edition, the print is just okay"
4,kissology vol. 2,"This is a great item for any kiss fan to have in their collection. However the product had smashed corners on the box when I received it, which I was not happy about. This volume of the three part set gives you great insight to why peter and ace were no longer in the kiss line up, and how the band lost some of its popularity in the 80's. This is a must own for any true kiss fan."
3,"Good, but coulda been better","I was a Kiss fan in the 70's, so I go way back. The problem I had with this DVD is that it is mostly all concert footage. I like to see documentary type stuff also. Backstage footage, interviews, background, new insights. You get none of that here. A highlight is Gene Simmons appearing on a 70's talk show in full makeup and costume, and a short story about Kiss visiting a Michigan high school in 1975. Other than that, it is mostly just several hours of concert footage. Good DVD, but not great."
5,Kiss fans were waiting for that for decades,"This a dream came true for die hard kiss fans. If you are one of them, you know what I'm talking about. Just can't wait for the followings DVD in 2007.Maybe the concerts sound could be better improved with a little more digital technology, but it's OK."
5,Get them all,"I spent a few hours today between Circuit City, Best Buy, and Wal Mart. This is the truth and do it. Go to CC first, but it for $15.99. Take the flyer to Best Buy and price match it. Then go to Wal Mart and price match it as well. You will get each bonus disc. I just wonder....are there any other stores that have a bonus disc ??? Please respond if so. The VH1 Classic special is awesome with Mr Trunk...be sure to see it."
4,See what they were like when they were hungry.,"The box set is a fantastic way to show how good they were in the early days. I like all sorts of different stages of Kiss' evolution, but to see them play live in 75 at San Francisco's Winterland was a real treat. Anyone who has a problem with Peter's drumming, watch it here - this is what he was like before the drugs completely took over.There are also extras like the first ever live shot of them playing at the Coventry, and again at Ace's wedding. Being from England, I also like the tv show that covered their first tour here in 1976.The only reason I have gone for 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the typical way that they marketed it. Amazon had a bonus disc of Madison Sq Gdn, Walmart had Largo, and Best Buy had another show. So typical of Kiss these days to bleed their loyal fans dry."
1,Call Jimmy Page and ask for advice...,"I've seen better quality from a flea market. Remastered? Crap. Led Zep's stuff is older, and the quality came out tons better. My portable AM/FM radio sounds better than this. Money wasted..."
5,Great dvd collection,"This is the first dvd in the amazing series of kissology from 1974-1977. It has great ace guitar solos and great peter drumming. P.S. check out the guitar solo on shock me from the love gun tour. Well here is what's on the dvd.Disc 1. ""Acrobat""""abcs in concert: nothin to lose,firehouse,black diamond.""Midnight Special"": she/black diamond"" Kiss promo clips: c'mon and love me/ rock n roll all nite""Cobo Hall""Disc 2. ""so it goes""""Budokan Hall""""don k's rock concert""""Summit""And that concludes the amizing debut of the kissology series,buy this!!!"
3,5 Stars except for Best Buy's Version,"Buyer beware: if you purchase your copy from Best Buy the bonus disc contains no menu, nor does it allow you to track from song to song. I would have been better off simply transfering my old VHS to dvd than buying this. I chose to drive an extra forty minutes simply to have THIS extra show on dvd - and I'm taking it back tonight.As for the previous reviewer who wondered why the Cobo Hall show is in the set twice (for Best Buy purchases)... it's not. It's the previous night's performance."
2,IS THIS AS GOOD AS IT GETS?,"I saw Kiss for the first time in 1978. What a stage show! and that is why it is such a shame the footage doesn't look and sound better on this set. It's pretty low grade and it should not be the case. If they only had the forthought back then to record these shows better. It's hard to believe the members of Kiss did not realize how important good quality footage would be now! These guys spent so much money on fantastic stage shows and then they forgot to record the shows with top quality cameras? If these shows had been professionally done they would have sold 100 times over this release. I'm glad I have it but, it should have been so much better!For Kiss fans this is a must buy, but be prepared for some disappointment in quality. As most fans know there are different bonus discs included for Wal-Mart and Target, also a third disc for all other chain stores. They are only included in the initial release."
4,Kissology,"Early concert footage when the band was raw and hungry, dark and dangerous. Kiss fans will enjoy this DVD as you will feel like you have scene a kiss concert from the early years. Non-Kiss fans will get a sense of why this band became and institution. They have digitaly remastered to the best they can, I suspect, the quality of the film and sound is decent but not great. One problem is its mostly the same songs over and over for each concert. Overall, well put together, good packaging, and good product. Its comically how Gene Simmons is still recycling this same material making money off the first 3 years of the band."
3,Fair to Middlin',"I'll support what another reviewer wrote: the sound is a big disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much, maybe I was spoiled by the Led Zeppeelin DVD that actually has great sound. The sound on this DVD is not a step up from the bootlegs I have heard before. The video looks better, some of the extras are very nice but if you are getting this just for a bump up in audio, keep watching your old bootlegs, this DVD is no improvement."
3,KISS falls short for diehard fans...but good enough for others,"I have seen most of this before it was released and I will say the 5.1 mix is weak! The transfers could have been better on some but I know it comes down to the original sources and that's where you're slave to what you have to work with.They are many more concerts that I have seen before not included on this disc set...why did KISS picked these shows?I wish there were more commentary to this...that's what KISS fans want to know...what were you thinking and what was happening to them right then. what was available was cool...alot of it is printed in the booklet insert.How about some commentaries from Peter & Ace?Having seen KISS many times and worked for a venue that hosted a KISS concert, I must say that the excitement was not even close to what they could have offered to KISS fans.but this disc set will be in my collection... because KISS was all that!"
3,KISSOLOGY Gets Good Grade,"I'd have to say that overall, this is excellent. Some of the footage is screwed up and some didn't have proper sound, so for this, it loses a few points. However, this highlights some of the best sounds of the band's entire career. Get this if you want to see the band in their prime."
2,Not a cure all for everyone,"The book does have some helpful tidbits, but the overall tone that ""this will work for all chidren"" is overly confident. Not a bad idea to skim it if you are reading everything written on the subject, but there are better books out there."
4,Excellent step-wise approach,"As a pediatrician, I'm asked discipline questions every day. This is a fine book which takes a step-wise approach to improving your relationship with your child - especially a child who is difficult to discipline. Our 5 year old is strong-willed and tempermental and we were able to use this approach very succesfully - without spanking! Parents are given assignments to complete & are to focus on only one thing a week - & practice it every day. I appreciate the fact that after the end of the 1st week parents usually end up appreciating their own child much more - noticing good behavior more and focusing in on that rather than dwelling on the irritating behaviors. This book is very good for parents who are very motivated to change, not for ones looking for a quick fix - I promise, there is none. I would also recommend 123 Magic and Dr. Sears' book ""The Discipline Book"" - they are highly recommended in my practice every day."
5,Immediate results,"This is one amazing book. I've recommended it to just about every parent I know, especially ones having problems with their child. Most parents want to be good parents. Not all parents know how.I was at my wit's end with my then 5 year old. When I was done with the book, I found myself with a sweet little boy. What a difference parenting style can make.Parenting the Strong-Willed Child doesn't just tell us what we know (positive reinforcement, consistency, etc.), it teaches how to do it right. It is a five week program, and if you're dedicated, it will work. I decided I was going to do it exactly as prescribed and I saw results from the very first week. In fact, each week, I noted improvement and that was what motivated me to finish the program.This program is well worth the effort and cost. I am forever grateful to the authors who helped me completely change my relationship with my child."
5,Intriguing & Interesting Read,"After the last couple of crappers I've read, this book was like a cool breeze on a hot day. Snappy writing, interesting characters, great plot, funny repartee--what more can you ask for? Love this author and plan to read more Stuart Hoag books based on my excellent experience with this one."
5,Handler is a scream.,Handler is a scream. His stories are orginal and his characters are very lively. No trends are spared from Handler's savage pen. I hope Handler enjoys writing the Hoagy series as much as I enjoy reading it
5,Love Lulu,"Another fun read with great characters. I especially love Lulu,the bassett hound. Good plot and gray places visited. The Bee and Thistle was a great bed and breakfast and I loved going there when I lived in East Haddam. Have fun with this fun novel."
2,Didn't get a chance!,"WE didn't even get a chance to try out the waterpik shower massager because as we were assembling it, the cheap plastic screw-cap split in two! We were hopeful and anticipating great showers with this new product, but within just hours of opening it as a present on Christmas morning and attempting to get it hooked up, it was broken and in the trash. So sad! I'm just glad it was only $20. It would probably be a good idea for the manufacturer to at least make the screw portion of the shower head in chrome as well as the sprayer and use minimal plastic, if any at all."
3,Just not what I hoped for,"I have two sons, aged 3 and 4. They like the games. I was looking for a computer game to practice letter recognition and letter sounds, and I would not choose this set again. The Caillou disc is one they enjoy, with lots of games(one for each letter) also shape and color games. I wish that Caillou would say the name of the letter each time my son clicks on it. It's silent; so other than making him LOOK at the letters, it doesn't really help with pre-reading skills. There's a Muppet Babies disc that they also enjoy but that one is all games for fun. Also, these are not new games with spiffy graphics. Three of the other discs were slow and a bit clunky (Zaboomafoo, BoohBah, Land Before Time). There are five (?) more discs in the box we haven't tried, so maybe the one I am hoping for will still appear."
2,Don't buy this version,"Sadly, this CD fails to live up to expectations. A film of an enormously sucessful Broadway and West End musical must have sounded like a good idea at the time, but as this CD testifies, it was not well executed. Many of the songs have been cut, and those that remain are poorly orchestrated. The highlight of the disc, and the reason for two stars is the instumental 'Chase' and playoff at the end, as well the signature number 'Comedy Tonight!', which are nice to listen to.While the performances are not bad, neither are they particularly good, which means that the recording lacks the particular feeling of farce that is necessary for the show to work as a recording.If you want a recording, then get either the OBC or the recent Broadway revival cast: both of which are superior in almost every respect."
4,Entertaining,"I'm not a Broadway purist. I enjoy this CD more than the (recent) Broadway Cast album. Yes, many of the original songs are missing, but some of the missing songs just weren't that good--I've reached the point where I skip several when playing the CD. I enjoy the instrumental parts of the movie soundtrack and, for the songs which are left, I find the orchestrations better as well as the singing voices of the cast. I can't say how it compares to the original Broadway Cast album since, when I ordered that, I just got a second copy of the more recent one."
1,DON'T BOTHER!,"The score was reduced to 5 songs - all of them poorly sung (and badly orchestrated!) The sound on the CD is just as bad as the old U.A. Lp editions .... which is to say just awful! There is no need for this album to have been released on CD at all!If you want the score of FORUM go for either the original cast (Zero Mostel) or the 1996 revival cast (Nathan Lane.) Either version is much more enjoyable listening! (The British cast led by Frankie Howard was out on EMI's West End Angel label, but it is now out of print. While not as good as the 2 Broadway casts it is still miles ahead of this recording!)I can't stress stongly enough... DON'T BUY THIS VERSION!!!!"
3,THE MUTINY ON BOARD H.M.S. BOUNTY by William Bligh,"This is William Bligh's personal account of the mutiny on board the H.M.S. Bounty in 1789. The first half of the account concerns the Bounty's travels among the islands, interactions with the indigenous peoples, and the transportation of breadfruit plants. These portions are quite often boring, as they get bogged down in mundane detail and nautical jargon. The account of the mutiny itself is extremely short. But the second half of the novel, Bligh's 3600 mile journey in an open boat, is gripping and astounding.Bligh's account, while more or less fair, is nevertheless one-sided. And dispute over what kind of man he was persist. If you are looking for a complete and accurate account of the mutiny in one volume, this is not it, although it is a valuable part of any such research.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"
4,Thorough,"This biography is very thorough, especially on Peck's acting career. As for the personal life, Fishgall gives the facts but doesn't delve into any sticky, emotional relationships if, indeed, there were any.The acting career, however, is covered in great detail from the very beginning, so if you're more interested in the actor and the public man than in the inner man, you'll enjoy this book. I did."
5,A Towering Star,"There is a scene in ""The Old Gringo"" where Gregory Peck as the title character tries to seduce spinsterish Jane Fonda with words words words. (Actually, it turned out he was only softening her up for the young Mexican general Jimmy Smits.)The Old Gringo talks about all the beautiful women he's loved over his long life and how he made them sigh into his mustache. Oh yes, we can believe it! Think of Gregory as the cynical reporter who falls in love with Audrey Hepburn in ""Roman Holiday""; or the lewd cowboy Lewt McCandles, who drives Jennifer Jones' Pearl to a ""Duel in the Sun""; or the bewildered amnesia patient who makes Ingrid Bergman's cool psychologist fall madly in love in Hitchcock's ""Spellbound."" I thoroughly enjoyed reading Gary Fishgall's well-researched biography of this towering actor, who is just as decent and intelligent as we always imagined."
3,Fishgall's least impressive work,"I generally enjoy Fishgall's work, but this one doesn't seem to cut the mustard as much as the others did. You can tell as you read along Fishgall is infatuated by his subject, and that's no way to write, unless one is writing about a family member. He obviously idolized Peck, and it shows. His research is good, but for such idolatry to swho through is unprofessional.Head `Em Off At the Pass!: 94 Westerns You Should Watch"
1,A detailed review,"For designers:1. These setup only allows you to turn on so many fonts and isnt very helpful in viewing other fonts you may have from the font management program with this.2. I went in and checked, there isnt really 3000 fonts, its like 2900 something, so... you decide.3. Its way to over priced for what you get. If you buy the new CorelDraw x4, it comes with a font management program already.4. It takes forever to try and remove all the fonts, it sometimes hides the files for individual viewing."
3,Fonts,It did not really provide what I was looking for very well: calligraphic fonts. There were some script fonts that I liked.
2,Boring,"The first 4 years of imaginative and action-packed B&W episodes were much better. This final color season (expanded from 30 to 60 minutes) was a disappointment. The combination of a recurring supporting cast (who frequently over-acted), the tiring backdrop of Jim Hardy's ranch & nearby town, and a drawn-out (sometimes silly) story-line resulted in a boring TV experience. I devoured the B&W boxed set of earlier episodes, but couldn't get past the first two discs here. Even Dale Robertson (whom I love) couldn't rescue the series. Sorry, my expectations were much higher."
4,Tales of Wells Fargo,"The whole set was good, maybe a little drawn-out due to the hour length, but still a good trip back to the days of old TV westerns(horse operas) as I call them, and worth taking."
2,Tales of Wells Fargo Color Season,"It is a shame that they spoiled a great western series with this format. The original series was one of the greatest westerns ever produced. The stories from the color season was mixed with things that had no business being in there. All the stories seened to drag on due to the hour format and the larger cast. It would have been better to show the Jim Hardie homelife now and then but not every week. The took the original producer, writers, and directors out of the loop."
3,"DVD's Good, 3 Cases Not Good !","The 3 Cases that the 6 DVD's came in were All Damaged.The 3 prongs and their middle ""Button"" to release each Disc were broken and these pieces,along with the DVD's fell out when opened!The plastic is dry and Brittle,most likely because they are old cases.It would not be to bad if I paid $4.00 for these but $39.99, NO, it is to much to pay for broken cases. The DVD's are fine but now I have to purchase more Cases.By the Way, this did not happen during shipping, I checked the outside and inside of ""Blister Bag"" and the bag was in perfect condition!It seems to Me that these cases were stored for years in a warm facility!"
3,Two different formats,"For the most part I have enjoyed this product. However, of the six disks, disk 3 and disk 6 do not run on my DVD Player (DVD Player is 3 months old and firmware is current). I have had to go to my computer which reads all formats go watch these disks. Big difference in 50"" and 15"".Jim T."
2,Buy it if......,"With this you may help your CD's but lets face it everyone has its CDs dirty and it will still be usefull. Buy it if you really need it, if you don't need it dont waste your money."
1,Duped!,"I was duped. I expected this to be a book. My daughter loves Junie B., so it is fine, but I did notice that it is a size 10/12! Sigh. I guess she can sleep in it. Just wanted to give a heads up. I am laughing about it....now."
5,Great product for the Junie B. Fan,I bought this as a surprise gift for my 6 year old daughter after she sucessfully read an entire Junie B. Jones book by herself. She was thrilled and wears it all the time. The quality of the t-shirt is very good. The image looks like it will fade pretty quickly. But I imagine it will work until she outgrows it. I recommend this product highly.
1,Poor product description,"Junie B. Jones: First Ever Junie B-Shirt (A Stepping Stone Book(TM))The product description says ""A Stepping Stone Book"" - I mistakenly thought it was an actual book. Not what I expected at all."
4,Special T-Shirt,Concerts have t-shirts why not books - Great way to advertise book and promote the Junie B. book collection. Thanks
2,Junie B Jones T Shirt,"We are big Junie B Jones Fans! Santa brought this T shirt this year. It is unique as there is no other Junie B Clothing however...It washes down to a small size 8, fades quite alot with the first washing and looks like a cheap little boy's under shirt .I was disappointed in the quality."
3,cute but big,"This is a really cute shirt but my six year old (she is small for her age, but...) ""swims"" in it. It's really big on her. I wish it came in different sizes!"
3,Junie B. Jones: First Ever Junie B-Shirt,"I thought I was ordering a book, and it was a t-shirt instead! Which was fine. My daughter loves it, and wears it everywhere. The shirt isn't anything special-pretty minimal in quality-but who cares. Its a cheap shirt that gets lots of love."
5,warriors ehould also heal,Very instructive book. Easy to follow instructions and a list of available stores which supply the herbs. I have my warrior tonic aging as I speak.
5,Ron Rhodes- Please do another one!!!,"This is by far the best Bible study I've ever done.It challenged, convicted and changed me.It has set me free to make decisions with out having to analyzeif I'm doing the right thing. It's Gods wisdom and judgement, not mans fuzzy thinking.Many Christians quote Proverbs 3:5-6 without consulting the rest of theproverbs, and end up making incredibly silly decisions,by ""not leaning on their own understanding""it's time to lean hard on Gods understanding of life decisions.Get the book! In all your getting, get wisdom, get understanding."
5,"Very practical, directive strategy","treating depression with cognitive therapy is often the way to go because it can assume a simple, practical format that can motivate patients to take one step at a time. depressed patients frequently feel lost and hopeless, and the directive approach that cognitive therapy takes can bring hope. this book offers many ideas for working with depressed patients in an organized, well-written format."
3,book,This is more of a text book than anything. Not a book for self help. It is a bit wordy and is sometimes needlessly convoluted.
4,I want more Michele Lee,"The sound quality of this disc is quite good, and it is an exact replica of the original 1967 LP. The song ""Coffee Break"" which was unwisely cut from the film is included here. Michele Lee is so good on ""I Believe In You"" and in her performance on film, that it is a real shame that her part and her character's songs were so badly minimized. As it stands, this is a very good soundtrack and the score is quite catchy. ""Been a Long Day"" and ""Brotherhood of Man"" are well performed and orchestrated, as are all of the numbers. A couple of bits of the underscoring are also included to round out this set."
3,"Go back to the book, J. Pierrepont","After working with Blue Eyes, Nelson Riddle got a suitably inflated impression of himself, and he took it out on one of Frank Loesser's best scores with a big dose of bombast. Why use understatement when you can have a symphonic orchestra doink and boink all over the place? That Riddle got himself in over his swelled head was no clearer than when he decided to replace the quote from Grieg's Piano Concerto in ""Rosemary"" with something better. As Pauline Kael said of Rex Harrison in the film version of My Fair Lady, everyone seems to have done this a million times already -- Rudy Vallee is in bad voice here -- but Robert Morse is Old Faithful, singing well if a bit too cuddly for a thirty-five-year-old. Like Rykodisc's other ""MGM"" albums, this is straight from the LP masters, complete in this case with truncated cues and not-quite-top-notch mixing. Stick with Victor's five-star '61 cast album.P. S. Was Robert Q. Lewis really as smarmy as I remember him?"
1,Worst Technical Book Ever,"This is the worst technical book I have ever read. The information is wrong in places. The information is far too abbreviated in the entire book. I would not even call this a book. Being very kind, I would call this a leaflet.Far too many fluff drawings, blank pages and repeated information. Specifically, this book advertises to have 192 pages, but only about 100 pages have relevant information; the last page number in this book is 167, which is at the end of the index. This is followed by 13 completely blank pages.If you want a book on XML, start with ""Beginning XML"" by David Hunter. It has all of the details that you need to understand XML. From there, you can tackle XSL, JDBC, etc."
3,Screeching Weasel adopts a FAT records sound,"Dont get me wrong, theres some decent stuff on this CD. But it isnt like their best stuff (Anthem For A New Tomorrow, for example). It is definiutley a CD with a distinct FAT-wreck chords sound to it. THey can do better."
2,Anthem For An Old Screeching Weasel,"I'm a huge SW fan, but this album really let me down. It does grow on you after a while, but it seems like they've lost the edge that made them so awesome back in the good ol' days (like when Anthem was released). The tracks almost seem stale, and they sound way too Fat for my liking..."
3,I miss the old Screeching Weasel,"Change the lineup, you'll change the sound. Although it wasn't necasarilly a bad change, I still can't help but miss the old SW. Granted, this does has it's share of good tunes, it just isn't what I remember them being.Don't get me wrong, although differnt, a great album nonetheless. I'm just prefer their older stuff more.If you're a Screeching Weasel fan, get it. If you're new to the band, start with Boogada Boogada Boogada."
4,"not SW's best, but better than the last few albums","This album shows Ben Weasel's ability to shift and change SW's sound with line-up changes. Not as poppy as most of their stuff, but just as snotty. Good driving rhythms and speed."
2,Disappointment,"I had very dry skin patches this winter, and when I read the information on this product I got excited, until I received it. It didn't help my dry skin at all despite applying it 2-3 times a day. Has a nice texture and smell to it, but it's definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it. Even using it in this spring, it hasn't made any difference in my skin texture."
5,Fantastic!,I was looking for a back pack to go on a 5 day-hike.It's a beautiful orange that enables you to spot your luggage right away. I was able to pack all the things that I needed. This back pack went through dirt and other things... It's very comfortable and resistant. I would buy it again if I had too.
1,Dragon Ball Z Final Bout,"Game received ,and is for Japan Playstations only. Would not work on Playstations sold in the U.S.A. This important bit of information was not presented at time of sale. Glad we did not wait for christmas morning to open this gift !"
5,DBGT block headed or just bad graphics?,"I've read many reviews of this game; some good, and some bad. Most of the complaints just rattle on and on about the bad graphics, I say get over it! Under the shell of old grphics lays a game with a tournement mode, a training mode and a vs. mode. When the game is first played there are only eight playable characters but playing through the tournement once unlocks everyone. If your a fan of the genre or of the series then I say get this game."
3,extremly garbage,"this game is real slow and requires a lot of skillz i got this game when it was 30.00 imported and 150.00 is just crazy. this game isnt worth that much. yea i admittt the game is real catchy to a dbz fanitics like i was when i was 8. and still i hated this game. and the game play is real slow and i wont recomend this because its as bad as walnuts but'll ill recomend to get the new dbz game even though i hate dbz, but the other game just kicks a$$"
4,dragonballgt is the bomb,"dragonballgt final bout rocks.i`m gonna get this game and i got the chet codes for the game.everyones my faviorte charater espicaily little goku,little super saiyan goku,adult goku dbz,adult goku dbgt,super saiyan goku,super saiyan2 goku dbz, super saiyan3 goku dbz,super saiyan4 goku dbgt and vagita"
2,Jeez...,"This is one bad game. Sure the fighting is excellent, but the character models suck. Freeza's head is the size of jupiter. The music ain't to awe-inspiring either. Gokuu's theme is a blatant rip off of Mission Impossible. Anyway, Buy this only if you are a hardcore DBZ/GT freak."
5,this game is the best,i do not have this game i do not no were you get this game can you tell me were you can buy this game ok.
2,Never should have been made......,Firt off I just want you to know that i love dbz and i would never right a bad review about it. until now.these are the goods1.Dragon BAll Z2.fight3.kamehameha!The BADs1.no plot at all2.takes about 1 hour to beat.3.voice actors arent on the real show4.players move incredoubly slow.5. only for Die HArd DBZ fans
1,this company is so slow mailing,"we ordered our dragon ball z gt on November 9, 2002, and it is now nov. 23, 2002 and it is still not here. my son is very disappointed because even on the order confirmation it says (usually ships in 2 days). if you tell someone that then they will more than likely expect that to be fact. my suggestion is if you want your game in a timely manner do not order from this company."
3,Not bad...,"Well, I think it's pretty good, but i'm a DBZ/GT fanatic. Others, however, will probably be turned off by the slow gameplay, and laggy reaction time. Seriously, you fell like you've aged a few years between when you pressed the button, and when the character onscreen actually responds. The graphics look like they're from 1996, which is mainly because they are from 1996. If you're going to get any DBZ game, get Legends. If you already have that, than this is still good."
4,3d-ish,The character is much more 3d. I like it when they look at thier opponent even if they were in the sky.
3,It WORKS on a PS2,"first off this game works on a PS2... no problems. that's the only system I've ever played my copy on. Secondly this game is notyhing special... it doesn't even have a story mode. It has a build up mode that youy develope your character's attacks & defenses it's slow... the graphics aren't that great... but ok for when it was released I suppose, & the controls are so-so... save your money if you're looking looking for a good fighting game. but if you're an interested collect I'm selling my us version. email me at: zero_system80@yahoo.com"
3,People... please,"Its not ""little goku"" its Goten, Goku's son. Why do you think he can go super saiyan? Goku didn't do that until he was in his 40's... I'm 21 years old and correcting kids on dbz facts, I'm so sad haha"
5,coolest ever!!!!!,"i recently got this game from a friend and every thing about it is cool. The graphics,sound,not really the music but every thing else is cool.the english version isnt as cool as the import version. (...)"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY DBZ/DBGT FAN!!!,"I HAVE TRIED THIS GAME BEFORE AND I PLAYED FOR HOURS. This is the type of dragonball game that never gets boring!!! You can pick the most best worriors like s.s. goku 4, and Frieza!!! i am going to buy this game as soon as i see it on sale on a web site with a resonable price. I have a warning to all buyers of this game: DRAGONBALL GT FINAL BOUT DOESN'T WORK ON A PS2. IT ONLY WORKS ON A JAPANESE PLAYSTATION, OR A ORIGINAL USA. PLAYSTATION BUT IF YOU USE IT ON THE USA. PLAYSTATION YOU NEED A DIVICE CALLED A MOD CHIP. A MOD CHIP LETS YOU PLAY JAPANESE IMPORTED GAMES ON AN ORIGINAL USA PLAYSTATION!!! Dragonball gt final bout is worth it all because i can't get over the adictive gameplay!!! buy this game and play the rarest dbz game out!!!"
5,Best fighting game ever,"This game is the best Dragon ball z game ever. It's even better than the new Dragon ball z budokai game for playstation 2. Dragon ball final bout has all the characters wanted. No other Dragon ball z games have Goku super sayin 4 or some of the best characters in it like DRAGON BALL FINAL BOUT. But I really want to see an American version of Dragon ball final bout. AND Its not Goten's on the game, that small Goku that could turn into a super sayin is Goku. He becomes small like that in Dragon ball gt to go save the Dragon. His name is CHIBI- GOKU."
5,help this is a good game.Christopher Burris is the reviwer,This dragonball z- gt game is one of the best. Dragonball z ultamte battel 22 and dragonball z legandes are cool to.All the guys in this game are in 3D. here are people to unlocke as well as a good varity of already there fighters.The characters are1.goku or gokou2.pan3.little goku4.trunks5.piccilo6.super vegeta7.gohan8.cell9.majin buu or evil buu10.frezziaunlocke.11.super sayain goku12.super goku13.super trunks14.super sayain trunks15.super sayain 4 goku ( not super syain 4 vegeta)16.super vegetto (a fusion of goku and vegeta with the fusion earings)17.super sayain 3 gotenks.please if any body knows how toget super sayain 3 gotenks please tell me.
3,Hard to get...,This game was so hard to get but that was about the only downside. I gave this game a 3 out of 5 because the scenery could have been way better and the dragon ball characters can fly forever and for as high as they want on the show but in the game they cannot go forever..... with that aside everything else was great. A full 17 characters after beating the game with 4 modes make this game a must have if you liked any of the tekken series!
1,Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout,This game stinks. I have the Japanese version and the converter even with the converter it still doesn't work.I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this game. I have two and if someone wants them send me an e-mail. I willing to sellthem very reasonable.
2,Absolutely Horrible!!!,"First off, you could probably beat the game within an hour. Yes an HOUR! Second, the game has no plot at ALL! Last but not least the bonus characters you unlock are just the people you start out with but in different clothes."
1,Terrible!!,"The games graphics are great, speed could use some improvement, and if you don't learn the in's and out's it can even be somewhat hard. However, the in's and out's of how to win are simply too easy. If you take Vegetta and simply low punch every fighter repeatedly you can win the game without ever being hit no matter what the difficulty level! This is simply not worth the time and effort to play unless you have two players."
2,unhappy,"The game will not play in my son's play station 2, how do we start the game in a play station 2 system?"
2,Japanese Version is Better,Below are the differences between the Japanese and American releases.1. The Biggest Fight intro song was replaced with some crappy instrumental that sounds like a boss theme Sound effects were in The Japanese version but weren't present in the US one2. the Graphics are pretty good but I have one problem you have to jam on the buttons to get the characters to move quick3.cast of characters with Biggest fight Playing is missing at the end and The credits The Japanese one Hironobu Kageyama is singing in the end credits while the US just replaced it with an instrumental of the same song. I don't know why they couldn't use the instrumental of the biggest fight I found hidden on the disc itself for the intro.4. the voice acting is awful I know this was rereleased but couldn't they redub it with the Funimation actors instead of those Mediocre ones. Japanese the original voices from the original anime.
2,Make sure you give them the right information.,The game Dragonball Final Bout is not the worst because it got here in 4 work days but they sent me the wrong version which does not show the full capability of the game suppliers. I know that they could have gave me the right version.So far it has been a couple of days since I wrote a e-mail to get there address to send the game back and to recieve the correct version.The main way that you could have no worries is you have a Japan Playstation system because it won't work on the american version.
5,the best game ever,this game is the best game ever.if you want a good game to play you would order dragon ball gt: final bout. there are 19 characters in the game.
2,this game ...,i havent bought this game but ive played it at my friends house. But the graphics r horrible the gameplay and the controls ... to i reccomend u not buy this game
5,Dragon Ball GT,I think that it was the the best game i ever played the action of it was really great.
4,Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout,"While a select few may argue, Dragon Ball Z is taking the US by storm and this title deserves a special place in the hearts of Anime fans; after all, it was one of the first english language DBZ titles to hit Playstation. It provides unique gameplay on the PS1 which allows you to fly at will and attack above, below or on either side of you. You also have the ability to build your players strength and skills well beyond imagination! What it comes down to is a fun, action packed fighting game based off of popular animation.... What else could you ask for? Buy it, play it, love(d) it!"
4,Could of been better.,"Dragonball GT Final Bout seem like a great game at first, right? But then you start playing. As you will notice, the controls are very delayed. This doesn't bother me because I think it makes it more of a challenge, more fun. The controls aren't as hard as some people make them sound. Goku's Kamehameha wave consists of hitting 3 buttons, the first 2 are directional the last one is circle. There are a wide variety of characters, but there are too many Goku's. There are six Goku's out of 19 characters. There is only 1 Vegeta (2 if you want to count Veggeto) and only one Gohan. One good thing is you can get Super Saiyan 4 Goku. There is a way to play as Super Bebi also. I have the Japanese version of the game and it is just as good as the American version (I have played them both), only for a lot cheaper, but you need a converter or MOD chip. Overall 9 out of 10."
1,not happy with false advertisement,i am up set because you guys advertised as dragonball gt final bout and you sent me dragonball final bout (not the same game at all an a matter of fact dragonball is on the the first games of maybe 4 and the one you sent was not what you avertised and now i'll have to settle because christmas is to close to return it (i promised my son that i would get it)
1,the worst game ever,Im a big fan of DBZ/GT but Id rather watch Barney or telletubbies than play this gamethis game is without a doubt the worst game everthe controls are horriblethe graphics are OKthe intro is stupidthe voices are really messed upand its agonizingly slowdont waste your money on this abysmal piece of trash
2,Barely a mention of Filipino guerilla fighters,"The story is told as a celebration of the courage and skill of the American soldiers who freed hundreds of brutalized American POWs. The footage is dramatic, the heroes and their reminiscences profoundly moving.But it was the courageous Filipino guerillas -- whose stealthy reconnaissance, knowledge of the land and of the brutality of the Japanese -- who made the American rescue not only possible, but massively successful. These young men, thousands of whom died in defense of Americans here and elsewhere during the war, should be honored with so much more than the minuscule mention they receive in this film."
2,Not enough of Jake playing the ukulele.,"I thought this DVD would feature Jake playing his ukulele more than an exhibition of creative camera work that really took away from the intent of the viewer who came to see Jake's techniques and stylings. I wanted to see Jake's fingering methods, and a complete presentation of some of his more popular numbers. Instead, I felt frustrated when most of the DVD showed only gimpses of Jake, often showing his back, face, and other shots of people and things. Everything except showing his ukulele playing which I thought this DVD was all about. I wish I was able to preview this DVD before I purchased it."
2,Jake Shimabukuro-A Million Miles Away,"I was pretty dissapointed with this DVD. I am a huge Jake fan and I've seen him play live 3 times, so the dvd definitely does not live up to those experiences. If you are looking for a good Jake dvd, Play Loud is much better. This dvd seems like someone followed him around with a home video camera and then just made a dvd out of it. Its more of him walking around talking to people, than it is him playing music. It's ok toward the end when it shows him playing in a small restaurant, and you actually get to see him play. This dvd should be a million miles away from you dvd collection."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS IT GETS,"...These software products are okay, but are nothing compared to the real stuff. For one thing, the voices sound like ROBOTS, not like humans, so it can be annoying after a while...It is okay on accuracy, but only for streets that have been around for more than 5 years..."
2,Not holding up after first use!,"I bought these for stocking work for my job. I'm on my knees stocking shelves 25% of my shift and I need something that doesn't fall apart.I put these on and for about 3 hours of my shift they were super comfortable. Then I started to notice that my knees were getting sore. Sure enough, after one 8 hour shift, the cushion inside compressed and didn't come back up. Now I've got brand new kneepads with compressed foam. I'll end up turning these into gardening kneepads, since this particular pair I got is not going to work on hard floors.The construction was top notch, but they need to use a more durable foam core. Finding good kneepads is getting harder and harder. Some pairs last almost a year while others struggle to last a few weeks. I'll keep looking."
4,Comfy!,"Very comfy on the knees, but the straps are a bit uncomfortable when kneeling down on the back of the knees. Must be wan pretty tight in order for it to not slip, but cuts off circulation a bit if warn like that. I just keep it loose and then pull them into position when kneeling down.Overall keeps the knees nice and pain-free :)"
4,Information on Seven Little-known West Papuan Cultures,"Like the other volumes of the same series by SIL, this book examines the cultures of 7 little-known Papuan ethnic groups: the Sobei of the north coast, the Yawa of Yapen Island, the Kaure, Sikaritai and Edopi of the northen interior lowlands, the Meyah of the Bird's Head Peninsula and the Irarutu of Arguni Bay. Focus is on their social organization and kinship, but an interesting general introduction and maps are also provided for each group."
3,Fair,"I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm not too sure if it actually is helping with lactation. I starting taking Brewer's Yeast to increase my milk supply. Granted I don't really have a supply problem, but I didn't want it to decrease. I feel like I'm producing the same amount as before I starting taking it. The taste is an acquired thing. It tastes sorta nutty, with a distinctive smell. It doesn't dissolve in water, so you'll have to mix it in food, not liquid."
3,Waterpik SM-421 review,Good value for the price. While in use leaks water from the center of shower head from day one. But boosts water pressure a bit. Its pretty basic but is an improvement over what I had. Cheaply made.
5,plus white,Great toothpaste. I have been using it now for about three years. They don't sell it at Wal-Mart anymore so I order it off of Amazon cheaper than if I did buy it at Wal-Mart. I left the country for 6 months and had to switch brands of toothpaste. I hated it. I seen a color difference in my teeth the first two weeks of not using Plus White. I'm a coffee drinker and a smoker. I get lots of compliments on my teeth all the time on how white they are. I hope this review helps. I will never switch brands. Ever..
2,Plus white Xtra tooth paste,Made my teeth sensitive. The product whitened okay .. Discontinued in one week's time.I would not re purchase ... I already have 5 tubes I won't use.
1,good idea/bad design,"This was my first sunshower purchase. Used it once and gave it away. The top kept folding in and had to find sticks to place in between the rope, to keep it squared up. There wasn't any branches to hang the shower. Luckily, I had some extra poles with me and used two trees. Save your money and buy a free standing shower. Leave the trees alone."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I wish I would've paid more and got a better enclosure. It was tough finding a tree that had a good enough branch to support it. The top of the shower kept folding, so I never felt like there was much room. Next year I'll invest in a stand alone, slightly bigger enclosure."
1,WAY TOO SMALL,"Chances are, you will not fit in this. Way too small,even my wife who is 5'6"" tall and weighs 105 lbs. cant fit. Better off buying something else. Dont waste your time or money."
3,size of earrings,"I wish I had gotten the larger 1/2 carat size, these are too small for my taste. They are very shiny and look fine, I am just a tall person and need more around my face.Overall, the quality of the earrings are very good. I got the 14k white and yellow gold sets. I may give the second set to a young cousin who would love them."
1,Not quite the same,"I was disappointed with these earrings, the setting is not like the picture. The setting looks more like wires holding the stone, it is not nearly as substantial as the photo shows."
5,U get what U pay for!,"Several years ago we thought ""another"" product could do the job for less money. We were wrong. Intuit products have a purpose, and that is: ""To get your money's worth and more"". QuickBooks is designed to completely fulfill your business operating needs hands down."
1,Damaged Goods,"CD came damaged from the Manufacturer and would not load. CD had a visable fault in making of the CD. I am expecting a full refund, but have not received it yet."
1,Poor construction,This product is poorly made. The bulb socket is brittle and easily cracks when changing the bulb rendering the kit useless. I've replaced several of these trim kits in my home over the last 2 years due to this problem. I finally got fed up with this repeated problem and ordered different trim kits for these fixtures (6 in all). Would not recommend this product.
4,different sockets now?,"The ones I just received had ceramic sockets, so they may not have the problem the other reviewer reported. I am replacing ones with plastic sockets which are brittle and break easily."
3,Colors hard to match,"This poster has many various colors in it... I did like it overall, but had forgotten how small it was going to be....Overall, unless you've seen this print in person and KNOW that it matches wherever you are going to hang it... I wouldn't shell out the cash for it... unless $ isn't an object and you just HAVE TO HAVE this.It's kind of busy... but I like that about it myself."
2,"Rest of CD doesn't match ""Flowers on the Wall""","I bought because of the single -- the brilliant modern-rockabilly remake of ""Flowers on the Wall"" -- and just wanted to warn you that the rest of the album is different from the single.The other tracks are all listed as co-written by Heatherly -- no other remakes that I recognized; the emphatic but subtle drum work on the single is reduced to headache-inducing pounding repetitiveness on the other tracks.The single must have been arranged and recorded at a different time with a lot more care than the rest of the album.He's being positioned as a sort of new Elvis -- with brooding 50's era photos at a motel. Booklet has the longest list of acknowledgements I have ever seen. The hair stylist is listed in the same type size as the musicians. <smile>Wish they would do more like ""Flowers on the Wall!"""
4,DB Ocean Waves,"This was my first video of ocean waves, so I had high hopes. The video camera was not still in some spots. There are some nice pans backwards showing the houses by the beach, and for the most part the camera was set still towards the waves. A couple spots of birds walking by. For the first minute the video jumps eradically, possibly because of manufacture defect. The last 20 minutes? is on a separate section that you must play to continue. Overall, it was relaxing and did what I bought it for."
3,Venom's Wrath: A Joke of Venom,"The story line was excellent but the way Venom was depicted was horrible. It portrayed Venom as a slow-minded fool who wasn't even human. Technically thats true since he's bonded with the alien but in all the other novels Venom is a very intelligent very dangerous being. What was with the author calling him the creature throughout the story, he's always referred to as Venom or the symbiote. He also spends most of his time being blasted to near incapacitation, which has never happened before, he's always gotten pounded on but it never really fazed him. He has written as too much of a wimp instead of being a fast, intelligent, dangerous, nut-case."
2,Too slow moving plot,"Despite the fact that it's called Venom's Wrath, this story moves along too slowly to keep the reader interested. That plus the fact that the final Venom/Spider-Man battle is so under-welming and more attention is placed on the NYPD cops then on Spider-Man, makes this more of a book where Spider-Man has an extended cameo apperance, rather then being the focus of the story."
2,Sending it back.,"This is a nice vacuum. I bought it because of the dirt devil name, but I bought it for cleaning my house which is 90% carpet. The attachment for carpet cleaning (called turbo floor cleaner) is terrible. I have a longer fiber carpet but this attachment grabs hold of the carpet on a forward push and literally is useless for carpet that I and probably many others have. I really needed this to work on my rugs too so I'm discouraged at having to send it back. Hope people see this and it helps in your decision. Very nice vacuum - bad idea for some carpets."
1,If I could give a negative number-- I would!,"I had to get a vacuum cleaner when my husband and I moved into a new apartment, and we got this one because I love having a canister, it was 160 at Best Buy when I got it. I took it home and there was no suction AT ALL! We went to a different store and got a full, huge vacuum, for 50 bucks, and that thing works magic! Let me tell you this is a horrible vacuum, I keep it for picking up kitty litter, but if you want that deep clean that you need in a carpet, especially with animals. It is no where close to being worth your money."
3,Good not great,I recently purchased this vacuum. It does a good job on hardwood floors but carpet not so much. The attachments could use some redesign work. There are two little wheels and a felt strip for the hardwood floor attachment which makes a lot of noise and if your floors are in really good shape you can see fine scratches. I like the vacuum overall for the price.
3,"Liked it, but had to return it!","I just received this vacuum and had to return it. Although it did a very good job on my wood floors and low-pile carpeting, there seemed to be a ""short"" in the handle. Whenever I pushed or pulled the handle the speed of the vacuum would alternate. Hopefully this was just a one-time defect because I did like the way it worked, it's light weight, etc. We'll try it one more time!"
3,"Works good, but cheap plastic parts","Got this because it was lightweight and would do my bare floors better than my upright. It does the job it's meant to do just fine.My only beefs are:a) there's a plastic piece on the body that allows you to attach the wand with hose so it will stand next to vac when not in use. The piece is a hard cheap plastic and broke within daysb) the onboard tools are actually on the wand and they are down in the lower section, near where the tool connects. They're constantly falling off, especially if you go in tight spaces to vac. They would have been much better attached higher on the wand or better yet, on the canister itself.Other than those two annoyances, the vac works fine."
2,"poor ""Vision""","I was really disappointed with this vacuum, I found it to have poor suction especially when it came to our thick carpeted areas. It did do well on the floors though. We replaced our 12yr old vacuum that worked fantastic until it finally died! I don't think I will be purchasing another Dirt Devil vacuum again. I certainly don't recommend this product to anyone who has thick carpets."
1,Was great when it worked.,"I've had this just over a year. It worked great when it worked. Took it out of the closet today, plugged it in, and nothing, no power. I've taken care of it and cleaned it every time I used it. I'd like to think $129 gets you a vacuum that lasts more than a year. Obviously, Dirt Devil disagrees."
4,Great vacuum for bare floors.,"DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU HAVE CARPET!! Now that I have gotten that out of the way. This is a great vac if you have bare floors like tile or wood. If you have carpet, you will need a second vac, period! The canister is interesting in how it releases it's contents. There is a button on the side that opens the bottom lid. The only issue I have is that the cord sometimes wants to retract, which causes it to unplug. There is a button that is suppose to retract it, but I have noticed it retracting without pushing the button. I wish the cord was longer."
2,Dissapointing,"This product was dissapointing. It looks nice and the size is convenient, but the vacuum is really weak, the machine lacks capacity. If you can afford go for Electrolux or another brand. It is not worthy the money"
1,warranty void,"Although this vacuum works ok....after using it for less than a year, the power head broke. I called Dirt Devil. They proceeded to tell me that, although it was technically under the 2 year warranty, they could not replace my part based on the fact that it wasn't a ""manufacturer defect"". This is their way of saying, ""we pretty much don't stand behind our products."" They can't stand up to any sort of wear or they would stand behind replacing parts that break within the first year of use. So, I ended up having to pay for the replacement attachment myself. I am highly disappointed in the quality of the product and the customer service of the company!!"
2,Only good on non-carpeted floors,"This vacuum has plenty of suction but it's beater brush is not designed to pick up dog hair and suck it up, it tends to get tangled in the brush and I have to cut it out. Hair also gets clogged in the hardwood floor attachment and then I have to manually pull it out. I bought it because the reviews I read on it were good. I am so dissapointed in this machine. If you have no animals or carpet it would probably be fine for you, otherwise don't waste your money."
2,"Disappointed, does not work on carpet or rugs.","I read the other reviews and I see now that either a good number of these reviewers make their living as paid shills for the manufacturer or else their deluded somehow.This vacuum comes with a 'suction-powered' beater bar. I WILL NOT WORK ON CARPET or RUGS. Isn't this the purpose of a vacuum cleaner? On bare floors it seemed to work ok, but was absolutely useless on anything else.I know now that I cannot trust the reviews of any product online, but I appreciate Amazon's super easy return policy.It's the only reason I continue to shop here.Back to the research..."
4,Works for me,"This may not be the most powerful vacuum out there but it works great in my house. I have a three story townhouse and I am so happy to finally have a vacuum that will easily go up and down the stairs and that is easy to manuver while vacuuming the stairs. The attachments are great although my biggest complaint would be that there isn't any good, secure onboard storage for them. The are meant to clip to the wand but they fall off very easily. I really love the power switch being on the handle and I love that you can change the level of power being used. It makes it a breeze to easily go from vacuuming the carpet to the kitchen floor and rugs to the sofa. I can do it all in a snap."
4,Cool little thing....,"I have two carpeted rooms and it sucked up quite a bit of dirt in no time!! Very powerful for a small vacuum. The canister must be emptied fairly often, but to me that's minor for the amazing work it does."
4,"Good Suction, Works Well on Hard Floors","Very good suction for a small machine. Works as advertised. I did not get the impression of a cheap product as some others have described. Works very well on hard wood or laminate floors. The automatic cord winder spring could be slightly more powerful. I wish the dust chamber was slightly bigger, but then again that would compromise the compactness of the design. Would recommend the product for the price. It is almost half the price of some of the elite brand comparables."
2,Good Suction Horrible Cord,"The vacuum boasts an automatic cord retraction. I received this vacuum and plugged it in and was pleasantly surprised with the suction. Then i hit the cord retraction button only to find that it didn't retract. So now I was stuck with 20 feet of cord that wouldn't go back into the system. I contacted amazon and returned this product for the same vacuum, only to find that this cord didn't retract either. Overall I am very disappointed with this vacuum and have contacted dirt devil to find out why neither of these vacuums cords automatically retracted. The funny part about the whole thing is that the instructions tell you to hold the cord to avoid it from whipping back at you."
4,Dirt Devil vac,"we purchased the vacuum based on previous reviews found online from other people who also purchased it. I think it's a really good quality product, bagless and light weight. Attachments are perfect for our new wood floors."
4,Dirt Devil Turbo Canister Vacuum,"Excellent choice! A vacuum with great suction power and you can control it very easily. Easy to handle, easy to clean... great price. Highly recommended!"
3,Vacuum,"not quite what I expected, but a good value none the less. Good suction and lightweight.Dirt Devil 082700 Vision Turbo Canister Vacuum. Wanted better performance from the carpet nozzle, expecting it to be powered. However does an adequate job on carpeted stairs."
3,does't work,"I received this vac in 5 days! However, the hand wand variable speed selection cuts out every few seconds. I took it to an authorized service center @ Hollywood Blvd. Vacuum center service. The owner ridiculed me for purchasing this Vac over the internet and told me to send it back. I then contacted the 800 # and they authorized to return it directly to Dirt Devil i.e.the power cord plug, which will do 03/15/2010. I hope this will be resolved soon."
2,Scratches wood floor,"Not too happy with mine. Scratches my wood floors, not very powerful suction and has a short cord."
1,Vacuumm cleaner,Worst vacuum cleaner I have ever seen. The tools keep falling off and there is no place to hold the tools. A place is provided on the wand but the tools keep falling off. This is the last Dirt Devil I will ever own. I had a Dirt Devil before this and the Dirt Devil broke where the hose made the connection to the machine.
2,Wouldn't accept this vacuum if it were given to me for free!,"This vacuum sat unopened in the box for 2 months while we renovated our home and by the time I used it and realized how terrible it was, it was too late to return for a full refund.First off, I was warned by previous reviewers: this vacuum is not, I repeat, IS NOT made to vacuum carpet. It does as good of a job as your 4 year old's pretend vacuum would do! Even on bare floors, I find myself having to go over each area twice in order to pick up everything.The WORST thing is, if you have a home bigger than 1000 sq ft, you'll probably have to vacuum it in 2 sessions, as this vacuum has a 'convenient' automatic shut off when it gets too hot. I consider myself lucky it I can vacuum half of our 2000 sq ft home before it shuts off!All in all, I will suffer thru this poor investment until I atleast feel I've gotten my money's worth, and I won't even bother trying to resell it used!"
1,This model is junk!!,The first Dirt Devil 082700 Vision Turbo Canister Vacuum we received was defective. The replacement that we received was also defective. Would not recommend this unit at all. Amazon customer service was awful. It took many hours of phone time (7 calls) to get these items returned.
1,Don't waste your money,"This vacuum worked for the first two times and then it just went down hill from there. I have a dog so there is a lot of pet hair and now 6 months later it won't pick up any hair, dirt etc. I'm very disappointed! This was not exactly in my budget and I thought I would get a more expensive vacuum because it would last longer, now I'm kicking myself about the money. This vacuum is only good if you don't have pets, kids, or dirt on your floor."
2,Gets clogged alot,"Vacuum wizard rates this a top canister vacuum, but I have to unclog it durring most uses. carpet fuzz and hair get caught in the aluminum wand. Overheats after 30 minutes of max power use. I'm looking for the warranty so I can hopefully return it!"
1,NOT WORK THE MONEY!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS VACCUM, NO POWER....BOUGHT IT A COUPLE OF MONTH A GO...AND i REGRET IT!!!NO USE FOR MY....."
2,not as expected,"item looks appealing in bright red but does not deliver on many fronts: 1) cleaning head is too short, requiring many passes/greater time+ energy expense; 2) cleaning head is complicated and very difficult to clean; 3) biggest drawback is that this machine simply doesn't have the suction power that it should, for the money; 4) those so-called ""engineers"" who designed these things obviously don't have to do much vacuuming of their own...get serious boys! get us something that will really suck the grime out of those floors or at least get mitt romney's hair to move!."
2,"""Kicked the bucket"" after 2.5 years","I bought this vacuum in December 2008. Got this one for hard floors, getting pet hair off upholsterer and couple of area rugs. It worked great for those uses. I especially like the variable suction and the on/off/control switch on the handle. However, I soon discovered that the holder for the accessories, just a plastic clip on the wand, was inadequate, and soon one of the brushes dropped off and disappeared. The filter didn't last that long, and replacements cost around $25.00. Within the last month or two, the vacuum has started overheating and shutting itself off after less than 10 minutes, and this is on the floors. Then it died and was successfully put by the curb... Of course for $129.99 in 2008 with the way small appliances are being built these days the expectation was that this vacuum cleaner will work at least 4-5 years. I was wrong."
2,"Convenient Vacuum, poorly manufactured","I really liked this vacuum when it first arrived. Was my first canister vac. Motor was quiet. Was really convenient for getting under couches - had really great suction for picking up dirt between grooves in our hardwood floors.Then, after about 5 uses it wouldn't turn on again. I had read the reviews beforehand from many brands and had decided on this one, despite reading a review that someone else had a similar problem with the machine failing after just a couple of uses. This is REALLY bad, Dirt Devil. Only means their standards of quality are low. Will not buy another Dirt Devil again."
3,This vaccum looks great,I'd been looking for a light weight vaccum to pick up small messes and to do the car ect. For these projects it's great but if your looking to purchase a vaccum for everyday use on a carpet then buy something better like an up-right. The attachment for carpets on this vaccum is cheaply made and is not going to hold up to everyday use.
4,Great Vacuum!,"This is an awesome little vacuum. The only problem is what everyone else mentioned. The tools are attached in a STUPID spot. So they fall off. I just leave my tools off so I am not frustrated. LOL.As far as suction, this little thing is great. I love the wind up cord too!Great vacuum for the money! Would have rated a 5 if not for the tool attachment location."
3,cute sporty vacuum,"Size is wonderful, suction is fantastic, the hose is super flexible and that is fantastic. However, the attachments always fall of when I put them in "" their "" spot of rest . The rug attachment works ok, I recommend cleaning it out right away, a lot of hair can get caught up in it. The filter needs to be cleaned out often. ALL in ALL I do like it. Would I have bought a better one YES :) Why ! because I am a clean freak . HAPPY CLEANING :)"
1,worst vacuum ever!!!!- hate that i have to give it a star,"I never write reviews on products, but I am begging you, do not buy this vacuum!!!Why, you ask?1. filter clogs2. this vac is not good if you have a pet or toddlers-this vac clogs with pet hair and todler food- you have to stop, dig out the pet hair or the dried mac and cheese noodle from the filter and begin again.3. the vac turns off when it becomes over heated which in my case is all of he time!!!4. the canister gets filled up quickly with dirt- I only live in a 1700 sq ft house. I should not have to empty the canister 4-5 times."
1,no power and small canister,"This is the worse vacuum I've ever owned. It has no power and doesn't clean my rugs well at all because it air-driven, not power driven and the canister is super small. I have to empty it constantly and clean the filter constantly. too small. I wish I could send it back and get my money back but I've already used it once. I highly recommend you don't pay the money for the machine."
4,Dirt devil,"I found this product works very well,except for the fact that because its a twelve amp vacuum it doesn't work on some wall plugs that have a fifteen amp breaker."
3,Automatic Cord Retraction,"I like the vaccum a lot it works well but from day one I have not been able to get the automatic cord retraction to work. Yes, I know I could return it but the reason I ordered it on line is because I do not have time to go shopping. I purchase the Dirt Devil because I have a upright one that I have had for years and love it."
1,Horrible,I bought this vacume when moving into a new place. This vacume couldn't vacume up a piece of dust if it's life depended on it. Even on hard surfaces you can feel the grit. This is the worst piece of garbabge I have ever purchased. To make matters worse I live about 45 minutes from the closets store to return the item. All of the pieces weren't even in the box. Totally disappointed in this product especially for how expensive it was.
3,Good overall vac,"I like how light this vacuum is and the fact that I can manuever under my furniture. I'm a little unhappy with the attachments feature, they do not stay clipped on. Also, I wish there was a place to clip the carpet attachment on the canister when it is not in use. I sometimes feel like I'm going to break the head of the bare floor attachment when it changes direction. It makes a clicking noise that makes me nervous. On the plus side, the suction is great, the cord is plently long enough, and I like that the switch is on the handle. For the price point, I would buy it again."
4,Great Vacuum!,"I am very pleased with the Dirt Devil Vision. I have hardwood floors in my apartment and two cats, and this vacuum gets rid of cat hair very well without scratching the floor. It is easy to handle and I like the convenience of the canister style, as it reaches under beds and dressers, and the attachments are great for rugs and upholstery. There were no surprises when I got the product, as it is accurately described online. The suction is good, however if you intend to use this for carpet and not hardwood floors, you might be disappointed as the suction is great for bare floors, but not as good for carpets.Overall, this is a great vacuum and I recommend it highly."
1,bagless vacuums - messy concept,"I bought this vacuum 4 months ago and am very disappointed. Not only is the vacuum quite loud and suction lousy, but you have double the work to empty it. You need to clean up the mess after emptying the canister and need to clean it often. It does a poor job on the few rugs I have and now its in the shop to see if they can figure out why it doesn't suck. I would never buy this vacuum again and who knows how the warranty will work. Next vacuum will have a bag!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!,"This vacuum didn't last very long till it broke, but I didn't like it at all anyway. The handle was short so you'd have to stoop over to vacuum!!! It was also heavy, clumsy and cumbersome. I do NOT recommend this vacuum. I have had Dirt Devil vacuums in the past that I loved. This one was a huge disappointment and a waste of money."
1,Upset,"Don't buy this vacuum!!!! I vacuum twice a week, no pets and only 2 people in the house. I've had it for about a year now and I hate using it. I bought it because of the bagless idea(thinking I would save money in the long run not buying bags), but boy was I wrong. Due to the design, the filter gets dirty and clogged after 2 uses and impossible to get cleaned. Therefore, you are buying new filters every other time you use it. And they are not cheap. The bagless canister is also very small, so while vacuuming a 2,000 square foot house, I'm emptying it 3 or 4 times. Big pain. The suction is great the first time you replace the filter but within minutes it's aweful. I really wish I could get me money back. Please don't waste you money. Dirt Devil you should be ashamed of yourself!"
2,Died after 2 uses. Don't buy! You will probably end up returning it.,"The vacuum died after 2 uses. The vacuum ""Power"" switch on the wand stopped working for me. I did a lot of research but apparently not enough because other people had the same problem. The technology behind the canister vacuums is not 100% solid right now. All canister vacuums have a problem with not turning on after a few uses. The problem seems to be in the wand power. I would not recommend this item to anyone!"
1,Don't buy this to vacuum carpets,I bought this vacuum to vacuum my carpets. I wish I hadn't. I wish I had read these reviews before I bought it. It is the worst vacuum I have ever had. It does not pick up at all. A complete waste of money. Color is pretty but that's about the best thing about it!
1,Dirt Devil Vision Turbo - Worst Machine,"This is the worst vaccuum I've ever owned or used. Almost no suction at all on area rugs (I could use a hand broom and get better results!). It tends to tip over when turning. The ""on-board"" tools pop off everytime the wand goes under a chair. The only plus is the light weight. I am amazed that anyone would put their name on a product this ineffective and badly designed."
4,Dirt Devil 082700 Vacuum,"I live in an apartment where the all the floors except the kitchen, bathroom and entryway are covered with the typical low pile rugs. This machine worked fine for me and what I especially like about it was how easy it was to set up and use right away. I don't like reading instructions...I want my gadgets to be intuitive. So, by pushing and pulling various buttons and slides, I was able to get to work on my rugs pretty quickly."
4,Terrific Little Vacuum,"I needed a new vacuum for my home's entryway, kitchen and dining room rug. This fit the bill. Having a Golden Retriever necessitates frequent vacuuming and I had to have at least a 12 amp machine. The hose is first class; I love the retractable cord; and it maneuvers well. On the down side, it is a little noisy and I prefer vacuum bags to bagless, but that is just my personal preference.For the money it is extremely well-made."
1,Broken prior to packaging... Why bother?,I was so excited to get my bills and mail organized only to discover a section shattered and a chunk of plastic missing. I checked the plastic and the box that were around the item and the piece was nowhere to be found. Who is doing the quality control on this stuff? I ordered it because the ones at my work look great but this was not as strong as the ones I have seen before!
2,Automatic Short Stem Light,"Product stopped working after a couple of days. Checked light bulb and it was fine, so it was definitely the product"
3,"A very incomplete, but interesting book","This book is very good at showing how basic fracture mechanics can be used to understand real fatigue and fracture problems in construction grade steels. The down side to this book is that the authors tend to promote their point of view and give little attention to other points of view. For example the authors spend numerous pages on their CVN to fracture toughness prediction method, yet give the master curve method only a few sentences, and ignore most of the other 20 some CVN to fracture toughness prediction methods that can be found in the literature. The reader might want to also keep in mind the most of the information in this book is based on late 1980's technology in the U.S. construction steel industry.Mechanical and aerospace fatigue/fracture engineers will probably not find much useful information in this book."
5,Great text for understanding mechanics of fatigue and fracture,The book has great technical development and case studies demonstrating the mechanics of fatigue and fracture failure. It is an essential resource for recognizing fatigue and fracture details and how to mitigate them.
4,Good Learning Tool,"This Book is well written, easy to read, and very useful in learning Fracture mechanics."
3,Not Powerful at all!,"I think the product could be redesigned so much better. First of all, Powerful is a big fat lie. A little bullet has more of a kick. It's not very thick, but I'm okay with that. It's flexable, so if you like to be able to shape your toy, this one would work...but over all, knowing what I know...I would simply try another product. The studs in my opinion, are just there for decoration. Find a better toy."
2,great while it lasts,"this is a wonderful vibrator. the bumps are in all the right places. however, it didn't last me much longer than a month before the cap started getting sensitive. after a little while it only works when it wants to. at times that can mean having to bend it a certain way just for it to work. i wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something that lasts."
3,Slip away....,"Good book, Leppelman was a very crazy guy I'll give him that. The books is good ,it is a quick and easy read. Just like every other war book , follows him around the jungle on missions and his buddies.But the tittle of the book should not have been Blood on the Risers, it does not really have of an Airborne feel to it. nevertheless still worth reading."
3,Slip away....,"Good book, Leppelman was a very crazy guy I'll give him that. The books is good ,it is a quick and easy read. Just like every other war book , follows him around the jungle on missions and his buddies.But the tittle of the book should not have been Blood on the Risers, it does not really have of an Airborne feel to it. nevertheless still worth reading if you are bored and pulling 24hr ops..."
2,Blood on the Risers,"Normally, I do not read Vietnam books. And, since this is less than positive, my statement is brief. I was in one of the author's units: 329th Trans. Co. (the Army Riverboats). And it was because of that reason that I purchased the book. But when I got to a remark that went something like "" ... just more gooks that needed killing:"" I threw the book away. Amazon will not allow this note on the Web, but the publishers of the book allowed that very negative comment to be in print."
5,Airborne!,"This is a must read for anybody who was airborne and enlisted. I must have read 40 books on Nam and this is right up there with the best. A great read that gives you a gut-wrenching feeling on how the infantry warriors truly suffered. It is a wonder John survived his first tour. The value of the book is the first hand account of an ordinary American boy turned warrior in three totally different venues: airborne infantry, brown water swabbie, and airborne ranger. I'd love to buy him a beer if he ever shows up at the 82nd Airborne Assn. or USMC Force Recon Assn. reunions. Airborne John, all the way!"
3,Curious about the combat jump,"The book is a fairly good read. I was with the 173d during Junction City and all of the hill battles. I only have a question really, did you make the combat jump? I know you said you did but in the Official Jump Manifest for that combat jump, your name is NOT on the manifest. What's up with that???"
4,Great Vietnam War Book!,"John Leppelman gives an unvarnished, first hand account of an Airborne soldier in 3 tours of Vietnam. The battle descriptions are very detailed and description of life there very lucid. The book is well written and moves quickly. The totality of the book's battles and struggles hits you like a sledgehammer. Definitely a read if you want to understand the Vietnam War or soldier."
1,Very Poor effort,"This book is a very weak attempt at chronicling one of the most politically motivated and innovative bands in the last 20 years. I would not recommend this book for anyone because there is very little if any new information or stories behind the music and the people who built it. Time would be better spent on the web reading a good faq. I was very disappointed with the effort put into this book, (entirely made up of magazine quote references) and find this book and insult to any biographer or Rage Against the Machine fan. Not worth the 90 minutes it took to read it (nap included)."
3,"Not Bad, but hardcore fans wont learn much.",I just finished this book and i didnt really come away feeling that i had learned anything new. Except for a few i had already read or heard most of the quotes from the band. However Rage is my favorite band and i do as much as i can to keep up with them so to some who dont follow the band as close and especially the newest fan this book is very informative. It traces Rage from their childhood all the way to Zacks departure.
5,Quality cleanse,"Bentonite clay is one of the most important items in the first aid kit. Cleanse, detox, itchy skin, rashes, food poisoning, etc. Love Sonnes brand."
1,False Advertising,"Don't be fooled by the box image on this website. ""Red Sight Laser"" is really ""Red Sight"" for a, separately sold, laser. And guess ""what?"". The laser is more expensive! Oldest trick in the book. Again, don't be fooled like I was.Amazon should fix this description immediately."
2,"The ""Kill-Joy"" of Cooking","No matter how glossy the pictures, this is one dull, boring, lifeless cookbook. I plan to pass it on to my compulsively clean-freak friend who enjoys cooking up over-the-top, over-worked meals. She will love it. The secret to good pastry is to not overwork the dough. If this were a pie crust, it would chip a tooth."
1,Too much!,"This book could have been useable and interesting, but as a well turned out cook myself. these recipes were too much. The etherial and gourmet spiritual pomposity really turned me away. For example, he gives a butter sauce recipe of sorts, but never really spells it out. The rabbit passage was the final straw. For this chef to consider himself a ""god"" ! of food, rabbit spirits, etc... thanks for reminding me to stay vegetarian. How totally unappetizing!! I burned the book I was so mad."
2,French Laundry Cookbook,"For the most part good. However, extremely disappointed in the large amount of information on foie gras. Told quite a bit EXCEPT how extremely inhumane the preparation of this brutal 'delicacy' is."
4,Wonderful Cookbook,"I purchased this as a gift, the person who received it loved it so much we both purchased it for another friend. She loved it too."
3,A Mixed Bag,"I'm a very serious home ""chef"", and I have now tried 10 of the recipes in this cookbook. Some have turned out well, but others appear to have errors or important details left out. This cookbook appears to be like many others from famous chefs: pretty to look at, but not really intended to allow you to create the dishes at home.Don't expect detailed instructions. The cookbook's photos are for showing the end result, not for showing you how to produce it.That said, the cookbook will give you many new and creative ideas. The frustrating part is that you will then have to figure out how to actually prepare them on your own."
5,It's as good as the food at the restaurant,"This is a beautiful cookbook. It would make a great gift. Of course, I'm prejudiced because I have eaten at the French Laundry and would classify that dinner as unforgetable. The recipies are complicated and require a lot of time, but Keller gives you every detail necessary to make the dish. We've tried a couple of things, and they were definitely worth the time and trouble. It serves as a reference book as well because Keller explains many techniques. I love the pictures. Even if you don't cook anything out of it, it's lovely to have."
4,"Beautiful, inspiring coffee table book","Dining at the French Laundry was fantastic. Owning the cookbook puts me no closer to enjoying the wonderful experience they provided. Our esteemed chef has shared his recipes, methods and philosophy - THAT is what this book is about. Altho I am foody who loves to cook, I have attempted one simple recipe from the book, with limited success. Do you really want to prepare a recipe that requires 5 addditional sub-recipes for all its components, and that for just ONE course? Don't expect to re-create the French Laundry experience. Just enjoy the book as a window on the world of that special place."
4,complex recipes,"I've made several recipes out of this book. Majority turn out great, others I wonder what I'm doing wrong. like the chocolate souffle..... yikes never turns out no matter how many times I try. custard turns out great, whipped cheese, prawns, the list goes on. Food turns out elegant and completely gourmet. Great for fine dinning. You need a high level of skill in the culinary field to pull off some of these, or invest in a food dictionary to help you translate some terminology. I'm sure you could pull it off if your knife cuts are that great, it's about flavor after all. I went to Culinary School and we used quite a few recipes from this book, since Thomas Keller is one of the best chefs out there."
5,You have to had eaten here to appreciate this book,Wonderful place and one of the great cookbook!! A must have if you are planning a trip to the French Laundry in Napa.
3,Don't try this at home,"I bought this book for my wife this Christmas. She is an excellent cook and we have been to the French Laundry and loved it. The book is large and pretty, but not one you would place on the counter and risk splattering in the process of cooking. Most of the primary ingredients are impossible to find, unless, perhaps, you are Thomas Keller. He lists 5 sources for a few of the ingredients, but I could only access 2 of the web sites. We would love to try several of the receipies but I think we can only find ingredients for 1 or 2 of them. This is really an expensive souvenir of a wonderful dinner for anyone except a chef with access to exotic ingredients and lots of time."
5,Stunningly beautiful cookbook,"This book is more like the hopes and dreams of the people who own the restaurant and wrote the book. It is visually breathtaking and deserves to be cherished and enjoyed like a work of art, as is the food."
3,Was torturing a rabbit necessary??,Beautiful book except for the Keller's need to go into great detail on how he slaughtered a rabbit in his kitchen while it screamed and tried to get away...and died slowly. I think that was sickening and uncalled for to put in his book. He must think this made him an artisan. I think it was buffoonery and cruel. He also says things that are very American culinary school rather than using French techniques(how to make a butter crust) Great photography. I am happy they left the rabbit being clubbed to death out. The visual was enough. I am a chef and find no need to beat rabbits to death in my kitchen. I have suppliers that provide top notch product.
3,"Overhyped, overworked, bland food","Gary Danko, Eric Ripert and Hubert Keller can cook rings around the French Laundry with far less fuss. To me, both the book and restaurant are cold and pretentious."
5,a reference - beyond a recipe book,A book to read from a to z before even cooking anything! Thomas Keller shares his passion and experience with a genuine interest to make us better cooks with respect to the food. No 21 minutes meal fixes...
5,"a very special, perfect gift","even tho i dont cook much, i love giving this gorgeous gift as a special wedding birhday xmas gift. its beautiful on a table, to savored and appreciated as art to eat. and i do love to eat. great combined with some fun kitchen item, gorgeous french towels, cake server or plate, wonderful serving bowl or plate. we are blessed to be able to have chef keller sign ours, an even more special gift"
5,Awsome,This book is fantastic. The devotion and drive of Thomas Keller is unparalleled. I highly recommend this book for Chefs and Aspiring Home Cooks alike. The photos and lessons are great.
3,Overrated,"Guess this book is popular, but I don't know why. I found one (just one) recipe that I could use and even that one; I saw it somewhere else in a much better cookbook. Most of the ingredients were too expensive for the average cook...lobster, cavier, that sort of the thing.The photos are nice, but many of them don't show what the recipes are supposed to look like. All I got out of this was a feeling like this book is marketed to those rich snobs that just want to have an coffee-table book around featuring exclusive gastonomical delights in a incredibly wealthy locale. Not to my taste."
5,The next level,"I am a management consultant who aspires to be a restaurateur. I have the best sources of ingredients (produce, meat and fish) that you can acquire in New York, and I have strong relationships with all of my suppliers. I commonly cook for selected super-foodie audiences of 5 to 15 in my home, and test original creations in a feedback-intensive environment. The only requirement for joining a dinner party at my house is that guests must give honest, detailed feedback on the dishes they have consumed.Thomas Keller's book was an absolute revelation.For the serious cook, who devotes significant intellectual energy to food -- Keller's ""bible"" will give you lots to think about, and a solid methodology for refining your approach to food.For the generic ""put food on the table crowd"" there are better works out there. However, if you are serious about food, read this book from start to finish and you will be amazed at how your techniques and understandings evolve."
1,Devoid of content,"Nothing but an incoherent collection of allusions to other works, filled with trendy pop-philosophy terminology like ""meme"" and ""holon"". Over 23% of the book is simply the word ""integral"". There are no visions in this book, only ""integral"" visions; a hierarchy is not good enough, it must be an ""integral"" hierarchy. Avoid."
2,Blah- couldn't get through it...,"I lost interest as soon as I saw the first diagram--Wilber seems to have his own categorical system along the lines of a food pyramid for the soul, and I just didn't buy it. I'm inclined to distrust anyone whose explanation of life seems more complex and tedious than life itself... If you want to know about science, read science; if you want to explore the nature of existence, read Alan Watts, or better yet, put down the books and go out and live life."
1,Not on my wavelength,"I personally love eclectic, interesting, insightful books, so when I came upon this title, I just had to have it. I was very disappointed, though.The author seemed comfortable talking about talking about the broad topic, rather like a bibliographer, but when it came to a central vision, a personal spark, there seemed to be nothing.While it might appear to some to be sophisticated and academic, it is neither."
2,I was so disappointed,I've been a fan of the sweet valley series for years. And was looking forward to the fact that Elizabeth had finally broken out on her own. But once again no matter what she follows her heart and it leads back to her twin sister Jessica. I think that for once Pascal and John should put away the fact that twins always come back to each other sometimes twins need to stay apart and this one was no different.If you like the fact that Jessica and Elizabeth make up once again then you'll love the book but if you get tired of it like i have then you'll understand why this book was so disappointing.
2,Inconsistent with early SVU books *Boo*,I am upset because what happens between Elizabeth and Max in this book goes totally against the early SVU books. [spoiler] Booo to whatever dingbat writer that didn't know the character's storylines when s/he wrote this book. Terrible move. Booo :(
4,Good book,I thought this was a great book. I wish the Elizabeth series would continue. This series was great.
4,disappointed over the ending,I really liked this book but it would have been better if Jessica came to London on her own and explained to Elizabeth. At first she doesn't listen until Max sees the real truth. Jessica kissed Sam to show her sister that he is no good. Either way I am happy that Vanessa and James got together. I hope SVU continues until they graduate. At first I didn't like the series. But I changed my mind after reading the first book.
5,This is the one,"Yes, this is the item you're looking for.For all the well educated french guys, George Abitbol is watching you."
5,we loved it!,"This is the marx bros craziest, i couldn't stop laughing. They are all over the place in this one. It was nice to see more of zeppo too. Chico is the man. Groucho, Thelma and that closet- (just watch it!)The scene where Harpo hides in the puppet booth and performs for the kids was hilarous, my kids love this one. If you like yer love comedy with a touch less anarchy and a bit more structure in the story, try A Night At The Opera, but for the kids, its this one and The Coconuts. I love them all :)"
5,Monkey Business is their best work.,"Monkey Business was the first Marx Brothers movie I ever saw and I still use it to compare other Marx Brother movies. A big reason why I like this movie so much is the fact that all four Marx Brothers are in this film and the fourth brother, Zeppo, plays a big role in the movie. In other films he is usually given a side part and not involved much in the movie. I could go on and on about the movie but if you're looking for a Marx Brothers movie to buy, I would suggest this one. It has many jokes and scenes for which the Marx Brothers have become famous for."
3,This is the worst movie the Marx Brothers ever made.,"This movie has no energy, no soul. Some of the jokes are quite funny, but on the whole it is quite boring. A far cry from their other films."
5,"""Love flies out the door when money comes innuendo.""","The first Marx Brothers movie filmed directly for the screen, it's their first great picture. They are a bunch of stowaways on an ocean liner who get mixed up with racketeers along the way. Fast and furiously funny for the most part, though the last 20 minutes, after they get off the ship (after the hilarious scene where they all try to immitate Maurice Chevalier) are a let down. It was their first movie in which rather than being merely wiseacres and insulting punsters they were truly anarchic: Harpo totally disrupts the passport proceedings, stamping everything in sight and then throwing the papers in the air. From this point on they would not be just verbally wild and funny guys, but their humor would take on a Freudian aspect as well. Definitely worth a watch."
1,Bad CD,"Really bad, a feeble attemtp by the manufacturer to make few bucks. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CD, A WASTE OF TIME. Tried ot give it 0-stars, Amazon wouldn't allow it."
4,"I Like this one better than definative, but....","...It's far from essential. This is a nice tid bit of what's out there. It's so good that it leaves you wanting more. Your best bet is to start out with The Complete 1923 Jazz Band Recordings by King Oliver (unbelievably great on ""Off the Record / Archeophone"" label), or The Complete Hot Fives and Sevens (Sony is the company that holds the official rights, but there are several imports out there that are good, and at a lower price). Then work your way up to the Definitive Records (an import jazz lable) collections of complete Decca recordings.His later (pop) stuff is good, but his early (jazz) stuff is legendary."
5,Pops-- The king of jazz trumpet,"THE ESSENTIAL LOUIS ARMSTRONG is a sweeping overview of THE most influential jazz musician of the 20th Century. Disc one contains Armstrong's New Orleans-styled electrical recordings of the late '20's (note that he had made some acoustic horn stuff prior), while the second CD continues the early sides until midway through, and then offers brief glimpses of Satchmo's career from 1938 to '67.To mention a single outstanding example, Armstrong's early beautiful tone is clearly evident on his trumpet intro to 1928's ""West End Blues,"" as is his fine scat voice. Beyond that track, all of disc one is certain to be a revelation to those only familiar with Louis' ""Hello Dolly"" pop-type tunes.Mastering of the antique 78s in particular is remarkable-- they all sound great! THE ESSENTIAL LOUIS ARMSTRONG is a set that belongs in everyone's collection, not just jazz afficionados. Buy with confidence!TOTAL RUNNING TIMES --DISC ONE -- 57:53DISC TWO -- 63:33"
5,Pops was tops!,"All too often ""Greatest Hits"" collections are less than that; however, that is not the case with this fine selection, an excellent compilation of Armstrong's work in classic jazz.If should be pointed out that another reviewer intimates that W.C. Handy was the composer of a substantial number of the tunes on this collection. That is not the case; only ""St. Louis Blues"" and ""Aunt Hagar's Blues"" are Handy compositions and ""West End Blues"" was written by Armstrong's mentor, Joseph ""King"" Oliver"

1,OUT OF TUNE MUSIC,"I am terrible disappointed with this CD. The first 6 tracks are spoilt by a loud audience, yelling and applauding through out the session. I am a fan of both Rimington and Robinson, but Rimington seemed to be really off key and the rest of the band sounded like a typical ""out of tune"" New Orleans band. Tracks 7 to 10 were a little better, without audience, but still sounding like the bandsmen were out of tune with each other. Track 11 was much better, sounding like a real New Orleans band should do, I will not be keeping this CD.Alan Carrick"
2,Klein's Macadamia nuts - just OK,Klein's Macadamia nuts lack the flavor and crunch that I like in a Macadamia nut.
3,"Well written, but too formulaic","I bought this book because it centers around one of my favorite authors, Edgar Allan Poe. This book, unfortunately lost track of Poe's personality and talents. Though the book is well written, I was able to figure out who the murderer was mid-way because it follows basic mystery formulas. I also was annoyed that the main character was given a gimmicky love of Swiss Miss hot chocolate to muse over in almost every chapter. Give me a break!If you're interested in reading two excellent mysteries based on Edgar Allan Poe, definitely read, Randall Silvis' ""On Night's Shore"" and ""Disquiet Heart"" in that order."
4,Surprising,"I obtained this mainly on the strength of Casella's name as I'd recently enjoyed his Mahlerian Second symphony. While not technically perfect, Gertler's playing in the Casella is adequate, and the surprising cadenza-work is pretty impressive. It's unlikely these pieces will ever enter the standard concert-hall repertoire, and so consequently there's not a lot of competition. But I'm glad to have discovered both in reasonably good performances and recordings."
4,Coaching High School Basketball : A Complete Guide to Building a Championship Team,"This has everything a high school coach needs to run a sucessful program. It does not go into great depth as other books do, it is more concise and assumes you know the fundamentals. It has a great drill section and practice itinerary. You do not need your own practice plan-If you follow Bills plan your on the road to success."
3,Coins are low quality,"I bought these coins to complement my I Ching, but there are a couple problems. First off, these coins are hard to distinguish between heads and tails because they are not proper I Ching coins in the first place. Second, the quality is poor; it looks like everything was just painted on top of a washer. Nevertheless, they serve their purpose and I have gotten good readings so far."
2,Horribly Mis-titled,"The title does not reflect the book's subject. Rather than treating its alleged topic, modern soldering, it attempts to be an everything book for technicians.In soldering, your first indication that you've made a good solder joint is the visual inspection. With a book on this topic, I'd expect at least some pictures of good and bad solder joint examples, and photos of the various types of joints and packages the technician may encounter. But, the few graphics are limited to schematics of audio amplifiers and also to primitive line drawings of a few chip packages.I definitely do not recommend this book for soldering, and there are excellent books on fundamental electronics that are so much better than what's presented here. The publisher should have limited the book's scope and required a better presentation."
4,Acceptable for the Complete Collector,If you are a complete collector of Wolfman toys and other collectables this is an acceptable item. Some thought did go behind this design of this monster figure and his semi-diorama pedestal. It does not contain the diminutive detail that some collectors would have wanted but it does seem to convey the essence of the Wolfman and the world that has eternally haunted his humanity.
2,"14"" x 30"" x 1"" filters","I had to complain to the vendor. The origional sealed box only had 11 filters in it. Then I found the filters were all under sized 13.5"" x 29.5 x 1""(would not fit my housing without being shimmed with foam sticky tape) Vendor credited me for the entire purchase)"
2,Someone should point this out,"While this transcription book has some good Bird solos in it, I was always confused about the solos on ""Good Dues Blues,"" ""One Bass Hit,"" ""Ray's Idea,"" ""Oop Bop Sh-Bam,"" ""That's Earl, Brother,"" and ""Things To Come."" I couldn't find them on any Charlie Parker recordings. Jamey Aebersold's website even goes so far as to say that they are transcriptions of ""Unrecorded"" Bird solos. I finally realized that they actually can all be found on Dizzy Gillespie recordings, but the soloist is not Charlie Parker but Sonny Stitt. While they do sound similar, I think it's going way too far to put Stitt solos in a book of Bird transcriptions, and I'm surprised this error hasn't been caught in the 20 years or so that this book has been in print. Oh well."
3,SCANDALOUS TO SAY THE LEAST,"MAXION 4 ends things with a BANG!The goofy sci-fi plot wraps up nicely, which then leaves room for the comedic aspects which finish the book (and the series). Overweight Umehara is in love with Yumi, but he doesn't let that get in the way of his lusting over the amnesiac Professor Nishimura, who is VERY buxom (to say the least!)As usual, Mr. Takebayashi's art is top-notch, and his women are definitely in the same league as Satoshi Urishihara's. From top to bottom (no pun intended), every woman is gorgeous.At the end of the day, MAXION is a light-hearted sci-fi comedy that's jam-packed with busty babes and belly laffs. Have fun with it!"
4,Handy-dandy software for those who like to travel,"My sister and I are planning a trip to California. Since we have never driven ourselves there before, I bought this program to help us know where to go. It has taken a few weeks of playing with it to really find my way aroung in this program but, that's probably just me. It is a great tool for planning not only your route but for details along the way. It gives you names and locations of all sorts of points of interest like historical sites and museums as well as restaurants and hotels with addresses, phone numbers and average cost...Everything! And if you have kids to travel with, it even has games for different ages, up to adults, that you can print out and take along. If you want or need a lot of help in planning a trip or finding a location, I would say this is it."
3,Great software but it needs updating!,"This is GREAT software, but AAA needs to update it! Already the 7.0 version is several years old. The maps in my area are out of date. I would GLADLY buy an updated version of this software if it were only available.."
4,Family Staple,"My children and I live on the opposite side of the nation from our family. A friend has been using this program to plot my trips back home for the past 12 years. It provides campsites and attractions with details that include phone numbers, prices, and specifics. The printout is so nice that my children can navigate. We love it. Once I asked for hotel info and was handed a giant novel! Not practical so I only request campsites and attractions. I still love the way it maps out the trip with time and miles. It's something every family should have."
1,Worthless,"I had an old 3.0 program and loved it. So I thought I would try this one. It was a disaster!I could not get the program to work. I called for tech support and they gave directions for another product. I tried their suggestions and they, of course, failed. I reported to them and asked for advice and received NO HELP or even suggestions."
3,part true- part intepritation,"We do have Patrick's autobiography, and little else. This book adds to this some commentary and extra which show a particular point of view. It is an interesting point of view but not entirely doucmented."
4,Great Relaxed Read,"This entertaining simple read is just that. For those who know the true and accurate writings and history of Patrick, Ireland and the Church, this will be found to be accurate as far as its background, setting and history.It is written in a story format that is readable both for young and old. Where history and facts leaves gapes Bercot fills in the gapes with possible scenarios. He of course uses Preachers license but for those who know all the facts this is noticeable but understandable.Those looking for a deep historic factual thesis will be disappointed in this book but those desiring a light enjoyable introduction to Patrick's life will find this to be perfect. Also for those who know Patrick's life and just desire an enjoyable light night time read this again is ideal."
3,Tough to wade through,"Despite my opinion that David Bercot is one of the best writers around, interesting and captivating, this book is not. I couldn't get through it, though I eventually will. A good friend did get through it, and he told me that it gets interesting around the last quarter of the book. I'm interested in Patrick, but the story format just isn't captivating. Even my friend, who finished it, said he debated putting it down several times, but he really wanted to get to the end.The history's accurate, I'm sure, because Bercot's careful to use original sources and interpret them reasonably, but as a story, it's just dull. Again, that's amazing, because Bercot is an gifted and captivating writer. My thought is that he should have approached it as a history rather than writing it as a story, because his history books can't be put down.I'm only giving it 3 stars, because I know the history can be trusted."
2,Saint Patrick is a Catholic!!!,"I read this book and it has great detail but lies with a Protestant zeal. The author tries to claim that Patrick is not Catholic because he is a protestant who wants to claim Patrick as one of his own, but is totally ficticious. He tries to state that Saint Patrick did not use the shamrock to explain the trinity, was not Catholic, and is not a saint. These revolts against the Catholic Church did not begin until after 200 years after Patrick died. All Churches back then were Catholic and it is sad that they broke off when the Church needed reforming not a split.God Bless and Always in Christ J.M.J.,Joy Marie Murphy"
4,World's Apart,"I felt that the author made his point well, that even though scientists should stick to science and theologians should stick to theology, the two can get along quite compatibly and are frequently more like-minded than they realize."
4,Not such a great deal,"I received this comforter set today. I am giving it 4 stars because it is cute and I like the quality. I am disappointed, however, because I thought it came with a 200ct 100% cotton matching sheet set. The description on amazon.com is rather ambiguous. I saw this same comforter set, for the same price, at various other places and it definitely came with the sheet set. I went with Amazon because of the free shipping. So, clearly I was disappointed when it arrived with NO sheet set. My son is THRILLED with his new comforter though so I won't be sending it back. I think I'll just go an find a plain, solid color sheet set to match.It's a very cute, sporty comforter set, but be assured, at least from Amazon, it does NOT come with the matching sheet set."
3,Good,This is a reference work. It's not written with much style. The entries all have nice photos and not a lot of in-depth text. I'm glad I have it but it could have been a great book.
1,Does this item include the adapter ?,The picture and the description of the picture says this package include the len adapter but the technical detail does not include the len adapter. I am really confused. Does this package include the len adapter for Canon A620?
1,Ditto - What was shipped was not what was advertized,"1) They shipped me an adaptor which doesn't fit my Canon Powershot A620 (it's only designed for the A650, or they just choose an adaptor at random to ship to you). Without the adapter it fits, but you can't turn the camera on because the in-built lens expands.2) They shipped me two macro lenses and no telephoto lens3) If the lens had fit, you'd get those infamous black edges if you don't zoom in.4) If the lens had fit, I doubt I'd have seen any image quality improvement."
4,Excellent,I have four other books from this series and plan on getting more.It's an excelent book that helps with more then just drawing techniques for clothes.It also shows potions of the body and many other helpful things.
3,Great jazz of the raorin' 20's...,"However this CD contsains no rarities, and it is just a run of the mill hophodge sampler of ""new York Jazz In The Roaring 20's,"" completests and collectors can find this material elsewhere in much more compete series. Most of the material on this CD is by Red Nichols as a leader, and The California Rambers, you can buy their CD's seperately making this CD, very useless, even though the music is great, it's incomplete, and expensive. Not recommended to jazz collectors, who will already have most of this material."
2,Better Remastering is Out There,"These are the tired old Biograph remasters from the 1960s, some of which were done at the wrong speed, resulting in incorrect pitch. Amazing that no one bothered to correct this. These Edison recordings by Red Nichols' groups are now available in beautifully remastered sound on the Jazz Oracle label, and lovers of 20s hot jazz are advised to seek them out."
2,Raccoons can open it,"This door would work fine to keep out unwanted cats, but anything with the dexterity of a raccoon can get through. The problem is that the magnetic catch only works for the inswing. Raccoons can grab and pull the door open, if they're clever enough. It took my local raccoon 3 days to figure it out, and now it might as well be a normal cat door. The only way to seal them out with this item is to lock it down completely, which you can of course do with a regular cat door.Also, the door needs a hole cut an inch more than should be necessary due to inefficient screw and mechanism placement. Wouldn't be a problem, but I was using an existing hole made for a more efficient door, and had to modify the housing and the screw holes to get it to fit (which the designers of this item could and should have done)."
1,Publisher cares little about book,"Pages 241 to 272 were missing from my copy. I told Springer Verlag about the problem. They noted my complaint but did nothing about it.The book covers current research in depth, but it has little in the way of an overview of the vestibular system."
4,Bush is a vocal god!,"I gotta say that they have made the best move when they've changed Belladonna with John Bush.This guy is one of the best vocalist in the metal music.He's my second favourite singer after Ronnie James Dio and that says a lot.The first 3 songs(Crush,Catharsis,Inside Out)are killers!Same thing goes for Stealing from a thief,Hog tied,Givin' the horns(only on japanese release) and Big fat.Why I didn't rate this one with 5 stars?2 reasons:Harms way and Pieces.Not so strong songs like the rest of the album.A must for every metal fan !"
3,It's not great but it's not bad,"I love Anthrax in all, but I known Anthrax can do better then this. This CD is OK but If you really want to hear some really good Anthrax check out Stomp 442 and Sound of White Noise those are great albums. But in my opinion they could do better"
2,WEAK ALBUM,"Anthrax's albums have been getting progressively worse since Joey Belladonna left the band. White Noise was good, Stomp 442 was okay, and Volume 8 is just plain weak. There are only a few decent tracks on this c.d., not enough for me to recommend it."
4,"Good fun for fans, but not to start with","I've been a fan of Anthrax since the beginning, they were the first band I ever saw live (well, apart from the band that opened for them...) I have very much enjoyed their progression over the years, although I disagree with other reviewers who think that their earlier stuff was more thrashy - ""Spreading the Disease"", and ""Among the Living"" featured a fantastic blend of melody and hard rhythm that never, ever ages. The last three albums have been much more stomping, and rhythmic (Charlie Benante the drummer now writes most of the music and even plays guitar - unusual for a drummer) but many of the very well done melody parts have remained. Anthrax were always a fave for their sense of humour, and that is the only thing that isn't quite as apparent these days, though it is still unmistakeable (especially in the cover design...) Top band, good laughs, great to mosh along to!"
4,Decent Anthrax Album,"The first track on this is amazing, the following ones are good but not as good. I give this a 3.5 out 5, because; like Stomp 442 there's some great stuff on this but then again there are songs that don't stick in my mind."
1,what the hell is this garbage?,"This is utterly awful....riffs so thin and pathetic they make Bush look like Overkill, this album wallows in uncreative swill. The guitarist sounds like he just picked up his instrument a week before, and the fact of the matter is, any band having to hire a guy to guest to play guitar solos (Dimebag Darell) is utterly pathetic. The songwriting is nonexistent, if at best poor...only about 1 song is impressive, Catharsis...the others should be pissed on!!!"
1,One original though please,This album was terrible. The only thing good about it was that I got it for free and didn't feel guilty throwing it in the garbage. Punk? You gotta be kidding me. These guys are just an 80's metal band.
2,"Very weak, at best.","Where's the thrash? It's gone, folks. Anthrax is now and ever shall be a wuss band."
5,The Best Anthrax Album Ever.,"No more are the days when Scott Ian and the boys write about comic books & Indians. They write about the stuff going on in there lives and that makes the most agressive, emotional and powerful music. This is one of the BEST albums in my very large collection. Buy this album NOW. You will not be disappointed. BEST TRACK:#2 ""Catharasis"""
5,Most underrated band ever!,"Anthrax are quite simply the best metal band of all time. I know people will argue with that, but their last three albums have been incredibly heavy and consistently good. I bought this album when it came out and have listened to it quite often since then. Very good from beginning to end. Don't expect to hear any of these songs on rock radio, because they don't have the nuts to play them. This is rock the way it should be! Metalsludge Rules!!!!!!!"
4,Anthrax is always loyal to Thrash Metal,Big improvement! Updated Thrash metal not Alternative-like metal by Metallica! I feel sorry for myself because of being a loyal fan of Metallica though they turned away from metal. Every song in this album is ass-kicking. Get this CD of you love Thrash metal.
4,This album deserves some credit,"Third best Anthrax album of all-time, following close behind Sound Of White Noise and State of Euphoria. Quite an improvement over Stomp 442, an album which was nothing but noise. Catharsis tops this album as best song and A Toast to the Extras is a little taste of something different, and hell, that's good. Not different like Metallica different (ex. Selling out and playing wussy B.S.), but different like an experiment to temporarily deviate from their regularly powerful sound. Harm's Way is another fist clenching headbanger. If you're an Anthrax fan, you NEED to check out this album. Anthrax just keeps spreading their disease, may they keep infecting metal fans for years to come."
4,Everybody fails to mention that Dimebag Darrel contributes on this album.,"This was the first Anthrax album I bought, I thought it was awesome. Not too much to say, other than it rocks most of the time. Oh yeah, Dimebag throws in licks on a couple of songs which is reason enough to buy it."
3,pretty solid anthrax album,i remembered this album being awsome. but its not all that good. but it has some good songs on it. but i believe the best songs on it are actually on attack of killer a's
4,Anthrax?,"I have been an Anthrax fan since the early eighties. I still can't figure out how Metallica has always been more popular. Anthrax, with John Bush on vocals, is in my opinion what metal is all about. Anthrax never falls into that cookie cutter thrash riffing, or lyrics about some science-fiction fantasy that you can't relate to. No, Anthrax have been and will always be a bunch of regular guys, putting out some of the best sounding, never taking themselves too serious, metal out there. I find Metallica more one-dimentional than Anthrax. Volume 8, in my opinion, along with Stomp 442 (I know many may disagree), are Anthrax and metals finest moments...Enjoy!"
4,Never used to like it.,"At first I didn't like Vol 8 but after several listens it got better. It's mostly hit and miss throughout. It's a lot better than Stomp 442, in my opinion. It's heavier and has more variety. Crush! is an excellent opening track, 3 following tracks are also great. It isn't anywhere near their best but it;s mostly solid and a step up from Stomp 442. Not that it was a bad album but oo many songs sounded the same."
4,This book is also great for Martial Artists,"Ohashi's work clarifies the placement, use, and properties of meridian lines and pressure points. It is also very easy to read and follow, yet very thourough in its coverage of detail. A most excellent begining for any martial artist looking to expand their knowledge in pressure points or those interested in mastering Shiatsu... or perhaps both! Also a favorite of Mr. George Dillman - How about that for a sponsor!"
2,Very Disappointed,"after only 2 years some of the handles started coming loose. these aren't cheap, so i expected them to last, but no. i have an older silverware set with similar handles that's incomplete, but they're vintage and they will never break--very well crafted. it's true, they don't 'em like they used to."
2,Mediocrity rules,"Only appreciating the group in seldom potent bursts, this EP was a poor decision, littered with sub-par electro-rock scraps and fan-catering, whino-politico to the exclusion of any one significant track, although there are some undeniably good moments."
3,LE TIGRE ON THE PROWL,"I am in amour with this band and believe Kathleen Hannah to be one of the most innovative artists around. Le Tigre is an amazing fusion of punk, 80's and old skool beats. A sense of advocacy is felt in their songs as well. One song on the new album addresses the Amiallo case (spelled right?) where in NY a guy was shot over 20 times by the cops. Needed? I think not. This album is at times powerful , the remixes are good but as a whole just not as strong as their last album. I recommend owning it just as I will recommend owning anything Kathleen Hannah has worked on i.e. Bikini Kill."
3,"Great group, but more experimental offering","I've really gotten into Le Tigre and gotten pretty comfortable with the enormous range in styles from the dance-pop infectious TKO to the electronica-influenced Dyke March 2001 and softer but smart Well, Well, Well. From the Desk of Mr. Lady seems to push the boundaries, and is much more raw than most of their other works. It's worth getting to complete your collection, but it would probably be a lot harder to love this EP if you're only familiar with a few of Le Tigre's more popular songs. I still give them a lot of credit for creating some unique sounds and channeling some anger into an edgier compilation. ""Hardcore"" comes to mind in describing this one."
2,"A Step Down, and Hopefully Just a Brief One","Don't let this be your introduction to Le Tigre. If you don't have anything from them yet, pick up their AMAZING self-titled debut LP. This EP is somewhat mediocre. The songs aren't too stand-out - some forgetable, some kinda awkward. It ends with a remix of ""The The Empty"" (a great song off their first album) that doesn't pack the punch of the original and offers no new twist, which is also a pretty good summery of the entire record. Le Tigre is capable of better and I look forward to their next release."
2,Sight and sound mismatch,"The seven classical selections comprising the audio portion of this DVD are very listenable, but viewing exotic African wildlife dragging freshly torn raw meat across the Serengeti Plain is disburbing, and probably not what Wagner had in mind."
4,"101 Ways to Work Out on the Ball: Sculpt Your Ideal Body with Pilates, Yoga and More",This book is well written and photographed. Instructions are easy to follow. I really liked the combinations of disciplines used in this book. Great addition to my workout room.
5,"the best, with pictures for every workout!","I really enjoy reading this book because it gives a description of how to do the workout, how to position your body, what muscles your working, and even shows a picture of Ms. Elizabeth Gilles posing on the ball for every 101 workouts! I have tried most of these workouts on my ball at work, I work at Curves, and I really enjoy them, I even show my customers a few workouts on the ball and they enjoy them too! I makes me look smart!"
4,Pretty good,"This book has colored pictures that are large and easy to follow. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. The exercises are labeled as beginner, all levels, advanced, etc. There are variations to many exercises, which is great. Overall I am happy with my purchase."
4,Very Pleased!!!,I am very pleased with the book. My wife and I both enjoy working out together and like the step by step directions as well as the detailed photos. Using it to stay fit and it's fun!
2,"Crappy game, but I loved it","In my opinion this is a very crappy game. The graphics, gameplay, and soundtrack are appalling even for the time. However, I bought this fully knowing what it was because I remember playing it as a kid and thinking it was the best game ever because you were in SPIKY RACE CARS battling with GRENADES and ROCKETS! (and frisbee discs)"
1,Cheap & Lame - Doesn't even fit gas valve,"1 piece thin stamped soft metal. Doesn't even fit the gas valves here in Southern Calif. Well, it will turn the valve on or off, but the size is totally wrong, and about 1/4"" too big to properly fit the valve. If you use it a few times, it probably won't work anymore as it will wear out the too-big wrench hole. The zip tie is too short, but has the interesting & reusable feature of releasing when yanked on (a good feature). Pretty lame, but slightly better than nothing if you want to turn the gas off real quickly.I'd actually look for a different model, unless your gas main valve is a lot bigger than what we have here in Los Angeles."
4,Great Headset,I purchased 5 of these headsets and they work great for my office. We are a busy eyedoctor's office and it makes it easier to be on our computers and be talking on the phone with our patients. The only complaint we have is that the headset and earpiece does get uncomfortable after a while but we just change to the other ear. The handset lifer is a must if you need to be moving around.
4,"good, but not great","I've always been a fan of Plantronics for workhorse office gear. But they are starting to show their age. The headset is a bit too heavy so comfort is not ideal for long sessions. The max loudness is also not quite enough if your office is slightly noisy.I've been using GN Netcom (Jabra bought them out) headsets for past 3 yrs too, and I find they are comparatively lighter, louder, and just as clear. They also have status light on base station for MUTE so you know exactly when you are on mute. The Plantronics set have an audible beep for MUTE, but I always find myself wondering if I really am..."
4,Plantronics and Cisco IP phone,"This cordless headset with handset lifter works well with the Cisco 7942 IP phone. It does take some initial settings but that goes quickly. Between the earpieces and over the head piece, my office people have found an earpiece that suits them. I highly recommend this unit as it allows our team to answer calls even when they are walking in the office."
3,Good sound quality,"This headset has very good sound quality, and is somewhat comfortable to wear. My only complaint is the difficulty setting the microphone volume so that the people you are speaking to can hear you loud enough without me hearing a very distracting echo in my ear. I have had this unit for about 4 weeks now and I still find myself messing with the volume control daily."
4,very good headpiece,"this is a vary nice headset. i did get a little back ground noise, but the sound quality is really nice. i would recommend this piece."
4,Wireless Headset best thing,This headset just allows me the freedom to move around and not be tied to a desk while on the phone with customers. The range is more then enough and allows me to move freely within the office and other ares.
1,Great product but doesn't work,"This headset does not communicate well with the phone. It was shipped nicely, but the connection is slow to answer and does not hang up when you press the button. I am trying to figure it out still, but very dissatisfied with my purchase."
4,Pretty cool,So far this product is working well. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't always lift the hand set on internal calls when I push the button. Works everytime when it is a call from the outside.
2,The blew it on the earpiece,"I bought one of these when I saw them at another office. I used it briefly and thought it was great so I bought my own. The hardware and sound quality is good, but I'm giving it only two stars because Plantronics blew it on the over the ear headsets and general design flaws. The over the ear attachments are horrible. They should be of Jabra quality, the kind you can wear all day long. Instead they are cheap flimsy plastic that are not strong enough to keep on your ear or support the microphone. Switching to the over the head attachment is not much better as it grips a little too hard, causing it to be noticeable right away and painful over time.The headset lifter is also large for what it does and it ""glues"" onto your phone. I was surprised that was how it was designed. Poor execution in my opinion.For ~$240 I expect this product to have great quality and excellent design. Unfortunately they only got part of the equation right."
3,Better than the rest,"Overall, the item is good. The instructions on how to modify the sound quality could be clearer.On the down side: beware of cell phones. If my Moto Q is between the transmitter and the headset, funny things and very poor quality happen.The onther down side: the company that shipped it (this does NOT come from Amazon) did not send the lifter and I am getting tired of fighting them for it."
2,Misrepresentation,"I believe the script misrepresented the product to my application. Alot of hype no substance. Their are compatibility issues with softphone/computer application, without hard phone. Item returned and credit given"
1,Diasppointed,I purchased this product for stock. We put it in service last week and I feel this is used and returned or seconds. This product has unusable sound quality. We have 10 of the same units I purchased from the products website. I tried Amazon and this is going to be my last time. I'm trying to get this unit repaired from Plantronics. Amazon stated this was a new product.
5,Plantronics CS55/HL10 Wireless Headset Bundle,"These headsets are the greatest! Saves you from getting a neck ache trying to hold the phone receiver between your ear and your neck. Plus, we can walk around the office and never miss a call. We love them!"
4,Love this item!,"I have personally purchased two of these headsets thus far, and we have three others within our organization. I find it to be very easy to set up, although it can take a bit to fine tune the sound, echo, etc. There are several different ear pieces and a headgear, so it is almost impossible to not find a comfortable fit. I love being able to use both hands while talking on the phone, and also being able to get up and go look at something while on the phone. I would suggest this for anyone that needs to be typing, looking through files, or going to another area of the office while on the phone."
5,money well spent,"After surviving the remarks about how silly I looked wearing this thing, I found out that within 2 weeks multiple coworkers had helped themselves to use this thing on my days off. My neck feels 100% better at the end of the day and the battery does truly last all day at my job. Took a little adjustment at first to get used to the earpiece but this thing goes right at the top of the list of items I feel gave me value for every dollar. Now the boss wants me to order 3 more units for everyone else in the department. I can literally walk over 50 feet from the unit and no cutout or loss in clarity. You need this if you like to pinch your head to your shoulder and talk on the phone. I have now had cervical disk replacement surgery which I might not have needed if I had been using this before."
2,very difficult to hear and not all the comfortable to wear,"I've had this unit for awhile now and barely use it due to how it sounds and feels while wearing it.If you're in a noisy environment and have others talking around you, having a single ear system can be difficult to stay focused on what is being told to you.I work doing customer support and I just can't do my job with a single-ear system. Volume level is low (even though it is cranked up all the way).Comfort-wise you have the option to use a hook-around-the-ear system or the headband (which is what I end up using).I only use this headset when I am stuck on a call but need to walk away from my desk (nature breaks, etc).It does have excellent range, allowing me to go a few hundred feet away from the base unit in my building.The lifter mechanism is just goofy and doesn't interface that well with the Cisco phones we have.I'm hoping the dual-ear headset works better for me."
5,Works when I work!!!,Wireless headset great for the doctors office. Allows me the freedom I need to multi-task.
1,Serious Issues With Audio Cutting Out,"We have about six people in our department with this headset and lifter bundle. A couple of them have no issues, however the majority of us have constant problems with audio cutting out. It doesn't seem to matter how much of a charge is on the headset or how close we are to the base, the audio will just cut out at random times. This device is totally unusable to me because of these problems, even after trying two different units, ordering a third brand new, and trying a new phone as well. I've had very good luck with Plantronics before, however this product is unusably bad."
4,"Works OK for first few months, now having a litlte problem with it","Worked pretty well for the first 6 months, now having some issues, difficult to keep the phone handle from falling totally off the phone, constantly having to put papers under it or something to keep it from happening but great for the moving about the office/home."
1,Junk,"Yes, it is wireless, and I can use it with our VoIP phones. But,for something costing around $250, I expected better.The headset base station has to be 4"" away from my phone to avoid feedback with the speakerphone. Since that is about the length of the wires connecting the two devices, options for placement on the desktop become limited. The adjustment buttons are on the back and underside of the base station - not an easy place to get at, especially if you care about seeing the state of the device's charge.The handset lifter is a joke, lacking the power to return the handset to the off position if the phone is tilted up to a position where I can read its notification window. It also has to be affixed to the phone unit in a way that covers the speaker on most models, which obviates use.Finally, the provided earploops are junk."
1,Good product but was not for me,Reviews on this product were very good but there was one piece that would have likely broke easily per reviews and for this price point I decided to return it.
2,Faulty,In the beginning this product was great but the rotating tip was soon faulty.. would stop rotating for a few seconds at a time
2,Don't get this,"If you really concentrate you can sort of feel the rotation, but it's next to nothing, as for the vibration, yeah it's powerful but doesn't stay in place and the vibration is just like a motor; it does not feel good at all."
1,awful,This product is not for people who is looking for pleasure. It is a waste of money and time. You should be able to choose from different sizes then it would be a nice product. Old saying different 'strokes' for different folks.
3,"Strong writing, weak plot","Byas has a real talent, but at times his material betrays him. Occasionally, the plot lags. However, if you enjoy his other work than I do recomend this one."
1,Worst game ever!,"I have been playing video games my entire life and this game is the worst game I have ever played. You can't walk two steps without fighting an enemy and it takes hours to go through one very small castle because of this. The gameplay is horrid,and boring, the music is painfully redunant. Everything about this game sucks! I threw it in the trash!"
3,Good Game but Too Hard,"I've played alot of RPGs! RPGs are actually a preference of mine. I've practically played all of the genres on Nintendo, PlayStation, and some on CPU and Sega. This is by far the hardest I've come across though. Everything's playable till you get to Dowaine... a town across the mountains using the submarine. Once you get there, there's all these enemies that cause status effects on you and raise themselves. Besides the fact that you'll miss hitting the enemies here and there, the game gets freaking impossible from here! Whoever designed this game is an idiot! They should at least make it playable! I have an emulator on my computer where I can save wherever I want, and even then it's impossible!... morons =o("
5,"Great Tasty Recipes, Interesting Content","This book is wonderful! The recipes are tasty and are not difficult to follow. We used several for our Thanksgiving feast this year. The pumpkin pie and berry crisp are delicious! I also have enjoyed some of the less traditional treats, however, and I look forward to trying food from the Portuguese chapter.From Apple Pie to Pad Thai is also interesting to read. As someone who grew up on Boston's North Shore, I really enjoyed reading about familiar places and events. The chef profiles help bring the book to life. And I loved the tips in each chapter on local ethnic markets and restaurants."
2,Not enough Strawberry Shortcake,"I was disappointed with this book. It does have prices of some Strawberry Shortcake items, But it left a lot out. The book should have had item descriptions and release dates with the current estimated prices. The pictures are good and they included some Strawberry Shortcake items I havent seen before. But they left out some rare dolls. The book only had information on 1/4 of the items that were on the market. I felt this book could have been better written and could have included more items."
1,Not a great book!,"There are literally thousands of Strawberry Shortcake items. This book only covers about 100 of them, and then wastes several pages showcasing fake Strawberry Shortcake Dolls. It is a waste of time to order this book and a waste of money to buy it."
2,Not so great....,"Unlike other versions, this book does have all the dolls and playsets, but the the presentation is poor. A few of the pictures are hard to see, and the layout is inconsistent. Also, I would like to see more info in the captions, not just name and price. I would also like more prices for other items, as this book only covers toys and a few other items."
3,Mild improvement from version 1-,"Well, with slight improvements, the guide has more of the doll collections and miniatures although not all inclusive- the dolls shown are in much better condition- most of which was new in box or still on package (MOC). There is a lot of wasted area. For example, she has some pages with just 2 or 3 pictures of toys; inventory is still disorganized but an improvement from the original SSC Collector book. The price guide is off based rom ebay and online prices but alittle closer to toy collector shows and expos. A lot of the pictures seem to be repeats from the first book as well. On the positive side, I still enjoyed looking at the amazing toys that I once owned and collected as a child."
1,Sound Quality if Pretty Bad,"man, the sound is horrible on this cd. i love benny golson, but i also love good sound. sounds like someone recorded this in the audience.the sound is awful."
5,Outstanding Japanese Green Tea!,"With it's wonderful flavor, aroma and color, this tea is an outstanding buy. You can pay more, but you will be hard-pressed to find an all around better Japanese Green Tea. Outstanding!"
1,Watch out for this Carafe,"After a few weeks of use this carafe will shatter all by itself just sitting on your kitchen counter. I replaced the first one thinking my bad luck, the replacement also shattered. This is a loud explosion sound resulting in a carafe full of shattered glass, and hot coffee running out the bottom of the carafe. I think dealers will lose dollars selling a service contract on this baby. Product deserves zero stars."
3,A so-so read.,"Lorraine Heath's story gets my vote as the best of the bunch, although it is rather short to be memorable. The others are forgettable. If not for Heath, this book will get two stars."
5,OBSOLETE: hardly.,"thiS (nexT tO digimortaL) iS thE BEST cD eveR madE!thE songS arE easY tO geT in-tO, anD althougH feaR factorY waS alreadY thE besT, ObSoLeTe onlY proveS theM eveN betteR!thiS albuM iS constantlY spinninG (wheneveR digimortaL is not) anD haS beeN a favoritE oF minE sincE i boughT iT, iT wilL neveR diE!"
4,Great.,"Wow. This is Fear Factory's best album yet. It starts slowly with Shock, but Shock soon becomes a heavy track. Then 'Due to the graphic nature of this programme, listner discretion is advised' Edgecrusher springs into action with deafening guitar riffs and one of Cristian's funky basslines. Smasher/Devourer is next, with an agressive style all the way through, Police state 2000 follows in similar style, but with a bit more tune. Descent is next, quite tuneful, not as heavy as the rest but still a good listen, followed by the deafening Hi-Tech Hate in which the drumming is wild. Next is Freedom Or Fire, a powerful metal song with good riffs, followed by the excellent title track, Obsolete. Next is the tuneful Ressurection, marking the end of the machines. The only thing that spoils the album is the trash-track Timlessness, which really belongs on a Westlife album.Other than Tmelessness, though, a great album. If you like Slipknot's WAIT & BLEED, you'll like this album."
2,"Ok, but repetitive and uninspired...","I bought this album expecting a heavy metal band. In this respect, the album doesn't dissapoint. The problem is it's too heavy. It falls into all the typical heavy metal cliches. The lead vocalist growls all the lyrics, while the guitar tries to drown him out. There simply isn't much inspiration here. Most of the songs lack any type of melody,and are devoid of solos. All in all the album sounds mostly the same all throughout, with the exception of a few songs. Track 10 really stands out, because it dares to be different. The guitars arn't going full bore, so you can actually hear the vocalist SING. The string section really adds to it as well. Supposedly there's a theme to this album, but since I can't understand most of the lyrics, I'm completely missing out on it. Don't get me wrong, this band has potential, but for now they're nothing special."
4,sorry for my misspellins,"im sorry i misspelled a bunch of stuff in my review i was drunk or tired or something, and i meant to put this is the first death metal band that i have listend to"
1,Plain bad,"Heavy metal should contain powerfully emphatic muted chord progressions that do not chug along, thumping base lines and heavy drumming, however good metal also contains variations in chord usage, textured and melodious bass lines and drum loops and fills that aren't monotonous, throw in some lead solos and some variation in lead vocals in between songs and you have heavy metal. This album lacks any of these qualities. Not even worth 1 star."
4,Heavy Slab Of Concept Industrial,"This album is great. You have your classic Fear Factory(""Shock"", ""Smasher/Devourer""), some rap-metal(""Edgecrusher""), radio stuff(""Descent""), and a masterpiece(""Resurrection""). However, Fear Factory's Obsolete just lacks something that Demanufacture had. It could be the speed. It could be the use of synths. It could be the double bass drumming. That's okay, though. Unfortunately, Obsolete can't match its follow-up, either. Digimortal, their 'sellout' album, has unbelievable double bass, melodic singing, and an interesting flirtation with hip-hop. Although the guitar and bass riffs are very simple and the lyrics and rapping childish, it's still beter than Obsolete. Obsolete just is missing SOMETHING between those two extremes. All in all, great album, and the concept story behind it is hauntingly mesmerizing. It just misses where Demanufacture and Digimortal don't."
4,Fear Factory show they are here to last!!,"When bands like Coal Chamber and others release one off wonders (not that I was impressed, but still..) it is nice to hear a band which shows that it is continuing to grow and mature and live...wow, these guys were awsome in London!!! Obsolete is their best album so far, the songs show nice progression and work. Those of you who gave this one star doing it a great injustice, yeah, not a classic, but worth a damn good mosh!!!"
5,Amazing!,"I am an avid metal fan, mostly cosisting of bands loke Metallica, Pantera, Tool, and Megadeth. OBSOLETE was my first foray into the ""harder"" scene, and it would be an understatement to say I was impressed. This album is a collection of finely tuned, powerful songs of anger and agression. At first, I was annoyed at how Burton Bell changes his voice in the middle of a song. But after listening to it more, the contrasting styles put an original spin on it and set the band out from other cliched metal bands of our time. This is a must buy! After listening to it, I am convinced I have to get all the rest of FF's CDs! Truly, an amazing album!"
3,original obsolete gets a 5. this one3.,This limited edition wasn't much of an edition at all. the added tracks are boring and cars is just a plain poser song. the only good song in my opinion that was added is Messiah(look for it on the upcoming video game of the same name)
4,Some definate tracks to headbang to,"I was blown away by the raw heavyness and precision of Edgecrusher. Fear Factory has expanded their musical talent as well by writing songs such as Decent. While I agree with the majority that demanufacture is a better album, this still is a must-have for anyone ready to get angry and break stuff."
4,powerful... heavy,"A fantastic development for Fear Factory. A concept album which tells the story of a future world, aggressive opening tracks `Shock' and `Edgecrusher' telling the tale of the fight against oppression culminating in the sad finale `Timelessness'. The story behind the fantastic tracks is an important one, technology does not replace spirituality. And `Ressurection' is one helluva track."
5,Great techno/thrash CD,"I have always said that heavy synthesizer could work within the confines of metal, and belatedly I investigated Fear Factory and found I was right. Their second album ""Demanufacture"", which now comes with ""Remanufacture"", the remix album, is considered a cornerstone work. ""Obsolete"" carries the vibe of ""Demanufacture"" and adds some surprises, mainly a faithful cover of Gary Numan's ""Cars"" and a downright pretty song, ""Timelessness"", which is haunting and touching. Hooray for Fear Factory for breaking the rules.The rest of the CD is classic FF, with Dez' guitars hammering away with the subtlety of a jackhammer on your forehead and Burton Bell's amazing vocal capabilities, from a gutteral roar to downright melodic. His is probably one of the most powerful voices in rock today.""Obsolete"" could easily be timely and still just as heavy 100 years from now, along with Voivod, another great futuristic metal band."
5,Great Great cd,"Well there isnt much more to say that already hasnt been said.Burton has a great voice,goes heavy then goes into a singing voice.such a great cd.every song is good,there is no bad song. this is a cd i could listen to over and over again,and still enjoy"
5,This cd kicks!!!!!!,"The base in the song descent makes my ears throb at a low level. The music is great and it has many diffrent types of rock. Slow metal fast industrial you name it , it has it."
5,Wow!,"Wow! New metal music that's actually worth spending your money on! Most metal nowadays sucks, but Fear Factory is one exception. I got DEMANUFACTURE a year and a half ago, and it didn't click well with me for the first time, so I gave it back. Then I hated Fear Factory until one day I was posessed by a force beyond my own (as corny as that may sound...) to buy OBSOLETE. Well, I did, and I haven't regretted it since! I like his singing voice much better than his growl, but he can do both very well. I'd like to hear more singing from him in the future. They keyboards by Rhys Fulber compliment the music very well and that's another thing that enticed me (being a huge industrial music fan). Well, now that I'm a fan, I'm going back to the used music store to reclaim DEMANUFACTURE!..."
5,Breaking new ground in industrial metal.,"This album is everything that industrial metal should be. Gut-punching guitar riffs, almost inhuman drumming (check out Shock), and actual singing not just mindless bellowing which has plagued heavy metal for years. This album (like Demanufacture before it) is almost laid out like a movie, every song tells a story in an ungoing saga that ends at the remarkably put together last track. It is that kind of creativity that has been seriously lacking in the metal world. Any other reasons for getting this? Sure, if for no other reason, buy it because it rocks like none other. Play it loud and you can't help but thrash around, it gets your adrenaline pumping like you wouldn't believe. Best tracks: Shock, Descent, and Resurrection."
2,Replica of Demanufacture,"This album is dissapointing, tracks sound like leftovers from the last album. Nothing new here folks!"
3,disappointment,I had bought Demanufacture 4 months ago and loved the intensity of all the songs. I must say I was disappointed with Obsolete. I thought that Bell sang just a little much rather than screaming like a wildcat. The one bright spot that I have heard on the CD is SHOCK...
1,A bland mess!!,"This has to be the most bland, generic metal album ever made. With a few exceptions EVERY song sounds just as disorganized and distorted as the one before it. These guys really need to tone it down some. Blah!! Avoid this group. They give metal a bad name."
1,Lame,Save your time and money.Buy Metallica instead. You'll be much happier. This group needs some TALENT.
1,seek therapy,If this is your idea of a good time...seek therapy..I've heard better sounding jack hammers
5,this cd RULEZ!,"thiz cd iz 1 of the best, it has many good songs on it, i love the bass guitar and lead guitar, and i love the vocals too,well i love the whole cd, its just a great cd and one of my fav's"
4,well this one was a tiny bit dissapointing,i'm sorry but this album is more mellow than the others but i have faith in fear factory they won't lose ther touch
5,great allaround album,"This album kicked @$$ and was one of the great albums of 98. With its hardcore-bass filled-industrial metal sound, it just rocked. This album was reviewed as the best metal album of the year and is well worth the price that you will pay for it. The band has little to no radio airplay (except for a rip off the remanufacture album played on Q101 (chicago)) and still made a great impression on everybody. This album with its sales rate shows what a truely great band can do with a great album."
4,Hits Hard But Has a Melody to It,"This is really the first ""deathmetal"" or w/e type of band, i usually listen to all kinds of music just about except country, well neways on wit tha review, i liked this album, ive had it for bout 5 days n listened to it over 10 times, i gave it 4 stars because a cppl of the songs sound the same, the remake of the Cars song is good but it shouldnt of been included on the album cuz it just seems out of text a little bit, but i still like it, my fav songs on here are Edgecrusher,smasher/devouruer, securation, and obsolute"
3,Good have been better,"Burton C. Bell is one of the best lyric writters in the metal genre today, but sadly, he rarely ever puts them to good use. Instead of singing, he growls and screams most of them. In Timelessness and Cars he actually sings and is good, and then I hear the other songs and I'm just like ""Man, you can sing, so why don't you?"" And what I REALLY like about him is that he doesn't swear. He can write kick ass lyrics and not swear. There's only one swear word in the entire CD, on Shock. As for the music, it was pretty good. I think they sound a little too much alike for my taste. The best ones are Shock, Edgecrusher, Descent, Timelessness, and Cars, the rest mainly sound the same and blends in too many of the instruments at a time, kinda sounding like Slayer in one point. I also like how the whole CD (without the extra tracks) tells a story. I found that concept really cool. Overall good, but could have been a lot better."
1,Theres heaps better than this,"Although this band have become quite popular (possibly comercialised), the fact that there music is quite bland and un-thought provoking is a turn off. Each song is structured in almost the exact same fashion, the (Ever repeating throughout almost every song) choruses mostly consist of an ever annoying boring unmelodius attempt at singing and the technologically assisted drumming does not add any credibility to the album.Type O Negative and Machine Head are both solid bands with uniqueness, Fear Factory are simply overplayed and over-rated."
4,Good album,"Well, this is Fear Factory at its best! I think that this is some great hardcore industrial music. With raging guitars, spine snapping drum beats, decent vocals, and great bass, just imagine how they must be in concert.This edition of the album also features bonus tracks, such as ""Cars"", a mellow cover song. You might recognize it from the credit card commercials.Anyway, good album overall. Only complaint is that some of the songs sound the same. I'm looking forward to Fear Factory's next album."
3,Can he sing? NO. Can he growl? YEEEEESSSSS!,"If he didn't try to sing in this album, I might give it four stars. But.....we just aren't that lucky now are we? Do us all a favor. scream and growl about social supression all you want....but leave the vocals to someone with....well.... a voice. Thats all I ask."
2,Nowhere near heavy enough.,"It seems to me that the once great Fear Factory has lot the plot. Although they never were extreme Death Metal, even on ""Soul of a New Machine,"" this CD is weak. If you want something that's really heavy, try Living Sacrifice or Zao."
1,Singer is terrible.,"This is the WORST vocals i've heard in my life. My friend lent me this and I was expecting something at least half decent, but this was horrible. No talent nowhere in this group."
5,KILLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is awesome, especially with the bonus of ""Cars"" with Gary Neuman doing (some) of the vocals. If your neighbors are really angering you, pop this in and play on 11 until the cops come and laugh when they hand you a ticket!Brutal follow up to any of their previous releases!A+!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not bad,"I heard the cd from a person I know, and I felt it was just ok. I love heavy music but there was something about fear factory that just makes them ok. One the other hand I love their name Fear Factory and the song ressurection is pretty awesome. Buy it if you are really into really hard heavy metal, but if your not sure hold off."
1,Ressurection of crud,"For real intense music thats heavier then this crud, Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere by the awesome band Meshuggah totally S&*% on this poser metal release. Yep Meshuggah combine damn heavy riffing with intricate and polyrhythmic song structures and quite complex yet intriguing time changes into their compositions, and oh yeh, their drummer is far superior to this fatso and doesnt need to engineer his drum tracks using a drum machine to play fast and try play cool. Fredrik Thorendal's guitar skills will also blow dino out of the water, but i guess this ones for all the cool teenyboppers out there who reckon theyre hot stuff by listening to this crud. This band will be long forgotten once all the hype is over and all you sheep find another bandwagon to jump on."
1,Elton John is better than this drivel,"This album is mindless. It has no focus, no point, and most importantly no talent. The lead singer is capable of carrying a tune, but rarely does. Screaming the ENTIRE time does not make for very engaging listening. Also, the music itself is incredibly repetitive. Half the songs sound just like the one before. Yes this album is very heavy, but no it is not good just for that reason. I could make a heavy metal album by screeching away on a guitar even though I have no talent at it, but it wouldn't be a good album. This cd is devoid of any solos, due to the fact that they're probably incapable of it. My point in all this is, AVOID THIS ALBUM. The only reason anyone's even heard of these guys is cause of the Korn Family Values tour. Oh yeah and maybe because of the bland Cars remake that's on the credit card commercials......"
1,OH MY GOD,"This album gets one star for cars. that's IT. when i first heard that song...i instantly knew i had found the perfect industrial band. heavy riffs, but very melodic. in cars, the sound of the guitar is JUST how i like it, and the dude's voice is absolutely perfect. i LOVE that song. but noooo...when i pick up this album, all i hear is a bunch of friggin screaming, a barrage of drums and a solid wall of guitar. it SUCKS. it sounds exactly like slipknot. down with fear factory. down with slipknot. GO SYSTEM OF A DOWN!"
4,not exatcly the heaviest......,an awesome cd. great metal and all. but as far as heavy goes....Cannibal Corpse blasts them away. Cars is the best track for me. Like the whole techno beat to it..........and thats good enough
4,Awesome Album,"Fear Factory did a great job with this album and I would recommend it to anyone who likes metal.Vocals: The primary vocals are great.The backup ones are not near as good, but still decent.Guitars: Good job, strong and loud.Bass: A little repetitive, but flows and sounds exceptionally well with the rest of the album.Drums: Somewhat basic at times but works very well.The bonus songs aren't anything great, but I would recommend getting them anyway.My favorite songs are Edgecrusher, Shock, and Obsolete."
3,ULTIMATE EDITION OF A TIME HONORED CLASSIC,"This one was kind of a treat for me, as I'm primarily a fan of American comics over manga. So this hybrid of American-style storytelling with insets by the original Japanese artist (Koichi Ohata, for those of you who DON'T already know!) was something truly original.The action is virtually non-stop, and the art is crisp. There are some great scenes of violence, and a bodacious chick as well.However, the REAL treat is in the bonus materials in the back of the book, chock full of Koichi Ohata's original concept drawings. You hardly ever see this stuff in manga titles, so this was a real treat.Worth checking out , especially if you're a fan of Marvel & DC comics."
2,broke almost immediately,"After two showers the ""misting knob"" on the left broke and now only clicks when we try to use it. The knob on the right still works fine and so that's ok if you want to switch between a pulsating flow and a steady flow...but the misting feature is why I really bought it.I've contacted Amazon and hopefully they'll be helpful about this--kind of a disappointing Christmas present for my husband."
2,Older model better,"The older model has a showerhead which allows a 360 degree rotation to adjust height/ angle. This model does not, and is poor for shorter individuals. The powersaver filter reducesless mist and strength of the massage. The hand-held cord is bulky and gets in the way..."
3,Not thrilled,"This shower head is ok, but not something I'd buy again. During installation, the connector on the hose cracked. We had to contact Waterpik to obtain a replacement hose. That took a couple of weeks. Once we got it installed, it operates ok. I'm not sure yet whether we'll leave it in or just go back to our old 'standard' spray head. The volume of water throughput had much better force on the old one."
4,Misting shower head,"WaterPik does deliver all the functionality the product claims, and that is the widest assortment of sprays ever packed into one shower head. That is why the shower head is quite large and requires some extra effort to select a spray mode from the many available, particularily in the pre-8AM hours. The misting option does produce a very fine steam-like mist, but after turning the knob about a dozen times to fully engage that mode, you must also increase the hot water to regain a warm shower. It is more involved than the standard model, which has spoiled us for years. The only complaint is that the spray select knob is small and somewhat difficult to turn with soap on it, or with a week grip."
2,Silver Bullet,"The book is quite confusing to follow, and I found the description slightly misleading. It doesn't actually come with two MCAT tests. You must do the tests online through AAMC and follow along in the book. One is free and the other costs $35 through AAMC. Also, AAMC offers explanations for all their answers already on the practice test, so this is kind of overkill..."
2,"explanations pedestrian, but at least available","silver bullet offers solutions for the lowest common denominator. very basic explanations, often verbose yet incomplete. the extraneous practice questions are not very challenging. this book should *only* be used as an appendage to the more substantial princeton/kaplan reviews. i suggest you buy this book only if you are in dire need of solutions for aamc tests 1 or 2."
4,Soulful,This isn't a CD with only a few songs that are good. The entire CD is good! The slow songs with Nicol's soulful voice are wonderful.
4,great history lessons,"this book was assigned to a class i had in college 3 years ago. the class was Racial and Ethnic Groups which was a Sociology class. It gives excellent, well-written essays on various racial/ethnic groups. The book is truly a must have. This book unlike others gives an account of many groups in the U.S."
3,Book review,"i received the book, The item was described as having no rips or tears, however it had a few tears on the bottom. the item also said minor highlights, however at least half the book is highlighted. other than that i had no problems"
1,Torture,"This book is the equivalent of someone taking interesting information, dropping it in the dirt, overcooking it using absolutely no seasoning and serving it with a side of vinegar. Awful...boring, verbally monotonous and it completely murders any interest one might have in this subject of immigration, race or sociology. There's no vocabulary highlights, no chapter summary, minimal black & white pictures, teeny tiny text, no interesting history or anecdotes explaining the fluffed up & often unnecessary verbiage. Just terrible. To be fair, I haven't even finished the first chapter..I'm so irritated and frustrated by the total lack of personality that I had to stop to vent before I've even finished to stop myself from either falling asleep or throwing this book across the room. Btw, this is required for a college Sociology class I'm taking and thus far I'm an A student."
4,Ultimate Bridal Shower Guide Very Helpful,"This book was very helpful because I hadn't been to a bridal shower in a very long time and I had never thrown one myself, so I needed some guidance! The book gave great ideas for menus, themes, favors, etc. All things I was having a hard time getting started with. Once I read the book it got my creative juices flowing and made the planning much easier and fun!"
5,A book that really helps!,"This is the finest book I've read on handling difficult people. As a training director for a large company, I've read many books on this subject, and trained interpersonal skills for years. This book is the CLEAREST, most practical book on the subject.The ten types of difficult people are now in my vocabulary, and help me instantly size up a situation so I can handle it better. The authors detail practical steps to take with each style, making it easier to increase your confidence in difficult situations.Most of all the authors encourage the reader to change his or her behavior, and the last chapter even offers the idea of the reader being a difficult person, in order to further reinforce the skills that this book teaches.A real winner, and a book that has helped my career and my sanity."
4,How to deal with stress-inducing people,"I read this book as part of a college course on professional communication and I can honestly say it's helped me to deal with my coworkers much better. The authors divide the book into sections dealing with one of ten possible behaviors that represent people at their worst. Their advice is sound and is often accompanied by real life anecdotes from those who field-tested this advice. I would easily recommend it to anyone, especially those in management positions or in human resources."
1,dealing with book presentations you can't stand,"A lot of good reviews for the book, and I find the contents are helpful. But I made a horrible mistake and bought the audio version.The authors skimped on the production and instead of getting an actor, they decided to present the book themselves. They have a tag-team approach which they're obviously having fun with, but as they're flipping back and forth word by word and finishing each other's sentences, it is incredibly distracting. One of the authors has a great impersonation of a weasely person you can't stand. Unfortunately, that's his real voice and the nasal delivery completely discredits the content of his words.I can say the book is OK, but don't buy the audio version!"
3,Dealing with people you can't stand,"I got bored and stopped reading it think I may try in in hard copy rather then kindle, depending on the price"
4,It makes you think...,...and any book that can do that is worth something. The authors have focused their descriptions on the most common problem behaviors. The most striking thing you will see in the book is your own behavior. You will recognize a bit of yourself in this book. Problem people will be less evil to you and appear more human as you understand what is motivating the behavior. Seeing them as basically good is a wonderful way to deal with people. Read this book and see problem people for who they are and the ally they can become.
3,Not bad but there are other options out there,"This book is a good introduction to the major types of annoying people and basic techniques for dealing with them. It seems to be primarily aimsed at business people. I wouldn't recommend it for those who want to improve family relationships.Other points: if you're looing for a detailed guide for dealing with difficult people in a wide variety of possible situations, this isn't a book I'd recommend. The focus is on identifying the ten most annoying people (whiners, know-it-alls, snipers, etc) along with some limited suggestions for maximizng positive communication. It is basically up to the reader to figure out how to do that in specific situations, althnougb a few examples are given throughout the book.This isn't a terrible book but it is an introductory guide at best. There are better choices out there."
3,"Good for understanding flare ups of unacceptable behavior, but not the chronically bad behaviored","This book is ok to find out how people around us might react when under pressure. The authors assume that people are basically great to be with except under stressful situations; they then become intolerable and difficult. If the people around you have chronically unacceptable behavior, however; this book will do little to help you handle or to find out what their problem is. Are they mentally ill? If so, what illness do they have and what techniques can I use to survive their behavior? What special words or phrases can I use to deal with such people?"
3,Too slow,"This is a cute video. It is fun and it feels like Elise is very into it and keeps you concentrated on what you're doing, but I have to so it's just not aerobic enough. She speeds each move up once you learn it, but even the fastest speeds weren't that great. When my pulse did get up to the fat burning zone it would drop immediately because the exercise slowed down again.I have to say I was also distracted by the overly expressive guy in super spandex shorts. It's nice to have guys involved so you can talk your boyfriend into working out with you, but why couldn't he wear pants like all the girls did?Overall the video got three stars because it was interesting to do and maybe someday I'll pull it off my shelf again."
1,Pro-Tech Atletics toe flexor,These are HORRIBLE - they are hard and impossible to wear - a complete waiste of $$$$$$$$$!!!!!
1,risers?,I did not get what I ordered so what can I say? Wrong item so don't know if would have like or not. Shippign was fast and refund fast.
1,Rip Off,Don't order this product.I orded it and all I recieved was a one piece top. No sides or compartments as shown in the picture.I contacted them a month ago and haven't recieved any response !
5,You just can't beat Boohbah,"I love Boohbah, If you have never seen Boohbah you will be glad you brought these lovable creatures into your home!Very relaxing and calming. I like to put it on right before bedtime it really sets the mood :)"
2,As annoying for adults is as entertaining for little ones,"This show borders on the scary for me.. creepy little aliens, popping in and out like mushrooms, where did they come from and where are they going next? However the kids (all under 10) are mesmerized and will almost hypnotized through the whole show. This is why we will only put it on about one time a month!"
1,bad book... sorry,I didn't enjoy this book at all. I read a little over 70 pages and couldn't continue. I found it really hard to follow. I didn't understand what was happening at all during the 70 pages I read. Maybe it got better at the end... I don't know. I honesty could not continue reading it though. This is one of the first books that I haven't been able to finish. I feel bad that I'm giving it a bad rating but it's what I honestly feel about the book. Sorry.
1,Throw your money into the wind for better effect...,"I had to give this item at least one star in order to post this review. One star is too much because I have never even seen this DVD. It is advertised that the DVD will work in the US and Canada, this is a lie. Even the package the DVD arrived in states it will work in all DVD zones... Another lie. I tried to play this DVD in three different DVD players and got error messages that the DVD was not formatted for the particular zone I'm in. Yep, and of course I can't return this because it is no longer ""unopened or in original condition""... I spent $29.95 plus $2.98 for shipping and handling for a grand total of $32.93! I would have had more fun throwing my money into the wind because at least somebody could find it and spend it as opposed to me being stuck with something I can't even sell on E-Bay."
4,Now that the DVD will play,"The DVDs are in French and English, controls select easily. Much of this is the state of the art as it was before grip fighting.As a warning, I bought this as part of the three DVD set. I have a combined TV DVD player, a Sony DVD drive/DVD player in two of my computers and a brand-new multi-spectrum Panasonic player.The DVD would not play on any of them. I have found this quite frustrating as I would very much like to see the material. I should note that the other DVDs in the set do not play either on them either. The website was not been terribly useful in obtaining help.However, the fourth computer I obtained since I received the DVDs two years ago for Christmas suddenly recognizes and plays them and I can give them four stars now.A little dated, but there is a lot of material, presented with good camera angles and precision, in combination with clear steps. This video even has some grip fighting and other advanced for the times material."
4,Nautical but Nice,especially for a 13 year old girl who wants to become a marine biologist. This is a very favorite thing that is played with often.Finish and overall painting is just a little sketchy or I'd give it five stars.
2,"Ouch, very bad game","How you play this game, is you first select a gender and enter your name, then you participate in five or six competitions... These competitions are not random, and they come in the same order. You get points for each competition you win or lose and finally climb up to the final event, the Elimanator. This could have been such a good game, if there were more events, if the events were randomized and if there were actual gladiators with unique attributes. Poor game and poor game play."
4,Interesting.,Something new with each page. THe story seemed to take twissts and turns that kept me interested. A good read for the mystery lover.
2,Didn't really connect with the characters,"I had never read anything by this author, but the story sounded interesting and the reviews were pretty good. Since the price was so low for the Kindle book, I went ahead and ordered.The book was OK, but really never captured my interest in terms of either the story or the characters. It wasn't so horrid that I didn't want to finish it, but at no time did I have a problem putting it down to go do something else.I don't anticipate trying any others by this author."
4,what a read,"This book was awesome.throughout the entire read was well thought out. You think its Nick, out at least I did.come to find out that was not the case. I really thought I had it all figured out. Then when I found out Weeks was really going on o was I shocked that it took a major turn of events.will be reading more by this author."
3,Not my usual choice,"A little predictable, and a lot of murders. I tend to stay away from dark and depressing and this was dark and depressing most of the time."
4,distraction,"My new Kindle Fire keeps flipping ahead or back in the book when I turn it on so this is distracting but the book is pretty good when I find where I left off. I'd give it a 4 starMaureen Malloy-Clifford, author of Pulled by God for Conversations with Spirit Guides"
5,"I'm not a mystery reader, but this one is a great one",I picked this up a few months ago and just got to it a week ago...It was one of those books you can't put down until the last page. It's a great read with twist and turns that are unexpected. I hate reading books and being able to predict what is going to happen before the author spells it out for you. This one will keep you guessing and you won't have a clue. It's well written and my hat is to the author. Thanks for a book that kept me captivated.
3,books,"Really can't remember this book, bought for the .99 cent offering, don't want to say much more, it was so long ago."
3,Innovative must play.,"This game was unknown to me until I saw it on [...] list of great non-famous games. Very different style of play for a platformer to increase your magic and life you have to build towns in between the levels which is fun and rewarding to see your work on the overworld map. The platforming is solid if uninspired the bosses are epic and require some amount of puzzle-solving to beat, they don't just have flashing weak points."
2,"Fun at first,but it tends to get boring quickly","you create things.That's about it.You also fight these little flying lizard-things that pour our of a hole in the ground until you build a building over it.This game will keep you entertained for about an hour,then it gets boring quickly.My advice is to rent the game before buying it."
4,"Good quality, nice taste, funky packaging","I've gotten several shipments of Klein nuts (almonds, mixed nuts) and think that the quality of the nuts and the price are great. The packaging (as others note), not so much. Sometimes the flimsy plastic seal on one of the tubs gives out before it arrives on my doorstep; since the lightweight top is no match for the physics of loose nuts, they end up scattered around the inside of the box. It's really not the end of the world - I just eat those first and save the other unbroken tubs for later. Good nuts at a good price."
2,"Good content, poor communication","I read this book because it was the official textbook for CFA Level 1 test. AIMR later dropped it and returned to White and Sondhi for the year 2000. Personally, I agree.This should be a fairly good financial analysis book, but because of its uncommunicative wording, it is not appealing indeed. Agree with a reader from England, it is dull.If the authors add their comments and pour some additional opinion and insights, this book will be much better.It appears that the book lost its good image (since 1973?) because most of its current readers have read the White & Sondhi's book. If they not read the White & Sondhi before they read this book, they might viewed this book much much better. In my opinion, the readers will get relatively the same knowledge from both books."
3,Doesn't meet the description,"I ordered this watch for my Mom and the watch has a jewlery clasp not a fold over clasp and as a result I returned the watch. Also, the one diamond was hard to see. For the money I think there are better watches out there."
1,A failed execution,"I wanted to be one of the few people to give this game a good review. Unfortunately, I would just be lying. Bebe's Kids could have been a great game if not for the many neucanses that plague it. I don't mind that the game is a Final Fight clone or that the resolution looks comparable to a Sega Master System game. What bug me are the slow animation, loopy-short music, and lack of variety. As anyone who's seen the movie may have guessed, the game takes place at Fun World, an amusement park with too many rules.I would tell you more, but I stopped playibng after only a few seconds."
5,Great looking watch at great price!,"This is a great looking watch at a great price. I would have paid the original retail price -- $225, I think -- but what a bargain at $69.99! Order it, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Nice for the price, sword will outlast the shield","Bought this for a spare - all my boys have great wooden swords, but never an extra for guests. The shield isn't great for horseplay, but looks great. The sword is good enough for looks and play. For the money, probably would order as a gift for anyone 7 and under or definitely for a costume/renaissance fair item."
3,One Good Cut Deserves Another ...but it doesn't happen.,"Delbert McClinton guests on a song he wrote with Jarvis, ""I'm Having A Real Bad Day"" and that alone is worth the price of admission since I don't think you can get the cut anywhere else.It's a toss-up whether this take on that wonderful ""music business road story"" is as good or better than Taj Mahal's cover, but why carp. Either of them is damn good.As for the rest of Jarvis's self-indulgence, plays great--who cares.I bought it for the one cut and found nothing else of interest. Mine is for sale on Amazon--someone please buy it."
2,Not for me,"I wanted a dress watch and ordered this one because of the diamond accents. When it arrived, I discovered it was much larger than I expected; about the same size as my casual watch. Also, it wasn't very substantial looking. I returned it."
5,Works Good,"Works fine. It may seem a bit cheap (plastic) but for home use its just fine. I would not buy one for profesional use, but for home use, this one is fine. I did my bathroom and the job came out fine. I plan on scraping off my popcorn ceilings through out the rest of my house and I will need to texture the ceilings after I am done and Im sure this spray gun will do the job great."
3,Texture gun,"A little too much plastic. It did the job (small one, two days). It just doesn't seem like it will have a long life. I had trouble with clogging.I spend more and get a more expensive hopper gun."
2,"Good, for a disposable sprayer","This throwaway texture gun worked well on the first room and began to jam up after the first cleaning. After the second use, the trigger adjustment jammed completely and I could not remove the hopper. On the third room, the gun sprayed intermittently (about 10% of normal) and leaked air. The construction of this gun is very, very cheap, but I have to give it two stars becaused it worked well, twice. The instructions also were good. Never purchase a used one of these. It's a disposable model."
3,An ok game,"This game is VERY difficult, not only because you get one life, and have to fight thousands of aliens, but each of the five levels you must go through takes an hour to three hours to complete. It is an intensely tedious game, but there are some nice animations. You play Lt. Ripley and must complete six tasks for each level to complete it. These tasks can be to save prisoners from the alien captures, fry some alien eggs, seal doors and fix piping or any other amount of tasks. There are only three weapons (flamethrower, machine gun and grenade launcher), so not much gameplay there. Bottom line is there are 10 types of aliens and 5000 of them each."
4,not perfect but still a good story ...,"An enjoyable story with a slow start but over all very satisfying climax. I loved that Arabella wasn't in the first flush of youth but a mature woman who saw the benefits of a marriage of 'convenience' which was exactly what Jack initially offered.She's stubborn and clever and makes a challenging and likable heroine. Something every good romance novel needs.I was not, however, so fond of Jack. He really didn't treat Arabella that well. He was always being broody and going on about how horrible it was for him without thinking of what he was putting Arabella through.This was ultimately redeemed in the epilogue where we finally see that he really does love Arabella.I finished this novel feeling warm and fuzzy- which is how you should feel. Although a little rough around the edges this is a good book. Perfect for staying inside on a rainy day."
1,very disappointing,"I have never written a review before but the awfulness of this book drove me to it. Reading about the relationship between Jack and Arabella reminded me of watching a fish helplessly flounder at the end of a line until it dies. The heroine is manipulated and controlled, never has any real power or personality, yet at the end the hero is felled by love for her. The book again pointed out to me the problem in this genre--formula, formula, formula. Where are the books that are entertaining and yet representative of the really great relationships that do exist in this world? Where are the interesting female characters who actually have a brain and might not want to fall in love with a weird control freak, no matter if he is a duke with an interesting white streak in his hair? Get the book out of the library if you want to give it a shot. Don't spend the $6.99."
2,Broken after one month of use,"Last summer we bought two of these cruisers and both of them broke after only one month of normal use. The water squirt function quit working after only a week. My kids LOVED them, but for the price these cruisers are, they need to be built to last."
1,Not like the commercial,"This looks great on tv, but does not go fast at all. It was easy to put together, but in the pool we could not tell if the wind was pushing us or the motor. It was also hard to steer, we went in lots of circles. We returned it the same day we bought it! Save your money for something else!"
4,The kids love it!,"It's been a definite hit in my pool this summer. The wave runner glides smoothly over the water, but at a slow, steady speed. The kids love the idea of driving on the water, but it's sometimes hard to steer in a certain direction.The kids don't seem to mind that too much. Kids should be encouraged to get on the waverunner from the stairs of the pool. My nephew gave us quite a scare when he tried getting on from the side of the pool and the waverunner tilted over. He barely missed hitting his head on the side of the pool, so as with any floation device, use some vigilance."
4,"get it, its cheap!","We purchase one for our 6 year old daughter. She was brought up on real boats and jetski's. We were undecided how we felt about this, but she saw the commercial and wanted it. I think its the best thing ever. Yes it goes slow, but what do you expect for 39.99 you can't buy anything motorized for that. We live on the lake and she has no problems at all so don't let the ""POOL USE ONLY"" scare you. To her its the best thing ever. I could have boughten a []$ air matress and I'm sure it wouldn't last any longer than this. Its a cheap thrill for a kid!"
3,Different than at the department store,"I sample tried this same perfume at the department store in the mall, and I loved it. But when I went to buy this online, the scent is not quite the same. I'm not sure why... maybe the seller had an old supply and therefore the scent faded? I'm not sure, but definitely noticed a significant different in the scent. Much weaker and also not the exact same scent. I'm not super happy about it, since it was over 40 bucks."
5,so nice,i the wife got this as a gift for xmas i love the scent always have it wonderful floral scent i love wearing this just to step out or for a night out on the town
1,Gone bad or knock-off?,"It looks like Happy, packaged like Happy....but it's not Happy. After using Happy for over 15 years you can tell the difference. It didn't smell as if it had gone bad, but it certainly was not Happy in the bottle. Amazon was quick to issue a full refund."
2,"Not too ""Happy"" about this product","The product I received seemed like it might be old product or expired. The scent didn't stay with me, as compared to other samples I've had of ""Happy"" in the past; in fact, it couldn't be smelled at all after half an hour. I contacted the seller about it who said he would return it for a full refund including the cost of my postage. Hopefully, he will be true to his word."
1,The bottle I received is stale,I have just opened the Clinique Happy 1.07oz perfume. This one is stale and rancid. I have been wearing Happy for many years and I currently own a 3.4oz bottle. I only needed the 1.07oz because I am flying over to UK and can only take a small bottle on the aircraft. I am very disappointed and would like to be compensated in some way as I am not sure if amazon take perfume returns.
5,My favorite perfume!,"Clinique Happy is my absolute favorite perfume!! I love the slight citrus scent instead of the ""old people"" flowery or powder scents. I am so glad I ordered it online because it's twice as much at department stores. The lady at the department store I went to said not to trust Amazon because they get the ""damaged"" items and the scent isn't right, but I've never had a problem, and the perfume smells the same. I even took mine to the store to compare, and couldn't tell the difference.The 1.7oz size lasts me several years because I don't wear it every day, and I don't only use one small spritz at a time."
2,Is this supposed to be so mild you cannot smell it?,I took a chance. I purchased this from Amazon. I opened it up and sprayed it. I smell a faint hint of something. A half hour later there is no smell. So................... this leads me to believe that this produce is a fraud and has been tampered with. I don't think I am assuming anything. I cannot smell anything !
2,Missing something,"While I like sweet fragrances, this one is too simple and smells like it would be for children. No depth, no intrigue.It isn't interesting or compelling, but even so, too loud.Someone wears it at work and I always wonder why, but then again, I don't like her clothes either."
4,Yeah! I am happy,Happy that I bought this fragrance. Wearing it seems to make u feel happy. I know that sounds corny but it does!
1,POOR CHOICE,"I am NOT HAPPY with this product. I like HAPPY but this product leaves has no fragrance after wearing for only a short period! I have ordered my last fragrance from Amazon due to the fact I did not realize it was non-refundable. No safety net there! You can return fragrances to other sites! Oh, it is considered hazardous! So, it's okay for Amazon to ship a hazardous item to me, but I can't return it to them. What's up with that, Amazon? I think this item is non-refundable because it is not the genuine product.Thanks for hard earned $'s down the drain! Lesson learned!"
1,Clinique Happy,This bottle of Clinique Happy smelled like alcohol. Clinque is the only fragrance I wear and this smells nothing like it. Highly disappointed.
1,Buyer beware,"I would recommend to try a different hammock than this one. I made sure that I took my time and didn't put any unnecessary strain on the support cords. I set mine up and it was comfortable and very relaxing. I enjoyed it for about an hour. I got up and after I got settled back onto it, the support cords became separated from the nylon fabric. It happened so fast that I didn't have time to brace myself. I weigh well within the limits as recommend on the package. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,works good so far...,"I just recieved this product today and tested it out on existing hammock hooks in my house. When i first sat on it it seemed to give a little(which it shouldnt because I only weigh 120 pounds), but that could have been the knot i tied, because it seemed fine after that and I was confident that I could sit in it without it ripping and me falling onto the floor. I would not recommend buying this hammock if you wheigh over 200 pounds."
5,Title says it all,"If you liked SICK PUPPY and SKINNY DIP, you'll love this one. As with all of Hiassen's works, odd characters are the norm. The plots are also waaaay out there. But this is the fascination with the author, for he can handle his materials and make us laugh one minute and cry the next. Carl Hiassen lures you into this tale of bass tournaments, corruption and murder with the skill of a champion angler. There's something to hook you on every page: Convincing protagonists, hilarious supporting characters, local color, and an engrossing story of murder and environmental destruction. The characters are even more believably outrageous in DOUBLE WHAMMY than there were/are in his other great reads. Just when you think the book cannot get any more outrageous, Hiassen blows you out of the water. You would be hard pressed to find a writer as amuzing as him. If you like Hiassen's work, you must read THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD--another great southern-based storyteller that packs a punch."
4,Love it ..... then there's the babes,"I love Hiaasen's storyline's and Male quirky characters. However I tire of the ""gorgeous, sexy"" female stereotypes. The men seemed so well drawn, I found it a pity the same colorfulness wasn't afforded the girls."
5,"Hate fishing, loved book...","Since childhood I have always hated fishing -- the most boring pastime imaginable, and if you succeed -- YUCCH! But this book I loved. Not many can pull off this kind of demented, passionate, hilarious thriller. From this book on, Hiaasen joins Westlake, Hoyt and Perry as a virtuoso of the comic thriller"
2,Not for me,"I was referred to this book by the Amazon ""other people who buy what you buy bought this"" link. The book was ok, but didn't have that cannot-put-it-down aspect to it."
3,Mindblowingly average,"This book offers little to distinguish itself. Its humor is rarely funny beyond a mere chuckle, its quirckiness seems contrived, its main character, Decker, is without flair. The plot is interesting, but is worne out by the end of the novel. What distinguishes this novel at first glance fades away half-way through, and you're left with a startlingly average mystery."
3,Disappointed!,"I've read 5 Carl Hiaasen books over the past years and loved every one of them! The quirky characters, the insane plots, and the excellent narrative that puts you right in the middle of the Florida swamps with these screwballs as they lie, cheat and steal their way to their retribution. But Double Whammy just didn't do it for me. It got to be boring what with all the dead leads and not one character measuring up to the usual comedic pratfalls of the previous books. I finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through it, read the last few chapters, and moved on to James Patterson.I'll think twice about another Carl Hiaasen book in the future."
2,Read other Hiaasen books instead,"Professional bass fishing is ripe for satire, and based on ""Strip Tease"", I thought Hiaasen would be just the man for the job. Instead, he's served up an undercooked stew filled with offhand references to gruesome death. By aiming at fanatical fishermen and sleazy TV evangelists, Hiaasen misses both. Reading this is like playing a game of ""Marco Polo"" in a very big pool: laughs are there, but just out of reach, and what sounds promising usually gets you a noseful of chlorinated water. If you like character more than caricature, skip this book"
2,overrated,"Amusing, but unrealistic if you know anything at all about bass tournaments. Seeking the one biggest fish? Using stringers? Come on. I reckon if I knew less I would have liked it more."
5,A fun comedy/thriller with memorable characters,Double Whammy is an action packed comedy/thriller with memorable characters..plenty of.low-lifes and villains who are trying to make it big in bass fishing. Hiassen is reminiscient of Elmore Leonard except he adds more humor. It's a very enjoyable read.
4,Carl makes me happy,Carl Hiassen's books always make me laugh out loud. I love all of his books and highly recommend them all.
3,Not bad but far too many odd typos!,"I'm talking about sentences like ""I'm dunking of getting into modeling."" There are many where the words aren't right or are spacedtogether. It looks like automatic replace gone wild, and that's a shame. Author: spring for the copy edit or proofread. It is needed!"
3,Angry Eighties Carl Hiaasen is the best!,"Angry Eighties Carl Hiaasen is the best!I moved to Florida in the late eighties, so reading these books is like a trip down memory lane. The thing is, I was too young to note all that was happening around me that Hiaasen references - so the book also serves as a fictionally based history lesson.Also, I don't fish - but anyone in Florida knows that you don't speak ill of the sport. Not just an industry, fishing is the De facto past time for a large number of my neighbors who live on or near the beach. It's serious business... and Hiaasen's parody of it in Double Whammy hits the culture dead on.Bad evangelists, corrupt condominium plans, sugar barons and (of course!) Skink. This book is a great time killer for fans for Florida and Carl Hiassen's writing."
3,"Fear factory, anyone?","I'm a bargain hunter over here, and I got this CD for like 3 bucks. So, I popped it in and for, let's see... the entire album, I thought I had accadently put in a fear factory CD. Nothing is really different, except lost souls didn't pull off the whole fear factory thing the right way. They're just a wannabe band, and thats all they'll ever be."
5,Beautiful book,"My 12 yr old grand daughter couldn't resist reading it the moment it arrived, and was very impressed by the story, the illustrations and of course, the inspiring message. I haven't read it yet. I'm waiting until after Thanksgiving!"
1,Peanut explosion!,"Three of the six containers burst open during shipping, spreading peanuts all over the place. I would never order any Klein's products again since they all appear to be packed in the same flimsly containers."
2,delicious peanuts in ridiculously weak packaging,"Agree with other reviewers, the peanuts are fresh, large, taste good, but how can they be sent in such flimsy packaging? The foil on the top was broken on 5 out of 6 boxes, and 3 of them had a break on the side. This packaging is a joke."
4,Use in recipes,"Wrapped well enough that those which spilled out of a container were still protected. I ate those first. I go toward vegetarian meals, so adding them to buckwheat pasta or when I make kung pao with rice, helps me enjoy the meals better. I've stored these peanuts for winter emergency use when snow may keep me from going to a store."
2,Mostly OK,"Decent print quality, but it will go through cartridges fairly quick on higher settings. Be certain you have a line on low cost replacements, as the list price on those suckers will rapidly add up to more than the value of the machine.My biggest objection is the bundled software. If there's a more convoluted pile of bloatware masquerading as a printer driver, I don't know what it is. My machine suffered about a minute off its boot time while the OfficeJet manager software went about its thing. If your the adventurous type, be prepared to go into your MSCONFIG to neuter the offending app...at the price of a longer wait any time you wish to print.Overall, it's a good machine and has served me well. I just wish it could stick to its job and leave the rest of my system alone."
1,Is this a joke???,"You can draw any of this names out of a hat and make an argument as to who should be number 1. (take your pick)Magic, Bird, Jordan, Kareem, Russell, Wilt, Oscar. Anyone that even considers shaq as a top ten or even top twenty doesn't know NBA basketball. All this writer saw was that every other book out there had Jordan at number 1 and he felt he needed to grabs someones attention by doing something different. Stats dont say a thing about any of the players I just mentioned, this guys were extra special because they had character, they were winners, they signified what was good about the league. I take the Admiral or Dream in their prime over Shaq anyday. Dont believe the hype, shaq is one of the best ever, but never make the mistake of putting him at number 1. This book should be banned."
2,He's wrong,"Decent read...except he's wrong. How he could list Shaq as the #1 player of all time is beyond comprehension. I could understand the argument for Chamberlain, but MJ's teams were far more dominant, due to his airness exclusively. But his forecast includes Shaq winning at least 3 more titles. One gets the feeling he ranked the players like this to create controversey...but that doesn't make him right."
1,poor analysis,This author's opinion is worthless. here is my all time list:1- Magic2- Bird3- Jordan4- Chamberlain5- Oscar RobertsonAny list without Magic and Bird at 1&2 has no value. Scouts and GM's agree almost universally on this.This guy wrote a book and should have instead posted it on a website!
5,Mikel's Faith,Man I see you keep getting better! You are Dope homie! Keep doing your Thing and I will keep supporting!Mikel's Faith
4,Well done!,"Great characters, lovely acting :) The pace of the story made me really want it to continue when it ended. Great material for a feature length film!"
3,Important but Fluffy,"I thought this was a great book and actually has an important message. We no longer need to be defined by our relationship history, current status or future plans. I think we are living in extraordinary times where a significant portion of the population are starting to make choices like this and that the trend will grow in direct proportion to our increased freedom and flexibility around relationships. However, the book is way too cute and fluffy and probably in the next few years Ms Cagen will be putting out some more weightier books. The other thing was that half the ""quirky alone"" bios were of people in their 20's and frankly unless you've had the hairy experience of singledom in your 30's you don't know anything."
5,Together in our aloneness,"A funny, insightful and right-on look at how being single & alone is better than together & lonely; a nice reminder that loving thyself is a prerequisite for the possibility of loving others."
2,"Good ideas, messy format","This book introduces the worst word into the English language. ""Quirkyalone"" doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it? Also, the pages were cluttered with quotes, profiles, and pictures in the large margins. Some were tilted sideways. The text is super small, so good luck with that. If Sasha Cagen had just decided to write a concise book about the travails of singlehood, it would have turned out so much better. She presents interesting ideas and characters/situations any single person can identify with. Distractions aside, the ideas in the book were a decent read. Otherwise, I ended up with a headache."
2,just TOO much...,"I've never been a person who has to have a significant other or who longs to be in a relationship. In fact, I took the QuirkyAlone quiz and scored VERY high. However, this book is just too much. I love people who are creative and artistic but not all of them are like the people in this book. Women and men can be distinct individuals in or out of a relationship without going to the extremes that this book takes them. It is just too much."
3,Too much hype.,"A good friend recommended this book as a ""fun and funny"" read with some interesting points. Honestly, I find it hard to believe that the original article it started out as attracted the attention of a publishing house. Yes there were some funny points (See ""Quirky together"") but it was distracting to read and a little light on content. I'm not even convinced some of my Quirkyalone friends wouldn't be offended by it."
1,a thin trend.,"I don't think the author's insights are anything new, and she's spun out an entire book from a thin premise. Another point: people who think they are ""quirky,"" or refer to themselves as ""quirky,"" are by definition not at all quirky. It's very self-conscious and congratulatory. One cannot have a whole movement of quirky (i.e., individual) people -- a contradiction in terms."
2,Didn't really work,Bought this with the hopes of cutting down on the barking of our maltese. Set it up as directed and it has not worked at all. I don't know if it depends on the breed or the dog but it definitely does not work for us.
1,DID NOT WORK,"i have three dogs (pug, pomperanian, shepoo) who bark for anything and bought this with the hopes it would stop this barking and it DIDNT! they are barkers and that's that have tried everything if anyone has any recommendations please enlighten me."
2,Bark Free not so great,The Bark Free Dog Training Device did not work so well. When it was set to the annoying sound humans can hear the neighbors could also hear it. This worked a bit but I didn't want to offend my neighbors with the sound. When the device was on the ultrasound that only dogs could hear it did nothing. 2 beagles were not stopped in their tracks by this device.
2,Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,"My wife and I are both hard of hearing making it impossible for us to do the aural testing. We believe the device may have been working for a few weeks when used in our bedroom where my wife watches TV with our Bichon, Rosie, in her lap. Rosie often jumped up and bark loudly once or twice when hearing a strange noice at night and did it less for this short period.I didn't have the kind of experience with the device such that I would consider recommending it. The barking was, and still is, very irritating."
1,I wish it had!,"Unfortunately, it didn't work for us. We have a barking dachsund and he doesn't stop. This item didn't change that. It had a little affect, for a few minutes, when I set it on the setting that humans can hear. But on the other setting he wasn't even phased. Shortly into it, neither setting worked. I sold it in our garage sale a week later."
1,No Effect,"Dogs ignore ultrasound and audible settings. Citronella collars work much better, but my dogs are really too small to be able to wear the products on the market. Manufacturers - a smaller Citronella spray collar for small dogs??"
4,Works great,"We got our mini schnauzer and she was always good around us. But when we'd leave she would go into barking fits. With this product she still bards once or twice, but she hasn't had a single fit. I believe this product helped train her to use more appropriate behavior."
1,Good Idea but Flawed,Any loud sound or wind gust will set this off. Also the range was too short for what we needed. We originally mounted it to our decks support post until we found out that the sound transfer through the deck would set this uint off. Returned for a refund and got the SportDog No Bark ReChargeable Collars which I fully recommend and would buy again.
2,This product does not work,So far this product has had zero effect. We have tried all the various settings and the dogs still bark.
1,Waste of money,"I have three shelties and it didn't deter their barking at all. It goes off when my husband coughs but as for the dogs, did absolutely nothing."
1,WOW my dog just looked at it!,"I saw this product and thought ""what a great idea!"" Well my expectations were WAY to high! When I finally got it in the mail I tried it out right away and realized it sucked! My dog would bark when I left the house so I turned it on and ""left"" the house. The bark off's beep was more annoying and louder than my dog's barking. I went back in and pushed the test button and my dog wasn't effected by the beep at all! She just looked at the thing!If you expect to get a product that will stop your dog from barking, I wouldn't get this! It was a waste of time."
1,Useless!,"It didn't work AT ALL with the puppy that was unfortunately thrust upon me. I'll give it to him; he's persistent. Earplugs were the only thing that allowed me to ignore his incessant whining for the sake of whining during his crate training.It was a complete waste of money, but worth a shot I guess.Invest in some good earplugs instead, if you're crate training."
2,My chihuahua must be immune,"On the ultrasonic setting he's pretty much unfazed by it. On the audible setting he definitely hears it but so does the whole house even behind closed doors. Maybe some dogs react more to the ultrasonic mode than ours, but for us the product isn't really helping."
2,Has very limited use,"I have a neighbor with barking dogs. My dog doesn't bark, but when they bark, he will eventually join in. I placed this 2 feet from our neighbor's fence, and I installed it 7-8 ft up, so that it could peer over the fence at the neighbor's dogs. The neighbor's dogs, as loud as they are, do not trigger the device. My dog, when he barks, triggers the device, 1 out of every 3-4 times. When he did trigger it, there was an immediate change in his demeanor... I don't think he liked it. But because it was so infrequent, no dog learns anything. I imagine, that if my dog was the barker, and I installed it at around my dog's height, he would trigger it and stop barking."
2,Kinda Sorta works,"There are 2 barkers next door. They even bark at squirrels. This product works a tad, but I'm fixing to return it. It doesn't seem to completely quiet those Jack Russell dogs. It did not promise to do so. No promises, no guarantees. So be it."
1,Didn't activate when my dog barked...,"I've seen a decent number of reviews complaining that this product didn't seem to work for their small dog. Add me to the list, because this didn't activate at all when my Pug barked, so it was utterly useless. Sent it back and successfully used a static bark collar activated by vibrations."
1,Just Didn't Work,"We have a Weimaraner and she barks at real and imagined persons/events. She's a Weim, after all.Mounted this, tested it, followed all directions, and confirmed correct operation. We've now used it for about three weeks.Absolutely no change in behavior. It had no effect that I could see whatsoever.It would get zero stars if the system allowed that."
2,Hurts my ears more than dog!!,"Purchased this to help keep my mini wiener dog quiet when outside. What a waste of money! On high frequecny it doesn't faze him, on low frequecy it hurts my ears more than it does his but does seem to quiet him down a bit. Guess he's just gonna bark at the wind after all. Even tried a collar and he learned to move electrodes to the side. Save your dollars."
4,Worked for us,"I purchased the Bark Free despite mixed user reviews for our 1 1/2 year old, 90lb, separation-anxiety-ridden mastiff. She is not ""a barker"", but was whining and/or barking in her crate whenever we would leave the house. She responds well to verbal corrections normally, so we thought we'd give it a try. IT WORKED! We kept the Bark Free on the audible setting so we could be sure that it was going off, set up a video camera and headed out. After the first bark, the Bark Free went off and she gave it a look like, ""WTF?"" and stopped barking. That pretty much did it. She still gets anxious, but at least there's no more barking and whining. :)"
1,Didn't work on neighbors dog,"Even though there are four of the little barking house shoes, and they go insane when the owners leave or come home, it never set this thing off. Tried all the different ways to set it up. Never got anything out of it.I think you must have to aim it right at the dog. Over the fence doesn't work."
4,Worked but not perfect,"I have a puppy maltipoo and as soon as we left the room he would whine, howel, and bark which is not to good for apartment living. We got this to train him to stop. He stoped barking imediatly. We only turn it on when we are not home though cause everyday sounds can set it off (such as closing the microwave, door etc). I recomend testing it out on audible first so you know what types of sounds can set it off, then switch to ultrasonic."
4,Good Indoor Bark Alarm for the Price,"Your dog(s) need to be fairly close to this receiver in order for it to be activated. I put it by the front door which is where most of my problems occur. They still bark once or twice but once they hear the ultrasonic sound, they stop. If they are in another part of the house, then it doesn't do any good. Overall, a good bang for the buck."
1,Doesnt Work,"This product may work for a very tentetive barking dog, but the hardcore barkers that most of us are looking to silence wont even hesitate when you turn it on. Too bad."
2,It was immune to my dogs barking,"My chihuahua mix didn't set it off. We tried all levels, including sensitive, and even in audible nothing happened when he barked. It went off when the other dog who does not have a barking problem barked and scared him to death. On to a shock collar!"
1,Does Not help control barking for smaller dogs,Total waste of money!! We have had plugged in foe 3 weeks now. There has been no change in our 3 small dogs. This has not changed any of their barking habbits. I would not reccomend this for small breed dogs.
2,Bark Free - not really,"It doesn't work for me and I should have reviewed the specs first. The noise coming out of this little box is 80db. Here some common noises that are about 80db:Garbage disposal, dishwasher, average factory, freight train. Car wash at 20 ft (89 dB); propeller plane flyover at 1000 ft (88 dB); diesel truck 40 mph at 50 ft (84 dB); diesel train at 45 mph at 100 ft (83 dB). Food blender (88 dB); milling machine (85 dB); garbage disposal (80 dB).So if your dog is a stubborn species don't buy it."
4,Bark Free Definitely Helped Me,"Our neighbor (although we really like them) bought a yap yap dog next to our rental home in Hawaii. We placed it in the window facing the dogs yard. The dog which barked in a high pitched yelp every morning and evening like crazy has essentially stopped barking except for the occassional bark. I am amazed. It does not seem to affect the older yellow lab who sometimes barks at people walking. I did have to run it on audible to originally see results. I ran it on ultra sonic only the first 2 days and it did nothing, then I ran it on audible for 2 days and instantly saw results. Although the owner did not seem to like it and hunted all around to see if they could figure out what it was. We did not want to complain but we could not stand the incessant barking at 6 am and 9 pm and this seemed like an ok and painfree solution. Am so glad it worked for us. I must say that in Hawaii, our homes are very close together so maybe that helped in making the product work."
1,I'm still figuring out what problem is with this thing.,"Doesn't work. Goes off when the wind blows, doesn't go off when the dog barks - Go figure"
1,Practical uses for this hunk of plastic,"1. Generate an annoying high pitch noise to accompany the constant barking of your neighbor's dog2. A streamlined, lightweight, paperweight3. Skeet shotor4. An intriguing conversation pieceCause it sure does not deter dogs from barking"
3,Works sometimes,"When I first put it up, it worked great. Now after 2 weeks,still set on high-sensitivity, it does not seem to be as sensitive as previously. I can purposly cause it to go off, (so it is still working) but the dogs barking only sometimes sets it off.Not sure why. Maybe time will tell.My friend who recommended this to me told me her dog learned to bark in a deeper register so as not to set it off. Our wicked-smart dogs have learned how to outsmart the Bark Free, it seems (Cairn terriers)Has this happened to anyone else?The 50' cord is a very nice feature.1 1/2 yrs later, editing my review - after being in the sun for all this time it does not work at all."
3,Minor and transient effect,The product had some effect on barking puppy Lab. Even when at close proximity (2 feet) it has little effect after a few days.I have used ultrasonic training devices to good effect with adults to cause an orienting response and thereby regain attention during formal training sessions. It seemed possible that this type of stimulation would work for barking. Alas it did not.
1,failed first day,Tested fine out of the box. Put it outside under an awning and it was dead the next morning. The dog next door never heard it so I do not know if it would have worked?
1,Buy Citronella Collar Instead,"I have two yappy pomeranian dogs. The larger one periodically wears the Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar (available from Amazon for approx $45). It works wonderfully but it's only recommended for dogs over 6 lbs. So I bought the Lentek to control barking in the smaller dog.I've had it for two months now and still use it, but it only works minimally. The dogs sometimes pause a bit when it's triggered, but most of the time they just continue barking.I guess the Lentek's better than nothing, but I wouldn't buy it again. Instead, if your dog is over 6 lbs, I would buy the citronella collar."
1,Gimmick?,It's obvious when this device is activated but unfortunately there has been no noticeable change in the obnoxious barking dogs behavior.It is mounted around 10' from the dog been but again no change in the frequency of their barks.Perhaps they just tune it out... Or maybe it isn't loud enough even at fullblast...
1,"Does not ""train"" only works as a training aid.","I purchased this device over a year ago, to deter neighbor dogs barking. Unfortunately, they want their dogs to bark every time I, or my quests, use my driveway. Because the dog owners encourage barking, the dogs bark even more aggressively when the devise activates. This item may work as a training aid, for dog owners who are serious about training their own dog. Otherwise, it does not appear to deter barking without reinforcement and cooperation from the dog's owner.It is a great concept, that I would try again upon an improved product with proven results."
1,Does not work,I could only get the unit to work by dropping it or hitting it. It would not go off less then a foot from the barking dog.
1,Didn't work,"This didn't work at all and I just finally got around to throwing it out. I'm not sure if it depends on the dog, but I have two and it didn't affect either one at all."
2,"So far, not good","I set this up by our garage to deal with our neighbor's barking dog and it would not go off. The range tot he barking dog was about 35 ft. I then moved it to the side of our house, which was about 30 ft and it still would not go off. The instructions say 25 ft, but that means I am almost going to have to set it up on the fence. I am not impressed at all with the range. I would not get this again and am debating returning it now."
1,Very Unhappy Customer,I bought 2 of these products to control dod barking. They worked very well BUT for only 10 days and then neither of them worked any more! Very unhappy!
2,Works sometimes,"I put this one on my fence facing the dogs and they didn't seem to pay attention to it until I put it in 'audible' mode. That seemed to get their attention and they stopped for a while. But it still didn't stop the barking just changed the pattern. Bark, Beep, stop for a few minutes. Bark, Beep, stop for a few minutes. The good thing is that the bad neighbor also heard the beep and finally started to take the dogs inside at night. So I guess one way or another it fulfilled the intended purpose."
2,Didn't work for us,"Unfortunately, the Bark Free Device had no effect on our West Highland White Terrier. Tried all the settings to no avail. She also has a shock collar which she barks right through, so maybe it is just that she is immune to these types of things."
2,Ineffective,The Bark Free comes with a cheap vinyl cover if you intend to use it outside. I spent the better part of a day building a nice weatherproof box for it. I should have tested the Bark Free with the vinyl cover first because it had no effect on my Sheltie.
3,Dog got used to it.,"Worked great for about a week in the ultrasonic mode, but the dog got used to it (weaton terrier). now, it has only marginal use when in the audible version, which annoys everyone."
5,Works Great,"I live in a townhouse and have a deck that the dogs (2) access through a dog door. They go out on the deck to bathroom, but recently I found out (through calls from a neighbor) that they were barking when I was gone. Put this out on the deck and no more barking, instantly. The only bad thing is if it does go off one of the dogs won't go out on the deck for several hours. I unplug it when I'm home so it doesn't go off more than necessary as it will go off during thunder storms. It will only work in very small quarters (within 25 feet), so if you have a big area that you are trying to cover you may need to find something with more range. I've only used it on the audible setting so I can here it too and the high sensitivity setting will set it off too much. The low setting is good enough. Plug in only, which is fine for me."
