5,Superb contemporary production of the WW II Stalingrad seige,"Wow! Realism beyond compare in a great new war film about the WW II German invasion of Stalingrad. Two snipers pair off against one another -- high suspense and an incredible story.There is also the expected love story sub-plot but not to the degree that the horror of this insurrection is in any way diminished.The cinematography is astounding and the scenes are quite graphic. This is one to see, no doubt about it!"
5,High School History Teacher,"My son teaches high school history, so when this movie made it to his Christmas list how could I pass it up?? Very affordable price as well......."
5,The horror of war,Superb acting from Law and Harris! The use of snipers by the Russians is very consistent with the book Stalingrad. Enemy at the Gate captures the horror of the war
2,disappointing,"The Amazon review got it right - this is essentially a cat and mouse thriller set within an epic battle. Beyond that, we're stuck with an unconvincing love story and even more strange, a cast of actors with English accents who are all supposed to be Russians! At the same time, Ed Harris is the German sniper with an American accent trying to hunt down Jude Law. These annoyances might have been overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that there is little to hold your interest beyond some compelling cinematography."
2,You get what you pay for,"I got this bag because it looked nice and sounded good online. It is a nice looking bag, but when I started using it I immediately noticed that some of the edges began to fray. The stitching also seems to be coming apart. It looks nice enough from a distance, but for heavy usage you might want to bite the bullet and pay a little more."
1,defect in the strap hook,"I confirm all the other reviews that the strap does disengage from the hook unexpectedly,mMcKleinUSA Harrison 83385 V Series 17-Inch Partners Full Grain Oil Tanned Leather Laptop Brief (Black)y husband dropped his laptop twice, when try to carry the case."
3,Most of everything I expected,"Everything about the bag is what I expected accept the fact that the top does not stay open. Usually this type of bag has hinges that over center so that it will stay open for easy access. Not in this case. Had I could have put my hands on it before the purchase, I would have backed out"
2,Disappointed,"I was very happy with everything about this briefcase until after only a couple of months of use it began to wear -- not the way a high-quality leather item wears, but the way a cheap leather item does. Oh, it's real leather on top, but that's only skin deep. All along the vertical welts along the edges, which of course is where the action is, the thin layer of leather has rapidly worn off. Underneath is not unfinished raw leather, but some kind of black mush like you see when a cheap pair of ""leather"" shoes begins to wear away.This started to become obvious only a couple of weeks after the deadline for a full refund passed. What a disappointment for a bag that otherwise seemed like a great value.UDPATE: The clips that hold on the shoulder strap have become pretty undependable too -- more disappointment."
2,Not for those that already have the factory manuals.,"If your restoring your own camaro, (and you do your own restoration work) you'd think this would be a good book to get. However, if your like me, you already own the GM overhaul/chasis manual, the fisher body manual, the wiring diagram and the factory assembly manual. I bought this book thinking it would aid me in restoring my camaro. Instead, this book is nothing but a bunch of diagrams/clips taken from the books mentioned above but in much less detail.I am surprised the other two reviews were real positive because if you already have the factory manuals, it renders this book useless and quite lacking. This book does have a good bit of facts and codes but if your looking for that type of info, go for the Big Book of Camaro Data.For real ""how to"" type applications and in a step-by-step procedure in bringing your camaro back to life I recommend the Camaro Restoration Handbook by Currao and the Camaro Owner's Handbook by Sessions. Check 'em out."
2,Not so much... Help that is,Lots of Poor/small copy's of the assembly manuals diagrams.At the minimum they should have blown the diagrams up to make them full page pictures.
3,OK,I bought one with a damaged box so I only paid about $16.00 including the shipping. It was probably worth about that. I can't imagine this listing for as much as they said. Very thin and I had to bend a couple of forks to get them straight.___Less than 3 weeks later the flatware is starting to rust. I wish I could change my rating to one star. Stay away from this.
2,too flat,"The flatware set was very thin and too easily bent. It will do for awhile, but I would not have bought the set if I had felt how thin they were."
1,Cheap quality. Unusable.,"Even though the price is so cheap for this item, I'm not sure why Amazon carries such a low quality item. I paid like $10 for this item and it's a complete waste of money."
1,Stay Away,"I agree with the rest of the reviewers, this is a very low quality, cheap feeling and looking product. I couldn't imagine anyone ever paying the listed price. I paid $15 w/ free shipping and I still feel I over paid. Marginally better than plastic utensils. Read the other reviews and stay away."
1,Do Not Buy This !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I received this set as a gift, the person who bought it only paid 16$ which is 15 more than it should have been. This was so thin it felt like tinfoil, and I would never use them. I gave them away. This is the worst silverware I have ever seen. Plastic would be a better buy. I gave it one star only because Amazon won't let you give it a zero, but that is what it deserves. The manufacturer should be ashamed.If I had paid for this myself, they would have gotten a call from one angry customer."
1,AWFUL,ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY NO WAY IT COULDVE BEEN $100.00 THE $24.99 PRICE IS STILL NO BARGAIN MAYBE AT $4.99 ITS TO THIN AND COULD BEND WHILE USING IT DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY THE ITEM IS TOTALY WORTHLESS THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF PUTING THEIR NAME ON IT DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Decent for the price!,We purchased these cause our old ones were rusting. I had these a month and one fork has a small rust spot on them. Other then that they are good quality. I love the weight and the simple look of them. They go with just about anything.
3,Adequate,"I was looking for an inexpensive replacement for my aging cracking plastic handled daily-use flatware. This is an adequate replacement. Definitely not as high a quality product as I would think Farberware should be, but for the price, it serves its purpose. Picture looked much better than actual product. I am shocked the ""retail price"" is listed at around $80!! NO WAY!Good starter set, however."
1,cheap garbage,"I bought it 6 weeks ago. It started RUSTING! No, I'm not kidding, I had to throw it away!"
1,wanted to give 0 star,"It might be worth $5-10, the list price of $100 is just to attract people who are looking for sale. If amazon list this as $10 item selling for $100 than i would have give 4 stars.."
3,Meb,The book assumes that you are familiar with the Treo's instruction manual. This is not very satisfactory as the accompanying manual is not well written and hence forcing one to look elsewhere for a better book.This book does show the very many things that the Treo is capable of and is certainly worth the value.
4,"Yes, but....","This version did include mountain folk ""cleaned up"" and I agree that the original mountain characters, some of which returned here, seemed more realistic than those added for this particular adaptation; however, keep in mind that in the book and TV series Christy teaches the children and some of the women about hygiene and keeping things clean, so she influences them in this way. One of the ways she makes a difference in Cutter Gap."
1,Christy,"I was very excited about these movies come out on TV a few years back, only to be severely disappointed. I did not care for Lauren Lee Smith as Christy, or Diane Ladd as Miss Alice. Smith was whiny and annoying, lacking the conviction Kellie Martin had. And Ladd, whose work I normally love, was very sloppy, slipping contractions into the otherwise refined Quaker way of speaking. Tyne Daly did so much better. Watch the movies once just to find out who Christy chooses if you're dying to know, but beyond that, don't waste your time."
3,A different Production of Christy. But a nice One,"This movie is not like the TV series that we all know and come to love.It is in my view stand alone movies not relating to the TV series at all.If you approach the movie not comparing it to the TV series, you might actually enjoy this movie and the other two that follow.This might not be a 5 star production but in my view it is a wholesome production with reference to God and the Bible."
2,It's ok...,"This movie is ok... only its not the same as the TV show. There really is no chemistry between the actors. They also take a real step back in the Christy character. During the TV show, she had a real comraderie with the mountain people, in this movie, its like she just got there and they don't trust her anymore. As I said, its ok... just don't expect it to be like the television show."
2,DIsappionting,"I was rather disappionted with this addition to the Christy series. Not only were hardly any of the original actors in the movie, but the story went over ground already covered in the original series. I found it redundent and annoying. The girl who played Christy tried her best but I don't know how you can top the original. Plus in the end it does not let on to who (the doc or the minister) Christy ends up with. Read the book for the full story, it is definetly worth it!"
3,A new Christy video for your family,"This movie is a continuation of the Christy series that was on television several years ago. It is based on the wonderful novel, ""Christy,"" by Catherine Marshall. In this new movie, young Christy travels to a poverty striken mountain village to become the new schoolteacher. In the tv series, the children looked truly poor and, in some cases, dirty. In this movie, everyone is cleaned up. The children are perfect little models and the cove residents are well dressed, with lots of make-up. You and your family might still enjoy this movie if you are die-hard Christy fans. Everyone else should invest in the original Christy videos, some of which are available on amazon.com."
1,disappointed fan,"I came into this movie with lots of expectations and sweet memory from the original tv series but only found myself shocked and heart broken.The previous viewer was right about the problem of charactors inconsistency which was the main reason that destroyed everything good left from the original series. In my heart, Kellie Martin is always the Christy I remembered in the smoky mountain who was willing to fight for her children and Rand was the pastor who shared God's love in whatever he said or did.All of the above was missing in the movies and to my worst nightmare, what the charactors portrayed was just the opposite!!! The only actor I like is Dr. Neil McNeil. Please bring back the original cast back to the film production."
2,Shocked and disappointed!,"I can't believe how much the quality of this series has gone downhill. Seeing someone other than Tyne Daly playing Miss Alice is almost enough to drive me to tears. No one can play Christy as effortlessly as Kellie Martin did. Thankfully Dr. McNeil is still played by the same actor, and he has become the only good reason to keep watching. The producers should have done anything, everything, whatever it took to re-assemble the original cast."
1,Christy???,"If you watched the Christy series and were left dieing the know the outcome...like me, you will be SOO disappointed with this video. The acting is HORRIBLE. It was hard to sit through and actually watch it all (but I had to know the ending!). The quality of cinematography was very poor as well. Don't waste your money on it!!! Truly a let down!!"
4,New Christy,"This new casting for Christy is good, and includes some old favorites as well. Lauren Lee Smith does a wonderful job as Christy, and the story isn't as choppy as the original Christy movie."
4,All Great Original Songs as Played on AM Radio,"Every one is the real thing 'taken from the original masters tapes'.The title is a bit strange as most of us in America, the 'invasion' started with the Beatles in '63 but this collection of JUST 10 tracks starts in '64 and goes all over the place [no Beatles or The Rolling Stones of course] and ends in '78. No way! Gary Glitter and Bonnie Tyler do not even begin to fit a invasion scenario. The 2nd British Invasion I believe really started in 1981 in any case.The PoliceDire StraitsCulture ClubWham!Tears For FearsPaul YoungDuran DuranSimple MindsU2Elvis CostelloThe PretendersNick LoweGary NumanSqueezeSpandau BalletABCGo WestTears For FearsHoward JonesHuman LeagueAnd many more...but none of them are here on this collection."
3,It's OK,"This charm is just OK. I like that it's finished on all sides. But I've seen prettier bicycle charms elsewhere. I haven't put it on my charm bracelet yet because I don't like it well enough. I may give it along with a charm bracelet, to my 4 year old neighbor when she learns to ride her new bike."
4,Spinal Tap for the gore and boobs set...,"If you don't know the hilarious and near brilliant work of underground filmmaker Andrew Shearer this is a great way to jump in head first. This is his only feature length film to date, but it brings all his obsessions together in one headlong dive into dementia. FAKE BLOOD is like SPINAL TAP for the gore and boobs set, telling the tale of a very frustrated no budget filmmaker trying to contend with crazy actors, bad special effects, insane schedules, and over all obtuse obstacles that make for REALLY funny movie watching, but not movie MAKING. If you love Christopher Guest movies or low budget exploitation films, this should be right at the top of your list of things to watch. Shearer is a rare talent among his peers because he has a real knack for knocking out intelligent scripts, witty dialogue and filling his films with real heart and soul. This one is no exception. So dig in and enjoy it!"
5,An Exceptional Film!,"The LA Times Reviews of this movie described it as ""an exceptional family film!"" It's more than that ... its an exceptional film, period.The authors of this movie took something from nothing, an idea about imaginary friends, and wove it into a rich tale that tugs on your emotions and evokes a parabole about coming of age and of moving on from mental illness."
4,liked it,I rented this movie because my mom and I are going to Australia and I have looked for movies related to the trip. This was much more than an intro to a bit of Australian culture. The child actors are especially good. You don't even think about them being actors because they just seem like kids being kids.
4,"Probably the worst in terms of the wrestlemanias, but taker kane makes it must own.","After Hogan left, and the WCW took a lot of the key wrestlers, this was the couple of years I got out of wrestling. I have to admit that I was more into Nitro, and that I missed Stone Cold and the Rock the first time around. It seems that they were really looking to make stars of new tallant, and the XI and XII it seems like they are a little lost in what direction to take it, but the Undertaker Kane match and the Austin Rock match are amongst the best spectacles I have ever seen in wrestling. Overall though, not so great."
4,Wrestlemania!!!,"Unfortunately during these 5 Wrestlemanias you see wrestling lose its innocence. By WM 13 you see and hear things that you don't see and hear on the first 12 WMs. There are still some very entertaining matches, but from a Christian perspective, it's a bummer. So long Hulkster, here comes Stone Cold and the Rock."

4,Works well but a little long,The grater seems to work well. The cover is really nice to have. It is a little long. We haven't had it that long so we don't know how it holds up over time but so far works great.
3,"Great pliers, stinky handle cover",The pliers are sturdy and work as expected. But the plastic grip smells really strong and stunk up my tool box. If you have a sensitive nose then don't buy this product due to the funky-smelling grip.
1,Blah!,"I hate the fact that nobody mentions that this is ""1 Bands"" interpretations of these songs. I also hate the fact that it's like listening to some crummy coverband. Yes I understand from the CD notes that these guys love QOTSA and thats cool but their interpretations of the songs are almost exactly how QOTSA play them. BOOOOORIIIIING.I say avoid this like oprah. Stick with special consensus. Now theres a band you can set yer watch to! yee haw momma!"
4,"Cool Blues, re-issue from a guitar legend.","A great remastering job of the 1989 record,recorded in New Orleans with vocalist Darrell Nulisch and James""Thunderbird"" Davis with Ronnie Earl and the Broadcasters backing. A couple of great live tracks and nine others recorded the following day in the studio. This is a very valuable recording from Howlin' Wolf's guitarist, on most of his records. Sumlin's menacing,sharp licks licks are still present as he fronts a great band and strong vocalist.Sumlin has played with and influeced them all, Hendrix, Clapton Santana and still has much to offer.A piece of history from a pre-rock 'n' roll legend."
3,"healing feeling, a good effort, my review from Barcelona","Everything Hubert Sumlin - guitarist and companion for 23 years of Howlin Wolf', one of the monsters of Chicago Blues - does is in principle good and this 1989 'HEALING FEELING' is no exception. Furthermore, in this record he is wonderfully backed by one of the best five guitarists of all time, the great RONNIE EARL. It also features JAMES ""Thunderbird"" DAVIS, doing vocal work, the magnificent DARRELL NULISCH, vocal and harmonica, and MARK ""Kaz"" KAZANOFF's tenor sax.. All songs are on the same high level, but I like to highlight SUMLIN's guitar in the BLUES ""Down the Dusty Road"", the 60's,70's flavour in ""Come Back little Girl"" and the big slows ""Play It Cool"" and ""Blues for Henry"". I give it 3.5 stars"
4,New or Used?,"Although this little radio/MP3 system is pretty decent, the capacity isn't what I'd hoped for music storage. The radio, however, was my main impetus for purchasing it, and it does the job excellently. I am dissappointed, though, to discover that it was refurbished when I deliberately chose to purchase the only one offered on Amazon as New in Box, paid a little more for it for that reason, and when it came it was obviously used with a limited warranty. Not so cool Amazon."
2,Lousy for Podcasts,"I don't usually don't have problems with installing new hardware (I used to work in IT), yet this system is a mess. Software installation CD didn't come with it as the instructions indicated, creating software problems. Philips customer service simply tries to get you off the phone and have you call back to talk to somebody else. They've had me call back three times and now call another company. I've been working on this thing for 3 hours trying to set it up, and it still won't recognize standard MP3 files. I can't comment on whether the unit is any good, since I can't get it to store a single MP3."
2,No better than other cheap hoses,"Kinks easily, hose came off connector after ~ 1 hour of use. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too expensive for the medium quality."
4,In Seven Years You Won't Recognize Yourself,"The last chapter twist is a pleasant surprise if you are already aware of what he reveals there, and a rude awakening if you are not. Either way, a re-read is called for to fully get the message of the book. Written as a retrospective of the author's youth (and self-confessed folly), we will see glimpses of ourselves and all the silly things we believed as children.Might just as well have given it 5 stars but I have to fault the author for being just a bit, boring, between the good bits. Still a great effort and a great book to have."
2,Disappointing,"I tried to like this book, but he seems to be contradicting himself. Writing yet another life-path novel. His insights are shallow, memoir less than exciting and overall conclusion a disappointment."
5,Rosie and the Rustlers,My two sons are now 18 & 20 years old and I bought it for him this Christmas.We read this book at least 30 times when they were around 7 years old.I puchased this for my younger son he could enjoy reading it to his children some day. It has great illustrations and a wonderful ryhming story line.
5,Great Upgrade!!!,Replaced the old dry rotted rubber bushings with these; by comparison it feels like the front axle actually stays under the truck. Very smooth yet firm feel. Steers much straighter as well so helps with the alignment too saving expensive wear on the tires.One thing to note: the bushings in the image are red while the ones I recieved are black; they work the same and I prefer the black so its ok for me but if you are trying to keep all your bushings red this might be an issue.
5,The best one out there,"I've seen a number of tornado documentaries and have to say this one is the best I've seen. You get wrapped up in the storyline as the scientists and interns from the National Severe Storms Laboratory plan their chase.Unlike other documentaries that are slapped together with some footage to try and sell you something, you immediately sense how genuine these scientists are. You can tell how passionate and sincere they are about their fascination with severe storms (tornadoes) ... This one is a keeper, one you'll want to watch several times."
1,Watched it once,"I purchased it for my students to show them the power of wind. Old footage, not great in comparison to what is shown on TV. Never showed ot to my students because it is just not ""cool"" enough. I am sure if this documentary was redone by NOVA today it would be significantly better. If you are looking for short impressive footage you will have more luck on the internet."
4,once and future,These thoughts in passing by Thomas Merton provide both a reminder of how things were back when they were written and how much and how little some things have changed. not at all what I expected from Merton.
2,ok,"These shoes are cute, but they have a weird fit. The back of the heel comes up higher than regular shoes and it gave me quite a blister when I wore them for a walk. They are not terrible. Perhaps I should have bought a half size smaller because there aren't any laces to tighten them up."
1,didn't work on my BlackJack phone,"The wall charger didn't fit into the Black Jack phone easily and once it was in got very hot and didn't charge the phone. After that I didn't bother trying the rest of the items, was afraid they would damage the phone."
1,not happy,"I purchased this for my brother-in law in another state. None of the adapters worked, and we decided it would not be worth the postage to return it."
5,Great quality product,"I have bought this brand of hand grippers for two years for my husband. First, I bought the 100 and 150 lbs and then this year the 200 and 250 lbs. He uses them daily and has had no problems and they show no wear and are as good as new!!"
4,Parliament Rocks!,"""Osmium"" is a great glimpse into early Parliament. It sounds more San Francisco psychedelic rock than Detroit R&B funk in places, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It is funkier than other reviews would have you believe though. It's really a mixed bag of musical styles. There's something like a church organ throughout the album, and possibly a harpsichord(?). Hell, ""Country Boy"" even features dobro, lap pedal steel guitar, mouth harp, and yodeling. The thing is, the whole album really works. ""I Call My Baby Pussycat"" is one of their all-time greats. This is essential listening for any P-Funk fan. The guys are really Takin' Care Of Business here. You can't go wrong with George Clinton, Eddie Hazel, and Bernie Worrell!"
3,Rough around the edges but the birth of genius,"This is not a CD I would listen to straight through like some of the other Parliament albums but it's full of surprises. There are some amazing guitar licks in here, acid-coated stuff that was missing from the later releases and all the little creative touches that always made Parliament so entertaining are present, just in a more primitive form.You need to buy this CD, if only for ""Country Boy."" Who knew a steel guitar could funk?"
4,Pretty good,"The first parlament album. They were really showing their chops here, they could basically use any instrument even the harp. Much diffferent than the later disco sounding records. If you like motown and all the early funkadelic albums you'll probably like this."
4,Big Bang,"This is the DNA of the ""P""--these are the early tunes that show the direction that the funk mob was headed in--the multitude of genres, the silliness, the hardcore jamming, The way out topics, the overall black Zappa/Hippie vibe. Motown made the mistake of thinking they were too insane to sell, only later to cover there songs ""I'll Bet You"" and try to recreate their sound with ""The Undisputed Truth"" and several Temptations tracks ""Psychadelic Shack"" ""Papa was A Rolling Stone"" not to mention the Hazel penned ""Shakey Ground"" which featured Hazel & Billy Bass Nelson."
4,Osmium... Parliaments Very First...*******,"I love Parliament & ""Osmium"" is a fine fine album & a great introduction into the world of Parliaments music... a very well done album... the musical arrangements are excellent & this album is where it all started... It is one of Parliaments better albums in my opinion & it is better then most fans give it credit for..."
2,Looks great but it has some faults.,"This knob will look great inside your car. However, because it's painted metal. The paint will last for a year max and then the chrome will start to peel off. And if you leave your car under the sun in a hot day the knob will heat up pretty bad."
4,Nice music but Lyrics are in Swedish!,"If you don't speak Swedish you may want to deduct a star.I don't speak Swedish but since I'm a Komeda fan I still enjoy the album.Actually its a double album, almost 80 minutes long.Most of the music is pleasant (a few off songs) and I like it.But I'd probably like it A LOT more if I spoke the language.Start with What Makes it Go, then try Kokomemedada, then Genius, and save this for last."
4,Pretty decent,"Originally bought for our room, then we moved and then put it in my daughters room. It is a pretty good dresser. the only thing wrong is one of 2 of the draws slide of track from time to time. Other than that it is sturdy and works great. I also bought the 3 drawer and haven't had any trouble with it. So all in all I like it."
3,"Cute and sturdy, just stains easily","We purchased this bib while on vacation at a cute store in San Francisco. It is VERY cute, and sturdy, but was stained after our daughter ate spagetti. We tried to scrub it off with a sponge, but that didn't work."
4,More than the title implies,"This is an excellent current selection for beginning Adorno students. The contents are much more generally useful than the title implies; this is not just a Holocaust-theory reader but a general Adorno selection of some worth. Since there's no other existing Adorno reader (that I know of) with such a broad, accessible, and interesting selection, this might be the one to pick for students not yet acquainted with his work. To me it looks like, for certain fields at least, this could end up being a counterpart to the well-respected ""Marx-Engels Reader"" as a broad introductory selection."
3,Author's comment,"From the author: I can't say that it's a literary jewel, but Political Sabotage does chronicle and explore the historical facts, law, and sociological attitudes that led to charges of ""systemic corruption,"" ""brutality"" and, ultimately, to an ineffective and still partly demoralized and inefficient Los Angeles Police Department. Through academic and police experience the ongoing politically formed and anointed commission and Federal Consent Decree attempts at LAPD's ""reform"" are examined through understanding and adjudicating related examples in the use of police force while defining the true culture and constitutional role of law enforcement. Even those experienced in the justice system might learn something more and relate to one or more of the relevant events and conflicted attitudes in society's mostly failed attempts to effectively control crime and violence in the United States. Take care, and be safe out there."
3,Do your research before you buy !,"I really can't say how well the code reader worked ! I bought the Equus 3143 code reader for 81-95 Ford $15.98 with s/h, when I received the code reader the package stated 81-95 Ford EXCEPT 1994 thunderbird w/ 4.6L which is what I have. I then got to pay for return shipping which was $13. Good Deal HuH !"
4,Balian Research Guidebook,"I found the Balian Graduate Research Guidebook to be very useful primarily because of his practicle approach. The content is clearly written and approaches difficult concepts of quantitative and qualitative research methods. It even includes a strategy for defense of your topic. I am looking forward to a new edition of this guidebook. However, this guidebook is still very useful."
3,Works fine so far but noisy,Installation was easy and the compressor cameclearly labeled that it was not shipped with oil. Added oil and charged system but the compressor did not quiet down much with time. I have driven the truck 500 miles with AC blowing cold but still has some bearing noise coming from the compressor.
2,Provocative Ideas; Scattered Organization,"The provocative ideas in this book have been cogently analyzed by other excellent reviewers. Here, I will add to the complaint that Hamrick's argument is extremely disorganized. Hamrick's rambling narrative should have been better reined in by the editors at Yale University Press. As a result of discursive and mostly scattered narrative, reading this book was as enjoyable as trying to run 10 miles after a full meal. Only the book's intriguing thesis saves this book from a one star review."
3,Still reading,Not far enough along to provide a review at this time - check back later in December when I hope to have completed the book.
2,DTD:KPDMGB,"This was a long slow read. The authors intended conclusion nearly gets lost because of the minutiae that he delves into to prove it. Also, way too many acronyms and various points repeated numerous times. Maybe interesting to an early cold war/spy historian, but otherwise I would avoid this."
4,Slightly uneven,"Homicide-The Movie is a nice wrapup to a fantastic seven-year run of the best show on TV. I like the idea of all the characters returning and the clever way it was handled. The movie, while it lacks the emotional intense punch of the first six seasons of the show, is good. it's just a bit uneven in the writing and acting. It seems like the writers tried too hard to combine the stellar writing and performances of seasons 1-6 with the less intense workings of season 7.For fans of the show, this is a great way to say goodbye to pembleton, bayliss, bolander, giardello and the rest of the squad. It's a worthwhile addition to the collection."
4,Avoid the overpriced used copies,"Amazon is offering a new set that has the entire series plus this movie and the Law & Order crossover episodes available for pre-sale in September 2009 at a price that is much less than what people are re-selling used copies of just the movie. So save your money and pre-order the set. If you already have the first seven seasons, wait. I am sure once the new set is on sale, the price for this movie will drop. Or order the new set and give the extra discs to someone as a gift."
4,Homicide: Life on the Street,"Yes, the plot was pretty thin, and the final scene, I'm still ruminating about... but it was terrific to see all the characters again. There will never be another episode. BTW, I recently took a trip to Baltimore and visited the Fell Point area and yes the Rec Center is still there but fading fast, and The Waterfront has changed hands and just doesn't feel the same..."
1,Ugh.,"In lieu of more colorful euphemisms, ugh will have to suffice. As a huge fan of Homicide, I have to strongly disagree with the raves about this movie. In direct contrast to those who praised this piece, I was highly disappointed and even affronted by it. Let me speak for the fans who love the show but thought this movie was meant more as a 'kiss-off' than a 'send-off'. It left me the distinct impression that Tom Fontana was bored with writing Homicide, and wanted to destroy any chance whatsoever that he would be forced to write the characters ever again. What better way to do that than by making Tim Bayliss a 'bad guy', and then by murdering Gee, thus destroying the guiding force of the squad? The final roof-top scene with Frank and Tim is some of the best acting you will ever see, but on the whole, I would have rathered this movie wasn't made at all. Homicide deserved a better ending than this."
1,Awful end for a great series,"I've been a huge fan, read the book, watched all the episodes when first run, and now purchased and watched all 7 seasons on DVD.The movie was simply terrible. The writing was bad. Melodrama at its worst. I wish I had never watched."
4,Rugrats!,"I saw this in 1959 in the theatre. If you like campy movies, you'll love this one.It had dogs wearing rugs, a knockout blonde as heroine and a true-blue hero who figures out in the end how to get off the island. It a tale of science gone bad; it was the Cold War Era, what do you want?"
3,shlock but for fans of shlock.,"I like shlock movies , but to a non fan this is a ONE star movie. It's very low budget and features dogs with things put on them as the monsters. It's standard d movie stuff from the fifties. b movie is much higher budget than this; but at least it has good actors in it. Still If you can't sit back and enjoy shlock without tearing it to pieces then why watch it? I can put it all aside and still enjoy the plot and such for this movie, I can even go as far as to see why the 'shrews' whould be dangerous. That takes effort but If you can't do it then perhaps shlock is far from what you like ever. A real movie critic even then would destroy this movie in many ways but How about a shlock movie critic? no, they'd like it's pure awkwardness."
3,The Killer Shrews (1959),"this is B-movie madness at its best.When Captain Thorne Sherman docks at an isolated island to drop off supplies, he becomes stranded by a hurricane. The island is also inhabited by a mad scientist Dr. Milo and his beautiful daughter Ann. Another scientist, Dr. Craigis, has been conducting tests to prevent overpopulation by shrinking humans. Accidentally in the process he creates a race of giant shrews that manage to escape during the storm.After the beasts devour all of the island's animal inhabitants, they turn their voracious appetites to human cuisine. No one is safe- not even the scientist that created them. And the only way to survive is to somehow make it off the island..B&W;, rated PG"
3,The Taming of The Shrew,"Another One and A Half Star low-budget 1950s sci-fi movie that transcends its ridiculous self, THE KILLER SHREWS is about a strange experiment in enlarging this widespread, small, but incredibly vicious and venomous mammilian predator.Why anybody would want to enlarge shrews is is a question I hope nobody can answer. These giant killer shrews are played by somebody's pet dogs who have been forced into zip-up fur suits that are topped off by dreadlock wigs and phony-looking fang extensions. The shrews snarl constantly on the soundtrack. The dogs never do. As a matter of fact, the poor dogs all have the grace to look embarrassed. Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, and Ol' Yeller would probably laugh themselves sick or call the ASPCA or at least the Screen Actors Guild if they could have dialed the rotary phones of the era. Unintentionally funny, THE KILLER SHREWS was a favorite on the Saturday night Creature Feature circuit."
3,Quirky and Fun,"This is not Gillgans Island. The Shrews look like they have bad makeup...no matter ...this is a fun picture ,it doesnt waste much time...delivers some suspense...and the Shrews eat through the walls to get to the folks inside.Now with the stunning Ingrid Goude in the house...If I were a shrew I wouldnt waste my time with Mr. Best et al.Finally, where did they get those sound effects for those shrews...??CP"
4,A Black an White Classic!,I remember seeing this moving as a small child and it stuck in my memory all these years. It took me an intense internet search to get the name of the movie again. If you love the old black and white horror movies...add this one to your collection. It be a good rainy night movie for the family.
3,Lame - - - But---,"The photography was horrible, the lines were spoken rather than acted, the shrews were about what you could expect for the budget (obviously low). The story line was about average for a ""B"" movie. Nevertheless I liked it and don't regret buying it. It is typical midnight monster movie fare, the kind I used to fall asleep in the middle of as a kid. If the production values had been better I would have given it 4 stars."
5,Awesome!!!,"If you like B, no C movie camp, this is it baby! It's got it all, bad dialog, horrible costumes, a ridiculous plot line, laughable special fx, if you can call them special, awful lighting, and a bunch of unknown actors giving this disaster their all. This this movie is so fun to get a big bowl of popcorn and just sit around and goof on, it took us 3 hours to get through it because we kept stopping it to point out stuff, then backing it up to see it again. The Killer Shrews is killer!"
4,One of the Worst,"Watched this the same day as Plan 9 From Outer Space. It's almost a dead heat as to which one is worse. Plan Nine is so bad that there shouldn't be any real competition, except for maybe Robot Monster, but this is at least in the running. Wow. what an afternoon. I felt so bad, so used, that I had to watch an Abbott and Costello movie afterward. then I felt better."
1,I believe you mean THE KILLER DOGS DRESSED IN CARPETS,A group of people are terrorized by vicious overgrowm shrews on an island off the coast of Texas. I don`t have much else to say about this oftentimes double-billed with THE GIANT GILA MONSTER horror flick. Except that this is perhaps the worst horror film ever. And that only watch this film if you`re ready to laugh at the dogs dressed in carpets pretending to be killer shrews.
4,Checked out,"I would have liked to have known that this had been a library book, complete with cover, stickers and bar code. It also came with a note inside from a previous reader who thought that a degree at Notre Dame might have saved her from reading this book with a dictionary. Who knew, a book that makes you think while you are enjoying the story? Its a mystery!"
4,Awesome Cold Swedish BM,"BEST SONG is Odium Generis HumaniThis release doesn't top Diabolical, nor does it introduce any new elements however it's a great album for the fan. One thing that struck me was striking resemblance of Kristoffer's vocals to that of Shagrath. Good work!"
5,this band sounds like bleath metal,"Naglfar does a good job on their new album. they are a part of a growing number of black metal bands that are now relying on musicianship rather than speed, such as Borknagar and Bal Sagoth. Naglfar doesn't have a keyboard player, so you don't have to worry about it dominating most of the songs. their music sounds like a mixture of black and death metal, most commonly called bleath metal. the DVD included with this album is a nice touch, as most metal bands are including DVD footage with their albums. will Naglfar release a new album next year? hope so!"
2,Informative and a great start,This book is helpful to those interested in starting their own business. It basically gives a rought draft of the business itself and what is needed to get started.
2,frustrating and cursory,"This book, while certainly full of useful information, was somewhat frustrating to read. I found that it did not delve deeply enough into the specifics of a WEDDING PLANNING business. I can (and have) bought numerous books specifically relating to the process of starting any small business, and in purchasing this book, had hoped for information on the things that I hadn't already thought of (or read elsewhere). In addition, I was concerned by the apparent lack of proofreading and editing. There were a number of ridiculous misprints, as well as inexplicable transitions within chapters. It seems like the author was more concerned about having written and published a book than putting out a quality product with new and progressive ideas. The purpose of a specialized book like this should be to DELVE deeply, while Ms. Chatman-Whitfield seems to give a cursory look at each chapter. If nothing else, I think the price should be lowered!"
2,Not Enough Info on Wedding Consulting,"This book may be great for those who just want basic small business information...but the book claims to tell people everything they need to know about being a wedding consultant--and it doesn't even come close to doing so.Instead of providing insider info, or even just great tips on being a wedding consultant and starting a consulting business, this book is mostly about basic business practices.In my opinion, this is an over-priced book, also, and I couldn't return quickly enough."
1,I agree- Don't bother,"If you are looking for a book full of lists, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for an insightful book all about how to start a wedding consulting business, then you'd better look elsewhere. I didn't get anything out of reading this book, and I'm glad I only checked it out from the library!"
1,"""I Do""...Weddings: Guide To Starting Your Own Wedding Consul",The book gives very generic information. For the money that I spent I was looking to get a whole lot more. The book's construction is not the best. My copy started to come apart after having it for a week. I would say that this publication is a waste of money.
1,Potential plagiarism mars strong advice,"Ms. Chatman-Whitfield takes a comprehensive look at the wedding planning business in an easy-to-read format that ought to be helpful to beginners. Unfortunately, the book is marred by lack of attributions to sources used by the author. The excellent section on press releases, for instance, appeared word-for-word in Michael Levine's _Guerilla P.R._, published four years earlier than Ms. Chatman-Whitfield's book. All of us learn from other people's experience, of course, but it's uncanny that both Ms. Chatman-Whitfield and Mr. Levine comment that: ""I've marveled at elegantly crafted releases from amateur do-it-yourselfers, and I've held my nose reading releases from top corporations, written so poorly as to defy belief."" Twins separated at birth?"
3,Too light weight. Not really rectangular pattern,Too light weight. Not really rectangular pattern since water spray out at different pressure. It won't stay flat because of the light weight.
1,UGH!,"I have had enough of Raven!!!!!! She is tacky. She plays as a psychic teen, and can NOT sing. And the word Supernatural, means super-human. So by singing that song she is telling us that she is super-human. I just don't like Raven. I like several teen stars, including Hilary Duff. Mary-Kate and Ashley are OK, and I like Diana DeGarmo's music. She is about the same age as Diana, and has probably not had half as much practice as Diana. Diana is sooooooooooooooooo much better than Raven! I wonder how far Raven would make it American Idol. Probably not second place! I sure wouldn't vote for her. Raven wears waaaay to much makeup, unlike Hilary Duff. I don't know if I'll ever be a fan of Raven's."
1,Don't quit your day job just yet Raven,"It scares me to think that anyone can get a record deal while more talented artists struggles to get even an A&R person to come to their show. Child star Raven Symone (who was hideously annoying on ""The Cosby Show"") is yet evidence that some people don't deserve a record contract. Her cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"" for that one Eddie Murphy movie she made last year was atrocious. Why remake a classic song and ruin it? Pop music continues to go further down the drain with people like Raven and William Hung."
1,I've Heard Better,"To me this is a terrible soundtrack. I think the beats or okay but the lyrics are so stupid they sound like Kidz Bop s***. There is only 2 halfway decent new songs on the album they are The theme song and Supernatural. The old songs are cool. But if you really want to hear some pop talent. PLEASE BUY RAVEN SYMONE'S ALBUM "" THIS IS MY TIME"". That Album is real pop. For the Producers of this album I would be like Donald Trump and say ""YOUR FIRED""."
4,its ok,raven can sing good but i think she should stay with being a actres the songs in the soundtrack are ok this cd its ok not the best
4,Shine,"If you saw the musical episode of ""That's So Raven."", you know that this just show what Raven can do. Bravo. Well, done"
3,Simply too fragile and out of date,"Once upon a time the finest handmade glasses to be had but times change. These Riedels as simply too fragile, We bought 4 and are now down to just two. We have since moved on to the German wine glasses (Schott Zwiesel Enoteca)."
4,Its what you expect,"I'm not sure of the origin of this video, but it definitely feels like an MTV or VH1 produced 1-hour bio.Katy herself does not appear or endorse, and the talking heads comprise the like of the L.A Times editor etc...If you are a fan, then this is worth the $20. You get a pretty decent look at her past; there was plenty of new info about her that I never knew.I would liked to have seen more clips of Katy, esp behind the scenes or of her private life, but for what it is, an unendorsed biography, its not bad at all."
2,Disappointed with the quality of sound,I was disappointed with the quality of sound of this video. In the age of HD and better digtal sound it sounded like it was recorded on a cassette.
2,shower caddy,"The shower caddy we received does not look like the one in the picture. We chose it because the hook direction could be changed so we could hang it on a towel rack. As the one we recived was made differently than the shower caddy in the picture,we could not do this. The only reason we kept it is because my husband took it apart and remade it to work for our needs."
1,"Rust, rust, rust","I purchased this caddy in May, 2012. The wires in the basket I use to hold shampoo bottles have already begun to rust, just barely two months after installing it in my shower. This is unacceptable at this price for an item that will daily be exposed to the moist conditions to be poorly manufactured. What it means is the steel wires have such thin coating of chromium that the coating provides no corrosion protection. Shame on Zenith Products!"
4,Generally good,I bought this recently and hung it the first day. By morning the smooth plastic clip used to hold the top part in place had slipped down behind the shower head. This caused the caddy to move far enough away from the shower surface that the bottom suction cup did not connect. I found a solution by spraying the clip with a liquid vinyl coating. So far it is holding. I have liked everything else about the caddy.
3,Hard Read,"Although this book is interesting at times, I found it to be a very difficult and slow read. I was not captivated by the story, therefore I stopped reading it after getting almost 3/4 of the way through the book...it was just not enjoyable for me to read this book. If you are like me and not a speedy reader, I would not recommend attempting to read this book."
3,I thought this book really expressed the struggle of a famil,"this book really inspired me, it also opened up a very different side to me about slavery."
3,Kindle version has issues,"Roots is a 5+ star novel. However, I purchased this version for Kindle and there are numerous spelling, typing, and punctuation errors that do not exist in the original novel. They aren't enough to detract from the reading experience, but I think the Kindle version should be offered with the same quality that is expected from a printed novel."
5,The story of Kunta Kinte is powerful and very emotional.,"I was very intrigued with Alex Haley's description of Kunta Kinte's life before he was captured. Then, the tale that follows of seven generations that struggled for freedom is powerful, gripping. I found myself crying for all the hardships the family was forced to endure. The sad tale of family separation, whippings, and rape paints a vivid image of life for slaves. A terrific book; I am on my third reading of it."
2,Alex Haley: Plagiarist,"Unfortunately, most people don't know that a lot of this book was lifted word for word from a book called ""The African"" by Harold Courlander. None of Haley's family history is correct prior to Reconstruction. Roots is non fiction taken from a book of fiction. Courlander sued Haley who settled with Courlander out of court (because he knew he would lose), but asked Courlander to stay quiet about the plagiarism. But once Courlander died, the word was put out how Roots and Alex Haley were a fake, but since now it's taught in schools as the truth no one wanted to rock the boat. Even the very liberal Village Voice acknowledged that Roots was fake but no one paid attention."
4,A thought provoking book,"The first 150 pages are rather slow but once you make it through that the book gets more interesting. Although the writing is not so good, the subject matter and story are stimulating. I had never thought much about slavery prior to reading the book and found the book thought provoking. Reading a book set from the perspective of the slaves really highlights their suffering and allows one to imagine how it would feel. I recommend this book for the subject matter rather than the writing quality."
5,Top 3 greatest books ever written,"I would put this 2nd only to the Bible. This is truely a book for the ages. Very emotional. You just have to expeience it for yourself. This book, in a way, changed the world."
5,Unforgettable Experience,Roots is an unforgettable experience in both visual and reading senses.I cannot forget watching the miniseries in 1977 on TV.Each whiplash that Kunta Kinte got for refusing to call himself Toby felt like cutting into my back.Kizzie getting sold must be the all time heart breaker on TV and fiction.This scene and the book in general has affected my life in many ways.A must read because it can affect your life for the good.The book must be made required reading in schools.
1,"Loved the story, disappointed with editing","The poor review is by no means a reflection of Roots, the book. The story deserved 5+++ stars - it was moving, captivating, enlightening, depressing, joyous, and worth every single one of the 888 pages it took Alex Haley to spin the story.However, I was shocked at the number of typos that dotted this edition of Roots. They were everywhere! I'm accustomed to a few throughout an entire book - certainly not a few per chapter, as I found in this edition.So, readers, know that, if you buy this edition of Roots, you're in for a truly marvelous story, one that I believe every American should read at least once in his or her lifetime...just also prepare yourself to grit your teeth at plentiful typos.Just a friendly warning!"
5,Roots,"This book goes through generations and generations of slavery and black culture starting in the 1750's. It not only touches the heart but makes you think and hassuspense. I would reccommend this book to anyone who is interested in their heritage or slavery, the civil war, and the recovrey of the civil war. This book is probably the best book I have ever read and I hope you read it too."
4,If you often wish you were born somewhere else ..,"Its a must read.. It has all the goodness of fiction, and all the weight of reality... You will know your way through the ancient African village, you'll respect their customs, appreciate their values. You will live a lifetime faraway from yours... Once you are done, you'll feel you know the family so well, you'd want to visit them and talk of ol' times...."
5,Gutwrenching,"I read this book when it first came out and saw the miniseries. Now 35 years later I am re-reading several of my all time favorites. This was one of them! I just can't, for the life of me, understand how people (supposedly civilized) could treat other human beings so horribly. It is just gutwrenching. Can you imagine being separated from your family, being taken to a place you didn't know existed, worked to death and then be expected to be greatful to your ""benefactors"" for taking good care of you! Oh, brother!"
3,disgraceful typos,"Roots is one of the best books I've ever read, but after reading this newly released edition, I'd recommend readers find an older copy. The first section is riddled with typos and grammatical errors and so is the last section, obviously the book was edited by more than one editor because the rest of the book is perfect.It's a disgrace that such a great book was allowed to be reprinted in such a sloppy fashion. Readers, shop around for a copy from the '70's if you want to enjoy this book as it deserves to be."
3,Review for the Abridged Audio,"Disclaimer that I have not read the original and the review is meant for those looking to buy the abridged audio book. The narration starts with the life of Kunta Kinte which is probably the best part of the book whose sudden loss of freedom, gradual acceptance of slavery and a forced identity is gut wrenching, and continues well to the life of Kizzy his daughter. The narration loses intensity once Chicken George grows up, with too much details on cockfighting, and less focus on the human angle which made the Kinte episodes gripping. To my disappointement, the Civil War times were glossed over too quickly and thereafter almost became a rapid reciting of names of successive generations and their occupation, till we reach Haley's generation.My suggestion, if you have not read the original, go for the unabridged version."
5,An emotional masterpiece,"Never before, has any book had an effect on my personal philosophy of myself and my history as this. My family too were slaves, but until this novel came into my hands and I read it's texts rich with history, have I felt a connection to them. I knew, of course, that my family had come from slavery, but slavery had never been presented to me in this manner before. The fear of kidnapping from Africa, The terrible realities of the middle passage, and the life on the plantation. IT made me realise what they endured so that I would be here today. It's made me reflect on the ancestors from wence I came, and made me say ""Thank you for surviving."" Haley must have been moved by his work as much as I was, to have written it with such passion."
5,A wonderful Classic,A great story of an American family finding their roots. This is well wrote and is worth the time to sit down and ready it. It puts the history of the US in another light and reminds all that we all have a history and with just a few key words and a desire to find out more we to can learn much about our family past.
4,Thought provoking treatment of true friendship.,"Although not my absolute favorite Gene Stratton-Porter book ( The Keeper of the Bees would have to earn that honor), I found At The Foot of The Rainbow to be quite rewarding reading. The characters, setting, dialogue/dialect, and virtues are classic Porter; the issues and values are timeless; and the thought provoking manner in which she concludes her story leave one considering their own lives on a deeper level. Well worth a few hours of reading(one of her shorter novels) and several more of soul serching to follow. A highly recommended book for young and old!!!!!!!"
3,Satisfied,I enjoyed this book overall but found the plot line to be much darker than the other books by this author that I have read. It has a happy ending and the reader easily sympathizes with the characters I just didn't enjoy it as I did Freckles and A Girl of the Limberlost.
1,Exactly the same as A Remarkable Life,"It just has the a different cover and no footage as describe. The description is not at all what is on the dvd. Total waste of money. I personally hated A remarkable life, am very unhappy to be fooled into buying it again."
1,Don't Purchase This CD!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! This CD is an exact copy of: ""Michael Jackson: A Remarkable Life."" It is poorly done, and boring! I'm a huge fan and this CD disappoints me greatly!!! It has no music or pictures of Michael Jackson. It is VERY misleading. I am very angry about this purchase and feel taken by it.FYI: According to the CD covers, ""A Remarkable Life"" was done by Chrome Dreams in 2003. ""Never Surrender"" was supposedly produced by ""Silver and Gold Productions"" in 2009. It appears that ""Silver and Gold"" just repackaged the CD and is selling it too. I'm disgustingly disappointed!!"
1,This is a rip off!,This DVD is not as described. It is not authorized by Jackson. It is the same exact DVD of Remarkable Life.This is someone trying to make money off of Michael Jackson's death.Stick with the DVD's that he put out.
1,boring!,"i was so boring, you know i bought the book remarkable life.and got on line after i bougfht it, and people said don't buy this it is boring.so i sent it back and i wish i would have waited to see how this one was ,because i wasted my money.do not buy this dvd, it is not worth it ,next time i well wait and review what ever i buy about mj."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"As other people have said, it's a total waste of money. I hadn't seen ""A remarkable life"" but thanks to other reviewers, I now know not to get that either as the two are exactly the same and neither of them are worth the money.It's just a collection of people I've mostly never heard of, who had some connection with Michael through his work, talking about what they remember about him as though they were close buddy-buddies with him. Hardly even any pictures of Michael, let alone music. Looks to me like it's a totally unauthorized piece of junk, put together by some vultures who want to squeeze money out of his name.Very disappointing!!!"
1,Disappointing,This DVD is nothing close to how they marketed it. Save you money. A remarkable is cheaper and is the same documentary. I can not believe I was cheated like that. This product represents what Michael himself was against. He loved his fans and wanted to give them their moneys worth not cheat them.
3,Not quite as pictured but still fine,"I bought this closet rod to convert a large entertainment bureau into a wardrobe. The picture makes it appear as if all pieces would line up flush against the wall but in fact the top screw hole is bent at a 90 degree angle. Very easy to bend back into the place I needed it, but still not quite as I'd intended. Overall, the product is fine."
2,it sags,"I installed this rod between two walls by screwing it into the studs. The distance between the two walls is about sixty inches (60"") so I was happy to find this adjustable rod for sale on Amazon. It installed very easily. After I installed it I hung some jackets, shirts and pants on it. Because of the ""play"" between the two adjustible pieces, this rod sags in a way that makes it look like a smiling face. I will keep this item because I am confident that it is secure into the wall studs. However it looks very bad and I am scared that it might fail some day. Made in China, gets one star ""deduction"" from me on that variable."
5,An excellent insider's guide to understanding Congress,"I'm a chief of staff to a Member of the House of Representatives. I give a copy of this book to every new staffer who comes to work in our office, and tell them it's mandatory reading. Simply put: Mr. Oleszek's book is the single best reference out there for students and citizens wanting to learn about the ins and outs of how a bill becomes a law. What makes the book a must-read is not just the author's experise in understanding how Congress works, but also his ability to write extremely readable prose."
4,Hot Blues!,"Albert King recorded this CD on Wednesday June 26, 1968, one day prior to his more popular and better known release, ""Thursday Night In San Francisco"". This disc represents the first day that Albert performed at the Filmore as the headliner. Prior to that time, he had appeared as the opener for Jimi Hendrix and John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. Albert's ""best"" performance that evening, as well as the next day, (according to Stax anyway) was originally released by Stax on the ""Live Wire/Blues Power"" CD. The songs contained on both, the Wednesday and the Thursday CD were thought to be a cut below and were not included. Fortunately for us, Stax took another look at the material, albeit 22 years later, and released the remainder of the material as it occurred on two separate discs. In order to gain a full understanding as to what occurred on those two nights, King fans should purchase all three of these excellent recordings. As with the other two discs, King's performance is outstanding."
1,F for sound,"Well this is a total F for sound. I have 3 dif 3 cd players, home, port, and car, and yes they are good ones, car is a Q45 with a Bose. I bought this CD because of the reviews I read here, what is everyone smoking? or is there not that good of stuff avail from Albert? I don't own any other CD's, but I do know about him from the SRV Sessions VHS I have had for a few years, and it sounds pretty good.This CD sounds like a taper recorded it, from that last row in the back or something. I have both SF CD's, the both sound the same.Can someone email me please and let me know what Albert King CD's. If any, have good clear sound.What I have that is great for Live shows is Cream Reunion DVD and CD, and Roger Watters in the Flesh DVD and CD, great sound.Listened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear."
4,Works great but missing on/off switch,The grill works great. Used it for a few parties and we enjoyed it. The small trays and scrappers wash in the dishwasher without issue. The only thing I don't like is one has to pull the plug to turn it off.
3,Non-stick coating flakes off.,"I love the adjustable heat control, and this is great for fun, social meals. However, my only complaint is that every time I wash it, it seems to lose more of the non-stick coating. I don't scrape it excessively or put it in the dishwasher, I just wash it by hand with a sponge. I'm disappointed that most of the coating is gone after having the grill for about a year..."
4,You can't beat Raclette!,"I first tried a Raclette prepared meal in 2002 while visiting my fiancee's parents in Lyon, France. Needless to say I was hooked straight away. Although Raclette meals can be heavy (potatoes, cheese and various meats and veg), they are extremely good.The Hamilton beach 31602 raclette grill is great. Temperature control is a nice feature. I have used it a lot since I bought it and recommend it. Good value for money and even has some recipes to try in the instruction manual."
4,My Hamilton Beach 31602 Raclette 8-Person Parety Grill,"I like what I've seen about the product. This is ideal for a small family like mine, or, a batchelor entertaining about six or so friends as they watct superbowl. every household should have one as astandby."
3,great product except for the flaking of the top,"Love this product ,it is great for entertainment. Easy to use. But after a few uses the grill started to flake. Eventhough it was handwashed with a cloth."
2,too small for entertaining guests,It works but it's too small for more than 2 people. Also I'd rather have a flat surface to easily scrape the surface during use. Every time I take meat off I need to scrape the surface clean so it wont burn; this is harder to do with a ridged surface.
4,I want to live in Tuscany!,"I enjoyed Ferenc Mate's book very much - I loved his descriptions of the hills, the people, the sunsets, the dusty roads, the shopkeepers - I felt like I was right there with him and Candace.I envy them. It takes guts to move to a foreign country, not knowing anyone, not knowing the language. Mr. Mate has given me much to think about. I can't wait to see the sunsets in Tuscany, but don't know about the rabbit stew...think I may pass on that."
4,"Witty, loving, and occasionally exceedingly funny","Like most people, when I decided I wanted to read about Italy, I began with Under the Tuscan Sun. While a good book, it bugged me to a certain extent - perhaps because of the slight odor of elitism that was contained within the pages. Mate, on the other hand, invites his readers with him on a more intimate, personal journey. His wife is not reduced to some distant other person who happens to be with him, but is a partner. We get as much of an impression of their life together as we do their life in Italy. I enjoy this book immensely, and it gets reread quite often, especially when I'm feeling all too American."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,"A wonderful tale of Mate and his wife deciding to settle down in Tuscany. The ups and downs of the language barrier, the dream houses which have been torn down to a knee high wall for a new barn, smokey 'real estate' brokers, and the older bachelor's 'funghi' flirtation with his wife. After finding the ultimate house, there was the addition of the well flavored family next door that kept things interesting. There was always something quirky going on, which I could picture it happening to me. Great read!"
5,New Life in the Hills of Tuscany,"I bought the book in hardback from Amazon about 5 years ago. After seeing a recent review on Amazon, decided to read the book again. I enjoyed the author's adventure in making new friends and discovering places close by. To me, this book seems more realistic than ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" in facing the challenges of finding a new home in a foreign land and culture. I enjoyed book and its message is a good reminder about the important things in life: Family, Friends, Good Food and Good Wine! Chin Chin Ciao!"
1,A boring string of cliches.,"This is really a tiresome, banal litany of predictable cliches about living a life of luxury in Tuscany. The first half of the book is about how he and his wife look for a house, while the second half is mostly about food. Everything, of course, is absolutely perfect--the tuscan light, the tuscan hills, the tuscan food. This book is kind of an unintentional parody of the genre.It's also poorly written. Mate has almost no descriptive powers per se. He just tells us how sumptuous everything is. He also uses hyperbole so consistently that his observations become pointless. I thought a book like this would be interesting, but it's just self-indulgent and dull."
3,Overall this is a good report of life in Italy.,"I, too feel that the book is poorly written. I had to go back several times to clarify what was being discussed and who the author was speaking about. If you know a little about Tuscany, it is a very enjoyable book to relive moments when time was spent there. The vivid transformation in the mind of memories past is always enjoyable."
3,the hills left me a bit queasy...,"The hills of Tuscany is not a bad read if your attention span is a little short , it is like a mindless sit com,harmless and even enjoyable if there is nothing else on. You do not have to concentrate as there is a very thin plot and characters are the same as all the other Tuscan books you ever read ,you can pick it up and put it down and never loose the meandering tread. The syrupy description are a little too sickly and the author's effort at being self effacing doesnt really come across as being funny,its all too cutesy and chummy. The down fall of this book is the smugness of the couple and their attitude to their surrounding,its is trying to paint a Picasso by numbers and it shows. Their version of the hills leaves me sleepy ,Ferenc Mate should take a leaf out of books such as A Year in Provence which is a real Classic."
2,Not for damaged hair,My hair takes abuse from coloring and a straightening iron. This shampoo left my hair dry. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this product.
2,"Good Value for the Price, but you may wish to spend more for better.","This is a fair, but very abridged dictionary.It is limited in scope. Also, very brief entries; for example, when you look up a noun in the English-Slovak section, the dictionary provides a Slovak word but not the gender - one must then go to the Slovak-English section to see the noun's gender in Slovak. (perhaps this is obvious for a more advanced student). It is also a bit strange that in some cases the English-Slovak translation does not appear in reverse in the Slovak-English section.Unfortunately I haven't found a good dictionary at a good price for Slovak, as there are for other languages. If you are a serious student, I think you will want to spend more for a better version. As a very basic reference, this book is a good value."
2,"Works with Vista, but the fan screeches","Contrary to other reviews I found that this card works fine with Windows Vista, but also contrary to other reviews I hate the fact that it has a fan rather than a heat sink. My once virtually silent desktop now has an extraordinarily annoying high-pitched screech. If I can't come up with a way to silence this thing I will have to remove it."
1,too slow,I bought this to upgrade my computer but this card was too slow and needed more power to make it useful in my computer. So I returned it.
2,The Man Who Fell to Mirth,"Picture an ""After School Spaghetti Western Special"" and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect with this. It's not exactly, ""Shane"". Bowie is an exaggerated stereotype of the psycho gunslinger replete with a trio of sycophantic miscreants, short-fuse temper, and a never-ending string of epithets.All the classic Grade B characters are present. The gentle half-wit, the prissy school m'a'rm,the dance hall girl with the heart of gold, and the aging gunfighter trying to hang it up.Yawn, it's all been done before...and better."
3,Where can I buy the Soundtrack???,The soundtrack alone makes this movie worthwhile - please post some information to let me know where I can buy a CD version of the soundtrack.
4,Rocker meets the old west,"I had expected this film to be...well... cheesy... but I was surprised.it was actually a decent film. The story is universal, and the actors make you care about each individual.. David Bowie puts in a great performance as a psychopathic killer."
1,This movie is the WORST...,"I'm a huge fan of David Bowie, Harvey H. and Wesern movies. SO this movie had winner written all over it from where I stood.What a painful movie to watch. Both Bowie and Harvey looked as though they wanted to be somewhere else. With the notable exception of one tearful scene between Harvy and his Daughter in-law this movie was void of anything that could be remotely called acting.Not surprising considering there very little story for the actors to leverage off of.I wanted to like this movie.Now I know why it was filmed in 1998 and not released in the U.S. for six years.Save your money and watch it on cable. While it is interesting to watch Bowie try to pull off a southern accent (and he DOES sing Battle Hymn of the Republic) there's very little else going for it."
3,Looking for more of an FCL reference,"Since it was so huge, I was expecting more of a reference book, and a lot of depth. But I was disappointed that it didn't touch on how to use the XML libraries or the Regular Expression libraries."
2,"Be aware, lot of rubbish reviews!","First, that book is not bad, I have to be honest, it is pretty ok. But god that book's boring, the author always repeats himself and often uses ""let's assume you want..."" expressions. Bloody annoying. Moreover I don't like the fact the code's incomplete. If you want to properly learn C# you need complete code, if not for Internet and dowloading the code you would be f***ed. So, yes that book is pretty okay but far from being The Classic!IRNBRU"
3,"Good material, poorly written","Troelsen covers the material well, but is irritating to read. The book must have been, like so many technical books, on an impossible schedule. I hope that's the reason they ran out of time to edit the text.Cliches and redundant phrases litter the text like weeds in a thicket. A thousand pages should have been five hundred. It's probably the best C#/.NET book out there, but it doesn't deserve five stars."
5,"If you only buy one C# book, this is it.",Andrew Troelsen is a great writer. His writing style is very easy to read and enjoyable (and how often is a technical book enjoyable?) The example are well thought out and interesting. I find myself turning to this book first in most cases. I hope Andrew comes out with a new version when the next version of C# arrives.
2,disappointing,"The songs selected are okay, but not great. The singer's voice is thin and unexceptional. I became very tired of his voice early on -- and there is only one vocalist. The prelude is over-long and seems somehow pompous. I highly recommend ""Songs of the Civil War"" by Columbia, Various Artists, instead."
1,Stopped working in three hours - lawn not finished,"In writing this review I have very mixed feelings and buyers remorse.First I would say that if you expect great customer service from the the manufacture, your not going to get it. I expected a vendor return with my product as it is defective, but the vendor is absolute in me sending it in for warranty work. After dropping a buck and a half you'd think they'd be concerned about reviews and such, but I guess not. Their stance is that it has a two year warranty and that how it should be handled.The reason I have mixed feelings is that my mom has the mower with no issues, in fact she is the reason I purchased it, but I see a train wreck coming and things for me usually only get worse with defective product..............I THINK I GOT A LEMON.Thank god for Amazon as they are taking a return!"
3,Takes A Little Getting Used To,"We have a challenging yard, sloped uneven ground and oddly shaped with a big side yard. I've divided the yard into 2 zones and I still can't get a complete job with a single battery pack. This weekend I'll chop it up into 3 zones to try to improve efficiency. I've also ordered a rapid charger and spare battery. For $1,200 you would think the rapid charger would be standard.Laying the perimeter wire is a real bear of a job. The mower does a nice job cutting. The multiple sharp blades is like an electric razor and the yard looks shaved instead of cut.Overall, we're not thrilled. Sure creates a stir in the neighborhood, though. Lots of stares as the mower merrily purrs along."
5,NEW FRIENDLY ROBOTICS MOWER,"EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE. MUCH BETTER MOWER THAN THE FIRST ONE DEVELOPED.ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT IT TAKES TOO LONG TO RECEIVE SPARE BATTERY PACK. ORDERED IN APRIL, RECEIVED IN JULY. THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED.LINDA ROBINSONSEMINOLE,TEXAS"
1,Song of the Sirens,Well I must say that I was lured to the thought of a mower cutting the grass while I was doing other things. You can say I was like a Greek sailor and the Robomower was the Sirens. Anyone who knows Greek mythology knows that the Sirens lead Greek ships into the rocks and sent the sailors to their death. Tis the story with the Robomower.For the high price of this mower I expected it to last more than 3 years without a major repair. My blade motor went out just after three summers of use. Since I live in Michigan my mowing season is quite short. Of course the mower is out of warranty. The cost of shipping for the repair and the repair itself is not a cost effective choice. I could purchase a low-end gas mower for the same amount.Seems to me the technology has a little ways to go yet. I wish you luck if you choose to purchase the Robomower. For me I am going to wait until they are better built. My recommendation is you do the same.
3,"Robomower looks good, tech support lacking","Mower received in good condition on schedule. A technical problem came up and to date, I have made 4 calls to technical support during normal business hours, and no one has answered, or returned the calls. I have now sent an email as well, with noresponse yet. They also list no authorized service centers for repairs, which leads one to believe they are few and far between. Definitely disappointed with the lack of tech support, especiallyon a product of this type. I am highly technically oriented, and find the instruction book containing errors, and very poorly written.John Lowell"
2,Technology is a Joke to date,"Yep I've tried this and it just won't do a REAL QUALITY job especially with tough lawns that have thick grass. I even had an electric in 1963 using a 12V battery and it still wasn't powerful enough to do the job right. I purchased a 12HP Murray 38"" Rider for $600 20 years ago and it still is running to date with ZERO Repairs except the deck has rotted a bit finally. Most things cannot be improved upon unless its a serious effort and not a gadget. Just like PCs now, nothing has seriously changed for several years and if you pay more than $400 for a good laptop your foolish.So in my opinion this is just another gadget for simple lawns and not a serious entry for large areas ever."
3,will not purchase again,it was a rather weak blend and way too pricey for 8oz of coffee. Unhappy with my purchase. will not purchase again
3,nothing special,"Just tasted like coffee, nothing special. I have never had Kona and thought it would be incredible since Kona is so expensive."
4,Great coffee,Great coffee. The swiss water method is the way to go and is much easier on your body. I like to add a teaspoon of sugar in the ground coffee before I brew it (cuts the acidity). Mmmh.
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for a really good special treat coffee - something very dark, but not bitter. Since I'm limited to decaf only once or twice a week, I want to be sure that what I'm drinking is special. This really wasn't it. So far, I've been happiest with Kicking Horse and Starbuck's Sumatra decaf, neither of which, unfortunately, is organic. My search continues."
1,A Wizard and a Warlord: The Adventures of the Rogue Wizard,"These were not after all available,but I got a very nice apology about it, so I don't think this transaction should feature anywhere in the suppliers resume,"
1,Tripe,I have read previous Robinson books and they were ok but this story is absurd. To believe that a major in the SAS would become a arab terrorist and to hide a boat in the Panama Canal when there are millions of square miles of ocean to hide it is stretching the imagination.I have read many cheaper books that were miles better than this.I don't think I will read any more Robinson books. Don't waste your money.
2,Author's agenda gets in the way of the story,"Having read a couple of previous efforts by Patrick Robinson (Kilo Class and HMS Unseen), I thought perhaps I'd stumbled across a half-decent new author. Those books weren't wonderful, but they were decent bathroom reads. Unfortunately this book is nearly unreadable. Robinson's political diatribes become extremely tiresome, and he spends long stretches on pointless dialogue and descriptions. At one point he takes a full page describing a Navy staffer's commute to the Pentagon for a crisis management meeting. The story frequently bogs down with these needless interludes.There are massive plot holes, and plot points that are so unbelievable as to be laughable. The prison escape, the Chinese plot to hide the submarine in the Panama canal rather than scuttling it in deep water, and the US Navy's impotence in the face of attack are a few examples.I gave it two stars rather than one because the plot was interesting. But it could have been so much more."
2,jump the shark,"Robinson has been a very good writer. I have listened to a lot of his other work. (Btw, Guidall does a killer Morgan, everyone should hear it once)However, I agree w/ other reviewers' comments fully about this book's shortcomings: Clinton, politics, hard-to-believe political plotlines, etc. I was especially disappointed by the rehashing of the oil-futures-doom plotline that was very similar to the oil-futures-doom plotline in the ""Shark Mutiny"".I hope Robinson is also disappointed by this work and brings us,in his usual style, a winner next time."
1,"Nice plot, horrible writing","What do you say when an author takes a good plot and mangles the execution?First, the research is falty. The author has no idea how the US would react to this type of threat. Has he nbever heard of AWACS?Second, the author seems to think more words are better. A little background is nice during a story, but why pad everything?Third, a black and white view of politicians is both childish and self-defeating. The author made the characters seem clueless in his voice over political tirades.Fourth, misplaced jargon makes the story ludicrous in places. How many English/Iranians use California pop expressions?Fifth, the dialog in general is pittiful. Words and phrases chosen for educated characters are weak, trite, and Bush league. (Sorry, could not resist.)"
1,Only because I can't give a book 0 stars,"Only because I can't give a book 0 stars did this one get 1 star.Patrick Robinson, do us all and yourself a favor and retire. Seriously, just put you pen down and do not write any more books. You had a couple of great military fiction works early on, but you have run your course.It is not a good thing when it takes over 70 pages to even get remotely interested in a book. And that's what Patrick Robinson has succeeded in with Barracuda 945. The characters are flat. The plot, what little there is in the beginning is boring, and the dialogue is crummy.I will not even glance at another Patrick Robinson book."
1,Attrocious,"Patrick Robinson makes the Israelis look like monsters, the Americans look like fools, and the Hammas terrorists and Arabs who call themselves palestians look like romantics."
2,"It should have been call ""Taking back the canal""","The story line was all over the place. Maybe, just so he can cover the whole gamut of genre. It was intriguing in that you wonder where the author is taking you. But alas to the disappointing ending. Thats the reason for the 2 star and I'm being very generous."
1,wretched,"Here, let me save you a few excruciating hours: Evil Islamiac terrorists buy a nuclear submarine and secretly sneak across the ocean to blow stuff up. However, a good solid American right-wing administration, led by hard-talking, cliche-speaking laughable caricature Arnold Morgan chase them down- almost. This book not only has no style and a contrived plot at best, the endless preponderance of simple-minded, sheerly idiotic right-wing rants and slights to democrats, greens, and anybody else who'se not a jackbooted thug wearing american-flag underwear will truly, as one reviewer says, turn a Bush supporter iinto a Dean fan. Please, for the love of humanity, save your money and don't waste your time!"
3,Bang of a start then fizzles at the end,"Love Patrick's detailed research studies in order to get precise information down on paper - the weapons, geographical topology, political strains, etc - but he got lost in Barracuda 945 story telling and seems as if he didn't know how to bring this chapter to a close. Instead of having Barracuda I disappear into the great depths of our oceans, after gonzoing the west coast of the US, he doesn't attempt to get the US Navy to scratch their balls trying to figure out where Barracuda I went. Instead he scuttles it in the Chinese(WTF?) run Panama Canal. OK its a done deal...right? No-o-o-o, he has the Navy Seals blowing up the Atlantic Panama Canal gates just to show the Panama Government who's boss. Stupid unrealistic fairy tale ending. That alone will leave you with a big HUH-DUH!?! But, hey, at least the ending put to me to sleep quickly."
1,Pure dribble,"I would agree with most of the reviews on here and would say that I was a Patrick Robinson fan until now. He should have re-named the book Clinton- the disaster. His plot also has one major flaw, as well as all the others that have been mentioned. How would attacking the Alaskan oil supply make the US MORE likely to become isolationist, as HAMAS and Iraq desire? It makes no sense!"
2,Not a good effort by Robinson,"This book should be called Barracuda 945 Part 1. Robinson uses this book as a platform for expressing his opinions on the Clinton Administration, Hollywood and the Oil Industry while straying from his roots as a sub warfare fiction writer. There is NO sub tactical warefare in this book and the author shows the U.S. ineptness at dealing with an enemy nuclear sub. Don't expect an ending because the author chose not to bring to a conclusion any of the story's major threads, which leaves this reader unsatisfied. I thought Robinson would learn his lesson from Hollywood that sequals are not better than the original."
1,Bad Read,"I am (was) quite a fan of Robinson, although I have been progressively dissapointed lately with each new novel. I tried to read this with an open and enthusiastic mind. Well, the beginning was okay. But one quarter of the way through I was battling terribly, I finished it out of duty. The days of Nimitz Class and Kilo Class are clearly gone, and are not coming back. The story is absurd. It moves at a painfully slow pace. The characters are undeveloped and dull. This book paints an idiotic view of the US administration. Okay, perhaps it is on the mark there presently, but Arnold Morgan is even more ridulous than anything I can imagine even in the current US administration, and there is a lot of latitude there already! The general flow of the story is all too predictable, and I cannot recommend it. If you've never read Robinson before, rather read Nimitz Class or Kilo Class. If you have, then don't touch it!"
1,selling out,"Patrick Robinson suffers from Tom Clancy Disease with Barracuda 945-not much of an idea,page after page of nothing happening,desperately in need of an editor to lop off the extra pages added to justify the outrageous price of the book and he even goes Clancy one better,the entire book was nothing more than a set up for a sequel.Patrick,what's with the excruciating geographical references,the making of the Admiral Morgan character into a cartoon,your repeated refences to the Clinton administration(hey,we didn't like him either but we don't want to read about him in your books)? I've absolutely enjoyed every one of your books but you should be ashamed if you cash any royalty checks for this rip off."
2,"Too implausible, too opinionated","I like P Robinson's other books but this one is both a stretch as well as a platform for childish name calling. Obviously, he hates democrats but this is supposed to be a novel not a billboard. I have yet to see a good military author resort to terms like ""conservation minded tree-hugger"" or ""whining democratic congressmen"". I'm ex-Navy and enjoy good military fiction but Robinson can peddle his war mongering jingoism elsewhere."
1,Just political posturing,"I am so sick of the political undercurrents in Patrick Robinson's books that I have stopped reading them. Though the stories are good, Robinson diminishes them by labeling and pigeonholing and demeaning anybody he does not agree with politically - especially Democrats. I stopped reading Scimiter SL-2 because I got so sick of it. I'm sure HarperCollins would sell more books if they could get him to stop the bashing."
2,Could've been a good book . . .,"... but there's WAY, WAY too much political preaching. First I must state that after spending almost 13 years in the military, there's nothing more that I like than a good military techno-thriller. Patrick Robinson's novels were high on my list of such authors --- until this one.Arnold Morgan was a strong believable character in Robinson's first two novels, but becomes crazed, growling and too unbelievable in this one. If Robinson would just leave his political rants out of his books, I would've rated this one much higher -- but I just got turned off by the many unavoidable preaching and degrating comments and references about our past (and present) U.S. leaders and policy makers."
2,"Good start, silly ending","I've read a number of Robinson's books and was pleased to begin this one. Terrorists buys two Russian submarines and sends one as a visible decoy to China while the other one creates mayhem in the U.S.My main problem with the book, other than the silly ending obviously written in after the editors wanted an upbeat finale, is that most of the book is based on hiding the existence of the marauding submarine and then having it surface on purpose so it can be caught in shallow waters. Total lunacy.On the other hand the first two thirds is a good read. Perhaps some shadow author can rewrite the last third and fix it."
1,A waste of time,"Earlier books like Nimitz class were more entertaining but this one betrays the superficiality of the author's acquaintance with naval officers, their customs and their behavior. Not wardroom material. Political asides are pathetic."
1,Totally moronic.,"If your idea of a good military read is to try to follow a writer who can't tell east from west, is unable to develop intelligent characterization or even a believable plot, and who constantly bashes anything or anybody even slightly to the left the most conservative brain-dead republican you have ever met - then this book is for you. Two thirds of the way through it I literally tore the book apart before trashing it. I simply couldn't bear the thought of someone finding it and reading the ramblings of this intellectually deficient, self-righteous fool."
2,A hopeful start of a better follow up?,"Having read all Patrick Robinson's previous ""submarine-work"" I must say that Barracuda 945 was a bit of a dissapointment to me. The errors in the book concerning the typing were a bit disturbing. The most disturbing however was Patrick Robinson's urge to give his opnion on Hollywood and former politicians and their politics in this book. Some of the comment on these former politicians was functional, yet I found there was too much of comment.The only thing I can hope for is that Barracuda 945 is a kind of an upstep to a follow up that will be just as good as Nimitz Class, HMS Unseen, etc."
1,Not as good as previous efforts,"I really enjoyed Robinson's previous novels. However, this one leaves much to be desired. The protagonist, an SAS officer, undergoes an epiphany that is quite a stretch to accept. After this he becomes a dedicated and dangerous terrorist. The action then plods along in a rather formulaic manner - interspersed by polemics against Democrats and former President Clinton. Please, Mr. Robinson, you have more talent than you've brought to this effort!Potential readers: skip this one & read his previous novels."
5,Informative and Entertaining,"While Mr. Carroll is not a doctor nor an athletic trainer - hs has a skill set that is unmatched in modern baseball. He has a network of connections in MLB that makes his online column a must-read, he is a good writer and has a tremendous knowledge of the history of sports medicine.These skills come forth in this book. It's a quick read that is accessible to fans and useful to coaches and players. The chapter on Velocity Loss shows how mindless fans like myself can see when a player is truly fatiguing on the hill.I found this book to be interesting, informative and one of the top baseball books released this year. I would love to see my favorite team apply a lot of things that Will recommends here and even try the 4-man rotation out.A great first book, Mr. Carroll, I look forward to number two."
5,Sure wish Jim Hendry would pick up a copy . . .,"This book has the potential to change the face of baseball, if only everyone would take the time to read it. The fact that so many teams still do not understand the basic principles laid forth in this book is downright sad."
1,Could Be Dangerous,A book like this could be dangerous for inexperienced pitchers. Mr. Carroll is not a physician or trainer.I strongly recommend you consult a professional if you plan on using his drills.
1,Buyer Beware,"Will Carroll is not a medical expert. He has no formal training in sports medicine.If you do read this book, please remember that."
3,Not my favorite,"This is a live album and it just doesn't have the nostalia of someof his other Christmas albums, but thanks for trying Andy and itadds a little variety to the other albums."
5,Curl up with this one,"A warm, cozy, sweet book. I read it almost cover to cover, which says so much for the selection and editing of the essays; nothing tripped me up or lost me along the way. I appreciated the inclusion of fathers and the variety of styles in general. The book managed to make me nostalgic for the toddler phase, which is hard to believe since my daughter is only four and I should still be panting with relief, but even more than that, it made me feel such tenderness for the parents, their earnestness, their candor, their ambivalence, their fierceness... what a compelling display of the capabilities of the personal essay."
5,Every new parent should read this gem,"My only regret after reading ""Toddler"" is that it wasn't in print when my son (now a teenager) was small. Reading a few of these short and wonderfully written essays every evening at bedtime, I got the warm fuzzies and was reminded of the growing pains of my own early motherhood. It's all here -- the joyful, in-your-scrapbook moments as well as the jaw-grinding frustrations of living with a tiny pre-school person.Familiar voices in the book include the likes of Louise Erdrich (""Blue Jay's Dance"") and Joyce Maynard, plus countless new writers whose contributions to ""Mommy Lit"" are worthy of anthologizing. Editor and author Jennifer Margulis has done a marvelous job of collecting stories that will appeal to all new parents, as well as older ones like me who live vicariously through the well-written chronicles of others. I've purchased additional copies of this book to give as shower gifts this spring."
5,YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!,"""Toddler"" is an absolute necessity for every parent! This book is such a gem; it was so unfortunate that I did not have the chance to read it until my son was five! Every story in this collection felt like a complete validation of all the years I spent dealing with toddlerhood. Everything I felt during those years, but was never able to say to anyone, was reflected in this collection of real stories from real parents. The ""Catholic Dad"" who reviewed this book was WAY OFF BASE. I LOVED EVERY WORD OF ""TODDLER!"""
3,"Good read, but horrible language","This book does capture a fairly diverse view of parenting toddlers, and I am really enjoying seeing myself and my friends in the stories that are aimed specifically at this crazy age group. However, I wasn't prepared for the language I found in several of the stories. If you routinely yell, ""f---"" or ""s---"" in response to your kids actions, then you might not think twice about it. I'll admit to letting ""damn"" slip out a couple of times, but I have never used some of these other words in front of anyone, especially my kids. And I agree with the previous reviewer who was a little shocked by the story where the mom is thinking of graphic sexual phrases in response to a teacher's comment about her preschooler. ""Shame, shame,"" indeed. Overall, this an okay read if you can get past some of it's shortcomings."
5,Good,"The Dvd quality of this game was extremely good. Great sound, and the picture was good on my HD TV. The service from Amazon was delivered with great packaging and was shipped to my house before the estimated due date. What great service. Thanks again Amazon for great service."
5,Essential reading regarding mistreatment of Native Americans,"Helen Hunt Jackson was a pioneer in the movement by ""palefaces of conscience"" for more humane treatment of the American ""Indian"". She (through her writings) was responsible for elimination of the worst abuses by the US Army and the Indian Bureau. This book (the capstone of her research) outlines the findings she made the original wording of treaties with various tribes and how the whites, not the Native Americans, had been the ones to abrogate the treaties.Anyone interested in justice for Native peoples needs to read this book. I found it hard to obtain through the library systems in the Philadelphia, PA area (and we have some of the best available). I highly recommend this for any citizen who considers themself informed."
4,"Came with a small stain, but besides that it's fine","The only problem is that the fitted sheet came with a small purple stain that was about the size of a a dime. Besides that, it's fine"
5,Why say why?,"This book is full of explanations and origins to over 600 words and phrases used in modern English. Unlike many books that examine the origins of words, this book is easy to read and is highly entertaining. Anyone who enjoys trivia will love this and even for those who don't, it's an enjoyable read nonetheless."
3,Fun and Interesting Read,"Have you ever wondered how certain words or phrases came to be?Like Whippersnapper, and Rain Cats and Dogs?Well you should check-out Webb Garrison's book, ""Why You SAY IT"" It shares the stories of over 600 everyday words and phrases. It is interesting, and kind of fun to read all the origins of things. I enjoyed seeing the everyday phrases that I use often, and to find out how they actually came about it. Some were funny, some were weird, and some just didn't make any sense. If you are a word person or into origins of phrases and things of that nature. This book is for you. It is laid out in different chapters which were kind of random to me. I would have like to just see all the words alphabetically listed, and all the phrases alphabetically listed throughout the book. You are able to search the index to find certain words or phrases if you don't want to read the entire book or are looking for something specific. It overall was a fun read."
4,Why Do We Say....,"Like many people, I love little bits of trivia, so this book was right up my ally. The author filled the book with the history/explanations of 600 words and phrases used in everyday life. If you're like me, you have no idea where some of these came from!This is one of those great books that you can pick up, read about something and then put it down and come back for more later! I love those kinds of books when life gets super busy. I kept this in the car for ages. Then, on those days, when I got to the boys' school early, I could keep myself entertained while learning about where things came from!If you're a ""too busy to read"" type of person or if you're just a word geek, this book is certainly one that you'll want to pick up."
4,Fairly Good book,"I used this book for my first course in Hydraulics and thought this book was pretty good. The material is organized well and the chapters get right to the point, I thaught one improvement that could be made would be to put more examples in the text."
4,"Overall, a very good and versatile design, of high quality and a great price.","I bought two of these, one red and one blue, for my wife and I traveling to the Philippines. I don't like to have to lug bags around, especially when we are going to be on and off planes, buses, taxis, jeepneys, multi-cabs, boats, etc in our travels.These bags are very good because they have backpack straps, and wheels. When fully packed they do make quite a big load on your back with the straps... but they work. Also, you can take the two parts apart and each has straps, so you can use part as a daypack as well.Overall, a very good and versatile design, of high quality and a great price."
3,CUTE AND COLLECTABLE,I purchased this item for my wife who collects tea pots; I made big points with her for a birthday present!
5,Truly is adorable,"This frog teapot arrived beautifully and truly is adorable. If you love frog collectibles, this is a winner."
4,My 3 year old loves it...,"What a fun little table for my 3 year old, as well as for my day care kids. I have a in home day care and it's the first thing the kids run to when they come through my door. Boys, girls, 12 month olds, 4 year olds it doesn't matter. They'll stand there back and forth during the day playing on the table with the trains and cars that I've provided. The train that comes with the table is cheap, my son literally broke the connector within 20 mins of normal play. After a week the train was completely useless. Save yourself the crying and headache and buy extra or back up trains. It was easy to assemble the soild pieces. The pain was putting on the stickers, what a hassle. Too bad they couldn't do that part in the factory. It took me and my hubby working together around 15-20 minutes to put it all together, not bad. It's worth the investment!"
5,My grandson loves it!,"Got it for real cheap, had to put together. Took about 25 min but quality.Happy I got a deal on this."
4,"great but, there's a catch...","This train table is awesome but, it does NOT come with as many play items as it says.. they count each and every decal and extra track piece.. you really only get THREE.. yes just THREE play pieces with this.. not anything that would keep me from buying it all over again but, i hate it when they lie to you!"
4,Fun for all ages!,"Very fun and durable toy. My two year old and seven year old both play with it. The flat surface is also a good play area. Very easy to put together and very sturdy! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has kids that like cars, trains, helicopters and/or soldiers (makes a great battlefield). Just something to keep in mind-only narrow cars and trains will fit. So buy the table first and find a car that fits and THEN go to the store to buy the vehicles and trains(most mathcbox cars do fit). Enjoy!"
5,Great Buy,"Santa brought our 2 1/2 yr old son this train table. He LOVES it! The first thing he says when he wakes up in the morning is ""I wanna play with my train table""! In fact this is the first thing he says when we leave the house and when I pick him up from daycare! He spends all evening playing with his trains and cars. I was happy to see that most of his Thomas Trains work with this table too. As for durability, we've only had it since Christmas, but I have caught him several times sitting in the table and it has held up so far. He also keeps putting the lid on and taking it off. That has held up so far as well. He likes playing with his new blocks when the lid is on. Makes a great play table too! I have already recommended this table to others. :)"
5,Just what my grandson wanted,This is a great table for our grandson who has DS. He loves the 3D track with over and under passes. He can enjoy additional activities when the table top is in place. He is 2 years old.
3,Good not Great,We got this for my son and he was very excited to play with it. The problem for us was the tracks are not really flush at the joints so the cars don't run smooth. This is the reason we had to return. It was such an easy return with Amazon. Again I liked the concept of no loose piece but it needs more work.
5,We love this table!,My 4 yr old son pretends this table is our subdivision and loves it. It's just the right size for him and very sturdy when he gets rough. It isn't too big either. We love it.
4,Great Gift!,"My grandson loves this track, plays non stop with his cars on it....too bad a little chair didn't come with it so he can sit while using the table top...."
3,Step 2 deluxe canyon road train & track,Good purchase. The table is sturdy and easy to assemble. On one side it is a train track with grooves and scenery for cars or trains and other side for drawing on eating on or playing cards. It fit our budget. My two boys initially fought over it but now they are sharing
3,Fun for kids,We gave this to my son for Christmas. He loves cars and had played with this at a friend's house. He played with it for a little while and then moved on to other toys. This toy is fun for a few minutes a day. Make sure to put the stickers on first as this is the trickiest part of the assembly. Overall not sure if this is worth the money or the space it takes up.
2,Quite disappointed.,"I bought this for my son's birthday, and ended up giving it to him early, for easter. I had been wanting to purchase this for a year, but couldn't justify the price. Then I caught it on sale. When we recieved it, the table cover part (a piece of particle board) was broken and the stickers were folded in half ruining them. The cars and trains it comes with were Very cheapy. The tracks and the little pushpins to assemble them are very difficult to do and I had sore thumbs afterward. The legs are difficult to put on, the holes are not there, YOU have to drill them. I left them off. My son played with it for a fe minutes and then I had to keep reminding him to go play with it. He would rather play with his cars and trains on the floor or kitchen table. I returned it and Amazon gave me a quick refund. My son didn't even miss it! I have never had any problems with Step 2 products in the past, maybe I just got a dud."
1,Horrible cheap plastic junk,"I think this is the first bad review I've ever given anything. I had put the word out for the holidays my son wanted a train table and said which one he had at daycare as a suggestion. Well Santa brought this one and it is awful. The plastic is so warped I can't even get the pieces to stay together, he can pull the ""bridges"" right apart from the table, plastic screws and all. The ""train"" (train shaped plastic pieces) is already falling apart, the axles don't fit in the wheels right and they're flopping all over. It says 3+ but after seeing the other reviews I thought this would be OK for my 15 month old - it IS NOT. It's like chintzy matchbox cars. I started putting it together and decided it was an exemplary model of subpar Chinese workmanship (the pieces don't fit together but the CHINA stamp is clear on every piece!!) and will be figuring out how & where to return this ASAP."
1,Missing pieces on Christmas eve,Started to build this train table for my 2yr olds Christmas tonight (Christmas eve) all of the bridges and pieces needed to assemble the table are missing! You can imagine our disappointment- our 2yr old will not receive his train table that he has been looking forward to. Thanks amazon I guess Santa really doesn't exist.
5,Great Track,My son and daughter love this! The tracks are built in and since there is a lid toys are easily stored inside. Great buy! Very durable.
4,Great train table,My 2 year old son loves this train table. It is soo nice that the tracks can't come apart. It is also nice that most Matchbox cars and Thomas trains fit on the tracks.My only complaint is that it is not for outside use (which is the reason I bought it) and it is a fair large table to have inside.Overall though it is great durable train table!!!
5,LOVE this table!!,"We got this table for our 2 boys (4.5 and 18 mos) for the holidays and they still play with it everyday! We have it in our basement family room and use it as a snack / play-doh table with the top on. All their little trucks, trains and cars store right inside and the little one even climbs right in to play.The only minor downfall is that the bridges come off pretty easily, as our older one discovered when he decided to do a ""bridge is out -- spiderman to the rescue!"" play scenario one day. Since then, he takes them off consistantly, which caused me to worry that we would lose a bridge permanantly one day soon.To remedy this minor flaw, I simply glued the bridges in place with craft glue made for plastics. Now the table is perfect and spiderman instead rescues trains and cars that fall over the sides of the canyon walls and bridges and land in the water. :)Spiderman -- you're our hero!"
4,Hours of fun and easy to put together,"This was the ""toast"" of the Christmas tree for our three year old. It was easy to assemble and came with all components needed. It's bright and sturdy - something we were looking for since our tot is tough on toys he enjoys. His hot wheels and thomas train (wooden version) fit on the tracks as well. The lid is a great feature that pops on the set when not in use and turns into a table for art or building. The most priceless thing about it was watching my father, husband, thirty-something brother, and twelve year old son play with this set. My little one has had hours of fun with it. It didn't get a five star rating because you have to embellish the track and roads with stickers. My husband likes to do that kinda thing, so it wasn't a hardship for us. This was a great buy!"
4,My two year old loves it.,I bought this for my two year old son and he loves it. My aunt likes it so much she wants to get one for her two year old son also. This table is very versatile and fun.
5,Train & Track Table,Easy to put together. Durable with no track pieces to lose. Table cover fits nice & snug. Good toy for the little ones!!
5,My 2 year old loves it!!!,"Gave this to my son for his second birthday 3weeks ago. Couldn't have made a better purchase! He plays with it at least a couple hours a day. It easily fits the smaller Thomas trains, which was a must for us. We like the fact that the tracks do not come apart, so there is nothing for him to ""break"" on it. Would highly recommend for any little train lover!!!"
4,Better than others,"We got this for my 2 and half year old and were very happy with it. My sister got one for her daughter that has the falt op that you put the pieces together on and she had to glue it. Its nice that with this table you don't have pieces they can pick up and lose. We did recieve the table with a broken lid and it took 3 attempts before they delivered a not cracked or broken top, but each time we called the company they had no problem sending a new lid at no charge to us. Overall I am happy we went with this table."
3,ok,"The kids like the deluxe canyon road train and track table, but the table could have been a better product."
4,Beautiful but no legs!,"This is an AWESOME table, but it came with no legs! Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars. We are waiting on replacement legs from Step 2, and they were really nice about it, but make sure you open this BEFORE Christmas Eve!"
1,Came BROKEN...FEW DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS.,Terrible. Table top came snapped in half. Poorly packaged. Sent it back and then rushed to Target the next day trying to figure out what to get my boys. It was going to be their BIG present Christmas morning. Don't be a dope and wait to open the package and assemble it on christmas eve.
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this Train and Track Table for my grandson's birthday. Started to put it together, when I noticed that in one area, there had to have been air pockets while the company was injecting the plastic into the mould. There were many small holes all the way through and with just one touch the plastic would break through to the next hole. There was also a track that would not lay flush due to it being too large for the span. It was at the bottom of a hill where the car would pick up speed and then come to a sudden stop not being able to go over the track. Amazon was terrific in the return process and (hopefully I won't be sorry) sending out of a replacement. I am hoping this bad one was just a fluke and the replacement table will be fine. It is great working with Amazon though!"
5,Great fun!!,"We got this for our 2 year old son for Christmas (along with some Hot Wheels to go with it). He loves driving his cars around the ramps and over the bridges. The surprising part to us is that his older sisters (ages 8,6, & 4) also love playing with it. Imaginative play abounds! The lid that goes on to create a table/workspace is also a nice feature, although it is a bit too heavy for my 2 year old to put on & take off easily. Overall, this toy has been a big hit around our house."
2,excaliber,"good:the metal and aesthetics are lovelybad:the ink cartridge is lousy!ink does not flow smooth.I changed it out for the pilot rt gel ink x-fine point.It fitperfectly and is a better ,smoother writing system.would buy more ,but oem catridge poor."
5,Still perfect after all these years...,"I first read this book when I was in Junior High School. During the intervening 40 years I have carried it from place to place in my library without giving it a second thought. On a whim I picked it up last week and decided to see what was there.Wow! I'm sorry I didn't get more out of it when I was young. Fortunately much of what Mr. Adler writes is what I have discovered about reading, but I never articulated it. And now that he has, I can approach reading in a much more methodical way.I was startled to discover that there is now a new edition with Charles Van Doren listed as the first author. I am hard-pressed to imagine what he might have done to improve upon the perfection of the original. It is very entertainingly written with a very personal flavor that I really appreciate.I found it either discouraging or encouraging to read his diatribe against the American education system, realizing that he wrote it in 1939.(My copy was printed in 1960.)"
3,Intelligent and helpful but way too verbose,"The book contains a lot of very good advice on how to extract the most value out of reading a book, how to suck it dry as it were -- very good stuff. It is defintely worth reading, but there's one flaw (that's part of everything I read of Adler): his writing is extremely verbose. You will be constantly tempted to skip forward. An abridgement would be quite useful, I think -- something the size of Strunk & White, in paperback.Bottom line: should you read this book? I'm going to say yes, but be prepared to fast-forward a lot (and not feel guilty: it _is_ wordy and pompous)."
1,Can't Figure It Out,i bought 'how to read a book' because i have many books at home and can't figure out how to work the darn things.i thought this book would help... but it's just another book.... like the other books! how can i read this book if i don't know how to read a book! i am going around in circles here... maybe there is an audio version of this?
1,Couldn't read it,"Why would anyone write a book on how to read?? i bought it hoping to learn how to read but what they don't tell you is that you have to read to find out, GRR! I DEMAND A REFUND!!!!!"
1,What's the point?,"This is the perfect example of a self-defeating product. If a person does not know how to read, how can that person possibly get anything out of this book? On the other hand, if a person does know how to read, what is the point of reading about how to read?"
5,Worth reading,"The author makes many good points about reading skillfully, including how to determine if you should bother reading a particular book.The main point is that different books should be read differently. If you agree with that premise, this book will train you how to do it. If, on the other hand, you read the USA Today the same way you would read the Communist Manifesto or a technical journal, then you may have no use for the book.Unfortunately, Adler is a little wordy at times, but the book contains instructions on how to deal with verbose authors too!"
5,Must Become a High School Pre-requisite,"While this book assumes the reader knows how to read, this book also teaches the reader to read each category of reading material: books, newspapers and magazines, with specific questions in mind.And the most important thing that I have gained from reading this book was how important it is not to read books in a hurry, but to read, as you have a conversation with the author. Expect more from the authur. And reread each book, to draw out more of yourself.This book also helped me to publish my first articles, as a Journalist - my proudest identification.I suggest that every parent, and teacher encourage high school students to read this book, before completion of high school. And to read it not just once, but at least 3 times. This is what will impress upon them how to get the most out of their lives, and be productive people."
3,Good Strategies for Reading,"I hate to say this, but I think maybe I found this book too late. I majored in English as an undergrad, and had learned most of these strategies the hard way. I really was excited about this book and wanted to get into it, but I found myself employing the book's strategies while reading the book. I skimmed, I skipped sections that struck me as repetitive, and critically analyzed the book as I went along."
3,Book review,"The book necessitates concentration. It also demands multiple readings in order for the reader to get past the dense language. It can be a better book. The book needs illustrations. The book could benefit from illustrations of the following concepts: a term, good and bad propositions, good and bad premises, good and bad conclusions, good and bad arguments, and examples of inductive and deductive reasoning. Without these concepts, the reader has to go to extra-textual sources to understand the concepts. Of course, some would argue that these concepts are elementary. Maybe so. But this book could have used an index to clarify and expand on those concepts."
5,Opened my eyes to reading as I had not known,"Young and old alike should read this. At worst you lose some time and gain knowledge but most likely you will be re-inspired to take on the Great Books of The Western World. Life is short, read fast."
5,Totally Recommend!,"This book is very helpful in understanding and applying intelligent reading. Most people do not understand active reading, or how to handle certain books on certain subjects. Overall this is a very practical book that will enhance your overall reading experience."
4,From a cerious bookworm,I recieved this book from treasurehopper in acceptable condition. I was glad to have recieved a detailed note with the book explaining the condition of the book and how to contact the seller should I need too. I would continue ordering from this seller. I recieved this book very fast and in time to read with my homework textbooks. Thanks!
4,book,"i bought this book to use at my job. i teach middle school reading. another book recommended this and even though it is older, it is a good teaching tool."
5,A must read! Wish I had read it sooner,"After reading this book, I can honestly say that I didn't know very much about reading, and I am a straight A student about to graduate college. This book is amazing for anyone looking to read at a higher level and actually retain what they are reading. It covers almost all the main genre of books. I can't praise this book enough and if you have any inkling to read it, please do!"
3,Good but too long,"Book is good, i has some good advices, but its way too long and wordy, a bit boring and maybe a bit outdated..."
4,Useful Information,I bought this bood based on a recommendation for a friend who was having trouble with comprehension of college level reading materials. He said it has helped.
4,Syntopicon,"Just thought people would be interested in some information on the Syntopicon mentioned in an earlier review. The full title is ""The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon"", and was part of the ""Great Books and Great Ideas Series"" published by Britannica. Use a used book search engine such as ABE books to find copies. They sell for around $15. Apologies if this was innapropriate."
2,Dated; too detailed,"This book had good info, thoughtful info, about how to read a book systematically. Useful primarily for scientific and non-fiction reading. Writing is dated and far too detailed for most readers. This reads like a college text on How to Read in Order to Write an Analysis for Your Professor. I got more useful (and shorter) suggestions from the Internet--and didn't have to read 400 pages!"
5,better than school?,"If you want to learn how to read well, this is a good start. You might think it's absurd for a literate person not to be able to read well, but this book is filled with insights that, although they are all common sense, they are the type of common sense we tend to overlook. If you think many books are too difficult for you, this book will explain that that is exactly why you must read it. If you want to learn how to form your own opinions on important works of literature in any field, this book teaches you the art of critique. However, I applaud this book not only because it is good instruction for those who want to become better readers. It also explains *why* we must become better readers. The person who wants to read for ""understanding,"" and not just ""knowledge"" or ""enjoyment,"" will appreciate this book."
4,Changed My Life,"I know that the title of this review may seem over the top but this little work has in fact changed my life. A friend of mine recommended this book during my first year of college. I had been struggling through my literature and history classes, bogged down with reading. In the book Mr. Adler taught me what it means to really read and listen and to extract meaning from a work. I have applied my reading skills not only to books but also my relationships. My GPA rose a full point after reading this and my critical listening skills were greatly enhanced. The book may seem a bit dry at first but it is well worth reading. Every high school student should have a copy."
5,"If you like to learn, you'll love this book.","I originally bought a copy of this book in a used bookstore because the title amused me. When I began reading it, I realized I had made a real find. This book teaches the reader how to think critically about a book, so that a real understanding can be gained. It outlines a series of steps that if practiced will lead to a greater understanding of a book's meaning than the methods usually taught in today's schools. I wish it hadn't taken me as long as it did to find this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to increase their ability to learn and understand any subject at all."
4,Excellent Principles. Highly Readable.,"I just finished reading Mortimer J. Adler's ""How to Read a Book."" It was enlightening, useful, and easily grasped. The principles have provided invaluable insight into some of my other reading. On the other hand, the criticism that Adler should read a book entitled ""How to Write a Book"" stands on solid ground. Adler's prose is at times flabby and overwritten. The book could easily be half it's size and still convey its message adequately. That being said, the book remains highly readable, if somewhat verbose."
2,VERY Limited in Adaption,"First of all, the photo of these speaker stands is very unrepresentative of the stands delivered. For example, take a look at the wire speaker supports at the top of the stands. They look like they are tall, and like they are highly adaptable for a variety of speakers (I even went to the manufacturers web site to TRY to get a better look at them). Unfortunately, they are only about five inches tall and can only be adjusted in-out about ONE inch. That's not a lot of room for adjustment. Too bad. If they had included two or three more of the wire speaker supports to accommodate different sizes of speakers, this product would be a four or five star rating. Just a shame. I am going to return these and try the Sanus Systems EF-SATB stands instead. Good Luck!"
5,...,"I bought this book for a class. It's very informing if you are interested in the themes of Shakespearean works. Otherwise, it's pretty boring. But it was short and in very good condition. I still don't know what I made in the class so I don't know how I did on the summary of the book I had to write but it was fairly easy to understand."
2,Gardena Spray Wands,What a disappointment. Have owned this product previously and it worked fine. This version leaks and is generally sub-standard.
2,Misleading title; average vocal quality,"A misleading title; should be subtitled ""Modern Songs of the Civil War."" Average vocal quality and heavy on modern acoustics. Customers looking for traditional authentic music of the US Civil War can ignore this CD. Disappointing...."
1,Shades of Blue and Gray,"I will not buy a CD over the internet that I can not sample the songs first. Oh well, you lose."
2,"Great, Simple Introduction","If you are already familiar with the basic four personality types, birth order, the affect of childhood memories and love languages then this book will BORE you. However, if you are not familiar with these areas, this is a nice, INTRODUCTORY book, hence two stars instead of one. If you like reading books with lots of stories then this would be a good book for you because his points are supported by lots of stories. Personally for me, I didn't get out of it what I was looking for."
3,ok book,"The information in this book can basically be found in the author's other books. This book is an ""overlapping"" book. Save your money and go with his other prominent books."
4,humorous perspective on life and relationships,"I only saw a portion of this movie toward the end of it and only ""caught"" a portion of the title, ""Strangers"" but was humorously entertained to watch the interaction of the humor among these ladies who are making the best of a bad situation and surviving. I think I watched this on ""Sundance"" TV channel, a great support for independent films, which I wish we had more of (I do not have a TV satellite dish, so I found this movie on a friend's TV). Great perspective on what life is about and what we are about when we have to be resourceful and compatible. If it were not for IMDB (International Movies Database), I probably would not have found this wonderful film. I will try to rent it soon at the video store and watch it completely. Yes, it may be considered more of a woman's movie, but I think a man could appreciate the humanistic aspect and the humor. I laughed as much with it as I do when I watch TV's and Red Foxx's ""Sanford and Son."""
5,A must for everyone's home library.,"It has been so long since I first saw 'Strangers...', yet I can still feel the warmth and compassion that I experienced with these wonderful characters. They are a part of all in us. Please, make it available soon!"
1,Rip-off!,"As a Ghost Hunters fan I loved the First Season Dvd. This ""Best of Ghost Hunters"" Dvd was just recycling previous (inconclusive for the most part!) shows - certainly not anything new or exciting at all. The previously deleted footage should have stayed that way! Don't waste your money on this Dvd. Buy the First Season and look for the Penitentiary and the Lighthouse episodes."
2,Dissapointing!,"Foremost, the episodes that they picked weren't all good (certainly not the ""The Very Best.."").Second, the general editing was poorly done. Third, the extra footage featuring parts of interviews previously cut out, should have never been put back in. The footage was boring and a waste of time. All, I can say is this tape is dissapointing. Don't bother to buy it."
2,I agree...it's disappointing.,"This DVD is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show. For a ""best of"" volume, I expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the DVD case advertises, namely ""the best of"" and the ""scariest moments."" In my opinion, this volume fails to deliver what it promises. I am definitely a fan of the series, and I know there are much better moments it has to offer. About the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this DVD are some fairly decent examples of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). Even though the DVD is fairly inexpensive, I don't think it's worth the cost."
3,Not really the VERY best,"I love Ghost Hunters, so no episode is a bad episode to me, but I think the title of this DVD is a little off track. During Season one there were other shows which were far more interesting than the few that are included here. The DVD is also poorly edited, lending to large gaps of nothing inserted where the commercials would have been. If you really want the best of Ghost Hunters I suggest you invest in the complete first season. Jason and Grant ROCK! Unfortunately, this DVD does not."
2,WASTE of money!,"I can only agree with the previous reviewers that these ""Best Of..."" DVDs are nothing more than randomly selected and ultimately uninteresting segments (FAR from being the best). They even contain the bleeps and commercial fade-outs and recaps.The bonus interview was a flat dud and the ""deleted"" scenes were simply longer re-takes and raw footage of stuff you've already seen in the episode. Cutting-room floor stuff, nothing at all worth looking at or listening to.Do not waste you money! Just buy the complete season(s) and you'll come out much farther ahead.Couldn't give it zero stars, so I gave it one star for Grant and one for Brian."
1,The Best For Sure!,"These guy's are the best I've ever seen. If you can handle the truth, then this DVD is for you. They don't say every little thing that happens is real. They check every detail. I give this set a five star rating."
2,"Never again, supermoviedeals","lost package, slow delivery, unhelpful customer service, i received the book over a month after they said they shipped it. i live in chicago an hour drive from where they shipped it in indiana. what i imagine happens, based on the extravagantly long period they give themselves to ship it, is they claim to have items in stock when they don't, use your money to order them and send them along when they get in. if i had known it would take this long, i would have paid more for a different seller. book was fine."
3,OK But..,".... it only gets 3 stars because it is missing the essential Crests' first - ""My Juanita"" from 1958."
1,Not working as advertised ...,"I bought this to use as one of my ""backup"" fire starters (matches and a lighter being the other two of three).I used cigarette lighter fluid and did as instructed on the paper provided.I got maybe six or seven lights out of it.Not really worth the money."
1,Too good to be true,"I ordered three of these, two for myself as an additional way to make fire while camping, and one as a gift. Product doesnt work like it should, it takes about 10 strikes to get one flame, and on the FIRST day of my camping trip i broke both flint strikers. I wasnt pushing hard at all. I feel bad giving this as a gift now, you have to handle it extremely gently or else it will snap."
1,the worst thing for camping I ever bought,This device if purchased should be used very carefully if not IT WILL BREAK it is very delicate and I don't advise buying it if you have any upper body strength at all and thats coming from a 130 lbs weakling.
1,Don't Count on it!,"I have purchased several of these from various vendors, but this one was the worst. I never was able to get it to spark enough to create a flame, and the casing fell off after about a week. I still have them sitting in the tackel box, because at the very least the do hold the lighter fluid that I put into it."
3,Permanent Match for Survival,It works as described and the price for the item is fair. It's a shame the shipping was so expensive.

4,not your typical hindi movie ...,"I'll keep this short.Its good. Not the best movie ever, but definitely worth the rental."
2,disappointed,I have purchased many Gardena products. I was disappointed in this sprayer because it leaked the first time I used it. There did not seem to be any adjustment where it did not leak. Also it is not ergomonic. The four trigger sprayer is much better and not so heavy.
2,Poor Design from a normally excellent company,"I have a ton of Gardena stuff, and this is by far the worst of the lot. I have two of the Nozzles and over time both have developed leaks that can not be stopped. It appears to be internal to the pattern selection. Note: I've had both Nozzles less then Six months - They replace a much better Gardena nozzle that alas cracked due to freezing. I would caution all to consider a different nozzle."
2,Poor Quality,The threads on the large spray keep coming off and that is true for the other Gardenia sprayer I bought. Poor design or poor quality. I have used Gardenia products for years and I am disappointed to see the decline of quality.
1,Not worth the money,Product description led me to believe this to be a great product that would satisfy my needs for a garden spray nozzle. I was very disappointed to find it a cheaply made product that came apart the very first time I attempted to use it. The nozzle leaks and the large spray head falls off every time you run water through it.
1,Garbage Shot with a Camcorder,"There are low-budget films that succeed despite their limitations.There are those that are camp and fun because of their limitations.And then there is the unique kind of trash that has come about in the 'camcorder age' and which has absolutely nothing to recommend it.This is one such project.Shot with a cheap camcorder, directed, edited and 'acted' by people who have no cinema skills, this abomination has only one thing about it that is truly frightening:How could they get anyone to actually distribute this on DVD?I watched about 6 minutes of this on Netflix streaming, and that was more than enough.C."
5,"JBL 10"" Subwoofer E150P","This Speaker seems to be no longer manufactured. As far as I can tell by the published specs. the JBL SUB 10 is its replacement. The grill is different. My E150P is well engineered and is very pleasing to listen to.In my listening room ( 16'x12' with vaulted ceiling ) which is not set up for surround sound, the E150p really brings out a symphonic bass drum or a 32Hz organ pedal. For under $200 I believe you will be satisfied."
3,"adequate for the money, I *THINK*","Well this subwoofer has a very narrow sweet spot...turn it up too much and it resonates, turn it down too much and you can't hear it.If you don't have high expectations it'll do, and the price is certainly attractive.Still, I wish I had spent a extra two or three hundred for an SVS or Hsu or Velodyne, really good subs start at four hundred dollars and up."
2,Great for HT...not so good for music...It's all about the source...,"This sub does a good job for Home Theater in a small to medium sized room but for music it just doesn't go low enough. Would work better in a bedroom or a dorm. You'll only hear the difference if you're source is via digital coax or fiber optic cable. It does a decent job however for movies in Dolby D.Bottom line, if you want a good sub for both music and movies in a medium to large sized room. You need at least a 12"" 250 watt or better sub. I would recommend the JBL E250P instead if you really want deep bass to fill the room."
5,the girls are hot,"Feature packed interactive dvd.Peach does a nice job with multiple camera angles, I wish they still made features like this one."
5,PURE GOLD!,"I read ""All the Right Reasons"" awhile ago and loved it. When I finished the book, I wondered what happen with Toni & Chuck. Well in ""A Second Chance at Love"" I found out. Just like I hope the were made to be together. This book was just wonderful Ms. Sims not only brought us up to date with her daughters,but she share some insight on Toni & Chuck. This book will be put in the special place where I have my books that I read over and over again. If you don't have this book, go out any buy, you won't be sorry."
2,Tab is Lacking alot,"My main complaint is the Tab, Its not like Stefan Groomsman tab at all. Notes are on the line and not inbetween like Grossman and many others. There is no indication if thumb or finger should play the note. No hammer on or pull off indications either. There is also no Tab explanation like Grossman has in his DvDs. Most Songs have been covered in other Dvds by other more competent Teachers. Teachers who can anticipate where students may have issues, such as incomplete or lacking tab."
5,5 Star Teaching,"Although not familiar with the instructor, I found his teaching to be straight forward, easy to follow, and clear. Being a gifted musician does not necessarily mean a gifted teacher, yet here we have both, the player and the teacher. He breaks down the parts of the song carefully and slowly, and his performance to open the song is inspiring to the student. Although this is a Level two to Level three teaching, (meaning advanced beginner to intermediate level) advanced intermediates will also enjoy making the beautiful and recognizable Mississippi John Hurt thumb style polished completions. Excellent teacher, well chosen songs (my favorites include ""Mary, Don't You Weep"" and ""Blessed Be the Name""), solid camera work all come together for a must DVD for fans of fingerpicking, Mississippi John Hurt, and country gospel music. I look forward to future teaching DVDs from Tom Feldman. His low key approach is helpful and enjoyable."
3,It's ok...not our favorite but not terrible,"I bought this flavor because of the reviews on it. It's just sorta...bland. I expected something called Jambalaya to be a little spicier, a little more OOOMPH to it. This was sorta like a flavored mac and cheese with hamburger in it, once made up. It wasn't bad, it was ok, but it just wasn't as New Orleans as I'd liked. And we're not talking HOT-spicy, we're talking just SPICE-spicy. I bought a case of it, so we'll be eating it for a while, but we will definitely be putting some seasonings in it to make it more Cajun-tasting. I think that Hamburger Helper might have been a little timid about giving this a little spice, because many people don't tolerate zesty food very well. I say if they don't like spicy, why order anything remotely Cajun? LOL Bottom line: you may find it just fine, it may become your favorite variety, but it's just our point of view that it, like many other Hamburger Helper mixes, needs a little HELP. :)"
1,A travesty...,"I would rate this a zero if that were an option. This CD is a travesty in the truest sense of the word. This is advertised as greatest hits of Webber's music, but there is nothing of the original feeling of Webber's music on this CD. Though they may have talent for other music, the makers of this CD totally miss the mark in translating Webber's music. Selection #4 is a particular mockery with its techno-translation of the piece. There are many other options available with quality recordings of Webber's music. Do not buy this CD!!!"
5,Great British recipes.,If you want to learn how to cook traditional British recipes and want the recipes to be simple. Then this is the book for you.
5,"Nice and thick, good quality blanket",This product is good quality and is nice and thick. It also feels luxurious. It keeps my baby warm and not overheated. My baby sleeps well in it in the car even during this winter season.
5,Perfect pink blanket,Great baby blanket. Love color- beautiful pink. Blanket is larger than most which works perfectly for my toddler. Highly recommend.
4,"nice blanket, almost brown","Blanket is very nice. It came quickly. It looked more like an off-white in the picture, but is more like a light brown in real life- a perfect color for blanket that a toddler drags around."
1,Big disappointment,I eagerly awaited Southern Style's release ll/l only to find that the content was repeated from past issues of Southern Accents. I was looking forward to new pictures/content but found very little that wasn't in old magazines. I think the editors could have at least given us different camera shots of those same rooms. Big disappointment.
2,Not what I thought the book was,"I was purchasing home plan books and this item popped up as a ""you might also like"" item. So I received it but was disappointed there were no plans just decorating/style ideas. It was not what I was looking for."
4,Poetry in Action,"I liked the easy going, almost poetic tempo of ""I'll Paint the Sun."" It was a nice contrast to Al Garrrotto's other suspense stories.The story of Libby and Painter reads like an adult fairy tale. The writing is clean with beautiful descriptive phrases.Thanks for writing ""I'll Paint the Sun."""
5,This and All in the Series,"This is more than ""memory lane"" but a series that has children learning right from wrong and to accept responsibility for their actions not to mention learning from mistakes. You will even find them doing things they are responsible for before continuing their sleuthing (prioritizing). The stories end in the '60's, not '50's (yet, they are timeless). The titles are ""safe"" to give children / grandchildren unlike some so called modern children's titles out there that have crass content, at best, but are not previewed by parents / grandparents. The Happy Hollister's series are stories that contain good character examples with children learning to work for things and not just expect things without personal and honest effort. They also exhibit self sacrifice for the benefit of others. I am glad that the titles are being reprinted without editing to include Kindle versions by the late author's family."
5,A series of books that the whole family will enjoy.,"I read the Happy Hollister series when I was in elementary school, they were my companions. I couldn't wait to go to the library each time to check a new book out. This is a great series for the entire family. I would love to find the entire series of books so that my four children can read them."
4,A Fun Mystery,"I love the Jacqueline Kirby mysteries by Peters. In the case of ""Naked Once More,"" it's a serious mystery, but also has fun skewering the tropes of the romance and mystery genres."
5,Naked Once More,Love this book - It pulls you in right from the first word and keeps you reading right to the enexpected end. Hated to put it down. Read it more then once.
1,This Mower worthless,"You have to have a flat lot, and not many trees in there for Friendly Robo... to work. It will get stuck right by the trees, and if it rained, then you cannot use it because it gets stuck. It can not cut tall grass, and leaves some grass here and there. The worst part is the service. Mine had problem the second week, and when I called the tech. the only way he would look at it is for me to ship it to them. That is 80 to 100 dollars in shipment, and he didn't know how long it will take. You are dealing with Middle Eastern company, so don't expect good customer service."
2,Beginners???,"This book is not for any ""beginners"". It is my best guess that this book is not a starting point."
1,This is Eclesiastical Latin! Not Classical!,"Needing a review of the latin I learned in College, I purchased this slim volume ot do some revision. It claims to be both Classical and Medieval, but I could not really find much classical latin inside except some scant quotes that they throw at you which you can't read even after you complete this book!! There seems to be some religious bias here, too. The readings are about some monks somewhere in Europe, and most of the dialogue makes fun of the classical `pagans`.Then, using it solely as a grammer review, I quickly noticed there were almost no examples of the grammer.Don't waste your money on this book. Learn it properly. Anyone who wants a fun introduction to latin I suggest Cambridge Latin Course or Oxford's Latin; far and above this book."
4,Best for those who have already studied Latin,This is a beginner's book only for those with unusual competence in learning languages. Those who don't may well find the pace extremely fast. Peter V Jones Learn Latin or even Latin for Dummies will probably be better texts for those who open the book without any Latin.
5,The Easiest Way to Learn Latin Around,"I have bought many different Latin books, including the Complete Idiot's Guide, Latin Grammar, and Cambridge Latin Course. When I first encountered this text, I was skeptical. I opened it and saw a mule and a monk in the woods, which did not help my first impression of the program. But I went through the first unit, and I was amazed at how I understood and comprehended what the book was saying. After purchasing Beginner's Latin, I began to master concepts that I had thought above my understanding. I would recommend this book to a five year old and a fifty year old, confident they could both learn Latin. Veni, vidi, vici Latinam!"
3,Not A Great Tool For Beginners,"I am definitely a beginner when it comes to the Latinlanguage... When I sat down and read Beginner's Latin I thought it wasokay. The book isn't wrong with any of the infromation in it, but in the end I recieved little help from it. If you are just starting to learn the very difficult Latin language, search for help elsewhere than this particular title."
1,Boring Baldassare's Book,"An awful, boring book. One of the most dreadful things I have ever been forced to read."
1,A lengthly rehash of magazine articles on global warming,"The book is all politically correct text with little technical data.The author details how the oil and coal companies derailed efforts to reduce fossil fuel use in the U.S. He claims surprisingly low costs for wind and solar power, but doesn't show why investors, from concerned environmentalists to ""greedy"" oil companies, fail to seize a profitable opportunity.Although the failure of the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the authors main theme, he does note that the real threat is fossil fuel burning in third world countries.The author barely acknowledges the existence of nuclear power, and avoids any suggestion that the world's 500 nuclear plants, still growing outside the U.S.,reduce the warming problem"
1,The author Gelbspan has no understanding of climate change.,"And so the main thrust of his approach is ad hominem attacks. As a professional climatologist with more than 30 years experience (and not mentioned in this book, so I have no stake in it), I would rate this book as total trash and urge that no one read it.The book deserves a zero star rating."
5,King Albert with a Classic Stax Session,"This is a great session from one of the most underrated of the bluesmen. Albert King influenced many of the great modern rock/blues guitarists, such as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, yet his own legacy remains largely unrecognized. The big man with the Flying V provides a concise, sharply executed set here. The band he fronts is up to the task, contributing nicely done organ, piano, sax, and trumpet fills behind King Albert. King was a notorious perfectionist in the studio, so he must have been pleased with the efforts from these musicians. Standout tracks include the wonderful title cut, ""Firing Line"", and ""You Gotta Sacrifice"". An excellent version of ""The Sky is Crying"" is probably the strongest piece on this solid set. A must have for blues lovers."
2,Not that Great,"I'm actually somewhat disappointed because I heard a lot of good stuff about Glen Plake but his videos are just not that entertaining compared to Warren Miller's stuff. The action sequences are just not that exciting. I bought this set because I was not able to get Fistful of Moguls by itself and sure enough, that was the only good dvd out of the four. The other 3 were just really boring and I just wished it was over. This is coming from a former ski instructor and an avid ski bum. If you can get Fistful of Moguls by itself, just get that."
4,"good condition, just as advertised.",I received the book a lot faster than i had suspected and it was in very good condition. There is only minor wear on the plastic cover but the inside pages are perfect. I like shopping here and recommend it to anyone.
5,NICE collection of drawings,"A nice well printed collection of drawings, some nudity though so stay away if that offends."
3,Nice Examples of Illustrations,"I haven't looked through Frank Cho's comic books enough to really say if I like them or not, but I have seen examples of his work here and there and decided a book focusing on anatomy would be useful to me. (since that is a weak point in my art) I was somewhat disappointed when I received the book to find out that it contained only black and white illustrations. The beautiful cover is the only color throughout the book as well as the only painting. The best part I found were the comparisons between original graphite drawings and more finalized inks of some illustrations, there just were not enough like that.Basically, it's nice, but I'd like to see more color and more mediums."
5,Beautiful work,"Frank Cho is a master. Some might only look at has work as a group of ""pretty pictures of pretty women"", but it is much more than that. This book gives you a good look at Frank's finished work and some of his sketches. He is a master at drawing the female form.If you are an artist, you'll be able to appreciate his understanding of anatomy. His drawings use unique proportions (especially in the hips and legs). The surface anatomy correctly indicates the structure beneath it. The way he draws a knee amazes me. No, I'm not a sicko. Knees are amoung the most neglected and most difficult body parts to draw. The simple joint has a number of tendons, bones, and muscles that continually shift based on the angle and distribution of weight.This is a glorious example of a master's work. I give it my highest rating and can't wait for his next book to come out."
3,Just okay,The cover is a bit misleading as the inside illustrations are all in black and white. The fantasy settings of all the models is a bit distracting.
1,Nothing pans out!,There is no correlation between the price of an item and its true value. This book is an obvious example. It is the most expensive book on trading I have ever bought. When I researche the techniques described in the book EVERT ONE failed to live up to its hype. Caveat Emptor!! Do ourself a favor and prevent having to return this book since it certainly does not live up to its hype. Buy a set of Larry Williams books instead. You will learn much more about markets and you will net save money.
3,A few patterns hold up to historical testing,"Be skeptical of books with large print and a small number of pages. Traders love to see simple patterns for easy entry, but the fact is that most of these strategies don't hold up to scrutiny under backtesting."
1,Street Smarts,This book at first read- reads as if it was written by gradeschoolers. The format is unprofessional. The chart patterns referred to are rare patterns. The cost of this book is extremely high given the unprofessional presentation and content.
2,Hopelessly inadequate explainations; radiculously brief,"The authors of Street smarts may be expert traders and must be excellent in the art of making money ( you can tell from the price of the book!), but are hopelessly choppy teachers. Either they have not re-read what they have written, or they truly do not want to disclose their secrets in a step-by-step way. The looks of the book are as if everything is explained step-by-step. There are great diagrams and the steps are numbered 1,2,3 etc. But there are such big gaps in their explanations. In every single method they have written, the explanations are so ridiculously brief and so hopelessly inadequate that it is bound to leave a reader very frustrated and angry for spending such a lot of money on such a choppy book."
1,This book is not wirth the money,"THe book is a promotional trick ,where only few books are printed in order to look like this is in such a demand.If the author knew anything about making money, it will not sell it to you - just so you are clear on this.THe author does not present any results of her testing of strategies.So keep spending money on her books and seminars...."
1,Who gave woman a free pass?,"I am aficionado of good books on technical analysis and this is certainly not a good one! Many of the techniques described in this book were invented by me as well many years before this book was published. Subseqeuntly, I discarded them into my recyclcle bin as worthless. I am not even a full time investor, devoting a good share of my time to real estate. I am just surprised that people are gullible enough to accept this tripe. This expensive book, expensive seminars, expensive internet service. What is this huckster going to come up with next. Perhaps she has gotten away with this sham because she is a female in a predominanatly male business. I too am involved in the national technicans group and I am embarrassed to be associated with such ilk. I have much to contribute to this industry and look forward to doing so in the future. In the meantime, I can only hope these market charlatans mend their ways."
1,It is not what you think it is!,There are other more informative books out there costing definitely less....!
4,"Good read, but expensive",I found this book to be very insightful in spotting possible setups on a chart. The downfall is that it's very expensive. I got mine via digital delivery on Ebay for $49. The techniques must be followed exactly in order for you to profit from them. And remember to use stops...only a fool trades without using stops.
4,How about a real book on trading,"When I say real, I mean Linda is proven and she is sharing a number of effective strategies here with a minimum of math jargon. This is definitely a trading book that gives you the layman's approach to successful trading."
1,Overpriced,"These authors are obviously writing books for the pure sake of making money. i mean every writer should earn $ for their time and efforts putting materials together into a book, but there are some authors like Laurence A. Connors & the Michael something guy (who has a booklet selling for $100) publish books just for making money, their intention of writing isn't to share ideas or discuss subject matters, they just wanna write something and sell at some expensive prices.Why the heck books like this would sell for so much?"
1,Horrible Bag Don't Waste Your money!!!!,This diaper bag is made of cheap plastic. For the money I felt that it should have lasted more than THREE WEEKS. Two hooks snapped off. The main material of the bag ripped. I am not wasted any more time on this bag buy anything else!!!
3,attached with Velcro,"Seems well constructed, but I am not a fan of the cover being attached with Velcro. I think this is so you can swap covers, but snaps might have been a better choice as I can see this Velcro business being annoying. There is a lot of Velcro and it is quite sticky making opening the bag one handed potentially tricky."
4,Durable baby bag,"Great bag for baby and parent. Very durable, easy to clean and has a look that dad doesn't mind carrying. All in all very satisfied with this purchase"
4,Cute and functional,"I love this bag. It looks nicer than a standard diaper bag due to its messenger bag appearance. While my husband wasn't sure about the pink color, he loves the style.BEST FEATURE: The top of the pink flap connects to the bag by velcro, making it easy to access into the main compartment of the bag when in a rush.WORST FEATURE: While having the side zipper access to the bottle compartments is nice, I do wish the bottle compartments were enclosed and padded to keep milk cold. I think they are not to give more room inside the main compartment if the bottle compartments are not being used. So, it just depends on what is more important to you, enclosed bottle compartments or more room in the main compartment. It could use another zippered compartment in the main compartment like it has on the pink flap and on the back where the changing pad is."
4,Excellent Book,This book details the effort that Lincoln put into his Cooper Union speech. This speech propelled him into the position of Republican Party nominee for President in 1860 and ultimately into the White House. The book also makes clear that Lincoln actively sought the nomination for President and did not just beome his party's nominee for President by accident.
2,Way too little about the speech,"I do not know what book all these 5 star reviews belong to. The Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President book that I read had surprisingly little about the speech itself. The brief part about the speech was very good. If the rest of the book was like that, this would be another 5 star review. But, since it wasn't, 2 stars is the best I can give it."
5,"""The Founding Fathers said . . .""","For anyone who wants to use the founding fathers as a justification for their belief system should read this speech and this book.Lincoln in tight, careful reasoning lays out exactly what the founding fathers believed in regard to slavery. Eloquent, exciting and challenging.This is much needed study to the speeches of Lincoln."
3,"Good, but not great","With the variety in this pack, these blades should meet most needs. Each blade is labeled to tell you what job to use it on. The problem is the lettering wares off quickly. I have simply set one blade aside of each type and not use it. Then I can glance at the new blades to know which blade I need. These blades do a fairly good job, but I prefer Bosch especially for cutting curves because Bosch blades are not as wide. However, they can also break easier."
1,Not very original.,This book is not a very original idea and some of the lines are the same ones repeated over and over.
3,"A good book, but not one I'd read again","When both of their parents die in close succession, Magdalene and Norah Vanstone are shocked to find themselves left with no inheritance, due to fact that their parents were not actually married at the time of their birth.""No Name"" is a good book, albeit a bit too long for my liking, but not a book that I would ever read again. Although I found it fascinating to learn of how illegitimate children were treated back in the 1800's (a topic that must have been close to Collins's heart, considering that he never married the mother of his children), this tale of a young woman's descent and torment at the hands of uncaring relatives, was just too depressing for my liking. Yes, it does have a happy ending, but having to wait over 700 pages to get to that ending wasn't much fun at all. I much preferred Collins's two, better known, works, ""The Woman in White"" and ""The Moonstone""."
4,"Another ""must read"" for Collins fans.","Before picking up this book, one must adjust their values and morals meters - suspend judgement for a the 21st century world - and be open to learning about the life and value systems of Collins' world. This author is excellent at portraying the black, white and very grey value systems of the period and how they are reflected in the characters thoughts, actions and motives. The questions of fate, god's hand, or karma all arise in this story that twists, turns, strays and sneaks up on the reader. At times ponderous and slow for the modern reader but the attraction of extreme motives and morals more then overcomes.This story is very relevant to the extreme and divergent values at great conflict in our world today - spiritual, religious, amoral, evil. Could be straight from the headlines or the pulpit or the politician today."
3,No Name,"The book was in excellent shape but the size is too big. It's difficult to read because of the size. Why would anyone print a book 8""x10""."
5,extremely interesting and entertaining,Wilkie Collins is one of my favorite authors. He combines memorable characters with twisted plots and suspensful situations. This story of two sisters disinherited by the strict Victorian laws is everything a reader could hope for.
1,No Name,"VERY disappointed in the format of this book. The unusual shape/size makes it difficult to hold and because the lines are so long it is difficult to keep focused on the correct line. Therefore, I cannot curl up or read this book in bed. Why would the publisher consider printing this book in this format??I haven't finished the book but I have enjoyed other Wilkie Collins novels. I would give it at least 4 stars but for the format."
4,Wilkie Collins- No Name,"Insightful portrait of life for women in Victorian England. Fun and wicked characters. Easy to read. A relief from a Dickens' epics, if that's your thing. Enjoyed very much."
4,"Vivid, driven story, good writing","Wilkie Collins writes a good, fast paced story. Even for today's readers, the plot is tense. Set in 19th century England, it will appeal to fans of Dickens and Austin, with drama, intrigue, unexpected twists and heartbreak. The English is clean and sharp.Not wanting to give away any of the plot, I will say only this. I found the characters complex and vivid, and the intensity of their drive or equally extreme lack of purpose, captivating, and maybe a little shocking. I was also struck by the author’s underlying premise about what was true and what was important. You can feel him stretching the principles of the society of his day, challenging them, and in the end, settling them a little differently.I highly recommend it."
2,Great book; not so great edition,"I love this book; best Wilkie Collins I've read so far. I read it on my kindle, then purchased the Seven Treasures Publications edition (9.95) to give as a gift. It is HUGE - I guess I should have realized, and they do state the dimensions. It is so unwieldy - almost as large as an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper - think phone book size! If you want an actual book instead of the kindle edition, this one is not ideal."
4,A Very Good Introduction to the Radiosity-Method,Radiosity and Global Illumination has been written by two real experts in the field of advanced computer graphics. The main focus of this book is a very readable introduction to the radiosity-method but the authors also cover most of the more advanced techniques. The book could dig a little deeper into the underlying mathematics though.
1,Not as good as it sounds.,"Alot of well known clubs are not mentioned in this book, alot of cities were left out and only high rate clubs were mentioned. I feel alot of nice establishments were left out. They were left out of the 1999 edition, so I was hoping to se them in 2000, but I didn't. Nowadays, one just need to go to the internet and get more information on clubs that was provided in this book. This was a disappointment to me."
4,Hidden Roots Review,"This is a fantastic book. I really like Bruchac's writing. The afterwords, which includes the historical details that the book is based on, is fantastic for anyone looking to teach about contempory native peoples. There is, also, lots of good information on the Abenaki's, which is excellent for teaching about New England and some Canadian native peoples."
1,jonas brothers the journey,"I bought this dvd knowing it was unauthorized by the Jonas Brothers. That was a mistake. It is the worst thing I have ever tried to watch about them. Every where I looked it up it said it was 70 min but it is only 35 min and that was long enough. You shouldn't waste your money on this. I think any Jonas Brothers fan would be dissapointed. Its mainly just other people talking about them, with some scenes of them thrown in."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I ordered this for my teenage daughter, a huge Jonas Brothers fan. I should have been alerted by the buzz word ""Unauthorized"" as it had no input from the Jonas Brothers. It is very short and 3 of the most dedicated fans said it ""failed"", was a waste of money and an insult to ""the boys"" because they are a class act that do things right by their fans. Save your $$ for somethning good. I would have given it less then 1 star if I could have. I have no problem at all with the seller, just the movie."
2,not great,Got this for my 12 yr old son and he's been using it but i dont think he is feally impressed with it.
3,It was partly ok.,"Ok, Christopher hart is not the best in the manga business. I think this book is more for expanding your horizon of villians, not teaching you how to draw them. I have to admit though, it showed me some things I didn't think of before. It also showed that some of the harder aspects of drawing are not so hard if you break them apart. Three stars."
4,Helpful if you Already Know How to Draw Anime/Manga,"I'm a manga artist myself. I don't make them, but I do a lot of fan-based art and such.Anyway, I do a lot of evil characters. Since I've already developed a talent and a style, I just use this to perfect my villains. Books by Hart like the Fantasy one he did (helped me do dragons an' demons better. And I learned how to make gnolls ^_^) helped a lot. As did this one. Only buy if you know what you're doing. Otherwise, How To Draw Manga series is right up your alley."
4,Classic Reference,"This is a classic trading book with extensive studies of the markets during the depression. It takes a long time to work through all the material, there are other books on the market that are updated."
3,Very interesting character,"William the Conqueror is an extremely interesting character, and Heyer succeeds in bringing him to life: along with all of his complexities. Her book is a fascinating account of the life of William and I especially found it interesting to learn about his military stratergies. He seemed to be very ahead of his time in military tactics. Heyer's account of the Battle of Hastings, 1066, is very good.However, I gave this book 3 stars as opposed for 4 because I am reviewing it as a novel, and not as a textbook. The narrative structure is a little bit non-sensical and the plot has sometimes not been developed properly as Heyer no doubt was concerned instead with the accuracy and broad spectrum of historical fact.Nevertheless, this is a good book to pick up if you care to be whisked off to the time of Saxons vs. Normams."
2,Old style written story,"This novel was difficult to get through because of the names of the numerous characters and the style of writing. This book was published in 1931 so maybe this was why it was unsmooth reading and storytelling. Although slow going, I did finish the book and I am definitely much more versed on the life of William the Conqueror. I am hoping to find more enjoyable historical fiction about William the Bastard by some more modern authors."
1,BORING,"I bought this based on the great reviews, which is how I buy a lot of books I read. This wasn't one of my better choices. I know the story of William, his wife Matilda, their sons, Battle of Hastings, etc. I just found this book boring. I skipped through much of it. It never got or held my attention."
2,Very poor formatting for Kindle,"I just started reading the Kindle version and then stopped until the publisher fixes the Kindle version. On most pages there are no paragraphs, just a solid wall of text. It should be easy for the publisher to delineate the paragraphs in the Kindle version. The few pages I read were very interesting but difficult to read because of the abscence of paragraphs."
4,A colorful historical novel,"This is an entertaining, colorful historical novel based on the life of William the Conqueror, as seen from the vantage point of one of his knights. Lively, with plenty of detail, much of it accurate. There are inaccuracies, of course. (William's wife, Matilda, did not create the Bayeux Tapestry.) But all in all, a very good read that gives a good sense of 11th century Normandy and England."
3,all about William,"This books is basically a bio about William the Conqueror. If I recall correctly, I believe that a lot of research went into this so there is also a lot of fact mixed in with the fiction.While I love European history, the bulk of this was just a little too much factual illustration of the life and times to keep my interest as a novel, let alone a romance.I will say, however, that there is one unforgettable point in this story where William answers Matilda's (Williams's wife) rejection of his suit. I'm not sure exactly of the historical accuracy but it surely made this story memorable for me."
3,Film Festival Fare,"This movie played at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2001 and I happened to catch it. The plot follows a wealthy, powerful business man and the waiter he hires to become his food taster. A strange premise, but I thought, rife with possibilities. Sexual undertones are suggested and a power struggle ensues as the employer tries to involve his new employee in increasingly bizarre activites. Overall, an enjoyable movie, but definitely film festival fare. The version I saw was French with English subtitles."
3,Taste of Fear,Hitchcock would have loved this psychological thriller about a young man whose life is taken over by the wealthy businessman who hires him as his professional food taster.
2,its ok,"the previous writer was mistaken, the artunian trupet concerto was written by alexander artunian for a russian classical trumpet player decades before arturo sandOval ever performed on the trumpet. His classical playing is good but still secondary. Compared to a true classical artists his technique is rather sloppy at times. His multiple tonguing is blatty. His range and felxibility is impressive, but the overal consistency of his tone is ruined by his poor articulations. One area of classical trumpet playing arturo is up to par in is piccolo playing. If you wish to hear arturo play calssical, buy some of his picc recordings."
3,From the back of the book . . . .,"The complete handbook for every sculptor includes: Principles of design; How to carve in stone; How to carve in wood; How to carve in acrylic and foamed plastic; How to model in clay, terracotta, wax, plaster and glass fiber; A guide to casting in metals, Plaster of Paris, polyester resin, and clay; How to work in metal; How to work in plexiglass; A guide to display and transportation of sculpture works; Plus a comprehensive list of culptor's equipment and materials!"
3,Some good chapters for understanding Senior Adults,"""The Graying of the Flock"" is a good basic book about ministry models for working in the local church with Senior Adults. There are other more in-depth books on Senior Adults if one is trying to understand the role of seniors in our society and churches. The biblical understandings of seniors could be more detailed and scholarly focused, but the best chapters are the description of the new models of ministry, health models, implications of aging for the church and society, and the resource section. A very basic, yet useful tool concerning aging in America."
3,5th Ward Weebie,"I think they ablum is alright he's gotta couple of tight songs.If ur big weebie fan then I suggest u pick up this ablum he also has guess apperance from three 6,Ms Tee ,Kane & Abel,so if ur a real weebie fan pick this ablum up."
3,"good product, horrible shipping","I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT PAID EXTRA FOR 2 DAY SHIPPING, WHEN I COULD HAVE GOTTEN STANDARD FOR FREE. WE DIDN'T RECEIVE IT FOR OVER A WEEK, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME FOR STANDARD. I TRIED TO COMPLAIN TO SEVERAL PEOPLE, BUT NO ONE LISTENED, AND I WAS NOT GIVEN MY MONEY BACK FOR THE EXTRA SHIPPING."
2,Slow moving story,"Have seen many Eric Rohmer movies that I enjoyed. However, this one was rather dulland took forever to find out where it is going..... Found the filming and story tellingrather mediocre and would not recommend it."
5,Excellent movie that really sneaks up on you.,"You have to give it time, but if you do this really sneaks up on you. You keep wondering and waiting for something to happen, and it all seems so mundane, until you realize at the end that the mundane is not necessarily boring, and not necessarily shallow."
3,GOOD MOVIE..........BAD DVD,"I love this movie, so I was excited to get it on DVD. I was dissapointed. First, the image is full-screen, not matted, and it looked like I was watching a made-for-tv movie. Did Rohmer do this on film? I would assume so, but the image quality on this dvd is poor, grainy, and very faded. I would wait till the next DVD release, if there is one. The sound is okay, the subtitles are PERMANENT, so you can't remove them, and the scene access is a joke, there are only six scenes according to FoxLorber. But all in all, I think this ranks slightly above VHS (which is pathetic for a DVD), so if you want a better copy of this movie than your local video store get this!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST CD'S OF THE 90'S,"It has a swooning, tongue-in-cheek feeling about it, songs like Only Happy When it Rains and Stupid Girl are simply anthems to remember for all time. One of those cds you pop in just about every day and you never get tired of it."
5,garbage lover #1,"I CANT SPEAK ON ANYONE ELSES BEHALF, BUT AS FOR MY OWN OPINION I THINK GARBAGE IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPEND TO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. PERIOD! SHIRLEY MANSONS STRENTH AND INTELLIGENTS COMES ACROSS VERY STRONG IN HER LYRICS. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE GARBAGE FAN MYSELF. I FIND MYSELF CRAVING THIER MUSIC ON A DAILY BASIS. THIER SOUND IS SOOOO INFECTIOUS. I HAVE TURNED AVID ROCK HATERS INTO COMPLETE GARBAGE ADDICTS! AND I LOVE IT!!!! EVERY TIME THEY RELEASE A NEW ALBUM I FIND MYSELF TOTALLY INTRANSED BY SHIRLEYS VOICE. AND THEY ALWAYS LEAVE ME WANTING MORE.I SUGGEST CHECKING OUT ANGEL FISH.AN ALBUM PUT OUT BY A BAND IN WHICH SHIRLEY MANSON WAS A MEMBER BEFORE SHE WAS WITH GARBAGE."
5,"Amazing album, best of the '90s","I lovelovelove this album. I only recently got into Garbage, but I'm a hardcore fan now. I bought this album because the song ""Stroke of Luck"" caught my attention on a tv show, and I fell in love with all the songs. Every song on this album is raw, melodic, and intense. The opener, ""Supervixen"" is a tease to the rest of the album. This song is my absolute favorite, with Shirley telling the world that she will be their religion. Next up is ""Queer,"" which has a video that is to die for. Coming in third, still sure to please, is ""Only Happy When It Rains,"" which I'm sure every person who was at least 10 years old in 1995 has heard. The rest of the album has standouts like ""My Lover's Box,"" ""Not My Idea,"" ""Dog New Tricks,"" ""Vow,"" and ""Stroke of Luck."" Seriously, pick this up. You WON'T be disappointed."
5,Still great a decade later!,"Wow! I can't believe that it's been over a decade since I bought this CD. Listening to this CD now brings back all the memories of the times when I listened to it almost non-stop, which is what good music is supposed to do. This style of music was new at the time of this release and at first I remember not really liking it all that much. Of course the first two singles (Only Happy When it Rains and Stupid Girl) were all I had to go on, and they're not the best songs on the album. After I heard Supervixen and Vow I was sold and decided to buy the CD. It was a great purcahse becase all the songs really grew on me and I played this CD over and over again for months!"
5,A Whole New Religion,"This record is a trip. With all it's grinding guitar hooks and polished electronic effects it sounds like a grungy-goth daydream. Behind all the sonic show-offery are extremly catchy, very well written songs that are dark and a lot of fun at the same time. Take all this into consideration and you've still only scratched the surface of the excellence that is this record. Shirley Manson's beautiful vocals (probably the best voice of anyone in pop music today) slinking around playfully potent lyrics (""Hey boy take a look at me/ Let me dirty up your mind/I'll strip away your hard veneer/And see what I can find"")will get under your skin. Satisfaction guarenteed? This record will change your definition of satisfaction."
4,Great,Very new back then when it was released. Still a great album! Have on my Ipod and play it regularly.
5,Best first album,"When I discover this record back in 1996, I realized that this group was not one more. Time confirmed that sentence. The sound is totally new and the creative work put on it made one if not the best first record of a band. All tracks are unique and unforgettable; from the open Supervixen to the wonderful closing title Milk.This record is a must for contemporary music. Nothing less."
5,"Review for ""Garbage""","The CD came at a pretty good time, it might've been a little late but it was SO worth it! Absolutely nothing was wrong with the CD and how the music played; it really is a great album!"
4,Good,"This cd is really good. One of the best debut albums in history probely. But listen to version 2.o and you will see they just get better. The music was great on this record for what it is,a debut album."
2,Ive seen garbage better...,"what can i say? ive seen garbage so much better than this. this cd feels extremely depressing to listen to and i try not to hear it for fear of becoming grumpy. this in no way says that i dislike garbage, i love garbage! theyre one of my favorite bands! i dont so much recommend this one, but there are two songs on it i really like... im only happy when it rains, and as heaven is wide. good songs. but i would recommend garbage 2.0 over this one.. beautifulgarbage was also reallllly good :-D"
1,"Lovely surface, little depth","You know how there's some CDs that just get better and better every time you listen to them? Well, this isn't one of them. I bought this album on the strength of its singles, and was very impressed with it on its first listen. However, I have to give it a mixed review,because under the slick surface, there isn't much that makes it worth listening to more than a few times. The dance beats and heavy instrumentation are fun, but the lyrics are distant and uninteresting.If you have plenty of disposable income, by all means, buy this. But be forewarned that it will end up gathering dust after a few months. I'd recommend investing in some artists with a little more staying power instead."
1,"This self-titled debut is exactly as described, GARBAGE!","Yuck. I just bought this album and am very disappointed. The tracks are mooshy, smooshy, distorted guitar with uninspired vocals and synths/drums. It's weak any way you slice it.However, if you like bad music, this CD may be for you.Save your money. I'm sorry I didn't. :("
1,Gag,"Well, it lives up to its title, anyway. Typical '90s trash -- as if this decade needed more of it."
4,Good vibes,"Okay, It's not authentic alternative music, but it still rocks. In my oppinion, the real beauty of the CD comes from Vow and ""As Heaven is wide"". Both selections make excellent workout or motivational musicShirley Manson's most memorable line ""Send me an Angel, I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven"" has almost a BTVS like quality to it. It's a shame this song wasn't culled for the TV soundtrack, but I am proud to have it on my CD player.I really tried to like the radio cuts, but am disappointed they were so darn overmarketed. Manson aside, the fact that the other band members were producers is problaly what accounted for a large number of singles and radio cuts."
5,This cd is better than GARBAGE's latest!!!,"I love both GARBAGE's debut and Version 2.0 releases, but I think their first release was better. It had more guitar and more of a rock sound, as compared to Version 2.0 which has a more techno-pop sound. I loved the melancholy lyrics of songs like ""A Stroke of Luck"" and the eery ""Milk"" (which is one of my fav. GARBAGE songs). And then there were those more up-beat (for that cd) songs that I played on repeat like ""Fix Me Now"" and ""Dog New Tricks."" After hearing this cd, (actually, after hearing their first single, ""Vow"") I quickly decided that GARBAGE had such an ironic name!"
5,Amazing alternative album,"The first time I heard this CD, all I could think was ""Wow!"" If you like alternative music, there's no doubt you'll love this album. Lead singer Shirley Manson's voice is very distinctive and perfect for this type of music. My favorite song on this CD is ""Vow"", but, all the songs are great! You've gotta get this CD!"
4,Trash with Class,"Garbage's debut album comes off like Hole's ""Live Through This"", only with a thicker, glossier coat of Pop sheen. The term ""Pop"" of course had a broader definition a decade ago, especially when compared to what passes for today's milquetoast. Back in the early/mid 90's when radio wasn't afraid to experiment with its format, Garbage's debut came across as very accessible but no less raw, menacing and dark. Make no mistake, Shirley can scare you just as much as Courtney, especially when she spits out lines like ""Now I'm here burning down your house"". It's a formidable debut from probably the most inventive rock band that comes from and has survived the Grunge era of the early/mid 90's."
5,"Garbage ain't garbage, dude.","What amazed me after I'd listened to the entire CD was that none of the songs sounded alike. Each was distinct in its own way. You never found yourself thinking, ""Oh, it's the same tune as that other song."" Obviously the radio songs are good, you've heard them. ""Not My Idea"" kicks, and is stuck in my head right now. ""Supervixen"" is a good starter track. ""Milk"", oh my gosh, has such beautiful, eerie, make-you-feel-weird music. ""As Heaven Is Wide"" is sort of techno-ish. All the songs are good, alright? Get this CD now!"
2,They sure must like Curve.,Save your money and just buy any Curve album. Garbage won't sound too original anymore.
3,Great album - until you hear Version 2.0,"It's a pity I heard Version 2.0 first: their first album shows where many of the later ideas come from, yet they are less developed. Songs like ""Only happy when it rains"" and ""Supervixen"" are my favorites, but this is not their best album. It lacks the rollercoaster aspect of 2.0!If you are a true ""Alt Rock"" fan, then you'll love it - I'm not - preferring the more electronic / dance second album."
4,Now I Get it,"A long time ago a friend whose music taste I trust told me he had just seen an incredible performance at the Fillmore in NY by "" a blues guy named Albert King."" I bought all the available albums and didn't get it. This live recording captures what I have been hoping for. There is no more powerful performance than Albert's "" I'LL Play the Blues For You"". ""Killing FLoor"" does it too.I would give it five stars but it is too short."
4,garmin rail mount adapter,"Received product quickly from vendor and it was exactly as expected.Garmin produced a sturdy, well built system for this mount."
2,A recording that should never have been made,"This Brahms First Cto. came out in on LP in 1976, when the beloved Rubinstein turned 89. He explained in his program note that it was an immense effort to attempt the work, considering his age and near blindness (macular degeneration had blocked out the keyboard except for the extreme upper and lower notes). He should have been talked out of making such an effort. This cautious, often slow reading may get the notes in, but at too high a cost. Mehta tiptoes and tries to cushion the most difficult parts, to no avail. In addition, the Israel Phil. sounds mediocre, especially in the string body, and one only has to hear the opening orchestral part to be discouraged: Mehta vacillates between slackness and aggressive punches. Decca's close miking exposes the piano cruelly. There's some stylish phrasing; even so, this one is a definite miss."
3,More for younger readers,I didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would. Younger people might enjoy this and so I have not much to say about it.
1,Neither annotated nor introduced,"This edition claims to be an ""annotated edition"" but it is not. The formatting is odd and not kindle=friendly. I have never heard of the publisher. You are better off reading a free on-line version than buying this one."
4,Peter Pan & Wendy Darling,"I'm sitting at my desk, thinking of the Neverland. How is I've forgotten it already? When I was a child, my sister and me had our own 'Neverland', where adventures could be lived and then neatly tucked away for tomorrow. While reading this book, I remembered. I remembered the freeing experience of being whomever you wanted to be, without the concern of practicality. The book Peter and Wendy lets you revisit that feeling, then neatly put it away. I would recommend everyone read this at least twice, once for themselves and once for their children. May we never forget our own flying days!"
3,Very different to the Disney version,"This was interesting to read. I quite enjoyed it, however it is much darker than what I expected with my only experience of Peter Pan being the Disney version. Both Peter and Tinkerbell were quite annoying characters who I didn't like much!"
5,Sweet peter,This story is wonderful in every way.You too will be itching to fly to Neverland!Peter pan lovers must read!
5,A wonderful book made better....,I purchased this book because of the Wispersync. It's great that you can read/ listen to the book and they're coordinated.
4,Childhood reborn,Just like how I remember it from my childhood. Quality was great and the story was exactly the one you expected to read.
1,Kind of odd-looking,"The cover really looks like the picture, black and white, with the words ""Affordable & High Quality Paperback Book Edition"" plastered across the front. There are no pictures, and the text looks as if it had been typed on an old-fashioned typewriter. Not a very good value for the price!"
4,A Good Buy,"These car mats are a good buy. They have ridges where you can trim them to fit exactly to your vehicle. I like they way they look, and the rubber in the often worn area will insure they last a very long time."
5,car mats,mats fit perfectly. i trimmed a litle off the back mats which was easy to do. they are heavy mats which is good because they don't slide around. good value.
1,Really poor quality,"Awful video and sound, sometimes unintelligible. The print looks like a badly colorized B/W film. I'm returning it."
1,rudyyard kiplings jungle book,this was not the movie i was looking for it was the other jungle book that i found out is no longer for sale unless you want to pay 52 dollars for a used movie
2,Too many empty calories,"I don't usually write reviews but I was really disappointed by this book. I was entirely prepared for light entertainment and wasn't looking for a whole lot of meaning, was even able to wade through all of the cooking descriptions and several descriptions of cashmere exercise outfits, but really was disappointed in the end by how the plot fell apart upon even slight examination.I am not going to write any spoilers but suffice to say that it just doesn't add up when all is said and done - none of the character's motivations make any sense and that added on top of the aforementioned trivia makes me rate this poorly.if you are going to do alot of research, you need to make that actually seem like a story -- otherwise, write for gourmet or airline magazines about food and glamourous places.my .02"
5,NuFinish Car Wash,"Excellent! I use it on the moneypit, the Porsche 911, and also the reliable car, the Honda Civic. Buy it!"
1,This is NOT an OFFICIAL KISS VIDEO,"People, by now you should know that anyone with a bootleg video tape collection could throw one of these together. Kiss owns the rights to their logo. So, if you do not see the original KISS logo with the lightning bolt SS, it's NOT AN OFFICIAL KISS RELEASE! Buyer beware!"
2,Not the dvd we expected!?!,"Apparently this is not the ""promo videos collection"" dvd we had expected, but yet just another re-hashed collection of interviews, etc...very disappointing"
4,"Excellent, lucid, compassionate and comforting",This is an excellent book on dark period in a person's life that is so often pathologized in our culture. It presents a compassionate view of the existential dilemmas of life and the cyclic nature of consolation and desolation that occur in introspective people.Thomas Moore writes in a very lyrical way and his analogies and examples are very poignant. He talks about the function of dark periods as putting us in touch with soul. This is a great message for a culture that often sweeps pain under the rug or is so busy that there is no value seen in taking time to listening to what pain has to say about life.This book is a comfort to anyone suffering from any kind of psychological pain from existential crisis to difficult life transitions. It reframes pain in a positive light and offers hope to the reader.
4,So good...,"This book is great and really help you during hard times. It helps you realize that ""bad"" or ""hard"" things are not necessarily negative. It has so many messages that I will not try to summarize them here. :) Go ahead and get this book. The title says it all."
1,Dark Night of The Soul,The book was bought as new but there were pages dog eared and underlining throught out. I am shocked that this was not discovered before the bokk was mailed to me
2,A great find!,This book really takes a deeper look at how challenges and adveristies affect you. It definatly makes a connection with the reader and it is very helpfull. The author speaks to you as though you are having a conversation and offers some wonderfull advice. I would highly reccomend this book.
3,approach with caution,I wouldn't recommend reading this if you are suffering from depression. The subject matter is very heavy and will only make matters worse.
5,Insightful and encouraging,I love the book because it has helped me to put those dark places that have/will occur in my life in a place that makes sense and enables me to move forward.
3,Extremely deep and meditative. The author seems to be lost in his own life experiences not knowing what to do.,Would recommend if you have the capacity to analyze self in relationship to self and exterior personalities. Confusing? So is the book.
4,Misleading Title,"Despite its title, this book has absolutely nothing to do with the Dark Night of the Soul. Moore admits early on that he has co-opted only the title from the classic work by John of the Cross. Moore's book is about spiritual and emotional crisis. In the original by John of the Cross, the Dark Night is not about crisis, it is about deeper union with God... the ""dark night"" is a metaphor for the place where lovers meet. Moore's book is okay if you are looking for a self-help pop psychology book. But if you were looking for a book about deepening spirituality, you should read Gerald May's book of the same title instead. I think it is important to add this note, in case someone might be led to believe that this book is about the Dark Night of the Soul, or about John of the Cross, or about spirituality. It isn't."
1,Book not as described,"This is just to alert someone in Amazon that the book that came wasn't the book I ordered. I ordered the Penguin Classics edition, which was described as having 304 pages and included the two novellas besides the excellent ""Cranford."" The picture on the book that came is the same as the one pictured on the website, but the book I received only has 257 pages and doesn't have the two novellas, which is why I wished to have this edition.Now I notice that the great reviews of this book are from some other edition -- strange and misleading. How can be sure to get the right one?"
3,not if you're looking for a story,"This book has been called Gaskell's greatest, something I just cannot agree with. ok, so it provides an sharp insight into the small town life of the time. But there isn't much of a plot. Far more worthy are Mary Barton, North and South or her others, I can't comment on Ruth as I haven't read it yet."
4,Cranford,"delivery time and price of book where great, I just wish the deliveries to Australia werent so high!"
4,Who Are You ?,"I loved this novel but it's not for everyone.This is a gentle comedy, in which the author pokes in a kindly manner at Victorian culture of the time.I found it to be very enjoyable. The novel is very well written and first appeared as many of Charles Dickens works did, in the form of a serial in a magazine. In fact Dickens was the editor of the publication this novel first appeared in.I highly recommend this novel for those who enjoy Victorian prose."
5,Delightful read.,"Gaskills character sketches are delightful to read. Her descriptions of village life are spot on. I have lived in a small village all my life, and with the exceptions of technologies and British class systems, this is how a small town still operates. Loved reading it and followed with the other novels based in Cranford ASAP."
4,Long lost tracks from an under-rated talent,"The material on this album varies from early demo's (""There's a love"" is the earliest) through publishing demo's (""Love will find a way"" is a good example), to songs that were readied for release under Bell's name.In the latter context ""Quittin'Time"" was eventually thought to be too much like the material they were cutting with Johnny Taylor, whilst ""Forever wouldn't be too long"" sounds like a Sam and Dave out-take. Most of the tracks are far sparser than the normal Stax sound, and there's rather more piano than you normally find on released Stax tracks. There are two stand out tracks; ""Will you still love me tomorrow"" owes little to the Shirelles version, and ""She wont be like you"" would be a surefire hit for any current soul giant who cared to re-record it! Throughout Bell provides proof of what a great performer he could be in a range of styles."
2,Not worth the price,I bought this come because it said it would help with your teeth but I found most chewing gum carries the same ingredients so I don't suggest buying it for their advertised reason. As far as taste goes it tastes rather fruity for maybe 20 seconds and then the flavor quickly fades. In my opinion not worth buying better off just buying a regular packet of gum. You'll find most sugar free gum contains xylitol. The set look at the packaging.
1,Xylitol dangers,"To make sure everyone has a clear view before buying, the other side of the coin is that studies show xylitol also causes some health problems, such as headaches and queasiness.Personally, every time I consume or chew something with xylitol, I can't eat the rest of the day because I get so queasy."
4,Better than I thought it would be,"I didnt think that this gum was going to be that good, that is why I bought the 100 piece package. I got the smaller size to sample what it would taste like, and I figured if I like it then I would buy the bigger jar. One piece of gum really doesnt do it for me. I need to chew two pieces at the same time to feel like I am chewing a substantial piece of gum. The flavor is not very long lasting, but it seems to be the norm these days when it comes to gum. I dont know why that is, but I have noticed it with other gums as well. I am pleased with the fact that there is no aspartame in this gum. I didnt know that most sugar free products contain aspartame. I had double checked the ingredients in this gum before I made my purchase. I am pretty satisfied overall with the gum."
1,Lost flavor,The flavor didn't even last two minutes. I didn't expect it to last long but less than two minutes! Total waste of money.
1,Won't buy again,"The gum is far too sweet, and the flavor wears off in mere minutes. That it contains Xylitol is great, but other flavors and brands do too, and I will try those instead of buying this again."
2,summary: think flavor-less gum + xylitol mouth wash coating,"2 stars because it actually delivers xylitol to my mouthhowever, as far as i can tell, all of the xylitol is found in the hard coating, not in the gum itself. therefore, unless you avoid chewing the gum, virtually all of the xylitol goes into salival suspension within a couple minutes, and you either have to swish a mouthful of spit around in order to expose your mouth biota to the xylitol for an extended period, or continually add new pieces of gum.-3 stars because the xylitol is only present in a significant amount as long as i dont swallow. the economics of buying pure bulk xylitol are probably better. the xylitol shouldve been infused into the gum.no word on if it helps slow or halt tooth decay, if anyone knows a strong strategy on remineralizing teeth (other than a better diet, im broke) please let me know in the comments, thanks."
2,Their Worst Flavor,"I use Spry xylitol gum regularly for a variety of reasons. I've tried all flavors and this is by far the worst, with a strong artificial taste. Try one of the natural flavors. Two stars instead of one just because it's xylitol."
1,Not Naturally Flavored,"We've gotten other flavors of Spry gum from natural food stores and liked them. So, I was excited to see fruit flavor available. However, I was very disappointed when we received it and it was artificially flavored. Not a big deal to most people, but it is to us. The only reason I ordered it was because I thought it was all natural. My kids did try it before we realized it, and they liked the flavor, but I ended up throwing most of it away. If I want artificially flavored gum, I can get that anywhere. I don't need to order it. So, if your buying this just for the no sugar aspect this might be okay, but if you want ""all natural"" look for something else."
3,flavor is weak and goes away quickly,"This gum has an initial flavor that is watery and thinned down, and then quickly gets chewed out. The texture is fairly pleasant-- it does not get tough and chewy, but there's basically no flavor after 10 chews."
5,Killer Game,This is one of the best shooters with one of the best multi-player modes ever and 80+ games the fun never ends!!! If you dont get a guncon (witch is a playstation light gun) the game is horrible. But with a Guncon it is the perfect game!
4,The Sauce Delivers!,"Compelling and funny read on understanding the female psyche and how an ordinary man can apply the ""Sauce"" techniques to winning a woman over in a disciplined and novel approach. What a riot - material really hits home with both men and womem alike!"
4,Dishing The Sauce :,"Whoever said you didn't need college math outside of school was dead wrong. Witty, insightful and downright in your face funny advice on how to avoid the ""Soy Lifestyle"" and enjoy yourself in the dating world."
4,A Calculus of Dating!,"The Sauce is an irreverent look at dating, seemingly superficial but based on deeper rhythms of interpersonal attraction - what approach will get a guy noticed? While the premise that women prefer the ""Bad Seed"" at the beginning of a relationship may seem like simple misogyny, it actually speaks to some women's preference for (and some men's need to be) a strong, confident, and assertive predator. Evolutionary psychologists will love it, and thoughtful individuals can use the calculus to clarify their own approach to the hunt."
5,Saucy,"Ok - so I never realized I wanted to change my bad seed Bob to a good seed! This book is filled with little insights on what we do as women when we want to get a man and what we do once we get them - things we never realized. It's also nice that they get the word out on the Hair Pull - it's about time!! We know we love it! Excellent book, insighful, entertaining, and it will make you laugh and roll your eyes occasionally. It wouldn't be ""saucy"" if it didn't."
4,"Be the Boss, read the Sauce!","The Sauce is how most books should be written. Short, concise, and to the point with just enough of a twist of humor and literary flair for the reader to enjoy the learning experience. The information is also dead on accurate as far as my experience has been. The Sauce provides the information you need to understanding women. The hard and fun part will be putting what you've learned into action. Buy the Sauce and happy dating!"
4,Compelling and accurate,"After years of working the good seed angle and wondering why my bad seed buds were getting more than yours truly, our authors have provided revealing evidence of courting dynamics that helps to bring closure on the subject. Bound to become regarded as the Bible for gittin' sum. Rock on Bobs!"
4,Absolutely Hilarious,"This is the funniest thing which I've read in a long time!!Everyone has thoughts about how to best tackle relationships, but I'd have to say that this is the most unique approach which I have ever read!!"
4,Where were you in the 90's?,As a happily married woman for 5 years I enjoyed reading the author's insight into the world of dating. I only wish that I had a handy resource like this in the late 90's when I was fumbling through my life of soy with Bad Seed Bob's.
3,Interesting but repetitive,The book is interesting in how it presents the story - the chapters are broken down into theme (not time periods) and all presidential families that fit that theme are discussed in the chapter. A unique and fun way to learn about the families. On the downside the author makes the same points over and over and over again through out the book and also assumes that readers are intimately familiar with every president ever to hold office and will no all about them already - as such a lot of reference are by last or first name only and don't contain much background information.Overall it's a new spin for people who've read a lot of books on presidential history but if you're new to the topic - pick a different book.
3,Not top flight Merton,"Its odd, how things work out. In his Journals, Merton was ENTHRALLED by this reterat. He spoke in glowing terms of the participants,and praised the intamcy achieved. He states, flatly""this is the best reterat of my life."" Yet none of that comes forth in this collection, which is more the pity. Of course, some of this is indeed dated[the world is radically changed in 33+ years]and perhaps, as it seems Fr. Merton was wont to do, he gets overly enthusiastic about something before he has completely immersed himself.Still, second level Merton is better then just about top shelf from anyone else.Some nuggets on prayer left me thinking that perhaps the great moments of this retreat were the celebration of the Mass that were held each day. In that silence was perhaps that ineffable moment that cannot be heard nor touched that Merton groped for so in his life and writings. So, in all not great Thomas Merton, thjough still necessary to see the entire picture of this good great man."
2,Thomas Merton's Chit-Chat,"This volume contains lectures which Thomas Merton gave to nuns of the Loretto community during late 1967 and early 1968. He manages to say almost nothing of substance, except that ""contemplation"" (however we define it) is good, and that authoritarian structures are bad. Only the most fervent devotees of the somewhat trendy Trappist would find this book ineluctable; the rest of us can profit by avoiding it. We look to his earlier work for nourishment: Thoughts in Solitude (1958), New Seeds of Contemplation (1961), and many of his poems and journals. THE SPRINGS OF CONTEMPLATION strikes this reader as needless chit-chat about silence. We do not find God in the book, but a tired talkative Merton who is a bit too convinced of his own sagacity. Alas."
1,PCVC690K,Philips has no support for Windows XP ubtil Jan 2002. Now I await a month and a half to use the features it advertises.
2,Yawn Of The Gorilla,"I have seen worse films than ""Bride of the Gorilla,"" but few that seem to drag on longer. Raymond Burr actually does a decent job as Barney Chavez, a plantation manager who decides he wants the wife of the plantation owner for himself. In fact the acting is fairly decent all the way around (especially for this era and genre) but the plot bogs down in a very slow romance subplot for the majority of the middle thirty minutes of the film.In essence Barney commits murder with a giant poisonous snake, and is subsequently cursed by a witch for his unsavory behavior. The practical upshot of this is that we get to see Raymond Burr transmogrify into a gorilla, though it is mostly seen in reflection shots (mirrors, lakes, etc.) Ultimately everyone gets their just rewards, and after what seems like 66 very long minutes, you can try to forget you wasted an hour of your life on this bore.Bottom line: it really isn't that bad, it's just boring."
2,Which DVD,There are two DVD releases of BRIDE OF THE GORILLA - is there any difference in print quality between them???
3,Monkey Shines...,"Raymond Burr (Godzilla, Rear Window, TVs Perry Mason, Ironside) is Barney Chavez, south american plantation foreman and babe magnet. He's been having an affair with his boss' wife Dina (Barbara Payton), while stringing along a beautiful native gal. Barney kills his boss by getting a poisonous python (?!) to bite him. He quickly marries Dina and lives happily ever after.... NOT! Unfortunately for ol' Barn, a servant woman, who just happens to be a witch, witnessed the murder. She decides to use her dark arts to turn Barney into a go-rilla! He begins longing for the jungle and slipping out at night to lumber through the trees. Police commissioner Tora (Lon Chaney jr.) waxes philosophical as he attempts to solve the homicide. Not bad, but I kept asking myself, ""If Barney is such a total creep, why didn't he just marry Dina and fool around with that native cutie on the side?"" Oh well, I'll never know. Worth a peek..."
4,Most Enjoyable,"Despite its established (and well-deserved) B-movie status, ""Bride of the Gorilla"" is a surprisingly effective, entertaining, and well-done movie. I was particularly impressed by the intelligent and original variation on a theme that was tried-and-true (indeed, rather exhausted) even a virtual half-century ago. Oh, to be sure, all the usual B-movie trappings are here -- e.g., the inevitable stock jungle footage. But wouldn't you be disappointed if it weren't?Recommended."
3,Another good flick by the great Kurt Siodmak!!,"This was actually a pretty enjoyable B movie. Lon Chaney is a bit out of place here and not given much to do. Raymond Burr gives a great over the top chauvenistic style performance delivering some super quotable lines. It sports a very nice script and great job on direction by Kurt Siodmak. I always felt he was among the best of the B movie directors of the 50's who always paid great attention to the smaller details that add to the realistic telling of absurd stories. Check out his film Magnetic Monster with Richard Carlson if you can find it. I wish they would have given Kurt larger budgets/projects throughout the 50's.The Alpha DVD is relatively cheap, has great sound and a nice crisp clear transfer. Also includes the original trailer. Recommended for fans of 50's B grade fun."
5,Should be required reading for every American,"Unfortunately they don't teach this in schools, or publish it in the newspaper. But knowing the truth will set you free."
3,Cotton Candy Weekend,"After buying and enjoying most of Ultra Weekend I, I had high hopes that Ultra II would follow along in the same style. At first glance the artists looked promising, but after listening I was rather disappointed.Although there are a couple of tracks on Disc 1 that are good, for the most part it reminds me of cotton candy - too pop-sweet for me to enjoy for very long. And the beats are hardly original.Disc 2 is the better of the two because the mixes are more original, the tracks flow better, and the beats are more varied."
2,Mainstream Remixes,"CD-1, I could barely tolerate. I personnally haven't heard too many Top 40 Pop songs remixed as trance versions that I have actually liked, anywhere.CD-2 Much improved. Pretty good track selection if you are into house. I'm more of a trance fan.Overall, disappointed."
2,ultra weekend,"this is a 2 disk cd. the first cd, if full of songs that you may have heard on the radio. kelly clarkson, is one of the singers on the cd. that is the main reason why i purchased the cd. love that remix. the other songs are ok, but the 1 cd is the best of the 2."
3,"Eh, it's okay.","I've read a few of the stories. There are quite a few mis-spellings, which my friend and I caught right away because we worked for a newspaper. But as far as the stories go, it DOES have a pretty good selection of fantasy's, not too many I was too into though. But it was still pretty hot to read."
4,Non Fiction,"I suppose you could call this historical forensics. Geoffrey Ashe attempts to sift through all the legends and fiction surrounding King Arthur to see if he can pin down who the actual man might have been and when he might actually have lived and where. Apparently Ashe is a well known Arthurian scholar, and the books reads that way."
1,Tough to Justify,"There are a lot of compiler books out there--many of which are quite good--and reading the back cover and the preface provide no clue as to why the author or publisher thought one would prefer this book over another. It's pretty obviously fleshed out (very slightly) from lecture notes, overly terse, not well written, and not well edited. I'd avoid this--Appel and the dragon book are both much, much better."
4,Open Society and Its Enemies,Karl Popper's antagonistic personallity comes through loud and clear. He seems to blame Plato for having to leave Vienna due to Hitler. He wrote the book while in New Zealand just prior and during the war and makes an outstanding case for his belief. The book is a joy to read.
3,A classic,It's a good old book. Just started reading it. It seems to take place in Florence Italy. It's okay. Waiting to get to the point.
5,Love Softwalk,"Great clogs, available in WW if you need them (and I need them!). The ""Murietta"" style comes in many colors and textures. I must have 5-6 pairs. I started buying them a few years ago, and still buy a couple every year. They're durable, comfortable and stylish."
3,"cute , but not right for me","They seemed comfortable and the style was cute, but the heel was too high for me. I felt unstable walking in them. Had to send them back."
1,not what they say they are,"They claim to be 4 gauge, but not even close. Not a problem if you are jumping a little Honda, but definitely a problem for more demanding work. Compare with 8 gauge cables... not 4 gauge.The lowest star rating is 1. These deserve 0."
2,Flea-Market-Quality,"I had the exact same experience as others: I received an off-brand, set of crappy-cheap jumper cables made in China and packaged in a cheap vinyl bag with a hole for hanging from a peg-board display. I e-mailed the company for an immediate refund including shipping. They refunded immediately (fulfilled and refunded by amazon.com), wrote me back with an apology and refunded that day. Seller fulfilled their agreement with the prompt and complete refund, however, I would have rather spent that time doing something else (1 star for product- 5 stars for service, but I'm not rating the service)."
4,Wish I could meet the writer,"Anne Elliot Crompton is as much of a poet as she is a writer. I fell in love with _Merlin's Harp_ and have been searching out her publications ever since._A Woman's Place_ is a journey through time, which follows five women who have lived in the same home. Each of the women is at a different phase in her life and at a different phase in this country's history. However, each of them tells a universal story of what we long for, be it stability, love, a child, or independence.Ms. Crompton speaks to the struggle within ourselves. She doesn't diminish the importance of the individual struggle, but by showing us 200 years' of various women's experiences the struggle seems more acceptable."
4,Very pleasant mix of traditional Christian music,"As the review of the first in the series mentions, Mr. Sarta is best without a singer. These traditional tunes are nicely played and appropriate for incidental music when no instrumentalist is available."
5,A very pleasant and rewarding album!,"The unmistakable and unflinching style of this sax virtuoso is carved in relief once more with this fantastic album. Sanborn possesses an overflowing talent and undeniable sense of the rhythm and musicality as a few. The arrangements are superb and his musical support is of first rate; Marcus Miller and Michael Colina conform a fabulous team.An artistic feat from start to finish. If you are thinking to give a special present, this might be your choice. It is appropriate for any relaxing hour."
2,non-debaters beware!,"Purchased this book for an Argumentation class. I was very excited about debating issues with fellow classmates. We were required to read two chapters each night and come to class prepared to discuss them. I'm not a ""professional"" debater nor do I use the terminology in this book on a daily basis. It was next to impossible to read/comprehend the material and I felt really dumb going to class not knowing what we were going to discuss. The definitions given don't really explain things in ""dummy"" terms and if you're not familiar with the language or debate process, good luck! I suppose the way the book is set up (the order of the chapters) are good & useful, but again it's the definitions that really hurt my learning in this course. If you're using this for an Intro class, hopefully your teacher will review what you need to know!"
2,clowning around,"This costume looked most attractive in the catalogue pix. The fabric is cheap looking. It is constantly creased, and it looks like it will fall apart after a few washings. I did not return it because I needed it for a special event. I do not think I will deal with that company in the future."
3,"An animated video that won't leave you ""Blue""!","Leo the Lion: Blue Lion is vol. 3 from the Palm Beach Entertainment series Leo the Lion King of the Jungle. Leo follows the series Kimba the White Lion as the next generation of white lion kings adventures on. I loved this video it contains excellent animation being a mid-80's style of Anime or Japanese animation and the characters are very endearing and colorful. The video also presents a moral lesson in life for it's viewers as well as enough action and plot to still entertain. My only critizations would be that the picture quality could be better with questionable filming quality. Also the ending of the video is not a typical ""Happy Ending"" and may not be suitible for all younger viewers. Otherwise though a must for any cartoon buff or Anime buff and one of the better animated series out there I feel. Don't take my word for it though, it's worth checking out!"
1,Do not buy Breezaire or From Beverage Factory,"I bought 2 Breezaire 4000 units thru Beverage Factory and while the fist worked for 5 years, the second never worked and after back-and-forth for over a year with Breezaire Service without getting it fixed, I found myself no longer covered by the one year warranty and having to pay to ship and repair a $1,100 product that never worked. Eventually, I gave up and threw it out. The dump is too good for this piece of junk. Beverage Factory was useless, not standing by a product they sold and just passing me on the Breezaire Service."
4,Awesome CD,"This album was recorded at Stax records three years after founding Sweet Inspiration member, Cissy Houston, left the group for a solo career. The other three girls Estelle, Myrna, and Sylvia was able to carry on. These girls was mainly employed as Elvis Presley background singers for the rest of his life and career. The album itself is great. You roam the second song is my favorite. Call me when all else fails is a slow bluesy staxy song. Also on this cd is their signature song Sweet Inspiration featuring Cissy Houston."
5,Monopoly Spiderman edition,"My 7 year old nephew loves Spiderman, and this was a hit with him. Makes his family game night extra fun!"
3,Monopoly is Monopoly,"Another fun Monopoly game. However, lets face it; all Monopoly games are the very same with just different names on the spaces. My family just enjoys collecting the different versions of the game for some odd reason and if your family is the same, then you will enjoy this colorful version. Otherwise stick with the original."
5,Psalm One Is ill!,"This Lady Holds Her Own On This Album Which I Had To Track Down And Buy After Hearing Death Of A Frequent Flyer. This Album Is So Soulful And Gives You That Hip Hop You Can Feel In Your Veins. ""Think To Much"", ""A Girl Named You"" and ""Life After Champaign County"" Are My Favorite Tracks On The Album She Deserves A Medal For Keeping Hip Hop Alive With This One!"
5,extra good,"this is definitely ronnie's blues side, and it is a side that i for one enjoy seeing him show. he is showcased on wayne's blues and bonehead too but every track is a showcase. the virtuoso of the strat plays that sweet, clean sound with darrell nulisch on harp and vocals. this one kicks it."
2,Electrafixion,"I startarted to think all the old bands were losing it and it was foolish for them to continue to make albums. Continuing to purchase these I found out I was wrong. Many are still vital. Unfortunately Echo isn't one of them. They copy much of their old material, many times the worst stuff and have become rather bland. Three songs are worhtwhile here and they are not classics. Fans will appreciate, ""All Because Of You Days"", ""Parthenon Drive"", and ""Scissors In The Sand"". Too bad there isn't more, hopefully they will regain their magic."
3,Halfway back,"After Ian McCulloch's departure and subsequent return to Echo & The Bunnymen, I haven't been too impressed with anything the band has done. Siberia comes much closer to the the Bunnymen of old than recent recordings. The first two songs, Stormy Weather and Because Of You Days feel like they could have easily been leftovers from Ocean Rain. It's the quieter more mature Bunnymen but still packing some punch. Unfortunately the album drops off into several bland and ultimately forgettable songs. Scissors In the Sand makes a valiant attempt at a harder edge sound but doesn't quite make it. The final number,the melancholy What If We Are? is a bit of saving grace and is a reminder that Mac and the boys can still write beautiful songs... every so often."
5,Simply Awesome!,"Fresh, exciting, haunting. They were, and ARE, an amazing musical outfit, and anyone who has never heard them should buy this album. Tremendous."
4,Charming memory,I am collecting charms that have meaning for me. My mother was a terrific seamstress so this charm is a nice memory of her. I would have liked more detail on the charm.
1,I !have not received it yet,"Sorry, I cannot rate yet, as I have not received the item! I will be happy to rate this item when I receive it."
1,- for purists only,"The entire recording consists of a series of 78 rpm sides with two songs per side and in one case three - drastically cut - and performed with absolutely no sense of character or showmanship. The 11 selections are over in about 18 minutes. The producers try to give you a bit more for your money in selecting five Berlin songs (in one case Dinah Shore repeating DOIN WHAT COMES NATURALLY)performed by popular artists of the day, but this only brings the total timing for the CD to about 35 minutes. This is for ANNIE lovers only and purists who must have all the cast recordings regardless of the quality. If you're looking for the best ANNIE there is stick with the 1966 Lincoln Center Revival or if you can find the out of print Criswell/Hampson complete recording, get that."
3,Super Reader,"Mercant and Rhodan are forced to combat more agents of the Mind Snatchers, who are now attempting political and economic destabilisation.Khrest is involved with training the Mutant Corps. Tamo Yoshida is dealing with the twin abilities of telekinesis and transmutation, and Miss Ishi is a televiewer.Rhodan uses Ernst Ellert's teletemporal abilities to see what the aliens are up to, but Ellert is lost in the timestream, while doing so, and a housing facility is built for his body, which is still alive."
4,A GREAT GAME!,"This is a great Game. Compared to the first or second one this one is much better. There are over 70 minigames to play and it includes a story mode and a party mode. This game is great for multiplayer but not good for single player. In the single player mode the comps are either too easy or too hard and since the only human player is you it makes the game dull, turn after turn after turn. Multiplayer on the other hand is awesome especially at parties. Since you are facing human players the game gets a lot more fun and a lot more interesting. Also a plus to this game compared to the first two is that there are more modes of play, more characters, and best of all you don't have to ""buy"" the minigames. Also there are new items you can buy on the game boards."
3,A Homebrew File,"This game has eight playable characters, compared to six from the previous titles. However, being one of the last N64 games, it does make me sad."
4,its extreme fun!!!,"If you ever tried this, u would fall in love with it. Yet, watch out!! a the mini-games are new. No ""Hot rope jump"" or ""Skateboard scamper"". Here, you have ""Cheep cheep chase"" and ""Eatza pizza"". All though some of the mini games & board games can be a rip sometimes...I still like 1p (story) mode. I already have 3 faces on the stone behind the castle. Anyway, you would love this if you rented it or owned it. Now, theres even Boo repellant to drive him away when he comes calling. Theres eave a Koopa card to widthdraw all the coins in the bank!!! It's really amazing. Try it for yourself."
1,Mario Party3,"I would have loved to try this game, but I was sent Mario Paper Instead. I was quite disappointed. I very well could'nt send it Mario Paper back because this was supposed to be a gift. Mario Paper was not what this person wanted, and had to be presented as a gift the day I received it. Sooooo, I will order Mario Party3 once more and try to get and pay for the right choice this time.Mary Williams"
2,it just isnt likeable anymore,yeah sure it was a good game at first keyword:WAS. Mario party 4 is out and mario party 3 just cant compete anymore. So to all those people out there who still are trying to convince people that classics are still some of the best around especially this one face it this games dead.
1,A Complete Yawn,"I did not like this game. I played Mario Party 3 before I played 2 and 1. Mario Party 3 is a board game. All you do is go around a board and pick up items. This game is outragously overrated. (and over priced!) If you want a board game, save $$$ and buy a BOARD game."
1,"Boring, Boring, and guess what? yeah boring","This game is the worst of the three. Messy, aweful games, and same characters. DON'T BUY!"
2,I don' like this game...,"This game is really bad. I think that because 1.Very hard 2.the mini-games are really not that good 3.bad graphics 4.gets very boring 5.I don't like the Mario party series 6.The NPC's are either to smart, or too dumb 7.When you don't win...you sorda get frustrated 8.Nothing Really new, except Mini-games...which some are just plain stupid 9.On mini-games, if you are the one who is being attacked, you probably will lose. Well, you wonder why I put 2 stars? Well, because the first time you play it, it is mediocre. Well thank you and goodnight."
4,The better Party,"I have not played Mario Party, but I have played Mario Party 2 and I found it extremely boring.. I played this with my friends and I can say, hands down the mini games are much better in this version. The one player mode in this is a snooz, but the multiplayer mode is great if you have a lot of friends. I do wish though that the graphics would be improved, and that the mini games involving no skill would be gone."
4,Fair Enough,"I have recently purchased this game on my N64, and I'd say Mario Party 3 is a decent game to keep but not at its best.>>On the bright side, this is an ultimate Mario Party game so it would be nice to have one of these. It's full of brand new fun mini-games plus two extra characters to choose from. I really admire the Duel Mode where you get to hire friends in RPG-style battles. And finally, random selections add on to the element of surprise.>>Unfortunately, the graphics are not well-made, hands down. Why couldn't they produce better graphics? Well, I guess you just have to live with those angular 3D look in N64. Also, you'll have to wait a lot for your turn to roll the die. Playing ONE board game could take more than an hour to complete.Bottom Line: If you enjoy multiplayer games, Mario games and surprises, go for it. But if you'd prefer more mature games and sports games, then this is not your type. In my opinion, bad graphics is the only major flaw in Mario Party 3."
4,Mario Party 3,"A good game for 3 or 4 people, not as good with only 1 or 2. Must be willing to invest a little time in the game in order to learn the ins and outs. Excellent replay value."
4,Still a good N64 game,"Even though this game is out-dated and there's a new Mario Party game for Game Cube, Mario Party 3 is still a good game to buy if you haven't played it. The only thing is it's hard to find now because it's out of stock. This game has 70 new mini-games, 2 new characters, two different kinds of board games, ""action time"" which happens on board games and as many as 20 items. There is even a new board game space called ""game guy"" but it is not a good one. Other then these new things and the story plot, the game has basically not changed much since Mario Party 2. Just as in any Mario Party game, the bad thing about Mario Party 3 is the waiting-- even when the board game is set to 10 turns, the lowest it can go, it can still take as much as 60 minutes to complete. A good idea would be to save and continue later. I can't say the graphics are brilliant but they're not terrible either."
3,Better challenge,"Well, i say it is better than mario party 1 and 2, the best part about it is that when somthing special happens at the last part of the story. so simply put, this game is ok."
5,Mario Party 3 RULES!!!,"Mario Party 3 is my favorite N64 game. I never really got into the other mario party games, but this one RULES!!! You are always occupied doing something, like story mode (if you want) or unlocking mini-games. I like spending my time playing the awesome mini-games. Except, ordering this game on amazon, it is pretty expensive. I would recommend looking at a used electronics store to buy this game, and if you buy it pre-owned you will have a head-start!! Overall, this is a really great game. I recommend it for people ages 7-14 but even my grandma and dad played some mini games!!!p.s. if you have gamecube, i also highly highly recommend Mario Party 4!!!"
5,Absolutely Incredible,"Wow I just have to say wonderful service! The game came in about 7 days after i ordered it, the cartilage was in condition... The game itself is ok but slightly annoying ! ! :( i'm not so sure about wario or waluigi, i think they are trying to take over the world!!!!"
3,This again...?,"Having played the firs two games in the ""Mario Party"" series, I decided to give this one a try. I hate the first one, the second one was a little better, and this one is the best of the bunch. The mini-games are less sadistic(making them more fun), and thankfully those stupid outfits from the second edition were left out. The game boards are more complex, making the game much more enjoyable, and the game control is much more straight forward.Daisy and Walugui have been thrown in there too(both are only playable in the battle modes), and seem to be an afterthought. Neither one of them really shine and are not included in the opening sequence. The fun really lies in playing with your friends. The computer likes to cheat, yelling at your console isn't nearly as fun as yelling at your friends. The game is worth a rental, especially if you have kids."
2,Bad Moon rising,"I purchased this after the death of Rev. Moon in an effort to learn more about him and the Unification Church. I was disappointed in this e-book. There was very little new information. what is in this e-book is what you can find in an online search. I expected a more in-depth study on this topic. If your looking to learn about the Moonies, I would look somewhere else."
5,Perfect Texas Listening,"These guys are great! I have seen them live a few times and they can put on a show. This album is such a great choice for any Texas Music lover. They are great guys as well, some of them even went to my high school."
2,"Great Romances? More like, Great Disappointments","For me, I was disappointed in my copy of ""Lovers."" Mostly, because I consider 'true lovers' to actually stay together. Many of the couples featured in this book became separated or divorced. Sorry, not my idea of true love, or romance either.Plus, I'd prefer more photos than just the single one per couple. The lowercase font used as a title for each bio was really annoying, and the format (one large photo and an essay), tedious. Also, there were few contemporary 'lovers.'Since its publication this book has become obsolete. (As the ill-fated Anne Heche and Ellen deGenerres romance will suggest).Overall, I've seen books which handle this subject much better. I'd give this one a pass, or pick it up at the library before purchasing."
3,Good product...in theory,"I recently moved into a new home and had some work done. The workmen couldn't save the old doorbell chimes so I tried to put up a new one. I ordered this from Amazon and got it in no time. It's pretty fool proof...or so you'd think. I followed all of the directions but directions do no good when you are trying to use modern technology with 1950's wiring. Sure, it's not necessarily the fault of this chime, but it's supposed to be a compatible technology. The ultimate problem: The bell won't disengage. It sounds great the first time, but it becomes useless after that because it's constantly stuck and humming. Maybe it's just a faulty unit. Either way, I rate it at a neutral rating."
5,One of Stax Finest!!! A Must Have!!,"Ruby Johnson is relatively unknown, but she definately put out some of Stax finest music. With Booker T. & the M.G.'s and The Memphis Horns as her backing band, how could you go wrong?? Not to mention her SWEET/GRITTY/SOULFUL voice. If you like soul music DON'T pass this by."
1,Do not buy this?,"As a long time karate student is was hoping for a bit of quality from Don and his gang at Hollywood Productions. I was disappointed, it's simply a third rate copy of someones home movie at the Jundokan, poor sound, poor quality video, there was nothing in here that a few minutes on You Tube wouldn't get you . Another rip off by D.W. A waste of my money. I would not recommend this and further, not order any other from that company."
5,provides great sun protection and value,We have used this sun screen for years even though it is hard to find (except on Amazon.com!) It goes on easily and provides great protection as well as a very goo value compared to the continuous spray sun screens. This bottle will last probably 10 times longer than one can of the continuous spray. Great for applying on squirming kids who hate to stand still for sun lotion. I only wish it came in an SPF 50.
1,WTF?,"So, finally received this item and it was only 1/2 full. It was covered in oil, and smelled terrible, like it had gone bad. Honestly, it was going to cost more to send it back than just get rid of it. Overall, uber bad.h."
1,Sticky and filmy,"I picked this up at Kmart and tried it at the beach. It left a sticky film on my skin. I had also sprayed it where I part my hair so my scalp wouldn't burn. Well, my hair was stuck like glue or a ton of hair spray. I took it back to the store and I'm still looking for something I like."
4,Pretty good solution for scalp burn,"I'm a soccer referee, so I spend a lot of time in the sun, and I cannot wear a hat (not part of the uniform). My hair is a little thin in the front and back. A couple sprays of this product on the exposed spots and I'm good for a few hours. It doesn't make my hair flat and greasy. It's sort of like hair spray might look in your hair, but it's not quite as rigid. It works pretty good."
1,AWFUL! DO NOT USE!,"This product is awful. After using it last weekend, my husband ended up having splotchy burns all over his chest. I thought it was odd, and figured maybe he didn't apply it evenly. Today we went to the beach and we went out of our way to make sure we were applying it liberally and evenly. Came home this evening and we are covered in splotchy burns. Its like half the bottle is just water or something. This is just dangerous, we used sunscreen to avoid burns and cancer, and instead we're covered, we might as well have used a spray bottle of tap water."
5,Great sun product,"We love it as it's not greasy and easy to apply. With being out in the sun for golf, it's perfect for my husband."
5,good product,"I just love the fact it is a spray and fast drying. With 3 bouncing balls for kids who just never seem to be able to stand still, it is easy to get on and they are willing to have a regular repeat of the treatment. The aerosol can spray seems to run out much faster than this one. It protects well."
4,Great for hairy guys!,"Being a hairy guy, it's a lot of effort to spread a cream over my legs and arms (and it's futile to attempt my chest). However, this spray comes out as a fine mist that gets past my hairs to the skin. So, a spray and quick rub is all it takes. I still use a cream on my face because the alcohol base can sting (particularly after shaving).Effectiveness: I'm a pale white northerner living in Miami. This stuff works.Value: I find that a bottle last much longer than the aerosol sprays.On-Skin Feeling: significantly less sticky/greasy than creamsDownside: when the bottle starts to get empty, it has to be upright to spray (which makes doing your own legs more challenging).Living in Miami I have to sunblock year round and have tried lots of different sunscreen products. This has been my fave for the last four years."
3,Not the best,"I ordered this as well asBull Frog Sunblock, Surfer Formula Gel, SPF 36 5 fl oz (147 ml). Besides a better price point, I've found this product wanting in comparison. With the mist spray, I feel like it's much harder to get even coverage than with the gel. The texture isn't just as nice either, and despite actually using both with the same frequency, I've found that I need to use much more of this to feel like I get even coverage. I'd highly recommend the Bull Frog Sunblock instead."
1,Not Close Captioned?!?!?,Gave this to my mother for Christmas as we really enjoyed the series when it aired on PBS in 1980. Seems I remember the series was Close Captioned for the hearing impaired. This DVD set is NOT.What a sad waste.
1,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE,"I forced myself to watch the entire first episode to see if it would get any better, IT GOT WORSE!!! The picture is also very grainy as if it was from the 1920's. Lots of shouting, angryness, sort of dark enviroment. If that is enterntainment for you then this is for you. Definitely not for me."
5,Flambards DVD,"I also saw this on PBS may years ago and loved it then. Found I still do. It's the kind of programming that doesn't happen anymore and most likely never will. Probably beacause of the expense and the extraordinary time length. It is long. The person watching would have to be as religious about carving out time to view it as I was. But I don't mind the lenght because I think it helps make it true to the book. And that's important to me. I have never seen a remake of this. So, I love owning the DVD because I know I'll see it again and again."
3,"Beautiful engaging series, but DVD quality is poor","I was very disappointed in the quality of this series on DVD. The picture was very grainy and the sound was uneven. When you are used to top-quality DVDs with a sharp picture and rich colors, this is quite a letdown, and very distracting."
2,DULL with a capital D,"I could barely give this a 2 star rating. The story is so very dull, the characters are flat and uninteresting. It seems to go on for hours and hours with nothing really happening. I hung in, hoping that things would change and hoping to at least get a small amount of enjoyment after the hefty price of the set. One of the most annoying things about this series is the HORRIBLE sound track. Completely eerie, weird and inappropriate music plays throughout the film. I started to mute it whenever a new episode began, just to get through the credits. If you like early 20th century airplanes OR horses, go for it. But if you want an enjoyable series pass on this one, I wish I had.Check out ""Larkrise to Candleford"" or ""Cranford"" or anything by Catherine Cookson."
3,Quirky But Grows On You,"I think quirky is the first word that comes to mind when I think of Flambards. I love the time period of 1902 onward. The costuming and the interiors/exteriors are top-notch but that silly music that the other reviewers mention is indeed annoying and is so irrelevant to the storyline. I was not watching PBS and British dramas in the late 70's so I am not familiar with any of the actors who star in the series. I am surprised it has not been re-made since it has alot of potential with the right cast and a better soundtrack. I am on disc three, so I am anxious to see how it wraps up. The music really ruins this in my opinion since it sounds too contemporary for the time period. I prefer Monarch of the Glen or Berkeley Square which are both well written and acted without the awful music."
4,Flambards,"Enjoyed this series when it came out originally. Great cast and story. My sons were in their early teens when this was shown here in the U.S.A.; now in their 40's, both have asked I share the DVD with them, as they too remember liking it. Both feel they will enjoy it even more now they are mature gentlemen. We have all been haunted by the various melodies for years."
5,"A captivating, sensuous CD!!","David once again takes jazz to another level. This CD will take you out of the world you are in and to ecstasy. This entire CD is so great that I had to play it over and over. Sit back, relax, and get ready for a great experience with David."
3,"I used to believe David when he said he was not a ""jazz"" guy","Then , i had opportunities to hear recording such as this one (before buying) and ANOTHER HAND . David certainly has his own lovely and soulful voice though . Some folks might not call this ""jazz"" . They may be correct . With folks like John Purcell (bass clarinet , alto flute) , Randy Brecker (trumpet) , and the late Don Alias (percussion) , i'll take my chances though . No , it's NOT strait ahead/traditional jazz . I like it though . Pino Palladino (bass on one song) was great all over Joan Armatrading's THE SHOUTING STAGE . Will Lee (bass on one song) was killin' all over Gary Burton's REUNION with Pat Metheny , Mitch Foreman and Peter Erskine . Call it what you wish , i got me a copy . Does need some acoustic piano though . Soulful ."
5,Kawabata's Best Work,"This is arguably one of Kawabata's best works. After reading and rereading it over many years, my admiration for Kawabata as a writer only increases. There is something so comforting about the domesticity in this book, despite any problems in the domestic landscape. The style of the book and the writing is pure genius. It captures the essence of the lives it portrays like poetic prose. There is zen in the simplicity and the structure of this book. It makes you want to get up and move to Japan, or at least visit. It makes you want to learn Japanese so that you can read this beautiful writing in the original, even though the Sidensticker translation is great in itself. I'm still thinking about what the sound of the mountain could be. Kawabata is the apex of world literature, and this book is very highly recommended."
5,Impressionistic art,"Written by Kawabata sometime between 1954-59, it is obvious from this work of art why he won the Nobel prize in 1968. He accomplishes the telling of ordinary domestic life in pictures of words, not unlike a form of expanded haiku. The Japanese aethetics of simplicity and nature are so well described, at times I did not know if I were reading or in an art museum. ..."
1,beautiful but can't get past the sexism,"The aesthetic details of nature is poetic, the book is full of nuances. Full of existentialist narratives, I really appreciated the subtlety, but I can't get past how Shingo treats his daughter in-law like a concubine/servant. I must have counted a million times where he tells her to fetch his slippers or robe or whatnot...then when his son's mistress is pregnant, I get the vibe that he's more concerned about his rep and his grandson being born illegitimate, rather than the welfare of the woman and about to be single mother, who by the way was abused by Shingo's son, and Shingo seems almost passive to cast any reproach. And his constant thoughts of how his wife is not as pretty as her sister, how he settled for second best, and how his daughter looks even uglier than his wife, it's no wonder how disgruntled and indignant his daughter acts.Apparently, many things were lost in the translation, maybe a new edition/translated version should come out..."
4,a good piece of common-sense,"Gives an insight in mindset of a succesful investor/trader and quite a few original perspectives about the stock market. Highly recommended, even if sometimes sounds like a generation old."
2,Outdated and misleading,"I have to warn all readers of this book that its methodology is either outdated or just simply not working. As a regular investor, I don't think you can gain any insightful info out of this book."
3,Zweig's Indicators are Not Infallible,"Even though Zweig's prime rate indicator has performed well in the past (giving excellent buy/sell signals); it would not have kept you out of the recent bear market. For example, using this indicator alone (which Zweig recommends you can do), you would have been invested in the market on February 1, 2001 (the last buy signal). As a result, you would have suffered the market's incredible drop (as the sell signal never occurred). I haven't backtested his other indicators (or super model) on recent market data, but, I am assuming that these indicators also failed (please let me know if I am wrong). One never expects 100% accuracy, yet, on the otherhand, you want an indicator to do its job when its necessary. Conclusion: technical/monetary indicators are not infallible, not even Zweig's."
3,Kind of dated....,"...Martin Zweig had a good run and then (as with most stock market ""gurus"") his investment ideas sort of lost their magic. This book isn't terrible, but neither is it the best. If you are interested in investing, it's worthwhile to read, as you will gain the benefit of seeing how Martin Zweig views the markets.Nothing in this book really stuck out for me (except for his ideas on the importance of The Fed to the markets)... that's just the kind of book it is. Not to take anything away from Zweig, but ""Beating the Street"" by Peter Lynch is a much more useful book."
5,Great Tool For Every Investor,"I enjoyed this book because Zweig takes you step by step through the development of his models. He discusses why each factor is important and how it contributes to performance. The model continues to work twelve years after he published the first edition. The section on stock selection is not great. I think other books provide more detail and evidence. But the heart of the book is about identifying trends. For that part, Zweig deserves five stars."
3,Some filtering needed to get to real value,The book is good. Not for Every Investor but may be for Every American Investor which is actually stated in the title. Certainly some parts can add real value to ones investing strategy somewhere else in the world. Sticking to the rules laid out in the book you will perform better than others during bull markets (but not necessarily outperform) and what is important you'll outperform during bear markets. I found the most valuable the chapter about market centiment and croud psycology. Anyway the book is not a waste of time at all
3,Wonderful movie but sound bad,Excellent performances by top actors are marred by a poor sound track and poorquality reproduction
2,Nice but too delicate,"I bought this necklace for my granddaughter. When I received it, I took it out of the box and it had two knots in it. I worked for a while and was able to remove one. Kept having a problem with new knots. Finally gave up and returned product. The necklace was nice enough but the chain is much too delicate for a child."
1,Very disappointed,"When I opened the box I actually thought they forgot to include the pendant in with the chain. Then inside a tiny piece of tissue paper was a microscopic pendant. Considering I just purchased a cross from Ireland twenty times the size of this for only $20 more, you know this is going back. This is even too tiny for an infant."
3,Not What I thought,"I thought this was the necklace that went with the Silver Slippers book. The pendant (ballet shoes) is so small you can hardly see it. It looks to be less than a 1/4"". I was very surprised."
1,Ballet slipper pendant,"Returning today , the pendant is less than 1/10 of an inch in size . decent quality but very very tiny"
2,Ballerina Slippers charm,I was not aware how tiny this charm was so I was disappointed. I am not sure my 4 year old niece will know they are slippers.
4,perfect for a little girl,"my grand daughter who is 4 loved the story of the silver ballet slippers and is really into ballet, so she was thrilled to get this necklace. It is very small and dainty and would not work for a bigger kid. It looks a little bigger in the picture than it actually is."
3,mehhh,This was not as good as the television show but was fun to watch the similarities. Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
3,Not on par with the book,"OK, as it stand alone, it's a good film. However, the book remains one of my favorite books of all time, and my expectations for the film may have been too high. The acting by all of the characters is good and the story is solid, but I just don't think the screeplay adaptation worked like I hoped it would. Whereas I found myself unable to put the book down, I wasn't tied to the room when watching the DVD. Good, but not great."
1,Disappointed,"I have to agree with D. KirbyI had just finished reading the book and thought what a great movie this would be; I don't know why hollywood changed all the facts. Besides getting the players name correct, they did not have to change who they beat and lost to. They only had Permian playing one correct team in the playoffs. Permian was not even in the state championship game that year. Also check out, during the Midland Lee game, the scoreboard shows a Bank Of America logo and then at the end of the game, they show the scoreboard again and it says NTNB.You will like the movie IF you did not read the book."
3,pretty good,"i finally got to see this film recently&I thought it was done pretty good. some of the directing shots where a bit much in spots&the film ran into familiar territory with other football films.Texas Football no matter if it's Jr High/middle School,High School,College or Pros it's all taken very seriously.this film captured that.the talk back radio then was something else imagine that the callers of today? all very real&also the realitys of what goes down within a team&Expectations."
5,Great!,"This movie was just great! Although it seems to be in the same catagory as other teen sports movies, this one goes beyond the same old script. I think what captivated me more was the fact that its a true story that took place in Texas and being a Texan it just got my attention! I'm not into sports at all, especially football, but this movie was more than that. The actors do a great job of making you feel like you're a part of their small town and you feel like you can relate. Overall i think this movie is Awesome."
5,Better Than The Book,"This is a great movie for football fans and non-fans alike. The casting is great . I loved the book and movies are not usually as good as the book but this one is. It captures the essence of high school football as to how it is revered and worshipped in some places, this place being West Texas. The casting is magnificent. Billy Bob Thornton, as the coach, and Tim McGraw, as the father of the one of the star players and a former star player himself, are top notch. It keeps you riveted to the screen for the entire 2 hours."

3,Predictable,"I watched this movie after hearing a review saying it was one of the top five sports movies of all time. I'm not sure what I was expecting, because it's hard to imagine how fresh a story a football movie could have, but this one poured on the cliches on top of each other.The ending with the abusive father was completely unbelievable (in the literal way, not the blown-away way) and the rest of the movie just fizzled out at the end. There was very little character development, and I didn't get a sense that this was a real 'team'. Billy Bob's performance was mediocre for most of the movie. He turned this around completely for his ""perfect"" speech, which, in my opinion, is one of the most motivating speeches I've ever heard, and which I think might justfity watching this otherwise completely unremarkable movie."
4,Great movie!,"I love the Friday Night Lights tv show, and had always wanted to see the movie. It was different, but also excellent. :)"
2,This movie was hella weak,Friday Night LightsI did not like this movie it was really slow and there was nothing interesting. This movie was mainly about some high school kids that were trying to win in the championship. The movie had a few good parts. The movie was crunchy (weak). I thought it could have been a lot more interesting. There was a father that was really cruel and was beating his son to make him keep his only focus on the football playing. It was not as enthusiastic as I thought. You will be wasting your money if you decide to buy or rent this movie.
2,More Like a Documentary than a Sports Movie,"Watching this movie, I felt like I was watching a documentary of a High School football team rather than a Football movie. I was very dissappointed because of all the hype around it when it first came out. The only story I enjoyed was the kid who couldn't hold on to the ball and his alcoholic father, now that was movie making. If you love football, this is probably a movie for you to watch. If you are like me and just want to watch a good movie and are so so about football, I don't recommend this movie"
2,2 stars cuz i like football,"I gave this film 2 stars because I like football. I ordered this on InDemand Pay-Per-View. Half way though the movie, I looked at my fiancee and said...do you remember ""remember the titans."" She just laughed. The plot is the same thing minus the race issue. Football team comes from behind in the finals while losing their best player.Remember the titans?"
1,"Terrible quality, unable to keep","Previous reviews made this company seem reputable, but when I got my dvd it was scratched, the audio and video were so terrible I couldn't keep it and the writing on the package was half in Spanish.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER"
1,Disgusting and Boring . . .,"I am sorry. Maybe I am not a sports fan, or maybe I just don't like being sea-sick at th movies. But, this movie made me crazy.The camera jumped all over the place and I thought I was going to lose my dinner, instead of just $10. I finally left an hour in.I have no idea how it ended, but frankly Scarlett, I don't give a d*mn!"
4,Surprisingly deep,"This was a surprisingly good film. It's subtle, and in a way it's not really about football. It's about the role of football in the lives of young men who don't have the oppurtunity for other moments of greatness in their lives. These Friday nights in their highschool years really are the best days of their life in a manner of speaking. It's their shot at immortality within their community. Afterwards, they take off the uniform and step into life as normal guys, lawyers and blue collar workers, single dads and car salesmen. I found this to be a surprisingly deep aspect of the film, one that I hadn't expected. I also think Billy Bob Thornton is great. He's one of few lead actors that knows how to be in a movie without hogging the lens. He's just a wonderful actor who knows how to be understated, when to step up front and when to blend back so that he brings out the best in other actors. Very good stuff."
4,I was impressed,"This film ended up be much better than I thought. The story centers around a Texas high school football team and their hopes for a state championship win. Trouble ensues when star player Boobie (how'd he get that name?) injures his leg. Pretty good performances and scary to think that people can get so carried away with a game that it rules their lives. Then again, this is Texas so what else do they have to do with themselves?"
3,Friday Night Lights,TV series took the best of this movie and made it better. Don't bother if you are a fan of the series
2,it's ok.,This movie is no were near as good as the tv series. If you want real footbal drama watch all the tv series seasons.
4,Movie Review,"Texans love football, high school, college and the professional levels. Friday Night Lights is a tale about a coach a star high school athlete and his teammates and his family. The movie is alos a tale about growing up in america with a focus on Texas, the ups and downs that are experienced in life and growing up. The movie show how the luxuries in life can cause heartache and pain."
4,"Good Movie, but...","Friday Night Lights the movie was very good in portraying players like Mike Wincell, Boobie Miles, Don Billingsley; and coach Gary Gaines. I believe the movie also portrayed the fans of the Permian Panthers execellently as die-hard, crazed football fans. But other than those portrails, the movie failed to touch on much of the story. The movie failed to touch on the history of Permian, as well as the future for the team. Without all the info, this movie is basically just a bunch of kids playing football with a bit of drama on the side. Still a pleasant story of a town and its high school football."
3,Fair bit of Football,"Friday night lights this is a story of High school football that stops the town. The pressures put on children and the social pressures of a town where everyone knows everyone and football rules. Likeable characters and a moving plot make this a great sports movie about hardships, mateship and sport."
1,lights out,this movie is so bad it isnt funny-- anyone who can sit thru this and enjoy it must be brain dead ! no character development no real plot-- no one u care about- dumb camera work totally unsatisfying ill conceived nothing to work with no point no drama--no pay off---- just gets worse and worse until u realize watching paint dry is more interesting !! its too bad about decent actors like billy bob--- so few good scripts-- these hacks need work and pour themselves into empty vessels like this---it was a bad year for movies but this is right there at the bottom ! of all the things ive seen recently a movie called my architect stands out the most--- its a revelation ! the opposite end of the spectrum from this dreck- i only mention it---to get the stink of friday night lights out of my head !! u wanna see something worth sitting thru-- check out my architect !!
4,Friday Night Lights,"Where I come from high school sports in general was something merely for the jocks to participate in and rarely garnered any widespread interest within the school. Football games--except for the annual ""bowl"" game against our cross-town rival (eventually discontinued because of the traditional post-game brawl)--rarely found more than one hundred parents and students attending. So some of the meaning behind this film is I guess lost, leaving me more of a dispassionate observer than anything else. Still, I really found this movie to be quite fascinating, and a powerful and well-told story."
4,Exceeded my expectations.,"Having read the excellent book on which this film was based, I was apprehensive about what Hollywood might do to distort it. Author Bissinger addressed the topic of racism in that book, and my fear was that this would be the sole theme focused on by the film makers. However, to their credit, they made the movie about much more than that -- and when they did touch on the topic, they did so fairly even-handedly, showing from the comments made by some Carter players that racism is a two-sided coin.This movie is a powerful contrast with ""Varsity Blues"". That was an entirely forgettable movie because it dealt with fictional characters in cliched situations. ""Friday Night Lights"", based on true events, portraying real people at real Texas high schools, and showing the agony and ecstasy of the run for the state championship, was a memorable film."
3,"Movie OK, unlike book","Well, I read the book first and then saw the movie a few weeks later. The book focuses on the sociological aspects of the obsession with high school football, to the detriment of other things such as education, ethics, etc. The movie left out most of the sociology and kept the football. The movie was OK as a sports movie, but it was a big letdown to someone who has read the book."
4,The Real Act Prep,"I haven't taken the ACT yet, so I can't say that it helped me to become a genius overnight, but it has been helpful in giving me a feel for what the test is like. If you want to practice for the ACT,buy this book!"
3,okay if you don't already know this stuff this book won't teach it to you,this book is good if you have an idea as to what it is you are doing ie...remeber this stuff from hs some topics i remembered vaguely and this book doesn't spoon feed you anything you should already know it just basically let you know what to expect...gives you an idea thank god i got it from amazon b/c i wouldn't haven't bought it from barnes and nobles at the price they are selling it for !!!
5,A Must Have to prep for the ACT,"very informative in preparing for the act.strategies for taking the act, stress relievers, practice tests, (the answers and explainations for those tests), and other helpful information"
5,REAL TESTS!,"I rated this with 5 stars, because it gives three ACT tests that were used in the past, and I think it gives better practice to the student than ""ACT LIKE"" practice tests used in other books.Some study in their own way, but I think that all need to take the tests in this book, because it gives them a good sense of where they might be standing when their ""REAL ACT"" test taking time comes around!"
4,ACT book review,My son is able to use the book as a tool to know what areas he needs help in. It is a good diagnosis tool.I am pleased with the book.
2,act book,I didn't realize that that ACT book was an old version because if I had of known I would have never purchased it. So know I have to purchase a more recent book for him to study
5,The only ACT test that are real,"The Real ACt Prep Guide is fantastic. It knows exactly what is on the test and is the only prep book made by the people that design the test. The others are all ""What they THINK the test will be like"". A winner!"
3,ACT,"I needed a 32 on my act score, and got a 31 before, so I checked out a few books from the library on ACT test review. I found this book helpful because it gives you actual tests, and has more tests than most ACT books come with. But, it does not give you the most helpful hints on how to become better. I would recommend Kaplan or Princeton Review series ACT books to help you get better at the ACT. I would recommend this book after you have studied these tips and would like to practice the timing and see what your score will most likely be."
1,Disappointed,This book had considerably more wear --- original owner's writing on pages & completion of most worksheets & tests --- than described in the item condition description. Lesson learned..... I'll never buy a used book sight unseen again.
3,Not good for kids with ADHD,"I tried to use this but the book was super thick and I just couldn't get into it, I used an online interactive study guide instead and I scored a 26 on my ACT. My sister did well with this book, the only difference between us is I have ADHD and she doesnt."
1,not for honda civic 2006,"First of all the delivery was late - they lost the package and they had tosend it again.It turns out that this filter is not for Honda CIVIC 2006 (like it was posted in amazon.com )Honda civic 2006 requires one whole piece of filter,and the one that I received is with 2 pieces and they don't fit for this model.I am very disappointed ."
3,Tommy Gun Lighter Review,"Well you know this thing is tiny, I don't think that I ever use it to shoot someone, but it's got some weight to it. I gave it to my step-father as a gift, he collects lighters.My brother still has a lump on his mellon from where it hit him.."
3,Blotches,"I was thrilled to get this flag for my classroom, but when I laid it out, there were light red blotches (looks pinkish) on different parts of the flag. I'm guessing the red ink bled through. I didn't have time to return it because I needed it right away.This flag is made of thin material, so it's definitely meant for indoor display only. The good thing is that you can't see the blotches when you first walk into the classroom, but as you get closer to it, it's pretty apparent. Remember, you get what you pay for. Otherwise, I was happy with the shipping and happy to have this hanging on my wall. I just wish it didn't have the blotches on it."
5,tons of nudity,i dont know about art but i know what i like and i like this movie in the first hour there is full nudity about every three minutes tons of nude women then the plot kicks in and the nudity slows down pound for pound this women in prison has more nudity than any other women in prison movie ive ever seen and ive seen lots if you are looking for a good plot there are better chicks i the slamer movies but if you want lots of naked girls get this movie
1,One for the dustbin.,"If you like lots of nudity then you just may like this movie.However,if you are looking for some sort of storyline with a decent plot you will not find it in this one.The acting is atrocious with the cast doing little more than reciting lines in many cases.Definitely one for the dustbin."
2,Weak girl/girl scenes in an otherwise lame video!,"I guess back in 1980 this one was groundbreaking, but today it comes across as a very so-so women-in-prison film. The scenes involving women with other women are disappointing and not at all erotic. Yes, there's some nudity, but not much else. There's a lot of violence, but it's mostly stupid stuff that is supposed to look real but looks pathetic instead.There's one interesting scene near the beginning where the female warden entertains a wealthy woman, showing her a pretty female inmate she can purchase for her own pleasure. A great idea, but later, once she actually owns the girl, their scenes together are bland and unimaginative. And finally, after the girl has tried to run away one too many times, she drowns her in a really fakey scene on the beach. Like I said, unerotic and pathetic."
4,Turn It Off Halfway Through,"This movie starts out excellent (lots of naked women all the time) but loses a lot of steam when the escape planning starts. Guys especially won't like what happens after the lead women escape. So as not to spoil things, let's just say that guys' ""members"" don't get treated very well. But the part before the escape is very watchable and enjoyable, with lots and lots of naked women all over the place and plenty of girl-on-girl sex. I enjoyed this movie a lot, up till the escape. Definitely worth getting for solo watching pleasure."
5,BARE BEHIND BARS,"I have the R1 Blue Undeground dvd of Bare Behind Bars and the film hasn't looked better. Anamorphic widescreen and UNCUT.BBB is far superior to other foreign 'Chicks In Chains' movies. The added porno scenes make the film more sexier of course, but it's a very good Women's prison movie in its own right.Now when is someone gonna release an UNCUT dvd of CHAINED HEAT with the sexy Sybil Danning and Linda Blair!?"
2,Star guy's review,Adult flick with a weak plot. Very typical movie of women behind bars. Not a film for anyone under 18.
1,Vocal Gems from OKLAHOMA!,The 1947 London cast of OKLAHOMA! recorded only highlights from the score arranged in 3-song medleys and spread over 4 78 RPM sides. You get sense of the story (wth the songs all out of order) and the performances - even the great Howard Keel - do not come across well due to the age of the masters. A curio for collectors who want every version of the score and possibly for Keel fans. Otherwise stick with the more complete albums. (WARNING: Total playing time for these OKLAHOMA! selections is about 16 minutes. Even with the bonus tracks this is a very short CD!)
3,Great Recording. It's all we have of this 1947 london cast,"I LOVE this recording. No, it's not the whole score here. It's more of a medley of certain songs with Dinah Shore singing other R&H tunes. I was surprised at how great the sound quality was for this 1947 london cast recording. Howard Keel is GREAT and is up to pare. Thank you Delta/Lazer light for releasing this 1995 classic great gem."
1,DO NOT USE,"According to the packaging, these are chef grade and FDA approved. I'd like to know how that is when it melted in my crock pot from doing a pulled pork dish. Nothing fancy, bbq sauce and pork. 8 hours high. I now have melted plastic in my brand new crock pot. I had better luck with Reynolds liners, they were much better...too bad I had to find out on the new crock pot, and not the old one.Buy another brand, or don't use any at all. The clean up is a snap any other way but with these!!!!"
5,Slow cooker savers,"Liked these so much I ordered two more packages. They are rectangular in shape and fit my 5-quart slow cooker with a few extra inches. Slow cooked a big pork roast for 10 hours and worked great. Made stuffed peppers sitting on a trivet inside the slow cooker saver, and that worked perfectly."
3,Performs as advertised,"These liners are as good as the ""name brand"" liners, and are only slightly less expensive, without compromising tensile strength. There are other liners available which are less expensive, and perform as well as these."
5,Synopsis,"The action-packed animated series ""Genesis Surviver Gaiarth"" focuses on the survivors of a planet devastated by war. In ""Stage One,"" the first video in the series, a small band of warriors team up to stop the evil General from destroying what's left of the planet Gaiarth. The heroic group is made up of: Ital, who was raised by an aging Warroid; Zaxon, a Warroid who suffers from amnesia; and the attractive cyber junk-hunter Sahari."
1,"Even at the price being offered, stay away",This Exxon Valdez of a DVD player blew out an audio circuit after 14 months of use. Up until it blew the circuit it played fine. I've had good luck with many Toshiba products (my Toshiba tv is nearly 15 years old) but I won't deal with them anymore.
3,display and sound broke after ~9 months,"The display and sound on this unit broke after about 9 months of fairly light usage. Reading the reviews on amazon, it seems this is not an uncommon problem for this, and other, Toshiba DVD players.However, a few e-mails, phone calls and faxes to Toshiba and they had it repaired for me under full warranty (no cost to me). Evidently it's a problem with the power supply -- a few capacitors had to be replaced. The shop did it while I waited. Thanks Toshiba for the good service!Other than that, the unit has perfomed fine."
2,Toshiba SD1700 lifespan shorter than warranty,"I got this DVD player for Christmas 2001, it worked great for the first 10 months. It being my first DVD player I had I started with only 3 dvd's. Now after 12 months and 19 dvd's only 6 or 7 will work in the player. All work on my dvd-rom on my computer and all are in excellent condition (no scratches), so the problem is not with the dvd's. When this happens on the dvd's that will not play the system locks up or if you are lucky enough to get it to the menu screen and actually start playing the picture has a great deal of digital distortion, you know the little squares showing up all over the place. Not something I want to see while watching a movie.I have contacted toshiba several times hoping to get some kind of customer satisfaction, 50% of my money back or best case a replacement, but no one will contact me back and I do not do call centers where on-hold h--l runs rampant and nothing ever gets done."
2,Sound Died,"Wow, lots of people having problems with the sound. Me too. Got my SD1700 Sept. 2001 and the sound went out in the middle of Shrek around Oct. 2002. Video still plays but no sound. Too bad, has some great features for the price but apparently can't last a year without failing. I think we only used it about 25 times!"
2,Poor choice if you plan on using for more than 1 year,"This DVD player lasted 11 months.The player worked great right up to the day it decided to stop working at all.Unfortunately as most people who bought this unit only 1 year ago are finding out when the warranty expires so does the DVD player.The player had loss of sound and LED display, which seems to be common for this unit after 1 year."
1,My Toshiba SD1700 Died 1-Year and 12-Days After Purchase,"--Read the previous 12/18/2002 review by Jeffrey R. Anderson.The *exact* same thing happened to me. I bought my SD1700 on12/16/2001 and it died on 12/28/2002, 12 days after the warrantyexpired naturally !!!!Just like Anderson, the front display on the player went blackand the audio output went dead. Piece of ..... After readingthe experience that Anderson had with Toshiba, I'm not going tobother pleading with them, especially since the unit is out ofwarranty.I hope that this review will be of help to future buyers."
2,Toshiba no longer top quality.,"My husband purchased a Toshiba SD1700 DVD player for me for Christmas of 2001. Today (11-23-02) the audio completely died in the middle of a movie my daughter was watching. We contacted Best Buy and they told us that they would ship it off for repair to save us the shipping as Toshiba had a 1 year warranty on parts. We were not told until we got to the store that labor was 60.00 hour....so, since you can now buy a NEW one for under 100.00 we decided to junk it. We have a Toshiba TV and VCR.I am very dissapointed in Toshiba that they too have jumped on the ""disposable technology"" bandwagon. It is also interesting to note that one of our home comptuers, an E-Machine, had a Toshiba DVD/ROM....that too died early and we replaced it with another brand."
1,Mine died too,Just wanted to add to the stories of people who got burned by this player. We bought this for my mother in law who used it a grand total of 4-5 times over the course of about six months before it died completely.The company really should step up and make this right for those of us affected but the likelyhood that they will without legal action is small.
2,2 out of 3 of these for Christmas presents died in 1 year.,My husband and I gave this DVD player as 'family' gifts. By the next Christmas 2 out of the 3 had problems; audio died on one and the video on the other. The third is hanging in there but we were disappointed.
1,garbage,"Just like 90% of the other reviewers, my unit worked fine for just over a year of light use (ie. for the term of the warrantee) before the audio failed. You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,I guess I should feel lucky,After reading everyone else's reviews I feel lucky that I was able to use mine for 2 1/2 years before the audio stopped working. That will be my last Toshiba product.
2,No longer satisfied,"OK, it's now 13 months after my purchase. This was a backup DVD player, and gets used a couple times a month at best. It usually sits on the spare TV and doesn't have much use. The sound has gone out completely. I've tried it on two TVs and nothing. Just out of warranty, too. Pass on this one and look elsewhere."
5,My first DVD player,"I am not very ""electronics"" savvy so I was a little nervous when I got this home. However, my fears were soon put to rest. It is very easy to set up and then it was ready to play. I am enjoying it thoroughly. I am sure it doesn't have all the features of a more expensive model, but for someone who just wants to enjoy watching movies, it is perfect, even for the novice."
4,Utilitarian.,"It's not expensive, and it performs admirably well at its appointed task, the playback of standard DVDs. It will also play audio CDs. There are composite video outs, though if you have a monitor/TV that can use these, I bet you opt for a fancier DVD player. There is a SuperVideo output for those who cannot use the composites (and RCA outs for those who cannot use either), good Dolby/DTS audio outputs for your sound system (or a simple RCA out if you're just going to play it back on a regular TV), and a few zoom levels and screen angles as well, but this is still considered a basic unit. In that, it will not disappoint."
1,freezes,The unit has frozen or jerked with several DVD movies. Purchased new from Sears. Will return before the post-Christmas rush.
1,Garbage Don't buy this product.,"This product should never had been made. I've only owned this DVD and it doesn't play worth a CRAP! It skips, doesn't play back cd-r, cd-wr. Hell it doesn't even play regular cd's without skipping. The remote control doesn't work either. I have be right in front of it for it to work and that is only some of the time. Sometimes I feel like throwing the thing out the window. Next time I'm buying a Panasonic or a Sony."
1,"Buy it if you LOVE PAUSES, SKIPS, AND FREEZING","I have had it less than 24 hours and it's going back to the store. Sure, the quality of the video and sound are wonderful but at what price? I couldn't watch a single DVD without hundreds of freezes and pauses, some short others 5 seconds long. Maybe it was my unit, but I've read about others having the same problem. no thanks."
5,An Awesome New Invention!,"The DVD system is AWSOME!!!! THe graphics are radical, the movies are played just as good as a movie theater. There are a LOT of movies to choose from, and you don't have to watch the pre-views! This DVD system is the best thing I have bought in a loooong while."
1,beware of toshiba,"Word of caution about Toshiba quality: I have a Toshiba SD3109 dual-disk dvd player; bought new mid-1999. Used it for 1 month, then it sat for 18 months in a closet, UNUSED, while I was on an assignment. When I got back, I got 4 more months of use - then it quit reading disks (repairman says the laser pickup failed). Of course now, warranty is long gone (even with extended warranty due to purchase with visa card - still have to pay $90 for labor; parts are another $95 that visa will pay). Rather disappointed unit only provided 5 months use. Reading other reviews at various on-line sites, other owners have also complained about Toshiba quality. Now looking for my next dvd player; I'll keep looking, excluding Toshiba. If you do buy, get an extended warranty."
5,happy,"This dvd player works great. Since I bought it, I havn't had any problems with it. Futhermore, I was watching the local news, and their ""product tester"" was reviewing dvd players(cheaper ones and more expensive ones) and he ranked this one the highest. `"
1,Problem with sound and dvd display.,"I'm having a problem with the sound on this dvd player. In order to hear it, I have to turn up the volume on the tv to as high as it will go. I've done everything I can think of to solve this problem including checking the hook up between my tv and dvd player and changing the audio settings. The dvd display on the front panel of the player also will not work. I've tried the FL DIM button on the remote as instucted in the owner's manual, but nothing helps. I just got the player in December and started having trouble a few months back. I'm seriously thinking about purchasing another dvd player, but don't know if I will buy another Toshiba because of the problems with this player that I've not even had for a year."
2,Toshiba DVD SD700,"I am looking at the other reviews on the player, and I totally agree. This player has a good price, but it regularly pauses, skips, even stops on DVD's. Even on brand new, never played DVD's. I took one DVD back to the store 3 times thinking it was the DVD.....but NO. I am truly convinced it is the player. It is very disappointing to get totally engrossed in a movie, watching it with friends, surround sound on and getting the full effect, when all of a sudden it pauses....or skips. VERY disappointing, not to mention embarrassing. I wish I hadn't bought it on-line. It would be easier to take back. I will continue to buy on-line, just not electronic products."
2,Buy this one ...If you want a headache!,"I received this player just over a week ago. Being my first DVD I was very impressed with the video/sound quality that the DVD yielded. However, I experienced some skipping in the first 3 movies that I watched (all of which were brand new!). During the third movie, the player locked up. I stopped the movie and began to play it again. The DVD locked up again. So I tried to take the movie out to test another one to be sure it was the player and not the disc. But the player's tray would not fully open. It opened about 1/3 of the way and then made an aweful grinding noise, then closed again. This occur over and over. It's going back where I purchased it for a better model. ..."
3,Great on MOST DVDs! (but not all!),"I've had this DVD player since Christmas. I got it as a gift. I never had a problem with it other than the fact if it runs through a VCR, the brightness will fade in and out. You have to run it straight through a TV and/or a stereo system.I never had a problem with it until today, that is when I finally bought the Korn DVD ""Deuce"". I ran home put the DVD in only to find that the bottem half of the picture is covered with a big green block while the top half is distorted and hard to make out. I did some looking into it and it appears that Toshibas have severe compatibility problems, and the new ""Deuce"" DVD will not work on any ToshibaMy advice to anyone is to not buy this, if you really don't want to spend a lot of cash, get a DVD rom from a well-known company, or buy a lower model from Panasonic or Sony. I may have only mentioned one DVD, but in my opinion a DVD player should play ALL DVDs, not just some."
1,Nice if it would last,"A nice DVD player when it works. As one other reviewer mentioned, on mine, the LED panel display and all audio functions ceased working in the middle of a DVD and remained INOP. All those having used it for less than 3 months might be in for a rude surprise."
1,Early death,This DVD player died less than a year from purchase. I didn't know it had died since it was in storage in my basement. When started up it played good for five seconds then the whole picture [ ] out.
1,Fundamental flaw (so does price really matter?),"I bought this unit and was very happy with it for the first two months - good picture, audio, and price. However it now stops, or freezes, my movies at various times while I'm watching them(I've recently seen others complain of this too). This is very annoying as it totally disrupts the flow and atmosphere of the movie. What good are the other functions (or even the ""good"" price) if the unit can't perform its most basic function. This is a fundamental design flaw. Watching DVD movies is great and I highly recommend it, just don't do it on this player!"
1,Its ok,"I just purchased this product two weeks ago. The picture looks great on my old Panasonic Tv. I don't like the fact that it does not play cd-r or cd-wr, but that is my fault for not checking into that before I purchased it. Also the remote control doesn't work that great. I have to be directly in front of the player for it to work. I thought it was the batteries, but when I put new ones in I still had the same problem. Should have purchased a Panasonic or a Sony. I'm really considering sending this product back and purchasing something else."
1,not what i asked for,i went to a site looking for a portable dvd player w/screen and i found one at a fantastic price so i paid for it . when i lokked at data for it a home dvd player came up and now i am having trouble getting ahold of the person who sold it to my via amazon.com....pretty bogus if you ask me. this is the first time i have bought something over the web..maybe i am stupid but i did everything that amazon told me to do.it was an initial portable dvd player w/screen model sd 1700. toshiba sd1700 home dvd player was sent to me.
1,Cheap fix for no sound or front display!! - Read On,"Check out [an online posting] noting which components need to be replaced to fix the DVD player. On mine, sound and front panel were back at 100% with only $...in Radio Shack parts..."
2,SD-1700 Sound and Display,"Purchased July 2001 and was very happy with the performance for the first 12 months. Then disks started getting rejected with minimal, if any, damage to them. In the past 3 months, the display has gone (leaving only the OSD) and the sound is close to silent. Look at the other postings, see the same comments. I was a Toshiba fan until this purchase."
2,"laid to rest on November 6, 2003","The sound is still there, but you need to turn the volume all the way up. Even then, it's barely audible. I feel terrible for nagging my husband to figure out what is wrong with the piece of junk. I received this as a gift but I will make sure to read reviews before purchasing a dvd player again. Do not buy this product."
1,Bad sound card,"I bought this model in 12/01 based on Consumer Reports recommendation, and initially it worked great. We moved to Japan in June and after hooking everything up again, the sound was distorted. Had someone look at it and he said the left channel was distorted from a faulty sound card. Cost to repair? $180!Thankfully, I paid for this with VISA, so I will be filing a claim through their extended warranty program. The repairman looked at the back of the player where it said ""Made in China"" and said that was the problem. If it's made in Germany or Japan, he said, then the quality is good.Perhaps overall, Toshiba does OK with repair ratings, but it's clear this particular model has some issues."
5,BEST Midrange DVD Player,"I purchased one of these DVD players 18 months ago, and recently bought a second one for use at another location. It is the undisputed best of the bunch when it comes to midrange DVD players. Picture quality is outstanding, and it performs on par with units that cost over $100 more. If you are looking for an economical DVD player - this is the one to have."
5,Good Unit,"It's a shame that some people have had defective unit's, and thus drag the rating down. I also read reviews and audioreview.com and it seems to me that a bad unit can come with even the greatest of dvd player's. I have had this DVD player for nearly a month and have been using it probably too much. Have watched at least 50 movies on it or so already, and have used it for long hours. I have not incurred one problem with it. Extremely positive review."
1,Mean Spirited!,I have but four words for anyone thinking of getting this horrible book: Get Roger Ebert's book instead
2,Bitter SWF critic seeks equally bitter SWM critic,"Is Pauline Kael married? If not, would someone please introduce her to critic John Simon. Since they are both pompous bores who hide their lack of knowledge concerning movies (or ""fillim"" as they would likely prefer to call it) behind mean-spirited sarcasm, these two should really be a pair. Kael knows as much about film as Brian DePalma does about originality (that's right, the man who built a career by feeding on the bones of Alfred Hitchcock is a second rate talent, as is Pauline Kael herself)."
5,Hard to find,"I have been looking for months to find this doll for my daughter. I even called Mattel and tried to purchase it from them directly, but they said the volume was too low. I am appalled that in 2004 I still have to spend as much time searching for African-American dolls as my mom did for me. Thankfully, I contacted all of my relatives and my aunt living in Charlotte, NC. found it.We need stores to request equal volumes of merchandise for all ethnic backgrounds. And for the customer who commented that the race doesn't matter - please be sensitive to the need of parents to ensure that our african american daughters grow up understanding that beauty is not always blond with blue eyes."
3,SHAME ON YOU MATTEL- Where's the African-American Primp and Polish Doll?,"I'm extremely disappointed in Mattel for not producing an equal amount of African-American Primp and Polish.I've been searching all over the internet for this doll and I've not been able to find it. I feel it is important that African-American girls learn self confidence and to appreciate our beauty. That's hard to do when all you see in the shelves are white Barbie dolls with blond hair and blue eyes. Not too long ago, my daughter came home from school and told me that she wanted to have blond hair. I can't even begin to explain the pain I felt hearing those words come out of her mouth. It is important to praise your child and tell them how beautiful they are. When I was younger, I felt unpretty because there were a lack of dolls that represented my race. It was as if we were beautiful enough to be considered marketable. It is 2005 and still manufacturers aren't representing every race equally. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!"
4,VERY HARD TO FIND-NOT ENOUGH IN STOCK,"This doll was very hard for me to find. It was in the sale paper which only show the caucasian version, which i feel is not fair at all. I finally found it in another state at a Wal-mart, which only had 2 on their shelves. I feel they should make the same amount of the African-American version just like the caucasian version. We live here too! Sandra, IL"
1,"This toy had great potential, but It loss its ""style"" when Mattle decided to use the wrong..........","The hair is made of a very unusual material. It is very hard to manage. Once removed from the packaging, this styling head is useless. The hair becomes a tangled mess. Mattle claims that you can curl it. My guess, that is probably why they decided to use plastic wire-like material for hair. The make-up doesn't work. I would not recommend this styling head. There are other Barbie styling heads that are made of synthetic hair(wig-like) that are more easy to manage, comb, and style. I would not buy any that have special features like curl or color."
1,Do not buy this styling head,"There is not a fun toy. I used my allowance to buy. The hair is bad and so tangled. You can not comb it or style it like on the box. I do not like this toy, it is not fun."
4,I'm very satisafied,"The styling head does exactly what it is supposed to do, especially the hair. The hair is wiry because it curls with the toy curling iron. If the hair was softer then it would not curl unless the child uses a HEATED curling iron. Why are most people complaining about the hair? It is doing what it is supposed to do."
1,Can't Rate It Because I Can't Find It,"I too cannot find this toy...it is irresponsible for a toy company to advertise a toy at Christmas time and not have enough to go around. I am looking for the African American Version also, but news is I haven't found any version. I have looked in Toys-r-Us, Walmart, Target and many other places...it is not even available online. What a RipOff. My Kid tells me this is her #1 Wish for Christmas. I will feel real good on Christmas Morning with no doll. Let's let Mattel know how we feel!"
2,Crappy Plastic !,"this dum toy!? Ya right!, i bought it and it had plastic strands of hair. If you ever run yur fingers through it,it will burn. truly i think that you should not buy this because i was very dissapointed in how the way it looked too! Near the picture it said african american ity even looked african american but when i got it you wouldn't belived how light colored it looked and the hair was sooo shabby that it would NEVER EVER seem like could comb it all the way through. It's not all what the customers say. I think you would be wasting yur money BIG TIME and i hope you find this reveiw helpful to you. LATER!"
2,Can't style hair,"I purchased this for my four year old daugter who loves to style her baby dolls' hair. We were very disappointed! The hair is wire!! It stays tangled and and cannot be styled. However, she enjoys the makeup aspect of the doll."
5,10 songs listed here,"1. 7th Avenue2. I'll Never Part From You3. Ponte4. Stoneman5. Do The Boogie6. Just Too Much7. Felicia8. It's Been A Long Time9. Put My Love Away10. You And IGREAT, I list the tracks and SOMEONE did not find this helpfu! WhateVER!!"
4,Beautiful and crisp prose from a much-missed author,"Carol Shields' strength lies in her ability to craft precise descriptions of moments... Her most interesting stories come from the first 2 vollumes, while the last collection felt more experimental and to me, somewhat less enjoyable. But her prose is always a pleasure to savour..."
3,Cute Story,Cute story although some episodes were simply not very good. Character development was okay and continuity of episodes were okay except for an episode about a girl that could breath fire that could have been from an entirely different series. I found the insertion of that episode to be sloppy. All in all this series wasn't bad.
4,Typical harem with a few twists to keep it interesting,"If you have seen any number of harem anime series, To-Love-ru (said like the Japanese pronunciation of the English word 'trouble') is a typical setup. One guy, multiple girls, some of which live with him, and the pervy male friend. What changes in this series is that the boy isn't interested in the 'main' female character. This adds more of an emotional appeal and less of a ""oh he obviously ends up with the main girl"" type feel. The series has room to grow (and has had two seasons and one OVA) so I look forward to seeing where they can take it."
5,Perfect book for the new Network Marketer,"There is so much to learn, psychologically, about building a Network Marketing business and Dr. Barrett does a wonderful job explaining to people how to deal with this. The concepts are simple to understand and extremely valuable to anyone who wants to stay the course in Network Marketing. I would recommend this to a beginner and a veteran of this industry, outstanding book! I would also recommend getting the CD or Cassette version so you can listen to it over and over again."
5,excellent,Most realistic book written on network marketing. A must for anyone in network marketing for the first time.
5,Excellent,This book is very inspiring for those involved in Network Marketing. It is also helpful if you are not sure you want to do network marketing. The book provides you a map to guide you through the process from meager beginnings all the way too super success!!
5,Daring to Dream,"Great book on multi-level marketing or MLM! Written by a MLM veteran, this has numerous tips and practical information on running the average MLM company from the comfort of your own home or small office. The information isn't specific to any one company but that increases its usefulness. Chapter 1 speaks about what to do about the ""fog"" encountered by so many at the beginning of their MLM experience and helps you through inevitable tough times you'll encounter. Later chapters help you navigate in MLM and stay the course to become successful. Very encouraging, informative, and practical. Well worth the low cost and the time to read, with an easy reading style."
4,Tom Barrett is good!,"It took a long time to get the book but since I'd read Success Happens, I knew it'd be worth the wait.."
5,Awesome,"I've applied these principles to not just my MLM plan, but also to life. Doors are opening everywhere. Dr. Barrett is a genius."
1,No! Don't!,"This cam only works in extremely bright light and does not focus well. I have experience setting up many types of cams and this one has been the worst. It is difficult to focus and the software is over simplistic and ineffective. I had 3-75 watt lights on in the room and the picture was still darm, grainy and out of focus. I cannot recommend this cam. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra 20 bucks and get a Logitec or Kodak. You will be much happier."
5,Web Cam,"Easy to install; no hitches. Good quality image. Altogether, no problems at all. Works great!"
1,Difficult to setup with Win 2000,"Well so far this webcam refuses to properly install under W2000.The Philips weekend?evening helplines are empty. So I am stuck with a camera that will not install and the instruction manual gives zero help in this respect. If Philips knows that this camera has difficulty to install under w2000, then they should not advertise it on the box as being compatable. Products in this day and age should not be this frustrating."
3,Is it compatible onder windows 2000 ?,"The cam won't work onder windows 2000 pro.Is that correct???So no,plz tell my what i dit wrong...Do i need a new driver ???"
2,bug...,hello i'm french your camera can't be install if I have a sound carde in my computer.can you send me an other driver to install it.thank you
5,Terrific!,"This is a wonderful recording. Cleo Laine (most famous as a jazz singer) is terrific, and Thomas Carey's version of ""Old Man River"" is a genuine showstopper. If you like Show Boat, this is the recording you want to have."
1,Series Finale What a Crock,"This is one of those times when the average viewer who likes a program and spends some,but not all of their time glued to every episode,wants to know that they have seen it, at least once, through to the end. Then because LIFE happens you know you never got to see how they ended it. Even in rerun,they very seldom run an entire series in order, through to the end, so I am reading reviews about Season 6 and how it wasn't as good etc. except for the last 2 episodes, you know the FINALE. Well, this will be the last time I don't do my homework as other reviewers stated. This is not the last 2 episodes and these 2 episodes are not even written well. What a needless deception and it puts a real bad taste in my mouth and wallet about buying any part of the Series. Catherine"
1,much better compilations available,"to get a good quality, single-disc collection of the original recordings of some of Merle Haggard's greatest music, ""20 Greatest Hits"" on the Capitol/EMI label is good, as is the budget cd ""Best of the Best"" also on Capitol (avoid similarly titled releases on different labels)...to really do Merle Haggard's legacy justice, easily the best single purchase currently available is the multi-label box set compilation called ""Down Every Road"""
2,Scimitar SL-2,"While I enjoyed the plot of a majority of Mr. Robinson's books I found the inaccuracies of the book to be beyond belief. An example would be a Harpoon Missile being used to shoot down a cruise missle.The Harpoon is a Surface to Surface or Air-Surface anti ship missile with a top speed under the speed of sound not an Surface to Air or Air to Air anti aircraft/cruise missile weapon platform which would have a speed in excess of Mach 2.Another issue is the fact the he would lead us to believe that the SAS, arguably the finest counter-terrorist force in the world, would fail to sucessfully investigate the background of an officer under consideration for joining the regiment.Mr. Robinson states in his book that he has numerous contacts within the military community and if so I would suggest that they be allowed to read the book before publication to correct inaccuracies such as I and others have detailed."
1,"Will drive the PC crowd nuts, but so bad it also drives everyone else nuts","As a staunch conservative, I enjoyed the idea of reading an enthusiactically anti-PC novel, since virtually all other novels these days are blatently and pathetically PC regardless of subject matter. But this novel was so full of errors, contradictions, and obvious mistakes that I couldn't make myself love it.On another but related point, anyone likely to read this novel has certainly read The Hunt for Red October. As such, any reader is likely to know at least a little about basic submarine warfare. I found myself continually exasperated with the silly way the rogue submarine was pursued (and repeatedly lost) and how ""passive"" sonar would ping and ""active"" sonar somehow was never an option. And don't get the idea that these were the worst holes in the story. This book was bad, really bad."
4,Barracuda Strikes Again,"I picked up Barracuda 945 last month, churned through it, and discovered the excerpt from Scimitar SL-2 at the end. Clever these publishers. I had to have this book. You'll note that I read books such as this one for pleasure and not for any other literary purpose, so my wants and needs are simple: entertain me.Unlike others, I enjoyed it. I'm not a student of constitutional law so I won't comment on that aspect. I found the plot believeable, and the characters enjoyable.You'll note that Robinson leaves the door open for a future appearance of the chief bad guy, General Rashood.I rated it 4 stars because the ending seemed weak in spite of all of the buildup."

1,BOTH SAD AND HILARIOUS IN AN UNINTENDED WAY,"I picked this book up in a used bookstore for a buck in hardcover, still a waste of money. I'm a minor fan of good techno-thrillers, those that have at least a factual basis. It's a good thing that laughter is good for the soul because this travesty kept me rolling and laughing. I read this while lounging on a beach in Oregon, almost caused a tsunami, I think. Previous reviewers have detailed many of the technical faults, so I won't go into them again. Other reviewers have mentioned the two-dimensional characters; one-dimensional is more like it. On a note not mentioned by other reviewers, the author in his Acknowledgements at the end of the book, wrote that he had the assistance of several former Special Ops soldiers and eminent scientists, all of whom he declined to identify. They must have read the manuscript before it was published."
1,"Bad, boring read!","For somebody who has read all of Patrick Robinson's work, I was thrilled with Nimitz Class, and emmensely enjoyed Kilo Class, liked the first half of HMS Unseen. From there on, it was a downhill run. Mr Robinson should clearly start writing about something other than submarines. Compared with his previous work, the plot is unoriginal, thin, and the characters boring, and hardly developed at all. In fact, his imagination was so strained that has re-visited topics raised in earlier works. If you want a really good read, pick Nimitz Class or Kilo Class. The rest are rubbish."
2,Part II of Baracuda 945 - Snoozer,"This takes over from where Barracuda 945 left off, sinking. Hey, we're going to blow you up, guess where. We'll even give you clues so you can catch us. DUH! Oh Patrick, you failed miserably with these last two writings. A big disappointment. Way too much emphasis on describing the characters, their idiosyncrasies, moods, and what they're frickin eating. I want action. If I want to read about food I'd buy a cook book. Change brands of that Scotch Whiskey, Patrick, and go back to your old one and write like you once did, with conviction. Hopefully I'll see it in Hunter Killer."
2,Umm Excuse Me...,"Are HAMAS that Stupid not to pospone their target date orginally set for October 9th. Just coz the GPS system was not working for them to luanch the missle from long range would not have put HAMAS in a panic situation to fire from close to shore where they were eventually ..... If I were HAMAS I wouldA) wait till the GPS were back on line and fire missle from long range.B) Not set a target date and have all the US NAVY and Patriot missles ready to obliterate me out of the water, ""Unless of course Pat intended this to be a suicide mission."
3,Good One For Techno-Geeks,"Good read, a bit too much detail about the technical aspects but if you like that kind of info, there's plenty of it here. The ending is a little fast (whole story unravels in the last 5 pages) & too obvious. Clancy & Cussler do better with theme development & resolution. Still, a good read."
2,I found this book boring.,"It started out pretty interesting, but there was just too much of 'the same' over and over.I did not finish the book."
2,a great disappointment,"I was very disappointed by William Golding's novel The Spire. Golding, whose most famous book is Lord of the Flies, tells in The Spire the story of an Dean Jocelin's obsession to add a 400-foot tall spire to his English Cathedral. All, including the builder, tell Jocelin that this is impossible, as the building lacks adequate foundation. Nonetheless, Jocelin persists, going mad in the process. While much of the writing and language of this book is first-rate, I found it difficult to either pay attention or follow the plot. I found myself rereading many parts of the book with no greater comprehension than the first time through. For me, this was one of those books which I was thankful was short."
5,good calcium-magnesium combo,"I like this formula. The price was significantly lower than my health food store, and an added bonus, the pills are relatively easy to get down. They're big, but because they're a capsule they slide. Delivery was prompt and I was glad to locate the brand I wanted on Amazon."
3,Overall good- but hire a copy editor!,"Overall I have enjoyed reading this book, much more so than the other assigned text for my Sociology of Gender class. However, as a student with a background in editing, I've often been jolted out of concentration by the numerous typos and spelling errors in this text. When reading academically, my goal is to read as quickly as possible while still processing the information. I've had to stop and reread multiple sentences in this book, such as this example on pg. 420: ""...although she acknowledges that the feet that she was known to be a graduate student..."" What, what, what? Feet? Stripper feet? Oh, I see, you meant fact, but you just can't write. Having spent at least an hour a day reading this text for class, the lack of editing makes my head spin. Proceed with caution in purchasing or assigning this text."
4,Very effective and thorough book to read,This book is a very good source to use when studying gender roles and aspects of gender. I like that this book has personal experience as well as scholarly reviews.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about gender studies and the changes that has been made to gender in today's world.
2,Manson: The 10 Version,"Hilarious, hysterical screed about ""hippies"", ""Manson"" and the decadent California subculture in the late sixties by a mysterious Canadian-Brit pulp author supposedly masquerading as a journalist. Wallowing in the kind of salacious, dime novel prose he so willingly condemns the press for using to create the Manson-as-icon, he takes on that annoyingly presumptuous ""voice of the characters"" style of journalism that hypnotizes mass market readers. Surprisingly, as a quickie-cash-in, the only factual errors he makes are very minor, but Manson scholars will find only silliness here and no one but pure collectors need consider it a necessary buy, unless you happen upon a 1970 1st edition of course."
4,The Best Star Wars Racing Game,"Super Bombad Racing for the Playsattion 2 is a incredibly good game. It`s graphics are really bad though. All the tracks are confusing at first, but when you play a few times, it gets better and better. You get to pick form 8 caracthers. There is also a secret caracther who you will race to unlock. This game is also a big headed cart racing game. You should buy it."
2,Great concept ruined!,"Luckily, I rented this before deciding whether or not to buy. And boy am I lucky that I tried it before dropping $50 for it.Well, everyone knows about the concept and cool graphics and all. The game suffered no slow down even with multi-tap on. But after playing for a short time, I realized how bad this game is. The controls are difficult, the power-ups are useless in a race (you need to use shortcuts to win). And worse, the carts move way too slow. The fun of any cart racing (ala Mario Kart or even Rumble Racing ) is that it's fast. This game felt like I was moving at snail pace.I wish that they would put Mario Kart on PS2 (though never happen) or someone come up with a true kart game. The closest out right now is Rumble Racing which is definitely worth the look if you're looking for cart racing type game."
1,Worst game ever!!,"This is by far THE worst game I have ever played on any system. I don't see how anyone could think this game is fun. The graphics are not good, the map would be better off not even there, and the glitches in the game should not even be an issue...but they are, besides the fact that the game freezes up, running into objects is annoying enough to make you want to snap your controller in half. Please don't anyone buy this game, and hope that they don't try to waste anyone's time with a sequel."
2,...,"I'm a racing fan, and star wars fan, so i rented this. I did not like it, but i played it a few years ago so i have no memories on this game. I do remember that the levels were filled with junk and the sense of speed was fast, so all you did was hit stuff. I did not like it."
3,"fast, fun, lots of weapons, nice characters, cool levels,etc","what is better than a racing game with good characters, like darth maul, anakin, jar jar binks, etc. cool levels, like podracer track, lots of weapons, and a fast and fun game? nothing, just four controlers and four friends enjoying this cool game. Well, this game is funny, cool, and fantastic, problably the best space ship racing gaming for the ps2, but there is a problem: very confusing and too patheticly wierd. When you crash just a bit, you ship starts spinning, what the hell is that? and worst of all the graphics are messy so you can't se very well. What can i say, like collecting star wars games? problably you will like this game, but if you hate messy and star wars games, don't buy this game."
1,what a let down...,I was looking for a good multi-plyaer game for my friends and I to play. This game was a huge let down. It just was not fun to play. It was boring. We played a few games and then gave up on it. I have not touched it since.
2,Stick to Mario Cart,"I to was looking forward to this game coming since I am a big fan of Mario Cart. Star Wars Bombard racing is a big dissapointment. The graphics are not that good. The background music, if you can call it music, is so annoying. The race tracks are uninspiring. I have only had it for about 4 days and I have allready offered to sell it to a friend. If you are a big fan of Mario Cart, pass on this game. If you are bored and have 50 dollars to burn buy the game."
2,what a disappointment,I was really looking forward to this game but I was deeply disappointed. The graphics were not good for a PS2 game on 4 player mode. The maps wass the worst. Some maps you can just plain get lost and are too big. What you want in a cart racing game is for it to be somewhat easy and have alot of interaction. You just don't get that here. Mario Kart still is the best one I've seen.
2,George Lucas Finally Failed,"I've never played a Star Wars game I didn't like... Until now. This game was horrible!! The controls were wacky, the graphics were choppy, and the soundtrack was no good. Watch out for this one!!"
4,"fun read, oscar winners, pop songs of 50s","Our club chose this book to study for this year. It had great potential for our music club to showcase our singers and pianists. After reading the book, I wrote a One Act play including songs that won an Oscar. Members of the club took the five parts to be spoken; others took the singing parts. I believe that this will produce an enjoyable evening for our musicians and those who appreciate music. Some of our members will not know any of the songs, while others will know most of them. The National Course of Study chair approved it and we're off to a musical evening!For someone just desiring a good read, this is excellent for anyone who lived any time between 1934 and 1956 - the scope of the book. It lists the songs nominated for the Oscar with some interesting details about each one, then tells the winner. All in all, it's just fun to read."
4,Good for new police wives/families,I have been married to a police officer for 8 years. I finally decided to read a book dedicated to police families to try to make sense of some of the issues that only a police family will have to deal with. This book was terrific!
5,Very Insightful,This book was very insightful. Though written from the Canadian Law Enforcement point of view the basic relationship barriers are still the same. I would recommend this to anyone involved with someone on the force.
4,A must-read,"I read this the first time when my husband was in the Police Academy. I have read it 1-2 times since then. I would highly recommend for anyone who's spouse is going into law enforcement.Becuase the author is from Canada, some of the scenarios didn't really apply to our situation, but Vali Stone has experienced a lot nonetheless. Her perspective helped me to prepare for the shift in our family."
2,boring,"Not what I expected at all. So boring it is hard to read. Nothing but complaining and whining from a cop's wife. May be enjoyable for spouses of police, but worthless for police officers."
1,Damaged Goods...,I bought this video for my granddaughter and we could not watch it because the disk was defective. The half of the movie that we could watch until it started skipping wss good.
2,Overrated Shirley Temple vehicle.,"I've only seen two film versions of ""Little Princess"": this one and the 1995 Warner Bros. version. I can say that the latest film is miles better than this one. As Sara Crewe, Shirley Temple is WAY miscast. But since 20th Century Fox had her as their studio prodigy, it's pretty understandable. However, I never though she could really ACT, and this film didn't change my perception of her. When she tries to display emotions, she simply overacts during her numerous crying scenes in the film. Thank God this was one of her last films as a child star. In the 1995 remake, Liesel Matthews gave a more realistic child performance, didn't overact during her crying scenes, and she made me believe that her character was in danger and somehow suffering. That's something Shirley Temple could only DREAM of doing [making the viewer believe her]. This film version can't hold a candle to the 1995 remake."
3,The Little Princess Shirley,Ok overall Shirley is really cute in this film and the technicolor is really good.I actually saw this video on Liketelevision online . It is really cute - but it's nothing like the book. It adds its own little twist and turns and they could have made it lots better. In the book I believe little Sara never cried and well Shirley did. I don't regret seeing this film or anything because i love temple movies but overall I thought this movie could have been much better.
2,Not My Favorite Shirley Temple Movie,"I was dissapointed with this adaptation, as it lacked the spirit and philosophy of the original. Sara Crewe, as originally written, was a thoughtful girl who never was mean to others, even if they treated her badly. The Sara Crewe of this video dumps a bucket of coal on one of the students of the school when she is angered. I knew then that this Sara in no way resembled the Sara I had read about and loved as a child.If you are a big Shirley Temple fan, you will probably like this movie anyway, but if you have ever loved the book, steer clear of this, as it does not do the book justice."
3,Shirley Temple Rocks!,"Little Princess was awesome as I remember, however I didn't realize that Heidi wasn't the original Shirley Temple version which I was looking for....but Amazon is great to purchase everything."
2,Not what you Think !,"This is not the Heidi with Shirley Temple in it !!! Don't' be misled to think both of these movies are Shirley Temple because they aren't. I feel it's kind of misleading. It would be one thing if it said Batman or something, but most people know Shirley Temple made a Heidi movie and assume thats what it is. Well it's not. Also the quality of this DVD is very poor, and no it's not my DVD player or TV. Lesson learned the hard way I guess."
2,Heidi is not Shirley Temple,I was extremely disappointed to find that even though this DVD is billed as Shirley Temple that she is only in The Little Princess and not Heidi on the same DVD. Clearly mislabeling and maybe even worse. The Heidi version is from the 1960's and is an unknown Heidi.
3,Not Bad,"Shirley Temple is adorable as always, and this film has some merits, but it is a poor adaptation of the novel. Too many liberties are taken with the plot--some things added, some things excluded, and still some more are altered in significant ways. If you like Shirley Temple or are interested in a classic, cute, ""feel good"" movie, then you will enjoy this. If you are interested in an accurate, or even valid, adaptation of the original novel, do look elsewhere."
3,Toothless adaptation of the beloved novel,"The Bottom Line:Though Burnett's source novel isn't exactly great (it pretty much defines ""poor little rich girl"") it's a very appealing and simple story, so it's depressing to see how badly the filmmakers of this version botched it; unless you're a diehard Shirley Temple fan (and even if you are, be aware she's at her most annoying here) watch the 1995 version before wasting time on this.2/4"
2,Not one of my favorites,"I really did not like this movie. Perhaps it is because I do not like Shirley Temple-- all her pouting and her annoying voice. Also, I preferred the Warner Brothers version much better."
1,The little princess,"I love the book ""A Little Princess"" and this movie is nothing like the book. The end with Queen Victoria just makes me sick. Don't buy this movie, but the 1995 version is good, i like that one, or read the book. Shirly Temple was a horrible actress for the part of Sarah Crewe, she was nothing like her. I don't reccommend this movie."
1,"watch the remake, please?","This is one of those few times when I like a remake better than the original of a motion picture. I'll confess that, based on this movie, I'm not a Shirley Temple fan (her voice alone is annoying, not to mention her acting ability). She is utterly unconvincing as Sara Crew, and that American accent! Please, can we stop making movies of British literature where all the characters except the main one are truly British? I know this is done so as to appease and appeal to the idiots on our side of the pond, but really, are we so uncultured and stupid, not to mension spoiled, that we won't watch a movie unless it has at least one American actor playing a prominent role? If I had to choose between these two movies, I'd definitely see the 1990's version of this one; at least there, all the characters are Americanized, so one doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. Lisel Matthews' performance is enchanting, and the movie all around is delightful."
5,I do wish that Hollywood would reinvent the innocent little musical,"""What a lovely movie. `The Little Princess' is a delightful story, and Shirley Temple is completely adorable. Sort of a David Copperfield for girls, and I mean that in a positive sense. I do wish that Hollywood would reinvent the innocent little musical."""
5,Shirley Temple's Best Movie,"This has always been my favorite Shirley Temple movie. I have the B&W VHS version, but this colorized version really brings the movie to life. It is excellent viewing for all ages and highly recommended. Thanks, Amazon, for the FAST shipping."
2,Review on Movie,"I love the book The Little Princess and I know the book very well. My daughter had to read the book so I treated her to the movie. I ordered a particular movie with a certain cover, unfortunately I didn't get the movie with the cover that I had chosen. This particular movie had points that are alot like the boook but the ending is completely different. It is very dissapointing when you read the book and it does not end the same. Plus the her french teacher in the movie is a lady and she is no where to be found in the book. The cover that I had chosen first I KNOW was alot like the book, when I got my package I knew immediately it would not be the same so I was quite dissapointed.. I watched the movie my daughter decided not to since the endings were different."
5,Couldn't Have Been Any Better!!!,"This is an amazing film that shows love, friendship, and respect. Shirley Temple was so cute. She played a marvelous Sarah Crewe. At the part when she was by the window crying to say goodbye to her daddy. It was sad that he had to go to war. Ian Hunter was a great actor too. Now for Becky played by Sybil Jason. She was one of the cutest and best actress I've ever seen. I like it when Sarah gave Becky a wonderful present, and Becky almost fainted! I also like it when she says, Oh no, miss. She is so adorable. I felt so bad when Becky slipped in the street with the police after her and Sarah just because miss Minchin thought that Sarah stole a bunch of stuff. But they didn't, Sarah thought her dreams came true. That caring indian that owns the parrot snuck in and gave it to her. Well, this was a great movie, and I'll never lose this VHS. Well, bye actors, and actress."
4,Shirley Temple Movie,"I have seen Shirley act at all ages and feel she makes a great transition from age to age,she never disappoints me."
3,Anita Louise's beautiful silhouette is my favorite thing about this movie.,"Having read the Betsy Tacy books by Maud Hart Lovelace many times, I instantly recognized the author's meaning when describing how slim Betsy and Tacy both were as if it were a rarity. Anita Louise's costumes are from the same period as the Betsy Tacy books and her figure is noticeably slimmer and the clothes look different from even the idealized fashion designer renderings. I'm not a fan of the Little Princess story nor of Shirley Temple but this is a well-done production if you don't take it too seriously. Miss Minchen's menace is muted for the 1939 audience but it is instructively chilling how she automatically uses endearments when Sara Crewe is still rich."
2,Disappointed,"I would call the platter a ""factory second"" with it having an indentatiion on surface in the flower border It is not one that I would have selected if I had a choice. The pattern is now discontiued so finding a platter in this pattern isn't easy, yet I think it's where they are now selling off the ""factory seconds"" here."
3,debut live,"so i wanted to buy one of Bjork's live albums the other day. I was leaning towards Post Live or Homogenic Live but when I got to the store, all they had was 1 copy of Debut Live so I got it, even though Debut is not my favorite Bjork album. This CD is about half and half, half is good, the other not so much. not because it's bad, but either a) the performance sounds too much like the original (anchor song, crying, Like Someone I Love..) or because I don't like the new way Bjork rearranged the song(Big Time Sensuality. It should stay a DANCE song). Also, I already had this version of Venus As A Boy on the Isobel single so that was pretty useless to me too. The highlights on here are Human Behaviour, Violently Happy, and Come To Me, which I hadn't really paid attention to before (the DEBUT album version) and wasn't one of my favorites but it sounds REALLY good here. It's probably my favorite track on here."
5,Critical story in JLA continuity,"Not since Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns do we get such an in depth look at exactly how far Batman is willing to go in his pursuit of justice. When his greatest enemy gets hold of his personal files on his Justice League teammates, the consequences spell catastrophe for the JLA. While not quite as good as some of Waid's best stuff, this story gives vital insight into the uncomfortable relationship that Batman has with the JLA. Tower of Babel is a vital story for anyone following DC universe continuity, with repercussions throughout the other mainstream superhero titles."
2,Extra stuff in the beginning and the end with the core story (middle) being overrated.,"I got this trade paper back because I have heard a lot about this story over the years and though I should read it before the animated movie based off of it came out.The trade starts with a story that while interesting on its own has nothing to do with the core store. After the core story is over there are a couple ""short story"" pages with some team up stuff that also has nothing to do with the core story.The Tower of Babel story itself felt rushed and not well thought out. Part of this could be because I knew the premise of the plot before I started, but it doesn't excuse the plot holes (mentioned in other reviews).I'd gladly give the Tower of Babel story itself a 3 star (although it be a low 3 star), but the fact that the compilation also had a lot of extra stuff just to fill out the book seems wasteful to me in a lot of ways. So it gets a 2 star rating."
4,A couple of glaring inconsistencies,"First, the weapons Batman designed that were used against the other heroes were incredibly complex. There is no way he would have had the time, expertise, and facilities to build all those intricate weapons. I know it is science fiction, but each of the super-heroes are defined by their own limitations, that's why you have a story. Otherwise Superman could just fly around and save everybody and Bruce Wayne could just finance reparations and they would live in a perfect world. This one pushed even comic book credibility a little too far. Also, the Lazarus Pits are used to regenerate Ras Al Ghul when he is nearly dead or recently dead, they should not have been much of a threat to Bruce Wayne's parents bodies. Other than that, the concepts of trust and betrayal made a thought provoking story. I do like stories that show Batman as the preeminent member of the JLA."
3,Biased,"Don't get me wrong. I love Mark Waid's writing, and on it's own merits, this is a good, solid story. Unfortunately, Waid has the unenviable task of following in the footsteps of Grant Morrison, who breathed new life into the JLA. I was a bit spoiled, and would HIGHLY recommend that you seek out the Morrison JLA books before getting these, or buying ""Kingdom Come"" and Waid's ""Flash"" books to see what Mark Waid is really capable of..."
2,boy boy boy,All i have to say is that i feel sorry that sweet nice Ben ended up with such a fickle and not too right in the head woman. I hope the author didn't think that this female character was realistic in thinking she needed to get married because she was pregnant. PLEASE!
2,Very Slow Paced,If looking for an interracial romance the cover is misleading. The characters aren't particularly interesting and the pace is rather slow. Not a bad read to kill some time but not the best romance out there either.
2,Confused about interracial romance,I was confused as to whether Ben was a white guy or a black guy.The book could have been written better.
2,Unrealistic,"Personally, I did not like the story, I thought it really did not have any substance. The female was so unsure of herself, and it almost ruined her life and someone elses. This is something that can be a problem in reality no need to make it a fantasy. I really lost interest in the story when the female character decided to have her baby although she did not love the father, then attempted to go through the marriage ceremony again. I don't think so..... that was a bit much...."
1,TERRIBLE NOVEL,"I READ THIS BOOK WHEN IT FIRST CAN OUT. I FOUND THE PLOT OF THE STORYLINE AND CHRACATERS TO BE UNREALISTIC. I RECOMMEND READERS TO SAVE THEIR MONEY. IF I HAD MY CHOICE, I WOULD NOT HAVE RATED THIS NOVEL 1 STAR."
1,"Dismal, Dismal","I was extremely disappointed with this book. A very poor variation of the movie ""Runaway Bride"". None of the characters rang true."
1,This book was awful!,"Admittedly, I allowed myself to be persuaded to buy this book by the cleverly marketed front cover. I really should have paid closer attention to the reviewer from North Carolina, and saved my money. The heroine was unsympathetic, and lacked dimension. It was unbelievable that a sista would wait until just before the wedding ceremony to run away. Weddings cost too much money for that kind of foolishness! The plot was missing in action, and unrealistic. To make matters worse, anyone that grew up in Chicago as I did, knows that you would never pick up a guy on the El (including Ben Stephens) and allow him to take you home."
5,From inside jacket,"from inside jacket""Ivy Daniels didn't intend to hurt anyone. She certainly didn't want to hurt her husband to be, Chicago's most desirable catch. But moments before she's about to say I do, Ivy realizes she does not-at least, not until she gets a chance to sort out what she really wants. With a little help from handsome stranger Ben Stevens, Ivy bolts the wedding of the year-only to find yourselves in the arms of the man who saved her....Then you Ivy needed help from the first moment he saw her. He could tell she was struggling with a big problem, and all he wanted to do is to help her through it. But soon, he finds her sweet nature in Steely determination captivating... And his good intentions give way too hot-blooded passion!"""
4,Good Read,"This latest book by Crystal Wilson-Harris was a good read. The story open with Ivy having second thoughts about marrying her long time boyfriend. In the process of getting away from the church her dress gets caught in the train and she is rescued by Ben.Ivy has a lot of things going through her mind as she tries to get her life in order. I believe this topic was very realistic. Many women and men face the obstacle of marrying the right person. And if the woman becomes pregnant, she has to decide if she will keep the baby even if she no longer loves the father of her child.I really loved Ben's character. He was very patient with Ivy while she was trying to figure what steps she plans to take in her life. All the while he knew that he was falling hard for Ivy."
5,Wonderful work,"Doonesbury is still the best comic strip out there. The only serious competition it had was Peanuts and Calvin & Hobbes, and they are gone.Doonesbury has warmth, humor, relevance, and sting. Get it."
1,What does this thing do exactly...,"Ok, I thought that all webcams did the same thing: u and ur friend on the other side of the world both are connected to the internet and have your webcams connected and can talk to each other live and see each other in a live video chat, at the same time, but according to the reviews it seems like all these things do are take pictures and take video clips which u can then send to ur friends. I don't need a video clip! I want a live video chat!!! do any of these actually do that!?!?!?"
4,"Quick and easy Mac set-up, great pix","I just got this camera and was able to set it up with my Mac Powerbook G3 without any hassles. The Mac software it comes bundled with (Oculus) is easy-to-use and has many great options -- I was able to start publishing pictures to my web site in a matter of minutes.It's also worth noting that third-party developers have created Linux drivers for this hardware, something which factored into my purchase since I also plan on using this camera directly with my web server running Linux."
5,Best Price Performance,"This is the third webcam I've installed so far and it's the one I'm most pleased with. While the price is mid-range, the performance is excellent (speed, clarity of picture). The installation is so easy, even my grandmother could do it.It also looks real cute, when you hang it to the laptop screen; like a little creature peeking over the edge."
4,closest match to AAMC practice tests,There are only about 5 real practice AAMC verbal tests. This is not that many if you need a lot of work in verbal. This book was very well-written almost identically to the style of AAMC questions. Orsay captures the subtle nuances of question stems and answer choices. There should be more abstract passages though.
2,A bit off....,"I love the Examkracker series, however this particular book is somewhat off from the real Mcat. A lot of these answers do not make sense, and a strong case could be made for numerous supposed ""wrong answers."" I don't understand how the writers came up with alot of these answer choices. The passages are also too easy to read. The real MCAT has its share of abstract and literary passages that are much more difficult."
3,not bad,"This book was pretty good for developing faster reading skills and gaining confidence but I think the questions in it were much easier than in the real MCAT. Therefore, use this book as initial practice, but attempt real MCATs to make sure your reading comprehension is really as good as this book tells you it is."
4,buy it if u have time to do it,its great but make sure u have time to go over it 3 times. go over the questions u did not get and ask ur self why
3,Very difficult questions,"Passages are easier to read than Princeton Review and AAMC tests. The wording of the questions is not as convoluted as the AAMC tests. However, the questions are very difficult to answer. Often times there is not enough information in the passage to correctly answer the questions, and it seems like there could be information to support more than one answer choice. While it's true that questions on AAMC practice MCATs 7,8,9 have many attractive 'trap' answer choices, this book takes that to the extreme. Therefore, I don't know if this is an accurate representation of the verbal section."
5,Practice Helps,The questions simulate actual MCAT passages very well. I recommend using this book to anyone in need of practice because it is the only way to really improve your score.
2,Examkracker verbal 101 passasges review,"Since the MCAT changed from an 8 hour exam to a 5 hour exam, this book has lost its relevance. It is not that helpful anymore because it does not reflect the AAMCAS structure or question type. It is far too difficult and irrelevant. They need to come up with a newer version where the verbal tests are 40 minutes each, the passages are shorter, and the questions at par with the real test."
5,OEM Replacement,This worked well as a OEM replacement. Installed with no problems in my old field beater Ford PU. Can't say more than if it works & does it's intended job: It's a great replacement.
5,Wiper Delay Switch,OEM Quality at less than half the price and quickly delivered to my home. OEM dealer did not stock and stated 2 week delivery. Amazon delivered in 3 days.
3,Martin Carr's brave side-project,"As the brains behind the music of The Boo Radleys, Brave Captain provides Martin Carr more artistic freedom, a wider latitude to experiment. His side project combines everything from Aphex Twin/Mouse On Mars electronica and Flaming Lips psychadelia, to ringing industrial clanks and the Dandy Warhols-type fuzz-pop. You can sense Carr's musical thought process here, dabbling in different genres creating a pastiche of sounds and styles. Yet the CD has an undercurrent of The Boo Radleys' quirky structures and melodic wispful sound (sans trumpets and shoegaze tendencies) Martin Carr almost seemed liked a restless spirit with The Radleys, an unconventional musical visionary making music on 'his terms', which continues with side-project Brave Captain."
1,Does not meet expectations,"I bought the 800 as a replacement for my 300. After properly charging it, and loading the music, I was off and running.Only problem is, it is not designed for anyone running as an exercise. The port on the top where you transfer music will capture sweat and moisture.Two days after charging the unit is dead, even if left in the Off position.Recharge it and try again....works awhile and then cuts on and off. Never more than an hour at a time.The leather case to carry it on your hip just rubs the skin off your sides.It's a shame that they moved away from a product with a solid approach for use by those exercising, to one that is so tempermental, you will learn to hate it"
1,Defective,"This product seems to be plagued with defects. I received a Rio 800 today. I was already an audible user, but needed to reinstall and reactivate devices to get it to work. I also had RealPlayer Plus. In order to get Real Jukebox to work, the installation program needed to reinstall Real Player Basic. I then had to reinstall Real Player Plus. Finally, the audio jack was defective, so I never did get the thing to work. I now have to go through a lengthy RMA process. Though I am hoping that it will be worth all the trouble I've gone through, my experience has been problematic.Update: I received my second unit, and this too was defective as it would not turn on.Another update: My third unit worked great for about 2 weeks. Now it has developed a problem that the battery drains, even without use. I will never buy a Rio again and the customer service people think I'm trying to scam them (though they have been nice)."
1,Failure out of the box,I was so excited to get the Rio 800 and an extra backpack for some trips is was going to take. But the charger in the extra backpack failed. Then the origonal backpack failed and fried the player in the process. It was quite a dissapointment. It asside from the buggy audio manager the player was great... while it worked.
1,Serious Recharging Problems and no support,"The product was wonderful for the first 3 months and the recharging socket broke. I could not get any support from their website, and had to dig throughout their site to get the phone support. They told me that the backpack was out of warranty. So I bought an 32MB expansion backpack. It was really cool at first, extra 32MB of space and it charged fine. Then 2 months later it quit charging. I called support 6 times. Twice they had no record of my calls, and I had to get 2 RMA numbers. They have been out of stock for 7 weeks now. No status. Impossible support techs that provide no help. Their email service doesn't respond but once every 10 days and it's of no help."
1,Do not buy this product! (Repeat) Do not buy this product!,"This is the worst Mp3 player on the market. After I recieved the Rio 800 for Christmas, I opened the box and it was the worst thing I had ever done!! When I had finished calibrating my player,I loaded it up with music. Two minutes later my Rio had shut itself off and I could not turn it on. My Rio was ruined because the Company sends each Rio with a defective charger. I trusted Rio for a long time. Now I am very dissapointed. If you are reading this review,don't buy this product! If you do,you will be very sorry that you did!!"
1,Don't be fooled by the Rebate!,Mine didn't even work when I took it out of the package! I guess thats good in a way because I didn't have to waste 5 hours of my life(the battery calibration time) to find out its a piece of (...)! No wonder they tacked on that nice little rebate..they're trying to get rid of them!
2,Great sound poor battery life,"Owner of two RIO 800s and both defective, although it is very versatile, handy, light nice ""look"" and worth buying,but they are too fragil. They Both have Battery problems. (They died out fast!!, really fast)"
1,Sell your sonicblue stock,"Was it a name change or did Diamond sell the RIO to sonicblue? I ask because I have a RIO500 which is great, but my 800 is not.Whatever the case, their RIO800 is not good. The battery is a joke, the sound starts off OK, but on my most recent unit after about 2 months (#2 after returning the first defective one), it now plays great metallic static but no music.Their web site is useless, and their customer service consists of an automated email reply which says they will get to your request in several business days (it's been 8 so far). Do yourself a favor and stay away from sonicblue."
1,Keep Looking,"If you want a great MP3 player, keep looking. The RIO 800 is NOT it. I owned the old Rio 300 and loved it. The 800 is unfortunately a couple of steps back and not worth the price. The first problem is the battery design. For whatever reason, the systems drains the rechargeable battery, even when you aren't using it. Disconnecting it from the player seems to help, but only some what. Don't expect two or three days to go by without needing to charge it. The second problem is the software. It is extremely difficult to use and they expect you to pay more for some of the features. There are much better versions available on the internet."
1,The Rio 800 really isn't worth the money,"Why? Simply, I've had my unit replaced three times, I'm on first name terms with a sympathetic technical support (who, I'm afraid, are only available 8am till 5pm with no toll free number), I've spent hours on this, but I still haven't had a machine that works. So, is the Rio worth it? No, but my time is, so I'm going to get my money back and look elsewhere. I suggest you do the same."
2,Buy the Intel,"Trust me, get the Intel Pocket Pro. I have both. Had the RIO for 6 months. Sent back once when it died. Finally got tired of the crummy battery not charging properly and the inaccuracy of the battery indicator.Intel is easier to use and it works.Plus it has an FM Tuner (listen to TVs in the GYM) and can support regular batteries instead of the pitiful battery architecture on the RIO.Trust me, don't buy this."
1,don't buy this item,I used it for 2 hour and this junk shut it down by itself andcannot be turned on again.lee
1,waste of money,i bought this last summer and it's just been a completely defective product. it's impossible to get anything resolved with the manufacturer when the product crashed and the customer service people are not responsive or sympathetic. i supposedly will be getting a replacement within the week (it's been gone for 4 already). i will not do business with rio again.
1,LISTEN to the Negative Reviews!,"Like too many others I thought I could dodge the quality control bullet, but I wasn't that lucky. After carefully following instructions to calibrate and charge the battery, the unit worked for about 45 minutes before it started randomly powering down. Also (though it wouldn't have been a deal killer if everything else worked), the display is truly difficult to read. All that said, it does sound great.I'm not making the same mistake twice, so I'm going to give the Nomad II MG a try. It's expensive for only 64MB of memory but it comes with a docking station, judging by reviews the FM tuner seems to work better than on the Intel (and you can record from FM directly into memory), and it's expandable using standard SmartMedia cards (unlike the Rio 800). Since 128MB cards will see significant price drops soon, you'll be able to expand the Nomad to a total of 192MB for not much more money."
2,A Disappointing Product,"My Rio 800 worked great for about two months, but after that short time, I have experienced a number of problems with it. I typically use the unit at the gym, and while it is lightweight and has a more than adequeate storage capacity, the negatives now outweigh the positives for me.The battery life, like many others have said, is poor. I typically get about three hours of playing time out of my unit before it fails. In addition, the player crashes at random, requiring removal and re-insertion of the battery pack before it will operate. On some occassions, this does not fix the crash, with the player displaying ""ready to download,"" and only replacing the firmware fixes the crash. In addition, many MP3s suffer in the transfer process, with annoying screeches and pauses being added.In all, I would recommend not buying this product and saving your money for an iPod."
1,Terrible RMA process,My player failed after 2 month. It is 3 month since I sent to Rio repair center. Player is still there. They are telling that new units are backordered and they still didn't receive any. But this is Rio own repair center. I figure that they don't care about existing customers and prefer to send new proucts to stores.
1,Fell for it again. SonicBlue = Quality problems,"I was told that the March version of the Rio 800 was fixed.Well, the battery problem seems to be fixed (so far), but now I'm having a problem with audio quality. All of my tracks (which play fine on my computer and CD MP3 player) are all garbled. I'm assuming this is a problem with the flash memory.I was a huge SonicBlue fan because of their innovative products, but their horrific customer service and technical support has changed my view. SonicBlue just doesn't seem to get it. I've sold all my stock and am returning this product."
1,Dead within 24 hours,"My story goes as follows: I purchased the Rio 800 128MB despite the poor reviews (big mistake), I charged overnight as per instructions. Next morning it lasted about an hour and died. Then I recharged it and used it again for about 2 hours, paused it, then it died again. Tried another recharge and it was totally dead this time - wouldn't even turn on. The software also froze on me three times trying to get MP3's copied onto the unit (Windows ME). I rang Tech Support and was told that 'sometimes the customer can damage the unit charging it - it must be returned'. IMHO a piece of junk."
1,complete garbage,"This thing is complete garbage. I can't believe they made a product where the battery will die even when it's not in use. I completely charge it, and won't use it for a day. The next day, the battery is dead. I calibrated it properly, I've been using gadgets and gizmos forever. My nickname among friends is gadget boy. (...)"
1,Reaffirming Rio's Weak Reputation,"Guess I should have read these reviews before frustrating myself with this purchase. What a piece of junk. ($)and it never worked, never! Charged the battery over night and it died while installing the software the next day. Then, it wouldn't recharge at all while it made a buzzing sound with the power cord plugged in. It's on its way back to the store..."
1,it finally broke!,"I brought my rio 800 128mb back in July and was wondering what the fuss was about with everyone else. At first it was a great player, was able to sqeeze about 40 songs on...went to the gym with it, nyc subway..it had some faults that I could live without such as remote and raio...but then the battery drained really fast, had to charge it every night, and at most I used it an hour a day...then finally after recharging and downloading music at the same time whcich I used to do all the time and there is no instruction that you can't do both! I got this error, checked my unit and it wouldn't turn on.But get this...I checked their website, and they know they have problems...check out their site... /but it's too little too late...stay away from RIO products"
1,"Battery problems, Bad support",The quality problems are described in other reviews. I got this as a gift in Dec 2001 and have had nothing but problems since. The support is attrocious and it is hassle trying to return it.I would look at other players. They should be ashamed for releasing it.
1,JUNK!!!,"Exactly what other reviews have said. I got this for Christmas and was so excited. It worked for 1 hour then lost all power. I could not get it restored and tried EVERYTHING. I returned it to BestBuy and exchanged for the same model. The EXACT same thing happened....What a waste of time, money, and 3 ounces. Terrible product and even when it did work briefly, the sound quality of the WMA files was horrible.I will now have to waste even more time returing this one for a REAL player."
1,...,"... I have just wasted ~$... on this piece of junk. The battery won't hold a charge, I can't hook it up to my typewriter to ""download"" songs...."
1,poor quality electronics and customer service,Like many of the other purchasers of the Rio 800 I have encountered battery problems that in my case began a few weeks after use. Even after correct calibration in the beginning I'm lucky if the battery lasts 2 hours now.Just now after 6 weeks the headphones only give sound on one side.If you try calling Rio for customer service by phone remember to have a meal available while you wait for an answer.In the distant past I remember being quite pleased with the player originally but if it doesn't work who cares about its features and sound quality.
1,"Battery problems, poor interface","The Rio has very serious battery problems. The first unit I got couldn't hold a charge, so I returned it and received another one which couldn't hold a charge. This even after I had received a new adapter of the type recommended by Sonic Blue.Besides the battery performance, the interface was difficult to use and non-intuitive. It was never really clear to me that the center button functioned as an ""OK"" or ""select"" button - maybe it should have been labelled.I would also stay from this product for other reasons. The first one I got didn't play sound to the right earphone, even when I changed headphones.Overall, a very disappointing experience. I would never buy a SonicBlue product again."
1,Battery issue not fixed,"Still have issues with battery. After following directions, battery is good for less than 1 hour. The battery timer is completely inaccurate. Customer support leaves a lot to be desired. Either no response or the run around. This is definitely not a top of the line model. Save your money."
1,A well designed piece of junk!!,"On the outside this is one of the best mp3 players. However, it has so many problems I don't even want to list because I am so disgusted with the horrible quality of this product. Don't buy this piece of junk!!"
1,Horrible,"They may have fixed all of the problems they were having with the player but I doubt they fixed their horrible tech support. Even if rio did finally fix the problems I would never buy anyhting from a company that realeases something so dysfunctional. I had all the same problems everyone else had. The player would only work for about 3 minutes at a time and in the end it stopped turning on all together. I sent it back once and they sent me one with the exact same problems. I told them the new one didn't work, wrote them two emails, and they never responded. It was a complete waste of money not to mention all the time I spent recallibrating that stupid battery. I just got the intel pocket concert and I love it. It works great, I would spend the extra [money] for a product that is really going to work."
3,Nah,I would recommend the Rio 900 player instead. It can hold 192 MB of music and is not that more expensive. I have also found that the 900's battery does not have a problem like the 800 initially does
1,One of the worst pieces of electronics I've ever bought,"This is absolutely one of the worst pieces of electronics I've ever bought. First, the software that comes with it is absolutely terrible, and the company that makes the software has gone out of business. Second, the player typically breaks within 2-3 days. I've read a number of other reviews, and based on my own experience with the product, you get about two decent days out of it. When you have to return it (when, not if) there is no customer service number to call, and the emails that you send typically don't get answered for 2-3 weeks. My first Rio 800 broke back in Nov-01, and it took unitl Apr-02 for them to finally ship me a new one. This new one broke within a week, and I have now started the ...process of replacing it. ... Based on the level of customer service and product quality I've seen in the Rio 800, I would also be wary of buying other SonicBlue products."
2,Defective Battery!,"My wife ordered this MP3 player for my birthday. I was very excited with the look and sound. Functionally, I found it very easy to use. The 128mb memory is adequate for me. I calibrated and charged the batter IAW the instructions. Immediately after unplugging the charger, the battery meter droped to 12%. It then seemd to play for about 2-3 hours (in high contrast with the advertised 11 hours). I re-calibrated it and the problem re-ocurred.... If they were unable to design/obtain a reliable rechargable battery system, they should have just built it for disposable ones. It really is a shame because this is the only problem I had with my RIO 800...."
2,Where is the...Quality Control????,"So, you think that MAYBE you might get lucky and get something from RIO that acutally has been through a QA process. Wrong!!Just got a 128 Rio800 w/ the new battery pack. Did the charge as directed (unit topped off w/150 min left) - did the firmware upgrade to vs156 - installed software, did download of audio and MP3....now the fun starts.Play the audio - it sounds like grinding glass w/staticPlay the MP3 - unit locks up and you have to take off the battery pack to get it to turn off.Bottom line - it doesn't play.Now we will see how long Customer Support takes to give some support......."
1,Not dependable,"I bought this in August, it is now January and I have gotten less than 20 hours of use out of it. The battery never kept charge and it kept turning off. Now all it plays is static. The 1 year warranty is okay - but after spending $299 dollars, I now have to pay $30 to have a replacement sent. Then it took almost 6 weeks to get a response from the time I first emailed them with the problem - I eventually ended up calling tech support on my money. Now it should be sent 'when it is in stock.'"
1,...DO NOT BUY!!!,"Hmmm...lets see where to start. This...thing [is bad]! I just got it a couple weeks ago and it is totally bugging out on me. Its turning on/off whenver it feels like it, sound only comes out from one side of headphones(both sides if plugged in halfway >:[ ), tells me I got full 10hrs left after charging then goes down to 2hrs 10min later, and in the end makes me want to toss the...thing on the ground and step on it!This freakin Enron-type company knows it too! They make these horrible gadgets that don't work...Then I find out on the website not to use the adapter it came w/ because it ruins the player and instead they'll send me a newer one...People..don't buy [this]..."
1,do not--i repeat DO NOT--buy this product,"god would this thing be great if it worked. but my $300 (at the time) mp3 player isn't worth a penny. i am now on my third one and sonic blue keeps convincing me to try ""just one more fix."" not only will it not hold a charge on its rechargeable battery (keeping it charging every minute that it's not in use, i get TEN MINUTES of play time before it dies), but the normal alkaline battery pack that sonic blue was kind enough to send me to fix all my problems won't work either. i get 3-4 hours instead of the 12 they promise and it dies whenever the battery gets to ""7 hours remaining"". they have had me exchange two units, calibrate, calibrate twice, calibrate twice and then recharge, calibrate twice-press select-unplug for a minute-and then recharge, use an alkaline battery, and download new firmware. bottom line, this product simply doesn't work. and speaking from someone who doesn't have $300 to just throw away...i couldn't be more angry and frustrated!"
1,Only worked once,"I used my Rio 800 one time and it quit working.The song would play, but the audio quit working. I purchased the Rio over a month ago, and I still have not been able to use it. When I called for support, they had no idea what was wrong. For the price, I would suggest another manufacture. I had to send it in to Rio for a new one, and I am still waiting for it."
2,Just returned mine,"I could not get this thing to run for more than 20 minutes. I calibrated the batteries 3 times but it would run out waaaay before the ""10 hours"" claimed by the manufacturer. After the 3rd calibration, it played for a few minutes before the sound completely cut out. I tried the headphones on another unit and they worked just fine, which leads me to believe the problem is with the Rio. Maybe I just got a dud."
1,write-off,"I have owned many personal players. This product is by far the worst I have ever used. • It continually freezes (i.e. crashes) so that I have to slide off the battery pack and then restart. This is not convenient in the middle of a workout. • The RIO 800 tells me that I am 100% charged, and that I have 11 hours of use ahead. It then runs out of power after 90 minutes. • After 2 uses, the microphone jack seems to have broken, and my RIO 800 now plays music through one ear only. I have tried it with several different headsets and get the same result."
2,RIO 800 is Poor At least,"I have had the product for less than 6 months and after the product was charged originally, it never held a charge for more than an hour afterwards. Product drivers seem to be plentiful, but generally don't work. I have used RealOne software (which is shipped with the product)and upgrades. I have used MusicMatch Jukebox (which I think is a great product) and I have used Windows Media Player 7.1 All products hang when transferring music to the machine. I am using up to date operating software (Windows 2000 SP3). There is literaly no support I can find. RIO Support when you mail them, do not answer. I wish I could truly find an MP3 player out there that actually does what it is suppose to do ....."
1,Rio 800 128mb-don't buy it!,"Whatever you do-don't buy this!Pro-the actual player is cool, and the headphones are titeCon-the software doesn't work-three different computers wouldn't recognize the player-two with windows xp, and one with '98se. then, i saw in the instructions that i should download some software from the web site, so i tried to, but it wasn't at the site.-so, if u want a cool player that can't be recognized, get it. otherwise, steer clear."
2,Why did it die?,"I loved it until one day (about 3-4 months after I got it), it died for no apparent reason -- I hadn't even dropped it or anything; I've taken very good care of it. It is an expensive little machine to only be usuable for less than a year!"
1,Total waste of money,This thing just died on me and I can't get it work again. I've tried just about everything. I hate it.
2,Another Defective Unit,"Unit worked fine for 20 minutes, after which the the power went off and would not come back on. Works fine with battery charger plugged in so I tend to think it looks like it is a problem with the rechargable battery or its system of communicating with the processor. If the unit worked the way it did for the first 20 minutes, I would give it close to a 5 star rating. However, based on my experience and the other user reviews I have seen, I can not recommend anyone buy this unit until the manufacturer does something about what appears to be an abnormally high defect rate."
2,Poor Customer Service,"I have 2 RIO MP3 Players. Both of them were purchased in June 2002. The buttons on one of them have stopped working and I have been trying to return it under warranty for 2 weeks. I have been e-mailing and calling there support center everyday. They request that you fax proof of purchase, which normally would not be a problem, except there fax machine is a voice/fax and if you do not hit the send button at exactly the right second it doesn't go through. After spending 20 minutes on the phone I now have an address to return it to. However, I have little hope of getting it fixed and returned. I would look for a more reliable product next time."
2,"Nice Features, Bad Quality","This is the 4th Rio product in my household. I bought a Rio500, my wife has a Rio500 and now I have the Rio800. We also very briefly had a RioVolt 90 CD player. The quality on all 4 products has been abysmal. The Rio800 has rechargable batteries which they claim have 11 hours of use between charges. 5 hours is more like it for the first 6 months, now it's about 4 hours (a little over a year old). There is no option for replacing the battery. I've also noticed after a year of use (now out of warranty), I get these bizzare screeching or warbling noises in the middle of playing music or audio books. Now the thing stopped working all together. The features of this product were right on target, but Rio really has a lot to learn about quality."
2,the rio 800 is great if they send you one that works!!,"this would be a great mp3 player if only it could work propely, ive had 3 of these players & have had to send each of them back within a day after recieving them for various reasons.doesnt this company check there products before they ship them out?i think that they should.for the few minutes that it was working though it sounded great."
2,OVERRATED,"This product, and all products from Rio or Sonicblue, is overrated. For the money spent the product is less than satisfactory. The unit itself is made from thin ... plastic that can easily break, it is notorious for having power problems with its backpacks,you get ... unreliable headphones, the hardware and software do not always recognize each other when installing on the PC harddrive, incredibly poor customer service. Oh yeah, you have to buy memory expansion backpacks from them as opposed to the smart media cards that most mp3 players and portable electronics use now. The only thing good about this Rio 800 is its attractive design and backlit LCD display. Buy an mp3 player from a more reliable company; like the Techno Yepp or Pendant Yepp from Samsung which are comparably priced. Or, splurge and get the Sony mp3 Network Walkman. Don't let the ""professional"" magazine reviews fool you."
3,Strange software support.,"The player doesn't die. They fixed the problem.I love the machine but the software. I first installed the Real JukeBox. and found it too slow- compare to Windows Media Player. give it up. Then I tried Windows Media Player. It works fine there, except for it doesn't display the artist on the screen of the rio800(if you transfer files from Real Juke Box, it does display artist and albumn).My mp3 files are not named by the number of the track(without the title of the song). The player only display the filename of the mp3 file. Thus, if you want to have the song's name showed on the scree, my gotta name the mp3 file as the title of the song. For example, A_New_Day_Has_Come.mp3The mp3 player package doesn't include a remote control. The headphone is weird. I never use it.I guess, take into account of the price for a 128MB player, Rio800 is a good one."
2,"Really, really, slow customer service on defective units","I got my Rio 800, installed the software, put the songs on, and listened to music for about 30 minutes. Then all the sudden my player goes into this sleep mode,right in the middle of a song, but I just got done charging it. So, then I put the thing you charge it with in and it woke the player out of sleep mode, and it said that I still had 11 hours of play time! ..."
1,"Lousy product, lousy support...","So, I got one of these for my birthday. It seemed like a good choice, but the product was defective out of the package. It kept simply shutting down when I used it. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another. This one took a month to break - the on/off switch just moves freely and does not turn the product on or off anymore. I first contacted Rio (SonicBlue) nearly two months ago via e-mail. They took over two weeks to reply, stating that the product appeared to be defective (duh) and to get back to them with the same info I had already supplied (don't you love automation?). It has been now nearly a month since that last e-mail (which stressed NOT to send the product back without an RMA). So, I call them (toll call) and they first disconnected me since all lines were busy, then when I called back - they told me there was a 20 minute wait (on my dime). Now I am on hold while waiting to talk to them.I would highy recommend staying away from RIO altogether."
2,It's like a Cadillac with a extremely small gas tank.,"This product looks good, sounds good and is easy to configure. However, Like all the other reviews here.. The ""10 hour"" battery life is more like 1 hour. If you're lucky..I calibrated battery correctly, even tried it twice. I had the most recent revised battery adapter connector that the company 'says' is the correct connector as per their docs.But yet, this product has turned into nothing more than a BUZZKILL to the person whom I bought this for, for Christmas.Yes, and ""Customer Support"" is the usual bad joke.Obviously will have to just return the product to the store and try another product with the same features and specs.Seems like the Rio 800 series will do nothing more than increase returns for SonicBlue and sales for the Intel Concert.Highly disappointing product, don't waste your time.WCH"
4,Bargain Player...better than you think,"The Rio 800 has had some poor press, but the problem is not the player but the documentation accompanying it. The battery seems to be a major problem until you figure out that it must be calibrated several times until the screen says, ""the battery is calibrated"" and not that there are 0 minutes left to charge. By the third time, I finally got 10hrs. playing time. The sounds tends to be a little ""tinny"" but that is a headphone problem and the sound can be adjusted on the device. I'm not a ""tech"" type, but you just need to play with this for a while to learn what it will do. Then, you'll be more than happy for the price."
1,Only lasted for half a hour.,I guess I was too opportunistic because I still went ahead and bought it after seeing all the bad reviews. My unit arrived yesterday. I carefully followed the instructions to get it charged and still the unit just went dead after I connected to the charger for 30 minutes. The charging light and the LCD just went off and that was the end of it. Can't turn the unit back on with or without the charger connected. Continued to have it charged overnight and the same thing this morning. I cannot believe SonicBlue still continue to ship it with the defective rate this high.Reconsider if you want to buy it.
2,Beware the battery,"I am generally skeptical of rechargable batteries in consumer electronics. My worries were upheld with the Rio 800. Properly calibrating the battery nonetheless led to erroneous power readings and low..low..low battery life (~2 hours, 10 advertised).The screen seems positioned a bit offcenter, making certain menu items frustrating to read. In addition there were dust particles on the inside of the case, impossible to remove.On the plus side, the sound quality is very good and the earphones better than expected. The unit seems sturdy, but in my mind not worth such hassles at such a price."
2,Not up to par.,"A little too pop oriented for me.Not the progressive rock I like in their earlier stuff.Photo's of Ghost,The World became the World,Chocolate Kings far surpass this CD."
3,not their best,"I had been used to hearing early PFM, the progressive stuff. I had heard that these later recordings were getting very hard to find so i picked it up in a Virginia Beach music store...a rare find. When i popped it into my car CD player i recoiled from the sounds, thinking ""this really sucks!"" But after a few listenings i now find the first track irresistible. It is great. This album has a kind of Latin dance music sound, due to the horn section. It has a few tracks i still don't like at all, but most of it is ok. The title track is particularly bad. If you are expecting something progressive in the vein of early PFM you will be dissapointed. Still I find myself playing it, especially that first song."
4,For all of us two generations removed from the farm!,My father and grandparents would tell me stories about growing up on the farm in Iowa. Farm Memories filled in the details for me and made me appreciate the good and the bad of rural life. I highly recommend it!
2,a bit watered-down,"I am a huge fan of Edelman, but I regretted having bought this book; I would say this is a kind of half-successful attempt at vulgarizing what he explained so well elsewhere: there is nothing to be found here that wasn`t already explained in more detail in ""Neural Darwinism"" and ""The Remembered Present"". So stay away from this one if you read the others. If you never read anything by him, go for his ""Neural Darwinism"". Reading his books was definitely a great intellectual experience of my life. Go for it!PS: Da man is a genius."
2,Flowers shipped via UPS arrived wilted,I had heard good things about Pro FlowersThose sent to my recovering family member arrived wilted and dyingGranted the weather was in the 100sThey just didnt stay cool enough to survive the boxNo more summer flower orders from our family
5,How to leave a lasting legacy to your grandchildren,"Buy and read a copy to you grandchildren; They will remember the experience forever. I actually reference back to this book when I do studies on philosophy and religion. There is much more here than meets the eye, and the stories have survived for millenia."
4,"Good intro to Norse ""myths"" for young people!","Simplified watered down versions of stories from the Eddas. This book seems to be aimed at a late elementary or jr. high school age reader. For that target audience this is a great introduction and would probably be the best thing you could buy if you were trying to picque a young persons interest in the Norse ""Myths"". If your an adult there are several other books on this subject that I would recomend over this one though."
3,children of odin,the book is centered on the mythology of Odin. It has many short stories and covers most of the initial/basic information I was looking for about the Norse myths and bedtime stories. Most stories are suitable for children and all have moral relief for children from very young thru teenage years. It would be an excellent book for 7 to 10 yr olds! boys and girls alike. I especially liked the way LOki is portrayed as mischiveous and sneaky vs. evil.
3,disapointment,it was very dissapointing to recieve this book and find out that there were no illustrations in it. this was not clear to me at all when i purchased the book.
5,ok,"This item is what it was represented to be, and I am most appreciative of the fact that I received what I paid for."
3,"Cd de grabaciones ""antiguas"" de esta gran cantante.","La peruana Tania libertad es una de mis cantantes favoritas. Sin embargo, este cd contiene grabaciones en donde su voz estaba en vias de convertirse en lo que hoy constituye una de las mas privilegiadas de America Latina. Por ello le doy solo 3 estrellas."
2,A great classic of Ameican naturalism...terrible digital edition,"Anyone reading a review of Sister Carrie probably knows the story and the literary significance of the novel as a seminal work in the Naturalist school, so i'll skip that. Most important note is on this Kindle edition. It is riddled with typos and errors. It is very difficult to follow. I would recommend you hunt around for another edition or check another platform for your free download of this American classic of the turn of the century."
2,"Good story, bad writing!","I have just finished reading Sister Carrie, and until the very last pages I was constantly trying to wipe the sleep out of my eyes! If there has ever been an overrated writer Dreiser is him! Constantly trying to add more details than are needed for a complete understanding of the characters' lives, Dreiser attempts to trap us in their minds--and that is not a place you will want to be. Instead of making us enjoy the characters and feel sorry for them, he makes us wish them to die suddenly on the next page! What an upset!"
4,Excellent character piece,"The story of characters deeply entwined and studied in depth. It studies wealth, fame, charity, marriage and more and how they contribute, or don't, to happiness. Very well written and enjoyable"
4,Sister Carrie,"I enjoyed this novel. She certainly was ahead of her time as far as relationships go. She was not the victim of this book but I did not perceive her as the heroine, either. She certainly knew how to use men."
4,The Inevitability of Dreiser,"As in An American Tragedy, in Sister Carrie Dreiser sets the reader up for a long, excruciating slide downhill for the lovely, unsuspecting female victim of his story. Late 19th-century Chicago blusters and glimmers, and we know that it was a very different time than the one we live in. Roles and types abound in Dreiser's world; a nice place to visit, no doubt, but who would want to live in it?"
2,Maybe one of the worst readings of an audio book I have ever heard.,"The narrator who reads this book uses very little inflection and has an irritating voice to boot. Being an auditory learner, I prefer to listen to books over reading the words; this reader makes it almost painful. Since the material itself is far from scintillating, the reader could make up the difference with a good reading with lots of inflection and characterization, but she doesn't. Blah!"
5,Just Lovely,"A quick paced story of a young woman's insight of being dumped in a big city, left to search for a life on her own. Sister Carrie has to be one of the greatest literature pieces ever created in that one decade. My personal favorite tragic pessimitic fictional classic. Just lovely."
4,"A Classic Yes, but not the Greatest One","Sister Carrie is a serious, thoughtful look at the role of money in the lives of men and women at the turn of the century. It delves into a number of serious themes: poverty, loss of wealth, role of women in society, urban culture. The characters, particularly Carrie herself, are well drawn and memorable.However, the book is not the easiest read nor is the language the most elegant. An important, if not imperative, read-"
3,Only 1/2 Way done....,"When reading booklists (one of my fav. hobbies) I came across this title and the review was somthing like a lover's life rises as her partner (Drouet) declines. I am only about 220/473 pgs. I was quite dissapointed at first but now there is immense action that is quite enthralling. I can't wait to finish, partly so I can read another novel."
3,Should have been shorter,"This is an interesting book with great character developments.The second half of the book dragged on with much repetition and I got bored, skipped a lot and read the ending."
3,A relatively good read,"I liked the literature aspect of this book and the picutre it presented from that period of time in US. On negative note, I found the story long and kind of boring. Furthermore, although I am a big fan of stories that reflect realistic life situations and characters, I felt that this story was sad and disturbing beyond what you may expect from similar situations. From the Amazon point of view, I found the kindle version flawless and easy to read."
2,A dated classic,"Perhaps it is because this book is rather dated, but I only found this book to be ok. I found it very old-fashioned and prudish at times - though I am sure it was quite the scandal in its day! It was a day's worth of light reading, something to pass the time. But I would not label it as a favorite of mine.I couldn't help but feel sorry for the men in the story, rather than for Carrie. Carrie is spoiled, manipulative and destructive in her pursuit of the ""finer things in life"". The men she uses to get there suffer the most for it!If you like this book, the $2.95 price tag for this edition is worth it! I first downloaded the freebie, but the formatting was so off, I went ahead and downloaded this one. I just wish I had enjoyed the story better..."
1,Yuck!,"This is one of, if not the most, displeasing thing I've ever read. It's depressing, not cathartic. So it's depressing for no reason. They should attach a packet of Prozac to the last page. The characters are hopeless. You actually wind up rooting for Carrie, just because there is no one else to root for. The book is SO pompous and chauvenist, I could barely stand it. Every female in the story is either cold and materialistic, or young, materialistic and stupid. I haven't encountered such blatant sexism in a ""classic"" since Howell's ""Editha."" I will say, though, that Dreiser's actual writing talent is incredible, he has a mystical and dark way with words; too bad he had to waste it on this. My life actually would have been better without reading this."
1,BORRRRRRRING!,THIS IS POSITIVELY ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ - AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE READ IT IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT. NOW THAT PROJECT WAS OVER 20 YEARS AGO BUT THE BITTER MEMORY OF THIS INSANELY MONOTONOUS BOOK STILL HAUNTS ME. SISTER CARRIE IS SO BOGGED DOWN WITH SYMBOLISM IT IS REPETITIVE AND THE STORY LINE MISSES ITS MARK COMPLETELY. TAKE MY ADVICE - IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS BOOK DO SO!
1,I hated this book,"I was taking a class in HS that was called Chicago Lit/Contempory Novels, and for the Chicago Lit part of it, this is one of the books we read. I found this book to be extremely dull, and could not force myself to finish it. This was the feeling that the entire class had, and so after reading about half of it, the teacher gave up, and we switched to another book."
5,I enjoyed reading and analyzing this novel and recomend it.,"I found this novel very intriguing and moving. The symbols and representations are very analytical. ""Sister Carrie"" causes one to think twice about oneself, and to reconsider one's own definition of true happiness and success. It shows one how society can influence one to think in the manner in which one does. The characters face good times and bad times and experience true tests of strength and survival. The results are both well developed and interesting to discover. It is difficult to put the book down. When reading this novel one must understand the sybolism and look deep into the context to acquire the meanings of it. Another interesting fact about this novel is that Theodore Dreiser actually wrote the novel in the year 1900. I am a junior in high school and I strongly recomend the reading of this novel to anyone."
1,Sometimes Free is Too Expensive,"Sometimes free is too expensive. A brief sample:""It was all wonderful, all mast, all far removed, and she sank in spirit inwardly and fluttered feebly as of the heart as she though of enter any one of these mighty concerns and asking for something to do something that she could do anything.""This is apparently an American book translated into Chinese, and then re-translated back into English. Or something of which I can maybe not be understanding to do with anything."
2,A disappointment,"I was so excited to be able to download this work by Theodore Dreiser, from Amazon. However, when I started to read the story, I found that the formatting of this Kindle edition book was terrible. Words were spelled incorrectly and even grammar was incorrect. I have no idea why since I am sure the written version of Sister Carried is perfect. Big disappointment."
1,Corrupted,"The Kindle version is full of incorrect words, transposed words, mispellings. It's poorly formatted. During much of the reading I found myself having to guess which word was intended. Get the Random House digital version for $1.99 instead."
2,annoying editing,"I must admit I've never read Sister Carrie, but it is a free Kindle book and I thought I had nothing to lose. I must say the editing done on this book is terrible. Words are missing or the wrong word appears in a sentence. It makes it difficult to understand the whole sentence. I've even seen the same sentence repeated on the same page. I really would enjoy this e-book much, much more, if it didn't appear to have been hastily thrown together. I've not have this problem with Kindle books I have purchased."
3,Fluidity of life in a budding capitalistic society,"I think that the subject matters of this book definitely have a special place in the American literature. The attractions and risks of the vibrant, everchanging society and confusions over the shifting values and the desire to maintain the appearance of the old morals, and one's life can change any minute by luck, misfortune, or choices resulted from impulsivity or lazy complacency etc. I gave only 3 stars because of the lack of personalities in main characters, they seem rather flat to me, not generating much emotions, neither compassion, or disgust. However, perhaps this also may be was the author's intention to depict how ind's volitions and personalities are inconsequential to the more powerful forces of the circumstances of that time."
2,I don't know why this is a classic,This book is boring and dull. I had to read it for a class and I don't see what all the fuss is about. The main character is dull and has no values or morals. She is not what I would call a heroine.
3,"Three stars for size of book, not quality of content","I ordered the paperback version thinking that it would be a normal paperback size book. When it arrived, it turned out to be almost twice as wide as a normal paperback book. The downside is that it is not very portable. I like to read while on a bus or train. Having this book open is like reading a textbook, not very practical in many situations in which I like to read.So, before you buy, be sure you know the dimensions of the book. The one I received is about 8 inches wide, 10 inches high and about .7 inches thick."
5,Great book even with a few typos,"Maybe I'm just not as unforgiving as the other reviewers, but I found this edition to read just fine. Yes, there were a few errors, but not nearly as many as the other reviewers claimed. Aside from that, it's a great piece of literature from that era. It is a story of life in the factories of late 19th century Chicago, a story of an ""immoral"" girl being taken care of by men to escape the factory life, and the misery she caused them. Evidently, this book was considered scandalous in its day, as Carrie never suffers any consequences for her immorality. A good read."
1,Terrible Copyediting!!!,"hello all, my review for this book is based entirely on the quality of this text, not on the novel/story. Sister Carrie is a masterpiece and should be read by all, but this particular text is horrendous. The words ""though"" and ""thoughT"" are used interchangeably, words are left out of sentences, periods are placed randomly in the middle of sentences, and there are even instances where sections are repeated (i.e. six lines are followed by the exact six lines).If you want to enjoy the Sister Carrie that Dresier wrote, do not buy this edition! You will be disappointed. Please order a text from a different publisher."
4,I honestly cannot believe anyone doesn't love this book....,"Okay granted I had to read it for a paper, I still loved this book. I started to read merely the first chapter and I found I could not put it down. Dreiser is incredibly unestimated and not given his due credit. Those who don't even like this book are probably just bitter that they had to read anything at all because it was for school. It probably wouldn't matter what book they had to read they would hate everything. Sister Carrie is anything but boring and everything including amazing..."
1,Free is too expensive for this poorly produced book,"As many other people have said, this edition is riddled with typos. Words are also omitted. It's just a mess, and I quit in disgust after two or three pages--tiny pages on an iPod Touch! Don't bother."
4,Alluring Read,"This book was a lesson in the journey from poor to rich and how even though moving up the ladder of success, Sister Carrie never achieved the peace and happiness she thought success and money would bring. It goes back to the old cliche that money doesn't guarantee happiness. I found it a very interesting read. It more or less teaches a very important life lesson."
1,Don't bother with this free version...,"Don't bother ordering this version...within a few paragraphs, one can tell that the book was transcribed very poorly, possibly by someone for whom English is not their first language."
1,"Great novel, horrible edition.","It's a shame such a great novel has been digitized so poorly. I didn't realize the extent of its corruption until I compared it to a proper version, and was shocked. I'm not exaggerating to say that nearly every page has missing or incorrect words, typos, and the formatting is overall very poor. Everything down to the very first paragraph is riddled with errors. Please do yourself a favor and read any edition but this one. I'm amazed Amazon doesn't remove this for it's absysmal quality."
3,"Amazon has a newer, corrected free version","While this edition is awful, Amazon has a new edition that's corrected, published in 2011.Sister Carrie: a NovelLink above will take you right there, but it's ASIN B004UJJ8XC if you have trouble. Found it while updating my free kindle classics list today and read the first few chapters - error free.Morris"
4,money changes everything,"'Sister Carrie' is about a naive girl from the boonies, circa 1890, who travels to Chicago to find more out of life. She runs into men, gets swept into going to New York where her life goes through great changes when the man she is with, who happens to be her sole provider, completely unravels emotionally, spiritually and financially. Carrie's life proceeds in a manner very atypical of heroines of that era. The story builds to a very fine conclusion.My only complaint with 'Sister Carrie' is that it does take some time to ""warm up"", and the author's writing style not especially fluid. I also felt after reading the book I never completely understood Carrie or the men in her life, ... but maybe the author left it to the reader ponder over afterwards??Bottom line: certainly a remarkable piece of literature in its day, and thankfully the material hasn't aged a bit. Recommended."
5,great read,This was one of the most absorbing classic works I've read in a long time. Dreiser artfully tells of the rise and fall of two of the novels central characters The contrast of each characters very different beginnings and subsequent rise and demise of each is quite fascinating. The novel is written in very simple and straightforward language which is a departure from the more wordy and heady classics that I've begun to tackle. A real gem of a novel. Read it.
4,Good book overall,"I really enjoyed the first 495 pages of the book, with Dreiser's excellent descriptions, analyses, and an excellent plot. I'm very disappointed with the ending of the book, however, and I feel a little empty upon finishing it. If Dreiser had spent just a few more paragraphs, it would have made for a much better ending, but still, a fine first book from Dreiser."
4,Sister Carrie,Great local color regarding Chicago at the turn of the century (1890). Very descriptive. Modern in that the woman doesn't get punished for being superficial and materialistic.
1,Bad Edition,I was so disappointed in this ebook. I could hardly wait to sit down and begin reading and then discovered it was filled with errors. I found it unreadable.
1,Kindle version is corrupt,"This Kindle edition is missing words and has words wrong in the first paragraph! However, there is another free version with a melon colored cover that is OK."
5,Police Puppet Gift,I saw this puppet at my library and decided to purchase it for a gift. The detail on the uniform especially on the hat and shirt was very clever and made this toy more real.
5,Niece loved this webkin,"She loved the little frog""hopper"" and the computer interaction. Great price.Perfect for an add on.Ganz quality for stuffed pets is always good."
4,I like my Bullfrog,My Bullfrog is quit large and very colorful. I named him Hoppy and he lives with all my Webkinz animals in a very large house in Webkinz World.
4,Webkinz Bullfrog,"I purchased this toy for my 7 year old daughter who loves to play on-line with her webkinz. I try to get her the Pet of The Month so that she can take advantage of the special prizes they offer. Once we get the pets, she adopts them on-line and then the physical toy joins countless others in her closet, on her bed, in her toy bins. All-in-all, a quality product that offers lots of fun for pre-teens. I even get on the website and play some of the games :)"
2,Too Dark,"I love ambient, and even darker ambient as in some of Laswell and Buckethead's projects, but this album went off the deep end into menace and depressing gloom. One exceptional track - Maps of Impossible Worlds - and the rest feels like noodling on a very bad trip. If you find yourself too happy or positive in life, then play this to bring yourself down and give yourself nightmares. Otherwise, stay away. You've been warned."
1,Just get the book.,"Read the description carefully, it says, diagrams, charts, and illustractions (but NO pictures). It has 2 CDs that's pretty deceptive since there appears to be less than 20MB worth of data combined. I guess the quiz bank would be useful. Otherwise, I would just get the book or get this used."
1,"Lousy, a lot of promise, did not develop theme","Lousy, really dissappointing. There is lot of promise in a story which pits man against all-conquering machines, but this team did not develop the potentialities in such a theme. Very bad science, very inadequate imagination of the full developmental potential of a machine-based culture and its powers/potentials. Reads like a word-processor wrote this novel. A machine could do better. Clearly a franchise product, a cookie-cutter product mass-manufactured for an established market (i.e. anything with the trademark DUNE in its title)."
2,Glaring flaw,"I just had to put the book down. In this book, supposedly we see the theoretical work leading to ""folding space"" take its first steps toward practical application. Yet in this pre-hyperspace setting, everyone seems to be able to zip around the galaxy at will, travelling effortlessly between planents and star systems apparently instantaneously. No explanation for this is ever given, which is the type of glaring plot hole that Frank Herbert would never have allowed. Isn't this supposed to be SCIENCE fiction?Pages and page are devoted to meaningless descriptions of trivial details (such as parties), there is no dialogue to speak of, and the character relationships are murky and hard to follow.The DUNE series was much better when it was simply the 6 original books by Frank Herbert, with the tantalizing and never to be fulfilled hints at the final, seventh novel.Each new addition weakens the original Dune achievement."
2,Was this a first draft?,"I'm a big fan of Dune and the other Dune Prequels. IMO this is the worst of them (I haven't read the Battle of Corrin yet). I only recommend this book to die hard Dune fans who won't be able to sleep at night knowing they've missed part of the ancient timeline. Even in that case, you could just, read the timeline in the appendix. This book repeats obvious information, over and over again. It spends WAY too much time re-hashing what the readers already know."
2,Did they do any research at all????,"I've read Frank Herbert's complete Dune Series and I have read all of the Brian Herbert, & Kevin J. Anderson prequels that have recently been published. This is the most disappointing book in the entire series to date! My husband and I both found the storyline lacking and the continuity of this book with the rest of the series is terrible. They put a story together that goes against much of the later series. What were you guys thinking? I won't give away too much of the story but they are terribly lacking and off base in the Norma Cenva story which was originally begun in the God Emperor of Dune book and Harkonnen's story also deviates from the original plot. My husband and I are so terribly disappointed in this book. There are lags in the plot and it's slow reading."
3,Okay... now THAT'S better!!!,"Okay, I admit... Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are getting better.After the horror that was ""Dune: The Butlerian Jihad"" I thought all hope had been lost. Appearantly some people CAN learn new tricks... including how to write. I am happy to see that there is actually a solid plot in this one.And speaking of plots- I actually got an EMOTIONAL response during this book; whereas the only true emotion I felt during ""The Butlerian Jihad"" was that of suicidal tendencies. They should have had a coupon with that one for a mail-in t-shirt that rewarded the reader for surviving that ordeal.That said, however, you'll never understand THIS book w/out the other. Consider it a trial by fire. ""That which does not kill you only makes you better"", and so on. However, after enduring that literary ""gom jabar"" we are actually rewarded with ""Dune: The Machine Crusade""."
4,Entertaining,I ejoyed the book and am anxious for the final book. I would give the book 5 stars if the authors didn't repeat information regarding characters over and over and over. (My one gripe of the book)Some of the characters are built up and their history is a fantastic read and others are built up and snuffed out and I wonder why they were bought into the writing at all. However that being said. I found the book entertaining. Hoping the next is due soon with less repetition and it is sure to be a 5!
1,interesting but dissapointing,"Frank was a genius. He made me understand the Bene Gesserett by how characters reacted and behaved, without saying stupid things like ""I'm the greatest sorceress in the universe..."" I want to laugh at the lack of philosophical introspection, character development, and depth these two authors display compared to Frank. Its a long, labororious read, and its only redeeming feature is that its made from Frank's notes, there-fore its interesting. How these two authors fill in the blanks is so utterly dissapointing. Fortunately the 5% of Frank's genius out of the 95% of the murkyness makes it worth a read. I'll buy the next one too. Re-read your father's book, Brian. Watch how he makes you feel something about Jessica without almost literally saying--as you do-- ""Feel something about Jessica here."""
1,Boring and silly,"Easily the most boring of the non-Frank Herbert series. Very little character development. At times, the plotline is downright silly (Norma's transformation, Holtzman's end, everything about the Titan Hecate, the Cogiters' meddling). The way they explain the so-called Harkonnen treachery was ludicrous. I kept hoping they'd explain the source of the long standing Atreides-Harkonnen animosity, but was very disappointed. Maybe they'll do it on about page 600 of the next (and hopefully last!) book, but I'm not eager to find out anymore.It also seemed like they injected politics of the last couple years into the story. How lame. Hardly worthy of a saga developed over a dozen novels."
2,Better than the Butlerian Jihad but...,"I bought this book against my better judgement and because Borders had it 20% off. The first book, The Butlerian Jihad was horrible. This sequel is twice as good, but that's still not saying much. Have these guys even read the first Dune books? Save your money and go buy some of Brin's Uplift series books or even Hamilton's Neutronium Alchemist series.What a shame!"
2,Did not reach its potential,"This series has developed the history previous to Frank Herbert's Dune. I like what it attemps, but with this offering, the novel did not have a clear sense of direction. There were sub plots that could have been bettered developed & characters that were not well defined. I hope with the next installment more focus will be applied to a clear fast paced story line."
5,Love,I highly recommend the Dune Series for anyone to read. Still trying to get through the series myself but worth the time and effort
4,A good read for fans of Dune,"I really liked it, but at the same time the repetitive retelling of the previous book is really too much, if i'm reading the second book in the trilogy, i'm suppose to remember which character did what, no need to go over three paragraph to go over it again ...Otherwise, nice plot, and nice explanation of future events ..."
3,Thoughts on The Machine Crusade,"The Machine Crusade is a good read, but suffers from being the middle book of a trilogy. Worth the read though."
5,DUNE Machine Crusade,"I was missing this audio book from my collection. This CD set completes all my DUNE books on audio. Shipping was excellent. No problems. If you are a Duneite, like me, this 3 book Dune prequel answers questions and gives other background info on the Dune series. Dale Luna"
1,Machine Crusade - Awful!,"The writing is trite and certainly has none of the depth of the original Dune series. When you're fan, you can't help but want to read ""pre-quels,"" a ""history"" of the ""later-in-time"" books. Unfortunately, the series from Brian Herbert and Anderson just hasn't measured up to expectations. Can I say ""awful"" again? Best wait for the paperback and not waste your money."
3,dune machine crusade: what do you want?,"this book is very interesting for a filler it is like the second book in lord of the rings, it is a filler and is building up to the end. why would you yell at a book that wasn't supposed to be the best in the series."
1,"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","Boring!!! Normally I don't write reviews, but felt the need to on this one. First I'd like to state that I love the Dune series by Frank Herbert. In my opinion it's the best science fiction ever written. And so far I have enjoyed the prequels written by Brian Herbert. ""The Machine Crusade"" has been the exception. I am not even half way through and will have to make myself finish it. Too many story lines going at once and none is developed well. There's no depth to them. They're all flimsy. Like I said I'm not even half way through but I don't think that's enough time for this book to redeem itself."
2,Predictable and unimaginative,"While the book managed to keep my attention, it lacked the depth and complexity of the original. Characters are developed in detail then abruptly killed. It seemed as though the author could not figure out what to do with them. Wait for paperback."
3,At last we find out how to pronounce Fremen!,"This seems to be a bridge book, rather than the one we have all been waiting for. Lots of archetypes, good guys, bad guys, merciless machines, powerful women, early melange usage. Credulity must be extended more than usual: planet-wide secret projects staying secret, huge conspiracies involving thousands of low level people remaining undetected, lack of planetary defenses for ground assault (how naive can we be?), lots of things. But maybe that is what SF is all about.And in the last 4 words of the 692 page book, we learn how to pronounce Freman."
1,An OK book - but what a drag....,"A lot of other reviewers have made the same comment, but I had to throw my two cents in:I got the unabridged audio version of this book, and it is the first time ever that I have actually skipped an entire CD. I nearly threw the darn thing out the window! So much needless repetition, so many out-of-place and contradictory facts, and so many rehashed cliches and reworded profoundities that I, a few times, actually pulled hair out of my head in frustration!I honestly feel that these authors could do a lot better. There were seeds of a decent story here, but it never sprouted. I never felt pitty for Serena or any of the other overly melodramatic, underly written tragic characters. I cheered when the book was over - because it was over. I think the authors might have used an emotionless thinking machine programmed for endless rewording of the same plot line to complete this long and boring book."
1,Read something else if you're a male,"This book is boring, lacks action, and is essentially a modern novel pretending to be sci-fi with too much time spent on male-female relationships. The book is also PC. That isn't surprising when almost all the names are female on the publishing/editorial team that worked on this book. I put this book down after reading half of it.If you are a male then go read a real sci-fi book that isn't going to bore you with almost all the lead male characters all falling in love with boring, plain-looking, and deformed female characters. The one hot female character is described as shallow, cold, and anti-male.The lead female scientist/engineer is female and the lead male one is a bad opportunistic guy and second rate to her. The lead female head of the human Jihad is good and noble, and the lead male Jihad leader a bad guy political opportunist who has no concern for the lives of others."
5,A book does not get better than this.....,I am enamored of the writing style of the two authors. I continue to be amazed at the way the story flows in each of the books in this series. I read this book in about 2 days. I was sorry to come to the end after 700 pages. All I can say is that I hope that this saga continues beyone the third scheduled book.What a great read!!!!!
3,Great Inside - Bad Outside,"This product, while labeled as new, looked like it was run over a few times. The box was in terribly condition, and was even held together by some masking tape. However, the CD's inside were in impeccable condition; and since the quality of the box does not impair my listening experience, I wasn't too upset. Great product, bad shipping and/or handling."
4,A Worthy (and Wordy) Effort,"Remains true to the style of the Dune saga, with meticulous detail and descriptions of even the most mundane activities.Some of the dialogue seems bloated and unnecessarily drawn out, not as ""tight"" as the three ""House"" prequels, but what can you do? For instance, they could have spent more time with the followers of Selim and less on Jool Noret, but I think they are trying to justify all the time spent on Ginaz in ""House Harkonnen"" and fill in some back story.I look forward to the next book, and hope they can keep it all up to the standards of the whole epic. I was leery of the whole idea of trying to follow up the original septology by Frank, but am a believer now."
2,A Depressing Precursor to the Dune Series,"Unfortunately Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have taken the Dune series and turned them into pulp science fiction. There is the same heartless story telling and lack of depth that is endemic of science fiction lately. The authors go to great efforts to make the series an epic battle, a struggle between good and evil, etc. There are so many predictable turns of plot and story that I find myself rooting for computer overlords to win, if for nothing than to kill the more annoying human characters.After finishing the Machine Crusade, I pulled out my trusty Dune Encyclopedia and read about the Butlerian Jihad. I consider the encyclopedia to be somewhat authoritative on the series. ... I also looked at the lineages of Atreides and Harkonnen families. There is no corroboration with the stories that are told there.I would wait for the paperback, or borrow a copy from the library."
3,A Love-Hate Relationship,"This series of Novels has really torn me up inside. I'm a fan of the entire Dune series, and I really enjoy the premise of these novels. I'm very interested in seeing where the story is going, and how the characters will develop. At the same time, these novels are an absolute chore to read. Some character/place descriptions are extremely, EXTREMELY repetitive. When I'm on the 400th page of a second novel in a series, I don't need to hear about how ironic it was that one of the characters couldn't get pregnant, even though her husband was a pharmaceutical whiz who made fertility enhancing drugs. You've said that already! It's been covered! Move on!I'm not sure if the blame falls on the editors, but I'm surprised by this. I'd expect more from two highly experienced authors."
2,If it weren't for plot,"Crappy writing and craft are barely disguised in this ""episode"" of the Dune series. I find myself actually wincing from time to time at the poorly constructed narrative, but given my fondness for the original series, my pompous desire to feel holier-than-Herbert's-Son, and my almost juvenile desire to ""see what happens"" I keep reading. Maybe the book will spontaneously combust - I can only hope."
3,Entertaining But Empty,"I just finished this book, and I have some mixed feelings. First, some of the plotlines could have been done away with- Jool the Ginaz Mercenary comes to mind first. There was a lot of reading, with little payoff in the end. There were more, but time is short. In the end, I have come to the realization that I loved the original Dune series for a very different reason than I enjoy reading this new one- The original made me think, reread, and think some more. You'll never catch anyone doing that with the new series. It is, however, an easier, quicker read... Very entertaining to my Dune-starved mind. That may or may not be a good thing."
1,"movie script, not much more","Oh yes, the story is there, but o so tedious and repetitious. There is only substance for half the volume, the rest is the repetitions. I will buy and read the next book too, not for the writing but for the story. Please Mister Anderson. please stop selling movie scripts as novells. This story is behond you."
1,Is this Science Fiction or a Romance Novel?,"Very disappointing. There are a few good parts of this story, but they are buried by sorrow about lost romance, uninteresting human relationships, and tales of Octa Butler's supreme meal planning ability for her husband Xavier. For example, ""Octa did this as a gesture to him and her dead sister, serving the tasty meat glazed with a tart currant sauce (p 715)."" In addition in the space of about 10 pages toward they kill off four of the most interesting characters that they spent the previous novel and most of this one building up in an outrageously unbelievable scenario. Fans of other Dune novels should consider this one an ""abomination."""
5,they just keep getting better!,"The second book in the ""Legends of DUNE"" trilogy is complex, exciting, and full of surprises. DUNE fans will be thrilled to learn the answers to many questions left in Frank Herbert's original novels. THE MACHINE CRUSADE has so many storylines it's difficult to pick which one is best, but they are all engrossing and entertaining. Herbert and Anderson have written their own ambitious series based on the ingredients Frank Herbert left behind -- they are not attempting to COPY Frank Herbert. Great stuff."
5,Capturing philosophy,"This is not an ordinary SF story. It is social philosophy with depth, new thinking about old ideas and fascinating portraits of persons involved. The science is not bad either. I was riveted to my Kindle every day when commuting until finished. Highly recommended."
2,Wonderful ideas dragged through a slow and boring story,"I was so excited to read a book dedicated to the principles of anarchism! Where better than sci-fi to explore an anarchist society with a long history and highly articulated ideas. Who better than a highly accomplished writer such as Le Guin to tackle the endeavor? By Odo, was I disappointed.Le Guin's ""Dispossessed,"" while generous in its drawing out of anarchist ideas and events, left me bored out of my wits. The plot is thinner than cardboard, the characters are unmoving, and I could find little reason to turn the pages. But turn them I did. I was carried through to the end on the vapors of anarchist imaginings. But I ran out of gas far before I reached the end of the book."
3,Why is this under Science Fiction?,"I like sci-fi, and I like good novels, that are not sci-fi.This is a good novel, but where is the science? It's about 2 different government systems - think cold war; East v West and a person that is brought up knowing only communal type living who is transported to a world of free enterprise.It's a political novel, worth reading, but not that great. Maybe it's a little dated and would get another * if brought into the C21st, or even the future."
4,Imagine no possessions,"Ursula K. LeGuin always writes thoughtful novels about cultural and/or political clashes. This one is about an idealist, anarchist society exiled to a nearly barren sister planet of a predictably imperialist, capitalist society. If it sounds heavy-handed, it usually is not because it is really about the protagonist and the deeply human story about his two loves: physics and his family. John Lennon sang, ""Imagine no possessions""; Ursula K. LeGuin tries to imagine the consequences of no possessions."
5,A jewel in your belly button,"One of the best books I have read, especially in the Sci-Fi category. The contrasting worlds of capitalism and anarchy are philosophically expressed in this book, and are very eye opening. It is easy to fall prey to the societal view and images of what life would be like if we all lived in an anarchistic world, but this book helps to paint a clearer picture of what that reality might actually be like. The author, essentially gives us a ladder to climb over the wall of our own ingnorance, and see through the eyes of the characters a very different world and way of life."
5,The Best of the Best?,"A case can be made for Mrs Le Guin being seen to be the most important woman writer in English in the second half of the Twentieth Century. A review I read here which compared her to Ayn Rand is not only to insult her intelligence and wit, but to demean her style.I admit to a personal interest in Mrs le Guin's Speculative Fantasist (SF) vision, since I am myself an Anarchist. Indeed, I had never seen the sub-title ""An Ambiguous Utopia"" until I read this page. I do not think that the book fits into the ""Utopia/Dystopia"" tradition, but then, le Guin may be taking the Mickey out of us as she so often does.There is no other book, fictional or otherwise of which I am aware (with the possible exception of Orwell's ""Homage to Catelonia"") that so clearly demonstrates the practicality of Anarchism as a political philosophy. Indeed, I have lost count of the number of copies of the book that I have given away for this reason alone."
3,Errors in the Kindle edition of The Dispossessed,"I was reading a library-bound first edition of The Dispossessed, then I bought the Kindle edition.Oh dear, what edition was used to make the Kindle version? I find in the second half of Chapter 9, jumping in mid-chapter, two errors in the Kindle version that are not present in the first edition. It's hard to believe these were scanning errors; there's one case of the non-word ""princple"" instead of ""principle"" (page 300 location 4212) and a case where the word ""where"" is used instead of ""were"".I find that disconcerting, and it makes me wonder whether I'm reading an authoritative edition. It makes me wonder how Kindle editions are made. One wouldn't guess that a book published in 1974 would have fewer errors than its derivative Kindle version. It makes me nervous about the quality of Kindle text in general.Your thoughts on this?"
2,Do NOT buy the Kindle edition,"This is one of my favorite books, but I regret buying the Kindle edition. It's obvious that to prepare this edition Harper Collins ran the book through a cheap OCR and then didn't spend much effort copy-editing the results. Just to take some examples from the first few pages of Chapter 2, the protagonist as a child is described as ""a lanky eighty-year-old""; the correct text would read ""eight-year-old."" Later a character is described as taking ""a decade at the beach""; this should be ""decad,"" which is a word used in the setting to indicate a span of ten days.You should read this book, but not this edition."
3,"Wonderful Story, Poor Typesetting","My review seeks to add nothing to the positive evaluations that other readers have already offered. This story is simply excellent. I only want to point out for anyone thinking of buying the Harper Perennial Classics edition that the text is riddled with very annoying typos. For example, I was seriously confused when I read a scene about the protagonist, Shevek, when he was a child, and the text said he was EIGHTY-years-old. Since I was unfamiliar with the story, and since just about anything goes in science fiction, I thought that Le Guin had created a society in which eighty-year-old people were still somehow childlike. It took me a few minutes to figure out that this was not a part of the plot, but one of many simple typos (Shevek was eight, not eighty). Perhaps these typos are in all editions, but it's something to consider."
5,Best Utopian Novel in English,"This is a wonderful book, the best utopian novel written in English. The only comparable book is Zamyatin's We. The quality of writing is splendid. Set in a planetary system with 2 competing societies, a conventional capitalistic society on one planet and an anarchist utopia on its companion moon. The hero is a visionary scientist, a scientific revolutionary committed deeply to the ideals of his anarchist society. This book is one of the few that deals well with the issue of social obligations of scientists. It is a shrewd and often moving analysis of the necessity and costs of pursuing noble ideals and the obstinacy of human nature in the face of ideology. This is one of those genre works whose quality trascends its genre."
5,Viva Shevek!,"Like her Left Hand Of Darkness, Le Guin's Dispossessed is a sharp commentary on the insanities of human society. Yet what has stayed with me over the years since I first met Shevek is the integrity of this truly good man who stands firm in what he believes. While Le Guin pulls no punches when it comes to deprivation and human pain, I finished the book with a sense of hope for a hopeless world."
2,Kindle Edition contains abundant typos,"This is not a review of the content of the book, but the text itself, specifically the Kindle edition. I am not 10 pages in yet and have already encountered multiple dangling sentence endings and incorrect words (e.g. ""dock"" instead of ""clock""). I'm sure this is a great book, but I can't recommend paying $8 for an electronic copy riddled with typographical errors. Yes, it's perfectly readable and comprehensible, but it's annoying and I would expect better from a major publisher."
2,Definitely ambiguous.,"I don't think le guin was advocating this ""utopia"". Indeed I thought it was rigid, sterile, & GRAY. Meaning there seemed to be little misery or happiness. Don't get your hopes up it isn't that interesting to read. END"
2,Contrived and Boring,"Have you seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Remember the scene where the peasants explain their governing system? That is this book, but with the humor. Pages and pages of talk about government styles and philosophies. I suppose this was meant to topical at the time but it comes off as fake and heavy handed. Something else that seemed very odd to me; the author uses 'technical' terms for everything except toilet use which is referred to as with a certain curse word.Obviously a lot of people liked this novel, and was the main reason I read it in the first place. For me, however, it was boring and pointless."
3,A dire & dull warning.,"This is a truly loathsome world that was created here. It requires people be so self disciplined that they're a hair shy of psychosis. Give me the ""evils"" of a mixed economy over this any day."
2,100 Words or Less,"Le Guin is known for rich detailed background. That's what I found, except the societies in this novel are so ... blah.It all comes across as too symbolic; sci-fi as moral template of current politics. Like Rand-lite for geeks. Oh, she dives into the nuts and bolts of each world. Yet there's no passion. No intrigue. It's all laid out like a thesis, when it should be more of a fiery sermon.I only made it halfway through this novel, until I simply avoided opening it again. I love the detail, but I am pushed away by the sterility."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"This is possibly one of the most hypocritical chunks of literature I have ever been forced to read. There is nothing here to praise except an unlikeable, dull, and whiney man who is truly not as impressive as he is made out to be. The author tried so hard to create a utopian world where things were supposed to be so efficient as compared to the motherworld that she wants the reader to look past the fact that she gives Shevek everything he is not supposed to want or need. The whole story winds up based around a nuclear family and personal ambition, the very things that she tried so hard to make her readers see past as a cultural need. Also, if I wanted to read anthropological theory in massive chunks, I would go to my bookshelf and pull down one of my many anthro text books."
1,MD,Poor visual effect. Not worth buying this dvd at all. Because film is pale and blurred zero value for this DVD. I will not recomend this DVD to any one waste of money trying to view this DVD.Eisuke Akamine Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai
2,Broke After 3 Months,"After owning this product for three months I was forced to return it. When I first started to use the sweeper I was impressed by its quiet operation and ease to transistion from carpet to hardwood. The quality of the job is what I was expecting for a 40$ sweeper, decent. After the first week the edge sweepers stopped rotating. A few months later the sweeper stopped functioning all together. When I turn the sweeper on it echoes a horrible noise, smells of burnt rubber and the sweeper drum refuses to rotate. The problem appears to be internal because there are no visable obstructions. I can not recommend this product."
3,Bissell Perfect Sweep Turbo Sweeper - 2880,"I recently purchased this Bissell Perfect Sweep Turbo Sweeper - 2880 and was somewhat satisfied with the product. It does very well picking up dust and lint from bare floors. It does pick up pretty well on the carpet area except where dog hair is concerned. It says it will pick it up and it does but you have to clean the wheel off every couple minutes. The dog hair gets wrapped around the wheel and it starts to smell really bad if you don't clean it out every few minutes. We have a long haired dog which does shed so I thought this would be easier than dragging out the large vacuum out so often, but having to clean this out every couple minutes is a pain. If you don't have a dog that sheds then this vacuum is for you otherwise drag out the large vacuum out instead."
3,sweeper review Bissell Turbo 2880,I really like the job this machine does but I hate the design for emptying it. I have lots of dog & cat hair which it picks up well but the opening to empty it is quite small & I have to use my finger to remove the hair!
2,Big Disappointment! :(,"I already own the Swivel Sweeper, in which I am disappointed, and am looking for something that will pick up better than the SS. Maybe I'm expecting too much. I know it's not going to have the power and suction that a vacuum cleaner does, but it really doesn't pick up very well. We have a light- haired dog that sheds and we have dark wood floors, so it really shows. This sweeper doesn't pick up the hair very well, it mostly just pushes it around. I really wish I knew where I could find a better sweeper. I wasted my money on this one. Even worse, I bought one for my mom. :("
1,More work than it's worth,"Yes, this electric sweeper picks up some dust and lint from floor and carpet, but it spews what it has picked up right back out again. Even if you repeatedly empty the waste container while you are sweeping, you will end up with more dust and dirt on the floor than when you started. You'll either have to use another appliance, or a broom, to pick up what the sweeper has deposited or get down on your hands and knees to pick up what's been left on the floor. This product not only doesn't do what it is supposed to; it makes matters worse."
3,"It works as advertised, except the edge brushes...","It picks up the dirt, dust, crumbs and other loose stuff from the floor, just like it is supposed to. But I was under the impression that all of the brushes were motorized. Only the main brush is motorized, each edge brush is driven by the wheel on that side. I feel it doesn't clean the edges of my floors very well. Also, it is rather loud. It sends the cats running while my vacuum cleaner doesn't bother them as much.I will keep it and use it until it dies, but before I get another sweeper, I'll have to see it in action first."
2,Only for light sweeping,"After using this sweeper (in addition to regular vacuuming) daily for about a month I realize it doesn't have a strong sweep anymore. It appears that the brushes don't rotate, nor do the side brushes move. Since I initially liked it (it picked up dirt from a footprint on a rug cleanly) it seems to not pick up much anymore, and also leaves a lot of sediment behind when you're done. I kept it plugged in for hours when I anticipated using it so it was fully charged, I used it for both hardwood and low pile rugs, I emptied the canister after each sweeping, and pulled all the hair caught in the roller every time to free it up. I do not recommend this product as I'm pretty certain it either breaks easily or loses strength in a short amount of time. It's not worth my time to try to return it, I just advise buyers to not expect much from it."
3,Not so perfect sweeper,"Well, if you are going to call your product ""perfect"", make sure it is! Don't get me wrong, it's a good sweeper. Perfect? No.The ""brushes"" on the corners only turn when the sweeper is being pushed. That's a bummer when trying to clean a corner. (I mean, there's only so much pushing you can do in a corner!)It does pick up pretty good on tile and ok on carpet. I wanted it primarily as a quick way to clean my staircase. It's a little awkward to use on stairs, but much better than getting out the vacuum cleaner.For quick clean ups, it's very good. For a good thorough cleaning, it doesn't compete with a vacuum cleaner. Just know what you need before buying."
3,Bissell Almost Perfect Sweeper,"First let me mention the positives and then I'll mention the not-so-positive feature that made me rate this 3 stars. Overall, I like the sweeper because it does a nice job picking up, it's light, it's easy to move around, holds a charge for a long while and has no cord to get in the way. The thing I was disappointed about though is the size of the dirt cup. The cup fills up too quickly, and once it's full, the dirt overflows the cup, dirtying up the area you're trying to clean - kind of counter productive."
2,Useless on tile floors,"This sweeper works fine on carpeted areas, but don't count on it to pick up much of anything on tile floors. I bought this primarily for use in the kitchen and laundry room areas, which have tile flooring. I easily assembled the sweeper and charged it as directed. We have cats, and this sweeper picked up a small amount of the cat litter, but the majority of it was pushed into the grout lines between tiles and remained there. Regardless of the angle or speed I used to push the sweeper over the grout lines, the litter remained. If you are only using it on carpet or maybe even wood floors, then this is a decent purchase. If you want to use it on tile, don't waste your money!"
1,Ultimately Disappointing,"I was initially fairly pleased with the Perfect Sweep Turbo, as it did a reasonable job at quick pick-ups. Didn't take long before one of the edge cleaning brushes stopped working, though. I decided to take a chance and disassembled the unit and was able to get the belt back in place, but I do not recommend this operation as it is a real pain to get everything back together. And as it turns out I shouldn't have wasted my time, because soon thereafter the battery started giving out. All in all, I'd say the unit worked for about six months, if you can call 5 minutes of run time working."
3,only partially pleased,"I have had the unit now for about 4 months. I am disappointed by the lack of suction that causes the dirt to eject backwards from the unit. I puchased the unit for my kitchen and laundry area. I have three cats and the litter box is in this area. I find that the sweeper works well for larger debris like cheerios from the kids but litter take a few extra passes. It is not the best at the corners either. However, the machine does make a short order of sweeping."
2,Disappointed,"I previously had a cordless vac which I loved. However, it disintegrated after 1 1/2 years and I had to throw it away. This one does not come close to picking up my floor dust and crumbs as well as the other one. I do like the fact that it doesn't have the large charger dock as my other one, but that doesn't make up for the lack of efficiency."
2,Disappointed with quality,Used this sweeper for the 4th time to find that the right wheel didn't turn freely and the small brush didn't rotate. My husband took it apart to find that the small belt was all stretched out and not staying on so neither the wheel or brush would move smoothely. Unfortunately I threw out the paperwork or you can bet I would have sent it back. My intention was to use it for quick cleaning so that I didn't have to pull my large vacuum out all the time but if this is what Bissell is making I won't buy their products any more.
1,No so perfect,This is a sweeper with limited capabilities. It doesn't get to corners or edges. You have to pile your dirt and then use the sweeper to sweep it in. I do not like it.
2,I'll sell u mine,It's difficult to move the handle some times u use your foot to shut it off and it don't shut off sometimes u wanna start it and u gotta push the foot petal a few times.. If they would come pick it up they can have it back.
2,Not happy with this sweeper,"Pros: Lite-weight, easy to use, long battery life.Cons: Cat hair gets wrapped up into the coils and is difficult to clean out. Does not pick up all of the dirt and hair. Spits some of the dirt back out when you pull it backwards. When you press the off button, dirt comes out of it. I will not buy this sweeper again."
2,Not so great...,"I have had this sweeper for several months and like others, it's main purpose was to keep my kitchen floor, laundry room, and basement floors clean. Well, it does pick up larger debris best, but when you go for picking up hair, dust and dirt, it blows a lot of it around, not to mention, I noticed that the entire sweeper itself becomes COVERED in dust. Don't buy this sweeper if tou expect it to ""suck"" things up. It provides NO suction but a motorized brush roll that spins and rolls things up into the dust cup. I recommend this for occasional use for spills like cereal, rice, etc. As far as being a tool to ""clean"" your floors, you will be quite disappointed. In fact I only use this now to clean my laundry room area and basement floors to pick up debris so it doesn't get tracked in my upstairs."
4,Great Sweeper for Floors and Rugs,This is the first time I bought a sweeper and it was surprisingly effective on both floors and rugs. The sweeper picked up crumbs and dust on tile and hardwood floors. It also worked well on rugs but probably will not pick up pet hair. The sweeper holds charge well and will run up to 60 minutes on a full charge. The corner brushes will sweep close to baseboards but is not electrically powered. The dustpan can hold enough dirt and debris for about 10 to 15 ninutes of use.
1,Do Not Purchase This Item!!!!,I read the reviews and decided to give it try. Prior to this I was using the Shark which I loved but could not find anywhere else.. Anyway I've had 2 day and the brush on the left side stopped working and then the bigger brush stopped working altogether. The unit is also hard to maneuver and squeeks uncontrollably. I've repacked and its on its way back for a refund...
5,It's a must-have at our house,"I purchased the Perfect Sweep Turbo after reading some online reviews about 18 months ago. As a mother with a small child/messy eater, I quickly became dependent on the PST. The sweeper made life enough easier for me that I gave one to my sister, who also loved it and ultimately gave one as a gift to another family member.I replaced mine after about a year - it would not recharge. My sister had to replace hers, too, after a year or so, not sure what the problem was. But I think the fact that we both decided to replace the PST with the same model is testimony to how useful the thing is.At our house, we love it for cleaning our kitchen hardwood floors and for quick clean-ups on carpeting, too."
1,Not Recommended,"I bought this to pick up dog hair and small debris in my kitchen, entry way, and on the stairs. It doesn't pick up dog hair very well at all. It picks up some, but then it just pushes the rest around and leaves it on the carpet. The collection bin is not very big. I am disappointed in this product. Good thing I still have the box and receipt."
3,"Okay on crumbs, lousy on pet hair","I bought this sweeper to replace my worn-out Oreck Electric Broom. We have two dogs (one long-hair, one short-hair) and are constantly having to sweep our tile kitchen floor. This machine works okay on small crumbs, but it skims right over most of the dog hair or else spit it out the back side. The collection tray is awkward to empty."
2,Not very effective,"We have a very furry golden retriever. She sheds a lot. We also have a first floor which is all oak flooring. To keep the fur from becoming tumble weeds, we need to sweep everyday. It is tough to sweep under furniture well.We have an Oreck vacuum, which is corded, and loud. The Bissell Perfect Sweep Turbo looked like a great alternative to the vacuum and sweeping. Seems like it could reach under furniture and easily clean stairs.The Bissell works, but not very well. We only use it on oak floors. It really doesn't pick all our pup's fur. It has a very small compartment that the pet hair and dust fill. Once you have used the Bissell, it never seems clean again.It wasn't expensive, at all, so I'm not upset. I just can't recommend it."
1,Worst vacuum I ever had,"Alright, I bought this based on below customer review.It doesnt pick up anything, really. I had shark before this and that worked fine compared to this. Don't buy it if you expect pick up anything. Waist of money."
5,Nice Product. Does What I Expected.,"I read the reviews about this product and most were positive so I bought it. It does exactly as described. Cleans up surface dirt on wood floors and carpet very easily. This is not for deep cleaning as others have written but does a great job with food crumbs, lint on the floor, etc. I highly recommend it!"
5,The Best,I have bought several different brands of lightweight rechargable sweepers and this one is the best. All of the others were basically throw aways(very quickly)like 3-4 months. My first of these sweepers is still hard at work after 4 years. I have 2 cats and a grandson who make lots of little messes for me. I just hope Bissell never stops making this model for a newer (probably not as good) model. You will not regret this purchase.
3,"Looks nice, cuts not so nice...","This item sure does look nice... but try opening a can. 50% of the time a common tuna can can cause the motor to grind to a halt in the middle of opening. You have to lift the cutter head and try again. Usually take 2 or 3 tries to completely open a can. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. But it sure does look nice..."
4,Cuts well every time,"It makes a nice cut all around and holds the lid after it's severed. Sometimes I have to futze with it to get it started. I think that's just me getting it lined up right. Sleek design, looks nice, and doesn't take up a lot of counter space."
1,Don't Buy This Can Opener!!,"The only good thing about this can opener is the nice look, otherwise it is a piece of junk. It was practically impossible to open a can with it and the top piece broke after only a week. I repeat - Don't Buy It!! The worse can opener I have ever used in my entire life."
1,Manfacturer doesn't stand behind product,"Purchased a vinocraft cellar that was powered by a Breezaire cooling unit. When the cooling unit failed, the manufacturer (Breezaire) failed to provide warranty support, even though it was within the warranty period and despite pressure from the retailer (KLWines) because the cabinet manufacterer folded. Perhaps technically within the letter of the warranty, but certainly not the spirit. These guys are just plain unreliable... if they had a good product, they'd stand behind it. Given the comments on various online forums about cooling unit failures, I have to wonder if they have a high number warranty claims, which would explain expeiences such as mine where they attempt to avoid what most manufacturers would treat as a legitamite claim."
1,Don't buy from these people,"Do not buy from Breezaire, their warranty means nothing, and they do not stand behind their product. They will tell you to send the unit back at your cost, then tell you the unit can't be fixed for less than a new unit. Worst customer service I've ever seen, Amazon should not sell their products."
4,Please Be Advised....,"This DVD contains the two-part episode from Season 2 of the Highlander TV series. If you already own or are planning to buy the Highlander Season 2 Box Set, please be advised that these episodes are included in that set."
5,Love The Scent - Hard To Find!,My husband's signature scent - and I can tell when he runs out because he uses something else by Guy Laroche until I can replenish his supply. Hard to find! I'm not good as describing the scent but it's very masculine and distinct. Use too much and it can be overpowering but just one or two spritzes lasts all day. He still smells great after coming home from working all day. Love it!
5,Great price for a hard to find product.,"While wearing this FOFO in an airport I was sniffed by a lady who then sent her husband to sniff, at this time I became suspicious and turned to the and they asked what it was, I told them and we all had a good laugh!!!"
2,"just a market miss, Not his best, overpowering.","I actually have the 1.7 oz spray of horizion, thank goodness. Another scent that was short lived for guy laroche, whos best known scent is Drakkar. This scent reminds me at times of an older womans overpowering perfume, or the bad scent of original polo. It has a more mossy smell, and at time I swear it can smell like a locker room, not cool. Not close to his Drakkar line, thank goodness guy laroche didn't name it after it, because this may have stoped his sales. Something different, but not an every day scent by far, and use sparingly."
1,Don't Bother Buying,"The concept is great, but actual fun for the child is almost none. The hair is hard to comb and curl, it is confusing as to hot water/cold water to make the nails and eye shadows turn color. My daughters LOVES hair, make-up, etc., but this toy has been put back in the box and will probably stay there."
1,DONT BUY IT,"The barbie head is horrible. The hair is so matted and has some kind of sticky substance that you cannot comb it. And if you can get the comb through it, it pulls the hair out. It is a completely worth less toy. Do not waste your money!"
2,how is this fun?,"I really wanted this toy for Christmas, and when I got it, I immediately took it out of the box. The hair was a knotted mess. The comb is horrible, so it's just about impossible to comb the hair. The curling iron does work, but once you curl hte hair, the curls don't come out. The nails do turn color, but they only do that for a few times, and then the don't turn color again. The eyeshadow doesn't work too. Over all, this was a BIG dissapointment. Save your money for a funner, working toy."
1,RIDICULOUS,"My 5 year old daughter just had to have this. I had one when I was about her age and it was wonderful. So, I didn't even bother reading the opinions on it....MY MISTAKE!!!!! The hair was a total disaster the minute we took it out of the box. I tried to comb and brush it but it was like she got a very bad dye job and it literally fried her hair. It is not silky at all like the picture shows. When I try to do her hair it literally pulls out. I don't care about the money, my daughter's happiness is what is important and she hates it because the hair won't curl and she can't brush it. This is a total waste of time and money. They sure don't make things like they used to."
3,Great toy to play with your child,"My husband bought and opened this toy before I saw it so I can't guarantee that this wasn't his fault but the Barbie's hair was so tangled, it took me an hour to comb it out. The makeup and polish are supposed to come on and off with cold and warm water but it's actually pretty hard to make either of these work well. My daughter is only 3 1/2 so she doesn't really mind but I think an older child would get pretty frustrated.The hair does curl and my daughter has spent many hours playing with her so I gave the doll a decent rating but be prepared to spend time helping your child work with the hair and the water."
2,Too much wild hair!,"I purchased this toy for my 5 yr old daughter last Christmas and was disappointed. The makeup part and color changing nails was cute but to try and style and brush the doll's hair was a nightmare! The more it was brushed the messier it got and as another reviewer said, it came out in clumps. My daughter got frustrated with it and simply gave up after awhile. She now wants the compact Barbie face that you can put makeup on."
2,Try the Corolle Doll,"I used my own money to buy this doll. I was very upset because her hair got tangled up right away. So, my mom let me take her back to the store and we got my money back. Then we tried the Corolle Styling Head. It costs the same and it is great. I have used her for days and her hair is still like new. I don't know how it works, but the hair can curl too. I wish Toys R Us would carry Corolle dolls. They are great!"
1,Bad Hair Day From the Start,"Bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter as I remembered how much fun I had with mine when I was her age. What a HUGE disappointment! The hair tangled instantaneously to a point where it was absolutely unmanageable. We gave up from there. The idea is fantastic, but the product needs a great deal of improvement."
4,NO AFERICAN AMERICAN ONE!,They should make a lot of aferican american one for us aferican american kids beacause I see a lot of diffent one`s and what if we want it to look like us.me and my mom cant find an aferican american in any stores that why we came to amazon!
2,Babysitting Flop,"I was going to the girl who I babysit (she's 5) when we decided to play with the Barbie Primp and Polish. Not only did it take me forever to somewhat untangle Barbie's wiry hair, we needed to put down a towel for the water and it just created a mess. The little pieces like the stick on nails and accessories are just annoying and inconvienient. The way you can swivel the head around is just kind of freaky. The girl's mom says this toy will hopefully make it's way into the garbage- she despises it... and I don't think too highly of it either."
4,"Lots of options, but, please be gentle.","My 3 year old daughter recieved this as a gift. She loves it! It keeps her very busy very often. In my experience, the somewhat wirey hair does tangle quite easily, and after applying warm and cool water for the makeup and nails a few times, I was a bit bored. But, my daughter finds it fascinating. She sits and patiently untangles and curls the hair, puts in hair clips and applies the makeup. Although it comes with very small pieces (stick on nails, etc.), I think this toy is probably better for younder girls. I wouldn't say it's extremely durable, but, my daughter loves it. An older girl may find it boring."
3,Fun for a few days,"My 4-year old daughter got this for her birthday and was so delighted...for a few days. She hasn't played with it since. She has a Cinderella fashion head that she plays with much more often, because she can actually brush her hair- this Barbie one is all about the curlin', and that didn't hold her attention long enough!"
4,My 6 year old loves this toy,"My daughter has this styling head and she has so much fun with it! She is just learning how to braid and the Barbie hair makes it easier because it is not slippery. Yes, the hair is horrible if you are looking for soft and flowing, but that would also be much harder for a child to style. I had to help her comb it out when she first opened the box, and occasionally I'll comb it out as much as possible so she can get a fresh start, but all in all it's a good toy that she enjoys. She uses her own hair accessories on it as well as changing the nails and make up with the warm or cold water. When my daughter's friends come over, it's the first thing they ask to play with!"
2,boring and stupid,"i got this toy and i was so excited but as soon as i took it out of the box and started to brush her hair it got so tangled you couldnt even get the brush alll the way from the top to the bottom, it always got stuck the nails dont really work and overall the toy is a piece of junk dont waiste your money on it"
2,CREEPY!!!,"I was so excited for my 5 y.o. daughter to get her first Barbie Stylin' Head! She was tearing the box apart on Christmas morning without even finishing opening the other gifts, and it only took a few minutes to realize that this was a waste of our money. Barbie's hair is CREEPY!! They could've used one tenth the amount of hair and it would've still been fun, and with it being so thick and wirey, it is absolutely impossible to comb through. There's so much of it, you can't fit it all into a ponytail, like my daughter was so looking forward to doing, and it just always looks like a complete mess! Barbie has now found her permanent home, in the back of the closet, and will stay there until my daughter has forgotten about her and I can joyfully toss her in the garbage. Yuck!"
1,"The author from the review ""a doll is a doll""","Normally i would say get the doll it looks great, but my little sister got the doll last christmas and what a train wreck it was!i am desparately telling you avoid the doll at all costs, the hair looks like a birds nest after you get it out the box!get the classic small barbie dolls, or non-curliable hair styling heads!"
5,This is the bomb!,please this toy ......i dont know what to say it is. its so beautiful and you can style her hair and do her nails! This toy and the African-American one are so beautiful...I didnt know which one ta choose. but you should take a look @ tha other one!
1,NO African American Dolls,"I simply give up on trying to find this doll. There are NO AFRICAN AMERICAN dolls anywhere, however I can find the Caucasionone at the local Wal-mart, Target,and Toys R' Us. I notice that it is always harder to find popular dolls for african american children. I want my child to have a doll that resembles her, and that means we will be buying the Bratz doll head. Those are plentiful at most super stores. My mother-in-law has told me to order the Barbie primp and polish off e-bay and she will pay for it. I think not! There is no way I will give someone $50 plus dollars for a piece of plastic. This has been a disappointing search. This doll got a poor rating because I can't find it to prove otherwise."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"My daughter got this last Christmas. Anyone that asked what she wanted, that was what she told them. What a total disappointment! She tried styling Barbie's hair probably twice and was totally frustrated with that awful wiry hair that you can't even get the comb through. We also tried the nails once (that equals $10 per time she played with it). I just sold it at a garage sale yesterday for $2.00 and think I probably overpriced it!"
1,Barbie,"Horrible, horrible hair! If you think you have had a bad hair day before - wait til you see this head! LOL Not worth the money. We took ours to Goodwill (probably should have just put it in the trash.) It was nothing like the one I had as a child. Not worth the money!"
2,Very disappointed,"I have to say that out of all of the Barbie products I have purchased for my six year old, this is the worst. The packaging is very attractive. My 11 year old son had to help my daughter comb through the hair. The nail polish came off in warm water, and the color went on with cold water. The eye shadow and lip color never worked. My daughter was very disappointed. She asked me to exchange it but there are none left in the stores. The only fun she is having with it right now is with the fake nails she puts on her own hand. To spend the money on a product that doesn't produce is very upsetting, and even more so when you know your child feels disappointed with Santa."
1,don't bother,"This doll is horrible and so dissapointing for my 4 year old daughter. Forget about combing her hair you'll loose half of it in the process. I sware it is horse hair! The head popped off twice. And the nail painting is a huge dissapointment too. The makeup is a waste and I personally woulndt bother getting this, too much money and not worth it."
1,Where are the African American dolls?,"I have been trying to find this doll everywhere, in stores and online, and it looks like my nieces will be disappointed again this year for Christmas. This doll just happens to be one of the top items on their Christmas lists this year, and I am wondering if the African American doll ever existed. Yes, this doll is hard to find anywhere. However, the Caucasian ""Primp and Polish Barbie"" IS available in the store at Toys ""R"" Us and also online at amazon.com. I truly don't understand why it is always so hard to find African American dolls. It's as if we're not supposed to have the same dolls in our own race, so that our children can relate to them. All I am saying is that if you are going to offer a doll, you should carry it in the various ethnicities that the manufacturer makes them in."
2,The Hair is the Worse,"My daughter wanted this doll forever, so she could not the dolls nails. I finally found this doll and brought it. When we got it home and she played with it for about an hour, I spend about an hour just combing to get straight enough for her to play with it again. Good idea to make a doll head with hands but bad idea for the hair to be so tangled and corse. And for the makeup to be so awful, (I don't have enought time to complain about the nails)...Don't purchase this doll, it's the worse."
4,Need a larger amount of Ethnic Barbie Primp,"I know that there is an ethnic primp Barbie, yet I can only find it in one store and it is always out of stock. Shouldn't this be an indicator that people would like other ethnic races besides the white Barbie?!! We would like to be able to purchase the black Barbie and can't find it available anywhere."
1,VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this toy for my daughter's 4th b-day. I spent hours trying to comb out it's hair and it still looks awful. My daughter still can't even comb it. I bought this on sale for $24. and glad I didn't pay full price. I've seen other styling heads much cheaper and wished I hadn't spent so much on this one. As far as the manicure aspect, I am disappointed as well. The makeup and polish color change isn't even noticable. I am so dissatisfied with this toy that I am going to call Mattel to complain. There is no reason why it should be priced so high for such an inferior product. Save your money and buy a lower priced styling head."
3,Be prepared to comb for hours!,"I thought this would be the perfect gift for my 3 1/2 year old daughter & initially, it was. When she opened it on Christmas Eve, even her adult aunts were fighting to play with it! While the wired hair makes it really easy to curl, it is also the downfall of the product. It takes FOREVER to comb out a hairstyle and always looks messy. Fortunately my daughter doesn't care that much but it definitely bothers me. The makeup and nails are ok. I think one definite plus is the size, much bigger than the older style heads. Overall, it's ok but needs quite a lot of maintenance, and really, who has time for that?"
2,not pleased,"The hair is way too hard to manage. It is tangled all the time. We tried everything to get it to be managable.... nothing works.... might help to trim about 5 inches off of her head.... you would think that with as many people that are complaining about it, mattel would step up and ake care of this."
1,Nasty gross hair,I am an adult and I could not even get the comb through this doll's hair. How long has Mattel been making dolls? Do not buy this product!! It is a nightmare and the company should be ashamed of even selling it to the poor consumers who actually thought it might look like the picture on the box. If I could I would give this product a -1 star.
2,Bed Head Barbie,"I purchased this Style Barbie Head as a gift for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas last year. I was very excited about it, as my little one loved to style, comb and none-the-less rip my hair out in attempts to make it beautiful!! So Barbie was my saving grace! Christmas day she chose Barbie to play with first! After about a half an hour, she had the comb tangled in Barbie's hair, water all over and the stick on nails were in the doll's hair and my daughter's. She was frustrated because the doll's hair was VERY Nappy and hard to manage. Needless to say, I was the one, not ""Barbie Bed Head"", to get my hair styled on Christmas Day. We donated this doll to our local charity, my daughter willfully handed it over and said to the volunteer: ""She isn't very fun for me, her hair is very nasty! But, my mommy said that someone else might like to play with her!"""
2,Not worth the money,"My complaints echo the other ones already listed; hair being a tangled mess and polish and make-up not working. My 5 year old daughter has only played with it a handful of times. She will get frustrated with the hair and give up. She was very disappointed when the nail polish didn't come off like it should have. And,even though she got it over a week ago, we still haven't gotten her hair completely detangled. Her favorite part is putting on the fake nails but I could have bought her a set of fake nails for a lot less money."
1,Worst Doll Head I have ever bought,I bought this doll head for my 7 year old daughter and the hair is horrible. I would have done alot better with just buying her a real doll head at the beauty supply store. On top of that I was very disappointed that they did not have any African American so I settled for the caucasian one. The doll is very pretty but the hair is not worth the trouble. But I will go home and try some of the things that others listed.
1,Save your money!,"I bought this for my neice last Christmas, and the hair was awful. I actually had read the reviews after I bought the toy. So I asked my sister-in-law, based on the reviews I read, if she would like me to exchange it for something else. She said no, because my niece really wanted it. It is now a dust collector. No matter how fun your little girl might think this toy will be, save your money and buy something else! Imagine trying to brush through thousands of strands of fishing line."
1,CRAPPY TOY!!!!!!!,DO NOT BUY!We purchased this for our daughter last Christmas. By the time dinner was over that evening the hair on this doll was an uncontrollable rats nest and even adults couldn't fix it. NOW the important thing here is that this was NOT my little girls fault. The hair is made up of OODLES of super fine wires (all of the strands of hair). They knot and then bend around each other and can't be combed out. I HATED this and it really made my little girl sad when after only a few min at best the hair couldn't be played with. I am now looking for another Head like this one but with smooth hair.
5,This Toy is AWESOME!,I ordered this toy off of Amazon.com and it is awesome! The coolest part about it is that you can curl her hair and put on makeup. Another cool thing about this toy is that you can give her a manicure and they give you fake nails so you can look just like Barbie! This review is by a 10 year old girl and I hope it helps you a lot!
2,WHAT?????,"When I was a little girl, granted this was almost 30 years ago, I loved getting out my Barbie head, with all of her make-up, YES, REAL MAKE-UP - NOT WATER, and would make her pretty for hours. I am assuming they wanted to alleviate the mess of make-up by using water, but how much fun is that? REALLY? How much fun IS that? I am so disappointed in this toy, I wish I would have saved mine for my daughter, because, when I sold it about 12 years ago, it was still in perfect condition - hair included."
2,Awful toy-don't waste your money,I bought this toy for my four year old and it is awful. The hair is so coarse and tangled even I can not comb it out. The hair comes out in huge clumps and is AWFUL! My little girl is so disapointed and does not have the patience to play with her at all. I am so sorry I spent my money on it!
2,A Bird's Nest,I purchased this doll for my 6 year olds birthday. By the end of the day her hair was so knotted it looked like a bird's nest. I tried to comb it out but the hair started to fall out. I am very disappointed in this. I will be returning it soon!
2,hmmm...,"when i first saw this doll-head, i thought to myself, ""what agood idea."" usually you only find doll-heads that you can playwith by doing their hair and make-up. i think that if this toyactually worked, it would have been a good idea, and a goodinvestment. when i looked at the reviews for this, all i cameto see were statements about how terrible this toy was, becauseit was defective. they were all true statements, by the way.if you are looking to please a little girl, and give her thistoy, please look at all of the reviews...that's why they arehere...to help the customers. this doll-head obviously doesn'twork as well as it says it does,so think twice beforepurchasing this. you shouldn't have to do a whole bunch ofresearch to buy a barbie, but i guess you have to, as mattelisn't making very reliable products anymore."
1,The hair is my worst nightmare come true!,"How many times have we painstakingly combed through our daughter's hair, getting through tangles, amongst ""owws"" and ""that hurts?"" Well, get ready for the worst hair disaster known to man, or woman, or child for that matter. I couldn't believe the state that Barbie's hair was in coming out of the box. It looks as if its been out on the lawn, in a fight with a stray cat, and then left for rats to build a nest in, oh, and then I bought it! The hair is a wiry, tangly, falling out mess! Combing the hair is much too involved for a ""new"" toy. It should come out of the box detangled and ready to use. This is rediculous. The makeup feature does not work well at all on her face, however the nails work fine. In spite of this, my daughter loves this toy. I would recommend something else though, if you have not already purchased this toy."
1,So Disappointed...,"My 6 yr old *really, really, please mama, can Santa bring me this for Xmas, please!!!!"" wanted this. Her aunt gave it to her for Xmas and she was so excited. Until we actually went to play with it. The makeup on/off with water DOES NOT work. The polish DOES NOT work. The hair is SO KNOTTED that even I (mom) couldn't get the special comb thru it. We followed the directions and this is just a disappointing toy. My daughter asked if the company (Mattel) tricked us and didn't care if it worked like it was supposed to. DON'T buy this toy.From a disappointed mom,Lora B."
2,This was a real disappointment,"My 4 year old daughter got this for Christmas. The cold and warm water barely did anything to change the color of Barbie's eye shadow and lips. The nails were a little better but not much. By the time you painted the nail with warm water, the water would cooled off enough that they turned back the normal color. We ended up not using the water and my daughter uses her play make up on the doll head. The hair is the best part, and it was a disappointment. The hair was so matted when I opened the package, that I took over an hour getting the tangles out for her. She can get a comb through it now, but I have to come and detangle from time to time."
1,Hair is impossible to brush,My daughter got this doll last Christmas and as soon as it was opened it was impossible to brush the hair. It is all wiry and kind of sticky. A big disappointment and a shame because my daughters really want a styling head but this one just doesn't work.
2,NAPPY HEAD BARBIE~NEEDS A WIG INSTEAD!,"WHAT IN THE HECK WERE ON THEIR MINDS WITH THIS NAPPY HEAD DOLL. THE HAIR IS MOSTLY WIRE, SO THAT IT CAN CURL, BUT GOSH, IT IS A TRUE NIGHTMARE. I READ OTHER REVIEWS, AND GOT SOME HELPFUL TIPS THAT I WILL TRY TOMORROW. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE DOLL I SEARCHED FOR, NON-STOP, FOR 45 DAYS. THE COLOR-CHANGING HANDS AND MAKE-UP DID NOT WORK, BUT THE PRESS ON NAILS DID. THIS DOLL REMINDS ME OF THE DOLLS THAT YOUR DAUGHTER PROBABLY HAS, LAYING AROUND ON THE FLOOR THAT NEED TO GO IN THE TRASH BECAUSE SHE HAS HAD THEM FOR ETERNITY. AS SOON AS YOU GET THIS PRIMP AND POLISH DOLL OUT OF THE BOX, MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT GET HER MIXED UP WITH THE OTHERS, BECAUSE SHE MIGHT END UP IN THE TRASH, WITH HER NAPPY HEADED SELF."
5,AWSOME BARBIE TOY!,I highly recomend this Barbie Primp and Polish Styling Head...it brings hours of stylin' fun for all ages! :) My fave part of it is how you can give Barbie a Manicure...it is sweeet..This is soo fun and it teaches children who want to work in salons to style and Manicure...GREAT work again Mattel! Gooo Barbie!!!
1,terrible toy overpriced,"What a disappointment! It only adds to my general disillusionment with Barbie toys. Most of them have been overpriced and poor quality. The nails did not change color with cold water, the hair was an impossible mess and the ""makeup"" was nothing with which to play. It is to the garbage with this one."
1,This toy doesn't work.,"I purchased this toy for my daughter and was very disappointed to find out that the temperature sensitive makeup feature (eyeliner, lipstick, etc.) just plain doesn't work. Beyond this, the hair is a rat's nest that I doubt will ever be untangled, and it comes with lots of small, easily lost pieces. Unless you want to spend a lot of time cleaning up water, plastic, paper and fishing line, I don't recommend you buy this item. Oh yeah, and it doesn't work as advertised. Yuck."
2,Don't Go There,"I agree with Terry. The Barbie head we had as a children was much better. There is no fun in putting water on the doll to change the color of the makeup, which doesn't change much at all. And the hair is a mess from the get go and doesn't get any better with time. I have twin girls and they would get frustrated with how hard it was to comb the hair. Don't waste your money on this toy.Karen"
1,Dont waste money on this,"Sorry but,THIS TOY IS A RIP OFF!!!The make-up doesnt show,her hair tangles and is stiff,the stick-on nails dont stay on.I know that this toy looks like alot of fun...........BUT IT ISNT.Elizabeth"
1,Falls Apart,This toy has barely been played with and her arm has fallen off! It can't even be fixed!
2,Get ready for matted hair,"I bought this item for my 4yr old. It sounded great-Hair will really curl, but the catch is the hair is made of thin wire and it tangles for easy--most of your time will be spent untangling. I do not recommend this toy for small children since a parent or older sibling will need to constantly untangle the hair."
5,GIRLY GIRL TOY OF THE YEAR!!,"My 3 year old loves this big barbie head. It is much nicer than the smaller heads we've seen, and the hands rotate for manicuring. the jewelry comes off, and can be worn by my daughter, and the curling iron, which does not heat up at all really curls the barbie hair. I am buying one for my niece for birthday, since she wouldn't put my daughter's down. The only improvement I could see is real polish and makeup would be nice. The make-up changes with warm or cold water, but my little one doesn't go for that. She puts her own play polish and makeup on her, and then we wash it off.overall, we are really happy with this prduct!"
2,African American Doll Unavailable and Hair is Terrible,"First of all, I was totally disappointed that I could not find the Black doll anywhere. I brought the White one but took it back because I insisted on getting the Black one for my child. Anyway my older daughter looked everywhere for her in Black to no avail. She brought her the White one. The doll is beautiful in Black and White. Mattel you will not get any of my money if you don't make enough of your products in my race. It is different if you are collecting all races of a doll. For ex, my daughter has all of the Bratz dolls. But for something like this I wanted the Black one.As stated earlier the doll is beautiful but the hair is a mess. My daughter just looks at her in disappointment. I want a refund and I didn't even pay for her. Mattel should remake her and fix her hair and make her makeup more visible."
1,WHERE ARE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DOLLS?,"I CANT EVEN RATE THIS YET, BECAUSE I CANT FIND IT, WHY IS THIS SEARCH SO HARD,IF A CAUCASIAN MOM GOES TO THE STORE TO GET A DOLL AND THEY ARE ALL AFRICAN AMERICAN, WILL SHE SAY OH WELL, AND BUY IT ANYWAY?(I THINK NOT) SO WHY SHOULD I? (I WONT). MATTEL I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A GOOD DOLL OUT(BARBIE PRIMP AND POLISH) BUT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THERE ARE JUST AS MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE AS THERE ARE CAUCASIAN, SO WHY NOT MAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF DOLLS, AND ITS NOT ALL MATTEL EITHER ITS THE STORES ALSO, I GUESS SUBURBS THINK ONLY CAUCASIANS RESIDE IN THEIR AREAS SO THEY ONLY CARRY CAUCASIANS DOLLS,(WRONG) SO MATTEL MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS NEXT TIME THEY DECIDE TO MAKE A POPULAR DOLL."
3,Only B-side!,"I just got this today and there is only the Sleeping Sun song and the radio edit version of Talk. There is contradictory information on this page and, even though I would have bought it anyway, it was quite a disappointment when I opened it up and saw only one. :( Maybe there's a version out there with both b-sides, but I haven't found it yet. The Sleeping Sun song is great, of course."
3,"Great song, bad media","I'm not a coldplay fan at all, but liked this song so much I had to have it. Unfortunately, I don't like the sound of the recording on the CD5. It sounds tinny and somehow mastered wrong. Maybe it's the copy protection, but it sure ruins a great song."
1,"Disappointed, would never repurchase.","I'm not impressed. The light only floated upright for a few days, now it's lopsided and doesn't seal out the water very well.It's not very bright at all. It doesn't cast light and is not nearly as bright as shown in the product photos.I'd return it if I could."
2,Mediocre popularization of interesting history,"I agree with most of what the prior reviewer had to say, I was just overall less enthusiastic. Nothing really new. A much better journalistic exposition of the subject is still Hersh's ""The Samson Option""."
5,Real gaffers tape,"Bought a roll of this about 4 years ago, and finally used the last of it on a project. I finished the project using black duct tape - it is awful! I did not realize how spoiled I have become by using gaffers tape. Ordered another roll from Amazon, read the reviews of some cheaper brands, and decided to stick with Pro Tapes Pro-Gaff - same great tape I bought 4 years ago, and I'm a happy camper!"
2,Disappointing,"For what this tape costs I expected it to be better than duct tape, in my experience it is not. It is not waterproof as it quickly released when exposed to water and its adhesion was not very good."
4,Gaffers tape,We purchased the gaffers tape because it was good tape for our purposes. For the cost we were able to getmore tape to serve our uses.
4,Top notch tape,"I used this stuff with our band, setting up a a different venue each time we play. This brand of gaff tape is top notch. My only complaint is the stuff is so darned expensive. I've tried other less expensive substitutes and was always disappointed. This stuff tears easily, is super strong, stays put, and doesn't leave a bit of residue."
5,Worked great,"I have duct tape for heavy duty taping and 3M Blue tape for painting. However, I needed a heavy duty tape that can be removed when a job is finished without leaving adhesive residue. The gaffers tape fills this niche."
1,Unreliable and unsafe,"While this dryer did dry my hair sufficiently, I wouldn't recommend it due to safety and reliability concerns. Though it worked for the first 2 years, it began having problems when turned on, often whirring for about 30 seconds before blowing at full power. Eventually this lead to the more serious problem of sizzling smells and sounds from the internal heating wires, causing the dryer to become DANGEROUSLY hot -- as if it were burning up from the inside. As well, the heat-focusing nozzle nearly always fell off while drying, as did the back filter. In sum: don't waste your money on this product. I bought a Hot Tools hairdryer b/c my hairstylist uses one, and I've been happy with it ever since."
