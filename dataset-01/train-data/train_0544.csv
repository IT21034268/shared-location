4,Shutter Island,This book is kind of a mystery/horror story. I read it a while ago but can't really remember the details. This is basically about a guy (who is a FBI agent) who visits a nuthouse (on a maximum security island because these guys are dangerously nutty) to find the whereabouts an escaped patient. While on the island he finds out about some very shocking practices of the staff at the island which draws him deeper into the case. The book takes a few turns with a very shocking ending. If you like happy endings this book is not for you. This book (to me) kind of parallels the plot of the movie the Wickerman although this book takes the plot to a deeper level. What's cool about this book though is how the ending can be interpreted in different ways depending how you analyzed the story.To me Lehane is the master of misdirection. His endings always screws up your initial predictions based off the way he feeds information to you as the book progresses.
1,Shutter Island,Have read all of Lehane's stuff - this one was baddd !!!! Surprised his publisher went ahead with the project. Will think more than twice before buying his next one.
3,somebody help,the book was really good! i enjoyed it except the ending. was teddy an actual patient there or not? the ending just leaves you hanging. help
3,Read before watching movie!,"This book was really difficult for me to get into, but once I finally sat down to read it, I couldn't put it down.The ending is what makes it the best...the twist is awesome! If you love a mystery....this is great!~MichelleTeaching countless ways to save at: [...]"
3,Disappointed,"Well written but ultimately it is the same old twist, different plot..If you have read/seen the Sixth Sense then you have read/seen this."
1,mass production paperback books from Amazon.com,My husband and I both were looking forward to reading this book.The quality of this book is the worst I've evre seen !!! The print is so bad its a struggle to even try to read it. I'm sure the story line is good but when the print is so light or even missing in spots its hard to tell. The only reason I didn't return it was because my husband threw everything away except the book. That will end up in the garbage also ! I certainly expected better from Amazon.
1,A Waste of Time,When I finished the book I had no idea what happened. I had to go on the internet to get an explanation. A complete waste of time.
1,oops!,I bought this book on a friend's recommendation. If I had been in a book store and could have read a page or two I would have known immediately it was not the type of book I would read. I'm sure it's wonderful for those who like it. I passed it on to a friend.
1,Horrible On Every Level,"This book was so bad I could not finish it. The characters are boring, the story is boring, the plot is boring. There is absolutely no incentive to care about the story and keep reading it. About two thirds through I stopped wasting my time and wished I had my money back. The dialogue is lifeless, The story line is numb. I am amazed at the good reviews listed on Amazon because I found this book to be unsuspensful, uninteresting and unbelievable."
2,Middle of the road,"This book was film noir detective story for the first half. Two US Marshals are sent to a remote island mental hospital/prison for the insane to investigate a missing patient who seems to have vanished from a locked cell/room.The story makes much of the evils of American society in the 1950s, the mandatory little digs at racism and the like that any modern author must include aren't as jarring because of the dark detective doing a tough job at a remote hospital setting the author successfully paints for the first 1/3 of the book.The story slowly changes into a gothic horror and gets worse and worse in writing. By the end of the book, the 'shock ending' is pretty plain and expected. I felt let down that I kept reading when things got dark in the book. The ending was also just too neat and---I want to say smug but that may not be exactly it."
5,Great Book!!,95% of the books I read are thrillers and this was the first book of Lehane's I've read. Because I read only thrillers I know the lay out pretty well and can usually guess who they want you to think did 'it'. This book was fast paced and very entertaining and kept me guessing the whole time. By the end I was still guessing and the ending just blew me away! I highly recommend!
3,Of course well written,"But the damn ""mystery"" was way too easy to figure out. I suppose it's more about the thrill of it all and that was spooky. Especially when Teddy was in the water and felt 'things' brushing by him ... three things. Maybe it's because I read it in one sitting and didn't get it to sink into my bones more ... good book, wish there was more meat."
4,Good psychological thriller.,"This is a good psychological thriller, the best I've ever read in a book. It was a bit slow starting off, but I got through it. It doesn't start getting good until the climax. I give it a high star rating ONLY because of the marvelous and clever twist. The writing was mediocre and I there were time when I couldn't stand to read more of it because it was so slow and boring."
4,Lehane's Aesthetically Right Thriller,"I'm a sucker for post-war thrillers, and this is one of the best. After a female prisoner escapes in 1954, Federal Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule take the ferry to Shutter Island, home of the criminally insane. What they find is completely baffling. A former code-breaker in WWII, Teddy must decipher the missing prisoner's cryptic messages and unlock the secret of Shutter Island. This creepy place is enough to make anyone on edge, but for Teddy, it brings out his own personal demons: his fear of water and the loss of his beloved wife. To make matters worse, a furious hurricane is due to hit the island, and he's running out of time. Lehane's writing is so good, the reader falls completely under his spell. Many will be utterly shocked by the ending. The Publisher's Weekly review of the book said it all: ""it is one of the most aesthetically right resolutions ever written."""
4,Mystery Thrill Ride,"Shutter Island offers an exhilerating, suspenseful and well-written read. The tale provides plenty of second-guessing and unknowns, until the truth is finally revealed. There is no fluff, tangents or lack of reality in this book. Set in the 1950's psychiatric facility on an isolated island during a hurricane--anything can happen. This is a great page-turner."
4,Atmospheric and menacing,"This book had a great start. Very atmospheric and really draws you into the menacing atmosphere of this mental institution in the 1950s. But it loses its way and meanders a bit in the middle and so these parts were hard to keep up with.Finally, though the mystery kicks in again and grabbed me and the closing 100 pages were back to the dazzling Lehane form I know and love so well."
4,Not a stinker,"After the bad movie reviews, I thought the book would stink. It was actually worth reading. Of course, you can figure out where the book is going to end up; but it is, nonetheless, an interesting trip. I think it was as much about mood as plot."
5,Imaginative and Gripping,"This is a thrilling rendering of what might have been one of the author's nightmares: you know, the dream you can't forget, the one that needs to be put on paper. Of course almost everyone has most likely seen the movie which will create a huge *spoiler* for the book but it's well worth reading, different from the script itself. I couldn't stop reading."
3,Everything is not what it seems,"This story starts out as a standard police thriller, but half way through the book makes a left turn, taking the story in a completely different direction. It is somewhat like a twilight zone episode in that sense. I won't reveal the end but, be warned, if you are looking for a standard mystery with a case to be solved, this book is not it, and the end will leave you dissatisfied and cheated. If you like a more psychological study, you may enjoy this."
2,Disappointing ending.,"As others have said, the ending is a mystery story cliche, and not done half as well as other such stories. The most disappointing part of that, however, was the fact that up to the ending, the writing was quite good and the story was engaging, but I can't forgive the author for that ending. I won't read any other Dennis Lehane books as a result."
4,Glorious Non-stop Scary Fun,Just read this book. I picked it up at the airport. I've never read any of Mr. Lehane's other books. I COULD NOT STOP READING IT. I read it on the plane from Vancouver to Los Angeles. I read it until I couldn't see anymore. What else do you WANT from a book for God's sake? It's FABULOUS. It breaks your heart and pulls you in and makes you THINK. It's just good writing and there is no substitute for that.
3,Did I Blink?,"Caution, SPOILERS.Please, please, please someone write and explain the ending to me. I truly did not get it (and I'm not usually dumb)!! If we are to believe the ending, how is everything else explained? How did he and Chuck get there in the first place? Was that ""made up"" too? I thought it was very intriguing until the end. I felt duped."
2,Overdone Twist,"You know at the beginning it's going to have that kind of twist. But I kept reading thinking no maybe I'll be really surprised. I would have been impressed if Sixth Sense, A Beautiful Mind, Secret Window, and countless of other books and movies didn't have the same twist. The twist is overdone and I was disappointed. Boo the review all you want but it's true. It is an overdone story and way to predictable. I want to read something with a new never done twist."
2,"Nice plot, but cliches abound","This book has a great plot, which was later copied ad infinitum by numerous conspiracy theory stories. However, probably because of the times this book was written in, cliches abound. Specially, the repetition of the protagonist's devotion to his wife could have been injected in a much more realistic fashion. There are substantial passages in the book which border on ennui, which is sad given the fast paced intent of the author. In short, I am no fan of Lehane's writing - a similar theme would have been much better handled by Jonathan Kellerman, for example, IMHO."
2,Below average novel,"This is the first book I've read by this author. I have seen the movie Mystic River and really enjoyed it so I thought I'd give this novel a shot. I enjoy good classic western literature (Steinbeck) as well as entertaining/page turning novels (Dan Brown). This book is neither of those, by a long shot. In summary, the book promises a complex plot including government conspiracy and sinister medical experimentation, but this is merely a thin facade disguising a cheap plot twist mechanism that we have all seen a million times, which in the end leaves you feeling completely cheated. Someone else has said that the book reads like something Lehane wrote entirely over a long weekend. I couldn't agree more."
2,Disappointed with cliche ending,"I had heard great things about this book. I love noir and detective fiction so it sounded like it was right up my alley.While reading the book I was engrossed and enjoying myself. As a mental health professional, I found his ""mental patient"" dialogue unrealistic but generally short.Fast pacing and unusual characters kept me turning pages.When I got to the ending though I was just like ""What?""I feel he took the biggest cop out possible of a writer with the ending. No respect for the reader."
2,What?????!!!!!,"This book started out great and grew more and more confusing toward the end. When I finished it, I sadly had to admit I didn't know the truth about the events that had or had not taken place. The book left me confused and disappointed. I doubt at this point I will see the movie. If you want an enjoyable read with an ending that gives you closure, forget this one."
1,Garbage,"Total garbage! I stopped reding it halfway , got tired of all small talk and not having a direction. Didnt want to waste my time reading all garbage so at the end we get a Hollywood style surprise (OH, WOW). It is defintely written to be made a movie and not a book."
2,ridiculous!,"Another ridiculous story by an over-rated writer. The audio version is read by David Strathairn who swallows one third of every sentence, so be prepared to turn your volume on HIGH. Who is friend in this story, who is foe? Who cares!!!"
1,Tremendous Disappointment,I bought this book because I saw it on a list of great thrillers. That was a lie. This book was not at all involving. It was full of unbelievable situations and there was not real development. I always keep books but this one I abandoned. No more Dennis Lehane for me.
2,"A plod, not a scary thrill ride","I was disappointed by this book. A rave Wash. Post review hooked me: this would be a book about a fateful voyage to an insane-asylum island, where grim events would occur and long-buried secrets unearthed. Wow!And that's partially the plot on paper. But the actual book was a plod, became for me like a Zork text adventure: go to rooms, see people, solve a puzzle, go to the sea cliff, come back from the sea cliff... Where's the horror? And when the grand design of the plot was revealed, my reaction wasn't Wow! It was Huh?"
1,Unoriginal and weak,"This was the first book I have read from Lehane and I was sorely disappointed. The story itself was borrowed from William Peter Blatty's book ""The Ninth Configuration"" (also a movie). The similarities of the story line are so striking that it makes Shutter Island a poor replication of Blatty's ideas. Completely unoriginal and, for those who have read Blatty's book, predictable about a third of the way through it."
3,Lehane succeeds in a predictable genre,"Following Mystic River is certainly a difficult task and Lehane chose to write a completetly different type of novel for his follow-up. Shutter Island is a phsycological thriller set over four days and with a minimum amount of characters. Where Mystic River had a ride, rambling scope, Shutter Island focuses on US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his investigation of the mental health facility at shutter island.I know if I had spent more time reading each and every word Lehane wrote, I might have figured out the ending, but Shutter Island is too quick of a read to spend too much time on. Still, looking back, I can see how well Lehane devised the story and all of the action leads to the ending we get.Lehane hopefully has a long career ahead of him. I like is mugshot in the back of the hardcover. It looks to me like Lehane knows that he has it made writing books for a living and getting paid to do what he enjoys.This is a good book and I recommend it."
1,No Man is an Island???,"That this book comes from the same pen as the charming and throughly enjoyable series starring Pat and the Gang is amazing...I found Shutter Island to be pretentious, boring, confusing; there were few, if any redeeming qualities. It was not the good story told well that i have come to expect from this author. Bring back Pat and the gang in another excellent story told well.C. WilliamsEdgewater, NJ"
1,Couldn't get into it,"Ok, I loved Mystic River, but this book? I got about a third of the way thru then just gave up. And the first (about) 50 pages - I have NO idea what in the world was going on! Then after that, they kept repeating themselves over and over again. She was barefoot, the windows were barred, they were on an island -- I get it! I use to NEVER give up on a book without trudging through - but these days, I'm starting to do just that more and more. I wish there could be a money-back guarantee - - I'm wasting so much money!"
3,middle of the road offering,"Having read everything Lehane has produced,I was eager to start SHUTTER ISLAND. I 'got' the shock ending. (read Margaret Millar for the queen of endings) I understand that Lehane wanted to do an old fashioned gothic thriller. I also understand he wants to branch off into different styles. But this book is not the effort I expect from such a great writer. The book is not terrible, it is simply not worthy of Lehane. The depth of his other books reveal the shallowness of this work. The dialog is wooden and the plot is a bit simple. It is worth the time only don't expect Lehane's best."
2,No Fear on this Island,"This was my first time reading Dennis Lehane, although I'd seen movie versions of his books that I really liked a lot. What drew me in to reading the book was its setting (and the fact that Martin Scorsese is directing the movie of the book!). Investigating a supernatural disappearance at an isolated mental institution in the 1950's is an easy set-up for good storytelling. And it is for the most part. Lehane's writing kept me going, and I was able to breeze through the novel in a few days. But the ""twist"" ending didn't even try. It's probably exactly what you think it is, and it's such a letdown. I just wish the ending had tried harder 'cuz I was on board for most of this page-turner."
4,fun and intriguing read,"This is the second Lehane I have read, following Mystic River (before the movie came out), and I wasn't at all disappointed. The theme of this book is very different from Mystic River in that it is less realistic, but I found myself buzzing right through it. I was always looking to figure out the next turn. I am a person who bores with books very easily (I can't even count the number of books I have read half of), but this book really kept my attention and interest. The end, when everything is pulled together, is pretty brilliant as well. Looking forward to Scorcese's movie."
3,Not His Best,"I'm a big Dennis Lehane fan, but found this this book to be very confusing. I started skimming the first half of the book. None of the characters really grabbed my attention. The second half of the book was suspenseful with some really good twists. The book had redeemed itself in my eyes until the last two pages where there seemed to be yet another twist which took me days to figure out. If you are a true Lehane fan, I would recommend the book, but if you are starting out with this author, read one of his other (much better) books. True Lehane fans don't expect too much."
5,TEN STARS!!!,"Lehane, long a favorite author of mine, has completely outdone himself with ""Shutter Island."" This was one of those rare books that avid readers pine for...the ones where the last page comes far too soon.Taking a dark and surprising twist on the standard mystery/thriller, ""Shutter Island"" lures you into its story, making you believe you're in for a pleasant and well-written mystery. Somewhere around 2/3's of the way through, you begin to realize that you've been taken to a place you never expected, like the middle of a creepy, dark woods, and left to fend for yourself. To say what this book is about would be to spoil it for anyone brave enough to venture in....so I'll leave it at: READ THIS NOW! You won't be sorry!"
5,Outstanding!,"Lehane has written a suspense-filled masterpiece. You can't put it down once you have started and it is well worth the read.Plot turns, twists, winding ways are awesome!This is one excellent bood -- a definite must read"
2,The only book by this author that was boring.,"Lehane is a masterful storyteller and most of his previous books I rated as five star thrillers. But books about psychology is just not my kind of story, so it was boring and never captured my attention. The last fifty pages were the best part of the book, so at least it had a great ending.Oh, the book was about two US Marshals investigating the strange disappearance of a violent inmate. Once they got on this isolated island that housed an institution for the criminally insane, nothing was as it should be."
2,I saw the ending coming a mile away,"I'm shocked. ""Mystic River"" was such a good book that I was looking forward to my next Dennis Lehane novel.But ""Shutter Island"" telegraphs its punches to the nth degree, and I figured out what the conclusion had to be when I was a third of the way through the book.I'm not totally turned off of Lehane's novels, but I sure hope that ""Shutter Island"" is the only deviation in his repertoire."
5,Shutter Island,"I bought this book for a friend. It looked a little to spooky for me. However, she really liked it. She said she simply could not put it down."
4,Pretty Good.,"It had a twisting, somewhat surprising story line. I liked the book though at times the characters were a little hard to follow and swallow. But a good read."
5,Excellent Reading,"Totally enjoyed reading Shutter Island. I thought Mystic River was great, too. Dennis LeHane knows how to keep readers involved. Love the twist at the end."
4,A Good Read,"A good, thought provoking novel. The ending gives the reader the opportunity to go in more than one direction when deciding the outcome. Dennis LeHane skillfully pulls the main character from one ""life"" to another. Taking place in the 1950s gives the book a lot of flavor. The dialog between the main characters, Edward Daniels and Chuck Aule, seemed to fit the time period , as well. The only flaw is that the environment descriptions seem a little flat. A little more intensity when describing the inside of the ""fort"" and lighthouse would have given this book a definate 5 stars. All in all, however, it is a good read."
1,My thoughts,"I thought there was a pointless use of profanity. mystery part was good but too much back and forth, Sorry I bought it."
5,Believable,I am glad I did not see the movie before I read this book. I heard the movie was science fiction like and I did not picture that at all when I read it.
4,Twist of a plot,"Little slow in the start. Where I expected the plot to take me was so wrong, wrong, wrong. Much better plot than I would have written. I want to reread to pick up some of the clues that I missed. There must have been clues. I was dumbstruck by the ending. Good read and not gruesome."
4,Caveat emptor,"This is not so much a review as a warning. SHUTTER ISLAND is not a crime story or a mystery story. It is a gothic horror story. As such, it is designed to inculcate a different response in the reader than those other literary forms. As a gothic horror story it is exceptionally well done. Top of the line. If you are expecting something else, however, you will be very disappointed by the ending, as several of the Amazon reviewers have been. This is a departure for Lehane. If you're up for gothic horror, go for it. If you expect a traditional crime or mystery story, brace yourself for the possibility of significant disappointment."
2,not his best work,"I am a huge fan of Lehane's novels, having spent the past few months reading his entire body of work. But while his other novels push the edge of crime fiction to the boarders of literature, Stutter Island fell flat half way through the book.Perhaps having read his other novels, I am learning how he thinks, so the ""surprise"" ending was as obvious as an elephant walking down the street in a tux, drinking lemonade. Parts of the novel are hard to follow, but the worst sin of all is the lack of a single character I could honestly care about. If this is your first Lehane novel, do not give up hope, his other books are great and you will be well rewarded to read them all.Every author stumbles from time to time, and Lehane will return to form and deliver more great works in the future, he has all the talent needed to do so. But Stutter Island is one trip you might want to avoid."
2,Quite dissapointed,"I had never read a Dennis Lehane book until this one. I saw Mystic River, and thinking the book was probably much better than the film, I went to the bookstore to look it up. I saw this new novel there and decided to give it a try. I found the book to be a very pedestrian ""page turner."" I didn't believe the dialogue or the situations. It seemed to be predictably confusing, and all the way to the end I was hoping I wouldn't get the anticipated ""Shocking twist ending."" It's a gimmick that's overused. And in fact, something similar was written by William Peter Blatty; ""Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane."" Which he made into the film ""The 9th Configuration.""It felt like the author took the easy way out to conclude the book, instead of figuring out a way to make all the convoluted goings on pay off in a less predictable way.I won't judge the rest of Lehane's work based on this one, but I wish I had read something else of his first."
1,Very disappointing!,"Coming after Mystic River, this is a big disappointment. I found it tedious and by the time I reached the conclusion I no longer cared what reality was. Dennis Lehane is a terrific author, but this book is not up to his standards."
1,Kindle vs paperback,"I have a problem when the kindle version of a book costs more than the paperback. Less costs more. No paper, no ink, no shipping, no handling, no warehousing, more money: make any sense to you?"
1,Too Much Prose,"What could have been a great book was rendered tiresome and redundant by too much prose. It was a wonderful plot but is it really necessary for the lead character to profess his love for his wife in so many passages? I found myself flipping pages just to move the plot along. It was a page turner, but not in a good way."
2,Waste of reading time,"I thought the book was boring and implausible, and I regret the time I put in reading it."
1,So disappointed,"What happended? - I waited forever for Shutter Island to land in Canada in paperback. What a HUGE disappointment. After Mystic River and all his Patrick Kenzie novels, Shutter Island - well - it sucked. Hard to follow, could not care one bit about the characters - frankly - I was bored by the third chapter. Mr. Lehane - I certainly hope you were just having a bad day at the ""computer"". I hope that you keep to what you do best and that (for me at least) would be another in the Patrick Kenzie series."
4,Surprises around every corner.,My first time reading a Lehane novel. This book is full of mystery and suspense. Although toward the end I started to solve the riddle before the author intended.
3,What did I miss?,"I was getting frustrated reading this book as I couldn't determine the time frame for the story. Reread the beginning several times. Finally came to Amazon to read other reviews to find the time setting was in 1954. What did I miss?Not my favorite Lehane book, but will pass around to my friends with a sticky note that says it takes place in 1954."
2,Love Lehane; hate this book,"Lehane's detective novels are the very best in the genre among current writers. But this book is too gimmicky. You will be disappointed by the ending if you don't see it coming. You will be disappointed by the ending if you do see it coming.But if you must read this book, read it BEFORE you read his excellent detective novels. I read those first, and this book has left a bad taste in my mouth for several years. That taste can only be washed out by another Gennaro / Kenzie novel. Well, Lehane, I'm waiting."
3,All Twisty and Turny,"This book has a lot of twists and turns and until the very end I should've clued in but I didn't. Some smarter people will probably get it before it's over, but I enjoyed the psychological ride. But this book is not for the faint of heart. It has language galore, such as the F-bomb and their are some pretty graphic visualizations of crimes, sex, etc. But if you can enjoy a story for its story then check this one out. I won't be seeing the movie since I know that it will contain some pretty graphic violence and language and reading it in a book is one thing, but seeing it on a big screen is quite another! So enjoy!"
3,Will make a better movie,"With Dennis Lehane's excellent Mystic River soon to be a major motion picture, the author obviously got giddy with the big paycheck and wrote this ""novel"" as more of a movie treatment than anything else.As a book, it's just ""okay."" The ending leaves you thinking for a few minutes anyway -- but thinking more about who's going to play who in the movie. Appropriately cast, the movie will be a surprise-ending big hit, on the lines of ""Presumed Innocent."" I see Matthew McConaughey as the lead and, well, I don't know who else in supporting roles because, due to a lack of interest, I quit thinking about after a few minutes and went looking for a good book.In any case, this book apparently marks the end of a decent novelist and the beginning of a movie plotmaker. I won't look forward to the next one from Lehane."
3,Not sure Lehane wrote this one?,"Shutter Island is such a major departure from Lehane's previous works that I had a hard time believing he wrote it. Where is Lehane's Boston and the fabulous characters with which he populates it? I guess he left them all on the mainland when the ferry departed to psych prison in the outer harbor.Disappointment with Lehane's new approach aside, this was a good, but not great, read. If you're truly a fan of Lehane's Boston you might want to stay away. If you enjoy psycho-thrillers, you'll likely enjoy this one."
5,Best book I've read in a while,This is a terrific book with a great twist at the end.I plan to get Dennis Lehane's other books. This is not your average mystery/thriller. I literally couldn't put it down. Buy it and enjoy!
2,Review of Shutter Island,Not my style--wanted to see what the local author had to offer--not a very pleasant subject and told told in an upsetting manner. Writing style ok though.
4,Nice twist:),"This was a interesting book due to the twists and turns...as I read it, I thought I understood what was going on and then there was a nice twist that made it worth the read."
5,Great thriller!!!!!,I gave it 5 stars because it's a great book. I would recommend to anyone trying to read a good mystery book.
2,Disappointing,Lehane had a clunker with this one and I LOVE his earlier books. The characters were so much thinner and the whole story was clicheed and the ending obvious (and I haven't seen the movie). I kept reading hoping I was wrong and it would get better but it didn't. This one made me wonder whether his other non-Kenzie-Gennaro detective books would be any good and that was a dispiriting thought.
5,Shutter Island,Very suspenceful and you have a hard time putting it down. The ending did blow me away. Was not what I expected at all.
3,Good fast thriller... plot a little transparent.,"Overall Shutter Island is a good, tight read. It's not a surprise that the book was optioned for the movie right away -- the plot and description lend itself to a film very well. My only criticism is that the plot is a little transparent and at some points it felt like I was reading an adult version of ""I Am The Cheese"" meets ""Fight Club""."
2,Not his best by a long shot,"It's hard to figure out why Lehane has strayed from his Kenzie-Gennaro series -- some really fine reads there and engaging characters. Mystic River was a departure and much more of a main stream kind of novel with a lot of depth of character. Shutter Island just does not engage. I didn't care about Teddy Daniels, the main character, enough to care what happened to him. The novel has so many twists and turns, there's no focus. By the time I got to the end, it was more a relief than a surprise."
3,I'm Not Sure Why This Gets Rave Reviews,"This book wasn't entirely bad, and is good airplane reading material, but overall it didn't live up to the hype from other reviewers, and it certainly isn't five-star worthy. That being said, it's an easy read and initially very intriguing.The main problem with this book is that any avid reader with an imagination will easily figure out the ""twist"" because it's one that is repeatedly used in various thrillers. And once that is figured out, well, it's not as interesting anymore and there's just not much left to the story. I basically ended up finishing it in anticipation that somehow my hunch would be wrong and I would be dumbfounded with an incredible revelation - didn't happen! And some explanations for events I couldn't completely put together seemed shallow and left me feeling a little robbed.It's not terrible, I give it 3 stars, but leave potential readers with a warning not to expect grand things from this book."
2,"Okay, but just okay","I'm a little baffled by all of the adoring reviews this book has received. Yes, ""Shutter Island"" has a twist ending, but you can see it coming from a mile away (particularly if you grew up watching endless reruns of ""Twilight Zone,"" ""Thriller,"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" as I did). To make matters worse, it isn't a particularly well thought-out twist; there are loose ends left dangling everywhere.I was also thrown off by Lehane's numerous anachronisms. The book is supposed to be set in 1954, but there are references to items made of plastic, contemporary phrases like ""anger management issues,"" a discussion of the hospital's ""electronic security system,"" etc. Silly me -- I thought these were CLUES that the story wasn't really taking place in 1954 at all! Turns out Lehane is just lazy.""Shutter Island"" is an enjoyable pool or airport read, but that's about it."
5,Shutter Island,"Excellent book! It is definitely better than the movie adaptation! Full of twists, turns, and brings a new level of understanding to Teddy Daniels."
4,Three and a half stars Mystery,"This is a typically well written Lehane stand alone story. Just a bit too obvious for me. A good brain vacation book, page turner, but no Mystic River, and not as fun as one of his Kenzie/ Genarro novels,but Shutter Island is still good enough to keep your mind off of a flight delay.If you like detective books you should enjoy Shutter Island, but if you haven't read Lehane before, I would suggest Mystic River, or any and all of the Kenzie /Genarro tales."
2,Not his best work,"I loved Dennis Lehane's other work.That said, this book left me feeling like I'd wasted my time. Stories that trick the reader all the way through don't do anything for me. Just my opinion. If you really want to read something powerful, try his ""Gone, Baby, Gone"". It's ending is honest and deeply affecting. By the end of Shutter Island, I was just irritated."
5,Great Book,"In the beginning I thought it was a little slow and I didn't really understand what was happening, but this can be expected of any book. Then once the action starts I couldn't stop reading. Lehane has a great rhythm to his writting and his characters are gripping, but the plot of the story is what separates him from other writers, it sucks you in and doesnt let you out. Great book and now my favorite author after reading the kenzie/genaro series."
4,Page Turner,"Mr. Lehane has crafted another pulsating page turner. He is a writer that seems to understand the human mind rather than a psychologist that is trying to write ( don't get me wrong - I enjoy Stephen White and Johnathan Kellerman but their writing style gets to me sometimes). Like ""Mystic River"" he delves deeply into the human psyche. There are some very interesting twists that I did not see coming. Fun read!"
4,Twist Your Mind a Bit!,"Dennis Lehane seems to lead you down the path of a typical mystery/drama but in the latter half or third of the book is when the story shows its insidious psychologically twisted direction! This story is not really a mystery as opposed to a psychological thriller! Almost the way ""The Exorcist"" is supposed to be considered a psychological thriller and not a horror movie. Kudos to Dennis Lehane for writing a book that requires the reader to engage their mind and decide the true ending of the book."
3,Don't expect much,"If I didn't know this was Lehane, I would have thought it was a decent book. Having read Run,Baby,Run; this is a HUGE dropoff in quality. The plot is very simple, predictable, and fast paced. The only real positives are the decent character development and the cheap thrills. If you haven't read any other Lehane, don't start here because it is not a good representative of his work. If you have read his other work, don't waste your time with this one. Everyone has their bad books (or series, cough cough James Patterson) so lets hope this is it. Unfortunately, this is being made into a movie when it should have went straight to the paperback rack."
2,Such a disappointment after MYSTIC RIVER,"I listened to this novel set in Massachusetts read by Tom Stechshulte and he was absolutely the wrong person to read this book. He turned every African-American character into some trash-talking ignoramus from the South.The novel itself has suspense and if I had read it instead of listening, might feel more positive toward it. The ending was so farfetched that I just had to laugh.I need another story like MYSTIC RIVER to make me believe in Dennis LeHane again."
5,Superb,"My only complaint? That it was longer so I could look forward to reading it tonight (finished it in 5 sittings). Lehane creates such vivid characters and scenes that you can't help but get involved. I loved Mystic River, so I thought I'd give this one a shot and I wasn't disappointed. If you enjoy psychological thrillers with many twists, then this a must read."
4,crazy?,this was a good book not lehanes best. occasionally had poor flow but overall came together. it left the reader with deep thought about ones prospective in life.
2,Yawn.,"I don't want to give the ending away but it feels like I've heard this story about a hundred times. Nothing new in the mental patient/asylum game. Didn't care for the way it was written. Too much dialog, hard to keep the characters straight...eventually didn't care. Last few chapters were the most well written. I wonder if they came first? Did Lehane start at the end of the story and fill it in in reverse?I didn't find it suspenseful at all.Maybe the movie might be better w/ Scorcese directing. Leo DiCaprio never seems to make a bad movie so maybe I'll give it a chance... but only when it comes to DVD. Or cable."
2,A plagiarized plot?,"I love Lehane's books - have read every one of them. I thought I was in for another treat as I started this book but soon the parallels to ""The Ninth Configuration"" (W.P.Blatty published in 1978 by Harper and Row and taken to the screen in 1980 - Stacey Keach plays the lead role) became transparent and the end of the book predictable. What a disappointment! Why would Dennis Lehane jeopardize his reputation? How did this make it past the editors? And why aren't more people screaming ""This has been done before!!??"""
3,"Disappointing, cop-out ending","The first 3/4 or more of this book were very good. I was quite engrossed. The ending is exceedingly weak -- to the point that I feel cheated. Without revealing the nature of the ending, let's just say that it made the entire novel up that point completely meaningless. I think Lehane took the easy way out."
5,A real nail biter.....,"I read Mystic River years ago. When I found out Shutter Island was written by Dennis Lehane also, had to have it! Not disappointed in the least! Mr Lehane does it again only better! This book is hard to put down once you start reading it. So many twists and turns. And if you think you got it figured out...think again! The ending or final outcome was a total gasp! I could not have been more surprised!!!When I saw the movie trailer earlier, I was not impressed. Now I gotta see the movie to see if it gives justice to such a book. If you like suspense, intrigue, mystery, you got to read this book. I promise it will blow you away!"
5,Awesome!,"It took me a while to get into it, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. MUCH better than the movie!"
4,"Captivating , a must read","I opted to read the book rather than go see the movie. This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is believable. I was hooked from early in book. Read Kindle edition so cannot say by what page, but certainly within the first 20 pages. My wife and I have a hundred page rule, if by then we are not into the book I will not waste my time. It is dark and always left me disturbed. That is good the author kept me literally on the island. I think this is a must read."
3,Wish I had read it before the movie...,"I read the book after I saw the movie. Mistake. The movie provides too much of the plot, more interesting visuals, and a very handsome male lead to make the book worthwhile afterward.I do applaud Lehane for his book, I'm sure if I had read it before I saw the movie I would have been completely enthralled with it."
4,Written to be a movie,"I've always enjoyed Lehane's novels, and I enjoyed this one as well, but it was a far easier read than his usual style. This was a pretty straightforward story, without a lot of character development or local color which was prevalent in Mystic River. It was largely a 'visual' novel, with only the occassional insight into whats going on in the main characters head. In short, it read like it was written to be turned into a screenplay. I say a good story is a good story, regardless, but I did miss the old Lehane style of really putting you into the characters heads."
3,Sony SAL - 28F28,I am not very happy with this product. I wanted a wide angle lens to create a powerful foreground effect on landscape photos but this lens is not powerful enough to do that. I guess I need a 16F28 or less??
2,What a Bore,I have suffered less squeezed into a airplance seat on a cross-atlantic flight then when reading this 1000 page book about two insufferable upper class dimwits. The best that I can say about this book is that thank goodness I am done with it. I should have thrown it out the window before I reached page 100.
2,Almost as bad as being on a Mac.,"This program has almost EVERYTHING I hate about Macentosh. If you hate Mac computers, this is almost as bad!"
3,I Wish I Knew Now What I Didn't Know Then,"I upgraded to Win XP Pro from Win ME. Yes, XP is more stable and usable. But, and this is a big one, be prepared to carefully look at your existing programs. Norton Antivirus 2001 will not work with XP and the 2003 Upgrade has problems; I spent 3 days making it work. Office 2000 has several problems and the best I can get from the admittedly flustered folks in Redmon is ""we don't have a fix for that.""So, my...upgrade has now cost me the price of Norton and, probably, the price of Office XP."
1,"Can you say ""CRASH"" and ""INCOMPATIBILITY""","I must say that I stay up with the latest drivers and peripherals and it just about brought my machine to its knees. My printer still doesn't work and I have had to invest $250 to get my PC back up and running just to handle basic functions for now. As with all Microsoft products, wait a little while before you tackle this OS. You would be best advised to let all of us suckers help Microsoft fix the many BUGS in this software. You would have thought that Microsoft would have learned something about stable software releases and the need to test the most basic and popular drivers. And stability....my machine crashes more now than it did on ME. Good luck!"
1,Do not buy this -- Remote Desktop is buggy in this version,"I bought this upgrade specifically to use remote desktop -- however it does not work. There are many reports on the web re. Remote desktop black/blank screen no login dialog box.I have used remote desktop on other machines & connections without problem but there is clearly a problem with many connections using the version in WindowsXP sp2. Microsoft has not acknowledged the problem, produced a KB article or a fix for this yet. My suggestion is to avoid this until at least XP sp3 is issued. Concensus seems to think this is due to a poorly designed/implemented remote desktop protocol -- apparently it does not handle fragmented packets.[Some have found changing the MTU size from 1500 to 1400 using a third party tool fixes it for them. However this did not work for me.]"
1,The product does not install,"the product crashed while I installed it.can't see the point of paying good money for an upgrade that doesnt work.Microsoft tech support put me on hold for one hour, seems they are overwhelmed with virus calls relating to their software."
5,Microsoft Windows XP is superb!,Microsoft has again created a superb product! An extremely stable operating systems with all the built in features one has come to expect from Microsoft. I would highly recommend anyone with a PC purchase this product to increase computer power with only one great program!
5,A Worth-While upgrade.,"Finally, a Microsoft upgrade worthy of your hard-earned dollars. For those who skipped Windows 2000 and Windows ME, this is the upgrade you've been waiting for.By integrating the user-friendliness of the Win9x series with the stability of the NT code, Microsoft has finally created an upgrade that will make you feel like you did when you switched from Win 3.1 to Win95.From being able to control the PC from anywhere needing only Internet Explorer 4.0 to the much enhanced and tweaked GUI to the simple things, like being able to connect to an online game of checkers with having to do anything special besides clicking an icon. With WindowsXP high compatibility with tons of different hardware and software it blows away Windows 2000. And it's stability surpasses Windows ME by leaps and bounds.I can guarantee, WindowsXP will give you the most bang for your buck and may even perhaps build up your confidence that Microsoft can build an excellent OS after all."
3,Better wait until all the problems are solved !,"I have bought a new notebook that came with XP Pro. When I decide to stop it, it restarts and I've to stop it again, when it not starts after I've closed the notebook and keeps consuming the battery at best. The technical suport for the notebook says I've to reinstall the XP, with the recovery disks. But I could not transfer my stuff to a desktop pc running Window98 because XP Pro keeps saying I dont have permission to access the desktop that doesn't have any password."
1,Ripped off,The version of the software was an OEM version that was only valid when installed on a new computer direct from the manufacturer. It required a volume licensing agreement which a stand alone user would not have.Apparently this company was trying to pull a fast one. Don't buy anything from these people.
4,A Worthwhile Upgrade,"Just a word of advice, you must use the Professional Edition if trying to upgrade from Windows 2000"
3,Downward problems big time,"In and of itself, and for multimedia use, it's absolutely terrific. Best example: burn CDs while running other operations, even with files from network drives, unlike every other CD utility I've ever used or heard of. What's BAD? Very poor compatibility with older games and programs, that predate XP compatible hardware. If I still want to play DOOM or use some older business software that I still like I need to keep a 98 station running. And DON'T install it as an upgrade! Mouse/keyboard drivers are a mess. If you want to upgrade an existing station, verify all your peripheral drivers, then format your hard drive and install it as a new OS. Then kiss any software more than three years old bye-bye, and have a blast with Media Player and Quake 3. Oh, and File Searching is frustratingly slow, no idea why."
4,"Wonderful, but not for the technically timid","Windows XP Pro is great. Not only does it offer the benifits of windows NT's stability, but it's also as software-friendly as 98 was. I give it four stars because: registering with microsoft is a hassle. Also, if you buy it now, expect about a half-hour of downloading upgrades; long but painless. XP's (only) downside is that some things don't quite work on it. So far I've had two games fail on XP, but I found patches online that made them work. Overall XP is great, but you should buy XP Home if you aren't the best with the internet and your computer."
2,Display Drivers stop working after Upgrade,"After upgrading to XP pro, my display drivers stop working. Have spending ""chatting"" with Miscrosoft Support, but without success. Microsoft blames it on the hardware (OEM issue ). But Miscrosoft support were unable to explain how upgrading from XP Home to XP Pro can cause so much pain !!!"
4,XP = needs Xtra Power,"While Windows XP is viewd by many as a great operating system, there are several flaws, but the average consumer will probably never notice. If you're planning on upgrading to XP, you should really make sure you have at least 256mb of RAM, 512mb is even better. XP is resourse hungry and really needs more RAM than Microsoft states in order for it to run smoothly and eliminate crashes. It does require more processing power too, but this should not be a problem for most newer systems. I would however not recommend running it on anything less than a 1.0 gig machine."
2,XP Professional Upgrade,"I had Windows XP home and wanted to use the workgroup feature, but I found I needed the Professional version. I followed the steps to perform the upgrade of the Windows version, but I lost all the applications I had previously installed while performing the upgrade. Basically I had to install all my applications again. Then I found I was unable to use the workgroup feature without third-party software. I found a wireless laptop for less than the price of this software, sold the desktop unit and bought the laptop. I has Windows XP home and I am able to connect via the wi-fi router. I don't recommed this product for the home user with a wireless network."
3,Better than 2000...,"It is better than Win 2000 Pro (and all other previous windows versions), but not that great. If you buy a new hard drive, or you have to re-install windows on your computer for some other reason, it is probably worth the effort. I wouldn't run out to get it and install it otherwise. It has a few nice features (like user switching), and in general it feels a bit more stable.It is better... but nothing you can't live without if you don't want the pain of upgrading.However... my new Apple laptop is awesome. OS X is a dream compared to XP. Sorry Bill. But an intel/XP box is the way to go for gaming. Sorry Steve. :-)"
4,Windows XP RC2,"Microsoft has finally come up with the goods.The promised performance and stability enhancements of earlier versions seem to have been realized in this version of Windows.I found Windows XP RC2 (a version released prior to the retail copy) to be stable, user friendly and powerful enough for enthusiasts. Given its large library of native drivers, as well as extensive applications compatibility, I can comfortably recommend it to anyone who is using a version of Win 9X.Among disappointments were the weak firewall, and networking that is geared more toward using a PC as a gateway rather than a designated gateway router."
1,"Buggy, Security Issues, Many Lockups",Unfortunately I have to use this at work. It locks up constantly and security patches come every few days. Software that I need to run that doesn't have a specific Windows XP version simply doesn't run well under Windows XP. It isn't compatible though I understand that Microsoft had to make a break with the past if they were ever going to build a fully capable OS. It just gets old trying to keep my computer secure because they can't seem to learn how to prevent buffer overflows and the like and having to constantly save my work because a crash could come at any time.Either stick with the older versions of Microsoft OS's or switch to Linux where you can get everything - office apps included - ...
1,Windows XP - a nightmare come true,"Windows XP is the worst Microsoft Product yet. After installation, none of my previous software worked. Laplink,Norton Systemworks, Easy CD Creator, WordPerfect, my printers, my DVD software, nothing works any more. I now have to spend (dollar amount) on upgrading all my software as suitable patches are rarely offered. Moreover, as I upgraded from Windows 2000 Professional I cannot uninstall Windows XP. I can only reformat my hard drive and lose everything. What a catastrophe, the biggest blunder from the Gates software factory yet."
1,Need permision to use after purchase,"I have to ask Microsoft permision before I can use the product I just purchased from them? -Activation- they call it.Amazon.com has some great OS's on here. instead of Microsoft buySuSE Linux, or Red Hat Linux (totaly American)or don't buy Linux you can downlod it for freecan't do that with XP"
2,Support is awful,Mistake. I hope others have better luck with this OS than I did. I have spent most of my holiday trying to get my wireless card to work. On hold from MSFT for 5 hours! Techs would cut me off often.May uninstall back to 98 SE.
2,"OK, but not good.","The preview version of XP can be expected to be slightly more unstable than the real version, but even accounting for that windows XP seems to be no better than win2000, and just a squeak ahead of 9x. It inherited all of the NT 4 series driver problems, which have been toned down slightly but I still needed to manually install some hardware instead of using its automatic install feature. Not only that, but the increased complexity of the OS will create hundreds of new holes for hackers unless the user is very security wise. On the other hand, it has a nice user interface.And no matter what it tells you, you don't have to sign up for MS passport."
3,Win XP,"To be honest; I do not have this (yet), but I have used it.Stable: even in beta, Windows XP had widespread reports of being more stable than Win2K; this in itself is a reason to upgradeNovelty: the user interface is all new but is not a stand-alone reason to upgrade. XP's core is based on the Win2k code, so if you're running win2k there isn't much reason to upgrade, but if you're using Win9x/ME its a big change.Security: much improved over previous versions. built-in 'firewall' (thou it blocks incomming only, not outbound). Multiple user accounts can be logged in at once.Nuisances: the infamous Product Activation: not as bad as people make it out to be: it is NOT linked with product registration (which is optional) so it does NOT get information about you or your system. Privacy isn't really the issue, just inconvenience."
4,Best Windows yet... when it stays up,"I upgraded from Windows 98 on my machine, and it ran a whole lot faster. Unfortunately, Windows XP has some sort of issue with memory caching on my motherboard, so I had to turn that off (this is after about a month of crashing, I have over 120 uploaded error reports on the Online Crash Analysis site), and now my computer runs really slowly. I'm thinking about upgrading my processor and motherboard since prices are so low right now, but be forewarned if you are using an older motherboard and processor."
3,Better than windows 2000 but not great!,"I have demoed windows XP pro, its way better than any version of windows MS ever released, but it still has it's cons. It's true that it doesn't crash as often as the older versions of Windows;Sometimes when you install drivers for new or old devices that windows was not able to auto-detect, you risk windows rebooting forever to prevent any damage to the OS, but guess what! It will reboot over and over, and even booting into ""save mode"" doesn't give you the option to uninstall the ""devil"" driver, so far the only way I am aware of to solve such problem is by reinstalling the OS all over again, since the recovery option still is not able to fix the problem!"
3,Not a fan of XP,"I was an expert on the 97 Windows system and for the time I gave that system a 4 out of 5 stars. It had some glitches but for the most part it allowed me to do what I had to do. Once I stepped up to XP I liked some of the new features, and definitely liked the new look. However, I find that a lot of things have been made more difficult and the simpler ideas from 97 have been made more complex. Hey, my job is hard enough as it is, the last thing I need is difficulties from my Operating System. I do like a lot of the updates to Outlook, and I feel they need to improve on their updates to Excel."
2,"Pretty but LINUX IS BETTER, CHEAPER","Linux is a better and cheaper operating system. A free download (such as Mandrake 10) includes what would be thousands of dollars worth of software if it was a MS operating system. The GIMP, while not as polished as Photoshop, is also free (Unlike Photoshop for windows, which is almost $1000). In my opinion, I would rather spend $0.00 on linux and spend the money I saved upgrading my computer. I would go with Linux if I were you (even has an office suite that works with MS Office documents). You won't regret it."
2,XP=?????????,What does XP stand for in Windows XP?????? eXtra Problems!!!! From being hard to install to having to get all the needed upgrades for it once it is installed. Then it seems it likes to crash or close a window on me everytime I get online. If I wanted eXtra Problems I wish I hadn't got XP
3,Latest and greatest?,"I have read all the review pro and con for this pruduct. I have tested various beta's and this program appears to be ready for primetime. My suggestion is that if you are in the market for a new PC get it pre-installed. If upgrading on an existing pc, make sure it has lots of memory and a speedy processor. As a reference always shoot for mor than the minumum recommeded MS spec. If your PC is older than 18 months, and not up to spec, You must decide if you really NEED the additional features. The product activation is no joke. I would also recommend that you install any new hardware, memory, etc, before the upgrade. Too many changes, will cause you to reactivate via the web or telephone."
4,VERY VERY SOLID,"AZ is cool rapper, I think he's the perfect example of what a good MC should be. Although he's not the most unique he's good with the wordplay and he's top notch with the rhymes, very impressive. People should definitely not sleep on this album, if you know the true art of hip-hop then you will like this album no doubt.BEST TRACKS:Doe or DieRather UniqueSugar HillMo Money, Mo MurderYour World Don't Stop"
5,Classic Album,"Yo, I been listening to this album since it dropped and I bought it 4 times, cuz mad people cuffed it on me, and each time, I go out and buy another copy. It's a definate classic. It's too bad there is so much weak, commercial BS out there with people talkin bout the same ol BS in every song. Anyone that like some real rap, needs to pick up this album. I cant wait for Final Call to drop. AZ is one of the most slept on MCs in the game, straight up! If you don't have this album, you need to get it!!!!!"
5,Classic Album from one of the most underrated MCs,"This album reminds me of why I miss 90s hip hop. Ever since his guest appearance on Illmatic, AZ has been considered by me & some others as one of the best in the game. Tight lyrics, strong production, you just can't go wrong with this album. If your a fan of early Nas, Jay-Z, Biggie, and just 90s rap in general, this is a must have to your collection."
4,Alright condition,The book was in a fine condition. The only problems were a few tears on the edges which were mostly covered up by a cheap book cover.
4,McMillan & Wife Season 3,McMillan & Wife Season 3 has always been one of my favorites. I particularly enjoy watching the episode where the team goes to Scotland for a family reunion only to get involved with the death of Mac's uncle. Has a lot of who-done-it intrigue. Any one who likes mystery will like all of the episodes in this third season of McMillan & Wife. Very entertaining.
3,Borrowed Children- or Depression in the Hills,"This book starts out with Mandy and her sisters talking about trees. Thay live in Kentucky and all that, so ya know Her brothers hated ham so they ate at the hotel."
5,Divine influence,"This music is beautiful... It generates so deeply from his heart and soul that it feels divine to me. I love everything that he has done; I wrote a poem that relects how his music has affected me. I recommend everything by him.My poem to Lucio...How did you connectwith the universelike that?So beautiful, withso much love...Divine love.Musically, divine.He is in all ofyour expression;He lives in thehearts of allthat adore you.You inspired so many,and they loved you so.So many hearts affectedby the love you sofreely gave to all.And still you give thelove that He gives to you!And still you inspireso many. With His loveyou send us all intoa place that He aloneexists.Your gift to the world;your gift to us all.His gift to the world;His gift to us all.Thank you."
5,I love Lucio's music,"Lucio Battisti was a gifted songwriter. I keep Lucio's music very close to my heart. My family introduced me to Lucio when i was younger, but didn't start listening to him until i went to Italy this past summer. His style of writing just grasps my soul and takes me on a ride - of memories. For example, when I listen to 'Ancora Tu' on this album, I can close my eyes and see the beauftiul sceneries of Italy, for that was the place where i lsitened to the most Battisti. He is a genius."
4,Love the positivity!!!,This is a great way to get a workout at home. I love the music and Leslie's positive comments!!!
1,Too bad it has god in it.,I wanted to walk with Leslie but I was sickened by all the God stuff.The music was horrible and the bible verses were hilarious!I can watch her and work out with her as long as I turn off the soundand put my ipod in.
4,Inspirational!,"I've been a Leslie Sansone fan for quite a few years now but this is the first of her ""Walk By Faith"" series that I've bought. I love the beginning hymn ""Here I Am, Lord"" (also repeated a bit at the end) but I wish that all of the workout included more inspirational hymns to accompany the walking exercises. The rest of the tape has background music with soft tones and a strong rhythmic beat which are great for keeping up the pace but I would have loved some faster paced hymns with inspiring lyrics so much!Also, the sound on my DVD is not consistent. The volume goes up and down which is a bit distracting. I would still recommend this DVD, however. As usual, Leslie Sansone's workouts leave you feeling so good and energized!"
2,"Good workout, but may want to spend your money on a CD","This is a typical Leslie Sansone video, so of course it is a good workout. And if you just want to do the moves you know in a different order and see some different ladies in different outfits then buy this video. I own three videos of Leslie's now, and they are all basically the same workout. I now just turn the volume down after I know the routines and listen to Christian CDS while working out. I love Leslie's advice, but only the for the first week or so of having a new video. I thought this one might be different with Christian music in the background, but really it is not. I have a 2007 video (3 mile and 4 mile Walk) that I feel is better quality than this one. So if you already have a Leslie video, I suggest spending the money you plan on spending on this DVD to buy a new great Christian CD, turn your old video down and listen to your CD and see if it is not like a whole new experience."
2,"If you are looking for Christian music to exercise to, skip this DVD","I have dome several Leslie workouts, and continue to do them even though I am not thrilled with the music. This DVD has similar moves and workouts, but the music, with the exception of ""Here I am Lord"" is not discernably Christian music, which is why I bought the DVD to start with; it's some bad take on Disco music. ""Here I Am Lord"" is not music that fits in very well with the workout either. At he beginning of the DVD when the song is used, there is no beat to work out to. In short, if you need a different workout DVD this DVD weuld be OK but do not buy it if you are interested in working out to Christian music."
1,Worst movie ever,This is with out a doubt the WORST movie ever made. Don't make the mistake of being misled by the description on the cover. My husband is now forbidden from ever buying movies with out me present.
1,Not worth the time or money,"If Kristol can be considered the godfather of Neo-conservatism, then you can go ahead and call me Jesus Christ. The book is vague and it seems as if he is trying to explain this concept to children. SELF INDULGENT IDIOTS GUIDE TO WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED NEO-CONSERVATISM. Stay away from this book."
3,Not bad as long as you're not growing too much,"This is a decent product with some useful features but it is not overly sophisticated. It is limited to 4 users and does not work among users in ""real time"" - it must be synced up to a central database before you can get an updated copy. That process can occasionally get messy. I am currently moving to a much more robust system as my company and needs have grown. Also this program requires double entry into quickbooks to create an invoice if you are tracking appointments and things like that."
1,Amazon does not have a 0 star rating.,"I have used Quicken & Quickbooks products since the early 90's. I have purchased several add on products during that time.Quicken & Quickbooks started out as great products but have declined greatly in the last few years. They also offer extra cost products on many of their ""upgrades"" which were included in earlier products for free.Customer Manager is a different issue. I started out with version 1. Description on box seemed to offer a usefull product. However, the program was so limited that it made more work than it eliminated. Like a fool I bought V2 when it came out because the concept seemed good & many improvements were promised. I was wrong. It has more bugs, hardly any real improvements than V1. The feature for sending e-mails is worse than useless. It takes several steps to put it into history and often doesn't work at all. You can see from all the other reviews that there are lots of other issues as well. I have experienced them as well."
1,Do not buy!,"The price is good, but I guess you get what you pay for. It works fine for a while then it screws up and you can't use it anymore. You click on it and it gives you this garbage and it won't open. I had to uninstall and reinstall. Inuit was helpful, but it didn't solve the problem. I don't understand how a big company can make such crap. We have no problems with quickbooks, but customer manager is just a waste of our time and computer space."
1,"I wish I had that slow, unstable, featureless version","Spare a thought for us international users, who can't even get the slow, unstable and featureless version 2.0 of the product.I am based in Ireland, and so require the UK version of this product to integrate with Quickbooks. Unlike the US version, this costs 200 euros per person, three times the price of the US version.To add to the insult, only version 1.0 is available in the UK. The difference is, version 1.0 does not synchronise emails. I know a team member sent an email, but I can't see it. This product has zero value. It is a shared address book.I contacted Quickbooks support (April 2005), and was informed that they ""are not shipping version 2.0 in the UK, because they only started shipping versin 1.0 in September."" This out of date version is clearly selling like a dog, but they will wait until the shelves clear before shipping the 2004 version. With luck, that will be out of date by then too."
2,Needs to remain silent,"While I respect Dr. Baden and his expertise as forensic expert, I am at a loss as to how he got this book published. I will not belabor this subject except to say there are some excellent forensic novelists to choose from and this book falls short. I simply could not finish it."
3,I expected better.,Attorney Philomena Manfreda and Dr. Jake Rosen are likable characters and I enjoyed their interplay -- and foreplay. But the plot grew more and more unlikely as it went along. Dr. Baden is familiar with southeastern New York State so was he being intentionally humorous or does he really think that we hunt elk here?
3,Don't take it too seriously,"I really enjoyed this book! From the first couple chapters you can tell it will be slightly cheesy, but who cares? For a first book written by two non-authors I think they did fine (although the editors could have caught some mistakes better). It is an exciting read and I had trouble putting it down until I was done. Worth it for the entertainment, just don't look too much into it."
1,Awful!,"This book was just awful! Boring from beginning to end. The main female character, Manny, was totally unlikeable. I just couldn't care about her opinions or thoughts in any way. She was shallow and ridiculous. And the whole subject was simply uninteresting. Don't waste your time or money on this book. Try a John Sandford or Phillip Margolin instead."
2,Remains Silent,"""Remains Silent"" is silly rather than interesting because the two authors have put so much emphasis on the superficiality of the female lawyer who is obsessed with designer clothing of every sort, her fingernail polish, her makeup and anything else they can think of. The idea is a good one but spoiled by too much silly behavior on the part of the chief characters. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Remains Silent,"I guess I missed something after reading some of the other reviews of this book because I really enjoyed it. It has been a long time since I sat down and read a book ""straight through"" in one sitting. The ending seemed a bit ""off"" but none the less, it was a good read!I'd recommend it!"
3,A good quick read,"It's possible to visualize the authors as the crime-fighting couple Jake Rosen and Philomena ""Manny"" Manfreda. They admit to this correlation ""except the main characters are a little younger and thinner,"" confides Baden. Their dog is also named Mycroft. The real couple also met in an autopsy room, she in stilettos and a Gucci purse and not wanting to don the shapeless surgical scrubs, her husband chuckles.Because of Baden's forensic expertise, the morgue scenes and autopsy descriptions are convincing and absorbing. This is the way murder really looks. The plot is fast-paced and unpredictable although the characters are a little thin. It's not easy to have a great deal of feeling for them, only interest. The asides in italics by both characters add to their dimension and the humor. It's a fascinating partnership."
4,Interesting work of fiction from Dr. Baden,"Remains Silent is an interesting work of fiction by one of the foremost forensic pathologists in the country. Bringing his vast knowledge and experience to this book, Baden has created a very believable character in Dr. Jack Rosen and pulls a story together that will entertain with each page.While Baden walks us through the business of death and getting to the truth through the dead, he also takes us on an investigation with twist and turns that keep the reader guessing.There is one part that I did not like about this book and that was the ending. It seemed that while Baden and his wife were great story tellers and walking us through the crime and the investigation, there were only 5 pages spent on pulling the crime together and the explanation. It would have made a 5 star book if this part was a bit better.All and all an enjoyable book that will keep you guessing."
4,Good Read,"The book was purchased for my daughter, and she enjoyed it thoroughly and is awaiting the next book by the author."
5,An great soundtrack that transcends retro nostalgia,"This disc evokes a sense of place, time, mood and drama as any good soundtrack should...but most don't. While containing only one piece scored specifically for the movie (Danny Elfman's eerie, ominous title theme), the chosen tracks perfectly serve the film by going beyond the obvious retro standards to those true timeless gems that sound great and project the perfect the atmosphere for this passionate, tragic story."
4,Its like a flashback to New York in the 70's,Great album with a laid back sound and feel of what was happ'nin back in the day! Issac Hayes tracks are my favorite!
5,I love it!!!!!,This product is great for acne prone skin. It could be better at removing makeup but overall I love it and it controls oily skin really well. Highly recommended
4,IT WORKS GREAT,I've used Turbotax since before Clipsoft merged with Intuit. This has been the best year yet and I thought the first one was great. Why pay a CPA? This is easy.
1,A WASTE OF MY $$$$$$,I used Turbo Tax for the past two years with no problems so when it was tax time again I bought the new edition. What a mistake! After spending three hours trying to get the program to understand what the zip code for my employer was with no luck I gave up. Because of this I could not e-file. HELP is no HELP so don't even bother!! I ran out and bought TAXCUT and was quickly and seamlessly able to e-file with no problems. I recommend it as hassle free. And yes Turbo Tax did insert a spy bot named cdilla into my computer that webroot spysweeper found!Don't waste your money on this year's Turbotax.
2,TurboTax Spyware,"In response to questions regarding TurboTax & Spyware.Judge for yourself before buying this product by doing a search using ""turbotax"" and ""C-Dilla"".Look at the results from legitimate sites...I will not purchase any product from any company who uses or has used hidden spyware of this caliber in their products. PLEASE do the same. Money talks very loud. Again, please take 5 minutes & judge for yourself. I chose 2 stars due to the fact I must select something & this is close to the mean."
2,Turbo Tax Basic? Not!,"When I purchased Turbo Tax software basic, I had tried Turbo Tax before in the previous of tax years. When I first started out, I could definitely tell the difference from doing the job by hand. I received more money back from my return than I would have done so by hand using my state's 1040EZ form. The program went well the first couple of years. Suddenly, this previous year, after a purchase from Wal-Mart I began to have problems:* Trying to install the software was a major hassle. The security code that came with the software purchase did not work and after weeks worth of e-mailings I finally got to install the software completely.* After the installation and performing all of the work and calculations, I STILL did not receive the kind of deducted refund expected from the bank (after paying bank charges and tax fees) which had taken over half of my refund.Turbo Tax Basic an excellent software...asta la vista, baby! I am going to Tax Cut this year!"
1,Version degradation,"I've happily used TTax Basic for four years - but this year the functionality is much narrower than in past years, forcing a Premier upgrade to get some of the stock and Schedule C options.2004 was my last year with TurboTax. Goodbye!"
3,Good basic functionality but...,"...each year it gets a little more cluttered with advertising, & licensing garbage. Also, there are too many different products making it difficult to choose the right one each year -- wish they would just sell one product that did the job!! The software also seems a little less helpful each year."
1,Why did I do this again???,"I had written a review on a previous version of TurboTax when that little program installed C-Dilla without my permission or knowledge. Never again, I told myself. I should have listened to myself!Imagine my surprise when after installing TurboTax I decided to run Webroot SpySweeper. Hmm...my machine was clean prior to the installation so what could this one little program have done?...Plenty! Right after the install, SpySweeper found 1 file and 26 instances of BonziBuddy splattered all over my system! Are you kidding me??When will this company learn? Actually, when will I learn to STOP TRUSTING INTUIT!"
2,Heartbreaking...,"I saw this movie on cable, the unrated version and I just about lost control! It is excellent, very sensual. THIS version fades to black at every love scene. Heavily edited and very disappointing. I hope the unrated version is available or coming to DVD. This one is not worth it."
2,Good as a B-movie,This movie has a standard b-movie plot with sub standard acting. However it does have enough nudity and erotic scenes to justify buying for anyone who likes this stuff. Athena Massey herself is in 4 explicit sex scenes. But it's only worth it to buy the unrated version. So buy VHS to be worth the money.
2,Undercover,"The so called NR dvd you see above is not NR. If the racey seens were left intact,as in the true NR version, this movie is hot as it were intended by the producers. This R rated version is like watching an R rated version of a XXX movie. Totally worthless"
1,They dare call this a collectors edition?,"I've seen the video, and don't remember it being classed as not rated, so naturally I didn't know this edition would be cut to shreads. The main question is how they can call this a collectors edition when in fact at some of the scenes are edited so you don't see anything.? You would figure if anything the collectors edition would be fairly complete... I usually don't read the reviews as I usually don't find them informitive... guess I will change my ways now...Your better off finding a Not Rated verison of the video, if you like this movie."
3,Undercover Heat,"Not much of a story, but if you want to see Athena Massey naked, this is the movie to buy."
3,A Seekers Journal,"Yet another Kundalini book to read. Even though it is new to me, it was published quite awhile ago. I wouldn't say it is a very good book on the subject nor a bad book. It is the authors journal of what he experienced, and he is quite good at verbally expressing what he was going through and how he was dealing with it.I bought the book after watching his youtube videos which I find quite interesting.If you want a first book on Kundalini I wouldn't recommend this book. But if your looking to read all you can on the subject then I would say add it to your library."
4,Entertaining!,I really liked this film. It was very interesting. The acting was excellent! surprisingly it enlightened me! I recommend it
2,Avid Reader - Disappointed,"Cooks Overboard was a disappointment compared to other Angie Amalfi Mysteries. There were very few cooking references along with a half-cooked plot. The characters were under developed, and yet overly simplistic in their predictable actions. I had the ""bad person"" of this book figured out way to early to truly enjoy it.I was looking for another quality mystery and found little more than an exercise in reading."
3,Okay,"Maybe it was because I could only read it whenever I could get a few hard won free minutes or maybe it was because I really don't like spy books. Whatever the reason, I did not think this one was as good as her past books. Those I could not put down once started. I made time for reading them. This one I wasn't as compelled to find time. Still, a good read."
1,Ridiculous!,"I actually read the books previous to this in the series- but this book I had to resort to skimming because so much was farfetched. Having Angie randomly spout theory about science... which so conveniently happens to tie to the mystery? I appreciated the attempt to actually have Angie to the rescue instead of Paavo, as usual, but it was so ridiculous that this book made me wonder how much Pence thinks readers can suspend our disbelief and just swallow all this craziness. She again tries to draw out some other characters but they are shallow and forgettable. And Pence must realize it- the next book is A Cook In Time which is when she begins adding a couple of Angie's recipes at the end of the book to try to make up for how full of holes her stores are starting to become. Maybe she was trying too hard to go the Evanovich path. This book is probably one of the worst in the series."
5,Amazing Stuff!,"This stuff is amazing!I received a 2nd degree burn on my hand in an industrial fire. After dousing my hand with water for about 10 minutes there was absolutely no relief. My hand felt like it was still in contact with the molten plastic that caused the injury.The first aid kit at work had this stuff in it. Although I have heard the advice: ""Do not use creams or salves,"" I was desperate and smeared this gel on.Within seconds, the pain was GONE. And the redness disappeared within 12 hours.I now carry it in my personal first aid kit for camping."
3,unsure of effectiveness,"Perhaps I was supposed to slather this stuff on really thick, but I got a mild burn from some hot sappy stuff in the kitchen. I put this on but didn't find immediate relief. I found better relief in holding my finger under running cold water for 5 minutes."
5,Fast relief!,"I bought one box of these and they came in so handy! We had 25 and we used most fo those in the first 5 months on cooking burns... what can I say...I'm learning. It works so fast, and I have NO scars from the burns. I need to buy some more."
2,Not effective on 'jalapeno pepper' burn,I cant say if it is effective on sunburns or not. I can only say it wasn't effective on what can best be described as a 'jalapeno pepper burn' on my hands. Next time I'll wear gloves when chopping peppers. Problem solved.
4,Helped me rebuild my 99 SRX...,"Pretty good and comprehensive. Good instructions on troubleshooting and assembly for the general family of SX/SRXs of that time period, and will give you a ggood amount of good information, but lack specifics to details on certain models. I wish they printed these in color because some of the pictures can be dark and, therefore, ambiguous. A good complement to this is the Yamaha Service manual-if you can get a hold of one. I was able to download one from a .pdf site, and this really helped out alot with things like wear tolerances and tuning."
5,Excellent!!,"Product is great, and works as listed. I have used it everyday since, light and easy to handle. Sorry but I am forced to write twenty words before I can leave a comment."
4,quality set with great attachments,I am very pleased with the manicure/pedicure set. The cord operated set is powerful with lots of power level options to adjust per function.
4,Nice size for daily use.,"My husband says that this is perfect to go to work for the day. This would not be big enough for a vacation. Does a good job keeping the insulin cool. I gave this 4 stars because we wish it would have had a shoulder strap, otherwise it's great."
5,Wonderful Case!,This is a great product. I recently took it on an overnite trip. I was very pleased. The case comes with two coolers which is a plus. One you use to transport your insulin and one you can chill for later use. It kept my insulin at the correct temperature during my traveling time and there is a place to store my needles as well. I am very happy with this product.
5,Great travel for medicine,"This is as another reviewer said, about the size of a shampoo bottle. But it keeps medicine cool and easy to use. Great for about 18 hours."
3,larger than it looks,"This Medicool insulin protector is much larger than it looks in the picture. It may insulate adequately, but we returned it, because it would not easily fit into my husband's diabetes tote bag."
2,Didn't kill any flies,"The box says it ""attracts and kills mosquitoes, flies and other flying insects"". I left it on for two days on a patio full of flies, and it didn't kill a single fly. Got a few gnats though."
3,bugg zapper,"When I first got this zapper, I liked it. It zapped bugs left and right. After a few days, there were tons of dead bugs on it....BUT! I noticed that there were 20 times more bugs on my front porch flying around then before i got the zapper....SO...even though the zapper works great...and fries the bugs dead, it seems the dead fried bugs attract a whole bunch of other bugs.I left it on for two weeks, then I turned it off. Most of the many bugs that were coming around dissappeared and went back to a few bugs here and there like it used to be.If you can find a way to make this zapper NOT attract a whole bunch more bugs, it would be great!I tried it again for a few days. Next thing I knew, I had tons of bugs again...and great big HUGE humongous moths. Turned it off and I have not more HUGE moths and only a few bugs again."
5,From a Redneck With the Proper Tool For Bug Eradication,"Jeff Foxworthy has made reference to people like me: I love to sit on the back porch in the dark watching the bug zapper while drinking beer. I've owned many zappers over the last 25 years or so. I've had some good ones (& some bad), but haven't had any better than this one. I like the vertical wire single-ring grid (it's easier to clean) as opposed to the dual-ring ""checkerboard"" grid. I just walked into the house to write this review from my backyard greenhouse (where the new unit was placed) where I witnessed total bug carnage while sitting there with a cold one. I like this zapper - I like it a lot."
4,So far so good,"I purchased the Flowtron BK-80D about a month ago. We have a little less than 3/4 of an acre of property that used to be a swamp, so you can imagine the amount of insects around our home. I put it on a light sensor so it turns on automatically when it gets dark. This thing gets really busy! I don't think it goes more than 10 seconds without killing something. I don't have the octonol in yet because I want to see how well it will do without it, but I definitely see a decrease in the amount of annoying insects around my house. It used to be so bad that we couldn't put our trash out at night without being attacked. Now we can. I'm debating on whether or not I should wait and see if it eventually becomes less effective to start using the octonol or if I should just put it in now to see if it increases the effectiveness even more. Right now I'm leaning toward putting it in about a week before having our next party in the backyard."
4,A good Bug Zapper,"This bug zapper works great. I have two dogs that were plagued by Biting flies. This zapper was the cure. I found it to be a much cleaner solution than the alternatives. The bug bags were too smelly and the chemical strips don't work very well. This is the right solution for flying pest problems. I only Gave it 4 stars because it needs electricity. So buy yourself one of those light bulb type, power adapters and youre all set."
2,No On-Off switch,"Get their more expensive model with light sensitive on/off switch. This model stays on all the time and the bulb is quite bright, not their black light. I would not recommend this one."
4,good zapper,"Got this to hang in my kitchen for flies and gnats all summer. Seems to work and looks good except....The short fat cord makes it hang crooked. I fixed it by zip tying a longer extension cord around two corners of the unit and swagging the cord like a lamp. Not perfect but acceptable and hangs straight now. It does buzz and hum. Not terribly loud, but noticeable. And finally, doesn't seem to attract those big black houseflies. Maybe ill try a regular fluorescent bulb instead of the blacklight bulb it came with. Overall, a good unit and I'd recommend it, but for said minor annoyances."
4,It's a winner,"We had this bug zapper before, but when it was old and ready to retire, we bought another brand. It was not good, so we went back to our old zapper and we will never buy another brand."
4,I will try again!,I used this product one day when the transformer failed. No zap. It had a moth stuck on it for 24 hours and it was still alive! The box included a flier that said to call the manufacturer first if something was wrong and they would take care of it faster and cheaper than the retailer. I talked to them (took several tries to get through) but nothing they suggested would be as efficient as dealing with Amazon directly. I had a replacement from Amazon in less than 36 hours from the time I requested it on-line! I have had the repacement for approximately one week and so far it is working fine. It does seem to kill a significant percentage of mosquitoes even without using the chemical. Previous bug zappers I have had killed everything but mosquitos. We do have a significant mosquito issue late in the afternoon which this does not help with. Right after dusk it goes into action.
3,Doesn't do what I'd hoped it would...,"I own 5 rural acres and have a nasty no see um / biting midge problem, no mosquitoes to really speak of, but lots and lots of no see ums, they literally fly into your mouth, nose, ears when your outside. They travel in large swarms and they rule my yard. I'd hoped this bug zapper would relieve me of the infestation, sadly it doesn't. They seem completely unaffected. I've used the bug zapper during the day, during the night, for long periods of time, nothing seems to matter, and so far, it's only ""zapped"" a few critters, nothing one would expect when living in such rural surroundings, and not even coming close to the results so many others seem to obtain. It may work very well for others and their pests, it simply doesn't work for me and mine."
4,Pleased with this first response...,"We just bought a place in Florida and were pestered by the mosquitos. No problem with this Flowtron from Amazon. It was shipped promptly and arrived a day before schedule. I put it up for just two days and it was crammed with the night air and what flies there. I am impressed that this light, without the insense sent with it, was so effective. I would advise starting with the 1/2 acre size unless you really have a large place that needs controlled. Otherwise, you are wasting energy and money...it is surprizingly effective.."
1,What a waste,"This was a total waste of time and money. I had high hopes, because I'm inundated by mosquitos. The thing worked for a very short time, and never attracted mosquitos. I bought the attractant and used it. One light is intermittant and the grid seems not to be electrified. A friend has had similar success. I just bought a bat house."
2,no go for mosquitos,I bought this to kill mosquitos. The only insects that I findare ants of which there are so many that the few that arekilled are totally meaningless. Save your money
1,"Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Insect Killer, 1/2 Acre Coverage","I live in Dallas,TX and this Flowtron is completely useless. I had previously another similar product from Stinger and it just doesn't work.I don't know if that type of products works with mosquitoes in other regions.But here it doesn't catch any mosquito, and the mosquitoes just continue to attack people very aggressively. They are ignoring the product completely!I find that a product from OFF (OFF clip-on) is much more effective, although a bit more inconvenient - you have to carry them."
5,must have for outdoor,"this is cool, meet my expectations, it does kinda noisy when it catches but u know it's doing its job, thanks!"
4,Good product.Not 100% effective for mosquitos but good!,"This is a good value and easy to install. (just put on mosquito strip and hang it up!)I did still get a mosquito bite when it was up. Just a couple, before use of the light,it would have been many bites. I am glad I purchased it. I found if I use some other skin protectant and the light, I am not bitten at all. Prior to this, the skin protectant was not good enough and I would get many bites. Provides an attractive light outside and you don't need other lights on. It is well worth the money even if just used one season. My dogs are also entertained by the bug zapping!We like to sit outside at night in the swing and it adds light and protection from all flying bugs. Now I can sit outside again! I have missed 2 summers avoiding the outdoors at night because I was bitten by mosquitos. Great purchase for me and my family."
5,Got mosquitos? Get the Flowtron!,I moved to the Jersey shore (the bayshore by Sandy Hook) and have been frustrated - denied the use of my back deck in the evening due to nasty NJ mosquitos. I went for it and installed the 80 watt Flowtron about 20 feet from my deck on a tree eight feet above the ground. We now enjoy our evenings bug-free; the Flowtron is so entertaining I'm thinking of canceling the cable TV...Seriously - take a pass on the junky stuff at the home centers - buy the real article.
5,Flowtron Electric Insect Killer,"We have not been able to find this type of bug zapper anywhere in our area. We use it to attrack insects to the area where we fish off our dock. It zaps the bugs which bring in the bait fish which then in course brings in the large fish. It also helps keep insects in that area and away from our house or front porch. We are so glad we could find this particular type, its the only kind that works."
4,Great product!,"I am very pleased with this product so far. We live in a very woody area that has large variety of flying insects, and the Flowtron has significantly decreased their numbers. It is now much more enjoyable to be outside."
1,Wouldn't hurt a fly,"Don't waste your money on this low powered unit. Not only did it not work because of a disconnected wire, ...I was able to repair, but it environmentally safe because it doesn't kill bugs. Step up two the dual tube #80 ...it is definitely worth the extra money."
1,Insect Attraction,"I purchased the Flowtron BK-80D Electronic Insect Killer to give as a gift to a senior citizen who lives out in the woods. The recipient found it to be beautiful, but had no idea that it wasn't working properly. The product attracted millions of insects, but never once ""zapped"" a bug. Laughing insects walked on the grid enjoying the view. I'm hoping the company will work with us to replace the useless unit with something that functions properly."
1,doesn't work,"very dissappointed. I purchased this item for my 10' by 20' deck for mosquitos. I thought I would spring on the one that covered more acre, even though this is a tiny area. It doesn;t keep the mosquitos away at all. It is now full of moths and I can't get them off the light. I read reviews and thought it would be the perfect solution for cookouts and drinks on the deck. Complete dissappointment."
3,Flowtron insect lamp,"This lamp does kill a lot of bugs, but I don't think it can make a 1/2 acre area entirely mosquito free."
1,Just Not Working,I moved my zapper in different locations (read and followed the directions) and I still had problems with mosquitos coming in my home! My patio also had flying bugs and we have a problem with West Nile Virus Encephalitis in our area. I decided to have my lanai screened in instead.
1,Flowtron BK-80D,"Save your money on this product!!! Mine worked for 2 weeks and stopped working. They sent me parts to fix it the first time, which did not correct the problem. It was then sent back to the factory which took them 3 weeks to return it. It work the same as when I sent it, meaning nothing was done.It was sent back to the manufacturer again and I requested a new unit or send me my money back. After having it for two more weeks, I called to find the status. They informed me that a new unit was going to be sent the next day. Not receiving the shipment after 8 more days, I called again and they said it was just shipped today and should arrive next week. Based on past permormance I have my doubts. Two weeks of operation and 2 1/2 months later, I still do not have a unit and mosquito season is over!!"
1,Garbage,"Don't wast money on this product. Doesn't work. I don't know if it works with mosquitoes, but definetely it does not work with flies. I have plenty of flies in the garage where I have installed it, and there are no flies attracted to the light to go there and die. Waste of my time and money."
1,It did not work,"When a bug was electrocuted, the zapper was not strong enough to pulverize the insect. They remained in the grid. I returned the unit."
4,new order and trial,Mosquitoes sneak in to my house and bite like mad. can this product be used indoors to get rid of these blood suckers? Maybe when everyone goes to work?
2,DC-area mosquitoes did not notice,"Maybe this works on some other kind of mosquito, but here in the DC area this had absolutely no effect at all!"
1,Waste of money,I bought this item 3 weeks ago and so far I am waiting for the first mosquito to be zapped !
5,Worth every penny!,I love this item. It's works great. Worth every penny! We are out on our patio ALL THE TIME!! We never get bitten. I recommend it to everyone I know.
1,"Kills bugs, but surrounding plants too!","This product is very effective for getting rid of bugs, but after using it for about 4 weeks I noticed that my plants that were about 6 feet away from it started wilting - almost as if they have been scorched under the sun ! For now I have turned this off, I have to find another spot to hang this lantern - away from my plants !On the positive side - I have very few bugs."
4,"Works Great, Feels/Looks Cheap Up Close","PRO -I bought it for moths, not mosquitoes, as I had quite the overwhelming population. It took a couple months, but this thing caught up to the population eventually, and it was such a relief to be able to go in and out at night without letting a moth in literally every time. The 1-acre coverage seems accurate for the model I bought.CON -Really big moths (and I mean REALLLY big, like tomato worm moths) don't fit inside, and thus don't get zapped.TIPS -Make sure you hang it reasonably far from anywhere you want to hang out or go in/out doors, as it brings the bugs to that area of the yard.It gets covered pretty quickly, but still seems to attract them in. Cleaning is pretty easy (I just shake it a bit, or tap on the outside), just don't be down wind when you do it!"
1,BK-40D Don't buy it,Light bulbs are only good for 6 months maximum. At $29+ each it left me very unhappy. I had a Sears zapper for 20 years and never replaced a bulb. Otherwise the zapper worked ok. I have two other smaller Flowtron zappers that work ok except that I had to replace a bulb in less than year in one of them. In my BK-40D when it was new I had left it on 24/7. After I replaced the bulb I just left it on at night. It didn't do any better.
2,Generally Ineffective,"I bought this product with great hopes (thanks to many positive reviews), alas, it does not make a noticable difference in my mosquito and other flying insect problem. I live in northern Virginia, in a relatively built up area and have a small yard, but a horrid biting insect issue. Despite getting rid of standing water pools, over 1 week with the mosquito repellent installed, the MK-15D has not made a worthwhile dent. Friend and family come over and, like me, still get horribly bit in our back yard. We placed the unit close to our patio, but away from other lights and no help. What a shame. It lights up, warms up, etc and kills a few bugs here and there. All in all, a waste of money. As such, I'd search out whatever other limited options you can find. I know I'm still looking."
3,It Scared the Dog so bad it wouldn't go outside anymore!,"We had to stop using this when we figured out that was why the dog wouldn't go outside in the back yard anymore. It is amazingly QUIET, which I was impressed with, and has an almost lavender light. But I can't say how it works. We think the dog's previous owner 5+ years ago might have had an electric fence? Our other dog seemed o.k. with it."
2,Broken,"It works fine now, but it arrived broken and it took a lot of time and super glue to put it back together so it would work!"
4,Bugs zapped,"I was hoping that since the product had been on sale since ~2000, and there were quite a few positive reviews, it would be a winner in solving our rural fly problem. I put one out front and one out back, and it worked. Very few flies remain to harass us. When we get bees checkin out the buds, we'll have to put them away (too effective - fear for the little bees). Good buy."
3,Effectiveness,Purchased it to get rid of pest flies. We planted a variety of dwarf fruit trees which apparently attract flies. The unit is less than 40 feet from the trees but does not effectively attract the flies. It is highly effective against other airborne insects.
1,Doesn't work and can't find out how to replace it.,It worked for 12 days and then nothing. Have not had the time to research on how to return it.
2,Flowtron Electric insect killer -for 1 acre,"I recently purchased the Flowtron insect killer for 1 acre, and it does not lessen the mosquito population in my yard at all! I get bit 20 ft away from it. I hear it zap a bug once in a while, but they are moths mostly. The mosquito attracting scent paper that I stuck on the bottom does not lure them away from us people! I want my money back! Kathy in Colorado"
2,electrical requirements / placement,"When the flowtron it arrived, the instructions indicated that the flowtron should be placed at a location away from the house; away from people. Since I did not have an electrical feed away my house, I had to return the flowtron. Having the instructions under product information would have been helpful.This rating IS NOT based on product usage.This rating is based on the product's description on the internet."
2,Zapper failed after 3 months,"This zapper only lasted about 3 months (worked great for 3 months) don't waste your money on this product, because you'll have to buy another zapper after it breaks down"
2,"D-E-A-D, dead!","Whoever said mosquitos aren't attracted to light!? They swarm this thing and pop like popcorn! It's 99 % mosquitos, too. I'm somebody who will stop to help a daddy longlegs out of the bathtub but when it comes to mosquitos, oh man, FRY! I cleaned it yesterday evening and last night it rained. The inner bars are caked with mosquitos and I'll have to clean it again today.I've only had it a week so I can't talk about longevity or the cost of replacement bulbs. It is constructed of cheapo plastic, the inflexible kind like they use on toy models. I can't believe how thin and cheap are the doors that hold in the bulbs that have to be removed each time it's cleaned.Some have written about cutting away bars to allow larger bugs in. I'm probably going get some kind of mesh to wrap around it to keep the larger bugs out- it allows in large, colorful moths- I just want those mosquitos!edit- would have been good, stopped working after a couple weeks."
4,BEST BUY FOR THE MONEY,"I bought this item a week ago, installed some 50 ft from my deck, and was amazed by the action. As soon as I plugged it in, it started zapping- MOSQUITOS-- I haven't even put the Octenol attractant in there yet. Make sure to buy the 40 watt version- -get a 7-8 ft shepherd's hook to mount on. At first I put it next to my deck- but then I actually read the directions and learned you want the mosquitos attracted AWAY from you- Duh!No propane, No chemicals, No $300Maybe buy a timer to turn on/off at certain times...Drawbacks-some people may be bothered by the zapping- you'll hear it !and maybe some beneficial bugs get zapped-Electricity- of course use a GFI outdoor outlet if possible, and outdoor rated electrical cord!JB-"
1,Didn't Last Long,"This product worked for about 2 weeks. While it worked it did what it was supposed to. After two weeks it would not turn on at all. I emailed Flowtron customer support. After 1 week they finally replied. They stated that they believed the transformer was inop and asked if I could replace it myself. They said they would ship the part to me. I replied back saying that I could replace the part, gave them my address, and attached my receipt for purchasing the product. That was on October 5th, 20 days ago. I have not received any other response nor have I received the part. It's 2010 wake up and get decent customer service. Another junk company."
2,Flies seem to ignore it,"The box says it works for flies, but in our yard flies seem to complete ignore it. It kills moths (hmm, moths are attracted to light, who knew?) But our issue is backyard flies (both tiny ones and middle-size) from god-knows-where and they seem to ignore this device, day or night."
5,Great bug light,"After purchasing 3 stingers from Wal Mart I read the reviews here and went with this flowtron. It certainly lived up to the billing on the reviews. I will be curious to see how it does next season, but the first season was great."
1,Not for Central TX mosquitos,Based on all the reviews of this product I recently bought this bug zapper. Earlier I had bought Stinger from HomeDepot. That did not work at all. So I returned the Stinger and bought this one instead.But it has not helped the situation. We live in Central TX and there are lot of mosquitos (especially from green belt).This zapper zaps a lot of stuff but not a whole lot of mosquitos. I am not impressed at all.
1,Insect killer failed,"This insect killer worked fine, that is, it attracted Mosquitos and killed them, bot only during the first evening of use. Apparently the electrical grid failed. As always, I was able to return it to amazon and received a full refund."
5,Die.....termites ....die,We live in sub-tropic weather up in the mountains so you can imagine the termite problems. I bought the first of these a few years back and it works very well in the evenings. I know this is meant to use outside but we have it in our home because of the termite problem. It's music to my ears when I hear them fry in the evenings.
1,"Kills moths, not flies","Did not work. Returned it. Only worked at night and killed moths. Bought it to kill flies. Sorry, but it did look good."
3,Works. Death to all mosquitos.,"Kills bugs, quite well. However, it is loud. Sometimes a large moth gets trapped, and it sounds like like a moth barbecue for about ten seconds.I dont know about the 1/2 acre, but it keeps the mosquitos away from my pond."
2,Don't bother to buy.,"This flowtron bk insect killer,doesn't work.I have small yard and still have mosquitos everywhere.Try something diferent,is waste your money.Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Insect Killer, 1/2 Acre Coverage"
2,"Still ""bugged""","After having read several favorable reviews about the Flowtron BK-40D I made the purchase. Too late did I find additional reviews citing the fact that mosquitos are not attracted to UV light alone. Even with the (costly) mosquito ""attractant"" installed, the unit was ineffective in drawing mosquitos to their destruction.To it's credit the Flowtron BK-40D is very successful in eliminating a variety of insects. Unfortunately mosquitos are not among them --- and that is the ""deal breaker"" for me."
2,didn't work,"I'm willing to admit that this may apply only to the one I received, but when the Flowtron arrived it was damaged (only one bulb lit up). Following the instructions in the box, I called the manufacturer, who was very helpful, called me back right away, and send out a replacement bulb for the one that was defective. Even after replacing the bulb, however, the unit didn't ""zap""--suggesting that there was an additional problem with the transformer powering the electric coil. At this point I shipped it back to amazon, who refunded my purchase and shipping costs. The woman at the manufacturer was surprised that amazon shipped the product in its flimsy shelf box and without further packaging, which may explain why it was defective when it arrived. Would try another one, but I'll find one locally in a store rather than having to deal with shipping back and forth if it's defective again."
2,Worked for two days.....,.....then went belly up. I tried the bulb in an old zapper and it worked fine so the bulb circuit in the unit is dead. Now I'm out $14.52 to ship (UPS) the darn thing cross country for repair. Hope they get it turned around quickly or I'll have to give it a one. Guess I'm disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. Wishing now that I bought it locally.
1,I got zapped on this zapper,"This product has an electric cord about as long as my index finger, and the mosquito repellent stick on the bottom packs you are suppose to stick on the bottom of these zappers will not stay there. They keep falling off. There needs to be a compartment or a small latch of some kind to hold these in place. For that matter they want $35.00 for a few of these things. The zapper itself only cost $49.00. Don't bother with this. Buy some bug spray! BK-40D Flowtron Electronic Bug Killer---NO"
1,Waste of money,Waste of money on this thing. I purchased this with high hopes. After receiving it I imediately hung it up about 6-8 feet high as recommended beside my deck. I have left it on 24-7 for 4 straight days/nights and it has yet to kill one bug. I don't know how you determine if it is defective or not. All I know is that is has been on (the light is on) continuesly for 4 days and not one bug killed. Very disapointed in this item.
1,Horribly Disappointing,"I purchased this unit based on the large number of people giving rave reviews. Sad to say, that I've owned this unit for 31 days (how convenient) and now neither bulb will light up. The first stopped working two days ago, and now both bulbs are non-functional. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing anything from Flowtron in the future. What a scam."
4,its ok,It does the job for me i have a small balcony but it gets clog and i don't really likes the fact that i have to change every month that chemical
5,Great EIK,"We purchased a cheaper $50 EIK from Lowes last year that has already broke. I'm hoping this one lasts longer. We've only had this for a few days, but it working great. Some of the EIKs don't attract the mosquitoes, but at least with the Mosquito attractant, a good portion of the dead insects were mosquitoes. The attractant was full of mosquitoes, so we went ahead and ordered the six pack (sold for $34 on Amazon)."
2,"10"" electrical cord?","Just received. The seller was fine and shipped promptly. The product has a ridiculous design. While the bug zapper seems to work fine, it only has an electrical cord that is 10"" long. Plugging in another extension cord will make an unsightly effect on the patio pergola. Plan to buy a good and matching extension cord if you don't want ugly!"
1,please listen to me,This product is useless. killed 3 flying insect (yup i counted) on the first day and that was that.just returned mine for a refund.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,why can not i excharge the item ..you can sent to me..why can not you accept that,i need a item which can be used inside..but it does not write in the web...oh my god. i want to change
1,Misleading,"If you are buying this product to reduce mosquitoes or other biting bugs, you will be disappointed to learn that all UV bug zappers are completely useless for this purpose. [...] In fact you are killing many ecologically friendly bugs that never bother human beings in the first place. Bug zappers are a gimmick for backyard entertainment only and are not a real tool for annoying insect reduction."
4,Back To The Flowtron Bug Killer,"I had been without a bug killer for a long time. The bugs was so darn bad this year I decided to buy a bag killer. I had one about like this one many years ago, so I thought the expensive new vacuum bug killers would be awesome. Not really. I had to return two bug killers. So I bought this one as I had had in the past. I hung it just off the deck and the next morning dead bugs was all over. This bug killer is the one that is awesome! I do want to also say I have had nothing but extremely great service with Amazon.com"
4,Flowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer (One Acre Coverage),This unit works great. The only reason I rated it a 4 star is because it does not have a dawn to dusk feature. I bought a separate dawn to dusk timer but I think it should have been included. After all the bugs I want to get rid of come out at night.
4,This thing is great,"The Flowtron arrived in good time and in good condition. I hooked it up and it started zapping bugs right away. (Of course my 16 year old son thinks this is great.) We live in the woods and the bugs we horrible this year, but after two weeks of use we have reclaimed our deck. This thing really works! It tends to get clogged up with bugs after about a week of use and then we just take an air compressor and blow out the dead bugs. (A shop vac reverse would do the same thing.) The only thing that stops me from giving a full 5 stars is the price of the misquote attractors refills. Why they are $35 for 6 of them or $11 for 1 is beyond me. The price is a little high but not what those propane thing-a-ma-jings cost. Overall I am very pleased. Otherwise I would not take the time to write this review."
4,"Well made, but the bugs like me better","I like the construction, and it appears clogging is not a problem at all. I just wish more mosquitoes liked the zapper. Here in Oregon it has been a fairly cool spring, but if I work outside at dusk I get bitten by two for every one that gets zapped.At the last house we had a Flowtron PV-75a, and that was downright funny. The blower must have been mounted backwards because it actually blew the bugs away. I saw it kill a few moths, but never a mosquito. Needless to say, this one is better than that.I do have some Octenol in there, but that doesn't seem to get mosquitos too excited. I'm hoping as the nights get hotter that things will improve. When it does zap one, it does so with great force. Also, I have it hanging under a second story deck and plan to get it out more in the open.I still would get it again, because I have yet to find anything else that works better."
3,It scares the dogs,"I bought this for out on the patio, where the dogs sleep, to try and kill the bugs but its so noisy when it's zapping the insects that the dogs are scared to stay up on the porch while its running. When a large insect gets in there it can make a loud zap for a long while.It has killed some mosquitoes so far but it's mostly moths and green lacewings that are being killed.It would be great if they could make this quieter."
3,worked fine-for a while,"I have 20ac in the northwoods of wisconsin. about mid may the misquotes got REALLY bad so I put up 2 of these they worked fine, and contrary to what people say they did kill thousands of bugs- my complaint is that after only 4 months one of them quit. Don't know if it is a bulb or what, but I am tired of china made sh-- that either doesn't work at all, or only works a couple of months before it breaks."
1,No effect on mosquitos,"Very disappointing. I have seen no effect on the mosquito population since I have been using this lamp. They are still everywhere, and seem to entirely ignore the lamp. Perhaps one or two have flown into it by accident, but the lamp certainly does not attract or kill them in meaningful numbers. Don't waste your money."
2,How did this get such great reviews????,"That's what I want to know. Does it zap bugs, well yes. However if you're buying this to reduce the bug population in your yard, that it will NOT do. I gave it two stars because it did kill things, but mosquitoes were not one of them. It also caused our red ant problem to get worst as they were getting a free lunch with the dead bugs falling from the trap. All in all it mostly kill ladybugs, moths, gnats, and flying ants. In the 3 days I had it set-up it may have kill 3 mosquitoes (that I could identify). That was with the scent lure attached. No flies or other biting bugs. Our backyard still belongs to them. It may help to know that I live in south Louisiana, and the humid conditions could have reduced this items' effectiveness."
1,Poor Customer Service,"After using this product for 6 months one of the light bulbs stopped working. I ordered a new light bulb but this did not solve the problem. I called and e-mailed customer service at Flowtron several times but I never got a response. Flowtron advertises a two year warranty, but they will not follow through on their warranty. Flowtron has poor product support and customer service."
5,Excellent at zapping bugs,"I live in an area of tons of flying insect of all sizes. Being in a rural area, and having some of the only lights on in the area, flying insects come in droves to my house at night. Since putting up this bug zapper, I have seen a noticable decrease in the amount of bugs flying around the outdoor lights, etc. It really works well!"
5,Best thing I have ever bought,This thing has killed 100's of thousands of mosquitoes and other insects in my neighborhood and has prevented me from getting bitten more than 1 or 2 times a night. Before I put this up I would walk from my front door to my car and get bitten at least 20 times and now that just doesn't happen. A very good investment and has withstood all the weather Utah can throw at it.
5,Worth every cent,"We bought this for use at our cabin in the Thompson Canyon area of British Columbia. What a great form of entertainment having that thing out and just sitting on the deck. Usually, we sit inside to avoid bites, but with this thing we sat unencumbered and enjoyed the evening outside. Works great."
2,"Works great, but breaks frequently","As long as it is working, the bugs zap constantly. However, I have had it a little over a year and have had to replace the bulbs, replace the starters (have to be shipped, under warranty, from the factory), and now the wiring has failed and I have to ship it back (at my cost) for them to repair under warranty. Not the best deal for the price. The reviews for it were great, which is why I bought it. However, over time these units do not hold up."
3,Maybe it works - not real sure,"We bought this Flowtron Insect Killer about 2 months ago when the Mosquitoes were raging in our area. It didn't cause an obvious reduction in the Mosquito population, but that might have been because they were so thick at the time. It kills bugs but it definitely doesn't rid the yard of most of the flying bugs like I had hoped for. But, I guess a dead Mosquito is one less that will breed and make many more. Don't buy it thinking it will keep your yard bug-free. It will help, but it won't get them all for sure."
5,Best bug killer of it's type - it really works,"This is my second unit. My first one I bought almost 20 years ago. It lasted a long time and finally gave up the ghost. This new model is very similar, with a few refinements in the bulb design and the cage.We set ours on a outdoor Christmas Tree timer. It comes on at dusk and turns off 4 hours later. On a warm night, you can hear bugs crackling every few seconds. It's a non-stop orchestra of bugs that will not be landing on me or my kids and taking blood samples.75 watts for 4 hours is a reasonable price to pay for this satisfaction."
5,Skeptical but it works!,"Purchased the Flowtron BK-40D and was a bit skeptical since reviews seemed mixed. Used it for the first time for the 4th of July and WOW, it worked great. At times the thing was more amusement watching than the fireworks. Clean up in the morning was easy, just took compressor and blew out the dead bugs. Not sure about the mosquito attractant cartridges work. It comes with one but didn't seem to work at all but once night came the light surely did attract the bugs. I wouldn't waste the money on these cartridges but it does come with one and you can try it out.But after the Flowtron BK-40D passed the test last night, think i'll be buying a second one!"
3,It works,"I really cant stand mosquitos which is why this was given to me. This was one of the better gifts I have received. Make sure you place it around 20 feet away from you since the zapper actually has scent to attract the bugs to it then it gives them a quick lightning death. Even after a month I still take satisfaction when I hear bugs getting fried!'...maybe its my built up anger from all those mosquitos thinking they could outsmart my citronella candles and feast on my skin or maybe I have a sick sense of humor, but it is funny. This zapper works pretty good and can be twisted entertainment! I got so annoyed by mosquitos blood sucking my legs when I wanted to enjoy a BBQ on my patio so I decided to make the purchase and get the half acre bug zapper."
4,Bug Lites,"The insect killers seem to work well. I replaced two Stingers; one was only about six months old and the other about a year and a half. These used to be good products, but now are unreliable.One of the Flowtrons came with minor damage, but the factory quickly sent a new part. So far I am satisfied, but time will tell if these are any better than the Stingers in the long run."
5,well worth the money i spent,"it paid for its self many times over and still is.we were infested when night time bugs as well as our neighbors,no one could sit out at night ,now every one near us is enjoying our zapper,and thanking us we got it.now there are 3 in our neighborehood,thanks flowtron for such a good product. bill woodard"
4,Vaporizes gnats instantly!,"This thing is nothing less than AMAZING!!! I've had several different and even more expensive zappers and they never worked like this one! Other reviewers said they had a pile of dead bugs below this thing and it is 100% TRUE! I'm not saying the yard is bug free... lets face it... nothing short of a nuclear explosion is going to make your yard completely bug free... so be realistic in your expectations. And, don't think this is ""overkill"" if you have a smaller area than the 1 1/2 acre coverage area stated. The lower models are designed differently and it lowers the efficiency. JUST GET THIS ONE!! You won't be sorry!"
1,Broke in Two Weeks,"The item works as far as killing mosquitos. I live next to a stream and there was a significant reduction in bugs around my home. However after two weeks the zapper stopped working, and since it is Amazon, it is such a pain to return things so I just ate $70.00.Skip it not worth the expense.Update: Amazon excahnged the item with no problem. The new Flowtron is now a month old and has reduced the mosquitos tremendously. Worth the gamble."
3,Works but missing an important feature,"This unit works well and appears superior in bug attraction and killing than the Stinger. However, it lacks a VERY important feature, it has no day/night sensor to turn it on at night. If it is plugged in, its on. So you have to plug it in manually every night or buy a sensor switch yourself. This is a big issue because the bulb will wear out quickly if you let it run 24/7 and an outdoor rated plug-in switch is not cheap. They could have one built into the unit like the Stinger models for less than a dollar. Look into how you plan to operate the unit before purchasing the Flowtron."
1,Stopped Working After 1 Year,"Did a pretty good job while it worked, but almost exactly one year after putting it up, the unit failed."
3,Flowtron Zapper,While it kills mosquitoes very well I was hoping it would have the same effect on stink bugs-------------Don't buy it for that purpose.Kenny
2,doesn't kill many mosquitoes,"I bought this a couple months ago because of the good reviews it had on Amazon. However I haven't had any luck with it. At night time I see moths and stuff swarming around it and occasionally getting fried, but I haven't noticed any mosquitoes getting zapped. I know they are out there though because I get bit after about 3 minutes outside without bug spray on. Maybe this product works for other localities of mosquitoes, but I live in Houston and it doesn't attract the type of mosquitoes that we have here."
2,Made a dent,"After reading all of the great reviews this product received, I decided to purchase this unit. It hardly made a dent in our mosquito population. I removed all standing water and purchased the attractant along with it (if you do not use attractant it will not kill mosquitoes). I have owned the unit for 6 or 8 weeks now and we still have tons of mosquitoes to put up with. If I had the option to do it over...I would buy a different product.side note: the attractant uses two-way tape to stick on the bottom of the unit. If you live in a warm area, the attractant has a tough time sticking to the bottom and just falls to the ground!!"
4,Mosquitoes beware!,"We had a similar ""bug zapper"" years ago. The old one quit working after many summers of use so when we found this one, thought we would give it a try. We hadn't been able to find one in the stores. It hangs out by the shed and snaps and crackles every night of the summer months. We actually have to close our bedroom window because it works so hard. We live in North Dakota and our main objective is to get rid of those pesky and virus-carrying mosquitoes. Of course it can't get them all, but the mosquito population has been reduced significantly. One problem is getting the ""fried"" bugs cleaned off the unit so it works with 100% proficiency. You can't bang it or shake it so we use a low pressure air hose to gently blow the bugs out - which is kind of a pain. The birds gather around the ground under the zapper and have a feast of barbequed bugs every morning! Overall it does what it's supposed to do so both the birds and the humans are happy."
5,Bug Slayer,"Good stuff!This unit will really lower the amount of annoying bugs you'll have in your area-- The Mosquito attractant seems to work okay, but you'll likely still need to go for some type of redundancy in your actual sanctuary if mosquitos are your primary target. When nobody is outside I imagine the Flowtron looks pretty good to a Mosquito, but when you're outside with the unit I think they still opt for the tastier less deadly humans.Overall a great product and American made to boot!"
5,bug be gone,"i am verry happy with my flowtron BK15D elect insect killer 1/2 acre coverage, it is unbelivable how many bugs it kills in one night. easy to clean and install the sent packs. i will enjoy this unit for many years thank you. pete j."
3,Bug Zapper,"The description of it is not complete. First the item cannot be installed on a building! Second, the electric power cord is short and therefore must be used directly where there's power away from the house or with an extension cord."
4,Great item but seller is NOT ACCEPTABLE!,"I have the 1 1/2 acre Flowtron and we love it, works great. I bought my mother the 1/2 acre one on June 26th and it was supposed to arrive no later than July 9th. They didn't even ship it until July 12! I never heard back from the email I sent asking about this either. I can't believe it took them 17 days just to get it in the mail. All I can say is the product is great but I am NOT HAPPY WITH THE SELLER AND WOULD NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN."
2,Waste of Money,"While it does kill mosquitos, it barely makes a dent in the mosquito population - I still get swarmed when I go outside. I following the directions exactly and tried different locations. The bottom line is the mosquitos are still so thick, it doesn't matter that the Flowtron killed a lot."
3,Insect zapper,I recently purchased an electric Flowtron insect zapper and I give the effectiveness of this product a three because I still received bits while sitting on my porch with the bug zapper on only five or six feet away from me. Thank you
1,Arrives Broken. No Refund.,"I just opened the Bug Zapper and one side was broken in the Box. It is completely non-functioning. I ordered it in July and waited until our mosquito time in August to open it and missed the return date by 3 days. I have no way to contact them with a complaint, so I simply have to take the loss. PLEASE if you order this frail, shoddy item check the contents immediately!!!!"
1,Noisy and Smelly,"This trap is very annoying. Unless you like the sound of sizzling bugs or the smell of burning insects, I'd try a different type of solution. I recently trashed my old-school zapper and bought a Nile 2000 mosquito trap that uses UV light, CO2, and heat to attract mosquitoes and then silently suck them down into a catch basin with a small fan. The bugs just dry out and die in the basin since they can't get out. I had to empty my catch basin 3 times in the first week and caught thousands of mosquitoes. My Nile 2000 trap has made a huge difference in my yard and I can actually sit on my patio without the sound and smell of burning bugs."
2,cheap plastic,"Fist of all, they could add about 4 more foot on the AC cord, Never see anyone only have a 1 1/2 cord.Looks very cheaply made. Only 2 little screws to hold all the weight of this unit. The hanging ring is not solid, Had to weld the ring together so it won't let go in a strong wind.Could of use a On/Off switch on it too."
4,Smokin bugs!,"This thing really fries them! I can't really tell how many mosquitoes fly into it, but it sure stays busy all night long!"
4,Zaps on demand!,Bought this product to reduce the flying critters near our home in the Northeast summertime. It has reduced the number and frequency of flying bugs near the deck. It came with all advertised hardware and simple instructions. I bought the accompanying mosquito attractant and bracket. The whole package was just under $100.00. A fair price is the zapper keeps zapping for a few more years. I have had no problems so far and it seems to be doing the job well the nights that it is on.
4,Kills bugs dead!,"I have only had the product for a week. I only gave 4 stars because I am unable at this point to determine if the product will last.However, the thing really works. We had an infestation of those lawn leaf hoppers. I have killed thousands of bugs in just a few days. I actually now have an ant problem because they are coming to get the bug carcasses and drag them away. I am planning to buy a 2nd one to put on the other side of my house."
3,Is this item shipped-New?,"Disappointed that within a weeks time after I put it up, the bulb malfunctioned. The bulb only was lit 1/2. Would like to return the bulb for a new one but no way of knowing how to do that."
3,It is OK but not very impressive,"I does make flies go away but it doesnot attract them well ,so you still see some flying around.They need to improve that ."
4,works good,"works good, easy install I have had good luck with the items I have purchased here and usually fast ship."
1,Piece of crap,It only worked for a couple of hours (however seemed to work for mentioned short time).Shipped it to the Caribbean; warranty is something I can forget.
5,"So far, so good","Used it in my backyard, which usually has quite a few mosquitoes. This cut the mosquitoes down quite a bit."
1,doesn't kill flies,I brought this product for my greenhouse (25 feet) and the product doesn't work. Stilled have flies flying around in the greenhouse.
5,Very pleased with Flowtron BK-80D Electronic Insect Killer,"After purchasing two ""Stinger"" 40 and 80 models from Lowe's and Walmart....and returning them(the wires were too far apart to kill mosquitos), welooked extensively online. We read so many favorable reviews about the Flowtron BK that I searched the Houston Tx area but could find none. Found the 80D at Amazon.com for $10.off, tax free, and free freight. The rest is history. We love that zapping sound that reassures us the unit is working. We NEVER heard 1 zap from the ""Stinger"". I think those units must just kill large bugs. We have the swamp mosquites and live with a bayou at the bottom of our property....two acres."
2,No help with mosquitoes!,"Unlike the previous reviewer, we have not found the Flowtron to be helpful with our mosquito problem at all. Seems like it keeps some other kinds of bugs -- moths, flies, gnats -- at bay, but we are still getting bitten terribly even after using the device for a couple of weeks (with the mosquito ""bait""). We're going to try changing locations, etc., but so far it's a real disappointment."
4,Does the job,"I have a mulberry tree next to my driveway and for six miserable weeks each summer, I have berries dropping all over the place. Of course, the flies eventually show up to feast on them. This year was particularly bad, and we even had a horde of moths show up. It got so bad that when we would drive up at night, we had to drive through a cloud of insects, which is when I decided to buy this Flowtron product. I have had similar products before and they all seem to work pretty much the same. I mounted this one about four feet high near the driveway and turned it on. It instantly attracted the moths and within a day or two, they were no longer a problem. The flies were a bit harder to get rid of, because they hatch new flies every week or so. But this product thinned out their numbers to an acceptable level until the berries stopped falling. Next year I will put this in place early and hope to prevent the insect explosion that I experienced this year."
5,very good product,THIS PRODUCT THAT I PURCHASED IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT IT WORKS JUST LIKE IT SAID IT WOULD WORK I AM GOING TO PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE VERY SOON FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN'T BEAT IT .
5,It's a killer!,"Bought one a week ago, took it out of the box applied the smell pack and pluggeder in...zap,zap,zap... We put it in the back yard about 20 ft. from the patio - back door and it has helped a lot w/being able to BQ and open the door without letting all the flying headaches in.Went to Wal-mart today and bought the $29.95 Black & Decker model. If it does work then the moths must like the charge, their just sitting on the screen. Will be returning it tomorrow...mean while I'm ordering another one of the 80D-Flowtron for the front of the house. I should charge the neighbors a area free bug tax:-)"
1,Will NOT kill mosquitos,"I was trying to find a cheaper way to kill mosquitos than using a CO2 device. I was reading about the science behind these types of insect killers (UV plus octonel), and the articles I read said that they would work well to kill other insects, but not mosquitos. This has exactly been the case with mine. It will kill a lot of flying insects, but won't touch mosquitos. I've tried suspending it right above water, put it at different heights and locations in the yard, and mosquitos won't go near it. I put a sheet under this thing to see what it will kill and it will kill plenty of flying critters, but not mosquitos. The problem is the other flying insects don't bother me and some of them may actually kill mosquitos as well. Overall this product has been a complete failure with regard to the reason I bought it."
2,not for tropical mosquitos,"i would like to believe all the good reviews about the bk40d, but it makes me wonder whether the mosquitos here in suriname, south america, are different from those in the states.i even ordered a second one along with replacement bulbs directly from the manufacturer, to try to protect my family from mosquitos on a patio of aprox 180 sq.metres. i am really disappointed because the manufacturer did not specify the climate zones, in which this device is to be used.yes, i need to say that there is an occasional, popping sound, so some mosquitos get attracted but i am absolutely still bitten a lot by mosquitosSo this device is absolutely useless for meThe two stars are for the way it is designed, it looks sturdy and above all safe for small children and pets. It is easy to install. it's just a pity that is doesn't work"
4,Minimize the pesty mosquitos,"I bought this two weeks before my backyard bbq and it was a great help. Before I had it, as soon as I stepped outside, mosquitos would start biting me if I had no repelant. But within a week the Flowtron had minimize the pests. I had about 50-60 people at my bbq and no one complained of getting a mosquito bite. Unfortunately it kills all bugs,so I have no more lightening bug flying around. I liked those bugs. But to good, sometimes have to suffer for the bad."
4,Rid of Mosquitos,"This product works good. It hasn't gotten rid of all the little devils, but the number is reduced. I have such an allergic reaction to mosquito bites that I have more of a problem than everyone else. I personally still need spray (which I hate) but no one else seems to need it."
4,Lives up to the reviews!,"This Flowtron device comes fully asembled and ready to start killing bugs, which it did immediately upon install, Very pleased with it. I actually like sitting back and watching/listening to the ""zapping"" as weird as that might sound.Does exactly what it claims, which very few products do!"
5,bug zapper,"Great Item. I bought 3 for my 5 acres, put 2 around deck and swimming pool,approx 3 acres and had no problems with pests,also 1 by horse barn made a big difference. Just put it 20ft away from where you want to enjoy yourself,and you can, pest free.Worth every penny spent.In the long run it's cheaper than all the off,and horse spray."
5,A1 Official Electric Bug Killer Works Just Like It Should,"Put those pesky varments out of their misery just like we used to when I was growing up the old fashioned way. Zap em. This is a great bug zapper for a 9,000 sq. ft. or less yard. It is also very tuff and durable. I have really put it to the test since I've had it. Believe me this is a very reliable product. I do not recommend turning your sprinklers on aimed at it with it plugged in on the ground though. Although it did survive I highly do not recommend this stupid action."
4,Good and bad,"Flowtron zappers work well for me. My other option is a Stinger and those are not self-cleaning. I use the zapper to draw the bugs away from the house door. If it reduces the mosquito population, it still leaves a gazillion. Leave it on all the time. First unit went for 6 years and two bad hurricanes. Second unit only twelve months. This is my third Flowtron. Hope that the reduced mercury levels in the bulbs isnt the cause of the short life. Been using Flowtrons and Stingers for over twenty years. Last Stinger didnt last a year either.My best defense against mosquito bites was taking my wife along as bait. She is a real mosquito magnet! Tried to wrap her in electrified zapper mesh. Now she is my ex-wife."
2,Not that good,"The wires are pretty far apart and it only seems to kill larger insects, not the mosquitoes I was hoping it would."
1,never so disappointed,"After reading the glowing reviews on the Flowtron Insect Killer I was so sure it would work that I threw away the box and plugged it in. It worked for three days and died. When I say it worked, I mean it lit up and made a humming sound but it never killed even one insect, fly or bug. Never so disappointed."
1,short lived,Plugged it in and it worked great for about 4 weeks. Then it died after about a month of use. Won't even turn on.
4,"Stll got mosquito , but seems better","worked, and got a lot of bug zapped, the grid is none stick, no maintainence needed.left it in the backyard one night, the rain followed, it is still working well.Still got mosquito bite, but seems less bug bother us."
4,It Works ! ! !,"I had been on the web looking for a ""bug Zapper"". The big box stores only carried 1 or 2 brands and the reviews were terrible. So I thought I would go to Amazon.com and I found this product. I read all the reviews and they were Great ! Everything about it sounded so good, that I decided to purchase one. I am most amazed at the performance of this product. You can hear it working all night long. It is well built and seems very sturdy. I only gave it 4 stars as I have had it up only a few weeks. I am sure it will perform year after year. A good product."
4,Flowtron bug killet,"Excellent product, unfortunatelly the lamp just fits the box, so the plastic part that holds the lamp arrived broken."
4,"Perfect, does what youd expect.","I bought this bug zapper for a father's day gift this year, and this was the perfect gift to give anyone. Kills bugs and also quite amuzing to have in your back yard."
3,So far so good,"This item is in our garage at the moment. Late in the mosquito season, still i hear it fry bugs every once in a while. I can see their dead carcasses in tbe unit."
4,"It's good, but could be better.","I bought one to try it out in the South America. I put this unit up in the camp in the jungle. It's fun to watch this thing work. Kills everything that can get inside of it.The problem, nothing big can get inside. Will have to cut the frame like someone here suggested. That's why 4 stars."
4,Pleased with the Flowtron,"Shipping was quick. The Flowtron took a few days before we really noticed a difference. Not all bugs are zapped but we are in Florida, the home of all bugs and even though we are in a subdivision we got the one for an acre because the mosquitos are particularly thick this year. We are able to be more comfortable outside since we aren't being chased back in by mosquitos, deer flies etc. We would buy it again."
1,Short life,"We got our Flowtron about two years ago and its already dead.It was good while it lasted but compared to the 20 something year old bug zapper we had before it, a two year life span was extremely dissapointing."
2,No long term reliability,"I used this for three months in 2011. Caught lots of bugs, but I felt no change in the number of biting mosquitos in my yard. After leaving it in storage over the winter, plugged it in this past month. Lights came on, but didn't catch a single bug. I checked the voltage on the grids and it was 0. This is a poor product and the only reason it didn't get 1 star is because it caught lots of bugs that first year."
3,Disappointed,I've purchased one despite of some reviews about starter faulty. Mine has worked for only one night. On next night it didn't work. I've disassembled the top cover and found the starter starter was burnt smoke. I've taken out the starter and touched two wires together for one moment and light was on. Now I'm using the Flowtron by that way until I have a new starter.
4,It's zapping away!!!,I got this zapper for the increase of flying insects that looks like red ants with wings. (I love it!) It's zapping away! I placed this item a little away from the house and next to a tree (where I know they are hanging out).Get this if you have moth and flying ant problems!
4,Flowtron zapper works best in the dark,"I got these to give to a friend who lives near Big Lake, Alaska. He gave one of them back, since they don't seem to be very impressive when it is light all night long. He is thinking that by having them earlier in the year next year, they will be more help when the mosquitos first appear."
2,No good..,"Stopped working the second time I plugged it in... It's got a short in the wiring somewhere.. Missed the return window by a week because I didn't get it hung up for 2 weeks after I got it.. 1st time I used it, it worked great, 2nd time I went to use it, it had stopped working... Nothing is built to last anymore... It's junk..."
5,Great product,I shopped around for many days before I decided to buy. Checked locally and the prices were way to much. As stated before it does kill a lot of unnecessary bugs. I was targeting mosquito's. My family couldn't even go outside. We still get bites here and there but it's way better. I've had no problems at all. Would recommend this to anyone.After using for several months I can attest to the performance of the zapper. It works! We could go outside and enjoy our backyard. No more being held hostage.
4,bug zapper does the job,"nice light weight unit, easty to hang...needs a longer cord and needs a bottom shelf to catch bugs...i ducked taped bottom so they wouldn't fall on floor in garage..."
2,Doesn't work very well,It killed quite a lot of harmless bugs but not many biting mosquitoes. I was quite disappointed. Do some reading about the effectiveness of the technology and stay away.
4,A zapper of excellence,Works very well. Worth paying the extra over the less powerful versions. Really attracts the insects. Thoroughly recommended.
3,flowtron bk-15d bug zapper,worked as described but not on the insects i really needed to kill. mosquitos. worked well with moths and flying beetles.
4,"Very good after dark, dusk, not so much","After dark, I absolutely love this product. The very first day we used it, I noticed that we could actually be outside by the pool and not get eaten alive.During dusk is a different story. Whenever the sun is up, this product does not attract the mosquitoes. I don't know if the octenol just isn't working, if it's just my area, or what. If you live in Florida and the sun is currently up until 8:30 pm, then this is a big deal. My wife likes to sit on the porch swing between 6:30 and 7:30. The Flowtron will not get the bugs at this time of the day. Around 8:15 as it gets darker, the bug machine gets very active and they leave us alone.If you live in another part of the country where the sun goes down sooner, this will not be an issue for those of you wanting to use it after work. After dark, it's great."
3,Disappointed,"The bulbs quit working last week. Just in time for the 30-day deadline to return it. Too late! I purchased a Flowtron 4 years ago and the bulbs lasted 3 years. I will never purchase a product like this via Internet. Easier to return it to a local store. Now have to purchase the bulbs separately, which are costly. I will say that had the bulbs continued to work, it's a great bug zapper!"
1,Doesn't work,Plugged it in and iit doesn't work?wish had just bought one from a retail store at least return wouldn't have been painful.
1,Did not work!,Received this product with a bad starter. I ordered a new bulb at first but it still did not work. I had to order a new starter and that fixed the problem. Good product but not worth the hassle.
2,Company doesn't stand behind their products.,I was excited to receive the Flowtron since we've had problems of moths and other insects getting into our home at night. Purchased a special cord to install the insect killer finally was ready to set it up. Plug it in an nothing it never came on. Tried direct plug in still nothing. Called the company they said to box it back up and to put a certain number on the box UPS would be picking it up. Which they did but I still don't have my Flowtron back.
4,So Far So Bueno!,Have had this for tooth days......so far so bueno! It killing the bugs and zapping them goodhaaa!!! Me love it so far....
1,Never again,"Bought this in June 2010- uses only a few times. Of course it worked when we used it. Just hung it this year (April 2011)- it was stored in original box for the winter indoors. Yesterday the top pf the unit detached from the zapper causing it to crash onto the patio. The flowtron company will not pay to return it. I am throwing it out and buying another brand. It was great for the couple of months in 2010 that it did work. My husband and I noticed that on either side of the top of the unit- where the screws are, that there was a crack on both sides...hmmm, manufacture defect? Yet they want ME to pay the return shipping! Dont think so! This is in no way a reflection on the seller from amazon- just the flowtron company itself."
2,disappointed,"I live in FL and have a mosquito problem. I bought this after reading all the positive reviews for mosquito control. I knew better, all studies show this technology is not really effective for biting insects... I tried over several nights leaving the units on for several hours around dusk. It killed a lot of insects, but only a handful of mosquitoes.Now I need to buy what I should have in the first place, a mosquito magnet or mosquito deleto."
3,Not Black Lights,"The Flowtron BK 80D I received was npt NOT Black Lighted, which works much better...They were very nice to deal with, fast shipping, etc."
5,Made in USA!,"It was great to see ""Proudly Made in the USA"" on the boxes (I ordered 3, for the front & back of the house and the garage).I put one in the garage last night and this morning saw that all the insects that could have potentially flown into the house when we opened the door were toasted to perfection.USA! USA! USA!"
4,I believe it works.,"I reviewed many other products before selecting this one. I put it in the back of my yard and it just works. I wish it wasn't soo loud when it zaps the bugs or a bug gets stuck in it, but I guess that's part of the program.I usually end up turning it on and setting up a bunch of torch lamps and other items, so combined it works. Have had it for two seasons and haven't changed the bulb. Hopefully replacing the bulb won't be an issue."
4,Makes Backyard Child Friendly,"This product does a wonderful job at decreasing the number of bugs in my yard. Before we got this we could not go outside without being surrounded by bugs. But now my toddler can play outside without having to worry. However, the plastic grate around the outside is a little small for some of the bigger bugs."
5,"Second one, may buy yet another!","My husband and I love these things! We now have 2, placed on either side of the house, such that they catch bugs from either direction before reaching us on the porch. Although we can simply relocate them if needed, we still may purchase a few more - one to put back by the garage, and one by the back door. I don't care for the octenol packs however, as I can smell them and they seem to choke me up a bit (they don't affect my husband). However the light works so well, I'm not sure they are needed."
3,A bit disappointed,"I bought this version after reading several reviews in the spring, because we had the Stinger Ultra big zapper last year and it died within months of working well for us. Nothing helped it. I wish I would have read more reviews on this one I guess. Maybe we have it too close (we have a fairly small yard, so 30 ft away from the house is best we can do), but I don't hear it zapping things all that often either. Perhaps expecting something that costs less than $100 to work on mosquitos is expecting too much, but I am disappointed in my 2nd try with this model. Hope to find a better alternative for next spring! These skeeters are horrible this year in the midwest!"
5,Electronic Insect Killer,Very satisfied with the electronic insect killer. It was also received in a short amount of time.
1,Not for houseflies,"This should not be called an insect killer. Maybe its a mosquito-ONLY killer. I don't know. I don't have many mosquitoes. What I do have are flies. I hung this machine about 2 inches over a fly ridden trash...I mean like around 50-100 flies and none of them got zapped. They would land on the outside and the rims, but I think the Flowtron made to much of a vibration and noise for them to want to land. I'm not a fly. I don't know why they won't land. This thing simply does not kill flies. A TOTAL AND UTTER WASTE OF MY HARD BORROWED MONEY."
2,Not sure it works,"We bought this because of good reviews and one bad one. Someone claimed the openings were not large enough to get big moths - for us that was a plus as we only wanted to zap mosquitoes. Well, it does kill small moths and maybe mosquitoes. I don't see any mosquitoes stuck to the electrodes. Nor after about 4 weeks have we noticed a decline in our mosquito population. Area is not the issue as our back yard is far smaller than the area this device is advertised to cover. In fact, several of our neighbors should be mosquito free also - since they are never outside, they wouldn't know. Nor do we have a pond or standing water. Just a small garden beyond or mini deck. As much as we hate chemicals, we have the deet spray handy for sitting on the deck."
1,Beware that a return is not an option for this item.,"We've just received the Flowtron 40D and without taking it out of the box have decided that it will not work for us. Normally returns on Amazon are easy but this product is apparently considered ""hazardous and dangerous"" and therefore not returnable to Amazon. Buyer beware: Be certain that you want this product and have not doubts about keeping it.The one star is for Amazon not making it absolutely clear that it's not a product that can be returned.Mine is still in the original box and packaging so I cannot rate the product itself."
1,Not a happy camper,"It did NOT appear to help with my fly situation at all. I took it to my son's, and it did great with mosquitoes and moths in the evenings."
1,nice outdoor light,"I've been using this product for about two weeks.(daytime & nights) It has not killed a bug yet!! I even placed a ground cover under the light to see if it was killing bugs, and I just wasn't seeing any of their corpses. Nothing! Not a one.... I followed the instructions to the letter. Big waste of money! My friend has the same unit, and his works just fine. But, he didn't get his from amazon..... You do the math.P.S. It does provide nice outdoor lighting so you can see the bugs before they bite you"
4,Took care of the mosquitoes,"Decided to purchase the larger version for my backyard, even though it's much smaller than 1.5 acres. We don't have a big mosquito problem, but the few that we had were annoying. They were all gone within a few days of plugging this thing in. I keep it on at all hours, but I plan to put it on a timer so that it's on only from late afternoon until morning. I just wish yellowjackets were attracted to the light!"
2,Think twice,"Unit worked for 2 hours , then the bas clogged and works o nly fair. cleaning did not help as bug debris stuck to metal doesnt remove well.Maybe with daily washing with soap would make it useful, but why is that necessaery?Not again."
3,Auntie Nell,"Did not open the box yet, but this is a replacement of the same model. I loved the old one. It died due to over use."
1,Do not buy this!,"Bug zappers kill many beneficial insects, but do not kill mosquitoes. They are not attracted to light. Insects are a necessary part of the food chain. They pollinate our food crops and wildflowers. An insect free world, as some of you seem to want, would mean no songbirds, also. How depressing that would be."
1,don't get it!,i hate it. really hate it i got it all happy that i'll get rid of flying anoying bugs but when i got it out of its box i found out that there was no cable just a plug. so in theary if you get this you are going to plug it directly into the sky? very messed up. never used it becouse if it. was a waist of money unless i get an extention cord and well its sitting on the table for a month becouse i didn't expect the need for an extention cord when the plug is less then a foot away.
1,Please don't buy this,"This device is advertised as a killer of light attracted insects. MOSQUITOES ARE NOT ATTRACTED TO LIGHT. DEER FLIES ARE NOT ATTRACTED TO LIGHT.These devices have been shown to significantly reduce populations of beneficial pollinating insects. You can find a summary of the research inScience News Online, april 22, 2000If you want to buy something that works, get one of the CO2 generating devices."
4,Nice buy,"I knew this product - my friend having same one, only on 1/4 acre. Tip for buyers: no matter how strong it is, must be two of them to make them work - to create some type of mosquito - free zone."
5,i love this,i got this to cut down the moth population.it works.i planted about 1 acre of corn and this helps cut down on other bugs as well.
4,Kills moths great,"I bought this item because we were infiltrated with a large number of mosquitos and needed to do something, since the city wasn't. It worked, but it became clogged up with more moths than mosquitos. We feel it has helped along with several other things we did to keep them out of the house and yard.Cleaning is difficult, because there's no way to easily dissassemble it enough to clean the elements."
3,"A good bug zapper, but attracted a lot of moths","SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes. The mosquito attractant did a good job, but didn't last that long, and was expensive to replace. The pesky ""flies"" go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it. Otherwise it would just attract ""non pesky"" bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away, so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside, and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy, but that is how I feel :)"
2,Flowtron Insect Killer,"Poor product. It will kill insects after it is really dark outside but it's totally ineffective in the daytime. I owned one (another brand) in the 70's that was excellent. The difference in the two was that my other one had one black light and one flourescent light. It was a softer light that seemed to attract more bugs, both in the daytime and at night. This is definitely an item to buy in a store so you can easily return it. Even the bait didn't help. I live in a subdivision that sprays for mosquitoes so we don't have many. The money would have been better spent on citronella candles. Makes a great night light though! It lights up my entire den through the windows. No more stumbling through the dark to get to the kitchen!"
5,SIZZLE SKEETERS!!! SIZZLE!!!,I love to sit on the front porch and listen to this thing fry me up some skeeters! I starts with a low steady HUMMMMMMMMMMMMM... and then... ZAP!!! This is really a great product and it has rid my front yard of a TON of flying pests. I can play ball in the front yard again with my daughter. YAY!
5,very happy with it,"after having issues with bulbs short life in a competitor product a few years ago I was hoping that would not be issue with this one.I am very Happy to announce that there have been no issues with this Flowtron unit and I will not hesitate to recommend it over the other unit, replacing the tube in the other brand(see my other review) will more the make up the price difference in short order."
5,Flowtron insect killer,"This bug killer is lightweight for easy installation, but it's very effectivekeeping down the mosquitoes at our rural home. Positionedseveral feet away from our entryway, it draws insectsto itself instead of them whooshing in the doorwhen we do. Fitted with the dawn to dusk attachment, it providesan outdoor light when we arrive home after dark. Very pleased withit and just ordered another for the barn."
5,"Durable, effective on mosquitos, USA made","I have used these for a few years. They are the same ones sold under the Sears label. Experiment with the height from the ground for different types of bugs. For mosquitos, place no more than six feet from the ground. Place in a shallow tray of water and watch the kill rate! Do not immerse any part of bulb or grid in water (rain won't harm it)."
1,Regular flies ignore this device,"House flies like the ones currently plaguing Boise this summer are not attracted to this device one bit. While my porch was consistently being invaded by an army of a few dozen small black house flies, this device could not convince a single one of them to enter its electric cage of destruction. Perhaps the attractant in it is not suitable for house flies, but if that is so the product should clearly state that in its description. The UV light itself also doesn't appear to do any good. I caught a couple of moths later at night, but those guys fly into anything remotely luminescent, so no points for that.For indoors, I had a similar experience withFly Web Fly Trap, which also didn't catch a single one of these flies. Summer is coming to an end, so nature will take care of the flies soon enough, but if you live in or around Boise and think either of these products can help you rid of the flies, think again."
1,Already Broke!,"It seemed to be doing the job. Then after less than a year, it just quit working. I bought a new bulb to no avail. Now I'm stuck with a new bulb and left-over mosquito attractant! Bummer!"
4,Works great... now.,"We are on two wooded acres in Central Texas. I hung this outside about 80' from the back patio and had a fun time watching the bugs zip and zap for many months. Then the music ended. I emailed their support folks (3 year warranty!) and they said the main coil from China was faulty and they were experiencing many failures. They notified me when the good parts were available, they repaired it, and I'm once again listening to the joyful sounds of dead bugs. I recommend this zapper but you may want to call their QA people and ask them if the faulty coil problem has been resolved before ordering."
5,It should be called the mosquito assassin!!!!!,"I wish I could attach photos to the review, after our 4th of july barbecue i looked on the ground below the zapper and would never bother to try and count them, there were THOUSANDS of dead bugs under the zapper! I have had this unit over a year, never put an attractant pad in it and have raved about it to everyone that asks about it!IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS, LET ME HELP YOU: * * * * * * * B U Y I T !!!!!!!! * * * * * * * * * *This zapper could cost twice as much and still be worth every penny!!!!!"
4,Kills the mosquitos!!!!,"I have a Stinger that works fine, but like other reviews have stated, i have to clean the bugs out of the Stinger on a daily basis. Not very much fun. This year in Omaha, due to flooding, we are overrun with mosquitos. I decided to buy this Flowtron based upon reviews and I am so delighted I got this. I have both the Flowtron and the Stinger running on my property. Wow! The Flowtron attracts a lot more Mosquitos than the Stinger. The Flowtron requires less frequent cleaning and cleans much easier than the Stinger. The only negative I have for the Flowtron is it does not have a ""night time"" sensor. The only way to turn it off is to unplug it. I purchased a wireless outdoors remote to turn this on and off as needed. An extra $20.00 at wal-mart. That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars."
5,Love this item it works very well,"This item is great, it works very well and knocks down the flying bugs fast, this is the smaller one but for my area it is great, before it my girlfriend and myself could not go out into our back yard at night due to the major amount of moths and mosquitoes, if we were inside and turned on our kitchen light they would cover the screen door trying to get in, since we live in a remote area this thing is a life saver, once i put this outside the problem was over it zaps them real fast and the majority of them fall to the ground and lower part of it, it does require some cleaning at times but this one is far less work than any of the others out there, so if you have problems with flying bugs get this one, forget the stinger ones or the others out there they will just zap your money and not the bugs"
4,Seems to work well and customer service is helpful,I purchased this product in November 2009. in May 2010 one of the bulbs burned and I purchased replacement ones. The replacements bulbs did not work because apparently the actual socket has a problem. I tested the working socket and that seemed to work with the new bulbs but the one side where the bulb burned does not work. I called customer service and the problem is the starter for that bulb (a small device in the enclosure on top) and they said they will be sending me a replacement starter.
3,Does not kill flys,I have tried this for over 3 weeks now. It kills just about any flying insects except flys. I am somewhat disappointed because flys is the main problem I have.
1,"Terrible movie, read the reviews that give it one star...","This movie is just awful. I watched the first 10 minutes and thought it would be interesting. I was wrong. Anything the movie does well ends right before the real plot of the film starts. There's nothing interesting to it.If I were any of the people involved in this piece of garbage, I'd be sure to omit it from my resume."
5,Great movie for children and adults....,"This movie is funny and scary at the same time......watch before you let your children watch it in case they are too young to watch it, I have always been scared of witches and this is the perfect movie, the cast is fantastic and also Roald Dahl wrote the book!"
5,Great movie - even as an adult!,"I loved this movie when I was a kid, and I still love it as an adult. It's a pretty strange movie, but I give it 2 thumbs up!"
4,Childhood memories,"I remember watching this movie when I was in Elementary school, it seemed like it was a fairly long movie. I bought it and it wasn't as long as I thought. My husband had never seen it before and thought it was quite funny. It brought back memories of being young and hopefully my kids will enjoy it as much as I did."
5,The Witches review,"Wonderful movie, had seen it years ago when the kids rented it from the local video store, watched it over and over. Wanted to add to my collection and was happy to find it here at Amazon. Would recommend to older children who understand the concept of witches and magic."
4,Great for the Classroom,"I bought this to use as a classroom supplement when we read The Witches by Roald Dahl, and it was the perfect visual aid. It stays true to the book for a majority of the time, and the few differences were used to open discusssion. Plus, it's a fun movie to watch with really interesting special effects!"
5,I remeber it vividly from my childhood and I had to own it.,"I loved this film from start to finish and I would recommend seeing it if you haven't already.I love all the wonderful characters and the wonderful story line. I laughed and even became a little frightened at times. If you want to see a great film, ad The Witches to your video collection. It is one of the late Jim Henson's greatest works."
3,May not be appropriate for younger children,"I bought this movie for my 7 year old grandson who loves scary things. He has a 4 year old brother as well. We made it to the scene where the witches gather at a hotel and remove their masks (their normal faces)and become witches. I admit that even I thought they were horrid, scary looking things. Both children totally freaked out and one began crying. I almost couldn't get them to bed. I wish I had known that this may not be suitable for children of this age group. I intend to finish watching the movie when they're not around to see how the rest of it goes and if there's areas we can fast forward through. So, if you have young children, I'd stay away from this one until they're older."
2,DVD NOT WIDESCREEN!!!,"This was a fantastically great movie so WHY, WHY, WHY is the DVD only a pan & scan, 1.33 : 1 aspect ratio embarrassment instead of a glorious 2.35 : 1 aspect ratio like it was originally shown in theatres? Hopefully, this mistake will be rectified soon. I simply refuse to waste the money on a pan & scan DVD of a movie intended to be widescreen. If the DVD were widescreen I would rate it a 5/5, but as it is, it only deserves a 2/5."
3,the movie that got three star.,this was not what i was thinking of when i purchased it.so i will give it to a child.i really think that it is a two star movie.but oh well you win some u loss some.
4,Nice Film But,"I love this film everybody did a good job in it, the only two things that are disappointing are that the sound is'nt as good as it should be and picture presented in pan & scan not widescreen , i think the guys at warners should issue an update version of this film with the sound in 5.1 i think this wonderful fun film should deserve it, with behind the scenes , deleted and other wonderful goodies. may this happen one day to this wonderful film.But all in all i'd highly recommend this for the ages of9 & up"
4,Heh-heh-heh! The Witches is a smash hit!!!,The Witches is a story about when Luke & his grandma go on vacation. They meet the Grand High Witch!!! The witches are going to turn all the kids in England into mice! Can Luke & his grandma stop them? Find out!!!
5,Great family fun,"This is a wonderful movie for the whole family, young and old. Highly recommended for family night or kid's party."
4,Enjoyed this movie,"I enjoyed watching this movie with my daughter. We really liked the parts that Angelica Houston played. We will definately watch it again in the fall. There is a season for movies.Thank You, Amazon"
1,Here the greedy-guts go again.,"""Witches"" is a marvellous film: cleverly written and wittily produced. Alas, this is a mutilated copy: the usual tactic of corporate greed. The original, filmed in a ratio of 1.85:1, this copy has been mutilated -- slashed and hacked to leave a visual aspect of 1.33:1.If you want to buy this butchered version, go ahead. Just remember that you're missing about a third of the original. If steak is $5 s pound, would you pay $5 for 11 ounces? Just remember that the butcher still has his or her thumb on the scale, waiting to get your money again when she/he later offers correct weight for the price.If you still want to buy this thing, let me know. I have some riverside property in New Orleans I'd like to sell you."
1,dvd didnt work,i couldnt watch the movie as it was for a different region being USA and im in Australia so its sitting at home in the box still
3,witches review,"this movie got to me in a very timely fashion and was in good shape. I didn't prefer the movie all that much, I had actually thought it was a different one but this had nothing to do with the seller. Thanks anyway - Sheri"
5,Adults & Kids alike will LOVE it!,"I am still scratching my head on this one (no, I'm not a witch!). This movie has *everything* --Special effects, humour, excitement, joy, sadness, and yes, a superlative performance by Angelica Houston. So why did Warner Bros. decide to ""sneak"" this film into theatres and then quickly let it die, with little marketing? Who knows! It deserves so much more. Parents will appreciate the slightly twisted (if not cruel) humour, while children will delight in the cuteness of it all. I just can't say enough about Angelica Houston's performance. She's actually even *funnier* in this film with full makeup on. Anyone can spend 4 hours a day getting into full makeup and look good, but she actually transcends the appliances and TRULY becomes the Grand High Witch. ""...child....is a mouse!"" Jasen Fisher is also a delight as Luke (a Chicago accent in Europe though...but hey, he's a cute kid). See this movie. I promise, you'll be glad you did! Oh, and ""who spoke? It vas you? """
4,The Witches' real magic,Jim Henson meets Roald Dahl? What more need be said? This is a great movie for kids. It's imaginitive and scary but not over the top gory and just cartoonish enough for the little ones to enjoy. Anjelica Houston as the Grand High Witch was a stroke of casting genius. She's chews the scenery and rivals her green-faced counter part from The Wizard of Oz...another witch not too fond of the little ones. This is a BUY not RENT film for any kids with an imagination.
5,Great,havent seen this since i was a child in elementary and watching it again make you love it even more!!!
5,Favorite movie as a kid!,"I used to watch this all the time when I was a kid. Don't get me wrong, it was a little scary with the witches and green smoke and whatnot, but it was a good movie :D"
3,Things Change,"It's not what I remember as a kid. It actually creeps me out more now, but it's not a bad movie."
5,Great childhood classic,"I loved this movie growing up and I got it for my 51/2 year old to watch, he loves it and my nearly 3 year old will watch it too. Great buy!!! B"
4,Fun,This movie was a great deal of fun. There was never a dull moment.It went full bore for the entire show!I would buy it again.Amazon always gives me a great price!!
5,Cute Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, but the main witch may scare little children, when she removes her daytime face. Great price."
3,The Witches,"I bought this DVD from Amazon, a company I trust to have the best prices and very good follow-up service. This is a cute fantasy movie. It's one I enjoyed watching with my kids because they liked it so much. I wouldn't recommend it for the smaller kids, but school age kids would get a kick out of it. It's about a little boy and his adventures with his grandmother after they cross paths with the ""grand high witch"" and chaos follows. It takes place in Norway & England. Amazon has always been quick with my orders and they have arrived in good condition. They also stand behind their products and the only few small problems have been handled quickly and to my satisfaction."
5,gift,i gave this as a gift to three little boys and they loved it so much they watch it once a week. good price also!
2,Wonderful Film...NOT LETTERBOXED!,"Here we go again, just like The Trouble With Angels...the film is full screen and ruined! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT TILL IT'S ON TCM! IDIOTS!!!!"
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I SAW!,"This movie was TERRIFIC! I read this book before I saw the movie. The book was very well (duh)written, and one of my friends had seen the movie and she said that if I had read the book and liked it, then I just HAD to see the movie! So one day I was out shopping with my mom and a couple friends,me and my friends were looking at the movie section and I saw the movie The Witches and I pick it up, run out of the video section, and go looking for my mother. She said I could get the movie! As soon as we got home I inserted the movie in the VCR. I LOVED the movie (and boy do I mean LOVED)! I highly recomend this movie! If you don't have it ... ADD IT TO YOUR COLLECTION!"
4,loved it,"My girls aged 7 and a half and 5 loved this movie,and so did I for that matter. From the moment Luke's grandmother starts telling him all about witches and how you could tell if someone is a witch, we were enthralled! If your kids get easily scared, then i wouldn't recommend it. If my nieces were to watch this they wouldn't be able to sleep by themselves for a month. Not that it's over the top scary, but just the theme of the movie might get some little ones paranoid. My kids love a great story and once we've watched it together, they'll watch it on their own afterward.Great story and great special effects to keep the kids captivated."
2,Watch out for that potion!,"The Witches is a book about a boy and his grandmother who live in England. The boy's grandmother tells him everything there is to know about witches. One day the boy is caught by some witches. They use a potion to turn him into a mouse and suceed. The boy and his grandmother use the rest of the potion to turn the other witches into mice.I found it interesting how the author made witches have different appearences besides pointy hats and broomsticks. In this book the witches were bald,have no toes, square feet, and long claws."
1,DONT GET THIS IF YOU LIKED THE BOOK!,"I loved the book, so when I saw this, I was HORRIBLY disappointed. It *butchered* Dahl's work. The only way someone could get me to watch this again (I had to be forced to watch it after I wanted to get up after the first 15 minutes) is if they strapped me down and forced me to keep my eyes open on pain of death. The entire hotel scene was awful, and the part with his grandmother at the beginning was so... disgustingly off of the book. I would run out of ways to describe my distaste of this movie before I ran out of things to complain about it! Do yourself a BIG favor and get the book instead, you'll be glad you did!"
1,Not even close to being a good movie!,I purchased this for my children and thought that with Angelica Houston in it that it would be good. I was wrong! It stinks! A big dissappointment to me. My kids like it okay but I would not suggest purchasing it because as a parent we might have to suffer through it with them. And believe me- I have suffered through it more than once.
1,a big don't for pagans,If you are pagan this movie is not for you. Yet again we are the bad guys and this movie is really scary if you are trying to raise pagan kids. It's truly a hideous amount of time you don't need to lose out of your life. This recommendation comes up if you order a lot of fantasy or pagan titles because of its theme.Anjelica Huston even scared the pants of our coven on our movie watching night. Its very negative until the end and the good witch appears at the end and you almost miss the fact that she's supposed to be a good witch.
2,Lame,"Lame attempt at making a Halloween show. Love, love, love Angelica Houston in anything, but this was beneath her."
1,Don't Waist Your Time,"Don't do it. If you are running 98,2k or even ME keep them on your pc. XP has been touted as the 'new wonder from MS'. Not so. If you know nothing about computers you won't even know what you are missing. But for those of you who do know your pc stay away. I would think that in a few years they might actually have it fully debugged, might...I was in the marked for a new lap top and ended up buying a Mac. There were many factors but the main factor was the operating system. After spending much time working in XP I just couldn't stand it any more. I use win2k at work and it's great, stable, fast, a good extension to 98, one of the best OS out there. When I heard Mac released a unix based OS, I jumped for joy and bought the Mac. You can't beat the stability, ability and control. It's time for the MS marketing department to lay off of trying to control the entire pc world and let the user have a choice in what the user wants to run on their pc and not what will make MS money."
1,Not Worth The Upgrade,"While Windows Xp is pretty to look at, the problems that came with it has made me regret buying it. First of all is the registration. I can hardly stand getting on my computer anymore due to all the registering, passwords, tweaking, pop up adds, ect. Secondly, out of 10 programs that I tried to load, three failed. Resident Evil 3 locks up, I could not install my scanner software, and a very important language program. All of these worked on 98, absolutely no problems. If this is your first computer, get Xp, but do not upgrade."
1,Windows XP Home Edition,"Overall, I think that Windows XP Home Edition is just the 2 bestest operator Systems put together in this one. It will not play some of my favorite games, either! It has a cool new 3D look to it, though, but I think that Windows Millennium Edition might be more compatible, but it's your choice! I just don't recommend it to some older game players."
1,XP Stinks,Don't waste your money. I upgraded from ME to XP and ended up having to Format and reinstall ME. I won't waste any more time reviewing a product that shouldn't be on the market.
1,Terrible!,"Loaded with security flaws, this operating system is the worst yet. That combined with the fact that when new software is installed, XP deletes drivers which are needed for the OS to operate properly make for a terrible software package. So far I have had to do a complete reinstall on my computer twice because of this. If you can stand it, buy a Linux OS or a Mac...it doesn't appear that Windows is ever going to come out with a decent operating system."
1,"Be ready to pay ""X""tra for ""XP""","How do you feel if after paying for a home remoding project then the contractor asks you for more money if you want to use the bathroom or operate the garage door opener. After upgrading from Windows ME to XP, my HP CD burner is no longer working (you have to ""buy"" the upgrade software - CD Creator 5), Norton system works 2001 and Norton anti virus 2001 also require an update, DLink video cam has to be reinstalled, etc....""XP"" means ""Xtra Payment"" if you want true MS eXPerience. If you want to upgrade, go with Windows 2000, or better yet, buy a new GeForce video card."
1,XP=poop on a stick.,If you want an os with an X get a mac and stop whinging. OS X.1 rules. I do own a PC with win2K and it runs great so dont call me bias. Pi is exactly 3!!!!
1,It could definitly be better,"Windows XP has some nice features but it took away ALOT of good old features we are all use to, You cant control any hardware aspects or changes and The lisence is a pain in the Butt if you love to try out lots of new hardware. My opinion Win98 is just great and lets you control alot more than this new version."
5,10 Months And Zero Crashes On 3 Computers,"Its true folks. I installed Windows XP Home Edition on three different computers on Oct 25, 2001. Not one of those computers has had a single crash since then."
3,Infantile OS,"I was dissapointed with WinXP. Not because I'm a Windows- hater but because it was too simply of an OS. I'm used to NT and Win2kPro. It doesn't give me enough options and settings. It's just way to easy. If any one wanted an OS that they really don't have to think to use, this is the one for you."
3,Great but beware...,"I got XP on my new Compaq PC as delivered. I like the interface and the multimedia stuff. However, we can't play Jane's F/A-18 (95/98 only), my external Philips CDRW won't work, etc. Some old favorite software titles just freak out. The only things that will work are new products for XP that were designed by Microsoft or their ""partners"". I'm told I just have to wait until drivers are developed. Some companies have no intention of doing that. Great. Now I have to upgrade my old 98 workhorse with more memory and a better video card to play the flight simulators. Or put 98 on the new PC. So much for paying ""X""tra for XP. Now I have to buy the ""Plus"" pack to even have Solitaire - come on..."
4,This is a great OS - but XP Prof is better,I have this OS on most all my home PC's. Windows XP Professional is better...but if you use XP Home for your home its probably all you'll need. Oh yeah - download Service pack 2 - its a great upgrade with security features. It even blocks your pop up ads. I am so glad to have that. TIP - back up critical files before downloading any service pack. I didn't have any trouble but its a good practice.
1,1 star is too many,"Microsoft has mangaged to take a mediocre OS and turn it into complete junk. It's not really dificult to use for most normal tasks, it just makes them more frustrating. My real problem is the hardware compatability issue. So far my sound card and DSL modem will not work with this OS. I've downloaded the driver updates and still the hardware will not work.Honestly, I'd recomend sticking with Win98 se, or if you are just sick of Windows alltogether, try Red Hat Linux. Linux is not as easy to use as Windows, but it is much cheaper (some versions are free) and can be altered to suit your needs.If you want to give it a try I recomend buying Red Hat Linux 7 Weekend Crash Course, by Nabba Barkakati. It comes with a copy of Linux and will get you through the basics in no time, though probably not a weekend. A background in DOS or Unix would help also, but it's not necessary."
2,No Web Server included like in Windows 98,I was very *very* disappointed to find out (after the purchase) that not only does it lack a web server (IIS or Personal Web Server) but you CAN'T install one. You are forced to pay EVEN MORE for the PRO upgrade. What a load of [dissapointment!] The 2 star rating would be a 4 or 5 if not for this fact alone....
1,Another POS from MS,"MS manage to change the Interface again. For existing users of Windows, this beast takes some time to get used to. I find myself constantly looking at help, looking for some stupid menu item. It makes experienced user feels like ignorant as the Windows beginners.Comes with many small programs, but many times, I rather pay for professional software than deal with more of MS [stuff]. All this unwanted features gets in the way of accomplishing my goals.Comming from Windows 2000, I did not see much of speed advantage.Beginners of Windows may like all the extra featurs, but as an experienced user, I cannot get any work done with this POS."
1,Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition,"I currently and unfortunately own and use this operating system.I have owned and used other Microsoft Operating System software in the past and compared to them, Windows XP Home Edition stinks. Out of all of the past operating systems, I feel that Microsoft Windows ME is the best of the best. Windows XP is just a lot of hype and is not even close to operating systems in the past."
2,The end of owning software.,"Lots of new features come with the OS. this much is nice. My main gripe is that you can't upgrade your machine or move the OS to another machine without major trouble. Change more than a network card a couple of other items and your OS won't work. This is MS's harebrained scheme to stop people from copying the OS.Whatever you do, make sure you don't use this software if all you have is a dial-up connection.I will be avoiding this OS version as long as possible."
2,XP = Xtremely Poor,"Every day my new Dell super duper, high quality, desktop crashes and burns. Every day I send ""error reports"" to Microsoft. When I sent a complaining e-mail, I was invited to their web site where I learned that, FOR A PRICE, I can get some pesonal attention for a new product which fails to provide the speed, stability, and efficiency of my Win 2000 program running on my notebook. Yes, XP does have attractive features re: multi media, enhanced plug and play, etc. But what good is all that if the FIXES (SP-1) are worse than the cure. Will someone please tell Microsoft: ""Bill Gates has no clothes."" You are releasing, prematurely, wave after wave of buggy programs so that a multi-billionare can rule the computer world. Give me a solid alternative and I WILL NEVER RETURN TO MICROSOFT AGAIN. Just give me a true choice. [Dell would not even sell me a desktop with Win 2000 on it!]"
3,xp home edition,"I went to put this on my computer and already had a better version on my computer, so I couldn't use it"
1,can't rate it lower,Windows xp is the greatest os there is but only if you never plan to use your computer for anything but xp. Everything you add to you computer runs slower. If you put on software to do something xp doesn't like it in fact it fights with the new program to try to get you to use something ms put in xp. The operating system itself works (but has many flaws) but the intergrated software (which you can't uninstall) won't let you do anything you want to do (windows media player being the worst) If you like music or your cd burner stay away from xp.
2,"Not thrilled, but some nice stuff...","WinXP came with my new Gateway laptop. It's got some nice features, like restore, but they hardly make up for my 2 biggest complaints. 1: My Canon Multipass will not print correctly. Canon sent me a disk, I've downloaded the drivers, and nothing helps. Now I'll have to go get a new printer or hire a geek to fix the problem. 2: I never got instant message pop-ups with 95 or 98 and I can't find a way to make them stop. I never use instant messenger but I can't figure out how to turn it off or delete it entirely. Overall, I miss my relatively dependable Win98. Just to be fair, I only use my computer for simple games, shopping, e-mail, and writing, so I probably have way more computing power than I'll ever need. I even installed an ancient copy of Microsoft Works (from 95) because I don't like the new Word programs, so it's not like I really know what I'm doing geek-wise."
4,The Best Home Edition Ever Released,"It is a great deal, BUT Microsoft should review their activation policy, since that I cannot install the same disk I bought on my laptop, so I have to go and buy another one for the SAME PRICE again!! This will surly decrease the market demand, it will give a ""boom"" to competitors in this condition, specially there are new regulations against Microsoft OS market policy. I suggest a small fee can be represented in activation for a whole new platform, something like that. Thank you."
5,A great XP-erience,"After what I think, this is one of the best 'Windows' editions ever, it's both colorful and useful, and there is many new ways to make better shortcuts."
2,"Great Concept, Just Not Ready","Once again, Microsoft has put out a product that is not ready yet. I resent paying $200 to be a beta tester for Microsoft. The install was going along smoothly until a report came out that said almost all of my devices might not work. I guess I should be thankful that I was informed about this before the new o/s was completly installed. I am not returning it, I am just going to wait until it is fully supported.The thing that bothers me most is that the devices that I use are not uncommon or obscure. They are mainstream things like a printer, scanner, router, cable modem, etc..I purchased Win ME several moths ago and installed that instead. That seems to be the theme with MS, buy it when it comes out and wait until you can use it."
1,SMH,"This movie is clearly low budget.... It is hilarious to watch to make fun of but, I wouldn't waste my money on it.I've seen better actors in my high school drama club... as a thespian.... the acting makes me want to slam my head against the wall..Vampireism is an STD??? Umm What in the world was the writer thinking? :/This is like Twilight except Twilight had some better actors and that is saying something... Save your money on something better like Fright Night or The Lost Boys but, not this crap."
5,Dating tips for guys written by women.,"This book has a lot going for it.Great advice on dating tips and techniques and written by women too.I enjoyed this book and loved the advice.This book is like a woman with a credit card,I couldnt put it down until I finished with it.A better book than I had anticipated.These women explain the tips in simple terms without being boring.A great book and great value.I also recommend these books:1)""U.S.S."" By Leil Lowndes.(means:undercover sex signals)2)""Date out of your league:for men only"".By April Masini.3)""How to pick up beautiful women:secrets every man should know"".By John Eagan.You can find more books on ""dating,"" how to pick up girls"",etc on this site."
4,A Great Guide To Obtaining More Than Just Cut Abs,"Kudos to Shawn Phillips. Absolution is an excellent book that teaches how you can get great abs. It dispels the notion that great abs are gained by merely performing ab exercises. Spot focusing just doesn't work. In this book, Shawn explains that excellent abs come only by consistant and intense strength training over the whole body and by using a healthy diet. Good job, Shawn.-Craig Nybo"
1,Lame Lame Lame !!,"If you have $ to burn, then buy the book. If you like to waste $, buy the book. If you are smart, DON'T buy the book. It tells nothing new, Shawn Phillips is just envious of his more successful and richer younger brother Bill and is trying to make a buck on the Phillips bandwagon, ie, Bill's shirt tail.Speaking of tails[tales really] this book is a fairy tale if you think you can look like Shawn following his book. He forgets the small detail about steroids, diuretics and extreme shredder dieting before a photo shoot.SAVE YOUR $ AND DO NOT BUY."
1,The Next Step...,"Honestly, this book is the biggest waste of time and effort I can possibly imagine. The book provides nothing useful in terms of new information. In fact in one of the most laughable sections we read about how working out is our way of helping to heal the USA after 9/11. What a LOAD of BUNK!! Is this Shawn's way of reaching out after the tragedy? Bwaahahaha! It is basically a book dedicated to the narcissism of an aging 39 year old who has lived his whole life pumping up his midsection. It is obvious where the brains in this outfit belong and that is with the younger brother...Bill. If you want a book worth reading then maybe Body for Life, this is no BFL 2 so do not be fooled.Quickly, I will sum up. Don't eat a lot of crap. Flex your abs at the top, look at me in my briefs, look at me with some chick, look at me ...look at me. Got it? Good...now don't waste your time or money like I did."
1,CAN YOU SAY...STEROIDS???,"What I dislike so much about the muscle media crew now that they have gone mainstream is their lack of honesty. Why don't they mention their steroid use anymore? Bottom line, this book provides discipline but this you can find within yourself IF you really want to look like Shawn Phillips and a few cycles of steriods wouldn't hurt either..."
3,"Nice coffee table book, but I was a little let down","I have been following Ken Brungardt's book ""The Complete Book of Abs."" I was looking for some refinements from that book, which is quite comprehensive. Although ABSolution is a a good looking book, I find it to be more about Shawn Phillips and his brother Bill than about helping me further refine my ab workout.ABSolution is a super start for someone who has done no ab work at all. But if you are more advanced or need a structured program with a day-to-day plan, I would recomend ""The Complete Book of Abs."""
3,GREAT for motivation - little thin on content...,"The first thing that strikes you upon opening Shawn's book are the fantastic gloss art high quality photographs that show what fantastic shape he's in. No question this man has great abs.Unfortunately the same can not be said for his writing style nor ability to convey the information necessary to achieve these results! The actual programme to me is a slight rehash of huis brother Bill's book 'Body for Life' and I read the book cover to cover without learning a single fact I had not already been taught in Body for Life.Don't get me wrong however, the book got me off my butt and into the gym! But it was a source of INSPIRATION as opposed to INFORMATION.For my money I'd buy Body for Life as a complete 'how to' guide to changing your physique (it certainly changed mine). However, if you need a good motivational kick, then most certainly grab a copy."
1,Not what they claim,I have taught aerobics for 7 years and worked out with weights for over 6 years now. I cannot get a 6 pack. I saw this book being advertised at the gym several times before ordering and actually I did enjoy the BFL book so I finally ordered ABSolution. Unfortunately it is a waste of money for anyone who has the slightest bit of knowledge about working out. There are no secret tips here or no unique excercise that you have not already seen. I found myself skimming through the book to get to the exercises at the end. As I said earlier if your a novice to the gym this is a good start ... All he states is that you need to eat right 24/7 and do your workouts. Duh? I didn't need to spend [$$] on pictures.
4,A useful addition to my fitness library,I think that this is a very good book. I do not agree with the reviewers who have trashed the book and the author. The text is concise and simple. It does not claim to be Arnold's Encyclopedia but it gives a good program in a straightforward and easy to understand format. I do agree that the hardback is too expensive. I was lucky and found a discounted paperback. I am glad that I purchased it and consider it a useful addition to my fitness library.
4,Good book...good info...good pictures.,"I've seen this book cover to cover and while his brother Bill Phillips I'm sure was Shawn's ""in"" with the publication of this book, I do feel that the info contained is solid. Check out GREGG AVEDON's web site for great info as well. His site is under his name GREGGAVEDON(dot)com! He was named among the top 5 abs guys in the industry by People Magazine (August 2003).In any case...I would reccomend you flip through this book while in the book store. It's a hard cover ""coffee table"" style book and I'm not sure if it will ever be made into soft cover."
1,Plagerism -,"This book was a waste. it was a rewrite of BFL. I didn't learn anything new, in fact I returned the book.too many pictures to fill space.big disappointment."
5,Best Map of Rome,"I have been in Rome now for almost four months with this map and it is simply fantastic. Not only does it include Rome's center with very good detail, its also has held up incredibly well, and has bus, train and tram routes. I've looked at all the other maps while I've been here but this map is simply the very best. If you are going to go to Rome, get one of these maps. The only potential drawback is that it does not have the outlying areas but most people traveling to Rome will not need a map with a larger area. It you need a broader area map with bus routs, then you can buy the ATAC map at a tourist info station for I think about 4 euros."
2,Talented musician but .... well... boring,"I purchased this based on an interest in high quality instrumental music and the rave reviews. There can be no doubt Mehdi is a talented musician, but I too found the music boring. I kept looking at the track numbers to see if I was still on track #1. They all sound (roughly) the same, no major change in tempo or phrasing. Nice, soothing, but very repititous. In my view, this is more suited for background music than to be the focus itself. I have to admit the words that kept coming to my head as I listened to it a 2nd and third time were ""elevator music"". I believe the point to be made is also voiced by those who raved about it. This music may not be for everyone (what is). If you're new to this composer, sample it first to see if you'll like it."
2,mehdi - over-rated elevator music,"I bought this hoping for ""Enigma"" style excitement - no such luck. It is sickly sweet, soft and spacey - but BORING. Every time you think an exciting passage is eminent - it just noodles off again. I certainly would only reccommend this to insomniacs!"
3,It's just ok,"From the other reviews, you would think that this was one of the best cd's ever. I love new age and other types of soothing music, and I know a little something about the genre. This cd is ok. There are maybe two or three songs that really stand out. I bought it after hearing Desert Oasis on Sky.FM's New Age station. None of the other songs even compare. Nice background music, but it did not inspire me to buy more from this artist."
3,2 Words,"Elevator Music. If you want to hear more distinct sounds try cds in another genre like Middle Eastern Music or New Age, or Celtic/Irish Dance music. I'm an Enya loving person because Enya's the Madonna of New Age- but Mehdi is the King of Elevator Music(on this one album because it's basically the only Mehdi I've heard.) Just based on the recent and possibly overrated reviews for this album, I am suprised- I'm all for good music but, original and transforming at the same time? On this album? Pour some blood on it. I gave it three stars because the instrumental is soothing- however, it's just very very boring. Hope this helps."
5,Brings back all of lifes sweetest & most cherished memories,"I listened to samples at soothingmusic.com and the first track ""Dream Garden"" caught my attention, especially towards the end so I listened to more and found myself drifting into some of my lifes sweetest memories. I decided that I had to have this album and now that I've listened to it several times at work on the computer, it's truly remarkable. The melodies are simple but powerful and not at all intrusive. This CD is worth so much more than the price I paid for it because it has done more than just make my day go better. It has renewed my faith and I geuss you could say it is gradually becoming a soundtrack to my own life. I hope you are reading this Mehdi cause as your music plays in the background I am writing from my heart!"
5,This artist should be world famous!,"What a talented artist, this album has such passion and heart that it does'nt even seem possible. It has definitely become one of my all time favorites."
5,Instrumental Odyssey... perfect after a long day.,I listen to this and all the other awesome CDs by Mehdi while driving home in rush hour traffic. They just make me feel like I don't even want to leave the car. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM ALL to anyone who wants a nice break from the stresses of life even if it's just for an hour.
5,"Very satisfied, wonderful book about fiction writing",Although it took about 1.5-2 weeks to come by mail...I am overall happy with my purchase!
1,Absolutely inpenetrable,"I have always found this book to be pendantic, abstract, and utterly useless when it comes to actually writing. Unfortunately, teachers keep assigning it--so it sits on my shelf unless I am forced to reread another chapter. Otherwise, I'd recycle it--it's that pointless to what I'm trying to accomplish with my writing."
4,"Great book, but....","The others tell about it already. If you can find an earlier edition of the book, save your money and get that. I was angry when I took a higher level creative fiction class and had to upgrade to the 7th edition, when I had a perfectly good 6th edition on my bookshelf. The main differences I can see are the order of the chapters, and some of the short stories used.All that said, this is a great book with wonderful insight. I would highly recommend it."
1,Cheaply made set,"This set was a chore to set up. After all of that trouble, the set kept falling down. It's not sturdy at all. On numerous occasions, the kids had to stop playing in order to fix this thing."
3,Volleyball set all cracked,"The kids were thrilled to get volleyball for Christmas and set it up immediatly. The posts that go into the ground were cracked in half within minutes of trying to push them into the ground. We're now playing with a flimsy set, just ""making do"" until we can get some replacement posts. The set looks good, is inexpensive and is fun, but too much plastic to be sturdy."
3,Good but not Great,At first I loved this item but I did find a few problems with it. I had set this up as part of a display for the full month of October and several times I noticed that it would appear in a different spot or pose than I had placed it previously.I also found it to be especially prone to red stains which were very difficult to remove and also at times discovered loose bones found beneath the horse but could not replace them as it was not obvious where they should go. All in all it is a good prop as people really seem to react to it. But due to the persistent issues you may want to obtain a more reliable prop.
4,"Great prop, if handled carefully","I'm sorry I bought this prop to the old folks home where I used to work as I am now the subject of a lawsuit brought by the families of ex-residents who accuse me of causing severe emotional shock resulting in several fatal cardiac arrests.My ex-employer is taking a similarly hard line and is suing me for traumatising his staff (who are all off work with stress and depression) and for the loss of business caused by the bad publicity surrounding these tragic deaths.On the upside, it is amazingly realistic."
3,Okay I guess,"Decent, I suppose.I went to an old folks home and waited a few hours for one of them to die. When the inevitable happened, and the grim reaper came around to collect their soul, I stopped him for a moment and had him come over to view my recent purchase.He agreed that it looked somewhat like him, but was overall a poor attempt.Good for a prop, but don't count on realism."
2,"This isn't funny, Chad!!!","Ok, so like, my parents got this awful decoration for our manor out in the woods, where no one is around for miles. They run it as a haunted house normally, but obviously, they aren't using it in the middle of Winter. So, my boyfriend and I decided to throw a little Christmas party there, with all our attractive 18-26 year old friends, with us all coming back from college and stuff.And all I can say is, stop moving this thing around, Chad! It isn't funny anymore!! Where the hell is he, anyway?God, I'm so sick of not having cell reception around here. Ugh. Also, the storm is just getting worse. The power better not get cut, or I will seriously cut someone.On the plus side, it's very realistic, to the point where the scythe is sharp enough to cut skin pretty easily.Chad!??! Is that you?"
4,How the post works,Great explanation text for younger students. Even though US based still valid to use in Aus.
3,Just O.K.,This book is very basic. I needed a book for a post office theme and this was boring to read aloud and redundant (not repetitive). Could have been written better.
2,I'd like to read a biography instead of this self-serving autobiography,"Autobiographies have a problem: Their authors are not likely to say anything particularly negative about the subject. This is a book in which Glenn ratifies the conventional wisdom that he is a four-square American hero.A more complete biography would dig deeper into his transformation into a typical politician, sharing that occupation's tendency to put one's own interests ahead of the nation's. Glenn did this when he supported the perjury-committing, perjury-suborning President Clinton -- and was rewarded by Clinton (in another time-honored political tradition of quid pro quo) by being given a slot on a space shuttle mission."
2,A Remarkable Life But....,"Not such a remarkable autobiography. John Glenn has lead one of the most interesting lives of the 20th century so why is his book so dull? Perhaps it's because he has never had a crises of faith, never had a fight with his wife, never had a disagreement with his parents, never questioned the values of his childhood.How very odd. Glenn has done more with his life than any ten people I know and yet I find myself wondering if he has ever suffered any adversity."
3,Failed Attempt,"In the end this book is a failed attempt by a man to justify a view of himself as a great patriot. He is quilty, and he knows it, of defending the worst President in american history, i.e., William Jefferson Clinton. This is an attempt to try to separate himself from Clinton by trying to make himself a hero. If he had the ""Right Stuff"" he would have protected this country from further damage and ""Betrayel"" of this country by Clinton. Glenn fails in his attempt to separate himself from Clinton...Glenn will go down in history as one of Clinton's most important defenders. Glenn does not have the ""Right Stuff""....He has the ""Cowardly Stuff"" of a politician."
4,One of the Memoir/Bio Generation 1999,"It is curious that as 2000 nears, so many memoir biographies have hit the stands...and so many worth reading. We have Glenn's story...astronaut turned politician, model American; Nabokov's story...scientist turned literary celebrity (Nabokov's Blues); Goodall's story...scientist turned reflective (Reason to Hope); Sagan...by Sagan AND by biographers. Glenn's memoir fits this mold...a man has taken time out not only to reflect but to share with his ""fellow Americans"" his insights on the last decades, indeed some of the most important events of the millenium. I recommend this book; its only drawback is it might be argued as less exciting than some of the others mentioned above. But John Glenn is a major public and historical figure and it is worth the time to digest here what he has to say about his life, and times."
3,This could have been a lot better...,"I really didn't know what to make of this book. I mean, one could argue that John Glenn has done some of the most exciting things that a person who lived in the past 100 years could do: He fought in two wars as a fighter pilot during the golden age of aviation and at the dawn of the jet age, he was the first american to orbit the earth, and he flew in space at the age of 77, in addition to being a multi-term senator from Ohio! But despite all of this his book was so dull I could not believe it! Somehow even his descriptions of combat were dull! I honestly did not know what to make of it all. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for him to get to the meat of the book and to inflect the writing with some verve... but it just never happened. As a die-hard space and aviation enthusiast, i would only reccommend this book to those interested in hearing some hithero undocumented anecdotes abot the Mercury program."
4,Excellent beginning biography,"This biography provided an excellent primer to John Glenn's life. The book is highly readable. Although, I did wish that he would have covered in greater depth his experiences during the intial formation of the Mercury 7. It did make up for this by examining the beginnings of his political theories. I do suggest this book to anyone who wishes to gain a broad overview of this man's life."
3,"Decent, but repetetive","This book does contain some decent information on losing weight, aerobic exercise and body-building. Unfortunately, the entire book is written in a very repetetive style that makes reading several chapters in a row quite a chore. In addition, there's a lot of evidence of cut-and-paste editing throughout the book as well. For instance, the book may mention ""Dr. Joe Bloggs"" in 8 or 9 different chapters. However, in every chapter, the writers will ""re-introduce"" as though this is the first time he/she has been mentioned, and with nearly identical text: ""Dr. Joe. Bloggs, a PhD from Harvard University and a world-renowned physioloigist who also won the Nobel Prize in 1978 and is currently teaching at Brown, had this to say ..."" It seems like a minor annoyance, but after several chapters with several of the same experts, it becomes quite monotonous.The book does have good information, as I mentioned, but there are simply better books out there."
3,I don't know what to say,"I saw a ""complimentary"" copy of this book at a Veteran's Administration hospital. My first thought was, ""Banish your Belly. What a thought!""I have no intentions of being a he-man, sports athlete, bodybuilder. But I am interested in a healthy diet, exercise and a good figure.I might buy this book from elsewhere, like [...]. Provided that the book is cheap enough at that site."
5,"Great for parties, easy to listen to","The Ultra-Lounge series is overall is GREAT. I bought a couple of these CD's at first to try out, and also because I wanted to have some nice background music for a dinner party. I immediately purchased 3 more after that, and I'm really pleased. The songs are cool and set a really nice atmosphere if you're having guests over."
3,mambo lite,"Mambo is probably one of the best known genres of music to dance to. Sadly, this is lounge music mambo and not really the good stuff. I have found of six Ultra Lounge CDs I own in this series, this is one of the ones I hardly ever play.I personally would have preferred this to be more SCTV John Candy ""Let's Mambo!"" funny. At least the liner notes are a hoot."
4,"A toe taping, body moving kind of thing . . . .","After purchasing Volume 1 in this series, ""Mondo Exotica"", I was expecting more of the same. Wrong! This CD will make your body move - if it doesn't, you must be dead! Much more of a crowd pleaser than ""Mondo Exotica"", ""Mambo Fever"" works equally well as background music AND something you actually listen to. An example of the great tunes to be found here is a Mambo version of ""Hooray for Hollywood"" - awesome! My goal is to eventually collect all the CD's in the series - if all the rest are as good as these first two volumes, it will be money well spent."
2,Disappointing Features,"What a shame - an excellent printer marred by a lousy driver and horrible technical support.You buy this for the low price, fast speed, 1200 dpi, watermarking, poster mode, manual duplexing.You install it and find the driver will not support manual duplexing, watermark, poster mode, 1200 dpi!Samsung wants you to buy a several hundred dollar postscript board and memory upgrade.Save your money and buy something else from aaanother manufacturer."
3,No fun,"This book takes away the entire fun of the game.If the game is too hard 4 U,you might as well get it,but I would recommend playing the game with out this book.This is a helpful book,but it ruins the game if you keep on looking at this book when you get stuck.The game is fun cause you solve it but this book tells you everything making he game worth not playing cause you already know what to do when this or that happens"
1,Save your money,"Save your money and buy something of quality. The blade wabbles and doesn't cut the food evenly. It can't handle anything of any weight, it couldn't even handle carrots very well. They fell over and were sliced length wise instead of the way I had put them in. The center mounting piece broke apart with working with chocolate. The machine was loud even when brand new and it produced an odor similar to the power tools they make. I will be saving my money for a better quality food processor."
4,Noisy processor,"I have had this for about 8 months and it works very well, however it is VERY noisy."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I purchased this item thinking I was getting a great deal for the money. I understood that I was buying a reconditioned product but when I got it home to use it, it was dead out of the box. Since I only spent [price] on it, it wasn't a huge deal but the next food processor I buy will be new and I will spend the money for the quality."
2,Lovely but poor quality,"I bought this as a gift but the glue won't hold and the stones keep falling out and now some of them are lost, so I now i have to find a different style to replace this one. For what I paid, the pentacle is lovely and the quality would have been excellent if the stones were affixed some other way."
1,Not very good quality,"My first order was somehow lost in the mail so I had to have it shipped to me a second time. When I finally received the necklace/pendant I was very disappointed by the quality of the pendant. The ""stones"" look like they are plastic and they appear to be glued onto the pendant, which wouldn't be so bad if they were glued on straight. Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone and I am returning it to the vendor."
3,"Beautiful, for a little while.","I purchased this for my boyfriend(now husband), he loved it and wore it every day. After a couple of weeks, we noticed one of the stones was missing. Then a couple weeks later another. This went on and we finally had to get rid of it. It's evidently not for every day use at all. I do have to say that it was beautiful while it lasted."
1,cheaply made and poor quality,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 14 YR OLD DAUGHTER AND WITHIN 2 WEEKS THE STONES FELL OUT. THEY WERE ONLY GLUED TO THE PENDANT. THE METAL STARTED TO TARNISH AT ABOUT 3 WEEKS. THIS IS VERY POORLY MADE. THE STONES ARE GLUED ON AND THE METAL TARNISHES. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
3,Great Product,"It has been a while since I purchased this product, but as I recall it was just what I needed. I buy alot of products with tea tree oil in them, and use them for my bedridden parent. They have been a great help to me. It does have a distinct smell. So far I have used the oil, lotion, and bath wash. I currently use the bath wash, and am finding it at Walmart in a large pump container at a reasonable price. Of the 3 products it has a much nicer smell."
3,Not Impressed,"I haven't used it much because of the unpleasant smell. It didn't seem to do any harm, but it also didn't help my skin abraison much either.The shipped packaging was just about non-existant. The small bottle had been thrown into a big box that was not properly secured. The bottle had nearly fallen out..."
5,Effective and useful natural skin remedy,"The local health store was out of tea tree oil antiseptic cream so I ordered 4 bottles online from Amazon.com. I apply it in my hands and lower arms after washing with liquid anti-fungal soap that I ordered with it. It soothes and help the skin heal without worrying about side effects as do pharmaceutical drugs have. It smells astringent-like but it does not bother me. I apply it at night and by the following day, there is hardly any smell. It is the best remedy I know for skin problems such as fungal infection, insect bites, minor cut and scrapes, minor burns, etc."
3,Fear no evil,Well written characters good story line. Only problem is that it's not hard to figure out how story will end
5,Love this series!,"This is a great series! I picked up the first book on a whim and have steadly been reading from there. Allison Brennan does an amazing job catching your heart with the romance, but the books are action packed from beginning to end."
5,This book could keep you up at night...,"Yes, it has that much of an impact. The content is hard to read. The psychopath is deeply disturbing. And, you won't be able to put the book down!Lucy Kincaid is just about to graduate when she does the unthinkable. She agrees to meet an online friend in person... Every parent's worse nightmare, right? Then, she disappears.What poor Lucy goes through is unspeakable, unforgiving, and terrifying to think about. Her experiences are broadcast over the Internet. Her older brother, Dillon Kincaid is determined to find her and save her.Dillon seeks out the help of FBI agent Kate Donovan. She's had her own experiences with this psychopath and she is the only one that can help him track the bad guy down.Lucy, Dillon and Kate are the type of characters that will forever imprint on your memory. A fantastic story, a wonderful book and an unforgettable plot. I definitely recommend this book! It will become one that I will reread."
5,AWESOME!,"I absolutely adore Allison Brennan's books. Although I have not read one if a very long time, they were always page turners, suspenseful, and I could never put the books down. I enjoyed her way of having the books suspenseful mysteries, with a little romance thrown in with the hero in the book, whether it was the cop, detective, or other hero in the book. Some of her books spooked me out a little, and I can only describe it as me making sure my back was against the wall, and that I could see every inch of the room I was in. Great books, great reads, great author, really recommend!"
2,Phoning In the Evil,"I am in complete disagreement with most of the other reviewers. I really enjoyed the Prey/Hunt/Kill series, and the other 2 books in this series, but Brennan didn't deliver with this book. Her stories are scary, and show the brutality of rape & murder, without gratutious gore. She normally doesn't sugar coat the pain and violence involved in rape, but brings it to light, and then developes the rest of the story line. Her characters are strong, pretty well-developed & survivors. I am not sure if it is because the victim is a minor in this book, that she sort of glossed over the crimes committed against Lucy, but it wasn't well developed, nor were the two main characters brought as fully to life. Overall, the series worked, and I am glad I read it, but this was not a strong finish."
2,Disturbing,"I don't know why this book disturbed me so much, but it did. Maybe it's because we'd gotten to know the Kincaid family over the past two books, and I was a bit surprised to see the brutality leveled at so many of them. Regardless though, it made me very disturbed.This series was my first try with Allison Brennan. However, while the books were well-written, they were way too graphic and violent for my tastes. A good story can still be told without that level of violence, or such graphic storytelling.I don't think I'll be checking out anything more of hers."
2,misleading title,This book provides you with an inside look at the authors of well received memoirs. Authors of memoirs can frequently seem full of themselves and this book certainly doesn't hide that. It doesn't provide any palpable techniques or instruction of writing memoirs but rather a personal story from the authors of how they wrote their famous memoirs - silly enough this is essentially a memoir of writing memoirs.I like reading good memoirs but I found this book to be misleading and frankly a waste of time. Read Zinsser's On Writing Well - it has a chapter or two on memoirs - and save yourself time.
3,A good motivator,"A pleasant read, well written and even inspirational. A good motivator for the writer that needs to connect with other writers. I did find it helpful in terms of creating a concept of *focus* when writing a memoir. Still, if one is looking for help with craft or skill, it has its limitations."
5,Inventing the Truth: The Art and Craft of Memoir,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I mistakenly thought it was a handbook for writing a memoir but what I got was so much better. All of the authors share their inner thoughts about why they decided to create the memoirs they are known for and how they did it! Very nice ""behind the scenes"" book! I would recommend it to others for sure!"
3,Lenox tubing cutter,"Great cutter, a little locktite fixes the problem the former reviewer wrote. There is a problem with the picture, though. the 21010 is a small, handheld miniature version than what is displayed in the picture. the picture shows the 21011, which is a 1/8 to 1-3/8 cutter. research first and cross-reference before you buy."
3,Good when it works,Excellent tubing cutter with a serious problem. The screw that holds the cutter wheel in place loosens up and falls out. Rigid has a better system with pin and clip.
1,please don`t buy windows xp,it is maybe the worst windows so far my computer never stalled so much in the past not even with windows 98
1,Windows XP Home Edition - Bugs,"There are over 100 games which will no longer run or cause problems under XP and some of them are Microsoft games such as Midtown Madness II. A few others I have that don't work are Star Wars Racer, Math Blaster, Print Master Gold, Nascar 4. The workaround that Microsoft lists on this link also does not help in running these games. Overall I would rate my upgrade to XP a bust!! Good Luck with yours.(...)"
3,Hackers Break Through XP Security - Nation-wide,"After seeing the front page of my newspaper ""Hackers Break Through XP Security"", I have serious doubts about the quality of the repair patch Microsoft has released. Could it be rushed out to save embarrassment? Will it eliminate hacking? Can I trust it?And what about the government's Back Door to the operating system?"
1,Does not run Linux programs,"This might be a slick looking operating system, but I see a few problems with it:* Incompatibility with Linux means that you are locked out of literally thousands of free software programs available on that platform* Lack of source code means that if there is a problem, you depend on Microsoft to fix it. Or not. In other words, you don't have much of a sayConsider instead a purchase of Linux such as Red Hat, SuSE or Mandrake. They are available from Amazon and have neither of the limitations mentioned above."
3,Why pay to upgrade when its free?,"You can dl service pack 1 and 2 from the MS website for free. The only reason I can think of buying the CD would be if you have a slow internet connection since the dl is quite large. Id recommend upgrading one way or the other to close some of the security holes that plague XP. As a suggestion, be sure to stop your anti virus program during the install to speed things up."
4,"After a year struggling with MS ME, this was a life saver!","MICROSOFT XP HOME EDITION UPGRADE saved the life of an innocent notebook computer!!!!If you are deciding whether or not to take a sledgehammer to your Microsoft ME system, have heart!!! My husband was ready to incinerate his notebook because he thought he had bought a lemon. Well, he had bought a lemon, alright. It was not the hardware but the Operating System which came with it: THE WORST OPERATING SYSTEM KNOWN TO US COMPUTER GEEKS: MICROSOFT MILLENIUM EDITION.Ease your mind... Remove your frustrations... Just do it! Get rid of ME and install this economical upgrade!"
1,Upgrading to XP is a bad idea for Win98 users,"If you have a Windows 98 machine and it is running fine it is best to leave it alone. After upgrading to XP MANY of my programs no longer ran and required expensive upgrades to make them compatible with XP. I spent a few hundred dollars in upgrades with very little (if any) performance gain. In addition, my Intel print servers, which I purchased less than a year ago, do not and will never support XP. (FYI- do not buy Intel products if you require long term support.) So I need to purchase new print servers. After the upgrade I was rewarded with more blue screens (fatal errors) then I have ever seen with all of the previous versions of Windows combined. And this is for a standard off the rack HP machine. I can't imagine what happens to a custom built box. If you want to try the upgrade, good luck. Be prepared to send several hours getting your machine to run properly."
2,Incompatible,"Windows XP has a great new user interface, and improved multimedia capabilites, but it is just not worth the money that it would take to get everything to work with it. First, it won't recgonize your utility and antivirius software, making you buy a new one, then you have to buy an ethernet card for your cable modem, then you have to reinstall most of your programs to compete with the compatibility issues.Overall Windows XP is a good product, but it is either too advanced for the average user, or the average user is too far (5-6) months behind the times to find it useful."
4,Forget what others say!,"Other buyers of this product say it is difficult for you to install this, but for me it went smoothly. The only thing that was bad about it, is that the download is lengthy, but it's worth the wait! Improvements in all sections of Windows. The program is easier to use for both experts and beginners! The programs are set out for most commonly used to least commonly used. Which makes it a faster and easier program to deal with. This program actually improves your computer to higher speed of opening and turning of the computer. Well, that's all I have to say about this beautiful, easy to use Windows program."
1,c5,"Save your money. Buy a barebones if you need a new computer. Otherwise install ""Xtreme Pain"" on another drive. That way you can still access your hp devices, copy music CDs and use your favorite software from the 98 drive. Xp does have a prettier version of minesweeper and online checkers."
1,Can't see it,"I found Windows XP Home Edition to be quite deficient in the area of accessibility and visibility for anyone with low vision. It is much harder to find and set font sizes and colors than in Windows 98 and several options for changing the way the display looks which are available in 98 are not available at all in XP. A big negative is the loss of 640X480 screen resolution, which is a great help to visually impaired users in Windows 98. There is a built-in screen magnifier. No points there: 98 has that as well. XP looks like too much thought was given to a glitzy GUI and not enough to the needs of disabled users. Microsoft gets a big goose-egg."
5,The eXPerience has been great with Windows XP,"I'm one of the Windows Preview Program participants and have used Windows XP Beta 2, Release Candidate 1 & 2 and have been most satisfied. If you're looking for an OS with the stability and robustness of NT/2000 and the compatibility of the Windows 9x family, your wait is nearly over. Come October 25, you'll do well to upgrade to Windows XP!"
1,Irreconcilable Incompatibility Issues,"Windows XP is impossible! I just bought a new laptop, P4, running XP, unfortunately. Most of my existing software - many programs I depend on for my work - do not work with XP, not compatible. Even some popular online service software does NOT work with XP. Windows 98 and ME are far superior. With XP, I have to consider buying all new versions of software; unfortunately, many of the popular programs I use are not available in Windows XP compatible versions! There is no simple solution, but XP [stinks] majorly!"
1,incompatible with Windows 98SE,"I was disappointed to find that Windows XP is not compatble with Windows 98 SE, which makes it worthless to me. I plan to file for a refund or perhaps credit toward purchase of Windows 2000 which believe is compatible....Phil Braunpnbraun@swbell.net"
1,Acvivation scheme very obnoxious,"Microsoft has added the requirement that users do a minimal registration in order to use this or any other new MS product. This makes it so you can't move it from one computer to another and if you upgrade some of your hardware, you will have to call them and explain your story. If they don't believe you, then you won't be able to use it on your new computer. Microsoft is getting very ""nervy"" with this next generation. It's a good product, but it's nothing you couldn't get from Windows 2000 or better yet, Linux."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I reluctantly upgraded to Windows XP because certain programs I wanted to run were not supported by Windows Me, my previous OS. It's been nothing less than a disaster. I upgraded two months ago and have yet to restore the functionality I had before. I haven't had this many problems with compatability since my last girlfriend. Be warned: ""upgrade"" to XP and you're likely to find much of your hardware and software no longer works. How Microsoft became a dominant market force making garbage like this is beyond me. It's almost time for me to retire my old laptop, and I can guarantee it will be replaced by an Apple. Congratulations, Microsoft. I'm through with Windows-based PCs."
1,XP-VERY DISAPPOINTING.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Finally a good upgrade easy download,Well I'm telling everyone don't believe everything that's said about Windows-XP. I have Windows 98. I thought that I could upgrade to xp. I tried 2 times to upgrade only to be stopped right in the middle of the installing process. My computer is barely 2 years old, and I've never had trouble downloading a program, as I had trying to download this one. I know that sometimes programs freeze but I was hoping that it this one wouldn't. I wish that I could rate this a minus one. The only way this will work is if you buy a computer that has Windows XP preinstalled."
4,Good but can get better,"XP is good, but can get better. It doesn't crash, it just freezes and them comes up with a sign that says, let Microsoft know the problem and automatically sends a message to someone in cyberspace. Can you imagine millions of such messages a day hitting Renton, Washington? Forget it. They can do better and probably will."
3,Not what it's hyped up to be,"There is really no difference between Windows 2000, and Windows XP. The only thing that is different really is that XP has nicer icons and desktop. Seriously- that's all. I also experienced conflicts with my hardware on XP that I could not resolve- I didn't experience conflicts on Windows 2000 however, so be warned- XP is not compatible with all hardware. XP is good for the newbies in that it's pretty straightforward to use- sometimes annoyingly straightforward for those who are used to the Windows operating systems."
4,Very pleased with this version,Windows XP is a great improvement over older versions. The activation feature is not the hassle I feared it to be. Highly recommend this product for any new PC.
2,Undue Influence of MIS and IT foks on a Home product,"This is a technology gone bersek with needless complexity and overkill for simple home user having one computer in his study room. Administrator, pass word protection, inability to download and save files if not logged in as administrator.. the list goes on and on. Duh ? If you screwup during installation, your password for automatic log in to your ISP provider can not be fixed easily. Try editing your pass word files. Fat chance. Each time you have to delete the old wrong password and type in your correct password. So much for automatic log on. Try changing your hardware even alittle bit, you have to call microsoft to re-register your software.... You are better off with older version of the window operating systems. Atleast they left you alone once you made your purchase. Overkill and listening to the wrong users in product development indeed."
1,Windows XP Home Upgrade,Not only did this product not recognize my modem (after it auto-downloaded from Microsoft using this same modem)it couldn't install it later (even after two hours of phone assist from Microsoft) Nor would this product read either my DVD drive or my CD drive. These three items were all purchased and installed (on Millennium) in the past 12 months. I had to uninstall XP to get back my internet accessabiltity. Don't believe the hype on this product(like I did) - contact Microsoft BEFORE YOU BUY to determine if it is compatable with your current hardware or if you will be forced to replace it to meet the limitations of this product.
3,It's OKay,"It Speeds up your system, but you have to reload to many programs already on your system. Also can't reload other programs without getting upgrades because certain companies are not making drivers for thier older models. IE: certain CD burning programs........."
2,Give me Linux,"After using XP for on week, I have decided to leave MS operating systems altogether. I know the learning curve on the Linux OS will be steep for me but I am willing to deal with that, rather than deal with MS, their bugged software, and their arrogance in taking for granted that all customers will copy their software. I don't like having to get their permission to add peripherals or to re-install the system. I say it's time for people to make a thoughtful decision to not depend on MS's arrogance any longer."
3,Compatability Problems,"Having been a diehard windows fan for some years I was surprised by all the compatability issues that poped up durring my installation of XP. An avid gamer who still luvs to play some of the older games bouncing around out there will want to stay away from xp till they get these problems solved.The new GUI system is top notch and is much more stable then anything else so far released even at peak refresh rates there is no texure tearing in most games, and the load time, though not that much faster is noticiable so.As for all the bells and whistles can say much about them as I toned down xp on install so as not to get as many conflicts and save hard staroge for other programs.All in all if you game alot wait on this one if ya just want a faster home pc this would be the program for you.My system specs:Atholon 18001.5gig ddrGeforce 3 ddr pro 64megFast anyways I do have a noticable upgrade with XP as 98 couldn't keep up with my system and was slowing it down."
2,Problems installing older products,"I don't seem to have to many problems with XP, until i tried to install my HP desktop 960c printer and my, Hp scanjet 5300c. I had to go to HP's website just to download the software because the software that comes with the products is not XP verified. I do get serious errors alor on certain websites or playing certain games. I get a midi error and causes the system to shutdown and reboot by itsself. I tried to install XP updates and it crashed my system, changed programs and Word 2002 it changed some of the saved files to unreadable, ended up doing a system restore to get it out. System Restore is suppose to return the system to its last saved state, but it doesn't always delete the stuff installed that is screwing up the system. It also restores folders that i had deleted with nothing in them. XP uses alot of ram, i run 512 dd ram on a p4 2.o it alwasy uses at least 55% of ram even when i am not using the computer."
4,"Older systems need not apply, but if you have the hardware..","I've been running BETA versions for some time now, and am quite impressed. My hardware is fairly stock stuff, and XP has had no problems. Very stable (even earlier BETA versions), and relatively fast, if you have the hardware. I started using it on a PII 333MHz system with 128MB of RAM. Pretty pokey, especially when compared to Win98SE. But... Now that I've upgraded to a Duron 850 with 256MB of RAM, it runs quite nicely. I have a dual-boot between 98SE and XP. Once XP officially ships, though, I'll drop 98SE (not that I've even booted to SE in quite a while, mind you). Great support for home systems with multiple users, easy to use and very stable. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I think Microsoft has a winner here."
1,"XP Home a ""Bust"" for the Buck","I tried XP Home on a desktop for over a year and it was nothing but headaches. A laptop running XP Pro in the same period, used the same amount of usage had less than a third of the problems. Shell out the additional for XP Pro or don't waste your money, XP Home is garbage."
3,I liked it and I didn't,"I liked the colors and the graphics. I found it seemed a little slower than Windows ME and Second Edition. I found that I can't run XP without having to replace my printer, scanner and my dial-up modem because they were not compatible with XP. My computer is a year old and I have wasted $... on an upgrade that I can't use.I am disappointed with software manufacturers for letting people buy these products knowing they will not be compatible with our computers trying to force us to go out and buy a new system.I for one have spent a lot of money for my system and will not buy another one until they figure out how to upgrade my printer, scanner and dial-up modem without costing hundreds of dollars in upgrade costs and of course I cannot return my XP to the store I bought it from because it has been opened and Microsoft cheated another customer and in the process making themselves look even worse than they do now. Makes me want to sue them for the hundred bucks I've wasted."
1,The great disappointment,"After installing XP, I got a number of messages stating that XP was not compatible with a number of applications. For some I had to go to the net to get patches from the manufacturer. Others (Corel WP office suite 7) required that I fork out for an upgrade. Even with the ""compatible"" programs there were continual interuptive messages that something went wrong and that message would be sent to MSFT. I feel that I bought a beta version of something.I uninstalled XP and went back to 98...creating more problems.Thanks for nothing, Microsoft!"
3,eXtraProblems!,"Once again, an OS from Microsoft is released too early. I did my homework and ran Microsoft's Upgrade Advisor. It informed me that my soundcard would need to be upgraded, and two programs would need to be reinstalled. not thinking this was a problem, I went ahead with installation. Well, my monitor was not recognized, reducing it to Plug and Play. Updated drivers did nothing to help. My video card was not ""Logo certified"", so those drivers did not work either. Too make a long story short, some 6 hours later, Win98SE found it's way back on to my computer. Don't buy this upgrade unless it comes preconfigured on your machine. You will save yourself time, money, and patience."
1,MicroCrap,"I have used DOS, Win3.1, Win95, Win98 and now this piece of crap OS. Microsoft's only interest is making money, thats why they come out with a new release of an OS upon a new release of an OS. Each one just as buggy, insecure and unstable as the previous version.Anything coming from Microsoft just plain sucks.I have now switched from InterCrap explorer to Mozilla and from Out-Crash-express to Thunderbird, soon I will completely switch to Linux, a FAR better and FUNCTIONAL OS for a far better price, namely free. My next laptop will be a Mac.Dont waste your money, Microsoft designed software is garbage by definition. And for the person saying he can understand we are not all geeks : I shouldnt HAVE to be a frigging geek to use an OS"
1,XP=eXpect Pain,Let me say that Windows ME was great with backwords compatibility. XP is better right? WRONG! This OS is very random on what it will run! Even on programs that say they work on XP! The reason? Mainly because security updates will mess up a lot of them. Also with old programs it won't run well in the first place. ALSO even with all the security updates XP is very vulnerable. If you plan to get a new computer and want to use DSL I heard Macs are very good. Also people who use older OSes will have to learn how to do stuff again. Another problem is that XP is a BIG HOG OF RAM! If you can find one get ME. XP is bad espiaclly for DSL!
1,Windows 98 Users Beware,"The CompUSA sales representative who sold me the upgrade told me that upgrading from Windows 98 to XP was a simple upgrade. That statement was not true. Before the computer would even installed it, I recieved three pages of warnings about both hardware and software incompatibilities. Of course the store manager would not give me a refund. He stated that they had sold hundreds of XP upgrades without a single complaint. Since I purchased the upgrade, everyone that I have spoken to about the upgrade from 98 to XP told me not to do it due to the problems that users encounter."
1,eXPerience the pain,"Microsoft has made a great line of operating systems greater, they advertise. They should have put down ""Helpful new bugs to increase your productivity"" on the features list. Microsoft is well-known for its security failures, but Windows XP is the worst. There are critical updates every week in Windows Update, making me wonder about my security. There was an update last week that corrected a problem about a security hole in Internet Explorer. They may keep correcting the bugs, but wouldn't it be better to make it with no bugs in the first place? I will be switching to a Mac or Linux."
1,MSXP Undeveloped,"On a recent computer upgrade, I Purchased Windows XP. My ISP, CD burner,printer and scanner needed to have upgrades and patches to allow them to work.(They still have problems.)The system looks great and within it's self works fine, just don't try to operate something else with it.I'm going back to ""98se""."
1,buyer beware,"Everything i have tried to install in my new computer (new DVD drive, new ATI video card, spiderman video game) says that XP is incompatible and need vendor drivers. Have downloaded drivers only to be told again that they are incompatible. System has crashed innumerable times, had to mail away for recovery discs etc. All my friends have had similiar experiance. I suspect there is a another MS scandle brewing involving ""who gets to be MS compatible"" so they can keep their monopoly on home computing products. Meanwhile, the consumer is once again disenfranchised. Don't fall for it- use win98 until they get this garbage fixed."
1,Bad News,"I purchased XP as an upgrade to Windows 98 SE and had nothing but trouble in trying to get the bulk of my hardware to work with it. Either the drivers or the software for my Lexmark 5770 printer, Acer flatbed scanner, Viking Components USB Flash Memory Reader, Race Leader Force Feedback Game Controller and Satellite USB Modem all were incompatible with XP. These are all relatively new pieces of hardware, the oldest purchased new about 18 months ago. I was able to get a few of these devices to work with XP (after a considerable amount of effort), but others would not operate at all. My guess is that when all the drivers are made to be compatible with XP that the operating system will work smoothly, but I'm back to using my previous operating system for now. I wish that Microsoft was more forthcoming with information about the difficulty one may have with hardware and software compatibility before I purchased this operating system. I might not have wasted my money."
5,I love XP!,My fiance and mom both aren't comfortable with Windows XP and I've heard tons of horror stories about bugs and incompatibility. But from the day I opened XP I was hooked! A much more attractive look and a very user-friedly interface.
3,Don't upgrade to Home if you connect to a Windows domain,I upgraded my Win98 PC to XP Home and it's been pretty crash proof and works well so far. The biggest pain is not having Domains in the Home Edition. I have a work laptop that has Win2K and a corporate domain and I was able to file share before with it in Win98 -- now I can't -- you need XP Pro and MSFT won't credit you for the [cost of] XP Home -- so you could end up paying [nearly tripple] if you need the so-called Oops upgrade. Just skip XP Home and go for XP Pro if you need to file share w/ another PC. Another annoyance is all the MSFT popups when you pop a CD in or hook up a digital camera via USB.
4,Pretty good....,"I've had Windows XP for a year now and it's probably the best OS that Microsoft has put out so far. The major difference in this version compared to it's predecessors is the new interface. At first, I was skeptical of the new design because it looked a little too user-friendly for my liking but I got used to it quickly. The colors are vibrant and they make a difference in the attraction of this product.This operating system is much more stable than the other versions, too. Windows Me was the first OS that I ever used but I always felt that it left much to be desired. The stability was bad, the omnipresent blue screen of death (if you've had Me, you'll know what I am talking about) came up often, and it seemed so much like a Windows 98 3rd Edition instead of Me after I tried out 98. Fortunately, This blue screen of death is absent from this version. Compared to the other versions, this is like a Godsend.If you are sick of unstability or just want to upgrade, go for this product."
4,impressed,"I hadn't heard anything about XP prior to using it. Little Ole' me was satisfied with Win98-2nd Ed. XP came preinstalled on my new P4 and its a whole new experience. I'm very surprised.Downside is that one gets very used to the &#%backward Win98 system and may have to actually take the XP Tour and Tutorial to even realize how dark ages Win98 really was. I did. Another downside is compatibility. Since most software packages, games and input devices haven't been completely tested as XP compatible, you'll either have to ingnore compatibility issues (this seems to work) or wait for your software to be upgraded."
1,could be better!,"XP is one of the worst investments I've made. It eats up memory badly, frustrating to install, and you have to reformat some of your currently loaded programs, and some of your programs may not even run again. I want '98 back. DEFINITELY NOT MADE FOR LAPTOPS! Plus, if you want assistance from Microsoft, you have to pay $... and it's hard to get assistance in the first place."
4,Completely blows 98SE away!,"I bought Windows XP at the recommendation of a friend. (I have a P3 800 MHz with 256 MB RAM). The installation went without a hitch, once I did some research and downloaded all the updated drivers. Now my computer was ready for XP, or so I thought. The only problem was XP wouldn't recognize my scanner or TV card. Not a problem. I bought I new (even better) scanner. I've yet to buy a TV card. I'm gonna wait and see if any new drivers are released first. So far, I've only had one crash on XP. Other than that, my system has been working even better than 98SE!"
2,"Ok, but the hidden facts you may not know","One thing I saw on a tech report on XP was that all the software that comes with it, could be considered a demo. While you don;t have to pay extra for it, you are only getting a taste of the software. You don't get the full version. Also I am not going to buy this, because i saw a friend's computer that had, it, and i don't think it is worth 200 dollars to upgrad3e my house. My suggestion, Wait a year or two, till they work out any bugs, and then the price will most likely drop a lot. Look at the price of windows 98 when it came out, and a year ago!"
2,looks like i'll be running 2000 for a lot longer,"after playing with XP, there are two things that really irk me.1. the amount of ram this thing requires. are the extra bells and whistles really worth it? why does windows have to become an even bigger ram hog?2. the code thing you have to get from MS. i fear this may be a big mess, especially for people who like to add and fiddle with their machines."
1,Absolute proof that Microsoft has a monopoly on op systems,"Unreliable, mediocre, untested, and highly annoying. I have had constant problems running software on XP. Quite often the XP updates make some software stop functioning. Using XP makes me wish I had a Mac. This is an incredibly lighweight software. My pc came with XP; but if you're looking to upgrade --- PLEASE DON'T."
4,Mixed bag,"Upgraded from ME. Major problems encountered include clock setting at 15320 (instead of 2002)-outlook not letting you open certain hyperlinks(the kind for example in a newspaper which lets you link to an article-does let you connect with url's.) And the biggest problem is getting an HP 6300 Scanner to work. Nothing HP has lets the scanner connection survive past the first reboot. Tried all the tricks they sent, the XP software, and the patch put 5/30/2002 that is supposed to fix this problem. HP needs to get it together and fix this. Scanner still works on my other ME system. Finally, it does not seem to like to start other users and run DSL-only likes the first one put in. Other that that, I like-very smooth."
2,Windows XP Pro is better.,"I do a lot of upgrades, and build my own PC's. XP Pro is one of the best and stable OS's I have ever used."
1,30 days and counting,"OK. XP would get four stars from me, if it weren't for the Activation Code issue. I didn't think Product Activation was bad until I read the fine print. I get 30 days. That's for the life of the product. If you use 20 days at the start, and in six months you add some hardware, you now only have ten days left (The clock does not restart). Once the 30 days is used XP is disabled every time three things are changed on the computer. Extra RAM and a new processor (counts as two) and I need a new code. I don't think this is going to help the piracy issue, but it looks like it will be a big pain for the rest of us. Stick with Win98 or ME."
1,Eats up ram and crashes all the time,I just bought a Dell Inspiron 8200 pre-installed with Windows XP home edition and it [isn't very good]! the system keeps crashing and the problems are endless. I have another Dell system with Win 2K and boy is it A LOT better!... I am actually thinking about uninstalling the XP and installing Win 2K instead!!Also the XP is very demanding on RAM. I have 128MB of RAM and my system keeps running out of RAM and Virtual memory. Despite the fact that I only use IE and Word most of the time. The Win2K PC is not even half the specs of my new laptop but still works faster and smoother!
1,Activation Scheme: Bad Move,"Like some of the other posters have said, I feel that this is a good OS ruined by a bad activation scheme. I live in a house with 5 computers. Myself and my sister (who each have a desktop and a laptop), and my folks who have a desktop. In order for us to upgrade to XP (legally), we'll have to buy 5 copies of Win XP. That's ridiculous.Cracks are already appearing to circumvent this activation scheme, and I think, ironically, that in its attempt to discourage piracy, Microsoft will usher in a new generation of pirates. I'm not talking about the hardcore guys who already do it....I'm talking about the casual user like my parents who will say ""I'm not paying for each system's OS...how do I get around it."" And *BOOM*....they find out how easy it is...and they never buy software again.Nice work, M$. Anyway, I will probably purchase a copy...but I will use it for all 5 of my systems...hence my rating...1 outta 5 ;)"
1,Dumbed down Windows,"We got our hands on a WinXP Pro demo.The interface is nice, albeit a poor imitation of the OS X desktop. It feels like MS designed this for computer newbies but has made it more difficult for people who already know they're way around. The menus have also become so cluttered in the process.Power users would probably turn off the Luna interface after the initial novelty wears off to make it really efficient for work. In which case, it offers no significant upgrade to Windows 2000 uers."
2,pretty good but....,"i use my computer for mostly games and also for typeing college papers. i dont know all of the techinical details about the product so i am gonna keep it simple. for the most part there is a big improvement from the privious versions. but i own about 50 or more PC games and when i upgraded, about all of them aren't compatible! 50 games is alot of money when your a college student! now all of my games are useless. when microsoft came out with the windows 98 upgrade all of my windows 95 games worked great. now they are useless. besides the fact of games and other programs not being compatible with it, it is a very nice program. If you are not a gamer this is highly recomended. If you are a gamer stick with windows 98, and/or windows ME."
2,Not very good,"This is the second-to-worst operating system I've used. It's almost worse than Mac OS 9. Anyway, this doesn't really have many pros or cons. Sometimes you really like the operating system, and sometimes you want to throw your computer out the window. Microsoft really messed up.Pros:-The computer will tell you when updates are avaible-Most games are compatible-Good amount of card games to playCons:-Doesn't work well with wireless internet-Freezes frquently-WordPerfect can drive you insane-Takes a while to start up-Saving pages on the internet doesn't workOverall, Windows XP isn't very good. You're better off with Windows 2000."
1,Stick To ME or 98,ALright I Have Always Been a Fan Of Microsoft And There ProductsI Have Two Computers One Is Running Windows ME The Other One Windows 98 now i tried to install windows xp on my computer that is running windows me and it threw up all kinds of errors like cab file errors all kinds of errors blue windows after i finally got it to install it ran real slow and crashed all the time my computer is a 700mgh 128mb ram computer ok it shouldn't have been slow after a few days im back running windows me and a few days later i tried to install it on my computer with windows 98 and the same thing happened
3,"Windows XP- Better than Me, but what isn't..","It seems every now and again, Microsoft needs more money, so it puts out a new OS. While XP may have it's strong points, decent looking, start menu is better, it really isn't a ""must have"". For anyone who is doing just fine with what ever you have, there is no reason to get this. Other than to waste money, that is. Yet, if your looking for a little bit more, and have some spare $$$, then this is for you. XP should be called Windows Starter, as this is really best for people who don't know too much about computers. If this decribes you, then XP is your new friend. You will probably be able to do things, you don't know how to before. Wizards and a better help center can guide you through all most all the problems you might face. Plus, as AOL would say, it is very simple to use. So once you get past that activation nonsense, you feel right at home with this update."
1,The new Micro$oft scam.,"Can you imagine buying a CD for your stereo, and then finding out that when you want to use it in your car you have to call the company for permission? Only to have them inform you that for your car you'll have to buy an entirely new CD?This is XP. After you pay good money and get the thing, you still have to ask Micrs ""can I use it please?"" and if u ask too often, they'll tell you to fork over more cash. It's an insult - not only geared tword computer rookie's wowed by good looking useless things, it prohibits the experienced from constantly upgrading, and handcuffs users with it's copyright protection nonsense.This one's right out of the Monte Burns school of software. I can hear BGates now...Excellant!"
3,Be an Expert or Know One...,"Wow... a week of torture with XP. I've been building computers for 5 years now and by far this install of the upgrade version was the toughest. Needless to say, it took 3 days to get it to work right and still many programs and hardware items are not yet compatible. Your Easy CD Creator will not work, many HP Officejets ...and a lot of games just won't cut it.Once it is going, however, it's a great product! But oh that upgrading..."
1,"Terrible, in the extreme!","Simply put, this program is NOT as advertised. This is NOT one of those programs where you just load it, and it works, ""automatically"". No, in order to use this software, your computer MUST be plugged into the internet.The software will NOT even load, until it verifies an internet connection. I know, I TRIED loading this O.S. about 20 times, before I stumbled upon the section, where it says ""Check for internet connection"". When I ckecked this, knowing I had no connection, the program told me it would NOT load, until I HAD a connection.I swear to GOD this is true. I am NO computer geek, but, with GOD as my witness, my computer said this program would NOT load until I was internet connected."
1,Be Aware Be Very Aware,"I recently bought this upgrade for my home computer , loaded it up, got the other upgrades I needed for the dvd player and burner , scanner another 100 or so dollars. Then today I decide to put it on my daughters computer but I find out that you can only use it on one computer , I called Microsoft and they actually want you to BUY another XP upgrade, I was livid , lots of screaming but to no avail , so needless to say my daughter is still using ME editon. I refuse to give Gates another dime.HE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED MY NEXT COMPUTER WILL BE AN APPLE"
1,An issue of trust,"Hi:Disgusted with my recent experience with running MS Combat Flight Simulator 3, I hoped to improve my experience with an ""UPGRADE"". I wrongly imagined that Microsoft had seen the light and improved it's attitude toward the (""customer"")... offering a real product for a change , I know ... it was silly of me.My first step was to read customer reviews, my next step is to forget it.Recently, I wrote a customer review in which I stated that after many years of experience with Windows I have learned to distrust MS; I repair that statement here by stating that MS has taught me to distrust them.Hard work is noble, unless that hard work is against the customer then it is not noble.The customer in this computer industry is called a ""USER"", I believe it would be more honest to call him/her the used.Disgruntled, but sincere.John King AKA jhnkij@AOL.com"
2,XP or bust?,"Try before you buy Is what I say..I have windows ME, but wont be upgrading for a long time I think well unless the next upgrade is better than this one.My parents have XP on theirs and it is terrible!come on Microsoft, are you really that desperate for MORE money??"
1,Whats on the Inside?,"Although the hype-up that Microsoft has given its operating system windows xp was huge, I think windows ME has so much more to offer.For one thing, XP is a control freak - by this I mean it will not let you install drivers for example if they have not been approved by MICROSOFT QUALITY STANDARDS. ...the drivers I tried to install came with the hardware!!I have found XP to be prone to crashes, and being a moderately experienced computer programmer and security expert, I have found many many flaws in its user interface.If you want a top-quality product, choose windows ME."
3,More windoze...,"Microsoft tries yet again, but still cannot match the ease or power of the MacOs. And when will they learn to put disk icons on the desktop?"
4,Time upgrade,For all those who complain about having programs not work under XP can stay with old (...) versions of windows and stil have their old programs- their old programs that shut down randomly and cause the infamous BSOD. (...). Time to realize the Future.
2,Bad Performance,"When I first heard of Windows XP, I assumed it would be a memory hog, and I was right. Most of my software programs that I had installed before XP run unusually slow. I have to constantly restart my PC. XP has high graphic expectations also. About the only good things that come with XP are the new desktop themes, and some cool features. I would also not recommend this PC to all you gamers and big-time memory users out there."
3,Not as incredible as they make you think..,"XP works good after you finally make it work.. It must be good on a NEW computer, but if you buy this upgrade, it will practicly eliminate all your programs, and make it hard to find your files.. You cannot use a webphone and you have to reinstall most of your programs.. besides the down side, you have some stuff thats alot better, especially multimedia stuff like video and audio.. It is ok, but not totally compatible.. Not even by downloading special drivers for your old hardware such as scanners, cameras, etc.."
5,The best OS Microsoft ever made to date,"I really love this OS.After having used Win98SE for over 1,5 year I'm so happy with this since it came on the market in october 2001 !!I'm running my network 24/7 and all computers use the XP-home version with the LINKSYS cable router.At first (with W98SE) the systems crashed more and more frequently after being online.Where it began with one time a day, it ended with one time every hour...No problems with XP though!! It just keeps running on all our computers 24/7 ever since Oct.2001Absolutely RECCOMMANDED !!"
2,product activation annoyance,"there's the annoyance...apart from that a good OS...never crashes, rarely gets unstable. New media player doesn't like MP3's downloaded from the web (a piracy measure it seems)...Okay for home use...absolutely useless in a workplace.Suggestion: buy XP pro if you must have windows... Or download Mandrake LINUX...:) for free..."
1,Too Much hassle,"Microsoft Windows XP doesn't offer a significant increase in value over it's predecessors. It is somewhat more stable, yes, but the trouble you will have to go to to ""upgrade"" is not worth it. The need for above-average computing power means that only people with relatively new machines (no more an about a year and a half old) will be able to really use it. As well, the fact that you need to re-register with microsoft every time you make a little change in your hardware configuration is a rediculous problem.All in all, unless you have a new machine, have the time to waste going through Microsoft's upgrade procedure, and enjoy having to jump through hoops to let Microsoft know when you change your computer's hardware configuration, avoid this ""new"" operating system."
2,XP only ME dressed up,"Since buying the upgrade of windows XP i have had to reinstallit 3 times -onto a clean hard disk- The first time it just disappeared and turned into a blue screen,with messages that hive files were gone missing? 2nd time round the registery gotcorrupted and the last time it refused to boot,and not wantingto have to trall through another install i used the XP CD to try the recovery consol. This was as much use as a cigarettelighter on a motor bike. None of the commands worked,and even trying the help file was useless. There seems to be a seriousproblem with system restore in XP, and im fully updated with all the latest SPacks,and stacks of space on my hard disk alotted to SR! Check dates will disappear and when you really need ST to get you back and running -it goes pear shaped! I now running 3 restored version of XP completly backed up on a seperate hard disk using Power Quests Drive image.My experences with XP are ITS NOT RELIABLE.."
2,Not worth the trouble,"I upgraded to XP and had the same problems that everyone else did with hardware. I totally lost my modem and had to uninstall every time I wanted to connect to the Microsoft site to get help on upgrading from Windows ME. Luckily I bought XP at Home Depot and they let me return the opened box without a question. I spent two days on the phone with Microsoft and on all of hardware vendor internet sites looking for help.After much frustration, I decided it was not worth the trouble. One note of CAUTION! Since I had uninstalled and re-installed so many programs to try to get things working, I was glad to have the RESTORE utility on ME so I could return to my previous configurations. I was shocked to find that XP had erased all of my RESTORE dates. Be careful what you do to your old OS because if you go back to it, you may have to spend some time trying to get it back to what you had before the upgrade."
3,"Not 100% sold, yet!","Let me begin by describing my computer set-up. Athlon 1.0 processor, 356 meg RAM, etc.I installed XP last evening on my computer, and have spent a lot of time since then downloading upgrades for my computer. Adaptec Easy CD Creator 4.0 does not run with XP. You can purchase AECC 5.0 for $(dollar amount), but even then you have to wait for the free download of 5.1 (not yet available) before you can use your burner. I use my burner daily and was not ready for such a delay. Other than that, this edition is fine. The visual package is pleasing, very user-friendly and more organized than ME or 98.Time will tell more for me, but I am not sure that the upgrade is worth it. Buy a machine designed especially designed for XP. Windows ME was fine for me, and you might find the same true for you."
1,Fails on Virgin Hardware,I have loaded this junk several times on a new Intel 1.6 pentium 4 board with a brand new hard drive. It only reboots with the original installation. Download Windows upgrade and it fails to reboot. Norton 2002 Suite installs and then XP fails the reboot. What's wrong with this picture? (...) It hasn't been this bad sice the upgrade from DOS 5 to 6. Maybe I should have gone Apple.
4,Very Good,"If you want to stay updated, this is a nice product to get.Although, I predict there will be errors when you try to upgrade it. You will probaly have to reformat your system, then install your orgianl windows verison then windows xp. that is what i was forced to do, because windows ME made errors like crazy.I think that this will be a succesfull product, it's worththe reformat."
5,Best operating system yet,"This upgrade is absolutely worth the money. XP is far more stable than its predecessors, and boots up very quickly. One of its best features is the file and transfer wizard which makes upgrading to a new PC a snap. Another great feature is auto update which makes sure you've got all the patches and new versions as they are released."
4,Very stable and great new look!,"I think Windows XP is the best operating system yet. I got it, installed it, and it worked right away! I love the new look too. Windows XP has never crashed where I have had to restart the computer either... Very stable! Great job Microsoft!"
1,What a piece of junk!,"After installing it, I discovered that there are no compatible drivers for my printer and for my video card. So now I'm stuck with a computer running a brand new OS that only lets me view the screen in 640x480 and 16 colors.What a disaster!"
2,Things to watch for,"XP is a solid step forward but I feel the need to inform people of something I'm already coming across. If you do not have internet then XP is not for you. While you can dial the 1-800 number to activate xp, it is troublesome. I have in actualiy lived in places that do not have regular phone service, and in a location like that I could not load XP! Now I realize i'm a minority in the Big Money Game (tm) but it irks me as a computer tech to have YET ANOTHER THING TO FIX FROM MICROSOFT!"
1,XP Disappointment,"I ordered the XP home edition upgrade thinking that it would solve some of the system lockup problem(s) I was experencing, it only created additional problems. I loaded XP on my SONY PCG-FX215 notebook only to find that, at the end of the 72 min. install, it couldn't find the Conexant-Ambit SoftK56 Data, Fax Modem that came preinstalled in the notebook. It's frustrating to think that the only way I can use XP is to install an NEW modem. The notebook itself is only months old...I wish I could rate this product lower than 1 star."
1,Windows XP Home edition,"This is the worst windows program so far. What they don't say is that it won't support many scanners (TWAIN), other hardware and software. All in one print/scan/copy etc. units only partly work and the manufactures will not offer software upgrades. In order to not replace my equipment, I had to revert back to Windows 98. It seems almost like a scheme on the part of Microsoft to disble outside drivers like TWAIN making the systems obsolete. It looks cool, but having to do patches on most programs is a waste of time and money."
3,Nice storm until the end of the CD,Overall the beginning is great with an authentic sounding thunderstorm until you get to the last tracks of the CD. They are all just single thunderclaps one after the other which is hard to listen or relax to. Overall I think the echos of nature storm CD was more of what I was looking for.
3,The storm plus,"This begins with 60 minutes of a thunder storm. Then there 24 thunderclaps lasting from 20 to 40 seconds, fade out, silence, next thunder clap. The second part is like a sound effects recording rather than a continuous storm. The only thing I didn't like was that if I listen to it to go to sleep the second part wakes me up."
2,Sound Effects CD,"This is more a CD for a Sound Library - if you look for sound effects this might be a good choice but it's not a CD you want to listen to. The pieces are short and don't flow with eachother very well...I would recommend other ""Thunderstorm"" CDs that are more for audio listening pleasure. For example:Sounds of Nature - Thunderstorm (Thunderstorm & Rain)"
3,THUNDERSTORM CD FROM AMAZON,This CD was for my dog who is afraid of thunderstorms. It was going to be adversion therapy. I feel it is not loud enough. But I guess most people buy it for humans to listen to and relax. It is good but not loud enough for what I wanted.
4,Not sure how well it work since I've got no bugs to test it out.,"I bought this way back but haven't even used it. I was having fly problems, but by the time the product came, the flies were gone and now I moved out of the place already. I still have it, but have yet to use it. I don't think I paid too much for it."
3,Chipping in the Desert,"Things to know about this product:1)It is neoprene so it is very light.2) The tee does not hold up against novice golfers(Last about 3 shots)3) Moves very easily because of its weight.4) Worth the sub $20 or so I paid.I had a simple problem, no grass to drive and chip off of in Afghanistan. Amazon had a simple solution, a sub $20 mat with integrated tee. This product is worth every penny I paid for it. I would recommend this product to any Deployed service member that needs a little green to play."
2,"LOVELY, BUT LEAKS","The fountain was lovely to look at, but the upper bowl that recieves the water from the lion's mouth was different than the one pictured here. A design flaw exists in that as the water leaves the upper bowl, it does not only drip straight down, it flows over the rim and down the sides of the bowl. It then runs along the seam where the top portion of the fountain connects to the base, and leaks down the back of the fountain. I came outside to find that it had pumped itself almost dry and my deck was soaked. I took it apart and put it together again, but there was no change. If the top portion had a slight overhang, the problem would be solved."
3,"Pretty decent soundtrack, captures the film","The soundtrack for the movie ""Clueless"" captures the film. When you hear the song ""Rolling With My Homies,"" you remember the house party. It's a fairly decent soundtrack. I like the song ""Supermodel"" and everytime I hear it I think about Tai's makeover. It's seriously lacking some major bookends. When CHer first takes off in her vehicle at the beginning of the film she is listening to ""Just A Girl,"" by No Doubt before they got huge. Another song missing is ""Tenderness"" by General Public when was played at the end of the wedding and during the pink screen credits. Who knows why those songs were omitted but they aren't here. What you are left with is a pretty decent soundrack but not something that really stands the test of time like say the ""Valley Girl"" soundtrack ya know? A few good songs and some forgettable songs, and groups. Whatever happened to The Muffs?"
4,Very good but missing some music,"I like the soundtrack but there were some music in the movie that was missing in the soundtrack (ie""Tenderness"", ""All by Myself"" etc.). But overall, the sound track is still enjoyable"
3,Mostly good,"This soundtrack is mostly good, though some songs from the show aren't on here. Still, over all it's reminiscent of the film."
3,A good sound track but the best songs always get left out,"This sound track is an exerlent companion to the film with some pretty grovie tracks. My only complant is the song ""All by my Self"" by Jewel does not apear on this CD, this is the only film I have ever heard Jewel cover this song and yet they left it off the CD ... bummer ..."
3,Needs a volume two,Great movie but there is still a lot of songs missing of the first movie soundtrack let's hope that there will be a second movie soundtrack for CLueLess with all the missing songs on it.
2,Tenderness,"I completely agree with the other reviewer. The whole reason I came here was to find the final track that plays in the movie (""Tendernes"") and was surprised not to find it in the compliation!"
4,"As soundtracks go, this one rocks","I'm an avid reader of Amazon's CD reviews but have never felt the need to write one.. until now. C'mon people, this is a great CD. At the very least, it's the only released recording of Velocity Girl's ""My Forgotten Favorite,"" which doesn't seem to appear in the movie but is nonetheless (honestly) one of the greatest songs ever recorded. On top of that you have great tracks by Radiohead, Counting Crows and Beastie Boys, and fun punkish tunes like ""Where'd You Go?"" and ""Supermodel"" and ""Need You Around"". No, it's not perfect, and it's missing some good songs from the movie (which are probably more worthy of inclusion) but it's worth owning nonetheless. At least 4 stars."
3,Not fully clueless,"I bought the sound track after watching the movie and have to say i was slightly disapointed, there are songs in the movie that are not on the sound track and unfortunatley it is the better songs that are missing. Although there are four songs on the cd that i do like so im happy, this is great to listen to if your feeling down because youll be brought streight back up again."
1,A clueless soundtrack,"this cd is a waste.their is nothing good on it.the soundtrack has arist i never heard of: the muffs,supergrass,cracker,smoking popes???? who are they? the other ones i heard of were:jill soulbe and coolio.i would not buy this at all.nope."
4,Sonic pleasure,"Beautifully recorded disc in a vein similar to Deep Forest. I don't like labels very much so I would hesitate to say that it is ""New Age"", although someone who likes ""New Age"" might very well enjoy it. One of the facets I like most about this recording is the creative synthesizer work -- bold tones and surprising counterpoints to the main melody abound.I drive to and from work listening to this CD on a regular basis. I often put it on in the background when dinner guests are present and they always pull me aside and say, ""Who is this?"".I am sad to see that this wonderful CD is currently unavailable. I know of at least 3 people who would like to own it.Update: As of 5/14/2003 I see that this gem is now available again. I plan to buy several copies as gifts for friends and family who heard it at my home (and could not find copies). Don't miss your chance to buy this sonic beauty."
5,"Mesmerizing, haunting sound",Skillful interweaving of traditional vocal sounds with mesmerizing sample & electronic tracks. This lives in my CD player for weeks at a time. I want more!
5,Mosby Textbook for Nursing Assistants,Item is a textbook - it had good images and instruction. The information was current and it was helpful when caring for my mom at home.
3,HOW ABOUT A STANDARD AC ADAPTER ?? WHAT ABOUT ALL TV CHANNELS,"with HDTV broadcast coming soon this will not receive the TV band. Not that I use it much, it only has VHF, no UHF. I live in hell AKA Atlanta, GA, most stations are UFH. Now in NY it would work better, till 02/2009.Sony does not include an AC adapter, wants to suck a few extra bucks out of you. The shipping cost for the extra unit is what disappoints me as well as finding it.The unit does work well with MP3's. My AC unit died so I am using this every day, for about a year, but changing batteries is a pain.For workouts get an Ipod, as this unit is to big to be considered portable as are all Cd units today.All pictures used for display do not show the handle on the other side. It is much larger than pictured. It has a carrying handle with all the controls which makes it twice as large.All stores should show both sides so the customer KNOWS what they are buying.I give it a 3 because I now am using it. When I first got it I never used it."
2,"Nice player, but no remote - and a NON-REMOVABLE hand grip","While it's seemingly a very good player, it's useless without a remote esp. if you plan to backpack it, weightlift or jog with it.The handle should be removable - I was going to unscrew it, but you can't since the radio and navigation is built into the handle.A good player overall, but the handle and lack of remote render this player wanting. Wait until the next release of new discmans if can if your deciding on this one."
3,Outdated ATRAC3,"Sony no longer makes or supports ATRAC3. So, why are you buying this equipment? The sports version was a good idea. If Sony sells this for 50 dollars, ok."
2,"Sony S2 Range, disjointed product planning....","The current S2 Sports CD players have those fragile little controls (that's a handle?). The model(s) replaced had a tough little joy strap and a durable, adjustable wrist strap. For all the minor improvements on the inside, the control and carrying arrangements where a great leap backward... only proving that Sony embraces planned obsolesence.My S2 (D-SJ301) only just required adjustment as it reaches ten (10!) years of age. One simply doesn't sell very many replacements for a product that doesn't break.Sony D-SJ301 S2 Sports CD Walkman"
4,Hard to Open,"I liked this cd but I had to buy another one because it was too hard to open. YOu have to make sure it is directly line up with the arrow or it will not play the radio or the cd. I just went ahead and bought myself a less complicated sony. Otherwise it is okay. Oh yes, it didn't have a bass boost. So you know for me it had to go."
1,CD Player,Where is my CD player. I have tried to contact seller but no response. I have submitted claim to Amazon.
5,Operates faultlessly,"This player takes CDs, including CD-Rs and CD-RWs with 20+ hours of mp3 on them, in stride. It plays them through, and does fast forward and rewind about as well as my solid-state mp3 player. Utilizing CD-RWs, I use this unit instead of a juke box. I still use my solid-state mp3 player only because it is more compact than this unit. As I prefer having TV audio available, no other player/receiver would have entirely satisfied me. The impressive technical accomplishment of this product will cause me to favor Sony products in future.The exterior design does leave things to be desired. The control buttons are cheesy and hard to operate. The display is too small. Instead of a carrying case or an anchor for a strap, there is a stupidly designed protruding flexible handle that makes the unit twice as bulky as it needs to be."
3,Radio Works .. CD's and MP3's thats another story!,I gave this as a gift for my friend who dosn't speak english. a bi-lingual manual would've been helpful. He tells me that the top dosn't always stay closed and it doesn't read his cd's or mp3's. but after reading someone elses review i now know i have to tell him to wait about 10 minuites for the cd to be read. I have been to sony.com and can not find this product on their site. discontinued? I wonder why?
2,Can only be held by hand,"I did not see anywhere when I bought this product that it only fits on the back of my hand. It is very cumbersome and hard touse, constantly in the way. I truly do not like it at all and would not recommend it to anyone unless they never move their hands."
5,I was and still am so impressed,Wow.This book even though philosophical 'heavy' read it was as pleasant as any gripping novels. I couldn't stop reading it and I had to finish at the same night I've started. The quotations the writer chose for the beginning of each 'chapter' were elusive and very very thought provoking ones. And his comments about a variety of subjects were absolutely smart too. It replaced most of my thoughts with his. If you really want to prove it to someone that philosophy is not as confusing as people think then recommend this book as it is a delight for the hungry minds.Nice work
4,A Very Enjoyable Read,"I'm sure any reader of this book will take away some favourite sections. For me, the consecutively-placed entries on Betrayal, Loyalty & Blame were exemplary juxtapositions of those complementary topics.I would also recommend the entry on Racism.Given the brevity of the articles, sure they can't give you an in-depth discussion on the topic, but its just deep enough to get one thinking about the topics.I think this would be an excellent 'pocket-book' to dip into for anyone in their late teens trying to come to terms with the world.Having read this book, I moved directly to reading Graylings follow-up book, The Reason of Things.Only disappointment - no Bibliography, so when Grayling frequently quotes other Authors / Philosophers, I don't know where to go to for further reading."
4,Simulated Tanzanite Stone bracelet,This is a very nice bracelet for the price and I am happy with the color matching a ring and drop I have. My only problem is the size is a little too big and easily comes off my wrist.
4,Wild Right On,"First, I know the author so I'm biased. However, I also know the world she is describing (lawyers in smaller Florida towns and how they crash and burn from time to time). Others who recognize it will REALLY enjoy this."
5,For armchair travelers and history buffs alike,"Rion Klawinski blends history and travel in the south of France in writing Chasing The Heretics: A Modern Journey Through The Medieval Languedoc. This remarkably articulate and thoroughly engaging work is part history and part travelogue as Klawinski begins his journey in search of the facts surrounding a murder that happened in 1209, traces the steps of the pacifist Cathars (a 13th century religious sect); and the anti-Cathar Albigensian Crusade. Klawinski uncovers an almost forgotten history of a group of doomed Christians whose influence is still felt in the picturesque Languedoc region to this very day. The reader is treated to a sense of daily life as it was lived almost eight hundred years ago, as well as the ruggedly beauty country side, vibrant cities, and picturesque villages of the present. Chasing The Heretics is enthusiastically recommended reading for armchair travelers and history buffs alike!"
1,CHASING SOMETHING OTHER THAN HERETICS,"I HAVE VISITED THE AREA, AND WANTED TO READ MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY. THE REVIEW WAS PROMISING, BUT THE BOOK DID NOT DELIVER A BALANCED OR INSIGHTFUL APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER. HE ADMITS HE DID NOT RESEARCH THE MATTER WELL (REFERS TO A ILL WRITTEN BOOK AS ONE OF HIS GUIDES), ONLY VISITS THE AREAS NORTH OF THE CANAL DU MIDI (EXCEPT FOR ONE BRIEF EXCURSION TO MONTSEGUR, SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME DEALING WITH HIS FALLING OUT WITH CATHOLICISM RATHER THAN THE COMPLEX MATTER OF WHAT THE CATHARS WERE REALLY ABOUT. THERE ARE EXCELLENT BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT (RENE NELLI...UNFORTUNATELY ONLY AVAILABLE IN FRENCH)..THE LAMBERT BOOK IS A MUCH BETTER INVESTMENT. THERE ARE MANY BOOKS THAT WOULD HAVE ENLARGED AND ENHANCED HIS UNDERSTANDING, HAD HE BOTHERED TO LOOK AND READ. FOR SOMEONE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT, CHECK OUT WEBSITES FOR OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS. THE INFO (AND BOOKS) ARE THERE, AND WELL WORTH THE TIME."
4,"Really, quite good","The reader from Los Angeles is, I think, a little too strident. This is not a definitive history of the Cathars. It is not meant to be. It is an ambling and amiable personal tour to some of the sites associated with the Albigensian Crusade and is really quite good.Read in conjunction with Zoe Oldenbourg's Massacre at Montsegur."
3,Outtake collections are always a mixed bag,"I love the Smithereens, and I stocked up on their back catalog just after I saw them In December. A collection like this is fun the first couple of times, but after a while you know why they didn't make it to a major release. Not sorry I bought it, but the other three Smithereens collections I bought at the same time are seeing far more time in my CD player (yes, i still use that '80s technology....)"
5,Cool Pop Compelation,"If you like the ""Now"" Compelations, You'll like Pop To the Power of 16 also. The one thing that makes this Cd a little better is the never released tracks by NSync and Christina Aguilera. Christina's song ""Too Beautiful For Words"" Is a stand out. And if you're an NSync fan like me waiting for their new material ""Best of My Life"" by the boys will keep you patient. There are some other cool Pop songs from all kinds of artists like Billie, Hanson! , SpiceGirls and more that you are sure to like. I recommend this Cd to any Pop fan."
4,Pretty good,"There's a lot of great songs of this album- some of them top pop hits, and some never released tracks. Most of the tracks are awesome- try Nsync: 'Best of My Life', BSB: 'Quit Playing Games', or Billie: 'She Wants You'."
2,Wrong description,The product did not fit my car like they said it would it does not fit the Yukon Denali 2001 and up bit other than that it was new arrived on time
5,One of the best,This is one my favorite of this series. Yma Sumac is in especially good form on Babalu & Mbube. The linenotes are great.
4,I've never heard anything like it!,"I bought this as a gift for a Tiki Bar loving friend. After I got my hands on it I was hooked on Exotica!The music is so thematic, dramatic and tropical. Many songs sung in foreign languages, bandmembers imitating birdcalls, and heavy use of percussion and horns. It's so far from the music of today, that's for sure.I never thought I'd so enjoy music that sounds like the soundtrack to a cheap 1961 spy movie!"
5,This is an excellent compilation with a variety of artists.,"Excellent!! This is a wonderful introduction to the Exotica genre and offers tracks with varying international influences. Although the core of this compilation is provided by Les Baxter and Martin Denny, there are also excellent numbers by Chick Floyd, Tak Shindo and Yma Sumac."
4,Great Lounge CD,"This is a great blend of some awesome Lounge music.Grab your favorite exotic drink, plug in your Lava lamp,turn the lights down & lounge out!If you like Exotica Lounge music, you'll love this one."
4,Great for dinner parties,"It's very mellow, although there are some points where a woman is doing tribal screams or something. I think it's supposed to add to the tropical feel of the disc. It kind of surprised me, and I didn't particularly like that part but overall I really liked the CD. In fact, the whole Ultra-Lounge series is great."
3,Not My favorite among the Lounge Series CDs,"This CD is good to play as background, shopping music. There are a lot of selections, but I only liked a handful. It's non-invasive and not much stands out on this one. I liked the Ultra Lounge Bachelor Pad CD better."
3,Not a strong disk.,"I have several of the ultra lounge series and I really enjoy them! This disk has some great music on it too, but I found it to be the weakest of the series so far (out of about 7 disks). Also, the mixing is a bit low volume. This is a great disk to buy on sale."
3,Boreing,"I was a little dissapointed,very generic,kinda like hawaiian elavator music even the famus Marten Denny Quite Village was not the original it was more somber."
1,Worthless!,"This book would only be tolerable if you like romance novels, but in that case you'd be better off buying ""The Notebook"". - This book has no practical business value at all. I find its popularity to be deeply troubling. There is apparently something in the current business culture that makes people not want to think. They just want to feel good. The story presents ""facts"", but no sources. It presents inspiration, but no critical thought, and it doesn't prepare the reader for the real challenges that they will face in life or in business. Rather then presenting Vision from the appropriate management perspective, it presents it from a marketing perspective. This is how we want the public to feel about Vision. - Even from the viewpoint of `inspiration' it fails, because it's fictional. ANYONE can succeed in fiction. No?"
3,It doesn't weigh 7 pounds!!!,It doesn't weigh 7 pounds!!!Feels like less than 1 pound - it is a thin material. Haven't tried it to see if it works yet.
5,I love it,The medieval publication is reproduced in this very visually appealing modern reprint. It satiates tastes for medieval romances. The introduction is consice and informative.
5,XP is the BEST,"I am currently running my computer under Microsoft's XP Pro Release Candidate 1. It's amazing. My computer runs a lot faster now and really brings out the glory of the Intel Pentium 4. In my opinion, the best new feature is its stability. For the 3 months that I've had this operating system, it hasn't crashed once! I've forgotten what the blue screen of death looks like. The new user interface is also a nice change, but if you don't like it, you can go back to the old interface with the click of a button.All of these people who are afraid of giving private information to Microsoft shouldn't be. You don't have to send them any personal information to activate you new OS. Only when you register do you have to give private information, but registration is optional.I would highly recommend this new operating system to everyone."
1,"The older, buggier version","A little slower, a little more buggy and unstable, I'm surprised it's still sold when newer versions of the operating system are available."
4,Here It Is!,"Microsoft got it right on this one. Smooth, secure and basically glitch free. The only heavy complaint I have is the price, but I have a feeling this will be a viable operating system for quite a while."
3,The beginning of the end of unstable OS's,This operating system has alot of potential however i do not reccomend using it unless u have a processor faster then 1 GHz and 256MB of ram if your's is slower use Me or Win 2k Pro
4,"GREAT OS, but not so great price","it is a very very good operating system with multi-language support,cool GUI and very stable system. it rarely crashes, and even when i see it crashed, it will tell me what was the problem, for example, it says it is because of the bad graphic driver that cause the system unstability instead of the stupid blue screen that tells nothing but lock the computer. well, it doesn't support some old softwares, but let's face it, when windows 95 comes out, many old dos softwares become incompatible, but now, who cares about them. it is a highly recommended operating system.BUT, a big BUT, the price is... damn crazy,(...) it is crazy to buy 2, 3, or 4 copies just because my family need 4 computers, and each computer needs a license for it, hey microsoft, you dominate the OS market and what you do is RIP OFF your customer, i think OS is just like phone service that needs to be regulated. one star off for it's crazy price with stupid activation."
1,A travesty of an operating system,"Your privacy and wallet does not matter to Microsoft. To top it all off, you must completely relearn Windows. Don't ever buy this sorry product, and Microsoft will learn not to redesign their OS every 2 years."
2,get ready to track down drivers,"Don't waste your money on this one. You'll have to spend hours downloading all new drivers for everything attached to your computer. Like your printer, scanner, and everything else.And windows XP doesn't offer anything to make it worth the hassle."
2,"over priced,",I BIN LOOKING TO GET WIN XP PRO AN YOUR PRICE IS AT LEAST 50 TO A 100 DOLLARS HIGHER THAN WHAT I<VE SEEN
1,Unreceived Goods,"We ordered this rice cooker on September 7, 2009. Delivery was to be about September 11. On that date, we checked the Amazon site and found out that there was something wrong with our payment method. I followed directions, but was told to try again another day. I tried to cancel the order but was told it was being readied for shipment, and could not be cancelled. I kept looking around the site, and found another page that said there was another Undescribed problem. I went to a store and spent $45.00 more for one so I can cook rice, which is a staple of my diet. I hope that the situation resolves itself someday, so I can cancel the order, or if necessary, return the order."
1,Windows XP for Hp Pavilion,If you have a Hp Pavilion DO NOT UPGRADE to Windows XP will not work. I started the upgrade from 98 to xp and it gets half the way done and says setup cannot continue because of controller restarting. So I put windows 98se works fine
3,"""Maquilage""","I'm using Windows XP Professional (preview version) and it looks pretty nice. The software is practically the same Win2000, but with a colorfull interface, with the look of a Teletubbies episode.Enjoy!"
2,wait until the next update,"I just switched to XP Professional at work and have been rather disappointed. There appear to be numerous bugs. Several of my programs don't run correctly -- even in the highly-touted compatibility mode. The weird structure makes accessing the desktop confusing and further buries some functions (sometimes you still need DOS, something they like to ignore). The security enhancements have been really annoying -- plus they can't be that secure due to the numerous security upgrades they keep issuing. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay for my upgrade, but I've be upset if I had."
2,Took it off my Dell Dimension L600R,"If you run:Adaptec EZ CD CreatorSymantec PC AnywhereYahoo Messenger (I know, not a big big deal)Then I'd highly reccommend not going to XP until SP1.Too many hassles.I gave it a shot (TWICE) but its compatibility is very suspect.Back to Windows 2000.You would think they would have software compaitibility worked out. Especially with EZ CD Creator."
2,"Hype, hype & more hype","I have Windows 2000 Professional and I love it. I've only ran into 1 out of over 200 (!) software applications/games made for Windows 98 that wouldn't work on it. I don't know how many times I've read on the net that something for Win 98 won't work on XP that works fine on my Win 2K machine. XP stability? Got it already. Good graphics? Run the same game or whatever on the same machine with Win XP and then Win 2K or even 98 and you won't be able to tell the difference in the graphics. Plus I won't have to beg M$ for permission to use their OS on my computer if I need to reinstall it.So do yourself a favor and buy a copy of Windows 2000 here on Amazon.com or ebay, spend less and not have to hope Microsoft doesn't cheat you out of it like they have so many others when it came to re-activating XP."
4,Stick with Windows 2000 for another year..,By far Windows 2000 is the best OS from MS at the moment. Here are the pros and cons of both.- 2000 is a way more stable than XP and uses less resourses.- Most software still works with 2000. Most new software is made compatible with 2000.- 2000 is still updated by MS.- Graphics on 2000 are not the best.- XP uses a lot of resourses and requires a new computer system.- XP still has some bugs and issues that need to be fixed.- XP is heavy on memory and can sometimes hang for ages.- XP is what all domestic home computer users should get if they are getting a new machine.2000 or XP. The choice is yours. I would get 2000 but MS may not be supporting it as much past the start of 2005 from what I hear.
4,"Hey, I'm not complaining","While I was a little skeptical about running this at first, I am very very glad that I did. The new features are definately worth it, and it makes many tasks much easier than in 98. BUT... the only problem that I have had with it, is that some programs that worked well in 98 or 95 just arent supported in XP. So be warned: if you are running reeeeeallly important stuff on your computer, do the diagnostic thing at the beginning of installation and MAKE DARN SURE that none of your VITAL programs are listed under the ""we cant run this in XP"" (or whatever) section. Another good idea, if you can afford to, is to get the full version, wipe your harddrive (save your important files), and install it on a clean disk. The upgrade is like remodeling your house: the same wires and plumbing will be there, just pretty new wallpaper. Go for the full version; your computer will boot and run soooooooooooooo much faster."
3,more of the same,I would rate XP a 3 star just above 98's 2 star rating. Several incompatibility problems and frequent application crashes are my biggest gripes.
1,Dont Be Fooled!,"XP Pro is just Win2k with a pretty GUI! Thats it! My school got it the other day. It's not worth the money. Just look at the version number. its 5.1. win2k is 5.0! Plus, (opinion) I find the ""Did you buy a pirated product"" notice annoying."
1,Do not buy unless,Do not buy unless you have a PC with at least 600 MHz it slows down the computer to a great extend. Remember that none of the offers tells you that you can not use it on your PC and Laptop. You have to uninstall it before you can use it on the second Computer and than can not use the other computer untill you uninstalled it from the one you use. At the price a typical Microsoft system to rip you off.The program has a life off it's own and decides in the middle of your using the computer that you should be doing something it thinks is usefull and keeps on interupting your thoughts.I have uninstalled it and find that WS 2000 is a much more usefull version. One day when MS has decided that after you pay for as program you can make your own decisions when and how to operate your computer it may be usefull to have the new features available.Almost none of the older hardware is compatable even with upgrades and those that can be upgraded dont work well with xp
2,You can't get much worse...,"I recently go this XP Pro deal and I have to say one thing, AWFUL! The only reason why I didn't give this 1 star is because of it's new sleek design, other than that, it's terrible. Half of the stuff I used to be able to run on Windows 98 SE doesn't run with XP Pro. I have tried reinstalling, everything, no matter, it won't work. I get very angry with this...now I can see why some people are so objective towards XP! If you want a good OS, get 2000...XP is awful."
2,Windows XP Blows!,"I'd personally would rather have Windows 98 on my computer than Windows XP. Windows XP is extremely easy for hackers to break in, unlike the other Windows. XP also has a firewall that doesn't able me to have chats with people on programs like AIM, voice chats. If you are going to network the internet, don't try, get someone to od it because the firewall once again! Windows XP has alot of problems. Although you can get a patch to try to protect your computer from hackers at Microsoft.com. The only thing I thought was cool about XP, is it allready has a cd burning utility on it sao you may burn without having to download a program, unless your burning a game with a CD-KEY."
1,"DON""T GET RIPPED OFF","Windows XP PRO. Does everything it brags about, but it's what it didn't metion that really [ticked] me off. I bought this product, installed it, and it works great, so I decided to install it on my second machine. This is what makes this product [a rip off]. To install it on a second machine you have to purchase an additional license which costs you the same ammount of money as buying the product a second time. What is Microsoft trying to accomplish by ripping people off?! They believe that by making it restricted by activation they can force people to give them more money. Well screw them, all they did was make me and the average user really [ticked] off! O yeah, they also gave hackers a reason to pirate this software."
3,No use for me.,"I tried both Home edition and Professional. In general inpression is that: it is more fancy. But I do not really need these funcy function. I do not care whether I need to click few more buttons to connect to Internet or not. I do not care multi user logon, since there are only one screen. No matter how many users are logged on, only one person can really use it. I do not care whether it is more stable or not, since restarting the machine only take one min. I am just an regular user who use win98(which comes with the system) and star office to write something, IE or NS to read news, use webmail to check email, maybe play couple of games. That is all the function that I needed."
3,Don't buy the full retail version,Only recently have I discovered the OEM versions of Microsoft operating systems. OEM cost $130. Full cost $280. Regardless of what you pay you can only install on a single computer. Why give your money to Microsoft?
4,a microsoft surprise,"its works and well. xp new all my drivers, and runs great. if you liked 2000, this is easy. however, the puffy colors can be annoying. if you have the memory and power.this is the os for youif you have a dsl line, that uses the ppoe dialer, this is your os"
3,Works well but you don't really need it!,"I wrote this review years ago, when there was a real choice between keeping older versions of windows and upgrading to XP. Now that we've been forced to use XP, I guess what I said doesn't mean anything now.--------------------------------------------------------------Windows XP (either version-they're both the same) has advantages and added features over previous versions of Windows, but all they do are save you a few seconds and make things more colorful.The problems with Windows XP are: 1)There is no DOS prompt (older programs will not work on XP) 2)A lot of hardware and software is incompatible 3)The stupid animated icons and unnecessary colors and dummy features will get on your nerves.YOU DONT REALLY NEED THIS!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!Windows 98SE is good enough for most purposes."
2,Great....until you have a problem,"I have had XP for 6 months and it was working fine. I installed the Office service packs today and the whole system came crashing down! I don't know what MS is thinking, but they seriously need to get their act together. I would recommend to anyone considering XP to get an Apple."
1,not soakers--leakers,Bought two of these this spring...both of them leaked so badly from a poorly fitted hose end that I have had to replace the coupling. Go for Swan or some other brand with better (or at least SOME?) quality control.
2,Wrong length bulb,"Because I had ordered this bulb from you I thought it would be the same size. It was too long, but I am able to use it. I can't put the insect attraction under the light, however."
2,A small light duty cargo strap worth $10 tops,"I received this and didn't even open the clear plastic bag that it was in. This is nothing more than a lightweight ratcheting cargo strap plus two carabiners that you can get in any hardware store for less than $10. I just assumed that for $30, it was much bigger because cargo straps do come in many sizes and the MUCH bigger ones can cost $30. I gave it two stars instead of one because other than the misleading description of ""heavy duty"" it probably does what it says. Since I don't want to get into debates with material engineers and lawyers, I am not saying what constitutes heavy vs. light duty in terms of stress loads. However, if you go into a hardware store, you can see what is called heavy duty and what is not and something this size falls into the ""not"" category for how every other similar product is labeled."
1,This would make a Great Childrens Book.........,"This book on Camaro's and the whole (Great American Car) series is not for the advanced car enthusiast. I read this entire book in less than two minutes, and I even took time to look at all six pictures. A total waste of money. The print was very large and had the vocabulary that a five year old could read with no problem. The price of this book should not have cost any more than $3.00"
1,NOT TO MUCH INFO,I WISH I COULD FIND MORE INFO SO MY BUDDY WOULD STOP LOOKING FOR A 1972 CAMARO BOOK
2,"not really funny, narrative is too plain","I bought this book relying on above reviews and the fact that the author is Georgian. I myself am Georgian. Finally got the book, put aside the book I was in a middle of reading ""Franny and Zooey"" by Salinger.I read the book, not really funny, narrative is too plain, not to say dull.Back to Salinger, real gem.Suggestion for those who wants to get familiar with the Georgian literature: Nodar Dumbadze was a Georgian writer and one of the most popular authors in the late 20th-century Georgia. I personally like the most his novel ""Me, Grandma, Iliko and Ilarioni"" full of lyricism and humor."
4,"""Memoirs"" of Old Russian Emigrant","This book about poor emigrant from Russia, who came to America from Russian Georgia. He came here with no money but with big dream...Years after his wife helped him write this book which was written with Georgian humor. Book is fun to read."
2,Very Disappointing Soft Psychedelia,"If you like warmed-over Syd Barrett, here's your guy. A few nice tunes but becomes monotonous very quickly. Stoltz can't sing worth a damn - I'd like this a lot more if his vocals were wiped and a real singer overdubbed."
5,wow!,I never thought a band could create the melodoies and sounds that i've had waiting in my head all my life.
3,"Good, but not their best.","I have to agree with one of the previous reviews and say that this seems to be the only J.E.W. CD that doesn't make it into my cd player. It's very ""punk pop"" and hard to follow sometimes. I would definately suggest Clarity and Bleed American over this album."
4,Good debut release,"This cd shows the potential of a young, indie-influenced band trying to make its way up through the underground world, but look where they're at today, TRL. Too bad. With this cd they showed the hope of what never happened. I never would have thought that Jimmy Eat World would ever want to go so mainstream. This cd is fairly well produced, but i think some of the vocals are honestly a bit....bad? But that's not really what matters, their music is great, and it's a good cd. Buy this CD if you want a different band from Bleed American."
4,This band is toooo Good,"While Clarity is still my favorite Jimmy CD, this CD shows their emotional progression as one of the most amazing bands out there. For those of you who love both the slower and faster songs on their breakthrough ""Bleed American"" this CD lets you know where they are coming from. The vocals on this album are really rough, and a lot of the guitars are clashy, reminiscent of older Pumpkins stuff on Gish and Siamese Dreams, but it's still a punk/emo CD. Anyway, not really much to say, just buy this CD and support a great band. Yeah, JEW rocks."
2,..................meh * * 1/2 stars,the noisy beginings of Jimmy Eat World. Here the bands major label debut showcases the begining stages but here they dont sound anything like what they've become.Here the band dabbles in noisey emotive-punk and some dabbles in post hardcore. the songs arent particularly tuneful but the enrgy is defiently evident here in this btahc of songs. Jim adkins voice here is virtually unreconizable to his signature tenor of late (a similar case with Silverchair....getting more and more tuneful as time went on). This is probablly not something you should start off with this band
5,Greatest Band Of ALL TIME!,"If your reading this review, most likely you've already heard of Jimmy Eat World, and already know that they wont let you down with anything less than amazing music. So you are reading this reviews because you love JEW and you like to see when other people agree. JEW RULES!!!This Cd is amazing, if you have not heard it, then i suggest you buy it without a second thought, because you know you wont regret it. In my oppinion the greatest song on this album is the emotion filled ""Anderson Mesa"" In this phenominal track you feel the Emotion Jim Adkins portrays the extrem happiness Like your in a dream, in which your floating and wind is carrying you out into a field of sweet sweet rock. This is a great cd go buy it and love it as much as i do!"
4,Long Road to the Radio starts here...,"If you listen to this record and Jimmy Eat World (aka Bleed American) back to back, oyu're probably going to wonder if it was the same band. A lot of growth musically over the course of 3 full lengths and an EP or two. This album reminds me of The Get Up Kids' Four Minute Mile because of the raw sound and heart-on-the-sleeve songwriting crossed with ""Diary"" by Sunny Day Real Estate (I really don't have a good explanation why, it just does). An interesting look into where the band was before they went power-pop (Jimmy Eat World - the 2000s version of Cheap Trick maybe?)"
4,Achieving Flow,"Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi coined the term ""Flow"" back in 1975 to describe the experience that many of us are familiar with: time is suspended, our focus is completely on the task, and everything around us ceases to exist. In this book, the author attempts to map and apply his research to the world of management and businesses.I doubt that some of the arguments and propositions the author makes will ever make it into the mainstream management literature, but the overarching argument for optimizing the work experience to match the challenge of the task, skill of the person, and giving them the opportunity to grow is right on target. If there are no mistakes, they are not pushing hard enough. If they are coasting, the motivation and morale is likely lacking as well.A thought provoking read and one that every entrepreneur and founder should read."
2,Watered down rehashing of Flow,"One can't be sure that this book isn't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad, that if this weren't crappy, it wouldn't sell. Even for someone who believes in Csik's theory of flow, this book is a no-win blow-out. Instead of making clear statements backed by evidence, the book's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions. There is no reason to read this, when his original popularization, Flow, more carefully and clearly summarizes Csikszentmihalyi's interesting research."
3,"A Worthwhile Read, but Scientifically Lacking.","At a minimum, Mihály Csíkszentmihályi's documentation of flow reiterates management concepts that are important to remember. While going through daily motions, it is common for people to fall into rhythms which lack the proper balance of challenge and skill requirement. Aside from one's career, the book challenges the reader to put even the most routine of their tasks into perspective, and to see where flow can be integrated. So, to even those who see flow as intuitive at a very basic level, Good Business can act as a reminder of important considerations beyond the salary a career may provide. However, the book falls short in delivering even a negligibly comprehensive psychological explanation as to the impacts of differing behavioral strategies in business, but is nevertheless a worthwhile recap of some managerial ""best practices"" for managers and non-managers alike."
4,I thought that this was a very good book.,"I liked it for its Strategic value, I didnt care much for the translators Comontery takeing up more of the book than what Sun Tsu wrote.But other than that I thought it was a very good book."
4,A must ...,"This is one of the oldest Masamuni Shiro movies, a must for any anime fan of his, I received it quickly and it is is very fine condition."
4,Amazing anime. Imperfect video quality.,"This is a five-star classic anime, but the DVD looses one star for having a not-so-great video transfer.Black Magic M-66 is loads of fun and beautifully animated. The story is very similar to that of The Terminator movie, but more fast paced. What gets me about this show is just how scary the killer robots are. You will feel a very real sense of danger when you see these robots in action. Just the way they move is creepy.This classic anime is a very entertaining ride, while it lasts. Unfortunately, the video quality is poor; it looks like a low-resolution video you would see on the internet with noticeable pixelation. I'd love to see Black Magic M-66 remastered some day, because it's a great show."
3,Black Magic M-66,"Typical anime. Not bad, not amazing though. I still buy it again if i could go back."
5,"Combat, androids and great artwork.","In Black Magic, the anime, two military android assassins are lost. This wouldn't be so bad, but for the fact they are still carrying mission information used for testing. Their target is their creator's granddaughter.Sybel, a freelance reporter, becomes involved in the deadly cat and mouse game between the robots and the military.Has the voices of Steven Blum and Beau Billingslea as many of the military, along with lots of violence, nudity and strong language.Not really anything like the manga, but still fun to watch."
2,Poor Shirow...,"Masamune Shirow writes the some of the deepest and most thoughtful manga ever, but whenever they become animated, they get butchered and stripped of nearly everything that made them worthwhile reading. This is no exception, and the animation and art direction in general aren't particularly good either. Appleseed and even Ghost In the Shell are likewise vapid and shallow anime versions of his great manga, though at least GItS had some high production values behind it. In short, skip the videos, stick to the books."
2,Not helping,"Bought this hoping will boost my radio signal after I switch to a dynavin unit in my BMW. Connected to 12v power, still reception without any improvment."
1,Beautiful is boring,"Might have been a humorous look back at HS days or the silliness of prom queens. Instead a rant about whether or not the narrator was beautiful. Compelling perhaps at 15, but not as an adult book. And unlike classic novels, the narrator learned nothing."
3,Disappointed,"The book is a nice easy read, but didn't really live up to its description. The character isn't as likable as you'd think and I expected the book to be more of a light comedy rather than a description of her very mixed up life in a melodramatic way."
2,Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen,"Much of the ""action"" seems pointless. Shifts from past to present aren't smooth. Plot is weak. ""Heroine"" does not evoke much sympathy."
1,Memoirs of a Prom Queen,I found this book tedious and annoying and couldn't finish it. The bad decisions that the main character kept making drove me crazy
2,Memories of an Ex Prom Queen,This was not my favourite book! The story drifted along sometimes without a point and the heroine seemed cynical and disallusioned about life. It was one of those books that you keep reading because you are sure that it must get better and...it didn't. Just not my taste.
3,wordy and confusing,"The book is all over the place . it is painful to get through. It seems choppy like the author wasn't sure where to to next . and what's the fascination with the character's ""button"" ? We get it. but over and over? Seems immature. I was disappointed that I paid for it."
2,Hard to follow,I did not really care for this book. It was not at all what I expected. I did not even like the main character and thought that the writing was hard to follow. I would not read anything else from this auther.
3,Lukewarm,"This book was okay. I am at a loss to figure out why the book is titled Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen, when the main character was a former Homecoming queen. I found her to be a sad, shallow person. Her only concern was finding a man who felt she was beautiful. Which is code for: Who wanted to sleep with her. I really would not recommend this book to anyone. The shallowness of the character, and her inability to learn from her mistakes simply annoyed me.In no way does that reflect on the author's writing ability. There is nothing wrong with her style, I simply did not like the story. And, really, it should have been called Memoirs of a Slut, because she just sleeps around trying to feel beautiful."
2,Not What I Expected,"After being told to read this ""great feminist novel"" I picked it up, planning to read it on a trip. While it wasn't what I expected, I can relate to Sasha's wanting to be beautiful, but what I found annoying is her need for every man to find her desirable. Does she really need to know if her therapist finds her attractive? She expected a perfect life, because of her looks, but her life wasn't any different then a realistic one."
4,Did Sasha represent young women of the1940's/50's?,"I enjoyed the book but found it hard to believe that toward the end of the 1940's that this youngwoman was having sex and that by her mid twenties she had traveled to Europe and had close to 30 lovers. I always thought the sexual revolution started in the late 60's and that most young woman of her time were virgins or MAYBE had one or so sexual experiences but this seemed unbelieveable. I enjoyed the book until she and Will had Andy. I understand her absolute love for her daughter, but the book seemed to go downhill from there. It was almost like a rush to an ending."
4,absurd on a new level,"Though slow at times, this movie truly rocks. How can you go wrong with a character who ends up with a chain saw for a peg-leg. corny dialogue and scenes make this a great film. Though not as good as Tokyo Gore Police, this movie is not to be missed. Gorey, violent, and funny this movie is one of the best movies to come out in recent times."
3,Best Shock Film in the last 10 years!!!,"Best Shock Film I have seen in the last 10 years! It starts out running and never stops! It's a Japanese School Girl Blood Bath Gore Fest that will have you laughing one second then going EWE the next. If you are into low budget, cheesy, gorey movies then I highly recommend this movie."
3,Prepared to get blasted out of your seat!,"If you like Planet Terror, than you'll love Machine Girl. This one armed, one gatlin gun armed girl will blow you away. It's cheese at its best. A cult classic like Evil Dead. Haven't seen this much blood in a movie since I don't know when. When a girl seeks revenge for the death of her brother, all heck breaks loose. Filled with imaginitive death scenes and more blood than the sea has water, you laugh, cringe and have a great time. Only downside was when the girl loses her arm, they do a terrible time trying to hide it in her recovery scenes."
4,Revenge! Seved as cold as sushi!,"This is a great little film. The budget is fairly low but the directors and producers do allot with what they have. Well shot, well acted...and just generally all around fun. The story revolves around a heroin who loses her arm in a fight with the bad guys ( ala planet terror no doubt) and then goes around exacting justice for her and her brother. With lots of gore...a good bit of cheese....and some clever camera work...machine girl really delivers."
3,translated by ....picasso?,"the copy I received was translated either by something from another planet or perhaps the ghost of Salvador Dali..it was at time surreal and never really in sync with what was going on on screen...as far as the film goes...an amazing collection of one amazing little lady fighting as many guys as possible...the stunts were.....breathtaking, the film is a bit weak on plot but that could be because I was trying to follow the subtitles from beyond the realm of reality!if you buy it..find out what the translation is first!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ACTION. THE ACTING COULD OF BEEN A LOT BETTER BUT THE SCHOOL GIRL OUTFIT SURE MADE UP FOR THAT... I KNOW FOR SURE IT WOULD BE A MUST SEE IF ""MACHINE GUN GIRL 2"" COMES OUT."
3,Funny Bloody - Cute,"Imagine Death Wish mixed with the Evil Dead, then replace the leading male with a Japanese girl. Thugs kill off her friends, so she dedicates herself to avenge their death. Eventually she loses an arm and has it replaced with a machine gun. It's fun to watch the criminals get blown apart. Messy, bloody, funny death!"
1,either love it or hate it!,"And I hate it for sure. The ""Scrapheap Girl"" is the worst movie I seen this year and one of the worst i seen ever. Everyting about it is bad. the acting, cheesy dialogue, everything. And its meant to be that way. Well to each his own. I truly believe this movie is either a love it or hate it and no in between. Anybody who is in between, 3 star reviews for example. is worried about votes, review ranking, and being cool with the amazon cliques roaming this website. In other words, they bulls***in' and don't want to come clean and say this flick sucks."
5,Drill Bra!!,"Those two words are all you need to know. This movie is long on action, and short on plot. That's not to say there isn't a plot, but it's very predictable, and just barely cohesive enough to hold together the almost random scenes of gratuitous violence (Actually, violence isn't a good enough word. It's more like extreme slapstick) together.However, there is a method to the madness. This is FAR more than a bunch of swordfights with arterial spray thrown in. The methods of death-dealing are what makes this movie an unexpected gem. Anyone can cut off a sushi chef's fingers, but what movie has the testicular fortitude to make him eat them afterwards?If that's what you're into, then this movie won't sit on your shelf much. Every one of your equally sick friends will be wanting to borrow it, and that's a fact!"
3,Get a clue,"There seems to be many here who think this movie is absolute trash. In one sense it is. However, one has to view The Machine Girl from the proper perspective; this is the Japanese version of camp and cheese all rolled up into one gory horror movie. With that said, you shouldn't expect something thought provoking. On the other hand, you should expect that this flick will some day gain cult status in a relatively short time.Admittedly, this slice and dice approach to horror is over the top but that's what gives this movie its charm. Don't take it seriously because that's not how it was meant to be viewed. Have low expectations, relax, and enjoy the show.As far as the transfer goes, I would like to point out that the video quality is first-rate with muted colors and solid blacks and whites. The audio was also clear.If you're not sure, rent it before you buy it. That's the safest approach."
2,Not worth 15 dollars,"I got this game for $5 and I plan on returning it.I teach 1st grade. At the end of the school day I letmy students play with a few games.I don't think they'll like this game at all.The unresponsive controls make it hard to jump objects.It gets boring fast!If you're a teacher, these are the best electronic games I'vefound so far:Connect FourBig Screen Tetris (Radica)Power Touch learning systemFrogger (Milton Bradley?)"
5,Left Behind The Assassins,I really enjoy the Assassins: An Experience in Sound and Drama (audio CD) (Purchased on 01/13/2009
5,Assassins,Left Behind is a wonderful series. I am looking forward to listening to all the audio cd's.I have read the books and they are just as great.
5,A person everyone should know,"There is something inspirational for everyone in John Fountain's story. I hope this book will be widely read, and it deserves to be considered a classic."
5,fuego de ande (Audio CD),Yma sumac Sumac has such a beautiful 5 Octave range I love her sound - the jungle sound! I'll get more as soon as I as I can decide which I want next.
4,Re editorial review,"I wish that reviewers who review albums would learn a little more about the facts of music. A four octave range does not mysteriously become an ""almost five octave range""."
1,"Yma is great, but not here.","I'm a great fan of Yma Sumac, but must admit that this CD is her worst. Acualy, there is a worse one yet produced in the 60's by Les Baxter, whic she demanded to be taken off the market. The rest of her CDs are pure joy. Listne up and compare."
5,How humbling!,"This movie is what the definition of family is all about. All persons of school age should be required to watch ""I Remember Mama"".Thanks"
5,"A must see for Americans that ""think"" life is a hardship!","Truly fantastic and well portrayed about an immigrant family who survives the toils and hardships in a foreign land. This is only accomplished by unity and strength within the family circle through courage and determination. It should be shown in every American household as it would reinforce the family structure and instill gratitude for the all too many ""pleasures"" Americans take for granted! It is a ""wake up call"" for those proclaiming to have such a difficult and miserable life!"
5,I Remember Mama,Bought this for my sister for a Christmas gift. She has always loved this movie. It came in great condition and quickly.
5,A great movie.,"No drugs, no violence just a great entertaining movie from another generation. Did I say 'no drugs'? Well, there is coffee. I think you'll enjoy this movie."
5,I Remember Mama,Wonderful movie. Everyone should own this and watch it over and over again. The character building bonds of love and family through difficult times is a lesson for all of us. You will share tears of laughter and sadness throughout the movie.
5,A timeless favorite!,"Such a wonderful movie! I don't know why they don't make movies like this anymore. Great characters, writing, and acting!"
5,fine,it was the movie that I expected to get but again i need more words to fill this requirement for
1,Bad quality recording,"From the description, the movie sounds like one that I would love, but the audio quality is so bad that even with the volume turned literally as high as it would go, I still could not make out much of the dialogue! I don't normally have any trouble hearing or understanding, so it's not a problem with my hearing. Picture quality is not very good either, but that would not prevent me from understanding what is happening in the story."
3,The Past,"As a child I loved the Movie. Seeing it once again, I did enjoy it, but I have to admit it was kind of corny. I guess as the saying goes, ""You can't go back!"""
5,Flys circles around other frisbees,"I brought this to a local beach festival here in Japan, and the locals were amazed at the ease and precision this frisbee provided. If you're looking for a frisbee that is great for adults as well as kids, then look no further.Safe - soft, rubbery edges mean that even if you get hit by this, you're probably not going to get seriously injured.Fun - very easy to throw and fly. ""Dummy proof"" aerodynamics.Durable - No visible damage from a good 4+ hours on the beach, exchanging hands throughout the day.Price - Free super-saver shipping, and this awesome low price? Skip the $6 junk from wally world, do yourself a favor, and get this Superdisc.I kind of wish you could choose the color, but I wasn't dissatisfied with the blue one I got. I was only afraid it would come in hot pink or something!"
4,Flies Okay,"I can't agree with all of the positive reviews. I was convinced by the reviews and purchased the Superdisc. It flies pretty good but I don't like the lack of choice of a color; I got green and that is my least favorite normal color. Also, my 6 and 3 year old grnadsons won't even attempt to throw the Superdisc. I guess they were discouraged by other flat disc toys."
2,Superlame,"I disagree with the other reviewers. This is a cheap child's toy. Buy a regular hard disc if you want to throw it far. It's too lightweight to get any real distance. It does have a nice soft border but that is probably the only thing going for it. Great for a dog, but no distance champion. Buy a cheaper Discraft or something in the 170-180 gram range if you want distance.It wasn't worth the 12$ I paid for it at Academy."
1,hate it,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. It was very wrinkled when it came out of the box. After a lot of heavy books placed on it and laying flat for several weeks, the wrinkles still have not come out. It's totally unusable."
5,Ditto!,"Like Volume #1, this is a very praiseworthy compilation for anyone without the Motown assortment in his or her collection, at a very good price. All original, no maddening re-takes.Larry Wood"
5,Who knew?,"Finally an UNCENSORED, historic look back at the last 50 plus years of Communist rule in China- from a CHINESE perspective. After reading these commentaries, I was dumbfounded. How shocking and shameful is the history of the Chinese Communist Party. The sad part, is that most of this 'never-before-heard' history failed to make it beyond the boundaries of this ill fortuned country- UNTIL NOW. Inform yourself - this is a must read!"
3,Still useful,"As Plath's first biographer, Butscher was bound to make certain errors. As a historian of the genre, I can tell you this is inevitable, no matter how scrupulous the author tries to be. Butscher was denied access to certain sources because at the time Lois Ames was writing the authorized biography and the Plath estate refused to cooperate with Butscher. He persevered, however, and was able to interview many important sources. Certainly all Plath biographers are in his debt"
1,Boring,This was incredibly boring. I managed to get through Chapter 3 and stopped. I just couldn't digest any more. There are other far more interesting criminal books out there.
2,Warranty,"MSE states it backs their product 100%. Well I have a MSE C6656A print cartridge that is no good. No place on the cartridge or 6 sides of the box states how to get the warranty. No place to call, write, etc..."
3,"water, water, water","I found these heavily discounted at a discount store, so I picked up 5 different nature recordings; Mountain Stream, Tropical Lagoon, Dawn & Dusk, Winter Storm & this one - Wilderness. They're all pretty good except there seems to be an incessant obsession with running water with most of these recordings. For example, I've often been in the ""Wilderness"", and yes, there is running water in the wilderness, but it isn't everywhere and you don't always hear it at all times... It also seems to me that the recorders tried to pack in too many nature sounds all at once. You can hear elk, hawks, crickets, birds and other noises - all behind the constant sound of moving water. What's wrong with just wind, and perhaps the occasional hawk or elk call? Why not just night sounds?Sometimes less is more. Quiet is nice. Cut the water."
4,I've been very happy with it.,"I'm mostly using indoors (a big group camping trip will be my first trial of it outside later this year), but this device is really designed to work great outside. Everything is ground fault protected, buttons are covered with a rubber face, and the circuit breakers are covered with metal lid. The one suggestion I would have is that the outlets are not labeled as far as what phase or which breaker they are associated with, so it's too easy to overload one leg of the circuit."
4,Well thought out.,"This book is for those of you who are sick of redundant and mundane bureaucratic routine work, and wan to learn about the ways to change such system. This books points out inefficiencies of bureaucracy and promotes the idea of simple and quick approach to technology, which the way we do things. It also gives some good examples from a few corporations that are being affected by their implementation of rational organizational structure i.e. bureaucratic structure. It's an advocate of creative behavior at jobs regardless of the nature."
2,long-awaited sequel big disappointment,"SInce reading ""Jack of Hearts"" and ""Living Upstairs"" I had eagerly been awaiting the next Nathan Reed saga. When it finally came out I was so excited, but as soon as I started reading it I was very disappointed. The characters fail to live up to the caliber of those in Hansen's other books (who can forget Rick Ames and Alma?). The characters in ""Cutbank Path"" are shallow and underdeveloped, and not at all memorable. Add to that the deplorable editing/proofreading job (I never saw so many typos in one book!). I will continue to re-read ""Jack of Hearts"" and ""Living Upstairs,"" but I don't think I'll pick up this one again."
3,OK,"The Nathan Reed series is one of the best works of Joseph Hansen.The Cutbank Path, although interesting and very good as a reflection of the period when the plot takes place , is not at the same level of the two previous works.The story holds your attention ,and you want to proceed to see what happens.Unfortunately the end was quite disappointing for me,very implausible and unbelievable.Maybe the author intended to continue the series, and the explanation smight be forthcoming.This is no longer possible however, and all of the fans of Nathan will have to construe in their minds the future of the nice hero.I deemed also a bit farfetched the sudden ""conversion "" of Nathan and his affair with the neighbouring lady.Again , some explanation would be coming later, and again I felt frustrated.In any event, a good read."
3,Product is not the same as image - be sure to read the text description!,"Hi - I provided feedback to Amazon about the discrepancy between the product image and the product description. The CD I received was conducted by Helmuth Rilling (his name is mentioned in the product description), and not the performance conducted conducted by Nestor Andrenacci (from the product image). I am hoping that this will be fixed to avoid confusion for future shoppers."
4,Authoritative and Readable,"This fine book is an excellent reference volume on peripheral nerve injuries. It is organized in an anatomically topical manner with chapters covering all major divisions of the peripheral nervous system. Each chapter reviews the anatomy of that division (eg, brachial plexus, median nerve, etc), the clinical phenomenology and pathology of characteristic nerve injuries, diagnosis, clinical electrophysiology, and management. It is written clearly and organized well with good illustrations. This book is my chosen reference when dealing with focal peripheral nerve problems. I haven't seen a competitor volume that is as comprehensive or as clear. Recommended as a component of the standard bookshelf of all neurologists."
2,Website description is erroneous,"As of 08/10/10, the Amazon description of this item is inaccurate. It claims to be an 800-page summary of research on polygraphy, when in fact it is a 70-page supplement to a previously issued 800-page volume. Worse, the supplement does not consist of independent text, but only of update paragraphs, sentences, and graphs keyed to the 800-page volume. Since each update lacks the context of the original volume, it's useless unless you own the 800-page book. Be warned.As of 07/30/11, the Amazon description has been updated to clarify that this is the 2002 supplement, but it's still important to know that it's keyed to the original text and can't be read without said original."
4,Hilarious!,"If you ever wanted to read the Holy Scriptures and laugh to tears, this ""translation"" is it! The funniest thing is that it was done in all seriousness! I don't know anything about the author (Clarence Jordan), but if he was still around I would send him $20 for the entertainment he provided me.This book ""domesticates"" the new testament. Jesus is from Atlanta and He is Black. Enough said..."
5,South of Lafayette,"Given Artie Traum's recent series of wonderful instrumental albums, it's natural to forget how sophisticated his vocal and lyric-writing skills are. South of Lafayette is one of those magical albums that blend terrific playing, sensitive lyrics and compelling vocals. Whether you purchase music for its overall sound, or - like me - you listen for every lick and lyric in the headphones, this is a must-have CD."
3,A beginner's reference,I recommend this book to beginning users of Project Server because this book offers basic knowledge of--Installation and system requirements--Planning and set up a pilot project--Database structure and some customizationFor experienced user this is not a book for you because it lack of details in--Troubleshooting--Advanced usage--Integration with other systems
2,"This book is a collection of bad Help file, with snapshots","If all you want to know is the basic on what choice to make during the initial installation of Project Server 2002 then this book will do (and I mean the very basic). Beyond that, look somewhere else, anywhere else. This book take minimalism to a new low, one that ceases to be meaningful.Why is this book bad? Let me see...for one...it's not a book, just a collection of descriptions and snapshots... using bigger than usual font, inconsistent color, layout, and it's speadout to give the impression that there's more to it than meet the eyes. It's just aweful. The Help file in project server is infinitely better. What a joke. This is not a book, it's long pamphlet. Actually, it's not even a pamphlet, I am not sure what the hell it is?"
1,If I had only read the reviews...,"OK, so I should have looked further. This book is terrible. Most of the text can be found in the Microsoft documentation, which is disorganized and incomplte. All this book did was to put the documentation in order. If you really need some help, try Gary Chefetz' book."
2,Needs an editor and spellcheck,"Fully half of this book is Appendix 1 which is the table stucture. If that's what you need, go for it, it's a great resource. If you are hoping for anything else, wait until someone with an editor and spellcheck releases a book. This is essentially one person's notebook wrapped in a nice cover."
1,Project .....,This book is just cut and paste from Microsoft whitepapers and it is my understanding that Microsoft is suing him for infringement. You would be better off with Tim Pyron's book.
1,Plagiarism,"Copy & Paste job at its grandest. If you have Project Server 2002 already, just look at your README files, Help files, etc and you will see the book written by Qimao Zhang to be based entirely off it.The funny thing is - he didn't even try to reword the helpfile contents.I doubt he is from Microsoft as its not a Microsoft Press book. I wouldn't be surprised if he is being legally pursued by Microsoft.TIP: Don't buy the book. You are wasting your money."
2,Project Server Installation,"I waited what seemed forever before this book finally arrived, so perhaps my expectations had been building too long. I had already installed MSPS myself (with assistance from the online help), and wanted a book to guide me through final configuration and usage. Since I had installed MSPS and was already using the product, I had already done a good deal of trying things to see how they worked, and really wanted a book to tell me what to do with all of these spiffy features.This book is not exactly what I had expected, although it did give instructions for setting up the OLAP cube and some user rights settings that needed to be modified.The editor could have done a better job in reviewing the text, as it contains numerous grammar errors.I will probably look for another book to help me in using Project 2002 professional WITH MSPS so that I can use them both with confidence."
1,Dont't buy this book or you'll loose your money!,"A few words: I bought more than ten books about the new ""Project Server 2002"" system. Without any doubt, this is the awful book I bought, completely useless. More than an half of this book corresponds with the published Microsoft documentation you can find on the Project server 2002 CD!"
2,I'm sending it back,"If you're looking for a book on how to use Project Server, this is NOT the book for you. This book is how to install Project Server, and even then it is not a very good book. There are a lot of unnecessary, fuzzy screen shots, diagrams and technical stuff.I wouldn't recommend this book, but it's the only book dedicated to Project Server I can find."
1,I cannot believe I paid for this.,This is a terrible book. I don't need 80 pages of the installation which is in the readme file. The only good thing about it is the DB documentation in the back.
5,Great product as advertised!,The product arrived in excellent condition. Easy install with immediate performance observed! I highly recommend this product to entry level tuners.
3,Move To This!,"Was Pleasantly surprised upon hearing this album...the third for dance band Technotronic. I already knew of 'Move it to the Rhythm' with classic Ya Kid K vocals and expected an album of the same sort of tracks..well..wasn't i shocked to hear that although this album was PACKED with slammin' dance beats..there are some GREAT dance tracks on here featuring Daisy Dee and Black Diamond also..one track in particular..""Are you Ready"" featuring Daisy Dee on vocals has a very similar bassline to Motiv8's 'Rockin' for Myself'...one of my favourite dance songs EVER! Check out this album if you're a fan of 90's eurodance...as i am!"
2,Deflated,"I bought this CD specifically for Bill Evans ""Peace Piece"", and unfortunately, this arrangement sounds nothing like what I expected. Very somber recording, overall."
3,Not first quality,"I bought these plates to supplement the set I have at home because they've been discontinued, and I wanted to get some extras while I still could. They're passably good, but the imprint of the leaf in the center is noticably lighter than the ones on the set I already have and I suspect that they might be factory seconds or something. They're good enough that I'm glad I bought them since I couldn't find this size at the Corelle store at the nearby mall, but I was a little disappointed that they weren't quite top quality."
3,Too historically broad,"If you're looking for clues as to how Rehnquist will preside over the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton you'll be disappointed. In fact this book is more like a simple retelling of events than a focus on constitutional issues. Rehnquist does make the point that the acquittal of Justice Chase helped foster a judiciary independent of political litmus tests by Congress, and the acquittal of President Johnson did likewise for the executive branch, both of which Rehnquist feels are good things, but other than that you'll be hard pressed to find anything about the author's personal opinions. The narrative of the book is far too much concerned with broad historical developments which are discussed in much better detail in other sources, rather than focussing on the particulars of the impeachment trials. The material on the trials themselves probably takes up no more than a quarter of the book."
3,A good primer on American History.,I enjoyed this book. Its an excellent primer on both impeachment and American History. I recommend it for anyone whose looking for a good introduction or review of the history of our country from its founding through reconstruction.
5,I love this cd,"You have to hear this music. A friend told me about this band and now I'm completely addicted. I also love their cd entitled ingredients although I didn't see it on . Anyway, they are great and I know they offer free downloads on their web page ..."
5,Not really Bluegrass but good old-style country,"This isn't a bluegrass album in my opinion. Seeing the Skaggs Family label on the CD I was expecting much more bluegrass than I got. Don't expect Alison Krauss or any of the guys from Union Station here. This is much more like old-time country along the lines of Tift Merritt or some Allison Moorer. That said, it is great country. I am NOT a fan of the newfangled country and the pop stars that come from it. Melonie is much better than her buddy Kenny Chesney, who seems to be obsessed with beaches and booze. Mel describes herself as a country singer on the video on the CD and I have to agree. May she has great success in the future."
5,A Beautiful Christmas CD,"Vocalist John Berry brings new life to some old-time favorite Christmas songs on this wonderful cd. His melodic tenor voice gives a new dimension to these classic songs. From ""Joy to the World"" to ""O Come All Ye Faithful"", John takes the listener on a nostalgic trip with his versions of some of the classic songs of Christmas. The best song on this disc is the title track; ""O Holy Night"". This has always been one of my favorite Christmas songs, and John's version is one of the best I've heard.I highly recommend this great cd. I look forward to Christmas and being able to hear some great Christmas music each year. John Berry's great Christmas cd is a worthy addition to any Christmas music collection. Listen to this great disc and hear some truly beautiful Christmas songs with a very unique and memorable sound to them."
5,a christmas dream cd,john's amazing voice fits so well with these favorite christmas songs of mine. he has a way of making the meaning of songs come alive!
1,Poor Construction Quality,"This tripod felt frail and plastic-y to begin with. The first time I tried to extend the legs (carefully, as I could sense to danger in ordinary operation) a plastic piece broke off of its spot, so I could not properly adjust that leg. I will remedied this (sort of) by shoving the pieces back together, but they are apt to come apart easily.I do NOT RECOMMEND this tripod, even for the price. It's a serviceable stand if you really need it, but the construction is very poor. Look else where for a tripod for you camera's sake."
2,Not for a DSLR,"Good for small cameras or video recorders. Not real happy putting Nikon D40 on it. Would not use outside in wind. But hey, for 6 dollars, what can you say?"
1,Poor quality,"I wanted to replace my old tripod that I gave to my sister with this one. This seemed better in the pictures and had a good price, but when it arrived it was a total deception. It seems that is build with very bad materials, like if it will break no matter what you do.The caps at the end of the legs of the tripod just come off every time. Also there is no way the camera can be totally horizontal because the place where you put the camera has an inclination that doesn't allows it, no matter how creative you are adjusting all the hingers in the tripod. You cannot put your camera totally vertical either because the hinger doesn't allows you to.I returned it for a full refund."
3,I was very excited but,I got this shipped pretty quickly. However the first time I took it out to use it one of the legs doesn't stay extended. You touch it or put your camera on it and it starts falling over. Overall price is good but qaulity stinks. I didn't use it right away so I didn't think it would do any good to request a replacement
4,Great Tripod,"Bought this one because it was the cheapest of the lot when I was searching for the tripod - everything clicks into place well, the mount has a better level of 360 rotation than I thought it would. One downside would be once I get it down to the lowest height, sometimes it's a little difficult to pack up because it gets stiff but apart from that, great product :)"
2,Twice Broken,"So I was excited to get it the first time, it shipped fast =) It looked good, the crank was a bit annoying but with some tweaks I thought it'd work out... But as I tried to set it up the first time I noticed the clamp on one of the legs was broken, the piece of plastic at the top of the fastener was missing (floating in the packaging). =(I contacted the seller and they were amazing, they sent me a new one for free =) and said not to return the old one as it was not worth the cost of shipping.I just got the new one =( the same leg is broken, in the same place. I guess it'll just have to be a tabletop tripod. I'd contact the seller again, but I honestly don't think it's their fault, it's just a crappy product."
4,good value,"Good value for money, but dont expect a professional-grade tripod. The legs are thin, so the tripod isn't too sturdy. I would imagine a larger, professional video camera would tip it over. But if you are looking for something simple and light for your home camcorders, this will do."
4,Nice unit.,"Although this is a little heavier than what I would take on a hiking trip, it works great for everyday projects. I keep it in my vehicle so it is always within reach."
1,Head fell off,"The tripod head fell off literally the first time that I used it. There is no way to screw it back on. If I had had a camera on it it would have fallen right off and broken. Terrible quality, don't buy it. Seriously."
5,Great!,"It does it's job and for cheap! no problems with it so far, works like a charm.as long as you take care of it it should last you a long time. worth the money if you need a tripod asap."
3,"Not as good as expected, but the price was too low",I bought this tripod for my spotting scope because I didn't want to pay for something I would only use a couple times. I should have taken into consideration the hard use it would have to have but I went with the cheap and now need to buy a more well built one for my needs.
4,Good enough for the price.,"If you need a cheap tripod while you get a better one, this one is for you. If you need a good tripod, move along. It's very light, not very sturdy, it shakes when taking a picture, not stable, one piece broke only two weeks after purchase. If you're a professional, this one is NOT for you."
5,Very Good camera stand for the price!,I just wanted a basic cheap camera stand and this is the right product. I use it to record my workouts and it does it's job. The camera feels strongly secure once you put it on the stand.
3,Its ok,Ok the bubble level is good i used it for my videos i liked it but its cheap it broke on me when i was trying to extend it so it works for while but not the best
2,"Not convinced the product was ""NEW""","I would give the product a higher rating if I believed the tri-pod I received was ""NEW"". When I opened the package a noticed scrathes all over the aluminum legs and the plastic support on the top had wear and pressure marks. Not a happy customer."
1,Broke on first day.,Very cheap product. Clips were broken before we even tried to use it. Pick a more expensive product. You get what you pay for.
3,good for light duty,"i had a little bit of trouble when unboxing, the tripod is a little bit fragile, so you have to be very careful when using it.the first time i was using it, one of the parts broke.so, if you plan to use it frequently, you better find a more robust tripod."
1,Damaged out of box,"I was very excited to get this tripod. Cheap, light, perfect. But as soon as I took it out I noticed that one of the upper retention clips was snapped and would not hold the leg out. The construction is cheap and plastic. I did not assume it would be amazing based on the price but I was expecting more."
2,"Used to be good. New batch, no good.","I buy these for work in amounts of 20+ at a time.These used to be a good product, pretty reliable, sturdy units. But last shipments, even though all description and pictures stayed same. We got different units. And I know this for fact since we had previous order still in stock. It's much much smaller and no longer fits the spec.Seller either need to check their inventory and correct the mistake or if this is different unit with different specs, seller MUST repost using NEW specs. If seller can bring old spec tripods back, contact me, I'll buy more."
4,"Lightweight, easy to use","Doesn't seem terribly durable, but what do you expect for something made in china and sold at this price? It's compact, convenient, and lightweight. Comes with a carrying case, which is helpful. The quick release function is also very useful. Highly recommend for those videographers and photographers on a budget."
2,"Well, That sucks!!!","All excited when it came in the mail today. Set it up and one of the clamps that tightens and loosens the legs broke off. I can steady it with a rubber band though, but crap! that sucks! Besides that, it is pretty cool with a lot of great features and I will still get my use out of it!"
2,Its definatley not very good...,"So I went into buying this tripod knowing it wasn't going to be the best. But what i got definatley wasn't what I expected. It feels cheap and not very stable. When you put the camera (or atleast with mine) on it with the swivel stick facing you, the camera is always tilted, so the only way i can have it is with the swivel stick going to the side. If you are only shooting videos in your bedroom or outside, this tripod is fine, but don't expect to take it hiking and get the quality you think you should get out of it. But for what i do, which is film outside or inside, its ok...not the best but probaly not the worst. But if you want a good quality tripod, go for something a little more expensive or go to the store and actually try it out, then come back on here and order it if its cheaper."
2,Camera Tripod is too flimsy.,"Thought it would be better, but it is just too flimsy. Sets up quick, but support legs are too thin. I would buy a larger version next time."
3,Review,"The quality of the product seems to be alright; however, mine came with a broken leaver to raise the pole in the middle up and down."
2,It broke!,"I thought that this tripod was great when I first got it, it is lightweight, easy to adjust height, decent control. But while I was using my camera with it, the black top became ""unglued"" or whatever they used to seal the black top adjustment insert, broke off and dropped my expensive camera onto the ground, hard. My camera luckily fell onto my bag laying underneath, but I was furious. The tripod was barely used when this happened, and I had taken good care of it.If you're an amateur photographer who doesn't care about what happens to their camera, then a cheap thing like this will work for you. otherwise, it's better to invest money into something that is actually going to last."
1,Wrong.,"I purchased this tripod based-on written description and price, as well as the photo of said tripod. What came to my door was nothing like the photo. Nothing at all."
1,This is a suck stuff,"I just got this trash this morning, and it's totally suck ever.The part of foot was already broke.I don't understand why they don't take look for their product before senting product for customers??I never buy this product from this company!!!!!"
3,Over priced in my opinion,"Cheap feeling, holds the camera, doesn't move smoothly. Nothing more to say than ""It's a tripod."" A kid in Nicaragua stole mine."
1,"Dont walk away, RUN AWAY!!","I recieved my tripod about an hour ago, and its already broken. I dont know what its called but the lever that controls pointing the camera up and down wont tighten so the camera just swings all the way back. I was skeptical because some of the reviews painted it as a fair to decent item so i thought to myself that it would atleast give me a few good uses before it could break............NOPE!!! Breaks right away. Look elsewhere if you want something to put a real camera on. Maybe a digital camera that cost 20 dollars would work on it, but not a DSLR and yes my camera is BELOW the weight limit by about half. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
3,"VERY basic, but worth the price and not a dime more.","This is just a lightweight, basic tripod that you cannot expect much from. It suits my purpose as a travel pod. I do not feel confortable leaving my DSLR on it without hands close by. It is pretty stable with normal lens and quite wobbly with any of the zooms. Legs feels good, but plastic parts (anything black)is cheaply made. If you want a light backup or travel tripod that is very inexpensive, then this may work for you. The canvas bag is also nice to have and seems thick enough to last. If it was not for the hassle of shipping, I would likely return this and spend just a tad bit more for something a bit sturdier. I will keep it and use it for the small digital camcorder. That is light enough to work well with this unit."
1,terrible,"it literally fell apart within 5 minutes of opening the box and using it. the clamps broke, legs fell. please i urge you do not buy this!"
2,Plastic Pieces very breakable,I ordered 12 of these for a work project and 2 came broken. The black plastic piece that attaches the cross-supports to each leg from the center post was broken. And they are really flimsy. You get a cheap product at a cheap price.
3,Dissapointing,"I purchased this tripod because the price was too good to pass up. After using this tripod for several hundred pictures the tripod seems to have more cons than pros.The pros:Lightweight.Collapses to a small size for carrying.The cons:Unsteady.The top does not lay flat so I have to adjust the legs to compensate.Where the camera connects into the tripod doesn't seem to fit correctly so the camera has a lot of play.Even with screwing everything as tight as it goes the weight of the camera can easily move the mounts making pictures inconsistent.The biggest problem is the fact that the camera doesn't seem to sit solid on the tripod.I will be purchasing a new tripod soon, you really do get what you pay for."
3,Price equals quality,The product arrived in good condition.It is very inexpensive and will help me to carry easily.It seems a little weak.
2,Item Received was not as depicted in photo,"Item received from ""New Harbor"" was different than depicted in photo on Amazon. I thought I was buying the same item I had previously purchased that had a hollow handle. The item I received had a solid handle. Since I use the handle to create perches for my bird photography, the item I received is worthless to me. It's not worth the cost to pay for return shipping on a $15 item. Items should be accurately depicted!"
4,tiny but tough book,"Small books this size rarely lay flat. It would be essential to view poses and have the book lay flat. The binding is so thick and tough that you can literally stand on the book without fear of any damage what so-ever, and it stays that way. The page numbering is in the middle of the page which was a little aqward at first. Major flaw for advanced practitioners: the index uses the English terms for poses and then in parentheses the classical name. So you can't look up the pose using the Sanskrit name. Overall a nice book."
3,Tiny book,Good information. Poses are not easy to follow based on description. Pose variation are minimally useful. Book so small it was hard to read.
3,Alright,Most of the poses I cannot do because it goes unsidedown. It was great for what it was. Highly educational though
1,Takes forever to ship,"I actually have no complaints about the product. But that's probably because I haven't gotten it yet. I ordered it 8 days ago, and it has yet to even be shipped. Did anyone else have this problem? All in all, this is disappointing, because I've heard it is a wonderful book to have if one practices yoga.Please comment if you've had the same problem or have a way to contact the seller."
5,would love a better binding,"This book is wonderful - great pictures. Also info on more than just poses. But what I also like is that for each pose, the author tells you what poses to do as a preparation for the pose, and what the pose works on (such as strength). The print is rather small, as the book is not much more than 6""x6"", but it's loaded with info-- about 1.5"" worth, it's that thick! I think this book could be improved by making a spiral bound version with more of a hardback cover. That said, I've owned my copy for a couple of years and it has held up."
3,Ebook version is overflowing with typos,"I had this book assigned for one of my classes, so I really wasn't expecting to enjoy it at all. However, overall the book itself wasn't terrible. Lewis moves along through his life at a reasonable pace so it doesn't get boring, and his writing is usually easy to understand and isn't terribly dry. The ebook conversion, however is absolutely horribly done. By the end of my reading, I came to expect a typo on almost every page that I read, and they weren't at all easy to understand at times. Common errors included replacing ""He"" with ""Fie"" and ""A"" with ""4."" The only way I can fathom as to how this came about is that this was put into ebook format by scanning a printed version and then using some program to convert it to text instead of a picture. Ultimately, it was incredibly distracting and I really wished I'd just spent the extra money on the paperback book."
2,EDIT the kindle versions!!!,"I am 27% through this e-book and am enjoying the subject matter; however, there are numerous typographical error. I have already identified 13 errors, and those are just the ones that I have started flagging. There is at least one instance where the word intended is not even discernible - faidty instead of faulty! Since I have not read this book before, and without a well edited hard copy, for all I know there may be countless other errors typographical and grammatical. For $8.51 I expect a properly edited e-book, after all, they somehow manage to sell paperbacks for ~7.99 that are edited. Finally, while this is not the first poorly edited kindle edition I have encountered on Amazon, it is currently the worst. Skip this and buy a hard copy."
3,hard to read,The book was hard to read with a lot of referance to other authors and being a Irish writer his frasing was difficlut. I have 3 other of his books I bought at the same time and Im not interest in reading them Mable Nelson
2,Painfully dense slow-going read,"I was excited to read this, and ordered Mere Christianity as well. This one arrived first, and I settled in last night to read and was disappointed by the painfully slow pace. Every possible detail is included which makes for a very dull read. I found myself skimming whole chapters to get to the point, which doesn't really arrive until the end chapters.It does illustrate though how reading and writing styles have changed over the years. This type of writing used to be the standard, when people didn't mind a wandering narrative. I sometimes don't myself if what I'm reading is interesting, but this just didn't engage me.I'm hoping that Mere Christianity is better."
4,Very Inspiring,Encouraging book that really addresses that hopeless cycle you sometimes fell yourself in where you are constantly pursuing something that can't be attained.
3,A book Lewis could have done without,"My first exposure to C S Lewis was through The Screwtape Letters, which I found to be both absolutely engrossing and filled with insight of the highest order into society and human nature. I was also strongly captivated by the author's Narnia series of children's books, and I was ready to count myself a Lewis fan. But Lewis's non-fiction, although written with flair and clarity, proved disappointing. His penchant for allegory and metaphor makes his fiction great, but it undermines the logic of books like Mere Christianity and Miracles. And although Surprised by Joy is, like all of his books, very enjoyably written, it destroyed my former conception of Lewis by revealing how dependent his religious beliefs were on his own personality and emotional struggles. We must commend Lewis for not tidying up his image, but the effect of the book, for me, was to cast a veil of doubt over everything else he published."
2,Disappointing,"A disappointment, though not without interest. Lewis's purpose is to tell the story of his conversion from atheism to Christianity. But there is little here to challenge or even interest the open-minded atheist. It seems to me that Lewis converted largely for emotional reasons, apparently because he believed in some kind of Hegelian Absolute. The last two chapters are so vague and poetic (or perhaps poetically motivated...?) as to be very tough to read when trying to find out why he believes and what relevance his conversion might have to me. I never really got clear answers to these questions. Lewis is always readable, but this was disappointing on intellectual grounds (which is true of all his apologetics)."
3,An expository on Solipsism,"It seems sacrilegious to redact such a gifted writer whose phraseolgy make his prose almost poetic, but my patience wore thin as I listened via Books on Tape to all his self-absortive drivel awaiting the ""piece de resistance"" of the basis for his conversion. I was deeply disappointed in the short shift he accorded the latter. My iconoclastic opinion."
4,Only for fans,"If you're interested in learning more about C.S. Lewis and how he became what he was, then this is definitely the best source available, especially about his childhood years. I don't imagine this book would be too interesting to those who aren't already fans of Lewis, as his other works, especially fictional, are much better in my opinion.It is very interesting, though, to see how such a fervent atheist could go from arrogance to one of the twentieth century's greatest Christian apologists."
3,Interesting but not riveting.,"I find it interesting to read about C.S. Lewis' childhood, but it's not nearly as entertaining as the Narnia series. I guess I should have expected it to be more factual and less enjoyable."
3,Important Because of the Author,"C.S. Lewis helped bring me back from the brink of unbelief with ""Mere Christianity,"" and his other titles have nurtured my faith back to health. That said, I wasn't terribly impressed with his spiritual autobiography. This works spends a lot of time detailing his childhood in somewhat disjointed vignettes, and when his actual conversion to Christianity comes there isn't much detailed explanation as to what he found so compelling in Christianity.Still, as a fan of C.S. Lewis, I'm glad for the insight into his early spiritual life."
4,"A good biography, and a great look into the past","I enjoyed the book very much. It is always interesting to read about the childhood experiences of a person from a different era. Anyone that complains about school bullying today, should read this book."
2,Very Meh,"This is essentially Lewis' autobiography only up to the point of a small time after his conversion to Christ. I really wish he would have talked about his Narnia series at least a little bit and more than just a small paragraph on his friendship with Tolkien. As far as Lewis' story goes I can't really fault him on telling his life story, who can? The events that happened, happened. It seems though that Lewis attempts to be building up in certain areas of a general life lesson he wants to pass on but he doesn't quite seem to get there. Even when dealing with his conversion to Christ, it really only takes up the last three chapters and the book seems to abruptly end; something that I've seen Lewis do in other works. Overall, it's an ok biography but really for only someone who absolutely wants to know about Lewis' life before Christ. Pretty boring and slow paced for me. Overall grade - D+"
4,Pleasant and suprising at the end,"C.S. Lewis writes about his upbringing, his relationship with his father and brother, his schooling, and quite extensively comments on his passion for reading and absorbing more and more literature as his life unfolds. It isn't until the far latter portion of the book that the movement toward a belief in theism, and then quickly to Christianity, that his spiritual beliefs are explained in detail. But when it is - it is a refreshing read to those of us who are patient enough and curious enough to see how his position unfolds. Vocabulary on the more difficult side - I used a dictionary from time to time to attain better understanding."
3,Excellent book for the Lewis admirer,"The Lewis admirer will greatly appreciate this book and its depiction of the early life of this Christian genius. He describes his slow transformation from stanch athiest to devout Christian in the complicated simplicity that only Lewis can achieve. However, be weary of this book if you have never previously read Lewis. The development of the story is rather slow and lethargic and the non-Lewis fan may find it difficult to get through the early chapters. Yet, for the Lewis admirer the lax early chapters are well worth the culminating transformation in the late portion."
3,mixed feelings,"I bought this because Rob Zombie wrote the introduction and because David's a hometown boy. I'm definitely not disappointed with my purchase, but I'm a tattooer and I'm used to perfect renderings. Some of this guys stuff is awesome....some is just sloppy....so I guess the old adage is true....its not what you know, its who you know."
2,Huh?,"Let me start off by saying mysteries are my favorite types of books, and a good one will keep me up all night. The first half of this book was one of those can't put down thrillers..and then it sank like a rock, ending in a way that was completely implausable and ridiculous. I hope Cornwell's next offerings are back up to par."
2,"Too many holes in plot/is Scarpetta God,too?","As a scuba diver, I was eagerly awaiting this book. I had read Cornwell actually took up diving to research it. But there were just too many inacuracies to make it enjoyable. Why was she at a cottage with her dive gear - and no buddy? Who said the body that was found in the water had been diving? etc. Also, with all the politics and the government involved, I found it hard to believe a medical examiner would have been allowed to almost run the show. Still, I always do enjoy a Kay Scarpetta novel but this was the most disappointing one yet."
2,I'm rapidly losing interest in Kay Scarpetta.,"Scarpetta seems to have become an action-adventure character. I liked her better when she was just a medical examiner for the city of Richmond and not a pseudo FBI agent. The story line of Lucy's heroics as T.H.E. FBI girl-wonder of computers is far-fetched and getting tiresome. Let's get out of the FBI biz and dump Benton, please! Marino's great and the complex relationship with Lucy is fine. But the hands-on crime fighting is just getting downright stupid. I thought the story began well enough, but once Kay and Lucy donned their masks and capes and headed for the Batmobile, I became bored. The ending was rushed, but to be honest, considering my boredom at that point, not rushed enough"
2,Boredom was the cause of death,"This book started out with a lot of promise, but ended with little fulfillment. We aimlessly wander through a series of improbable events, with no proof of their connection (only a bunch of postulations offered by Scarpetta, Marino and their FBI pals). In the end, we don't really know who committed the murder that kicked the whole thing off, which was very dissappointing to me. I think Patricia Cornwell must have felt compelled by her editor to put out a book, whether or not she really had one that year."
5,Cause of Death,Wow! Suspensed; I finished this book in 3 days. Kay Scarpetta is as good as ever. Thanks for the great read.
5,Patricia Cornwell,"I really enjoy her books; so far, I've liked all of them. She is a very good medical suspense writer, with a great deal of knowledge and information. Her descriptions, language and ability to set a scene are top notch.I would recommend any of her books all the time!"
2,Trudging thru,I read a few of the Scarpetta books before I realized they are in a series so I decided to read them in order. Some parts of the books when she gets technical are a little painful but easy to skim by but this whole book is painful. I am trudging thru for the background plot of the series not for the plot of this book. I am 3/4 of the way thru and I am hoping it comes to a speedy end.
2,"ending too abrupt, doesn't relate to rest of book","About 90% of this book is good. But the ending fails to tie together any of the loose ends (and they are numerous) of the book and Dr. Scarpetta is barely helped by any of the knowledge she gained in the previous 300 pages. The interaction between her and the ""bad guys"" at the end is straight from an action movie where plot does not matter. No discussions, no negotiations, just a straight, self-contained deception that could have come out of any 2-star action movie. Numerous characters are left hanging after the beginning and you wonder what happened to them because, although they are mentioned, you never find out what happened to them and they don't appear in the rest of the story. Thoroughly disappointing. A 4-star story idea brought down two notches by a bad ending and general sloppiness. Did I mention that the book had a bad ending?"
2,Super ME flies again.,"""PostMortem"" introduced a facinating and very human character. Dr. Kay Scarpetta matured through the next two novels. Then she began to become more super-human with each novel. ""Cause of Death"" has her single-handedly saving Virginia from nuclear holocaust at the hands of the most ill-defined terrorist group imaginable. Marino is the only character is this book that breathes, and he is congested. Please go back to human characters, Ms. Cornwell."
3,Cause of Death,"As far as this being one of Cornwell's best books, it would not qualify. The book started off too abruptly and didnt give as much detailed background as it should have. In the beginning it introduced us to a mysterious death. There was a peson killed on a dock. Dr Skarpetta was the person in charge of investigating this crime. It goes on and on about this, not really introducing any new material. This made the book less attention grabbing. The same happened over and over throughout the book, and really didnt feel like we were getting anywhere. The only thing that gave it a weird feeling was the fact that it took place on New Years Eve. Normally Cornwell keeps you wanting to read the next page, Cause of Death just didnt cut it. Dont take this, as if she writes bad books, since most of hers that I have read were excellent. I just wouldnt go out and get this one until you have read some of her others."
3,Not to bad,"As I continue to read Patricia Cornwell's novels, I find myself more intrigued with the characters than the story line."
1,A boring read with little suspense,"This is obviously Ms.Cornwell's weakest story and by far the least suspenseful. The dialogue is trite and the relationships ""old"". It is more an expose on alternative lifestyles. I certainly hope the author can refresh herself next ""go around"""
2,Starts off OK - Miserable read during the second half...,"I am an avid fan of all kinds of mystery books - and a good friend of mine recommended Patricia Cornwell. For some odd reason I always thought she was a romance novelist...must be the name.Well, the book is truly dissappointing. The first half or so is allright - standard fare mystery writing. The second half and especially the ending is so unconvincing and utterly boring - I almost did not have the strength to finish the book. The most annoying part of the book is Dr. Scarpetta's constant bragging about her ""luxurious Mercedes"" and status as the district medical examiner or whatever she is.This is definitely the last Cornwell novel I read and I would recommend any mystery fan to keep his or her hands off this title."
2,Pretty darn dreary,"I hated this book. The plot was ridiculous, Dr. Scarpetta isjust SO self righteous, and her overprotectiveness of Lucy nauseating.The kid's in the FBI now for crying out loud.I've read many of PC's books, and what has really bothered me lately is that her writing has also gotten increasingly clumsy, as if she's just going through the motions. Case in point, this paragraph about Scarpetta and Wesley, ""We made love because we could not help ourselves. That was our only excuse, and would hold up in no court I knew. Separation had been very hard, so we were hungry with each other all night."" CORNY. Sound like something out of a highschool creative writing class. And this is only one example of the smarmy stuff in this novel."
1,Slips Ahoy!,A general in the Navy? Almost as believable as a 23-yr. old genius with an attitude who is the FBI's secret weapon. This book read as though Ms. Cornwall phoned it in.
1,Bad Plot caused the death of this book,"I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is by far the WORST Scarpetta novel I have read. I thought the story began well enough, but it went down hill fast. The plot was completely implausible & ridiculous.Dr Scarpetta is involved w/ a global nuclear disaster involving foreign powers. I just find it hard to believe the chief medical examiner from Virginia would be involved (& basically runs the show) when there is a nuclear crisis looming.Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Having to hear Scarpetta brag endlessly about her Mercedes got beyond old.The only positive thing in this bk. is Marino. This book should only be read for die hard fans."
3,Not a good one to read as your first Cornwell experience...,"When investigative reporter Ted Eddingds is found dead in the Elizabeth River, Dr. Kay Scarpetta is filling in as the cheif medical examiner in the Tidewater area. Everything about this case is puzzling and she is certain her presence there is not appreciated. This is an excellent start to the book, however the plot quickly changes as Dr. Scarpetta returns to Richmond. Soon after, the death of her Tidewater assistant occurs in Richmond and she is quickly called to the scene of the murder. It takes over 200 pages for this story to begin to pull together, so for most of the book you are left wondering why the you are given all of these random bits of information. If you make it through, you will find out that it is all fairly relevant, and what does come together is a very complex and thouroughly researched mystery."
3,Farfetched,"This is the weakest of Ms. Cornwell's books that I have read so far. Kay, staying at a colleague's residence, receives an anoymous call regarding a death. The coincidences and implausibility chains go downhill from there. Ms. Cornwell appears to be trying too hard, including elements of the occult, bioterrorism, serial murder, and questions of morality and ethics into a murky stew.The redeeming aspect is Lucy, who is coming into her own as an adult with her own life and projects. Kay, like any parental figure, is having to change her view of her niece from child to adult, and struggling with the transition."
2,Cause of Death,Avoid at all costs! I would love to never have to read another page of conversation between Lucy and Kay. It drove me crazy and was endlessly irritating. I also have a hard time believing in a main character who committed affairs with married men. How am i ever supposed to believe what she says after that? Marino was cool and funny too. He is the only character worth anything in the story. The first half of the book was great and built up nicely. But the second half of the book was horrible and it has one of the worst endings in the history of books. It left me laughing it was so bad.
1,Boring..,"This was my first (and last) book by Patricia Cornwell. I picked it up at the suggestion of another customer at the book store and I'm sorry I did. My mom read this book first and when it took her almost two weeks to finish I knew it wasn't good. I didn't even get half way through before I gave up. My mom is far stronger than I and will see a book till the end no matter how bad it is. I must agree with other reviewers, there's no plot and it's truly predictable.And to quote another reviewer:""I like to be challenged by a story, not to be fed a pointless story because she had to write 'x' many books to fulfill a publisher's contract. This is what this book is, no less, no more.""Avoid being bored to death. Don't buy this book."
2,predictable and unworthy of her caliber of writing,"I was very disappointed with Cause of Death. Her plots are good. I always enjoy her fascinatingdetails when describing Kay's methods of tracking down a serial killer or detecting a foreign substance on a minute piece of lint. However, this book left me disappointed and frustrated by it's too quick ending and lack of development of some of the characters. It seems to me that after a novelist signs the BIG DEAL, they write only for the money and the publisher and forget about writing for their readers. When that happens I forget to read their latest novel."
1,One must now question The New York Times review process,"A New York Times best seller? After reading this book, I will not use The New York Times as a reference when purchasing a book in the future"
4,Great Mysteries Wasted on Perrell Types,"Perrell loves to write what he thinks are literate reviews of fine books and in the process reveal his stupidity to us all (see pathetic stab at reviewing below). Too bad he still moves his lips when he reads. Please, Perrell, stick to the Hardy Boys and let adults enjoy Cornwell for the superb talent she is"
1,Last Precient Was the last GOOD Scarpetta,"Once Cornwell stopped writing the Scarpetta novels in first person, they have gone completely downhill. NOW if you read the earlier novels, they are GREAT. Point of Origin.. my personal favorite"
5,Cause of Death by Patricia Cornwell,Every Cornwell book is excellent and this one is no exception. If you like James Paterson you will love Patricia Cornwell.
1,"Important things happen ""offline""","What is it with this writer? All of the important things happen off line. At the start of this series KS is a hard drinking, smoking, kicking a*s and taking names character. All of the sudden she shuns red meat, doesn't smoke, cuts back on her drinking...this is a hugh change and why??? PC readers will never know. She never demos any major reasons for these changes. Another thing, Mark dies ""off line"". Is PC too lazy to write these emotionally charged changes? Kat"
1,I was very disappointed with the book.,"I was given this book as a gift and was thrilled to receive it as I had read the first four books written by Ms. Cornwell. I still remember the chills I felt as she confronted evil and used her brilliant mind and training to thwart the ""bad guys."" After reading this book, well I am glad that I did not purchase it with my own hard earned cash. My impression was that she either had this idea in a trunk somewhere and had to make a deadline or that she was trying to cash in on recent terrorist events, gulling unsuspecting buyers with a dust jacket blurb reeking of terrorism. I hope that this is that one bad book this particular author has in her. I'll hope that perhaps she will learn of the comments we have expressed and terrorize us with her next novel. When a favorite author disappoints, we feel betrayed. I hope Ms. Cornwell understands that and knows that we all await her next book, hoping for a winner, for her sake and ours"
2,Dr. Kay Scarpetta goes nuclear - but you have to ask why?,"A slow start, with a confusing mix of facts and emotionsthroughout the middle. The book focuses on the darkemotional stuggles of Scarpetta, and this unfortunately takesaway from the main plot. The ending offers a lukewarm finish,with a less than plausible outcome. Lucy grows up, but isstill sheltered by her aunt. Compared to many authors, stilla good book. Compared to other Patricia Cornwell books, aless than satisfying read."
3,Not as good as her previous books!,"I look forward to her books because she IS an excellent writer, but this one was somewhat of a disapointment! I think the subject matter was not what I expected from one of her books"
2,Another masterpiece by ace story-teller Patricia Cornwell,The death of a reporter throws Dr Kay Scarpetta into a whirlwind of activities - leading to an explosive climax. Classic Patricia Cornwell story-telling and probably the first time the reader gets to see a much more mature and somewhat cocky and arrogant Scarpetta. The hardening of her character may be essential for the character's development but could alienate readers though. Patricia Cornwell must guard against that ! Readers will know what I mean if they read this book
2,Patricia's Big Size,My paperback library consists of over 300 books. All of them are the same height EXCEPT FOR ONE. Patricia Cornwell's paperbacks have all grown 3/4 of an inch and don't fit in my specially-made bookcases.I really like character Kay Scarpetta and Patricia Cornwell and I am really sorry to see these books disappear from my shelves.
1,Boring,"My first Patricia Cornwell book. Now, it's my last Patricia Cornwell book. I finished it only because I had invested time in it. No suspense, no intrigue.Character interaction is silly. Somehow, it never seems to bother Lucy that her aunt (Dr Scarpetta) keeps showing up at her apartment, office and field job because she's ""worried about her"". For an FBI agent, Lucy's got no stones.I should have read the reviews here prior to reading this rag."
1,Cause of boredom,"I picked up where I left off reading the whole Scarpetta series after a 5 year break with this and wish I didn't. Because of this title, I have decided not to proceed with the other subsequent titles. I am also finished with this but I just skimmed most of the pages towards the end because it is horrible. The plot, the prose, the characterization - it is not up to par. Overall, it is a boring book even for the fans."
2,could have been better,"I got this as an audiobook. I wasn't impressed. This was my first novel of Cornwell's to read. I quickly picked up a pattern. With few exceptions the male characters were bumbling and if not dumb at the least not perceptive. But the female characters were smart, perceptive, and ingenious. Give me a break. The chief character, Kay Scarpetta, appears to be a smug, elitist character who acts like she is much smarter than others. I can almost see her pointing her nose down at people. Very snobby type main character in my opinion. This plus a stereotypical view of men makes it unapealling."
3,Alittle Jumpy,"I thought this book started out really great and then went down hill from there. When I started reading this I thought it was going to be another fun who dunnit book, but boy was I way off. It was very thoughtful deep mystery which must have taken alot of research to write about all the nuclear happenings in this book. Overall as with all the other books I like Lucy and the interactions she has with all the characters. Not one of my favorites but not the worse one also."
1,Does no one edit these things?,"This was the last Cornwell book I read; I'll read no more. Can you identify a flag-rank officer in the United States Navy? Patricia Cornwell can't. Cause of Death features just such a dignitary, rejoicing in the rank of ""General."" That's when I put the book down.There was a day in which human beings, employed by book publishers, actually examined what they were sending to the printer. At least for books with name-brand authors on the cover, those days are gone."
2,"Fast start, then fizzled","I agree with many of the other reviews - it showed promise in the beginning. I read the first 2/3's of the book in a day. I enjoyed the initial action and mystery. By the end, however, the book had fizzled to the point that I hard to force myself to finish it. Dr. Scarpetta is a thoroughly unbelievable character - she's an ""expert"" on everything from medicine to firearms to scuba diving to nuclear power plants! I'm a big Clive Cussler fan, and my wife bought this for me because of the scuba diver on the cover. Don't let that fool you - the diving aspect is a very minor part to the book (although it was one of the more exciting, at least for me). Bottom line- I wouldn't waste my time with this one again."
2,Don't start on Cornwell with this novel...,"You can't start reading the Scarpetta novels in the middle, you have to start with the very first one and work your way through. This is in the middle, with characters already developed, and it is very difficult to like them if you start with Cause of Death. While I agree this is not her best work, and I REALLY wish she'd kill off the niece, Lucy, she really is a good suspense writer. SUSPENSE, not mystery. There is a difference in that in suspense you often know who the bad guy is, and the suspense is finding out what happens next. I would suggest The Body Farm and From Potter's Field as a couple of good ones."
2,Not a good read,"Sorry Ms. Cornwell but this is not one of your better efforts. In fact, it reads like a first novel - too much insipid dialogue. Little more to say. I give it 2 because I finished it - barely."
3,Her weakest medically and factually,Not much research here. Lacks the medical insights that make previous efforts so enjoyable. Too much time spent on relationships. PC really needs a proof reader to catch obvious errors like Generals in the Navy - should be a no-brainer
2,Very slow - definately not her best.,"I've read all of her books thus far and was looking forward to another of the same high quality, engulfing storytelling.This book did not get started until the last hundred or so pages. Her first was much better - although I expected more I'm still a fan"
3,Definitely not as good as previous novels.,"Cornwell should stick with the sure fire hits like Body Farm andFrom Potters Field. This book is too far fetched. Whathappened to gritty murder mysteries? Dr. Scarpetta is bettertrying to find killers, motives, and evidence in the field thansolving nuclear situations. Leave that for the other FBIguys. Stick with old favorites."
1,Disappointing and unreal,"This book is very disappointing and unreal. The characters are hollow, and the plot is totally unbelievable. There is a Branch Davidian cult taking over the world, the invasion of a nuclear power plant and then if that's not enough Middle Eastern terrorists, and they call in Scarpetta to solve this? Come on. Also, Generals in the Navy? (there are no Generals in the Navy). Then of course Lucy is back, who seems to get more arrogant and unlikable in each book. As in previous books she's still angry and always sulking and in a bad mood. This is my 7th Scarpetta novel, and it might be my last. The characters are becoming irritating and tiresome, especially Lucy, (get rid of her or give her a better attitude). I also found myself getting fed up with Scarpetta's attitude toward Wesley. In real life he wouldn't put up with her. She's always TIRED and/or upset/angry. She needs a vacation! I got the feeling this was thrown together in a hurry without a lot of thought!"
2,Never write about things you don't understand!,"I've yet to see a movie or read any fiction involving a nuclear power plant that was anything but silly. Writers: just don't go there if you don't know what you're talking about! Now, the forensic stuff in Patricia Cornwell's books is fascinating. She knows that field very well, but the power plant thing was an idea best forgotten. It shot the whole climax into total silliness for me. Granted, I have the advantage of having worked in a nuclear plant for 16 years and not everyone has that. The plot probably worked ok for most people, but for me, it was a serious blow to credibility."
1,I plodded through,"I have to agree with the Booklist review of this book, and with CarriDiva. This amazing Wonder Woman of a medical examiner. With an even more amazing niece, who has accomplished so much in her long life of 23 years, it sounds like she has practically redesigned the FBI with her innovative creations. I could see all caps every time she referred to MY MERCEDES, I was so glad when she traded it.Anyway, I plodded through the book. That is the best I can say about it."
2,A little formulaic and anticlimactic,"This thriller, despite some good parts in the first half, petered out toward the end as it opted for rather clicheed set pieces. The ending was way too abrupt, like some Hollywood movies. The ending did not require enough sleuthing and was basically a no-brainer. Couple of good recipe ideas in it though, seriously. This was my first Scarpetta mystery and this writer certainly has promise...perhaps some of her later books could be really satisfying."
3,Boring!,"I didn't like it. Actually, it is not that bad, but the characters and the story are very uninteresting. In addition, a lot of details made me skip pages and pages. The end was very bad too!"
4,Excellent,"This is a good book but in my opinion not her best! It is a bit unrealistic when Dr Kay Scarpetta finds herself in the middle of a nuclear disaster. This I thought was totally unlike the style that Cornwell usually uses. All I can say is carry on writing more wonderful, exciting books. ( these books have inspired me to become a forensic pathologist.)"
2,Did a pod take over Ms. Cornwell? Who wrote this book?,"I'm reading all the books (in order) and can hardly believe this is written by the same author. The characters are familiar; Lucy is still annoying, Marino is still the only ""real"" person, and Benton is as stiff as ever (what is the attraction?)This is a book I'm reading just to ""get to the end of it."" The story line is week, the plot is silly, and Dr. Scarpetta's involvement is just plain implausible. I mean, really? The FBI and international intelligence community is sharing information with the Chief Medical Examiner from Virginia when there is a nuclear crisis looming? Don't other CME's get jealous? What was Ms. Cornwell thinking?I miss the forensic detective work and the writing of her previous novels that kept me on the edge. Resurrect Temple Gault for goodness sake! That would be a story."
2,"Bleh, sigh, ugh","Well, I love listening to books on CD during my commute. Frankly, I can't decide after 4 of the 10 CDs included in this package whether I should continue to listen or not. The reader's voice -- C.J. Critt -- is really irritating. Her inflection on certain words doesn't work and the voices she uses for some of the characters are so off-putting. After being almost halfway through, I really would like to know what happened to this AP reporter/scuba diver, but I'm not sure I can handle sitting through 6 more CDs. The whole story seems amateurish, and I agree with another reviewer who said that the know-it-all aspect of the protagonist is tedious. Let's just say I wouldn't recommend it. This is the first book I've picked up from Cornwell, and I probably won't pick up any others."
2,Cause of Death: Weak ending.,"Good beginning, a lot of distracting characterizations in the middle, and Cornwell's affliction for bad endings caused the death of this book."
2,Cornwell has gotten all too predictable.,"This book has convinced me to give up on Patricia Cornwell altogether. I loved her first two books, but the books after that have fallen into a predictable pattern and no longer interest me at all. What I most dislike about these books (and, unfortunately, this goes back to her earlier ones also--even though it didn't bother me as much then) is the way the female sleuth ALWAYS gets into danger herself toward the end of the book. I find this problem with most mystery or thriller writers who use a female lead character. Why is it that a woman problem solver cannot crack a case without putting herself in mortal fear? No more Cornwell for me"
2,It's time for Kay Skarpetta to grow up,"Once again, Dr. Kay Scarpetta in knee-deep in the poop. This time it's a far right militia group out to take over a nuclear power plant. This reviewer has read all of Ms. Cornwell's novels and I find that I am growing weary of Dr. Scarpetta's bellyaching and worrying about things in general and her niece in particular. It seems that somewhere along the way, Ms. Cornwell's character has stopped being a very strong woman and is beginning to turn into a self-pitying dishrag. When I read her first novel, ""A Time for Remembering,"" I couldn't wait for the next. Now, I'm not so sure I want to waste some very hard earned money for the novel following this, although I did buy ""Hornet's Nest,"" something I pray I'm not sorry for.In conclusion, unless you are a die-hard fan of Patricia Cornwell's, I'd suggest you pass this novel for something else, say Sue Grafton's ""M is for Malice.""Ross G. Homer"
2,This Cornwell book is a byproduct of the author's own angst.,This latest in the list of Patricia Cornwell's forensic pathologythriller series was a major disappointment. I feel that itwas used as a vehicle for this author to explore herown confusion over sexual identity -- and projectingit onto Lucy. The author shouldget back to the basics that made her novels eagerlyanticipated -- the cutting edge psychological thrillerwith the strong female protagonist! Give up the romance(or get her married off to the lover now that wifeyis out of the picture)and the finding of self and the good guy reformed Marino.I want her back --- come back Kay.Maybe a new character now that Kay has wimped out aftersaving us all from nuclear immolation.
2,"Unbelievable second half,ME involved in more than ""Quincy""","I had read her last book and was going to read all her books when Cause of Death came out. This book was terrible compared to the last book. Who was it that killed the people who died, who cares about her neice's life style. Did that add anything to the book. How is a medical examiner allowed to get into all the things she gets involved in.I would not now go back and spend the time or money to read her past stories. This book was a big dissapointment."
2,below par,"OK, sweet little Lucy is gay, mom is sick and Dr. Kay's sister hates her. We all know that, lets get over the poor me, poor me stuff and get back to murder, clues, hidden agendas and medical examiner investigations.. We all have crazy familys! I did not enjoy this book as much as some of the other ones"
4,Bad Title - Good Book- Title should be From the Beginning,"I have completed beginning and advanced Inventor classes using this book. I have held an A average with very little confusion of how to use the knowledge from this book. It covers all the most necessary topics, detailed enough for me and all of my classmates to master."
5,Passionate Politicians,This collection of correspondence between Pound and Cutting gives insight into the FDR era and the creativity that pervades it. Drs. Walkiewicz and Witemeyer should be commended for their meticulous research into the scene and political movements that still affect America today. One can not overlook the power of personality and friendships. Allegiances were so strong that formal political connections pale in comparison to the effect Pound had on the day.
3,Faye Dunaway paints an impressionistic painting of her life,"First of all, let me say that as ""celebrity biographies"" go, this is one of the better ones. Rather than produce a mere catalogue of people, places, and events, Faye Dunaway gives her readers impressionistic peeks into her life; her words are used like water-colored pastels to create a pleasing but not too controversial work. Although she overemphasizes pop-psychology explanations, Faye Dunaway still manages to bring her readers closer to Faye Dunaway the Woman and the Actress while chipping away at Faye Dunaway the Icon. It's a nice compliment to her work on film."
2,Texas! Trilogy,"Not in as good condition as I expected. No cover. Just an older copy than I thought I was ordering, but otherwise OK service."
3,Lacking in excitment,"I love books that are family sagas...this was disappointing. It was predictable, boring and lacked a 'hook'. This is the first time I have read Sandra Brown and will probably be the last."
4,Baltimore has talent!,"I was first exposed to Mia Miata's Urban Arias. Urban Arias was very impressive I must say! Now, I heard Fertile Ground's ""Black Is"" and I was indeed impressed by the independent level of talent that comes from Baltimore.Baltimore is a musical mecca for very talented folks!"
4,Good,"The show is really funny, I like a lot, but Warner Bros do DVD's in such rush that is no special features, extras, not even closed caption. I mean... Come on!!! Friends have little (almost nothing) of features, but Joey has nothing-nothing!! Seinfeld (Columbia Tristar) in other hand have everything you can possible imagine on DVD. That was just my though about Warner Bros. Buy the show if you want laugh, you won't regret."
2,Could It Be Any More Sad ?,"I was hoping for Mr. LeBlanc that his new show would be amazingly well written and acted, but from the start, in my opinion, anyway, the writers went way off track. Starting with the sets, everyone knows they are on a soundstage, but you can often forget that fact and "" feel "" at home. Not so with this - it looked and felt very staged. The acting was forced and seemedexxaggerated to the point of just wishing someone would shoot the characters and put them out of their misery, including JoeyTribbiani. The writing also seemed to be re-hashing Sitcom situations from Writing 101. That's a shame. They took a character, which could have sustained a run and overdid him, overdid it all and yet left the viewer feeling somewhat under - impressed and definitely NOT entertained. Frasier did it right for a number of years and I am sorry Joey didn't make it. It could have been a great ride."
1,"It can call Joey, but he'll never be the ""Friends"" Joey...","Maybe in Friends, Joey was the dumb but still funny and adorable character, and he was like a complement to all the jokes and stuff the characters in Friends said, but now, I think he can't do a show on his own, he's not the same and it's just not as funny as he was in ""Friends"", and I think he'll never be.The producers tried to do something to >""continue"" with Friends, but in the end, I think they did something worse."
2,This is not about the show. Its about the packaging of DVDs!,"I Don't want to discuss about the show itself, average or good, everyone who got the Friends entire series must have it for his/her collection. But... its not one of those quality products of Warner bros. Apparently they have switched to use slim cases instead of fix glass cases to reduce production cost. and one of the surprises which I saw for the first time on a Warner DVD, it has no English subtitles, only Spanish & French which make it less usable for huge amount of american people and most of international users.I Saw an import version with 3 discs. each disc in american release has average of 5 GBs of data but a dual layer DVD has a capacity of 8. so, they could produce 3 discs instead of 4 and spent the extra money to make a standard case. There is no extra features too! I really dissapointed about the quality of this product."
4,"Underrated show, especially if you're just looking for a laugh.","Despite the average ratings produced by the sitcom, ""Joey"" is a a surprisingly funny show. Matt LeBlanc is great in his reprisal role of Hollywood wanna-be Joey Tribbiani, and if you take the show on its own merits you'll be pleasantly surprised.Don't make the mistake of comparing this show to the original ""Friends"" because it just doesn't stack up, and that kind of comparison is just unfair. The supporting cast doesn't measure up, and this show is about Joey, not an ensemble of six. However, if you're looking for a few cheap laughs or if Joey has always been your favorite ""Friend"" than be sure to pick up a copy of this show as soon as it hits the shelves. I know I will.Oh and by the way, ""How you doin?"""
3,The first season wasn't so bad.,"I'd pick this one up. Used. For less than twenty bucks. The first two thirds of this season was pretty good. But then the ratings went in the pooper, the suits got desperate, and the plots got more and more outlandish, eventually to the point of unwatchability. Maybe it would have survived if they network would have let it ride out, but that's network TV nowadays. Instant success or nothing."
3,"i wanted to like it but it just didn't grab me,but my wife loves it","the three stars is from my wife,she loves the show,and try as i do i just can't get into the show.leblanc is very good as joey but he's not able to hold the show by himself(yes he has a great cast with him)! with that problem the show just doesn't work that well."
5,This book appeals to wine makers as well as enthusiasts.,"While this book will appeal to a broad audience of wine lovers, it will also have a special appeal to a narrower audience of wine makers. I count myself in both categories, so I'll offer two examples of this fine book's appeal: As a wine enthusiast, I discovered that New Zealand and South Africa are making wonderful Sauvignon Blanc. As a winemaker, I learned more about how Bordeaux winemakers derive the classic balance between approachable flavor and aging potential; and how the Australians use barrel fermentation of red wines to tame the assertive characteristics of their Shiraz. This is a MUST read for oenophiles!"
4,Lovely coffee-table book,"This is a coffee-table book, but a very good one indeed, in largish format with glossy paper, excellent color photography, and Johnson's workmanlike prose as he interviews some of the greatest wine makers around the world"
4,Not merely a coffee-table book,"I bought this book as a companion volume to my little home winemaking library and am very glad I did. The authors explain and illustrate very clearly the choices that winemakers make in response to, and to complement, what nature gives them: The Grape. Four stars because of the exclusive focus on ""great"" wines (far too expensive for you and I), which as Johnson freely admits, are as much a product of mystique, fame, and rarity as of winemaking practice. Also, the authors' constant fawning over everything French at the expense of the rest of the world lessens the book's value to someone interested in winemaking in California. Still, beautiful photography combined with clear illustrations and excellent, sharp writing make this a must read for the serious winelover interested in more than snobbery, or the amateur winemaker intent on improving his/her closet-full of cab."
2,SATA Blue Ray,"I purchased a SATA blue ray for my MacPro 3.1 before I realized that it was an IDE interface. Searched around and found this. Plugged it in and it works the drive shows up and plays DVD's no problem. I could not, however, get it to write to DVD or blu-ray. I returned this and ended up using the extra SATA ports on the mother board and that works much better."
5,Works as advertised,Product used to add a SATA drive to an old EDI motherboard and it all works great.
4,Works well,"I used it to replace a failing Series3 Tivo hard drive (with InstantCake) and it worked great. The power connection seems a little flimsy, so be careful."
3,"reduce, reuse, recycle","What a great invention! When you have Frankenstein hardware like I do, you may need an adapter here or there. I like to put old machines to work. This worked right out of the box and needs no cables or extra pieces. As far as I can tell, it doesn't bottleneck the speed of the drive too much either. I only have one problem: there is a jumper on the unit like on any non-SATA drive (6 pin, or three pairs) ... the documentation shows only 4 and there is no text on the board (like ""CS"" for cable select) to make it intuitive. There is a number on the paper I'm calling today, hopefully they can explain it.The drive drops off the system sometimes, but that was a symptom I was having before with ATAPI drives, so it's probably just that this Addonics adapter is on the wrong jumper."
2,OK but not very strudy,"the connection to the SATA card do not connect firmley. Depending on your configuration, the new drive with this adapter may make it too tall. I can't have my on/off switch connected because the card impedes the use of the switch. Need to get a different cable. It works, but it's not sturdy and not perfect."
3,IDE or SATA Adaptor,Purchased the Addonics SATA/IDE Adaptor. It was easy to plug in an came with the power adaptor (so I did not have to buy one - even though I did.) I am assuming it is this adaptor that seems to only find the hard drive half the time. I have to reboot a second time almost each time I log onto the computer.
3,Works,"Simple product, works correctly but easy to bend the little connectors - luckily I could bend them back without breaking them."
3,"Extremely slow, is it just me?","I bought this a year ago and installed it on a large hard drive I was putting in a different enclosure. I was swapping out enclosures with power bricks for enclosures with built-in power supplies. I had forgotten this one drive was SATA, not IDE, so I ended up needing this adapter. I had not used the drive until just recently when I had the need to troubleshoot a problem with my work Mac. To my dismay, I'm finding that the drive takes about 10 times longer to do anything than it should. According to the reviews I've read, no one else seems to be having a problem with it being THAT slow. If anyone reading this has any idea why this would happen, I would greatly appreciate a comment. Are there DIP switches somewhere I need to set, on the SATA drive or adapter? Software settings on the Mac?Meanwhile, fortunately I have kept the old enclosure and plan to put the drive back in it (if it still works) and see if there is a speed increase."
4,I GUESS IT'S OKAY...BUT....,"when i read in some of the reviews that it wasn't working, i figured that they didn't know how to install it. however, i have an adequate knowledge of computers and this thing was temperamental with me also. i decided to fore go installing it on my ide drive computer and just install the WD hard drive i bought with it on another (sata) computer as a slave. i couldn't in all honestly give it a five star because I'm not using it. but i couldn't give it a lower rating because i could see how it could work as a stand-alone drive. on the ide computer, i was going to make the sata a slave also. so, it couldn't meet my needs.it is also flimsy and easily loosened."
5,sweet,This is a great cd for all of the Korn fans out there and for all the kids who have parents that don't like them to listen to all the swearing.
5,5 kids from Bakersfield,"If you like the grinding and arguably ""rythmic"" detuned 7 string weapons,accompanied by some serious slap bass,scary but all too familiar lyrics (in this day & age) than this is for you! Considerably alot tighter & dynamic sounding than ""classic KORN?""Try out some of our local boys STAIND.Get your hands on the demo,and the new."
2,Korn as a whole,"Korn, hard hitting music with deeply emotional lyrics. even if you dont respect the band, you have to respect thier energy. ever since MTV got thier dirty hands on Korn, theyve been overplayed and have sold out. In the trend of Metallica's short haircuts, Korn has gone the mainstream route for money rather than integrity to the music they play. What expectations can you have for this album, already knowing that it will be bought because the media tells us to, korn is no longer the underground revoloution band, thier mainstream and losing thier edge. buy the album if you want to, but its a losing battle, and its not Korn's fault."
4,"Good, but not the best","I will admit this album is better than Follow the Leader.Basiclly the only good songs on the cd are Falling away from me and make me bad. Korn whispers too much and it makes them hard to hear. The cd was good but I think your money is better spent on Limp Bizkit , Blink 182 or Eminem."
4,This is a GOOD CD!,This CD is a good CD if you are a true KoRn fan from the begining in '94. Korn has not sold out. They may have attracted a little too much media with Follow The Leader but Issues is a quality album. Limp Bizkit has sold out.
4,"not their best, but still roolz","I got the wal-mart censored version of issues. I got it becuz my parents are sick of me buying uncensored versions like follow the leader and life is peachy. this is a good cd which is not as hard rock as the others, but creative. i highly reccomend the parental guidance versions if you have the opportunity and don't have parents like mine. they've made 4 cds and this is their 3rd best. self-titled is the best, then life is peachy, then issues. follow the leader is good, but probably the worst of the bunch.my fav. songs are "" Let's Get This Party Started,"" "" Trash,"" and "" Falling away From me."""
4,good but not the best,"this cd is alright but it isnt Korn's best. Their best CD is ""Life Is Peachy"" than second best cd is their self titled ""Korn"" than this. This is an alright cd but not the greastest from Korn. It's better than ""Follow The Leader"". Well if you liked Korn's previous albums I suggest you buy this one!"
2,This is horrible,"The worst korn cd i ever heard. 2 tracks on the whole thing i think i would listen to. i dont know what else to say. follow the leader had some awesome music, the music just is bad on this one as john davis wines about stuff. So if you want to hear that buy it now."
4,"MORE OF THE ""GOOD"" DOCTOR","This is the second of the 14 Fu Manchu books that Sax Rohmer gave us. Like the first, it is very episodic in nature, revealing its origin as a series of short magazine stories. A reading of the previous book WOULD be helpful for a full enjoyment of this volume, but is not absolutely necessary. Like the first book, this one is jam-packed with fast-moving action and bizarre adventure. It is surprisingly well written; sometimes even elegantly written. Just note the description of the seedy East End in Chapter 11 and you may want to upgrade your assessment of Rohmer as a wordsmith. Anyway, this particular installment of Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie's war against the evil genius Fu Manchu includes kidnappings, wire-jacket torture, poisonous cats, snake murders, albino peacocks, killer apes, quicksand, a haunted house, rat torture, mummy attacks and on and on. It's really remarkable how much stuff Rohmer packs into one short book. You won't be bored, that's for sure!"
5,Magical,"I probably listen to this album, or at least songs from it, every day. My favorite song of all time is now ""Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine"" which I have listened to hundreds of times since I first listened to the album in January 2012. It is now December 2012 and I can't remember the last day I went without listening to Brown Sugar or Voodoo. The music is just that good, and I haven't been this captivated by music since I first heard Motown. The album possesses a magical quality that merits hundreds if not thousands if not millions of re-listens."
5,Please listen,"This is a classic, the whole C.D. is great, u can let it play entirly and groove. I just love it."
3,Nice effort at real music.,"D'Angelo first record makes me hope that there will be more people that will play instruments again instead of standing behind some damn record player and scratching.That said, I find the songs are funky and soulful,except why be profane? was Marvin or Al Green profane? It's not necessary and juvenilizes the music."
3,D' Angelo.....Brown Sugar,"D'Angelo's Brown Sugar CD came out back in the late 90's and it was a hit then just as many of the songs now are still hits. I am not sure what happened to D'Angelo but he had a sultry voice that made the ladies scream. This is a good CD, nice vocals and beats. If you are considering purchasing Brown Sugar, I say it's a must purchase. Of course, YMMV.....NEOSOUL06."
4,good debut,"despite prince,marvin gaye,smokey robinson,stevie wonder&donny haithaway influence all over this disc d'angelo still has his own voice in there.he is a good writer and instrumentalist.vocals have moments as well.but i look foreward to vodoo.he will be around for a long time."
5,Brown Sugar to the Ears,"Having first heard of D'Angelo from his Voodoo album, I was not exactly a fan of his since the music was very advanced and raw sounding. Hoping that perhaps his previous effort was all that people say it is, I gave it a go.And was I in for a treat. From the opening track onward, this album is often considered one of the earliest Neo Soul albums, and yet it does not appear to be evolving; rather it is fully formed! Both D'Angelo (with Voodoo) and the other great of the genre Maxwell (with Embrya) have distinctive ideas of how this music should develope. Until a new sound is developed from these 'directions in music', we will just have to be happy with the work of these two stars and hope that the work put out by other artists will be as great as Brown Sugar.Favourite Tracks: Brown Sugar and Me And Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine. Highly recommended for R & B fans who have just been converted to the work of the Neo Soul Movement."
4,Brown Sugar by D'Angelo,"If it wasn't for me reading a VIBE magazine and noticing that this is one of the must-haves of my album collection, I wouldn't have this D'Angelo album.This album is explicit. The booklet features its lyrics. The songs on ""Brown Sugar"" are mellow, featuring Jazz elements and luring falsetto vocals at times. My initial experience with the album was impatient because I didn't like the first 5 tracks, but they grew on me. The worst track is ""[...], Damn, [...]."" Other than that, you get a groovier cover of Smokie Robinson's hit ""Cruisin'"" and a couple of optimistic tracks (""Alright"" & ""When We Get By""). ""Higher"" is elements of Gospel in it. All the other songs are lovely and decent. Another problem is that there's unnecessary repition towards the ending of selected songs, making this album longer than it had to be.I'd say the best track on this album is ""Smooth."" That VIBE suggestion to have this album did not go in vain."
4,outings,"My four month old son loves his new walker. I think my 21/2 year old loves even more. It's a great product the problem I have is it is time consuming to have to take it apart to take it to grandma, babysitters, ect. It don't fit in the trunk so I have to completly take it apart. Then put it back together everytime i take it with me. I just wish it could calapse or fold quick and easy. But I would still recomend it my son loves it."
1,BIG and BULKY!,"We have the baby girl version of this in pink and let me tell you, it is too big and heavy for a baby to walk around in. It has scuffed the bottom of our walls and it is just too big to store away when not in use. Our baby was in the 95th percentile for weight and height, but this walker still gave her much trouble in moving around in, I don't recommend this at all"
4,Great Jeep but not Great on Concrete,"My son LOVED this Jeep so much that we ended up buying a pink on when his sister came along a year later. The only problem I see with it is that it is hard for them to do on the concrete in our driveway. He had a much easier time inside on the carpet and hardwood. Also, the little dust stuff that is on concrete damaged the wheels quite a bit, but he literally scooted the wheels right off the Jeep. We bought it in pink for our little girl because his was worn out, we saved it to show him when he gets older."
3,Cute but not practical,"We are a Jeep driving family and my husband just had to have this walker for our daughter. Well, it is very cute but it also just got returned.The main problem is that is would not go together. The instructions were easy to follow but the pieces seems to be just a hair off. I tried to get it together and so did my husband and the slots just would not lin up.We did get it together enough for our daughter to give it a try. She played witht eh horn and the key for about two minutes and then looked at us like this is it.So the Jeep went back and we came home with a Mage Saucer...which she LOVES!"
3,It could be better,My son is 5 months old and got this for Christmas. He likes to turn the wheel and honk the horn but gets bored with it easily. The only toy on it is the steering wheel. Also if you have carpet like we do the walker does not move unless you push it. I wish we would have bought a stationary entertainer since it is basically the same thing as the Jeep on our carpet. Maybe it would be more fun if it had more toys on it. I gave this 3 stars because my son likes it and it is cute but I don't know if I would recommend this to any one.
1,Flimsy Wheels!,"We put our 4 1/2 month old son in this walker and within a week of minimal use, the wheels broke off! We have hard wood floors and tile so there is nothing to put a strain on the wheels, and our baby couldn't walk at all! Just gently pushing it along caused the front wheels to break off. Upon inspection, I found that they were attached to the walker with a flimsy, thin rod of plastic. This product is Cheap and not very entertaining, I would not recommend this to anyone, it was a waste of money."
1,Baby Walkers are not safe,"As a pediatrician, I feel that I must pass on that baby walkers are not safe to be using. Thousands of children each year are harmed by injuries with walkers. Children suffer many falls using the mobile walkers. Do not let your child use a walker. In addition, a walker actually inhibits your child's ability to walk--the walker prevents them using the muscles of the thighs and actually delays walking."
4,Great walker for my 10 month old!,"We purchased this walker when maya was just 7 months old and she liked it, but now she loves it! She is 10 months old and chases us in it into the kitchen and living room in it. It's helping her in her first stages of walking...and the cup holders make for great Cheerio bins while she's watching a Baby Einstein video with me...great walker - and cute noises."
2,Not entertaining enough!,"This walker is cute, but it just doesn't have enough entertainment value to amuse my son for any length of time. He easily tires of the three noises that it makes, and it doesn't roll around easily enough on my carpet. My mother purchased a Step and Play Piano that she keeps at her home for my son and he absolutely loves that. I think that I am going to retire the jeep walker and buy either the Step and Play or an ExerSaucer Ultra for my house. While these activity centers are a bit more expensive, I think that in the long run they will be better investments than Jeep Renegade walker."
5,Worth every penny,This bracelet is very beautiful and has a nice heavy feel to it. I bought this one for myself and would buy it as a gift also. Worth the money.
2,Pretty but low Quality,"I was happy when this blanket arrived at first glance. It looked very pretty, however the satin backing is incredibly cheap. I don't even think it should be called satin. It is extremely rigid and rough. Not soft for a baby."
2,Operator issue,"The operator being me. The fitting isn't tight, but it could be that I don't know how to tighten it properly."
4,Eclectically-good but weird compilation...,"Some good rare tracks on here (for me anyway), notably Come Undone (live) by Duran and the PSB remix of Blur's Girls&Boys. Oh and look out for an acoustic version of Tasmin Archer's UK #1 Sleeping Satellite... chillingly awesome"
5,NOTHING STATIONARY ABOUT THIS GEM,"One of Caravan's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
5,A Masterpiece!,"When this album was released in 1985 by Camel, it left me breathless. The album is truly a masterpiece. In this remastered edition we have a chance to loisten to the epic song ""Pressue Points"" in its full length (Previously released live on ""Pressure Points Live"" in 1985) and all its glory. As a taster for old Camel fans we also have a chance to listen to the previously unreleased song (Originally released in 1985 Pressure Points Concert film) ""In The Arms of the Waltzing Frauleins"". The rest of this concept album focuses on the political, emotional and loneliness themes. ""Stationary Traveller"", ""Vopos"", ""Long Goodbyes"" and ""West Berlin"" are other highlights. Andrew Latimer's playing and songwriting has never been this much emotional and effective. I believe this album is the best album I have heard during 80's and I really miss the live version of ""Stationary Traveller"" here. All in all I strongly suggest to any fan of Progressive rock to buy this CD."
4,GOOD MUSIC...GOOD CAMEL!!!,"HiI think this is the best album of Camel after Rajaz.A Pop-Rock album with variety of music and with genius of Andrew Latimer. good songs from susan hoover and many many more...!!!!SO if you don't listen that yet, Try it!!!!!"
5,Hooray For Santa Claus!,"You've got to be in a silly or giddy mood to truly appreciate this '60's classic. From suspense formulation to character development, SCCM tosses convention aside and disobeys all film making rules. In fact, it is so poorly done, it is downright enjoyable! Enjoy it with your friends for a good laugh. Be enchanted with lovely Pia Zadora's film debut (I think) as the cute little Martian girl. Be inspired as Carl Don's character, the 800+ year old Martian wiseman, proclaims, ""We Need A Santa Claus on Mars!"" Get downright geocentric as the Earth's Christmas Holiday spirit prevails over the Red Planet's system of overbearing logic and Grinch-esque gloom.Most importantly, jam to the film's wonderful jingle, ""Hooray For Santa Claus"", which I truly think is the best thing to come out of this movie. I believe this theme song is the most underrated Christmas carol of all time."
1,Horrible Quality DVD,"This version of the film is released by PASSPORT VIDEO which is bad news. Passport likes to put their logo in the corner of the screen and finds just about the worst quality they can possibly dig up. This DVD has jumps in the film and couldn't get too much more grainy looking.This is the second time I've been burned by Passport video. The first time being their DVD of Plan 9 From Outer Space which suffers the same fate. If I had noticed this one was released by Passport I wouldn't have bought it but I didn't even check. Shame on me and shame on Passport for releasing such garbage. Stay away from their releases at all costs.As for the film itself, see the review below."
5,Don't buy this on Amazon!,"You can get it for a dollar at Target. And, for only a dollar, it is the best value-to-price ratio ever. You and your friends will spend hours laughing at the silly quirks this movie is made up of. Voldar, Droppo, the whole gang are going to entertain your socks off."
3,Come on.....it ain't THAT bad!,"Maybe I'm nuts, (some would not argue, including my wife) but I like this movie. It's one of those flicks that looks like you could make it yourself. Santa, played by John Call, looks very convincing as a Santa, but that manical laugh,(you've got to hear it). Sounds like Santa's a little deranged. Pia Zadora is cute as a little martian. It's hard to believe grown adults would wear those goofy martian helmets(they had to starving). But this is a fun movie. That bouncy theme song; Voldar the nasty martian; and, if I'm not mistaken, Stobo the martian has a striking resemblence to Jamie Farr. The final credits say Al Nesor, but I believe that was an alias acting name for Mr. Farr back then. No wonder he changed his name for the movie. See this movie with your kids, it's harmless, there is no nudity; and the violence, what little there is, is hysterical! If you like movies like Robot Monster, Plan 9 from outer space, and EEGAH! like I do, then this movie is for you."
2,Initial charm runs out before the film does,"Despite, or because of, the cheapness of the production, ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" charms with its can-do pluckiness. And the fun and catchy opening theme song is a winner that really deserves more exposure. Those initial charms run thin too soon though, and along about the one hour mark (though your mileage may vary) those charm points have expired and the movie ultimately fails to offer any renewal of those charms for too long a time before coming to an end.Love the song, though."
2,She's in the attic!,"This movie's almost unwatchable without Joel and the 'Bots! The music, one song!, is insipid! How many Christmas songs mention Santa? Seriously! Martians beaten by toys! Nuff said! Santa as a Deus Ex Machina! Watch it without the MST3K crew, but really Irish up the eggnog first!"
1,High-Quality Video of a Truly Horrible Movie,"Since the early 1990s, this infamous holiday turkey has been a public-domain favorite. If you want a decent copy of ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" (1964), track down the videocassette from Embassy/Nelson - owners of the original negative. Regardless of print quality, this low-budget schlockfest deserves recognition as one of the all-time worst movies. Unlike the ouvre of Ed Wood, ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is painfully bad. Composer Milton DeLugg's cringe-worthy ""Hooray for Santy Claus"" remains among the film's many horrors."
3,Hang up that mistletoe,"Soon you'll hear Ho! Ho! Ho!It is the Christmas season on earth. The Martian children are in a funk and will not eat their chocolate cake pills. Kimar (Leonard Hicks) a concerned father and a leader of the council calls up on the old man of the cave. His diagnosis is that Mars Needs a Santa; so in the interest of the children of Mars Kimar sets out to pilfer Santa (John Call.) Opposed to this attempted attitude change on a planetary scale is the curmudgeon Voldar (Vincent Beck). You cannot miss Voldar because he looks like a green Groucho Marks. To add to the pathos a couple of pint size hostages are also taken, Billy (Victor Stiles) and Betty (Donna Conforti).Is this the end of Christmas, as we know it?What is Voldar's evil plan?Are Billy & Betty doomed to drift around in space, or be captives of Mars forever?On the other hand, is it just possible that Santa Claus Conquers the Martians?"
3,I've seen worse,"Ah-hah-hah-hah! Ah-hahh! Eee! Ah-hahh! Eee-hoo-hee-hah! And you think this movie is bad? How can a movie with a villain that looks like Frank Zappa be that bad? ESS-AY-EN-TEE-AY! SEE-EL-AY-YOU-ESS! Okay I'll stop now! Can anyone tell me if the MST-3K version of this is available? Just a few movies that are worse than SCCTM: The Crying Game, Thelma & Louise, The Black Swan, Amityville Horror, I could go on forever. Hell, I'd rather sit through Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park than that stupid ""Crying Game"" UGH!"
4,Kristmas Kitsch,"As a kid this was probably my favorite x-mas movie because it was the only time I ever saw a kid that looked like me. I'm talking about the martian children. Also because it was just silly but then what isn't when it's associated to Santa Claus. Seriously, mix up a batch of martini's, stoke the fire and enjoy watching Pia Zadora's debut in tinsel town. If anything at least least dance to the groovy title music."
1,"Oh, Prunella....","This Epic Should Be Shown At Thanksgiving Because It's A Bigger Turkey Than Anything You'll Put On Your Table!....And A Score By Milton DeLugg.....It's Demonic, Brother......I Bought This In A 3 For A Buck Bin & I Want A Refund!..........33 cents Ain't What It Used To Be!........But It Makes A Great Coaster For My Beer!.......Have A Merry Kiddies!"
2,And the Best of the Worst of the Worst is:,"This movie ranks at the top of my Golden Turkey list, right along with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". It is so-o-o bad it is actually good.Like many other bad movies, it was mocked and scorned by the guys on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and is still being watched and traded by the diehard fans.If you were to (purposely) get one bad movie this year, make it Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. It's a laugh a minute."
1,Wow! It Actually Did its Job!,"If you want a nice family movie to put on for your kids so they will leave you alone, put this on. You will not hear a peep out of them while its on, ok maybe some snoring. I received this movie as a child like 12-15 years ago and it worked for me too. I seriously don't even remember what happens at the end of the movie because I don't think I have ever gotten past the first half hour. This film will definitely do its job of putting your kids to sleep, hey it is almost guaranteed to work for you too. This movie will definitely put sleeping pills off the market, it works like a charm."
2,not remastered,i enjoyed the movie as i have not seen it on tv since the seventies but it is not remastered as the advertising says in fact the quality is awful.
2,Good For A Laugh,"I loved and seen this movie many times as a kid. I have owned this on VHS for years and have not been able get myself to watch it. In fact it is still in the shrink wrap. LOL I think it's because my brother makes fun of me. (We are both in our 40's)I just wanted to point out that if I remember correctly, Jamie Farr is also in it....I didn't see any reviews mentioning him.I think I will sit down with a few drinks and watch it. I need a good laugh."
3,"One of the best of the ""BAD MOVIES""","This one is an absolute ""HOOT"".If you enjoyed PLAN 9 from OUTER SPACE,you'll love it.The theme song itself is worth watching the video for .It is without a doubt one of the best of the ""BAD MOVIES""An absolute must for the collector of pure SCI-FI silliness."
5,Possibly the worst movie ever made!,Which is why it gets five stars. This all-time king of box office bombs entertains by awfulness. Must be seen to be believed. Buy two because you'll wear one out very quickly.
4,"Martians Kidnap Santa, But All Turns Out OK In The End!","This has been one of my favorite holiday films since I first saw it back in the 1960's. It's an extremely cheesy, super low budget film, but that just adds to the charm. The Martians wear tons of green make-up and are dressed in green tights, with hilarious headgear which looks as if the costume designer had lots of pipe left over from a plumbing job and didn't want to waste it. Mars children are depressed because they don't know how to play and have fun, so the leader of the Martians goes to Earth to kidnap Santa. Don't worry, there is a happy ending. Lots of fun and many laughs (not intentional!)"
4,Corny but a classic,"If you want to see a Christmas movie with a production budget somewhere around $5, you can't do better than this classic. The sets, acting, costumes and make up are so bad that they wouldn't be accpted by a kindegarden class. But yet, you can't help but to laugh at this movie. It is more campier than then the Batman TV show. I could spend hours writing about how bad the actors (a cast of complete unknowns) are, but I'll let you judge for youself."
4,A Crazy Christmas Film!!!,"This was like a Christmas movie on drugs! There are aliens, robots, cheesy special effects, and Santa Claus. There are quite a few laughs at the silly dialogue and fake battle sequences. In the end, this is a pretty good movie. When all the children of Mars become sad that they don't have anyone to spread holiday cheer, Kimar and his group travel to Earth to kidnap Santa. Along the way, they also kidnap two children named Betty & Bill. When they get to Mars, everybody loves that Santa is there, except Voldar who tries to get rid of him before Christmas, because he thinks Santa is corrupting the minds of the children of Mars. Will Santa, Betty, Bill, Kimar, and the children of Mars be able to stop Voldar? I'd definitely recommend SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS!!!"
2,If only they let Santa use a machine gun.....,"Martians travel to Earth to find the man called Santa Claus played by John Call (The Anderson Tapes, Cinderella) because their Martian children are watching the Earth TV programs. While landing in a city 2 Earth children are found and they eventually hide on the ship. They are found and the children lead the Martian's to the North Pole as they Martians find Santa Claus and take him and the kids away. Vincent Beck (Vigilante, The Bamboo Saucer) plays Voldar, a rouge Martian who doesnt like Santa Claus and wants to get rid of him and the children for good. Soon the awesome powers of Santa fight back at the Martians and save Christmas. Harmless cheesy Christmas movie is really bad but I didnt mind it at all. The music was groovy. Wasnt the greatest thing ever. Also starring Pia Zadora (Hairspray, Pajama Tops) and Leonard Hicks (Guns of the Trees)"
3,Kids Love It!...,"Yes, SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS is completely idiotic from an adult point of view. However, kids (toddlers) love it and that's who it was really made for in the first place. Santa is kidnapped by martians in order to bring Christmas to Mars. Once there, he ""conquers"" his green-tinted captors with his rather bizarre charm and silly wit. Lots of flashing lights, a spaceship that looks like a flying bundle of toilet paper rolls, Torg the robot, and ""freeze-ray"" guns are just some of the highlights! This is totally harmless holiday fluff. Of course, you parents may want to duck out while the kids enjoy it, as watching it may induce a state not unlike suffering a stroke while sleeping with your head in a vice! Merry X-Mas..."
1,(really NO STARS) Voted All time worst Movie by cineclub,"A group of us voted this the all-time worst movie (yes, even worse than plan-9). I first saw this movie xmas eve in the mid 80's, when I was stuck in a relatives basement, freezing, cuz all the warm rooms were taken. It was adequate eye-candy to keep me conscious, moving and alive. But I couldn't imagine watching it again, even if my life depended on it. (Although I did watch it again for the cineclub vote) It may be considered fun by some to watch bad movies (they obviously LOVE this one), but I think I'd rather read and use a Time-Life Self-Root Canal video."
4,Camp!,"I won't expound on the story since everyone else already has. It is pure CAMP! Don't expect more. (I bet you didn't know that Martians read and write in English too. They even label some equipment in their ship as ""radar box""!) Either you liked it as a child or not. Keep in mind it was made back in 1964. (I bet most of the reviewers on this page weren't alive then.)I will just talk about the quality of the DVD. It is not great...just okay. It has all of the blemishes that you see on the film when broadcast on t.v.. Even the beginning song is missing a few frames at the start.Don't get me wrong. It's not as bad as ""The Red Balloon"" DVD (nothing is! not even ""Meet The Feebles""). Just don't pay top dollar for it. Look for a bargin."
1,"One star, but a must-see","I wish this movie got as much Christmastime TV exposure as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" -- its awfulness deserves to be savored by fans of bad movies everywhere. I don't know where to begin. I'll begin and end at the beginning -- is there a worse movie theme song in the history of sound?And it's not only that the theme song is so bad -- I mean, yeah, it's REALLY bad -- but what kills me is that at the end of the movie, the reprise is accompanied by the lyrics on the screen along with a bouncing ball -- as if someone would actually want to sing it!No wonder Pia Zadora went on to make ""The Lonely Lady"" -- she knew she'd already scraped bottom years before."
2,Classic stinker!,"On the planet Mars, it seems the children have no joy or laughter in their hearts as Martian leader Kimar (Leonard Hicks) brings his team to Earth to find Santa Claus (John Call) to fix the problem. While they do the job they also kidnap two children Bill (Victor Stills) and Betty (Donna Confroti) to take them to Mars however a dastardly Martian plans on killing Santa and bringing no joy to the planet but can our jolly elf save the day?An unbelievable mess! It's a trainwreck of a film that has to be watched to see why Mystery Science Theater 3000 picked this trash and has been called one of the worst films of all time. The plot is beyond idiotic as is the acting and writing, the costumes especially that dumb looking robot with polar bear are just laughable as hell and there's sense of fun to be found anywhere.Please watch it in the MST3K version instead."
1,Give me a break!,"Other then some cute characters, don't watch this one. The soundtrack is pathetic, the writing and plot throughly unbeleivable, and the cost of the film is worth more then the performances."
4,Brilliantly Dumb Christmas Movie,"Yes Virginia there is such thing as brilliantly dumb. This movie has all the marks of B Movie. Awful acting, flimsy plot, stupid dialogue, crappy effects and cardboard costumes. Heh Heh just the way I like it. Look this movie isn't some cruddy senitmental box office busting Christmas movie it turns the formulaic Christmas movie story on its head. Instead Martians with green face paint and fake metal helmets kidnap two earth kids and Santa Clause and take them to Mars so that they can make space toys for Martian kids. That alone should make you buy the thing. Junk yes, Art yes!"
4,Martian dudes are super rad!!,"Santa Claus should have gotten into fights with the Martians, especially the dude who tried to kill the little kids. If Santa Claus had done that, then the movie would have been 5 stars. All around, the movie is pretty suave."
2,Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,This is famously one of the worst movies ever made and it lived up to its reputation. I bought it for a joke.
4,"Very Good, But not enough on the plague itself","Bell's book gives a comprehensive look at the London plague outbreak of 1665, which claimed 100,000 lives. Beginning at the start of the year, the book covers the evolution of the outbreak through to December. I found that I enjoyed the second half of the work much more than the first, which is little more than a detailed description of 17th century London. Only in the book's second half does the author talk about the plague and its effects, and even here he goes into little detail. We hear little about the science of the disease or of its impact on the human body, and nothing about earlier epidemics. This may be due to a shortage of sources available to the author, but it keeps his book from being as comprehensive as it might have been. Nevertheless, Bell has written a great book on an often forgotten catastrophe."
5,good stuff,"This is just great music. Besides, I alway like to see guys from my home town doing well. I just have to correct the guy who said Chuck Pitre is the late Audie's brother. Well man, your wrong, there is no relation."
3,Sadly lacking,The first half of the recording is fine of the loon's in the background but there is a distracting noise of water in the foreground that does not sound quite natural. It sounds like someone dabbling in bath water in their tub. It probably isn't but it detracts from the peaceful sounds of the birds. My mind was constantly trying to figure out what exactly was making the sound of the water.
5,Wonderful and Natural,"I love this CD. I've had it for several years and I use it mainly to help me sleep, especially when away from home. There is no music, and I've never heard anything on it that isn't of nature (such as a honking horn, or cars, which I've actually heard on other nature recordings. It's also not a 'short track' recorded over and over. I LOVE IT."
5,Can't beat it for the price,"I bought this printer on the recommendation of other reviewers here, and I have to say I'm very, very pleased. If I had known earlier that a laser printer of this quality could be had for such a low price, I would have never wasted my money on stupid, chintzy, slow inkjet printers that always seem to break down after a year. I never used the colors anyway.As for the Samsung, it's fantastic. It is fast, has high-quality print, and has a very small footprint. I've had this one for a couple of months now and have had no problems whatsoever. Just listening to this baby warm up gets me excited for some reason. Maybe because it reminds me that I'm getting great printing for a great price."
4,"Great price, easy to use, good print qualtiy, fast printouts","I just set up my printer and have only printed about 20 pages or so, but I love it so far. The setup was so easy I almost thought I must have forgotten something. It's fairly quite, it prints great, and the toner/drum cartridge will last for thousands of pages...all for under 200 bucks! How can you go wrong? If you don't like it simply return it, but if you do love it you've saved about 200 bucks between this and its HP equal."
4,Problem with paper feed,Have had the printer for about 2-3 years now.Has worked well - being used regularly for home use.Have had a problem recently with paper not feeding .. so have looked on this site and others for help.The problem was with the band. A suggestion I found on another site was to remove the band on the cam and turn it inside out.This worked well - so I hope it may help others with a similar problem?(You need to remove about a dozen screws to get to the cam - ( start by removing the toner then the back section - you can then take the top off and unscrew a couple of parts to get to the cam.)
5,Great home printer,"We have had this printer for 2 years and it works great. Toner goes forever--changed it one time so far. Never jammed, never a problem. It's fast too."
3,Headaches,"1. When it enters ""sleep mode"" it never wakes up and requires a re-boot.2. The paper feed is very finicky. If the weather is humid many sheets stick together and jam the printer.3. It often takes great strength and effort to pull out a paper jam."
5,Best Bang for the Buck,"I bought an HP 920C and while putting in the cartridge the caddy broke. So I returned it and was shopping for a different printer. Then reading my PC World magazine I saw that they gave great raves for this particular printer.So I went on the net and did more research on Cnet and indeed this printer was highly rated by the Cnet reviewer (Editor's Choice) and by other users. I found that CompUSA was the only retailer with this in stock so I rushed out and bought one the same day.And I don't regret it at all. This printer performs like a [price] Laserjet and costs only [price]. It's fast and has great quality. And it's compatible with Mac, Windows 9x/2000 and even Linux. I'd recommend this to everybody!"
3,Not as easy to use as it should be.,"1. It won't work with DOS, so beware of the type of software you'll be using it on. Our payroll company didn't tell us that they were using DOS in their software.2. I could never get it to print to LPT1 with just a parallel cable even after disabling my USB hookups under the setup and in the control panel.3. If an Excel spreadsheet is too complicated (even without color), it will freeze up.After finding these things out, I wound up paying [$$'s] to return the printer. That's the price of the toner, including tax."
2,"Eats Toner, Breaks after a few thousand pages","Buyer alert: this printer eats toner like there is no tomorrow, 2500 pages is not much from a laser cartridge, but in real life it never even comes close to this (officially rated) output. If you print half of the official rating before having to plunk down another $70 for a new cartridge, count yourself lucky.To add insult to injury, the feed roller is made of low grade rubber which deteriorates to such a degree after 3-4000 pages that it will jam the paper every single time, thus making the printer completely useless. For most users this occurs after the warranty is up, so you get to choose between a service call costing about the same amount as the printer's new price, or just buying another printer. I know the next one will not be a Samsung..."
1,Doesn't work on my imac,"I am sure this is a good printer - but not for an imac. i purchased this printer and have spent 2 days on the phone with Samsung technical support - they have sent us 3 different drivers for macs, none of which worked. in fact, the first driver corrupted my OS system and i had to do a clean install to repair the damage!"
3,need feedback here,the test page printed in compusa looked to me horrible. Same in other stores. Apple 300 dpi lasers 10 years ago looked far better than this. Now everybody here seem to be happy with it - quality wise. What am I missing ?? Would you print your resume on it ? How about black text on this vs modern ink-jets (say Canon S300). thanks.
1,Horrid colored text printing,"I bought this printer based on all the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I must send it back as I print many documents which have text that is near black but not exact black. To the human eye and on screen, the text appears black. But, in realtiy, the text isn't pure black. When I print this on the ML1210, the letters and graphics appear very dithered, worse than a dot matrix printer. At 300 dpi it's not even readble. Compare this with HP and Panasonic lasers in which the documents print just fine. They also print fine on my HP deskjet printer.If you are going to only be printing pure black (RGB 0 0 0) text or graphics then this printer will do you well, otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,Not grabing paper,I had the same problem as many others in that I couldn't get the printer to grab paper after some time. I took the printer apart which was only afew screws and not difficult at all and removed the 'rubber band' on the paper graber spindal. I turned the 'rubber band' inside out and put it back on. NO reason to order a new one since the inside was protected and not dried out.
5,best printer ever!!,I have had my Samsung ML 1210 printer for over 10 years!! You gotta be kidding right?? NOPEIt has been amazing and its the best and most used printer I have ever ownedI have been through some other printers ..Brothers etc and will only ever buy a Samsung from now onBy far the best investment I have ever made!Lately it has been having trouble with feeding the paper and will sometimes feed 3 or 4 sheets at a timeI am hoping that the person on here that posted the q tip trick to clean the cam and rubber band feeder will repost just how to do that because this machine has been a workhorse for me and I want to be using it for the next 10 years!! LOL
5,Personal Laser Out Performs Office Laser,"I would expect the quality, speed, and features to cost 2- 3 times as much as this printer did. I set it up, printed the demo page, installed the software and printed my first page in about 10 minutes. I have Windows XP and USB ports and this printer is a dream addition to my home hardware. Thank you Samsung for providing a printer that does everything you advertise it to do. And thank you Amazon for selling it."
5,Excellent Printer for the Money!!,I was trying to decide between a new color printer and a laser printer. I realized that I really don't need to print in color an most of my work would be just word processing. So I decided to take a look at the Samsung printer after a recommendation from a friend.I've had the printer for 2 months now with zero problems or complaints. The quality and speed of this printer is exceptional. Setup was very easy and the options are everything I need.The great thing about buying the printer now is a free toner/ink cartridge. Don't waste your time with overpriced HP laser printers. This one works allot better than the HPs I have at work for half the price.
5,Inexpensive Printer that really delivers,"In short, this printer is everything that you could want in a SOHO environment. It is extremely quiet, attractive, has very good printout, and saves you money. Bottom Line. Installation is extremely easy. Just pull the tape off the sides, insert toner, plug it in and go.The only negative reviews this printer gets is when printing graphics and colored web text. If you are going to print a lot of detailed graphics, I would not recommend this printer (not that the output is that bad).However, to print out crisp web-text, just:1) Copy and paste all the text from the pages into Word (or your favorite text editor)2) Get it arranged like you want it3) Push Ctrl+A (to select all of the text)4) Goto Format, Font and set the Font Color option to black.This will make all of the web-text come out crisp and clear (even on toner-save mode).I highly recommend this printer."
5,Incredible value - I love it,"Just for grins, I decided to try the economy mode, printing 16 pages on a single sheet of paper. I can read it perfectly with a magnifying glass. The quality of the output is as good, if not better, than the industrial strength HP megaprinter I use at work, and it cost about 1/10 as much. The USB option works fine, but you'll have to purchase your own USB/A - USB/B cable."
5,FANTASTIC Printer at a FANTASTIC PRICE!,"This printer is PERFECT for home use! Believe it or not, IT WAS PLUG AND PLAY WITH WINDOWS XP! The easiest printer installation I have ever experienced! I just plugged it in, rebooted, and BAM, Windows XP installed it! No Driver Disk needed! On top of that, the quality of the print-outs could not be better! CRYSTAL CLEAR! If you had any doubts about a home laser printer, erase them! This printer is PERFECT! 5 STARS! I just love it when things work the way they are supposed to! :)"
5,"fast, very low price, great quality !!!","this printer is wonderful, blows away any inkjet printer, quality is excellant, dont ever have to worry bout smearing or for the paper to ""dry"", the only thing that i have a hard time getting used to is the 20-25 second warm up time, but from what i hear that's normal for laser printers...once it gets cranking though it's awesome...oh yea the two toner cart's help it alot, and the fact that the design uses a toner/drum in one, you dont have to worry about buying a new drum (that will cost you as much as the printer itself) after going through 5 toner carts...and the toner/drum design in one is cheaper then most toner cart's alone (you can find a toner cart online..., they print up to 2500 pages in normal mode and 3000-3500 pages in toner save, how can any printer compare) ...way better then the hp at work, and faster too...A+++++++++++++++++"
3,Not the best,I really love the way this lotion smells and that it isnt greasy and soaks in fast. But for me after it soaks in my hands are back to feeling dry. Ill use the rest of the bottle anyways but this is a bummer for me :/
3,Upgrading made easy,"I find that upgrading is made much easier now that I can simply eat my old hardware when it's time to upgrade.However, I'm not fond of the promiscuous mode aftertaste that Orinco cards have. Perhaps if you can train yours to stop sniffing other computers, then you might be able solve this.-- James"
3,Good Summary Book,"This is an excellent book for quick reference of your trip. I use it alot in the cockpit, but find more detail would be better. The layout is good for going north to south, but I find the backwards reading (South to North) a little difficult to follow. I recommend this as a companion book along with others, but not as a stand alone book unless you are the casual boater (weekender)"
2,"ICW - Just The Facts, Ma'am","Brief factual info is here, but presented in a dry, impersonal manner with no interesting first-person commentary or helpful sidebars. Marinas are not described well, or rated, with any commentary on shore-side attractions. A disappointing product from a husband-wife team; we were hoping for a bit of entertainment as well as education."
2,Poorly organized,"I was looking forward to listening to this on a long trip. The reader is fairly clear but attempts to give different accents to characters and does not always carry it off. but mostly I was annoyed to find no listing for where each story started. I had to search track by track for where the story I was interested in started. For instance, the Ring of Thoth starts on disc 7 track 6 - but I had to find that for myself.How hard could it have been to create a track listing?I found the Scottish accent affected by the reader to be inconsistent and somewhat annoying. But I do give credit for the reading being clear and reasonably paced.I would be hesitant to buy another audio CD from this group."
5,Great works perfectly in college environment,"It works perfectly. It holds all my shower things conveniently. Cheap price, great value, and got here pretty fast. I would recommend this to any college student living in dorms."
4,Large and inaccessible,"This item is most likely great if you're bringing a lot of large bottles into a shower with you, but if it's just 1 bottle, a razor, and a few other small items, it's not so good.It's wide and deep with no pockets. I'm giving it 4 stars regardless because if this is what you need it seems like a great product."
3,color pictured is not what you get,"Just a warning for people who are concerned about appearance - or, as in my case, are hoping to use this as something other than a shower caddy: Although the item in the picture is white, what I actually received was electric purple."
3,BRIGHT PINK AND GREEN,"I ordered the shower totes for my son and my nephew who are going to college and thought the color is either grey or cement color. To my surprise, they came in hot pink and bright green. Must Return!"
3,Too tall & needs a hook to hang it from,"It is much taller than I expected. It works fine, but I wish it was shorter and had some sort of hook so you could hang it over the shower curtain rod - it gets wet when I hang it over the shower head or faucet."
1,Picture showed WHITE - Product arrived LAVENDER - ordered for a male. :(,"I ordered this as a gift, needed TOMORROW - the photo showed a WHITE caddy and there was no other description on the site about color... the caddy that arrived is LAVENDER and the gift is for a MALE!! Super lame... and then obviously, I don't want to order a replacement because there is no way to know what color is going to arrive. Not even worth going through the hassle of the return process. Just consider this one a loss."
3,too big!,"This is a sturdy and well-made product, but somehow I did not realize how large it was. I needed it for taking my shampoo and other stuff back and forth to the pool and for that it is not a good fit. With this inside, even though it is slightly collapsible, my backpack extends so far out from my back it is hard to negotiate the bus at rush hour! Why so big???"
3,Not as pictured!,"I ordered this shower caddy for my son who is going off to college. Unfortunately, the product I received was not as pictured. Instead of being white or gray as pictured, the one we got is BRIGHT green. While it's functionality and design seems much better and less cumbersome than some of the hard plastic types, I am really contemplating how this fits in with the navy blue, black and gray ""man"" thing we had going! We might have to re-think this one..."
1,Shower Caddy....,Received item quickly but was VERY DISAPPOINTED with the colors. I was not given the option to choose a color...was purchasing for my son in the military...was sent bright pink and electric blue. ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? NOT happy at all!!!!
2,Sent the wrong color...pic shows grey and white I got Lavender,"Be advised that you may not receive the item as it is shown in the picture. I just received mine in the mail and it is Lavender in color. Not just accents either, the mesh and everything. Solid Lavender"
2,Much too big!,I read the reviews about how it was big but thought it looked good so I bought it. Well it is Really big! Not sure what I will use it for but my son is not taking it to college. Maybe if you wanted something that would fit a hair bolower and curling iron it would be good. I does seem well constructed.
2,PINK,"Ok, to be fair I haven't used the product. That's because they sent my a pink one! I am a guy going into my freshmen year of college, there is no way I'd use a pink one of these in the dorms...."
4,Performed as described,"The only issue I had with it was that I wasn't prepared for how much water it held and how big it was. If you don't have a place to hang it in the shower you're going to use, I wouldn't buy it. Otherwise, it was great. It held all my super-sized items comfortably."
4,Meh.,"It serves its purpose wonderfully. I am in no way unsatisfied. At first I thought it was too tall ... there is a good 3-4 inches from the tallest bottle in there. But then I see my college roommate always having her little tote (like half the height but twice as wide (long) ... so it's about 8 or so inches long ... 2 or 3 inches wide ... and about 4-5 inches tall (this is my roommate's tote)) tip over and spill all the stuff in it. I feel that this tote having a circle as a base makes it more stable than my roommate's tote's base being an oval.So, it does everything great, but there's nothing fantastic about it. I'm not in love with it; I'm just satisfied. That's why it gets four stars."
1,random color send,"I have the same experience as a previous reviewer. I purchased this item for my son as he heads off to college and received a pink one. That isn't going to work. The odd part is that I was given a choice when I placed my order and I chose black, but was still sent a pink one. As usual Amazon was wonderful and gave me a credit for this item, so I am now shopping on Amazon for another style shower caddy. Do not recommend this one unless you are color blind."
3,Disappointed,"It dries very quickly. When I take in my gym bag, my toiletries fall out. It's great in the shower. You can see your items. Wish it had a hook."
2,Just too large!,I took this to the races with me... it was just larger than I had ever imagined. I wish I could find one smaller.
4,Lots to Tote About,"The tote is very decently sized! I had a much smaller one that perfectly fit all of the items I needed to tote. Not paying too much attention to the dimensions of this one, once I received it I realized the size of the tote! If you have a lot of items and/or you have full sized items (I put a Costco sized shampoo in mine and it still doesn't portrude from the top), this is definitely for you.While the tote does have a drainage hole in the bottom, plan on this thing dripping for a while if you take it into the shower with you. Usually, I drain the tote when I finish and hang it up for about a minute before draining it again. Even then it will still drip a decent amount, which is the reason why I only gave it 4-stars."
4,Decent,"I purchased this product because I am leaving for college and I needed something to hold all of my shower supplies in. The tote holds a fair amount of items, but I wasn't ecstatic about the quality. I swear I've seen things like this in the dollar store....However, despite this, it's still a good buy and very easy to store."
3,"nice product, disappointed by lack of color choices","This is a perfectly nice shower caddy, and for the price it's fairly large and seems like it will hold up fairly well. My only gripe is that it is only mentioned once, in small print at the very end of the product description that it is available in a variety of colors, and not mentioned anywhere else that you don't get to CHOOSE the color.This kind of thing is normally a non-issue, especially when the colors are all fairly unisex. Personally, I was expecting to receive a gray one as in the photo, yet I am sitting here (a 20-year old male) staring down a lavender shower tote that I'm not sure I'll ever have the heart to use."
