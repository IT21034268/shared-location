5,Wonderful!,"Thank you, Harshav and Harshav, for your work! This is a wonderful collection, well-translated and with excellent introductions and biographies of the poets. I am a graduate student studying Yiddish literature, and often recommend this book to friends. Hopefully a paperback edition will someday be published..."
4,Good Stuff,"Good CD. Upbeat, kinda rockin'. Better than her later stuff which gets a little poppy. I find myself listneing to the whole CD which is rare given the way we listen to music now."
5,Great food reserve or in pinch meal!,"We buy Mountain House to have on hand for emergencies and have found them to be the best tasting, freeze dried meals around.I admit I wish the prices were a bit lower but for quality, taste and shelf life, you honestly cannot beat Mountain House products. I will admit they can be high in sodium but in a pinch or emergency, having quality food with a long shelf life is what is most important.We had a neighbor over because she was leary of buying these products and we wanted to prove to her just how good they were. She was very surprised by the quality, texture and taste as well as the ease of preparing the food. She said she will be looking to purchase Mountain house from now on!Mountain House, you rock!"
5,"Great Stuff, Great Service!","I ordered a few Mountain House cans to serve as a staple in my kitchen because I wanted to have tasty food easily available on those days that I work. After all, we all have those days when we *really* don't want to cook, and the pizza expenses were getting ridiculous. Mountain House has never let me down in the flavor department and is easy as heck. And to top it all off, though I ordered my cans yesterday with 2 day shipping, they're here already. Excellent service, Amazon."
5,Mountain House foods,Tried this several times in pouch form as a way of testing. Really like it and would eat this as a meal at any time. Bought for emergency backup because of shelf life. Great product.
5,great price for a quality product,I'm always on the lookout for Mt. House bargains--they are hard to find. The best prices are on Amazon but you have to be patient.
4,Tastes pretty good,"Was looking for something to put at the camp for a quick meal in a pinch. Decided I better try it before subjecting others to it. Followed the directions on the package and it turned out pretty good. I was a little bland, but salt and pepper fixed that up. One serving as measured would not be enough to fill up a normal american male, but two servings hit the spot and would surely get me by. I do worry that it recommends that it be consumed entirely within a week of opening. It's good enough that I would keep it at work and eat it for lunch (not saying a lot as I will also eat Ramen Noodles for lunch occasionally). Not bad at all for something that I could bury in the yard and dig it up 15 years later and eat. I am only giving it 5 stars because the price is a little high."
2,Very Expensive Food....,"At this price, a person pays nearly $15 dollars per ONE POUND of food. I have found this product cheaper. The food is good, taste well enough but the price is just too much for such a small portion."
3,You will never have a review from me.,"I'm not going to open this until TEOTWAWKI. So either an EMP has taken out the entire electrical grid forever or the government has taken over production of food and is confiscating all of our food to feed the congress. So in the case the first scenario, there will be no internet and no Amazon and therefore no review for you. In the second scenario, I won't want DHS tracking me down and taking my macaroni and cheese.I guess there could also be zombies and they don't eat macaroni and cheese, so in that case, I'll leave a review once I open the can."
5,MOUNTAIN HOUSE SWEET&SOUR PORK W/RICE,A GOOD HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT. WE USE IT AS PART OF OUR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS KIT.AS USUAL THERE WILL BE SOME DETRACTORS OUT THERE THAT WILL COMPARE IT TO SOME GOURMET STANDARD & BAD MOUTH IT. BUT IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST OVERALL.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT TO BE INCLUDED IN YOUR PREPAREDNESS OR CAMPING KIT.
3,its good but not great,"It's ok, the nutrition is pretty bad and it doesn't taste that great but its still a cool novelty a little too expensive"
3,crackers,they were sweet tasting and very good but not like the pilot biscuits we buy in Alaska they went to Montana on a trip with mu husband and he enjoyed them
4,rocket pop,"These were actually fun! For the price they delivered! My girls (4 and 6) loved them. They shot really far. They are a ""cheap"" made product, but my kids don't care about that they are more into quantity then quality. If we did a party would buy more for everyone to shoot them."
4,Fun!,"This toy is simple yet lots of fun for kids and adults alike. I bought these for my son's birthday party and they were a hit. Each package comes with two ""launchers"" and multiple darts. Makes a great indoor or outdoor activity. Even our cat loves them!"
4,Fun and Silly,"I bought 3 of these, one for my 4 yr old, one for my 8 yr old and another for my friend's 3 yr old. Every single kid loves it.My two spend hours 'fighting', shooting foam rockets at each other from room to room. They are pretty good at cleaning them all up, even though we have found a few under furniture.I wouldn't call it durable, because foam and light plastic can and will break pretty easily. But thus far, we are doing ok.These are great for birthday party gifts for those that don't want to spend much money."
5,Fantastic toy that's great fun,"For the price, I don't think you can have more fun. We have had hours of enjoyment, adults and kids alike having rocket wars!"
5,The first COMPLETE soundtrack of Godspell,"Great soundtrack to Godspell. This album was overseen by Steven Schartz himself and contains the opening number of the show The ""Tower of Babble"" that is on not on ANY other version of the soundtrack. Also has "" Beauiifull City""(from the film). It is an English cast, and does not sound AS dated as other versions of the show. Recomended!!"
2,Think twice before buying this one,"I just recieved my copy of the '93 cast recording and was very dissapointed. There does not seem to be the passion on this one as there is on the Motion Picture soundtrack. The vocals are not as good and the harmonies are so off. If you like Godspell and are considering this version,think twice. I got it because of the glowing reviews and will think long and hard before I do that again. Stick with the movie soundtrack,it's the definetive recording."
4,Must-have for theatrical production reviewers!,"This recording uses the same band constituents as recommended for production of Godspell, and has all of the songs from the score, plus a delightfully different solo version of Beautiful City. The vocals are true to the score, and as such, this album is great addition to any collection, as well as a fantastic tool for anyone thinking about producing Godspell."
4,"Dull recording, but great music nonetheless.","Godspell is a very difficult show to categorize; not quite rock, not quite show tunes, not quite anything. Although the various other recordings are very good, i have to admit that I like this one the best simply becasue of the presence of the Prologue, a terrific (although complicated, and some say unneccesary) little piece at the beginning. On this recording, that as well as several other songs are well done - God Save the People, All For the Best, Beautiful City, and On the Willows are very well represented. However, many other tracks are just dull; there is no feeling at all in Bless the Lord My Soul, Alas For You, or We Beseech Thee; they are totally flat. The singing is top notch, as is the small orchestra, and the cd is quite worth it; just dont expect any sort of real performances."
5,Top notch Trek Soundtrack,"This is the greatest Trek series. All the songs were great except the ""single version"" of the main title, which was awkward. Overall I recommend this cd."
5,A Place on the Water,"A Place on the Water: An Angler's Reflections on HomeMy first review and this book deserves it. ""A Place on the Water"" belongs on the shelf of every outdoorsman, especially if you have fished the Midwest. Fully captures the joys of youth, family, friends, and the outdoors. The best of short story, outdoor writing."
3,Interesting,"this movie goes in depth about the life and sucess of ahmet ertegun. this special is okay it was interesting, i didn't relize that ahmet changed alot in the music industry. all i can say was that i learned something that i didn't know before and that the movie was okay. if you are into documentaries then i recommend that you see this if not then don't bother."
2,"Mediocre, at best","Two hours on Atlantic Records, and literally not one word about some of the most important music in American history: the Atlantic recordings of Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus or John Coltrane. While the pop stuff's great, these, along with Ray Charles (who is well represented here), are the very things that make Atlantic different from every other label."
5,Incredible,"With the Many Great Talents Here You can't Stop Feeling The Grooves&Vibes here.Parliament,B.T.Express,The Brothers Johnson plus Countless others make this a Very Essential Set.THis is A Timeless Set.These Songs are as fresh Today as they were when they were Released."
1,Not worth looking into,"Essentially, there is no reason to buy this. Use your mouthpiece. Really! This is a ridiculous item and a solid waste of money."
4,The Yardbirds are amazing,This CD is a peace of history - probably not for casual listening - every so often there is a hip BBC presenters voice introducing a track. the sound quality is good - as with the BBC recordings in general.
5,A Must Have CD For Any Yardbirds Fan,"A really great CD! I listen to it at work and at home. It is so nostalgic. The liner notes are excellent and gives a history of the Yardbirds, and each song listed as well. I especially love the last few tracks with Jimmy Page, because he gives each song an added flare, especially Goodnight Sweet Josephine. I also like the tracks with Jeff Beck as well, especially Smokestack Lightning. This album is well worth my money. I would recommend it to any Yardbirds fan or to those who appreciate unique music as much as I do."
5,Fully caprures Brittish 60's R&B/Blues scene. Superb.,"This is an excellent collection and representation of where The Yardbirds were at and what they were about in the early 60's. This is a wonderful piece of musical history that I highly recommend. The recording quality is reflective of 60's live music. It's the musicianship that shines through here. The Y-birds rate right there beside the Stones, The Animals and Manfred Mann. I would advise you to pick this up and enjoy the wonderful experience of 60's Blues/R&B in it's finest hour."
2,only for the hardcore,"I thought this album had potential.... unfortunately, I should have listened to the online cuts b4 ordering it. The sound quality is ""early sixties transistor radio"" and is full of those anoying discjockey overdubs and ""interviews"" we all love and cherish. Reminds me of the ""early years"" scenes from ""this Is Spinal Tap"" video, especially ""I ain't got you"" which sounds verbatim like ""Gimme sum Money""...Not recommended... buy something recorded in a decent sound studio"
4,ANNOINTED,"This album was the first album that The Christianaires did on C.G.I records and it is one of my personal favorites.Paul Porters deliverie on"" Don't leave me"" is absolutely phenomenol, and his actual re-creation of the Rev. James Cleveland classic ""Two Wings"" is a testament to Paul's unlimited vocal ability.This is a must have for all Chritianaires fans."
1,Don't buy this. It's not the REAL thing,"Do NOT buy this from buy-it-now store. It is a cheap, cheap knock-off. The ""store"" did not respond to email and, of course, there's no phone #. If you want to REAL thing do not buy this."
1,Finish Was Haphazard,"For all the touting of craftsmanship, it was really quite a sloppily painted piece. Very disappointing given the high price and high expectation. I returned it, but purchased it again when Amazon dropped the price to $15. At that price, my expectation is lower and I'm quite happy with it."
1,I'm returning it,"With shipping, I paid almost $100 for the white provencal salt and pepper mills. I purchased them directly from Vic Firth website. I'm totally disgusted with the product. The blue trim on the salt mill is smudged. And the wood on the pepper mill is not totally smooth under the paint. For this kind of money, you would expect sheer perfection. Given the sloppy appearance of these items, I have no confidence that they will last. I think Vic Firth should go back to making wooden drum sticks. I'm going to return these items and buy some high end Peugeot mills."
5,KN,Hi add performance an hp power to my 3.2 190 hp 6 cly BMW Moter .I have three K N My Corvair an my truck
2,Good for those still in grade school,"I couldn't get into it, but my 8 year old son did. These were illustrated and interesting, as they were written Pre-Zahn Thrawn trilogy. If you want star wars for young kids that are readable and have pictures, check out the darkhorse comics."
5,This book was excellent.,It was filled with excitement and suspense. It's the best of the 6 in the series. A must for SW fans.
2,Didn't fool me for a minute,"While the ""Diary of Mattie Spenser"" paints a true-sounding, not-very-pretty picture of frontier life, it fairly shouts ""This is historical fiction"". I never fully believed in the characters; except for Mattie they're not really brought to life. I agree with the reviewer who felt the author had a list of characters and plot devices that she ""ticked off"" to a not-very-surprising conclusion. But I must admit I've been spoiled. I read the magical, lyrical, clever and delightful ""These is My Words"" first."
3,"An good read, but not a great one.","I really got into this book and I had read alot of the other reviews before purchasing it. I didn't find it unbelievable at all, Mattie's trials were great, but most people trying to settle the plains' were great. I was sold on the book the first 75% of the way through and then....I felt I was let down. It's not a waste of time, just not one of my favorites."
3,trite and formulaic,"I felt like this was more of a writer's exercise in historical diary keeping than an actual diary. I liked Mattie herself but I kept thinking that the author had made a list of required elements that appear in authentic historical diaries that she checked off as she worked each into her book. Worst of all, however, was the ending. Mattie falters and loses sight of her true self and the story gets buried in a Hollywood ending."
2,The Diary of Mattie Spenser,"I enjoyed this book , but would not consider it a ""great read"". I found the content to be very interesting, but I generally do not enjoy the Diary format, and I ws a bit bored with Mattie's style. In addition, I felt as if the adventures and misadventures of Mattie Spenser were too numerous to be believable. I think that the major obstacle, besides the hard work of settling a new land, and the dangers of doing that, would have been unbelievable boredom and loneliness . I just finished Willa Cather's My Antonia, which is a classic written in 1918, dealing with the same subject, and the difference in styles is very dramatic. Cather writes literature. Dallas writes a good story."
3,"Ending isn't poignant, just sad","The story was intriguing until the last 20% or so. The tragedy, loss, and betrayal experienced by Mattie surely warranted a more pioneering ending. The story would have been far better served by having her make a complete break with her upbringing and embracing the lifestyle that she has come to know, which cares little for convention and more for survival.Johnnie deserved better than to be swept aside and forgotten for nothing. Luke is detestable and did not deserve to get just what he wanted. Instead of creating a satisfying resolution, the ending made me sorry I'd read the book."
5,Wonderful,This book gave a clear description on what prairie life was like for woman. They were isolated and worked like an animal on a farm. It just proves that prairie life for women was a lot harder than for men. I loved the book so much I gave it to my husband to read. He could not put it down.
5,VERY ENJOYABLE,I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. I FELT MATTIE'S PAIN AND HARDSHIPS.SUCH A STRONG WOMAN. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
5,best book of the year,I almost didn't download this to my kindle after reading some of the reviews. That would have been a big mistake. I could not put it down. I have been a great fan of Sandra Dalles for years.
4,Great writing,"I loved this story,I have read two of the books that Ms Dallas has written and enjoyed both very much.I will be reading more of her books."
4,Good American pioneer story,"This was a very engrossing, interesting American pioneer story. In our pampered modern times, I enjoy reading about our tough forefathers and foremothers, and this book is a great example of that genre. I liked it."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed it. Great characters.,This will be the next book turned into a movie. Strong supporting characters enhance the plot between the main characters of the story. I purchased 4 copies and gave to friends.
2,The Formula for Success,"Sandra Dallas tells good tales. The Diary of Mattie Spenser has intriguing turns. New Mercies has southern charm. Unfortunately, Dallas succumbs to decorating her books with the bric-a-brac of pseudo research--without integrating it into the tale. It glows like Mattie's silver spoons in a sod house. Dallas demonstrates no mastery of letting her characters speak --choosing rather to sprinkle the dialog with newspaper headlines and abrubt colloquialisms. One does not have to include every historical figure, building, or event in a book. Dallas has the talent to write well; it is unfortunate that she chooses formulas which no doubt drive and satisfy publishers but do not create good writing. A warning to readers--positive reviews can indicate that others have abandoned a book because it was not worth reading. Before you waste money on Dallas books, sample her writing from the local library."
4,I enjoyed this book thoroughly and couldn't put it down.,"This is a great read for those who enjoy historical fiction and have an interest in the life of a pioneer woman. The characters were engaging and the plot interesting. It was somewhat reminiscent of The All True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton, by Jane Smiley."
5,simple,"Good old fashioned read about the pioneer times, when marriage took you places and away from places. Easy to read."
3,The Diary O Mattie Spenser,"It's an ok book, just not on a par with the Prine books. Sorry. Ms Prine is the BEST! More words? Ah, enough."
3,Frontier Story Spoiled by Modern-Day Romance,"A story within a story, the meat of course being the personal diary of a young frontier wife, Mattie Spenser, setting out with her husband to settle the wilds of Colorado. In the three years chronicled by the diary, the strong yet plain Mattie deals with failed crops, Indian attack, childbirth, and multiple deaths. The crushing blow is the betrayal of her husband, Luke, a man she's come to love though she knows the feelings are not reciprocal.It's a compelling story, but disappointing. Unfortunately I smelled the trap of the ""romance novel"" as it was set. And sure enough, when it was sprung, it was a dull snap.This book lacked the surprise twists that mark Sandra Dallas' other novels. Perhaps the romance intrigue just mentioned was intended to fulfill that design, but it seemed too ""formula"" to me."
3,Easy Read,"Not my favorite of Sandra's books, but definitely an easy, enjoyable read. The story flows well, but I wish I could learn more about what happened to Mattie after the diary part concludes. Overall, though, I'd recommend this for a quick, light read."
2,Diary of Mattie Spenser,"Have really enjoyed previous books by Sandra Dallas, but this was truly a disappointment. It was so lacking that I didn't even want to pass it along to the free library!"
5,Great book-couldn't put it down,My mom suggested this book to me and I am so glad she did. I was hooked from the first page and could not put it down. Great story-great read!
5,A great read!,All of the Sandra Dallas books are a great read!! Once you start you don't want to put the book down.
3,Human Drama,This was one of my favorite Sandra Dallas books; I could hardly lay it down and was so surprised at the turn of events. Gives me a new appreciation for the ladies who traveled west to seek a better life in the 1800's.
3,Unrealistic,"I was very excited about this book and enjoyed the first half of it. It then became unrealistic. The number of deaths even for that time period was too high. I spoke with an historian about it and he agreed, while times were indeed difficult and health care virtually nonexistent, people did survive.Also the plugging in of momentous historical events in the diary was just that, they were plugged in and didn't fit in with the flow.The writing was good and it was a good read."
4,Mattie's....,"My friends and I loved this book. What trials poor Mattie went through! Dallas certainly knows how to get inside the minds of her characters. When this one ended though, I wasn't sure Mattie hadn't created some fiction to fill lonesome days on the frontier. Reading the letter written by Mattie's husband at the end of the novel causes my uncertainty. I don't know if Dallas meant to leave that kernal of doubt, if she meant to portray the difference in the way men and women perceive events, or if the ending was just a little weak. At any rate, this fictional journal is certainly worth reading if you enjoy stories about frontier life."
4,Santa Tummy,"This worked well after we shorten the neck strap. At 6' tall I did not think it would hang so low, but my spouse was able to bring it up to the right height very quickly. It has worked well for about a dozen Santa Gigs this year."
3,MY KIDS LIKE THEM,DESPITE ALL OF THE BAD REVIEWS I ORDERED THESE PHONES FOR MY 5 AND 2 YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS AND YES THEY DO HAVE SHORTCOMINGS BUT NONE OF THESE SEEM TO BOTHER THE KIDS. THE HANDSETS ARE SMALL BUT THEY MANAGE AND THE RECEPTION IS FINE THEY TALK TO EACHOTHER FROM THIER SEPERATE ROOMS ALL THE TIME.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IN REFERENCE TO THE OTHER REVIEWERS IS, DITTO.THESE PHONES ARE AWFUL, I BOUGHT ONE SET AND THEN RETURNED IT FOR ANTOHER SET AND BOTH WORKED EXACTLY THE SAME, NOT AT ALL.IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO SEE YOUR LITTLE ONES OPEN A CHRISTMAS GIFT, GET VERY EXCITED AND THEN HAVE IT NOT WORK. STAY AWAY FROM THESE PHONES. TOO BAD CONSIDERING LITTLE TIKES USUALLY HAS GREAT PRODUCTS."
1,Not good,This was a Christmas present for my 2 & 5 year olds. I'll have to agree with all the other reviews. This product doesn't work well. My kids were so excited to play with these but quickly became frustrated. I would not recommend buying this toy.
1,Very disappointed,"As the other reviewer experienced, the reception was awful. My girls could barely hear each other over the static. Plus, when you tried to ""ring"" the other phone, the wrong phone rang (the one you were dialing from). This was one of my daughters' Christmas presents, and we were all very disappointed!"
1,Bad Toy- Horrible Customer Service,"Can I give this negative stars? We got this gift as a Christmas present, my daughter (and I) loved the concept- but from the moment we opened it, it would not work. I called the company who said there was nothing they could do unless we had the receipt. They were not friendly and certainly not helpful. Since we got it as a gift from out of town relatives, we are out of luck. What a waste of plastic. This is the last Little Tikes product I will buy."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY DOESN'T WORK,"Not that I am typing anything new, but what a disappointment. My daughter cried for an hour because I couldn't get this cool idea of a toy to work. Too bad 4 year olds actually want to play with their toys rather than pretend they really work. Thumbs down to Little Tikes, they failed miserably on this one. Save your money, don't buy this....or spend more and buy your kids, grandkids...whatever some cool walkie-talkies so they can actually talk to each other and play. Brand new, this toy does not work AT ALL."
1,HOW DID THIS GET ONTO THE SHELVES!,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday Dec. 31. He cried and cried when I told him it had to go back because it was broken. Flat out - the toy does not work. The other phone does not ring when you call it - your phone rings, you cannot hear the other person talking - when it works at all (which is rarely) it sounds like the worst drive-through speaker you've ever encountered. I've been waiting for months for this toy to come out, and I honestly don't see how it made it onto the shelves because it's not like it doesn't work great, it doesn't work AT ALL. Big disappointment, and I will definitely think twice before getting another little tykes brand. We were disappointed last year with their phone with answering machine too. I'd actually give it a zero star rating if that was a choice."
1,Listen to all of us!,"As others have stated, I have had the same problems. Save you money and look for something better. I usually try to test the toys out before giving it to my kids so as to avoid the disapointment. I also returned two sets of phones and will be looking elsewhere for a better set. It would be a great toy if it worked."
1,Looks good in the box,"This is a dad review. What a Christmas bomb this was! Our boys (2 & 5) love telephones and my wife and I thought what a great gift idea. Wrong. Where do I begin? First, who at Little Tykes designed the hand pieces? Did they actually think to measure the head size of a three year old child? The mouth piece ends up on the cheek of most children, blocking the already pathetic reception these toys have. My wife and I tried them at 10 feet (putting our mouth up to the transmitter) with only occassional static bursts for voice. This is with brand new eveready alkaline batteries in. They immediately went to the shelf and I will try to send back for a refund. Save your money and use two cans and a string, it will work better."
4,Could be better,I think the idea of these phones is great but the reception isn't very good. I don't know if it is just ours but the fuzz that you hear is kind of annoying and makes for hearing the other person a little hard. I guess you can get fuzz with all walkie talkies. I'm just glad I got it as part of a buy one get one free promotion-this was my free item so at least I didn't spend any money on it!
1,Returned,I agree with the other reviews. These phones are terrible. We could hear nothing but static.Do not recommend!!!
1,Theu're baa-aack!,"I just want to confirm, this product is back on shelves and, apparently, has not received any improvement. I bought a set for my 2 and 4 year olds for Christmas, and fortunately had the foresight to test them before I wrapped them up.As others have already mentioned, these phones don't work like the product description says. When you push one of the three buttons that actually works, your own phone rings. I could not get my set to work as walkie talkies at all.I am disappointed because this concept was so great, and if they functioned I know my kids would love them. They are going back to the store tonight."
1,"If it worked, it'd be great!","I bought these last Christmas for my son since he loves to pretend talk on phones. This looked like such a great toy, but I have to agree with the other reviewers--what a bust! I don't think these EVER worked right. This was so suprising, with the great track record Little Tikes has...I love most of their products. [...]"
2,"Don't Work, But My Son Likes Them","Even though, as everyone else has pointed out, the reception is bad, and you can only push some of the buttons (WHY?) and the batteries die constantly from being left on...my almost 3 year old still really likes to pretend conversations on these phones. The fun of hearing his pretend conversations is worth at least $10 to me! LOL. I am glad however, that I got this on a buy one get one free promotion with another Little Tikes toy that we like. I do agree, this is far below typical Little Tikes quality."
5,Excellent transaction,Book was as described. Shipping was quick and packaged well. Would purchase from again.
3,Humboldt County,"I thought the acting was weak, as well as the story line. It was almost so anti-climatic that it was boring. I waited for something to happen the whole movie, and when it finally did, I was too unenthralled to care."
2,Poor Quality Production,"When you encounter problems right at the start of a movie it does not bode well for the remaining parts. Specifically the sound quality and articulation by actors varied so much that it was difficult to understand important dialogue. Add to that, that the producing studio, in taking short cuts to save money, did not offer subtitles.The characters are well developed to the point of looking as if clipped from stereotypic people stickers. For example, after 8 years of education a medical student can't pass a simple oral exam then in solace meets a singer in a bar and after a brief obligatory unseen sex scene they take it trip to a pot growing commune. He meets the stereotypic intelligentsia professional dropouts spending time smoking and looking at trees and water while avoiding obligatory law enforcement disruptions to their growing activities. In summation, there is nothing new or creative in the substance and presentation of issues in this movie."
5,modern-day The Graduate,"Great flick! Shades of The Graduate, mixed with an odyssey-type tale and maybe a dash of Doc Hollywood (!).Resists compartmentalization.The location is a major element of the film, it's almost a character in its own right.Great actors and actresses throughout, combined in a gem of a movie."
1,Poor biblical exegesis and translation,"Relying on poor biblical exegesis and translation, this book tries to sophist its way around justifying why homosexual acts are actually quite moral and in line with natural law and divine teaching while all the while proclaiming the supposed ignorance of a Church who, for lack of a better term, are supposedly in the closet.This is not serious scholarship and is rather just a sophistic and illogical attempt to circumvent Catholic teaching for the sake of moral relativism."
1,More Catholic Church bashing!,"I can't believe that anyone would believe this nonsense! This is the kind of book that may be praised by homosexuals who are trying to convince us that perverted behavior is good instead of evil, but it belongs in the trash with the rest of the garbage!"
2,Idea is great but doesn't work so well everytime,"The idea of being able to seal my dehydrated foods into canning jars with lids really appealed to me. I purchased this small mouth jar sealer because that is the type of jars I have most of.Used this with a couple jars and it worked great, on the third jar the sealer pulled the just sealed lid off the jar when removed. I wasted 3 lids trying to seal one jar and it still didn't work. If you don't mind the hit and miss of some jars sealing and other not sealing this is probably worth buying, but I think vacume packing in bags is less fustrating."
3,Regular Mouth Jar Sealer,It takes a little practice but can work well with a little patience. Read some of the other reviews that say what they did to make it work and save yourself some irritation. The vendor I bought it from was awsome!
3,Regular jar sealer problem,"I've purchased two of these, the first one I thought was just defective but upon doing more research I found the truth. The manufacturer has a design flaw in the regular jar sealer the wide mouth doesn't have. If you use an extra lid on top of the one you are sealing with, it will work every time. This means the design isn't correct and we, the consumer, are paying for it. OK, even if I think they know the problem and haven't replaced the defective jar sealers it still works if you use two lids and saves you a bunch of money and wasted food. But, you should know this before you buy it not later."
1,The regular mouth jar sealer does not work well,The wide mouth sealer works fine but this regular mouth sealer has never worked well for some reason. I tried many times but I only got it to seal a regular mouth lid twice..
4,Jar Sealer,"I have used the Jar Sealer, and yep! it seals jars. It does what I want it to do.Got to go, sealing more jars."
1,get the wide mouth one instead!,"I tried all the tricks that helpful folks recommended, but I just can't get this little sucker to work. The wide mouth version worked the first time, and every time! And you can even find half-pint wide mouth jars. So save youself some trouble and get the wide mouth jar sealer."
4,It works great if you use the trick.,"I couldn't get it to work at first so I tried one of the tricks I saw on here. When using I simply put on 2 lids instead of one. I placed the one on top upside down so it wouldn't seal to the bottom lid. It worked perfectly. The jar sealed up on the first try with no further issues. By the way, I'm using this with my seal-a-meal, not a foodsaver and it still works. If the jar ends up losing the seal I will edit my review but for now it seems to be fine. I even turned the jar upside down and shook it and the seal kept."
1,Save you money,"I received this sealer for Christmas. This thing is a POS and doesn't seal. I will have to do some experimenting to hopefully get it to work. I have not had success sealing a mason jar with a new lid. I have heated the lid in water and wiped it dry hoping that would get it to seal. No luck. I will have to try a used lid to see it that will seal. I am very disappointed!IMO, save your money."
1,Disappointed with this one.,"Does not work, well, 90% of the time at least.1. Rubber seal keeps coming off when you pull the sealer of jar.2. 9 times out of 10 this Jar Sealer keeps removing the lid when you try to remove it.On my way to returning it now."

1,Not Sealing At All,I found that the regular mouth jar sealer I have does not work because the gasket is too small to get an air tight seal. I use the hand held Food Saver but that does not affect the gasket in the jar attachment. I also did not see where to order a new seal. I am highly disappointed in the regular size sealer attachment because I absolute LOVE the wide mouth one and use it practically every day!
3,Not as reliable as wide mouth jar sealer,"After I purchased my Foodsaver, I purchased the wide mouth jar sealer to use with it. I soon discovered that all my jars were regular mouth. I then purchased wide mouth jars to use with the wide mouth sealer, and I'm glad I did. They work beautifully. Since I had a bunch of regular mouth jars on hand, I ordered this regular mouth jar sealer. It just doesn't seal the jars with the reliability of the wide mouth sealer. I don't know if it's the sealer, the regular mouth jars, or user error, but I have difficulty getting my regular mouth jars to seal with this gadget."
3,Vac head,Wish they had better instructions with this because it doesn't always work....it's VERY fussy on what it seals and doesn't !!
5,WORKS GREAT IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT,"This jar sealer is a necessity if you have a Foodsaver! Much cheaper than using those expensive canisters and it keeps your food fresh! There's nothing better than opening a jar and hearing the whoosh of air going in! Lets you know it's fresh! For all of those reviewers who had problems with it sealing, I have a tip that should eliminate those sealing problems. When you seal the jar put TWO mason lids on top, one on top of the other. Then seal the jar. The top lid should pop right off and the bottom lid will be vacuumed tight and secure! (If the top lid doesn't come off right away, just give it a few hours and it will come loose.) Not sure why it works this way, but it does! For those jars that you seal for longer than a week I would recommend checking the seal every once and a while. I have had a jar lose it's vacuum a time a two. BUT a great majority of the time it remains sealed. Highly recommend!"
5,jar sealer,"This works very well for crackers . Because it will not crush them. You only need to order one, because it seals down the steel lids on the jar. the jars you can get free with classico pasa sause then you can buy just the lids you really don't need the rings,"
3,"good idea, but a fuss","I wish I had read more of the odd reviews as I am torn as to whether or not this is a good item. I spent forever trying to get it to work originally and then went online to figure out if others had ""tricks"". I think the reason I dislike it is that it requires research to get it to work. Nothing should be this bad out of the box! If I do the two lids it works 80% of the time. Sometimes it unpops the seal, and I am wondering just how much air is actually pulled out.Widemouth is great, but regular is a pain in the butt.Heather"
4,regular mouth jar sealer,"I've been very excited about using my foodsaver, but it only came with the wide-mouth jar sealer. I ordered this regular mouth sealer online, and received it quickly. It has only two ridges under the lid to keep the jar lid on during sealing (the wide-mouth sealer has five). This causes rocking, and failure a lot of the time. I debated whether to return it or not, but opted to solve my own problem by inserting a paper clip as a third and fourth ridge under the sealer (between the sealer and the jar lid. Works fine! And it's not worth a return if you can do something this simple to fix the problem. Thanks, Linda Schank"
1,Why is this $99 when the wide mouth is less then $10?,I dont understand this price! I bought a wide mouth for under 10 bucks and i want a reg mouth too but why is it $99? That's rediculous!!!
1,doesnt work,followed instructions and very rare that it actually does as advertised... will stick to the canisters
1,"Tilia, If it's Broke...Why don't you Fix IT?","This is a defective Product, Why is it being sold? PPL just keep buying it broken.Tilia you need to fix the problem before I'll buy it."
5,A great add-on for your FoodSaver!,"It's no secret that the bags for the FoodSaver are expensive. Enter the Regular Mouth Jar Sealer. This is great for items that you want to keep vacuum sealed in between uses. Think ""dry goods"" such as beans, macaroni, corn starch, brown sugar, etc. For those that are not familiar with exactly what this does I will give a brief expanation. With this jar sealer you can take a standard canning jar, put the desired product inside, slap on a good canning jar lid, and vacuum seal it using the 'canister' button and the vacuum hose that came with your FoodSaver. You then remove the jar sealer to use again and again. As long as you are careful when removing the canning jar lid it can be used over and over again. The companion product to this is the Wide Mouth Jar Sealer which is the same but for wide mouth jars."
5,Works like a charm,I have both this regular mouth jar sealer and the wide mouth. I'm new to food storage and am finding these tools very helpful in stretching my food dollars.
5,works great,"just what I needed - seals great and even seems to work with lids that have seal that have been used in the pressure cooker - no need for ""new"" lids"
3,Some problems,Like other reviewers have said there are some problems getting the cans to seal. Just take another lid and put it upside down and it seals great. The blue seal inside does come out when taking it off the cans. I know it is for easy cleaning also. Works great with my food saver!
4,Works just fine,"Not a lot to say, it works exactly like it should. Nothing complicated, put it over the jar/cap and put your hand held pump over the hole. It does a nice job."
1,doesn't work,"This thing does NOT work - period. I tried on a clean jar/new lid a dozen times - very very carefully trying to wiggle it off of the jar lid once it was done ""sealing"" - it pulled the lid off every time like it wasn't even sealed. I called the company - they told me (and this was NOT in the directions) to use TWO lids and to ""season"" the lids by heating them in water. Odd, as the directions say the lids need to be dry... Regardless, this didn't work either. It would be nice if this worked but it doesn't. *shrugs*"
1,FoodSaver T03-0006-01 Regular Mouth Jar Sealer,"Unfortunatly this product did not work. I called the company and they sent a replacement free of charge. That one did not work either. I have one for wide mouth jars that works beautifully, so think it may be that the one for small jars just does not work right."
3,FoodSaver Regular-Mouth Jar Sealer,"The rubber liner pulls out ever time you try to pull the unit off a sealed jar and then sometimes pull the lid off that you just sealed onto the jar. I will stop using regular-mouth jars, too hard and frustrating to work with."
2,WTF,I have owned a Food Saver jar sealer for wide mouth jars for many years. It works like a champ every time. This one works less than 10% of the time.
2,Does not work well with small jars,I am not sure if this is specific to my machine but the regular mouth jar sealer does not seem to work well for smaller jars: there appears to be not enough vacuum as you release the button to keep the lid tightly sealed.
2,Nothing like the wide-mouth one!,"Like other reviewers, doesn't seal the lids as advertised. I decided to keep it after I followed the tips others gave regarding placing another lid over it. That way the bottom lid sometimes seals. Still a bit disappointed that it doesn't work well."
2,Too tight,I find that this cover is too tight and pulls the lid off the mason jar after I use the vacuum sealer and breaks the seal. The large version works much better.
5,Great Accessory,"I bought my first vacuum sealer 8 years ago and wanted a new one with a bag cutter that would store the bags inside. I bought one, but it only came with a wide mouth jar sealer so I bought this regular mouth size. It's fantastic. I get the most use out of it when I need just a portion of an onion. After cleaning the onion, I put aside the part I'm going to use, then cut the rest of it up and seal it in a jar. Whenever I need a few pieces of onion, I simply open the jar, take out what I need, then reseal the jar. That saves me a lot of time preparing dinner on work days."
3,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"There's nothing really wrong with the material, there's just not enough of it to justify the price. There are much more comprehensive resources available for each facet of the game addressed in this set."
3,Very Basic Information,"I purchased this four pack for my twin 8 year old boys who play little league baseball. For parents who have never played baseball themselves, I would say this is a great starting point. The DVD shows professional baseball players instructing young little leaguers about the basics. My boys unfortunately did not get too much out of the videos. They said the DVDs didn't teach them anything I had not already talked to them about. But at least it reiterated my instructions."
2,Excessive Shipping Charges,"Wrench was as represented. However, shipping charges were over the top! The shipping costs for a three ounce package by first class mail were ... can you believe ...$7.99!!!Be careful. This vendor is not selling a product ... it is selling shipping charges. Buyer beware!"
1,My pup hates it,"I kind of regret buying this brush because my 10 weeks old golden HATES the vibrate. She HATES the noise and she runs away from the brush whenever I present it before her. If I keep brushing her with it she would bite and bark, which is a good indication of irritation.I also have problem getting the hair off the brush because I can't get the plate with all the hair tangled together off the comb (the plate should be easy to take off, but appearently it's not!). It's just awkward and useless. Afterall I spent $40 for a normal comb and am unable to use the full out of it. A waste of money."
1,good idea.. not so much,"Nothing replaces a good hairbrush and a good bath. The ionizer doesn't do it for my pups, too loud. The bristles need to be thinner and longer. will not buy again or recommend."
5,Mondern Crooner,If you are a fan of Sinatra.....you will love Matt Dusk! It's wonderful to have young man singing the songs of the Rat Pack!
4,I like this guy! He's got a big voice!,"Long story short: I heard this guy's music after I chose ""Harry Connick Jr."" as my ""radio station"" on I Heart Radio. Interestingly enough, I prefer the original songs on this album over his covers of old standards. Back in Town and All About Me, IMHO, are the two best songs on the album. Impossible to sit still when you're listening to these. I plan to introduce Back in Town to my ballroom dance friends as a good Quickstep tune - cheeky! I prefer this album to his album, Two Shots, by a little bit - for me, that album flirted with a lounge lizard image. A Million Kisses Late is also a great tune, soft and sad. I'd like to hear more from this Canadian - and soon!"
4,Easy to listen,OK I am not a JAZZ fan. I find Micheal Buble too soothing (read sleepy when listening on the car) and Laura Fygi too technical. OK this one balances pop and jazz.. the first 2 tracks are very radio friendly while tracks like Take Me To Church In Time is technically jazz. Buy it if you are not a Jazznocrat this is very Poppy Jazz
3,Matt Dusk review,I was a little disapointed in this CD - I was expecting a much smoother and more professional sound from Matt.
2,DON'T LET THE CLEAN-CUT BOYISH LOOKS FOOL YOU...,"... because this guy has one of the most annoying singing voices I've ever heard - and annoying voices are far better suited to the alternative rock and rap idioms, not classic pop standards! The music is terrific, but the voice is like fingernails across a chalk board.So why was this guy given free reign and a huge budget to record this CD? He had access to Capitol Records' classic recording studio, he had legendary big band arranger and band leader Sammy Nestico write the charts, he had top-notch musicians and the whole nine yards, etc.... it's puzzling to think that some record label executive somewhere thought Matt Dusk's femme-ish, nasal vocal affectations were marketable for a big-band styled recording... and yet, there it is.There's no doubt that the record execs have got the right idea and the right concept, but they've totally got the wrong voice for this type of project. In any case, Michael Buble's got nothing to worry about."
3,Fun sci-fi for a rainy afternoon,"This British-made sequel to the original Fly movies starts off slowly, but picks up pace. A man and a woman meet on the road to Montreal, fall in love, and are soon married: She neglects to tell him she has just escaped from a mental asylum; he neglects to tell her he is engaged in highly dangerous experiments in teleportation; fun ensues.There are mutants, fantastic machines and scares here and there, so it's not bad. Director Don Sharp (The Kiss of the Vampire, Face of Fu Manchu, The 39 Steps) can usually be trusted to deliver a good time."
1,Useful only in very limited circumstances,"The adaptor works fine; no problem. But what Panasonic doesn't tell you is that the camera *does not* recharge its battery when it's on AC power. So the adaptor is only useful if you're working near an AC source for many hours at a time. Perhaps useful for a few users, to be sure, but useless for many of us. Save your money."
4,devastating,"This is a rich, well-written book packed with interesting characters and history. I agree the ending did feel a bit rushed and that it would have been nice to have more of Quintin's perspective in the last part of the book. This book does bring up questions of truth and perspective. Some events were a bit ambiguous, but that was the point. I'm most conflicted about Quintin-was he really responsible for so much violence? At first I wanted to believe he was a regular out of touch middle-aged man, but by the end I thought of him more as a monster. Why didn't Isabel speak out more against the fragmentation of her family?"
5,This book was recommended by a friend,"The story in this book takes place in Puerto Rico, where I lived for five years from age 11 to 16. It is beautifully written and very well crafted. It's way more than a ""romance"" book. You might call it a story of a dynasty - an important (fictional) family. It's also full of the ways of the island itself. My husband and I bought a house in Puerto Rico last year for our upcoming retirement and I read the book while in our new house. I was sad when I finished it, as I always am when I read a good book."
3,What happened at the end?,"This book has a floppy ending. It feels like Rosario Ferre rushed to get it done. I enjoyed reading about the island in the old days, and the author does a good job describing customs and philosophies. Although the story has some flaws early on, the historical details kept me quite entertained. When the story started to center more in the current family events, i became disappointed. Quintin had been a voice early in the book, but at the end he is mute, and it would have been really nice to have heard what he had to say. And Isabel, who is supposed to be such a strong person, concedes defeat several times, and weakly justifies her actions. I would recommend it only to those that want to learn more about old PR."
4,Great find in latin american fiction,"If you've cleaned the bookshelves of Garcia Marquez and love the magical reality that only a few writers can sweep their readers into, pick up this book. It has all the elements for the great read and bad movie of The House of Spirits. My only warning is that the book, in my opinion, has a terribly sad and unjust ending. But it's all part of the magic, even if the magic lets you down. I am looking forward to reading more works/translations from Ms. Ferre"
5,Perfect size for smaller amounts!,"This size bag is almost impossible to find in stores. I love this size for blocks of cheese, small fruit portions. It's the perfect size for my husband and me."
3,NOT GOOD FOR DEHYDRATED FOOD,"As we all know dehydrated food sometimes develop sharp edges these cut holes in the bag during vacuum, if you want to use it make sure your food has no sharp edgesthat's all"
1,Not so great,"My husband and I bought a Foodsaver after we got married. We ran out of the bags that came with the machine so I ordered these. The small size is great but these bags don't work! The material is too thick for the vacuum to fully suction all the air out so it doesn't work properly. I was really disappointed with these because I vacuum seal all the time when I buy any type of raw meat. Sad to say, I wouldn't recommend these particular bags."
3,Advertisement,"Advertisement? Advertisement was ""Free shipping for orders over $25.00."" My order was over this amount but bill contained a shipping/handling charge."
2,Food Saver Pint Siaze Vacuum Bags,Has anyone noticed that the food saver bags used to come packaged with 32 bags per box - now 28 and same price!
4,It is what it is.,"As is true of most of these bags, they work OK and are overpriced. I have found few uses for bags this small."
2,disappointed,very disappointed in this transaction that never took place. Why would u list an item for sale that u don't have espcially a book for college? Waited a week to contact me to say she didn't have it so i had to start all over. Most people need to know that a little sooner to make other arrangements.
5,The most useful book I've got on my shelf,"From the moment of staring at the appealing pictures and EYE-POPPING title, I was drawn into the book's methods of training.This book is a MUST for beginners and of all different levels. In the very beginning, there is a clear cut introduction and information on how the body works, muscle group information, and other tips.Progressing through the simple diagrams and instructions, I finally come upon the section that explains how to create a program. From factoring in tempo, reps, rest time, & exercises, the author clearly addresses and recommends a variety of programs for different sets of goals.Overall, a book I still always refer to. Get it now!"
5,Perfect Reminder,"This books is phenomenal for beginner and intermediate programmers alike. I got it while starting a learn from home learning crave, and it was the best asset I could have gotten. It focuses on more than just skill and note taking (which 90% of programming books are about). This book works on many things, and tries to get multiple aspects of programming/Structure, organization, and pragmatism in your head to help.It has examples galore and is incredibly easy to read. It has been all over the net as the GO-TO book for programmers. Sometimes as a programmer, you work some much on your projects you forget to have some thought out dialog on methods, and the book pokes fun at it a bit. It goes in at points to talk about the depth and methodology to programming as a whole, giving you arguments for varying opinions.A+. Any programmer should get it!"
4,Excellent book that needs to brought up to date,"I enjoyed reading ""The pragmatic programmer"". It transcends process and discusses the fundamental aspects of software development. The book provides time and ""buzz-word"" invariant common-sense observations and tips about the practice. They are presented in a clear and straightforward manner, complete with many examples of actual code and actual tools. And herein lies my criticism. The code and tools are out of date. At this level of detail, they should be brought up to date."
4,"Great book, great advices",I absolutely enjoyed this book. Really enjoyed the humor in it & some of the advices have become my second nature. A must read for anyone in software development field or considering entering it.
3,Good book but just too wordy.,"The reviews I read about this book are pretty accurate, except this book is too wordy. It could be 1/2 the size it is if the authors would have gotten to the point faster. A lot of explanations go on and on and I am left wondering when am I going to get to read what the point is?! Get to it!The two authors are certainly qualified to author this book, judging by what their backgrounds are. For the most part, the chapters are interesting, informative, and thought provoking. Most of the ideas are not what the average, or above average programmer would think of.Some of the ideas though are not worth the paper to print them on, and many of them are not explained well enough. Given the amount of words for explanations, this should not have been. Therefore, I can only give this book three stars. Overall I feel that the book is too drawn out and not to the point enough."
3,"""Rookie"" (pragmatic) programmer","Pros: well written, 100% valuable pragmatics, great analogies (comparing programming with gardening), useful, pleasant exercises, with well explained solutions.Cons: Any serious developer going through a couple of serious projects already knows most of this. In that sense I see this book more as a tutorial for the ""rookie"" (pragmatic) programmer. And when it comes to design rules and pragmatics I found much more solid, universal and valuable: ""The Art of Unix Programming"" by Eric Steven Raymond, amazingly enough available on-line at: [...]"
3,"Good checklist of tips, falls short","I like this book for the most part. I find it falls short in describing a good (appropriate) use of Architecture Specifications, Design Plans, etc. This is especially true for those who are self-taught or went to school years ago and may not have been exposed to this kind of development process. While the author's approach may be great for some, experience has shown me that whether I'm working in a large team environment or by myself, having good requirements, architecture specifications, and development plans do a lot to kill programming bugs before they occur, and more importantly, serve as a compass for the code-writing portion of the development process, no matter what the size of the coding team. I think readers will probably benefit more by reading ""Code Complete"" 2nd Ed. (2004) by Steve McConnell."
5,One of the top 5 programming books,"For me, 'The Pragmatic Programmer' joins 'Code Complete', 'Design Patterns' or 'Refactoring' among the books every programmer should read (at least twice). It is packed with wisdom and introduces concepts referred throughout our body of knowledge. 'Tracer bullet', 'Tell, don't ask' or 'Learn a new programming language every year' are just some of the concepts The Pragmatic Programmer implanted in my mind.Definitely a 5-star."
5,"If you're serious about software, just read this book.","Someone said to me today:""Humans have been humans for a long time now, but we don't seem to be getting any better at it.""The statement struck me because it is clear, concise, and absolutely true; So is this book. What's more, this book tells you how to be a better human.The Pragmatic Programmer explains, step by step, how to master the craft of programming. It describes tricks, techniques, but more importantly *attitudes* that most people learn the hard way over several decades- if at all. What's more, it lays it all out in a neat, approachable, and immediately applicable way that is independent of specific technologies and languages.I've been looking for many years for a book like this to give students. Now I've got it. It'll go on my shelf next to ""The Mythical Man Month"" and will probably be popular and applicable for just as long."
4,Generally helpful advice and practices,"Some of the items may seem like common sense to the reader. If so, congratulate yourself on being intelligent and informed. I found the 'test first, test often' information to be very helpful.If you have a development team, purchase this book and encourage them to read it."
2,Nice book but too shallow,"The Pragmatic Programmer is a book that describes a no non-sense approach to programming. The book covers a lot of ground, from work philosophy, to coding practices to testing to project management. The book offers good advice. The style is engaging. However I am still very disappointed by the book. Why? I found that most topics are better dealt with in other books and chapters are often too short to really do justice to the topics. For example, work philosophy is better handled in 'Please Don't Just Do What I Tell You, Do What Needs to Be Done', coding and testing are much better handled in 'Code Complete', patterns by the gang of four.The Pragmatic Programmer is a nice book for starting programmers or for a fun read. But the return on investment is very low for a professional programmer."
1,Typical Attention seeking book ....,"You can put this book into the category of books like - 'Teach yourself programming in 21 days', '20 recipes to success'. The books which don't have anything in them and just trying toseek attention. This book doesn't have a strong foundation and grabs all these universal, common sense tips and bunches them together.I would not recommend buying this book to anyone."
2,This one is for non programmers,"I was planning to buy this book. But before buying, I checked it out on Google Books. This one is certainly not for the programmers but for the people who claim to be programmer. If you are a programmer, you don't do finger pointing when you or someone else discovers a bug in your program. You just get down to work with debugger. And in fact you learn a lot while debugging. So if you are a serious programmer (not just by some designation at your work), you don't need it."
5,Absolute Must-have!,"This book is an absolute must-have for any software developer worth his/her salary or billable hours.""The Pragmatic Programmer"" is filled with everyday scenarios and advice that any developer can begin to apply the first workday after beginning this book.It is definitely a purchase you won't regret."
5,Excellent tips for all programmers,"In this book Hunt and Thomas have compiled a collection of 70 tips, thoughts, and techniques that are a must-study for every programmer regardless of skill or experience.The tips cover all programming topics. Issues include programming style, languages, time management, planning, customer relationships, and spotlights on the project lifecycle. Some of the tips in the book seem obvious, but are often forgotten even by experienced programmers. Some tips are things that I initially was surprised by, but after reading the thorough explanation the topic came to light and became clear.This is a good book that can be read off and on in sections, picked up at any time for a quick refresher on good programming.I would heartily recommend this book for all programmers, whether you're a casual dabbler in VB, a web perl scripter, or you write unix system utilities in C."
4,This is a rare kind of book...,"I'm an entry level software developer and I have to say that this may be one of the most important books in my career. I've been ""playing around"" with software development since my mid-teens and now it's my full-time job. I bought this book this afternoon and I haven't wanted to put it down - it's written in an easy to read, sensible manner. It isn't boring - which is really hard to do with any technical book. If all my development/technical books were only 1/2 as good as this one at keeping your attention - I would be a much more informed individual."
2,A mile wide and an inch deep,"As an experienced software developer, I was looking for a book that I could recommend to more junior members of my team to help them improve their skills. This book wasn't it. Although this book has a lot of very good advice in it, it's mostly a mile wide and an inch deep. For a junior developer not already familiar with these ideas, there isn't enough meat here for them to gain any real appreciation or understanding of the material.In contrast, take Code Complete. It's *only* a book about code construction, a small portion of what Pragmatic Programmer tries to cover. And yet, Code Complete weighs in at nearly 900 pages, versus Pragmatic's 300 or so. The difference is detail. Code Complete really digs into each topic, explaining it completely and giving examples. It's a bigger read to be sure, but when you're done, you have truly learned something. When you finish Pragmatic Programmer, you're left wanting another book that actually explains everything you just read."
5,great book,book is really good and very on point. you will feel like he is almost talking to you.highly recommended for anyone who works in the software industry
4,"A must for junior programmers, good reference for senior developers","This book is well written and contains valuable information about software development and practices.It is highly recommended if you are starting in this field as this will set you up and get you going in the right direction.If you are, however, an experienced software developer you can quickly skim through it. There was very little new for me. My colleagues and I already follow many of the practices mentioned in the book. It is good to have it on a bookshelf as a reference anyway."
4,Good book... some problems on Kindle,Good book but the Kindle version has some bugs... sometimes it jumps to unexpected places when you try to go to the next page.. It does not happen to other books I have on the same Kindle just this one.
5,The best book on programming ever written,"...and normally, I don't use cliches. If you need to read only one book on programming methodologies - read this one.You can regard it as a ""professional self-help"" book. It really helps you to grow professionally. Even though it is pricey - in long range what you learn from this book will make you a better programmer (and, yes, better paid). Pragmatic Programmer is not only for coders; project leaders can benefit even more from it.The format is excellent and easy to read as well. While every claim is thoroughly explained, the essence of the advice is put in one sentence.Some of the stuff is a programmer's common sense; unfortunately, it is not taught in universities. And even though many people might think they know it - usually they don't.Seems like everyone has his own favourite part in this book; mine is DRY - don't repeat yourself."
5,Satisfied customer in Atlanta,I purchased this book for a love one who is a computer programmer/architect for fathers day. He has just been promoted to a new position where this book plays an important role. He has been very pleased with the book.
5,Delicious! Inexpensive! Quick! Satisfying! A great book.,"I own about 35 vegetarian cookbooks, and decided to stop buying any more. However, finding a variety of good soups that I could center a meal around has never been easier once I gave in and purchased this book. I've so far prepared about fifteen recipes, and enjoyed each and every one, and plan to make them all again. This may be the one cookbook that I eventually prepare all of the recipes therein. A MUST HAVE cookbook...you won't regret the purchase. Your mouth, stomach, wallet, and pocketbook will all thank you regularly for your wise decision!"
4,Panasonic KX-TG2422,Phones are small. Have clear sound with handset and handset speakerphone. A good buy.
4,Good Phone a little too Small,"good phone, ok signal inside not great outside. no interference, but the unit itself is very small and difficult to have a long conversation on"
3,A Fine Phone,"Generally, the phone is fine. It will be better if it comes with some convenient features. First, it does not have a clock. Often, a phone will sit on a table, desk, or night stand. If the phone has a clock, it will be very convenient to its users. Second, it does not support ear-phone. When people talk over phone for a long time, they wish their hands can be free, thus earphone is usefull. Third, this phone somehow looks like a toy. That is why I rated it 3 stars."
4,No Speed Dial,"Very nice phone, much better than the AT&T one I had before. But no speed dial...or have I not discovered it yet? Still a good buy."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Just because it is a Panasonic brand,does not mean any thing good. Voice clarity is very bad. Baterries does not charged for more than two hours even not in use. I'm very happy with my other Panasonic phones."
1,Lack of headset feature,"Lack of the headset feature makes this phone a bad choice. Even my under $10 cordless has the headset jack feature. In addition to this lack of what I would consider a standard feature, the reception quality is terrible. There is a constant degree of static on all calls I have made. I have tried all the adjustments, consulting the manual and nothing changes it. After replacing the phone with another model, I have absolutely no static on the line, so it is obviously this phone. Both handsets.I will be returning this purchase."
1,Disappointing Audio Quality,"Conceptually this phone system seems good, with some clever electronics, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The worst feature is the dreadful microphone used in these handsets, which adds a fuzzy distortion to everything. Since both handsets sound identical on a third phone one can only surmise the quality problem with the microphone is on all of these phones. Immediately noticeable in all calls, this is particularly embarrassing in conference call settings when other participants will ask you to call back in with a different phone. If you have a home office you would do well to avoid this phone. I also want to confirm the lack of a headset jack."
2,Why only 2 stars?,"Don't get me wrong.....the book is full of interesting information and facts, but the read is rather dry, and I lost interest numerous times before finally finishing. The Medicine Wheel gives a rather comprehensive overview of Earth Astrology as viewed by the Chippewa Shaman Sun Bear and Wabun (Sun Bear's Medicine Helper). Sun Bear has written numerous articles and papers, so his writing is held in fairly high esteem. Still not one of my most enjoyable or readable books. Recommended with reservation."
2,Not a good buy,"I purchased this as an extra for the craft room and it has not been used nearly as much as the other tvs in the house, in fact, it has actually been used a lot less. The picture has always been grainy, the color was not easy to adjust either, but now the color is going completely on it. I will try to get it fixed, it was not cheap (in my opinion) with a lousy warranty, but I would probably be better off replacing it with something else. I am really tired of purchasing ""disposable"" stuff!"
3,"Pretty Good TV, For What It Is","We got this TV using ""Wedding Gift Money"" to place in our kitchen while making dinner and eating. It works out pretty well. We have not really used the DVD player, but I did test it, and it seemed to make a nice picture, and work decently well.The picture quality isnt bad, it is a little grainy, however I am certain that its the cable line coming in becuase the DigitalTV channels it picks up are clear as day.I do not like the remote control, it is not set up very nice, and creates some confusion at first, and slow to respond, but other then that, all in all we are satisfied with it.I would recommend it to anyone who needed an extra TV to use in a small room."
1,NOT Compatible with Direct TV,"From what I have read in my extensive research (internet) there is NO code that will work with this TV to make it compatible with Direct TV or any other universal remote. It works okay as a DVD player and it does have a VGA port so it's my emergency backup computer monitor but, as a TV, it was a complete waste of money."
5,Best I have heard in long time,"With out a doubt, some of the best British Blues I have heard, Mick Taylor, and Eric Clapton just add to the wonder of it all. This cd is worth being in anyone's collection if you love the Blues."
3,Clapton a Disappointment,"Eric Clapton is either the most hard headed guitarist on the face of the planet....or he just doesn't have a clue! What a fantastic opportunity, on Mayall's 70th birthday celebration, for him to break out his Gibson Les Paul and let us hear some of the old guitar tones and songs from the old Bluesbreakers LP that changed the face of blues/rock guitar back in the late 60's! This CD is ok, but could have been a milestone in blues/rock history.. Any Mayall fan will know what I mean. This was a great opportunity missed."
1,Stinky Blues,I own quite a few Mayall albums over the years and I must say that this one is a stinker. The tunes are wornout and sour-pussed. Mayall is 70 going on 99. His armpits are too sweaty to play properly. Upon hearing this lame attempt at music I wondered how this old man even managed to stand up for the entire performance. My bet is that it was two or three or maybe even five nights of performances whittled down to this gunk. Sometimes I wondered if Mayall was even on the album. Just [...]
4,"Does the job, no hassle","I wanted a replacement shower head that was not overly expressive, if you know what I mean. Other products I can get from local Walmart was either packed with a hose or to extravagant-looking. Although I think $13 is not so much of a ""bargain"" price (hence one star off), this shower head is simple and easy to use. I simply screwed it onto the hose I had and it was done. Water pressure of the spray is modest. I wouldn't ask much more for a replacement stuff. (Although I wonder if I'm going to use the water stopping feature very much)"
4,Exactly what I needed.,"After buying a vacation home, I needed to fix the shower-head in the master bath. The existing one used the pin/pole system, and all I could find in the home improvement centers were complete replacement kits. I needed only the head to replace the original owner's Alson which was full of lime accretion that could not be removed. The new Delta head is perfect, and increased the pressure of the shower (the whole house is set to a lower pressure). It was easy to install with no tools required. My only complaint is that the new button (which slows the flow of water to a trickle) is much more sensitive than the old one was. Otherwise I would have given this item five stars."
3,Common sense...not that impressive,I bought both the books of Cal newport on college success. How to become a straight-A student seemed more detailed and helpful.this one was just common sense and I really didn't feel like it helped me a bit.
5,Enlightning,"This book enlightened me.Many things I never knew, or just hadn't though of yet are here, plus a few not so important ones, but overal it has enough depth to compensate.I especially agree with the part about socializing, how it opens so many opportunities. Though some of the other stuff in it did not apply to me personaly, I had already done, or already do, those things, it can be helpful to many people."
2,"BEFORE you purchase this as a gift, you should know...","This is a ""gift"" sort of book and I bought this as a graduation gift for a friend's child. I decided not to give the book after all because there were pieces of advice in it that I simply didn't want to be responsible for giving. I wouldn't tell my own child (or anyone else's child) not to read everything the professor assigns, and that is what this book advises. It also advises students to read a newspaper every day, and make your bed. While this is good general life advice, I'm not sure its all that important for college. I was looking for a book that tells students what I wish I had known before I went to college- like how to tell who the good professors are, what classes to stay away from- you know, stuff you'd rather not learn the hard way. I eventually found what I was looking for- The Secrets of College Success by Lynn F Jacobs. All my grads will get that one next year."
1,"Buy Newport's ""How to be a straight A student"" instead","I've got 3 Cal Newport books: How to win at college, how to be a straight A student, and how to be a high school superstar. How to be a straight A student teaches how to study efficiently so that time can be spent sociallzing. How to be a high school superstar teaches how to find your interests and to develop high-level, less-common experiences. In contrast to the other 2 great books, how to win at college is rather lame. It's a list book which give such trite advice such as ""get enough sleep,"" ""exercise,"" ""go to class."" I do not recommend this book."
5,Great philosophical advice,"There are tips in here that greatly aid the stressful student. I use this book as a reference whenever I feel stressed, and look at the tips ""Ignore your G.P.A. and 'Have no Regrets'"" As a perfectionist and a stressful worker, I always forget the great philosophical advice in this book. What I've learned is to lose my obsession over grades by facing the true reality that life is short. Demanding such perfection would lose that divine privilege, and youth is even shorter. Having no regrets taught me to live life with a keen eye for possibility and opportunities rather than having an obsession over success. This view makes life exciting and less stressful.Whenever I forget these tips and end up being so stressed, which I will, I will always have this book in hand to save me."
5,Great Graduation Gift!,"I bought many copies of Cal's book for friends, relatives, people I know who are graduating, and, of course, myself. To put it simply: This book is life-changing! Every single person I've given the book to has loved it (even 'unmotivated' students who I thought wouldn't read it). As a gift or for your own reading pleasure, this book will not disappoint!"
5,"College is too expensive to settle for ""surviving"" it. You've got to win!","Why oh why couldn't this book have been around when I was in college! Life would have been so much easier. I've given it to every high schooler and college friend, relation, acquaintance. I'm even trying to donate copies to my alma mater for their entering freshman. By far the best book on what it takes to be a standout in college. Full of practical advice, and all of it is within a student's reach. Highly recommended."
4,Great Little Read,"The book is a quick read - but that doesn't take away from some of it's powerful messages. Although i didn't treat every piece of advice as gospel (Take on research projects, Always try to become president of clubs) it does have a few pieces of advice that I will keep in mind throughout my college career, such as ""Start fast and end slow"". Overall, I think this book is a worthwhile read (why not, it's only 200 pages or so) but should definitely be a book that only adds to your collection of college strategy books and not be viewed as a collegial Rosetta Stone."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it!",Wonderful peppermill. The ones I have used in the past were cheap and didn't really grind the pepper the way I wanted for cooking purposes. I checked into the Peugeot's but wasn't willing to pay the price for the same lifetime warranty. I highly recommend this product!
5,Excellent grinder,"I bought this for my brother and sister in law, and it is terrific. Really nice shape, and excellent grinding action. Works very well. Anyone who likes freshly ground pepper like me will love this. Enjoy."
5,Pepper Mill does the job.,"The internal workings are well made. I like how easily it adjusts for making different types of grounds. I have just began using it, so do not know how durable the unit is, but everything does appear to be well made. Also, like the black as it stands out for ""pepper""."
5,BE is at it again,"The leader in providing information on black business has took it to the next level with the black enterprise guide to starting your own business. The book outlines the steps needed to reasearch opportunities and make descions. This guide takes your step through step to starting, maintaining, growing a business."
2,"Dissapointed with thermostat, don't know if that part is real from ""Gates""","The thermostat has no any marking on a body like a Part#, manufacturer logo or a temperature to open set point. No rubber ring. Also is no jiggle valve as is in OEM thermostat(I think is important for the Montero). The part# is only on the Gates non-sealed cardboard package. You can only guess if it's real part from ""Gates"" or some swapped cheap staff in a ""Gates"" package. Dissapointed with thermostat purchase, don't know if that part is real from Gates stock."
5,As good as the Afters CDs,"I recently became obsessed with the Afters. I have all of their cds on continuos loop in my cd changer. After looking them up on wikipedia I learned of this lesser know cd. I took a risk and ordered it. I was very impressed and am absolutely blown away by a few of the songs on here. A few of the songs will sound familiar to those who own the I wish we all could win cd, but I have to say I actually like these versions a little better! Their is a chord change in the 4th song ""You"" that is just mind blowing and sounds amazing. Also, the song Perfect and Beautiful has such a catchy chorus to it. This song appears to be the pre-cursor to ""Ocean Wide"" which was one of their bigger hits off the Never Going Back to Ok cd. Do not hesitate to buy this. I have listened to it for 2 weeks straight non stop and only like it more each time."
1,love these when they work. Neither of the replacements I ordered worked.,I originally ordered the chime and paw. It was great for about a year. Then the paw didn't work ccorrectly so I ordered 2 replacements. Neither worked with the chime. Very disappointed and so is my dog.Skyskyblu
4,Does the Job,"Great little tool. Very easy to train the dog--assuming you have easily trainable dogs. Haven't had any problems as some reviews have noted, but it's pretty new for us."
2,Save your money,Save your money and hang a bell low enough on your door for your dog to reach. Cheaper. More reliable. Never needs batteries. Won't break. More pleasing sound.
1,Did not work when I got it...,I would not recommend this... it was very cheap made.. and would not work after I got it.there was another review that said when they recieved it it did not work.I should have listened to it.. I WOULD HIGLY RECOMMNED BUYING SOMETHING ELSE.
1,didn't work,I thought this would be a great way to train my puppy to ring the chime when she had to go out. I was so excited to get it... and the chime didn't work. Oh Well!
4,Creative product but takes a while to train,"I have a two and a half year old Havapoo (half Havanese, half Poodle). She learned how to press the paw on command in about two days. It's a great device but I wish the area that gives out the sound was a bit bigger and a bit more touch sensitive. There were times when she pressed the side or she wouldn't press hard enough, and she would wonder why she was not getting rewarded. It took her a few days to learn how to press it using the right pressure. Anyway, overall, it's a neat product. She is now pressing it proactively to get us to take her outside for potty."
2,OK,The item works but the quality is very low. It is made out of cheap plastic and I found paper stuck inside. The bell rings randomly as others have noted. The random ringing happens if the button gets stuck down. It doesn't always pop back up after it is pushed. It isn't even waterresistent for those thinking of putting it outside.
1,My Pups Just Didn't Get How To Use This Product,"I was really hopeful about this product working. I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8. I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button. They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it."
3,Works great until it doesn't!!!,"Had 4 pet paws and one chime for about 2 years, then all the paws just quit working...I now have a dog that has gone back to scratching the doors! I'll try it one more time, but when they quit working it is extremely irritating, and frustrates the dog, also."
2,Pet Paw Chime,"In December 2002, I purchased the pet chime and paw & two additional paws. I was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks. In the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by Lentek. They're great, IF THEY WORK!"
2,Short lifespan,"I bought the pet paw and receiver around a year ago, and I only have negative things to say about the pet paw, since the receiver seems to be working fine. After a few months of use, the button became loose and would usually get stuck in the depressed position, causing the receiver to ring continuously. We had our button outside the door on a screen porch, and I believe it was dirt getting in the crack around the button that caused it to stick. Before it died completely, a new 9V battery would last only a couple weeks before needing replacement, I assume because it was in a constant transmitting state.Make the button a little more durable for large dirty paws (my dog tends to hit the button repeatedly as he sees me and eagerly awaits the door opening) and I would buy this product again in a heartbeat."
1,Lentek pet paw,"The Lentek Pet Paw, part of the Pet Chime system by Lentek, is a great idea that is badly engineered. Years ago, our dog was successfully trained to use the Pet Paw, despite the fact the only way to get it to work is to step on one little part of it, and even that often doesn't work. The Pet Paw often becomes dysfunctional when wet or frozen, because water can seep in around the edges of the part the dog has to step on. It must be kept in a plastic freezer bag to remain workable. The battery is hard to change because it is wedged in so tightly, and whenever there is a problem (which is often) the first thing we have to check is that battery. We have had to replace the Pet Paw many times. This product needs to be redesigned to be less cute and more functional. Stepping on ANY part of it should easily trigger the remote chime, and the top surface should be in a single piece that doesn't have cracks that water can enter."
5,The Boundless Frontier,An excellent review of early American History. I'm looking forward to the second part. Mr. Wall has a way of catching the essence of events without overburdening them with detail. His sense of humor lightens the subject matter while at the same time keeping it in context. His sidebars are a welcome innovation. I think this book would be of interest to older readers (as I am) interested in a refresher course as well as to those grappling with the basics of this fascinating subject.
3,Decent Stool for the Money,"The stool is good for shop/garage use only. Works well for my benches that are of varying heights. Assembly is easier if you throw the instructions away and just look at the picture on the box. The center mount had an incompletely drilled hole that I had to drill out. Quality control is poor. Once assembled, the stool operates adequately, but does have a tendency to lower in height when you sit on it depending how much you weigh. You can purchase this directly through Northern's website for cheaper shipping. $12 instead of $20 on Amazon."
2,You get what you pay for...,"The prcie is cheap and so is the stool. Beyond difficult to assemble if you try to read the instructions, the stool is off a bit and is uneven despite numerous tweaks. The seat and backrest material is glossy and very slippery. This is in contrast to what is pictured. I cannot find a better stool for the price, but there is a reason it is so cheap."
2,sturdy but uncomfortable,"This is a good value, a bit of a pain to assemble, but when it comes down to it, it's very uncomfortable to sit in."
2,Don't buy this from Northern Tool Supply,This is another one of those products made in China that almost comes complete. It was missing 2 important bolts and Northern could not supply those but gave me the option to return the whole chair. I went out and found the proper size bolts at the hardware store but it would have been nice to have the ones that you can turn by hand as well as not having to deal with the hassle.
4,Good Value,This stool is a good buy for the money. Assembly instructions could be better and the back is a little low and lightly padded. but for the price it's a good sturdy stool.
2,Not impressed,"I'm not someone who likes their coffee to get up and walk away so I don't want it strong, but I do want to taste the coffee. I went by the reviews here when I ordered the pods, but after drinking 2cups I have to say I'm not impressed. With one pod it's weak, with two it's a little better, but that's expensive. Since my little coffee maker does great with other pods I have to believe the problem is with these pods and not the coffee maker."
2,Kona Blend should be called expensive Columbian Blend,"The pods work well with the Senseo coffee maker, but the Kona Blend tastes like watered down Folger's. I tried the Moka Java flavor and it's much better"
1,Waste of Money,"If you're reading this review, you have access to the internet and don't need this book. About 99% of the information in this book can be found on the internet. And the remaining 1% isn't worth the book's price. You're better off surfing Tarantino websites and forums. And if you're a contributor to Tarantino forums, chances are Holm ripped off some of your observations and is trying to sell them back to you.I was really looking forward to this book and bought it the first day it was released. I was greatly disappointed when I read it. The previous reviewer was right. It's lazy and superficial. And definitely overpriced. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,"Best boxing, scam movie ever","Even though you go in knowing the outcome - - there are enough twists, turns and surprises to make the movie interesting.Great ensemble cast.One of my favorites!"
5,DVD viewing,This was a gift for my husband. He had looked at all the stores and couldn't find it. Amazon always has what I'm looking for in DVDS. My husband has enjoyed this movie very much. For all you James Woods fans I would recommend this DVD highly!!!
2,No Way,"With more than two thirds of this movie in the ring as part of a bet whereas rundown 'Honeyboy' whats-his-name has to knock out 10 of Diggs County's best fighters, you'll need to have a great appreciation of say, the WWF to enjoy this film. Seriously, this is the World Wrestling Federation for the boxing ring and a full fledged Hollywood movie. Comparable to ""The Sting""? I think not. And don't hold your breath waiting for that 'surprise ending' - you already know what's gonna happen, and it does. Save your cash."
4,Underrated boxing movie,"I have loved Diggstown since I first saw it as a kid. I don't know why I waited so long to get the DVD. Sure, it's cheesey in parts, but it's overall just a great boxing movie and really fun. Is it Rocky? Of course not, but it doesn't set out to be. It balances comedy and drama very well, so the few serious/dramatic parts really hit home without taking away from how funny the rest of the movie. And the ending is great. If I saw the movie for the first time now, I might be find it obvious, but I remember being completely surprised when I first saw it, and I still love it to this day."
3,"""Rockford Files"" Meets ""Dukes of Hazzard""","Although its genre is ""comedy"", you will be hard pressed to find many laughs in ""Diggstown"" (1992). The fights scenes won't make you forget ""Raging Bull"" but they are nicely staged and relatively entertaining.The film is really just a long episode of ""The Rockford Files"", without James Garner. Rockford regulars James Woods and Louis Gossett Jr. have the two biggest parts as they run a Rockford- style con on Bruce Dern-who plays a slim version of Boss Hogg.Woods bets Dern that his aging fighter (Gossett) can defeat ten opponents in 24 hours. Heather Graham fans should not expect much, she looks great but her part is very small and seems tacked onto the story as an excuse to get her name associated with the film. Oliver Platt (""Ready to Rumble"") and Gossett give the strongest performances.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
5,Diggstown delivers a Knockout!,"Probably one of the greatest con artist movies in the history of film, Diggstown delivers a knockout in entertainment and suprises.James Woods plays an outstanding professional con man opposite a sinister and intelligent Bruce Dern. Dern is so elegantly evil in a wise southern gentleman way and provides a master class in ""evil leader"". Oliver Platt does an outstanding job in the opening bar scene, where the mammoth con begins, and is very humourous througout. And Gossett plays his usual calm common man tough guy that has made him a staple in cinema for years.The ending is breathtaking!Cinemaphiles will love how the story is told. Boxing and MMA fans will love the fights. If you've seen it once, you need to see it again. If you haven't seen it, get it now. The movie delivers!"
4,"Just, To Damn Funny...","I purchased this DVD by mistake (I thought I was purchasing a cookbook) and was pleasantly surprised. I have seen other DVD's by comedians, but this one was actually funny. I laughed so hard I peed all over the couch (The dog will not even sit next to be ). It looks like it was shot at a local Miami night spot, the comics were unknown to me, but the comics made up for it with there quick wit and there humorous style. I would watch this over Last Comic Standing any day."
1,not even worth ONE STAR,"This was the most disappointing, badly filmed, UNfunny, unprofessional, and painful comedy work I've ever seen or heard in my life. My taste runs all the way from the Marx Brothers to Sam Kineson, the Blue Collar Comedy tour to Johnny Carson, Whoopi Goldberg and Bobcat Goldthwait to my all-time favorite Robin Williams. I own an entire bookcase of comedy DVDs, and this is the only time in my life I threw something in the garbage. It was THAT bad. Don't waste your money, and if it's too late for that, don't waste your time and energy. THIS IS THE WORST!"
4,A good beginners guide,"The concept behind ""Teach Yourself Visually..."" is to illustrate rather than write out the lessons. Since most people learn visually the concept seems interesting. The best desription I can think of is a classroom in a book. If you were taking a class to teach you Dreamweaver 3 your instructor would more than likely show you screenshots to walk you through the lesson. That is what this book does, walk you through the lesson visually.Unfortunately, the visual concept seems to be light on explanations, especially when there are exceptions. Also, in a classroom setting you have the luxury to ask an instructor any questions, you can't with this book.This is a great book for the absolute Dreamweaver beginner. I would recommend you use this book in conjunction with the ""Dreamweaver 3 Bible"". This will get you up and running, while the DW3 Bible will help answer more complex questions."
5,Great introductory book!!,"This is, in my opinion, the best introductory book for Dreamweaver 3 on the market! If you know nothing about the program, you will definitely have working knowledge after going through this book. It makes it so easy!! This book along with the Dreamweaver 3 Bible is all you need to master this program. If you already know it, just get Dreamweaver 3 Bible. If you don't know Dreamweaver at all, GET THIS BOOK!!"
5,This book really delivers!,"This book is extraordinarily effective. Without those long-winded discussions (and incessant distractions) that plagued most computer learning books, this one made learning Dreamweaver extremely easy. I've basically learned it in a 2 hour sitting (i do have a little bit of Basic HTML background though). Each lesson is visually very pleasing and very VERY easy to follow. If you would like to learn Dreamweaver by yourself, you should definitely check out this book first. Good Luck!"
1,Almost worthless. Truck drivers: DONT LOOK!,"Cheap Made-In-China crap. If only product engineers would actually try using their creations in the real world, we'd be soooo much better off.The shackle is covered in a clear vinyl with square-shouldered ring seals at each end (see my photos). The HUGE problem is that these ring seals slide all over the place when you try to apply this lock. If you're a truck driver and looking for a weather proof trailer lock, THIS IS NOT IT!! Within 2 or 3 lock/unlock cycles you'll have lost at least one of the ring seals as they get pulled off when you slide the shackle through the eyes of the latch hasps on your trailer.Any engineer with half a brain would have captivated the seals within the main body housing instead of cheaping out an slipping them like washers onto the shackle.If you want to lock something long-term, this item may meet your needs, but if need to apply & remove this lock more than once a month, you're gonna want something way better."
5,Well made and a good buy,"There's not much to say about cables, the molded ends are well designed for bending stress relief and being snagless, and the cables are well made at a very good price from this seller."
2,Mesh Lingerie Delicates Wash Bag 2-Pack - Household Essentials #121-2,"Mesh Lingerie Delicates Wash Bag 2-Pack - Household Essentials #121-2, I find that it does not work to my satisfaction."
3,Good for delicates but not for bras,"They are a fairly nice size, and work well for some delicates, I am not happy with them for washing bras, though. Even though I fasten the bra hooks before I put them in the bag, sometimes they come unfastened in the washer. The mesh of these bags is too big and the bra hooks get caught in the mesh. Sometimes it's hard to get them out."
3,Not good for underwear,"I put my underwear and nylons in this to wash my ""delicates"". There were only a few items so it had plenty of room for all of the items to be washed. When I pulled it out I noticed that my underwear was not clean! What's the point of using a mesh wash bag that doesn't get the items clean??!!?? I will give it one more shot with just one pair of underwear in the huge bag. If there is a change, I will update my review shortly. If not, save your money."
2,late shipment,"The item arrived one week later than was specified. I did get the item, but think it should arrive near the time predictided, not one week late."
2,mesh laundry bag,"This mesh laundry bag is NOT adequate for washing Bra's. The holes are too big and bra hooks get caught and one must disentangle them to get them out. I purchased these online because I was frankly too lazy to drive to the Macy's/Bon to get my usual fine laundry bags, the other major weakness of these bags is that eventually the zipper gives out from multiple washing and drying, welcome to the world of enhanced entropy."
3,big holes,The mesh has larger holes than some of the other bags I have used. If you have something with hooks on it they will get stuck in the mesh.Otherwise it works well for larger things.
4,it's just ok,Seems to work fine. The only problem is that the mesh is starting to unravel already. It's probably not the highest quality material and stitching but it was cheap enough.
2,won't stay closed,"I had to replace my last delicates bag when a tear allowed everything to fall out mid wash, well these don't do much better. The zipper has a tendency to open mid wash allowing everything to spill out."
3,"Functional, Cheap, Useful, But Not Very Durable","This wash bag for delicates is easy to use, can fit plenty of garments and is cheap. However, I would also recommend that you buy a spare one while you're at it because the bag doesn't seem very durable.I have washed two loads of delicates in this bag and it has worked perfectly but is starting to have lots a loose threads, a few of which have gotten annoyingly caught up in the zipper. With the bag unraveling itself at the rate it is, I don't expect the thing to last for very long.However, for a product that costs under five dollars and is made in China, this bag is exactly what I expected it to be."
4,good for tiny clothes,perfect size for all of the baby socks and hats and other tiny items to keep them from getting lost in the washer/dryer.
1,not satisfied with these mesh bags,"would not purchase again, zipper tangles with mesh which remains stiff after many washings, not pleasant to use - i far prefer other bags i have gotten in the past."
1,Fell apart,I used this to wash and dry my bras and both bags fell apart. The holes are too big and the snaps on my bras got caught on them.
1,Didn't even last through 6 washings,"Not even used half a dozen times, and the side ripped out of one of the bags. I would spend more money and get a better quality product."
1,Not worth it,I was very disappointed when I received and opened this item. It was not as pictured on the web sight or the package that it arrived in. Even though I have not used this product yet I am sure it will not last very long because the construction and material are of very poor quaility. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5,Nifty Lingerie Bag,This Lingerie bag was just what I needed for washing all those delicate things that get stretched out/ or ruined in the washer. It's been great!
5,Mesh lingerie bags,Essential part of laundry day. These are large enough to put a small shirt in or several pairs of tights.
4,Mesh Bags,This was a good price for a very well made product.. they hold up well in the wash and have served there purpose saving my dress shirts from snagging and twisting up with other things in the wash... I will order from them again
2,Good value,"Inexpensive laundry bag. The only complaint I have is that the mesh holes are big and if you don't snap bra straps, the hooks will still snag other clothes in your load of laundry."
2,Falls apart,This bag started to fall apart -- strings coming out/apart -- within a few washes. I wish I'd sprung for a better quality one.
2,Doesn't hold up well,I bought this to put the babies socks in before going in the wash. It does its job but I've only used it a few times and it is already beginning to fray.
2,Will get the job done,It will do the job..Just make sure to use a safety pin because the zipper comes loose in the washer
5,Exactly what I was looking for,I bought three of these hard to find zippered lingerie bags and use them all the time. They are great.
5,Great deal so far,"Ok Let me say that I have only had the plasma for 3 days now and absolutly love it. The picture is great the computer looks great the price was great at 1999. Lots of inputs and comes with the stand and all the cords for every input. Xbox looks great on it my dvd player hooked up via rgb or composit looks perfect. I will keep updating this as time goes bye. But cant imagine anything better for the price. I am used to a 32"" sony trinitron so I know what a good picture looks like. Willl keep you informed. Ps And if there is humming I cant hear it and I dont usually watch tv with out the sound on. I dont use the tuner so I dont know how well that works."
4,Bang for the buck,"If you are looking for a low end plasma i.e 5k and below then this one is your best bet. There is no reason to spend 3500 for a panasonic or 5g's for a sony because the quality of this screen is top notch and the low price makes it that much better. I do agree with one of the other reviewers in that the screen is uncharacteristically heavy, something to take into consideration if you want to wall mount this unit. Other than that there are only two drawbacks and the reason for the 4 not 5 star rating is that its EDTV and no DVI input."
2,DON'T BUY IT,"HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE I BOUGHT IT.PICTURE IS NOT GOOD. MY IO YEAR OLD SONY TV HAS A BETTER PICTURE.MAKES A CLICKING NOISE EVERYTIME YOU CHANGE THE CHANNEL. RETURN IT FOR A NEW ONE, GOT THE SAME NOISE, GIVES YOU VERY LITTLE INFO ON SETTING IT UP. AND IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT ON YOUR WALL, YOU MUST BUY TWO BRACKETS THAT COST 150.00 EACH.ALSO THE REMOTE HAS ITS ON MIND. YOU HIT THE PICTURE BUTTON YOU'LL GET THE SLEEP TIMER."
2,2.5 years old and dead in the water,"When I bought this TV from BJ's,I paid $2,400 (after $100 refund as the TV's price dropped a week after I got it) in January of 2004. It hasn't given me any trouble except that the remote control never really worked well with it. It always took alot to get the signal into the sensor. Anyway, a few days ago it began making a double clicking noise when I turned it on. Yesterday it just clicked and was dead. After 3 dozen times or so, it finally came on but today when I went to turn it on, the set was completely dead. So, when it worked, it's great, but for that amount of money, I feel it should be lasting alot more then 2.5 years. I have been in the Technical end of the electronics business for 20 years and this leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
5,A Must Have Book! It is fantastic,"Stay Alive All Of Your Life is absolutely a must have book. It gives guidelines on how to enjoy each moment of every day . It is written in simple english so that it is easy to understand. It lets us know that life can be fun and exciting, no matter what the world problems are. A wonderful book!!"
5,Stay Alive All Your Life,This is a wonderful book and has helped me tremendously already and I'm only in chapter 2! It is upbeat and very helpful.
2,antiquated software,"This is the 2005 version of garden composer, and it shows its age. Very clunky, difficult to use. The encyclopedia of plants soundsd like a plus, but again, very clunky - you can sort but you can't search for a specific plant. I would not recommend this software."
2,Wrong color,"The pagoda is sturdy and the Budda carving is very precise and detailed, but mine has a red top and is poorly re-painted red. It looks like it was once painted gold but for some reason painted over with red paint. There's one red brush stroke per Budda so, you can see the gold paint on either sides. Overall, worth the five dollars."
1,Format Not for the USA,The PAL format does not work in the USA DVD Players it is for Europe only. The USA requirement is NTSC. Please confirm with your clients when purchasing which format is required .
5,Excellent book,The book arrived promptly and was in excellent condition. I would highly recommend this to others.
4,Forever a Fan,"Odd is certainly lovable and unpretentious with a pragmatic philisophical view of life and death who is also endowed with a keen sense of humor. He can see dead people and does not always know why they are there. He wants to help a close friend who has been kidnapped and whose father has been murdered. Along the path of his pursuit he visits one of his friends, P. Oswald Boone who has a cat named Terrible Chester. The description of the interaction between he and Terrible Chester and the dialogue exchanged between he and his friend is witty and entertaining. Forever Odd is thrilling and suspenseful as one wonders if he can save his friend and himself from the evil souls of the physical world and the violent anger of the spirit world."
4,Pleasant read,"It was a good story, both uplifting and pleasant to read. Although I wouldn't say it was my favorite Koontz book, I would recomend it to any of his fans."
3,Always fun to spend time with Odd,"As others have said, this one was't quite as good as the first, but it is still enjoyable spending time with Odd, his ghosts, and his friends.I think the weakness in this book is all the time in the tunnels. Odd is at his best interacting with ghosts and people. In this book too much time was spent just discribing the scenery. But it is still a good read!"
2,OK,"Sequel to Odd Thomas a novel that hit the spot in reader and made them beg for more. However the parasites of the literary world dissected and analyzed this work of art and came up with what they thought made the book a success. Dean might have followed this blind lead and gave us more of the same but without the spirit. I wish I had not read Forever, in an odd way it tainted Thomas' memory. The story is OK the writing is up to the high standard Dean sets and leads in but ichabod."
2,"Forever, its odd","When i first saw that there was a sequel to Odd thomas, i could not wait to read it, but after I got it, i wasnt too happy. The story is a little thin, given that the WHOLE BOOK is just one day. there was a lot of filler in the pages that would just delay to get to the action. that I found kind of irritating. Of course I missed Stormy, and i hate that Dean saw the need to kill her in the first book, this ""hero"" should be given a chance to be happy.but anyway, everybody knows that sequels are always risky, and not always the best, unless of course you are thinking of Terminator 2. Since he left the Door open for a third instalment of Odd, lets hope its a little better"
2,Two things...,"Two things: The end of the duel between Odd and the main villain is absolutely ridiculous. I was actually angry that it was so bad.ANDThe climax had occurred, and Odd is sitting down having a couple of beers, talking with everyone, like time doesn't exist. Wait...my supposed great friend is still locked in an elevator--ah, who cares, I'm having a beer. Ridiculous."
3,I agree with most readers here,"As I said in my review of the first book 'Odd Thomas' I loved the book and was greatly looking forward to reading the second book 'Forever Odd'. I started it immediately after finishing the first book and was pulled right back in to the life of Odd. Then it all went down hill.....the character Datura could have been a great villain, but she wasn't. Parts were so confusing I don't even know what was going on, where did that mountain lion come from? Why did Robert not attack Odd? And that chase scene with Andre was right out of a corny thriller movie. It left me not wanting to go out and get 'brother odd' the next book in the now 5 book series. Maybe I'll just leave them on my wishlist and maybe I'll get them in December but I'm not seeking Odd out at this time.The first book left you wanting more Odd, wanting a movie of Odd. This one left me struggling to finish it. I almost gave up but stayed with it. This is the first time Koontz has really let me down."
3,"Not as good as the first, but not bad!","I enjoyed this book however it was no where near as exciting to read as the first book in the series. I had some expectations on how the 2nd book was going to build off of the 1st books plot but that really didn't happen as i thought it would.With that said, i still enjoyed the read and i am still excited about reading the full series of Odd books. This book picks up the plot very quickly with one of the dead contacting Odd within the first few pages. The story sticks with the same plot the entire book and does not deviate at all. Odd is a tremendous character and i love the way Koontz tells his story.I am still hoping the books will develop into something more than just another tale of Odd's adventures but i also wonder if i should let go of my hopeful expectations for this charater. We shall see.Worth reading just dont set your expectations too high."
4,Last best of the series,"I feel that is is the last best of the series. I really appreciate Odd moving on and meeting new characters in the later novels, but this particular book had a great mix of both your fravorite characters and some new ones."
3,forever odd,not his best odd thomas book does not meet up to his other odd books which i like very much this one did not have the plot or interesting characters of the others
2,Just ok,The next chapter in the ODD THOMAS series is a little disappointing. It lacked the same heart that the first book offers. I felt somewhat bored reading the 75% of the book devoted to the walking around trying to find the young man. I often carved for something else. A plot twist or anything. It just stayed steady and predictable.
5,I Must be Odd,"I must be the odd one out; but, I loved this book. Forever Odd was fun to read; that's my barometer of a good book. Forever Odd was nonstop suspense in the most interesting settings: the underground waterway, the old hotel, the crawl spaces under the building. I could picture Odd in all of these scenarios and I liked seeing how he planned to escape from each dangerous predicament he encountered. The villains were more believable to me than that in Brother Odd. We can all relate on some level to the selfishness and materialism that is Datura.Maybe most readers want a book with more dialogue, more philosophy, more long, drawn-out boring conversations. Forever Odd is not the book for these people. This book is for someone who wants fun escapist fiction in which Odd faces perilous situations and uses his wits to come out on top. While not as epic as Odd Thomas, this was a worthy addition to the series."
2,Disappointed,"First of, I loved ""Odd Thomas"", and Odd was set up as a very interesting character.As soon as I knew Forever Odd was coming out, I got really excited, asking my local bookshop when it would arrive.I started reading it and quickly got very disappointed.There are some nice scenes, and it was great to catch up with some of the characters from ""Odd Thomas"", but there was soo much padding in this book.I kept thinking, ok interesting initial idea, but what is the story really going to be about, then 2/3 of the way through the book I was thinking, ""is this it?"".I expected so much more, its like getting a supreme pizza, opening the box and finding that while it is the same size as the previous pizza your ordered, its practically all dough and they pretty much forgot the toppings.Dean, you have to better."
2,Forever Odd,"This book fell horribly short of the first (Odd Thomas). Koontz is a great writer but in this sequal he was (IMO) looking to capitalize on the success of the first and dumped this one on the fans. His first book kept me captured and I couldn't wait to finish it.. this one was predictable and made me NOT want to finish it. The lack of any real hook for the readers, the lack of any investment (on Koontz part) in the secondary characters just proves that his heart was not in this book.Don't buy this book ...unless you can pick it up at a garage sale for 50 cents."
4,ya lotta love Odd Thomas,"Odd finds himself in another adventure. This time he has a friend that is kidnapped by some strange people. He discovers that his friend is being held in a burnt out old casino.The villian, Datura is very strange and wants Odd to show her the dead.Odd of course cannot show her and she is pissed. The book goes on to a rescue of Danny and Odd getting away in a series of tunnels.this one was not as well written as the first.But i love Odd Thomas."
2,"Tedious, silly, and sappy","I enjoyed Odd Thomas, the first novel in what is becoming a franchise for the author. I consider it one of Koontz's better efforts, but Forever Odd is no Odd Thomas. It's a tedious, sometimes painful read.The biggest let down in Forever Odd is the cartoon-like villain. She's annoying, not the least bit interesting, and more pathetic than she is menacing.The plot itself is thin. Koontz stretches things out, giving us more detail than we need about the tunnel system beneath Pico Mondo and loading his sentences with as many adverbs and adjectives as he can. Odd himself was endearing in the first novel but in Forever Odd his musings get too preachy for my taste. The life affirming ending was meant to be poignant but I found it sappy.And was Koontz serious when he killed his villain by random cougar attack? A cougar? Really Dean? That's the best you could come up with?Sometimes Koontz hits, sometimes he misses. Forever Odd is a miss."
3,Odd Thomas is slowing down,"Seems like the pace of the Odd Thomas series is slowing down a bit. Odd is quite a likeable character and the original novel, Odd Thomas, is quite recommendable if you haven't yet read it. This sequel, however, seems to drag on in places and is somewhat less compelling and enthralling than its predecessor.All in all, the novel (or the audiobook) is sufficiently entertaining to warrant the price tag. It's readable in a day or listenable in a nice long meandering weekend drive. Just don't expect the book to knock your socks off with new twists in Odd's life or with some of the gripping thriller genre material that Koontz was known for in his earlier years."
1,A sad and pathetic attempt by a once great author,"Ever since Dean Koontz jumped on the religious kook train, his writing has sadly, gone downhill. No longer do his books attempt to thrill and amaze the reader but instead are obvious and blatant attempts to hammer his particular view of the world and his religious convictions home. He has stopped writing mystery and started writing proselytizing propoganda. Gone are the thrills that shone in Lightning, Watchers, etc. I used to enjoy his books but I find I can't abide his preaching. This was the absolute last book of his I will ever bother to try suffering through."
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,I normally like a Dean Koontz book for a literary roll in the hay. They usually leave me thrilled and/or amused. FOREVER ODD made me wonder why I had invested the time when I could've romped around with Stephen King.
5,Read Odd Thomas First,"I am seven chapters in and I love it. Although the reviewers say you don't have to, I would read ODD THOMAS first. You'll enjoy that book tremendously and this one will make sense faster. You'll appreciate Odd much more. You will want to read the other one anyway if you finish this one first. You'll want more of this incredible character, so why meet him as we did and enjoy him from the beginning. You won't regret it.*******I must stop getting excited and entering reviews before I finish the book. I was SO desperate for more Odd Thomas. This started out interesting, but sagged about 1/3 of the way and I just tossed it. Fortunately, Brother Odd is MUCH better. If you are a die-hard fan, you may enjoy this, but be warned."
1,BORING,The first half ropes you in...the second half is boring to the point that I had to skim through it. Don't waste your time.
2,Disappointing overall..,"I usually have a keen interest in books by Dean. However, this was an excellent character placed into an ok book. I didn't read the first one, this happened to be at the airport. The beginning was excellent but fell flat on it's face. The ending was too abrupt also. I was expecting to see some more action, but we went from sewer to cafe in a page."
3,not impressed,I was so looking forward to more of Odd Thomas but this book just didn't live up to the first:(
2,Mr. Koontz....what happened?,"I have been reading Dean Koontz for many years now. I believe I've been through his entire library...and read some of his books multiple times. Odd Thomas is one of my favorite Koontz stories. Forever Odd seemed to me to be a lost chapter, or maybe a quick attempt to keep the character alive in his readers minds. I read the book in a day and didn't want for more. This book should have been offered in paperback as it hit the stands as it didn't seem worth the coverprice. I love Odd Thomas but this installment was dissapointing at best."
4,Better than the original,"With the main characters already being established and described in the original novel of the series, not much rhetoric is needed to get to the heart of the story.Odd Thomas is just as likeable as he is in the original novel, and considering his friend's plight in life and his general demeanor, he proves to be just as amiable. Odd's friend is Danny Jessup, who suffers from a condition that makes him very sympathetic to the reader.The villians in this novel prove to be even creepier than in the original, and help the story move along at a nice pace.Sometimes Koontz novels can be bogged down by pointless composition by the author that just seems to add nothing to the book but the word count. However, Koontz does a great job of not straying too far from the center stoyline, and sets up an intriguing storyline for the next novel in the series."
3,Not my favorite Koontz,"I didn't like this story as much as Odd Thomas. It just seemed like a ""what's the point?"" type of story. Do we really need to send Odd on this ""ODD"" adventure? I don't believe so. It didn't seem to build him up in any way. It didn't seem to change his personality or give him any great insight to the world. It didn't really seem to serve much of a purpose except to bridge between Odd Thomas and Brother Odd -- both decent books.Either way I'm a fan of Koontz and I enjoyed this journey through his ""ODD"" imagination. Don't read BROTHER ODD without reading this one. You could, but I wouldn't."
3,Forever Odd,This is a decent read. Not as good as the first or the third in this series. I bought it used and felt I paid a fair price for it.
3,not as good,"I loved loved loved Odd Tomas, so I was so happy to find the next chapter, sadly it is not as good. Over all its one of Koontz darker story plots and it is filled with intresting twists, it just lacks the impact that Odd Tomas had. Even though I think its an okay book I still think it is wroth the read, so you should buy it, or get it from the libary it reads pretty quick."
3,Good Follow Up,"Not as good as the first in the series, but Forever Odd continues to breathe life into the interesting protagonist, Odd Thomas. Koontz delivers a fast paced tale, but in the end leaves you a bit unfulfilled. The climax didn't hit on all the cylinders for me and I was expecting a bit more supernatural elements. In the end, I enjoyed the book."
2,Not worth your time,This book is not worth your time. I kept waiting for the book to draw me in and it was the exact opposite. I could barely finish it.
3,Shows much promise.,"Although not as good a read as the first of the series, ""Forever Odd"" is solid entertainment. This time around Mr. Koontz is somewhat more verbose, however, I enjoyed this the 2nd installment of the series, and anticipate reading the next book. I find ""Oddie"" a likable character, as I do all the other characters he relates to. This story has a little more violence than the first, but again, I found myself pleased by the plot twists, the humor, and sincerity. A solid 3 stars."
4,Odd's life not as gripping as before,"I liked the book. I enjoyed walking in this foot steps. Developing a connection with characters he meets. However, you never really get to know the villians, never really understand what is going on. You got a lot of running around, near misses and unexplainable thrills you come to expect from Dean and Odd. But, like many of the endings. It just doesn't deliver. It was rushed, weak and quite sad (not the good kind)."
2,I Agree With Terry Mesnard,"Dean Koontz is my favorite author. I'll buy every book he ever writes. I loved Odd Thomas, and it may be my favorite Koontz book to date.But for most of the reasons outlined in Terry Mesnard's review, there is none of the magic in this sequel.But I will say this: Koontz at 20% is like most other authors at 80%. I would read his shopping lists. I've preordered the next in the Odd Thomas series, ""Brother Thomas."" I am hoping for a return of the magic."
4,Odd... And Proud of It!,"I thought that over all this was a decent book. I enjoyed Odd's narration just as much as in the first novel. I thought that the book however was somewhat weighed down by the story. It was believable, but what happened to all the ghostly aspects of the first one. I found myself comparing this more to Velocity (The only other Koontz book I've read so far besides Odd Thomas) Than to the previous novel. Even though it isn't as good as the first book, I would still recommend this novel, just because Odd is such a great character. *Little Spoiler* The real highpoint of this book was for me the reflection that Odd has at the end on the real horrors of the world, how we have really messed up our opportunity here. Its broken and can't be fixed.But again, read this book if you enjoyed the first one, its still good by any standards. It just isn't as brilliant as the first one."
4,Odd Fan,"Datura was definately a Koontz villan. Evil, intelligent and formidable. A lot of readers don't like how Koontz gets so descriptive. I'm one who really appreciates the fact that he can bring you into the action with his details and keep you on the edge of your seat. Great read and a nice second adventure for Odd Thomas."
5,Can Odd continue?,"I am not going to do a rendition, this has already been done quite well. This book was just as good as the first one, Odd Thomas. I think Dean Koontz really shines in this fascinating series about an honest good-guy who just happens to see dead people. You would think having Elvis for a part of his dead forte would get corny and cheezy but I think you would be amazed how Dean Koontz avoids the cheeze. I highly recommend this book. But you have to read these in order, I do not believe they would be as compelling if you tried to read each as a standalone novel."
4,"Not as Odd as the first Thomas, but oddly enough...","Odd Thomas is just as endearing a character in Forever Odd as he was in the original, and the supporting cast is still there (though unfortunately, not as prominent as in the first novel). Unlike other reviewers, I found the villains in Odd Part II to be unnerving and frightening.If there is one negative, it is that Koontz spends a bit too much time laboring over the details of tunnels, fences and floors. But given the suspense that he creates and sustains, this flaw is forgivable.Koontz fans know that he loves to use metaphors. If there is one thing he does better in this sequel, it is his use of sometimes hilarious, but always appropriate metaphors.If you are a fan of Koontz and Odd, you will enjoy this book. It left me ready for Part III."
2,Not a very good plot.,This book is not nearly as good as Odd Thomas or any of Koontz's other books. I am a big Dean Koontz fan and was disappointed with this book. It was very slow moving and did not have much of a plot.
2,Disappointing. Not a Koontz Classic,"Remember when Koontz stories were great? You couldn't put them down. You couldn't imagine how anyone would survive or what would explain the supernatural power of whatever entity the good guys were battling. Cherish the memories. FOREVER ODD is nothing like that.Odd Thomas lacks the suspense and supernatural mystery of classic Koontz stories. We still have a few brutal murders, insane villains, horror-movie nightmare scenes and one very introspective hero. (Even Odd Thomas is less interesting here than in his first novel.) There are a few good spots but FOREVER ODD is not nearly as good as the early Dean Koontz books. It's too bad because I enjoyed Pico Mundo, the ghost of Elvis, Odd and the rest of the cast in Odd Thomas. If any of them make it into a third novel, let's hope it's one with more deserving plot."
3,Marginally Interesting,"I am a huge fan of the novel Odd Thomas; it is a creative, hook-worthy read. However, Forever Odd lacks many elements that grabbed me in the first novel. There are no bodachs, no real compelling mystery, and characters either fall out of the air or fall flat -- where was Danny Jessup in the first novel? Forever Odd is seemingly aimless until we meet Dethura (around page 200). Once she enters, the novel becomes more interesting only to be fizzled out within sixty or so pages. The labyrinthine elements employed just did not work for this story or Odd's character. Even though the inherent humor and philosophy of Odd is always a nice touch, I found myself skimming through parts of this, and skimming is never something I aim to do in an engrossing read."
2,Something that for once didn't live up to the hype. (Sadly!),"I am disappointed in this book. The situations in which Odd always feels he needs to do it alone have grown tiresome. The main evil character was not as formidable as many of Dean Koontz characters in the past and I just found her to be a bland form of a villian. The book just didn't have a substancial plot line from which I am used to seeing as well. I waited quite a while to read this book and read it in two days, not because I couldn't put it down, but because it was a quick, easy read. I would recomend it if you like Odd Thomas the character, then you will enjoy the book, but don't expect anything of substance to happen."
4,Intriguing,I enjoyed the way the author kept it intriguing. It made it hard for me to put the book down. I look forward to the third book about Odd.
2,Short story sized adventure padded out with ramble,"Forever Odd starts with promise - Odd's friend disappears after a brutal murder, Mr Thomas gets tazered by a snake-eyed man, and conspiracy to take advantage of Odd's odd powers is revealed.Unfortunately the story slumps due to lack of plot. If someone took one of those 'how to write books' and plotted out the key events I can't image there being more than 4. Now I don't mind my novels straighforwards and even don't mind short. But I do mind plotless wonders than %50 of the material is the main character mincing around thinking about things.That coupled with a couple of unexplained duex ex machina type events towards the conclusion (or I admit possibly by the end of the book my attention wavered due to disinterest) leaves Forever Odd low down on my star rating."
1,Is it just the money you are after ???,"What a wonderful book ODD THOMAS was! What a total disappointment FOREVER ODD is. What happened Dean? Did you have to meet a quick deadline or something and just couldn't come up with an idea?If you really liked ODD THOMAS don't destroy your respect for it by reading FOREVER ODD. It is really just a junked up piece up literature to keep the ODD thing going on.I love so many of Dean's books, but you can always tell when he is just trying to throw a piece of trash out there to meet a deadline. This is one of them. Save your money. Don'y buy it. Go get your original ODD THOMAS book and read it again for free.Sheesh Dean .... help us fans out a little here buddy !!Densel MyersYukon, Oklahoma"
2,A Sad Disappoint,I had hoped for great things from this novel and for a bit it looked like I would get them. However this just was not a very well written novel. For reasons as to why check the discussion below.
5,"Odd, yet Excellent","Odd Thomas, (the charcter introduced in Koontz's 2001 novel of the same name) is back and still communicating with the restless dead while grieving for his lost soul-mate, Stormy Llewellyn. One year later after the first novel finds him still trying to recover when he is thrown into yet another struggle.Dr. Wilbur Jessup has been violently murdered, but that isn't Odd's only concern. Jessup is the father of his best friend, Danny, who suffers from a medical condition which leaves him terribly vulnerable, is missing. The worst is feared, but Odd knows that Danny is still alive. Using his unique gifts; he sets out to find him before it's too late, not knowing what he will find when he gets there.Once again, Dean Koontz has written a brilliant hero whom which we all cheer for along his struggles."
2,A LET-DOWN,"I read Dean Koontz' novels voraciously. I'm sorry to say this was a big let down for me. ""Odd Thomas"" was a wonder to behold, this is a failure."
2,Needs To Be Edited,Odd Thomas's encounters with the dead are the best part of this novel. The rest of the story drags.Odd Thomas's friend is kidnapped by by an evil woman whose price is that Odd Thomas shows her dead people. This villian talks alot about strange things which the reader learns what they mean at the end of the story.There is a chase that goes on forever. The chase part needs editing.I listened to the audio and the narrator was very good.
2,Forever Odd it shall remain.,"After being disappointed by the first book, I thought the second one would shine some hope.However, I ended up meeting the same results with the last book.This time I read it completely through though. It was painful.If you didn't like the first book, I would not invest in this one."
3,2nd odd Thomas bok,Not as good as the first...but a good read. I will probably read the next one in hopes it will be as good as the first....
3,SO SO,"IT was a good read. I think it was a let down follow Odd Thomas. Look Forward to the Brother ODD, must reviews Koontz gets back to the Odd Thomas and the writing style in book 1"
2,"Man, that was a hard slog","I was given this book as a gift and managed to work my way through it because and only because it was the only thing in the house I had not read. It was a real page turner, as in ""Hurry up and turn the page in the hope that it gets better.""I read another book in the series (Brother Odd) which was given to me later and found it much more enjoyable, though honestly I almost didn't even crack the cover based on expectations arising from reading Forever Odd.Forever Odd is in my opinion a forever waste of time. Two stars."
2,"Not As Good As The First, But Good None The Less","When I first tried to read this novel a year ago, I thought, ""What a disappointment"". I was expecting the same page turning excitement, the same wonderful characters that we grew to love, the same...Odd as the original. But, instead, it just seemed like there was something missing. I put it down half way through. I couldn't take it anymore.I picked it back up recently and started over with a fresh, open mind. It wasn't long before the story grabbed me and I found myself in Odd's psychic magnetism again.I gave it 2 stars because I had already rated it last year and I could not change it. If I could, I would up it to 4 stars. I suppose if I had not read the first book right before this one when I first tried it, I may have at least finished this one to see what happened the first time.This is sort of like when they ruin a good movie with a lousy sequel. I look forward to reading ""Brother Odd"", his next adventure."
3,This is the one to skip,"I love Odd Thomas! I love the series. But this one went over the edge. Not like any of them are true, but they have an authentic ring to them. This one gets silly and loses the character and feel of the others. So read the series, but skip this one. You won't miss anything."
4,Enjoyable Read,"This isn't as good as his 1st Odd Thomas novel, but Odd is just as lovable as he is in the original novel. I think since I loved the 1st book my expectations were to high, thus leaving me disappointed.My main problem w/ this bk. had to do w/ the villainess, Datura. I found her annoying & stupid when she constantly responded w/ ""liar."" She sounded like a little spoiled brat. I would have preferred her to be more of an intelligent sex vixen - more like Eve in ""Dark Rivers of the Heart."" Instead Datura sounded like a stupid bimbo & bored me to tears.The other problem I have w/ this bk. is that Odd is supposed to be best friends w/ this guy named Danny. To me this character came from nowhere.That said, I still found the bk. entertaining from beginning to end & I could not put it down.This book should not be read before the 1st novel ""Odd Thomas"" since it spoils the endings of the first book."
3,Not as good as Odd Thomas,This book is average at best. It was a disapointment compared to Odd Thomas. Seemed like he was cashing in on the success of the first one.
3,Not as good as the first one.,"This is a much simpler story. The original characters are there,but you feel the Author's angst to get the sequel completed more than the peril of the characters. The first book ""Odd Thomas"" is required reading before ""Forever Odd""."
5,Big Fan of Odd!,Koontz is one of my all-time favorite writers and Odd Thomas is one of his best characters. I can't wait to read the third installment!! Koontz always delivers characters that I want to get to know better. I'm always disappointed when the book ends and I won't get to find out what happens to them next! That's why I'm so thrilled that he's given us three Odd books!
2,Get to the point already ...,"Loved Odd Thomas, so I couldn't wait for this. One word: BORING. Koontz mentions how his villainess drones on and on and on ... so does he. Lots of words; little reason for them. Nothing happens over and over again. The last few chapters had me groaning to get through them."
2,not so good,"The first ODD book was good. This one, not good. The writing was sloppy. I felt that most of the book was a description of the old hotel and of the underground tunnels. I hope the next book is a good one.Mr. Koontz... not so good on this one. But I still like you :)"
3,Still waiting for the real sequel,"I'd been waiting eagerly for the sequel to Odd Thomas, and I devoured Forever Odd as quickly as I could. Odd Thomas was a tough act to follow, and unfortunately I don't think Forever is quite worthy.The story is entertaining enough; by itself it would make a pretty typical Koontz thriller. I half suspect that that's what happened: Koontz adapted an already-concieved villain and setting for a successful hero. (Okay, I'm being more cynical than I should.) But it's more of a rushed-Hollywood-style sequel than a good book sequel. It was fun to see the people again, but I still fell like I'm waiting for the real followup novel.If you enjoyed Odd Thomas, by all means read Forever. It's a suspenseful thriller, and it is fascinating to see how the very believable residents of Pico Mundo, including Odd, have been carrying on. If you haven't read Thomas, try that on for size first."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING SEQUEL..............!!,"After discovering the lovable psychic boy Odd in Koontz's prequel, Odd Thomas, I was ecstatic to find that there was a sequel on the horizon. My excitement was shortlived. Not long into this book I realized that my reunion with Odd would hold none of the excitement and originality as encountered it its predecessor. Quite literally, 50% of this novel describes Odd's journey to find/save his childhood friend. 50% of nothing but descriptions of scenery, underground topography, and casino ruins. When the action finally begins, readers are still left wondering,""Huh?"" One simply cannot deny this author's command of the English language, but it could be suggested that he revels in it...resulting in long, belabored thoughts and sentences by Odd that seem ridiculously inappropriate in times of crisis.Clearly, there will be another tale in this series. One can only hope that this author is more kind to both Odd and his readers in the next installment.DYB"
1,Short story disguised as a novel,"Awful. I am a koontz fan, and I liked Odd Thomas. However, this book is 10 page short story disguised as a novel. This is a case of a talented author churning out crap to make a buck."
3,"Good video, but not right for me","This is a very well-produced, professional exercise video based on ballet moves, but it just didn't do much for me. I think that after all the aerobics and step aerobics I've done, I just couldn't retrain myself to learn dance steps, despite the excellent instruction. I felt that the toning moves were challenging and effective, but couldn't get a good cardio workout from the ballet."
2,Some good idea's,"This is a book that i will keep but i do not believe i'll ever put it to much use.It has very good picture's,and some very,very nice cakes.I was hoping it would show alot of royal icing flower's,it only show's 7.The 7 that it does show the picture's are very small & there isnt much detail on how to make them.I was also hoping for several royal icing figure's.Not much of those either,just 3.They also use royal icing to completely ice the cake in,yuck! Royal icing dries rock hard & does not taste very well,even with extract added.It does have some nice templates in the back that you could use for anything.It has Alphabet templates,in 2 different styles,a sleigh,sailboat, and some scrolls.If your looking for a book on making some really cute figure's for cakes,then look up Roland Winbeckler's book's.If its more detail on flower's & all kinds of decoating,then nothing beats a Wilton catalog & thier video's."
4,Good strategy game,I like this game. Played it 4 times already and still cannot figure out what is the best winning strategy. The choices for each next move are enormous - almost like in Chess.
5,Sobering Title - Good Info,"Percy is right on in this book - all before the modern health clubs took off. He walks the walk. It would be great if it could come back out for general circulation. Percy was the trainer of, I believe, Herb Elliott who held the world's 1500 meter record during the 50's - 60's, and this is a great guide one's maintaining a healthy body, mind, and spirit as one ages - running, general exercises, weight training, and diet. Percy himself was a living example of the common sensical advice, routines, and admonitions - strongly given as the title indicates - contained in the book. Percy is described as irascible and a health food nut. Google Herb Elliott to learn more. As an athletic trainer, the word ""fail"" was unknown to Percy."
3,"Not his best, but has its moments","I saw this at the old Jefferson Square Theater in Columbia, SC when I was in college in 1983. Pryor's last concert film, and not one of his better ones. Some interesting moments though. Mudbone appears in one of his rare filmed skits (compare this with the ""Richard Pryor Show"" DVD which repeats the classic Mudbone performance from ""Is It Something I Said""). There is a really interesting moment when Pryor talks to a fiddler crab that crawls on his stool that is the kind of one-man theater that distiguished Pryor from his cursing copycats who had all of the profanity but none of the profundity of the master. He also does a frightfully accurate rendition of a junkie going on a nod. You can tell that he knows what he's talking about. In either case, this is for fans only. Rest in Peace brother Pryor."
2,Not good,This dvd is NOT the one to pick if you are looking for some great laughs! Sober Richard Pryor is sadly not funny.
4,Small sizes,"The shoes are great! Really good-looking shoes. The reason I rate a 4 instead of a 5, is that the shoe sizes run a bit small."
5,What an awesome Cat,I've had these shoes for almost 2 years now and they're still just as comfortable as the day I bought them. I do try and stick to wearing them as a pure driving shoe though since they don't provide that much all-day walking comfort as a thicker souled sneaker.
1,Lots of money for an item that cracks!,Don't bother with this canister! The bottom cracks very shortly after using! Once it cracks it will not hold the vacuum seal. You're paying alot of money for a big piece of useless plastic.
1,"Only stores ""crack...s""","I agree with another reviewer. I cannot speak to the extent of their cracks...but ALL of my canisters have cracked on the bottom (some within a couple of weeks) and no longer hold a seal. I suppose still useable but not if you want an airtight, vacuum sealed container...the reason these containers are made and purchased. Cereal stays no fresher in these cracked containers than in the bag it comes in. No more for me!"
1,Food Saver Canisters,All of the canisters that I ordered after my purchase of a FOOD SAVER machine have developed mini fractures in the base of each canister and won't hold a vacuum.And are basically worthless for vacuum storage and they don't come with warranties.
5,"Eleven spaceships, four aliens, and a fifth grader compete","Eleven spaceships, four aliens, and a fifth grader compete in an intergalactic race from one side of the universe to the other but must face some formidable challenges during the race. When Spuckler finds his old rival is also in the running, Akiko finds herself in the competition for a trophy in Aiko & the Alpha Centauri 5000, a fun science fiction tale for young readers."
3,entertaining but predictable,Good play for teenagers. Likable original characters and good dialogue. It was entertaining but disappointing because of its predictability and much used sitcom plot.
4,This was a good book.,"This was a good book i think. I liked that she was so independent and could be so strong when she had to. i also liked the end of the book when everybody was cheering in the streets, and when Hallie asked what they were doing, they said, Armistice, War's over!!!! I would recommend this book."
1,It was great while it worked.,The cats loved it. But the pump stopped working six weeks after purchase. The box was recycled during the holidays so now I'm stuck with an expensive water bowl that I cannot return. Ouch.
2,Could be so much better,"In principle it is a great idea.The product appears huge on the model on the package, covering from the neck down to almost to the waist. The actual product is about 16"" long and only reaches the mid back if it is set at the neck level. There is no picture of the front so it is unclear how they intended you to wear this unit. If the straps are placed across the chest, it rides up too high. The straps are very short and therefore extremely uncomfortable to wear, I guess because they need to pull the unit tightly against the back in order to receive any benefit at all from the massagers. Some additional adjustment to the straps could make this a much better product."
3,not one of his best,political undertones are weak and inconsistent. Not like his usual stuff. Interesting plot though.
3,Not what I remembered it to be,I bought this perfume off a memory I had used it more than 25 years ago. The scent has changed and does not have that earthy almost sinful scent II remembered. Could the formula be changed. It's Pleasing enough but timid and has the scent of talcum central to its presentation. If you haven't smelled the original it's nice enough if you're familiar with it you might be disappointed. Service from the provider was flawless.
4,Fine Phantasy ; Good Quartets,"The gem on this CD is the Phantasy Quartet which shows the influence of both Brahms and Faure. Bridge's second string quartet shows the influence of Faure and, perhaps, Ravel. It is a delight. Is it a masterpiece as the notes claim? I doubt it, but it is very enjoyable. The fourth quartet is less appealing to this listener, but it's worth hearing and re-hearing. The Maggini Quartet plays with its usual excellence and the recording is beatifully clear."
4,My father in laws favorite book and he is a book worm,I have purchased several for my father in law whom is an avid reader and he has given them away as presents so it must be a good book. I am not reading it though...
4,travel to the Appalachians and back in time,"While reading this book I am immersed in another time and culture, yet it does not feel foreign to me. She was a very good writer and it is lovely to find this less well known work of hers."
3,Ok,"This case fits the camera only, no place to store lens hood, spare battery or accessories. Good for protecting the camera around the house, but not much good for travel beyond going to a relatives hose for a party. Really too large to wear on belt but no wrist or neck strap nor anywhere to attach one. It is well constructed. I use it to protect the camera but bought a larger case for travel."
3,Works,"Just needed to seal a hole in a humidifier tank. It's doing its job so far, now I'm just wondering if I'll need that again."
3,Not Walker's best,"This is an okay, but not great book, and certainly not Walker's best. It's a sad, slow story about a doctor's wife (Dr. Norton's wife) who is dying of MS (multiple sclerosis.) Because Dr. Norton's wife is for the most part bedridden, she has time - too much time - to think. Mrs. Norton becomes suspicious of her sister, who lives with Dr. Norton and his invalid wife, as well as her husband who is nothing but devoted to her.If you like sad, slow-moving books, read this. However, I think Walker's Winter Wheat and The Quarry are much, much better books than this one."
5,Love love love Mildred Walker,I discovered Mildred Walker after she had passed away. I've introduced her to all my readinga friends and my book club. No one regardless of age doesn't love her. It's a must for all women and rural women especially.
5,Very happy,"Very happy with this product. It is easy to use, and over time, it does work to diminish lines around the eyes."
3,"Important message, implementation advice of uncertain merit.","Although Dr. Phil is well intentioned, one is left with the impression that the book attempts to repackage ""standard"" psychological advice as original because of the popularity factor of Mr. McGraw.While reading the book one is torn between trusting Dr. Phil and and suppressing the agonizing fear of anticipated failure. It's really tempting to believe that Dr. Phil's repetition of what we heard and tried before will somehow work this time around.Dr. Phil is a tough character and the workability of his psychology is based mostly on the idea of will power. However, if will power alone was sufficient, we would not need Dr. Phil's help. We would quite successfully follow anyone's good general advice.Although the book does a good job of emphasizing the importance of family, we need to look elsewhere if real and lasting change is what we are looking for."
5,"GREAT BOOK, GOOD PRICE.",THANK YOU. You can't go wrong with advise from Dr. Phil McGraw. Be sure to check out the handy workbook.
5,HELP!!!!,"My family has problems. WE are always fighting. I got married to young, and thought my marriage would be a dreem. Bit is is a nightmare. The father of my children is in jail and Imraising them all alone. Dr. Phil help me please! Me and my mom watch him all the time and we're buying this book to help us cuase if no one else can, dr Phil sure can."
1,I am confused,"The title and premise of this book is to put Family First. Yet I just read an interview with Dr Phil in one of the major national woman's magazines. He says - very proudly - that in all the years of their marriage he has only spent a day or two with his wife's sister and her family because he prefers to stay home and let his wife visit on her own. He feels time with them is wasted and he put his foot down from the very start of their relationship that he would not visit them. So, that is putting family first??? How incredibly sad for his wife, her sister and all their children. The entire clan has suffered because of his attitude. And what a shame that he sells this attitude as good advice."
4,on the ball with dr phil,"i promised to God that i will do a good job as a parent. but all of us need a little help. God has brought us dr phil and i listen to his every word. he and oprah are a fantastic tag-team in the afternoons, and after his prime time special last night i think this is a guy who has a mission. i turned my family around this morning, starting with some heart to hearts over cereal. i told them how honored i am to be their mother and that they are the biggest blessings in my life. i apologized for not being there for them when they needed me, being too busy with housework and my charities. now i am buying the book. it will go on my night stand, and i willread it every night before bed, dreaming of my little angels and all the goodness i am going to give them from now on."
2,THE BOOK IS BORING,"Before, i purchased this book, i saw the rating is 4.5 stars, i thought the book would be a good one. However, after purchasing the book and read through it, i regret of purchasing this book. And the reason I regret of purchasing this book, because it's not as interest as i thought it would be. Doctor Phil writes too much of nonesense before he even tell you the step to correct the problems. But even when he shows the step to correct the problem, it's nothing interesting to learn neither. I almost given up reading this book many time. The book really is boring. I don't find it exciting as i would expected it.In addition, I like to purchase Dr. Phil book, because i liked his show. I thought the book should be as good as i watched the show. But it turned out opposite. I would not buy another book from Dr. Phil. I grade this book a C or lower, average or below average. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It's not worth the money."
5,excellent book for advice,This is a highly recommend book by Dr. Phil. Gives excellent adise on raising a great family.
4,good advice,"this is real advice for real parents with real problems. There are a lot of parenting books out there, but this book beats them hands down. it is practical useable advice for all parents. whether you have a family that is in need of serious help or you just feel that your family could be closer this is the book for you and yours."
3,Another resource with little merit,"I think poor Dr. Phil might be getting a bad rap here. Any book that helps someone even a little to prioritize and cherish tier family has merit..it just may not have credibility. If you are looking for a light read with some good ideas this book is worth a look. However, there are many credible, researched based books by real experts that would certainly be in front of the line. I recommend Dr. Michele Borba's books for anyone interested in real solutions to modern parenting problems. Otherwise, Dr. Phil is entertaining and Family First has the right idea, if not the best implementation."
5,Shipped Quickly and was packaged very nicely,This came quickly and it came as it was advertised; very impressed with how nicely wrapped it was- I would not hesitate to order again
4,Can't wiat to finish,"I've been anticipating the publication of Family First. I went out yesterday and bought it first thing. I've not had a chance to read the entire book, but one of the five factors caught my eye. Factor #2 talks about how every familly member is authentic. Dr. Phil uses a comparison between snearkers and children. He writes ""Your child's authentic self may have started out clean, solid and brand new, like the last pair of new sneakers you bought them."" This is a brilliant analogy! I've not finished reading this book, but from what I've read so far I give it two thumbs up!"
5,ABOUT TIME,"FINALLY, A BOOK THAT HELPS THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE FAMILY. MOST BOOKS TAKE CARE OF THE PERSON THAT BOUGHT THE BOOK. THIS IS FOCUSING ON THE COMPLETE ENTITY OF FAMILY. THIS BOOK IS NEEDED!"
4,Another delightful Cherryh concoction,"As a fan of C.J. Cherryl, I was delighted to stumble across her Merovingen Nights series and be once again drawn into a world of interesting characters and events. The setting of Merovingen with its canals and intricate bridgework becomes as interesting as the characters who live there. The action and political intrigue provide an interesting plot and the love of Jones for her beautiful aristocrat, well any girl knows all about that and can identify one gorgeous hunk in her life that made her heart beat faster. The book will not shake your world with new concepts, but it will provide a most satisfying escape read. I look forward to reading the rest of the series. For similar action adventure science fiction worlds seeCaught In Time (Alysian Universe Series)"
3,Pretty ball,"If you like the looks of the ball enough for the price, then get it! However, if you're wanting a ball to really play with, then this is not it."
3,ehh,although multicultural education is extremely important this textbook fashion of literature can be a little dry
2,Not suitable for modern classrooms,"James Banks, considered a master scholar in multicultural studies, came right out of the Civil Rights Movement. One would think that any strategy for teaching ethnic studies should be objective, but this is not the case. His writing is infused with bitterness carried from his personal experiences, and rather than discuss tolerance and appreciation, he preaches reverse-racism. He has a tendency to box people into groups according to their heritage: Mexican-American, Italian-American, etc. What if you do not identify with any group whatsoever and are the product of early 20th century alien assimilation? Those who cannot find a cultural niche are considered Anglo-Saxon. If you pay attention to his writing, you notice that being white is not a good thing. Multicultural studies should promote tolerance. This intolerant mode of thinking is outdated and needs serious revision."
3,Pretty in Pink,"Elated is how I felt when I received this bracelet as a gift. Disappointed is how I am with the fact that it's so small. By adding just 1/4 to 1/2 an inch more to this bracelet I could enjoy wearing it so much more. At 7"" it's too small to wear comfortably. I'm looking into trying to find a way to add length but haven't found one yet. As for the color and style, they are just what I would want in this type of bracelet...the only thing holding me back from giving it more stars is the size."
1,Waste of money,"The sound quality is very poor. It is like talking into a tin cup. Also, the sound quality of the answering machine is also very poor. Difficult to understand messages. Trying to tweak-otherwise will return."
5,Panasonic phone/answer machine,"This is a smaller unit than I thought from the picture shown, but because it is smaller than the usual unit (but not by much) it will fit anywhere unobtrusively. It works great and is well worth the price."
1,Worthless,The mixing blades are made out of the cheapest plastic imaginable and they broke simply assembling the unit. Do yourself a favor and throw your money on a fire instead.
2,don't don't .. don't believe the hype,"i loved Funeral, the day it came out, a friend bought it. wow Track One soared! Got the pleasure of seeing them in a small club in Milwaukee where they exploded off the stage; one just knew this was going to supernova.Bought tickets to see them in Chicago this May 2007, the 3 night stint old out immediately. so psyched to hear this album! prolonged the ecstasy by waiting a week before purchasing, then .. what a yawnfest, in a word .. dour. I struggled hard to find a track i could connect to, even 'living in an age where darkness is called light' or whatever, oh boy ... poorly designed superfluous packaging which does nothing to enhance the experience. feck this stuff, i'm turning in my alt card, i'll be content on waiting until all this crap dies and composts into new death metal. sold my tickets.save yr money. i gave it two stars for the melody in track 4, and the fact i can't make an album like this myself."
1,Terrible,I can't wait until this current trend of music gives way to something else. It's boring and dreary. Next...
1,Self-indulging garbage.,"If you liked the uniqueness and energy present and welcome in their first CD ""Funeral"", then you are in for a surprise. This has to be the most boring, repetitive, mirthless, disappointing piece of garbage I have ever heard. While some tracks sound like they are being performed from the bottom of a well (or maybe from a hole directly connected to the underworld, I am not sure), other tracks sound like the instruments are being played by trained performing monkeys, who only know three chords. The subject matter is never funny, never fun, never smart; it is dull and depressing and basically trying too hard to be different, from the very beginning up to the very end. Reselling on Ebay? You betcha."
1,I Don't Get the Hype,"Worst and most useless use of the hurdy gurdy ever. I love bands that use cool instruments like Dead Can Dance, Loreena McKennitt (both pretty ambient) and Neutral Milk Hotel (more modern, ecclectic). This band seems like they just throw in a bunch of instruments to try and be unique and hip. I agree with the reviewers that think this is a droning rip off of much better bands. I can see the references to Joy Division, maybe Echo and the Bunnymen in the inflection/strain of the singers voice. I'm not a big fan of Modest Mouse or the other pack of whiney bands, although I do like White Stripes and Franz Ferdinand."
1,Sorry! Still Sucks!,"Since I posted my review of Arcade Fire's recent aural lobotomy, I've had a number of comments from all kinds of thoughtful and concerned Amazon readers. I would like to say how grateful I am for all of your amusing and ultimately sycophantic comments. It seems I struck a nerve with some whose intellect I obviously insulted. I'm so very sorry that I hurt your little indie feelings and wish to extend this: THIS ALBUM SUCKS A__! Not only is boring upon first listen, it actually gets worse the more I hear it. If there is anything good on this album, they must have left it in the studio. Thanks very much, but I'll stick with Metric, The Dears, The Stars, Tokyo Police Club, etc. when it comes to Canadian content. And for real subtlety and lyrical expression, I'll take The Good, The Bad & The Queen. I wonder if Arcade Fire has heard that one? Could learn a few things!Bring on the comments!!!"
4,Great....until the bottom falls out.,"I was fully prepared to give this album 5 stars. I really was. I really liked the variety - the foot-stomping rhythm of ""Keep The Car Running"", the sad & haunting ""Ocean Of Noise"", the way ""Bad Vibrations/Black Wave"" and ""The Well & The Lighthouse"" each shift gears midway through. I definitely liked where the album was going. And then WHAM! Arcade Fire tacked ""No Cars Go"" (a crummy, excessively-layered dud reminiscent of the Thompson Twins) and ""My Body Is A Cage"" (just an overall snoozer) onto the backend of this record and I couldn't help but feel disappointed. Overall, this is a nice move up from Funeral, however I can't help but feel like maybe the band should've quit while they were ahead...or else adjusted the track list. Still worthy of 4 stars on the strength of the other songs."
5,Great Follow-Up,Expectations were high for Arcade Fire's follow-up to Funeral. At least mine were. I didn't think they could pull it off. They did.
3,Disappointed ...,"The bottom line is: this is no Funeral, not even close. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad album, it just doesn't stack up against Funeral. Admittedly, Funeral was ingenious and any follow-up short of perfect would not compare well with it, yet Neon Bible left me unsatisfied. The sound seems too polished, and this detracts from the strength and emotion of the songs. The album is much darker than expected, however doesn't contain the same edge that Funeral had."
3,Ok but not my cup of tea,"Music was fine, good beat, some interesting lyrics but overall it didnt appeal to me very much. Still a fairly nice album and would appeal to a diverse group of music lovers."
4,Arcade Fire,This group has potential to break through into the majors - interesting use of instruments and rich vocals. A bit on the dark side but then that is what was intended.
3,"I really wanted to like this CD, but...","It's interesting how varied opinions of an album/book/etc. can be. I have spun this CD 5 times now. I really want to like it, but it's just not as inspired or genuine as Funeral. It sounds to me like the band had to strike while the iron was hot, and get a second CD out while the getting was good. There are a few good cuts, I'll use them in compilations. But as a whole the CD doesn't have the consistency and quality of Funeral. Just my opinion."
3,"Don't Have a Coronary, Folks... It's Just OK.","Where is the raw energy?I truly love Funeral, but this CD is just not moving me. Maybe I expected too much.With the exception of No Cars Go (which is a fine little pop tune), these songs are not catchy and they lack the energy, inventiveness, and big-sound drive that Funeral had.Black Mirror is especially dreary and bogged down. Ugh.Intervention sounds like a Bruce Springsteen cover song.I thought the album would grow on me, but I've spun it like 10 times now, and I'm not finding much to get into.So far, it's the most overrated album of 2007."
2,They should've stayed introspective,"I love <love>Funeral. Let's put it this way: If Funeral were a woman, I would marry it.I hate <hate> Neon Bible. Let's put it this way: If I married Funeral and it devolved into Neon Bible, I would spend every night at the strip club by the airport, and would cheat on it with The Dears'Gang of Losersor LCD Soundsystem'sSound of Silver.All glibness aside <too late>, Funeral is one of my three favorite albums of all time. It was a perfect mixing of both sorrow and joy. that seems to be a combination that works for them. But this album comes off as petulant and angry, which is really shocking when compared to the tone of Funeral.This album makes me sad more than it makes me feel anything else. Not because the music stirs my emotions; but because it's sad to see a band so good do something so bitter."
4,"Richly rewarding / layered / recommended for fans - ""good ears""","Pros:- It's the Arcade Fire- Propulsively grim, thematic and compelling. Completely gels after multiple spins- Evidence of great musicianship, dedication and talent- Thrilling and sobering all at onceCons:- Expect Funeral part II? Don't (for me, it's a pro)- Spotty lyrics- Can be a bit same-sounding- Title track Neon Bible feels unfinished and is a weaker track than the rest of the album- The Well and the Lighthouse sounds like a terrible Enigma and / or Enya song title"
4,very good album,"I should have never bought the special edition version because it didn't come with extra liner notes or a bonus cd, dvd, etc. This album is very good. I like this band a lot."
5,As Good as the First!,"Unquestionably this album gets better with every listen! After the first listen I wasn't sure but after a few more I'm simply blown away. Every track minus about 4 is as good as it will get. You can feel a Springsteen and Calexico influence on a few of the songs.The best tracks are Intervention, Ocean of Noise, The Well and the Lighthouse, No Cars Go, and My Body is a Cage (fantastic Organ!).It is different from the first one but truly still such a grand orchestra sound. NO SOPHMORE SLUMP HERE!"
2,Disappointing,"I actually purchased this cd after watching ""Sunday Morning on CBS"". The band I saw on the show was entertaining and eccletic. I found the cd to be filled with talent, but it lacked the interesting energy I anticipated."
4,A great follow-up to Funeral,"To get the bad out of the way, I'll admit that Win's vocals can get a little annoying and bloated in this album. That and Black Wave really isn't a good song at all.Otherwise, the whole album flows almost flawlessly, the diversity and richness in sound is wonderful and dynamic, the artwork is beautiful, and there are a number of fantastic songs that rival those found on Funeral.Favorite songs so far:Black MirrorOcean of NoiseThe Well and the LighthouseNo Cars GoMy Body is a Cage"
5,Absolutely stunning...I would give it more than 5 stars if I could,"The more I listen to Neon Bible, the more I am floored by the songs that Arcade Fire have put together in this effort. For starters, one amazing thing is that Win Butler and company manage to keep within themselves. This album is not an incredible departure from Funeral. But the sound is bigger, the lyrics are richer and the impact is deeper. Every song unfolds slowly and purposefully. There is not a single bad song on the album. I have heard some people complain about the production on the album but I personally don't find the production to be problematic. They use many more instruments than on Funeral, and there is a certain lo-fi quality to the production. But this what Arcade Fire has always been about in some ways. We still have a ways to go in 2007, but so far this is album is the undisputed best album of the year."
3,Interesting,It was interesting to taste the sound of Arcade Fire.There are a few sinphonic elements mixed in the new generation rock of the group.The rythm is OK and the ideas stimulating like the title of the album.Can we consider this music a starting point for a future project of rock innovation?
3,Another emperor's new clothes ?,"It's ok, but like anything else that's overhyped, it doesn't live up to the hype. Yes, there are varied instruments, and there are some great songs on here, but there is a decent amount of filler masquerading as 'art'. As sophomore efforts go it's no better than Sam's Town, or October; it's certainly no Heaven Up Here.Kinda reminds me of Kid A, so many people claimed they loved it and it was the greatest thing ever; but before you knew it the used CD stores had more copies than you could shake a stick at (remember CD stores ?). This one isn't that bad, it's just not all it's being cracked up to be.I'm sure it'll be a great college-age hit, a Bauhaus for the 2K's."
4,i would say it is very good,it sounds alot like funeral. i mean compositionally it is extremely similar. but it has soul. i really like it
2,"If that's all there is, then lets keep dancing...","Arcade Fire should have published a book of poetry rather than boring us with a cd of words set to music. Neither the compositions, arrangements, nor production measures near in quality to, ""Funeral,"" but even judging it in its own right, sans comparison, it is a rather vapid album. Most of the songs have the same aped-Springsteen vocal rhythms and a mush of instrument sounds pervades with little textural variation throughout.I enjoy the songs, ""Black Mirror,"" (which excited my anticipation for this cd) and, ""The Well and The Lighthouse,"" but otherwise couldn't keep my finger off the skip-track button.I'll be perusing the Dover Thrifts."
3,Not as good as Funeral (and why the wasteful paper wrap?),"3.5 stars actually, but I gave this 3 stars vs 4 (for some balance- too many gushing 5 star reviews here).This is a decent follow-up to Funeral. I loved Funeral the first time I heard it, but Neon Bible took several listens to grow on me...but let's not kid ourselves, it's no Funeral.I took off 1 star because the album isn't as good as Funeral, and also because the production isn't too good (I know they recorded it in a church). Also, I'm taking off 0.5 stars because of the totally unnecessary paper wrap for the cd jewel case. Funeral came in a paper cd case, so I thought they were being very environmentally conscious or their label was cheap. So I guess they're going to the other extreme now."
3,Dissapointed,"When I heard a few months back about Aracde Fire's upcoming album I was very excited. And even more so after reading Spin's (or maybe it was Blender) review of the album calling it fantastic and giving it five stars.To be fair, there are a few good tracks. Keep the Car Running and a few others. But most of them didn't have much of an original sound as did most of the songs on funeral. And then there are songs like Black Mirror that made me just go UGH.All in all it wasn't that bad of an album, but if you were expecting another 'Funeral' like I was, you won't be every pleased."
4,Not that good,"In deed it's a ""good"" second records, but seems to me that the flame of Funeral has vanished, and I'm not the only one sain' this, the only great songs on this one are No Cars go, wich came on the EP, Black mirror and I can't recall the others, but it's 5 out of 11."
2,let down,"I had big expectations for this album and it let me down. I would say after about 5 listens that there is one hit on the album. That being song number 4 - ""Intervention"". The songs just dont blow me away like the previous album. Also many religious refrences. I was dissapointed with this album......"
5,Not Funeral 2.0...Great on its own merits,"This album is in no way Funeral pt. 2. It sounds completely different, which means these guys and gals are as talented (actually more) than we thought all along. This album reminds me of a lot of things, as you see in these varied reviews, but the great thing is that you can't exactly place it. And it only reminds me of things I love.Wonderfully crafted and detailed, it takes multiple listens, as did Funeral, for this album to get under your skin. But when it does, it does."
5,"Not like Funeral, but still Great!","Funeral was an excellent album so it took me a while to get into Neon Bible and really appreciate it. This album is just as good as the Funeral but for different reasons. The band has progressed it's sound and taken a positive step forward (not sticking to same formula).The biggest difference bwtn both albums was the drums. The drums are hard, loud, intricate on the Funeral. On Neon Bible, they seem to be more in the background (maybe bc of the mixing) and seem to be more complementary rather than driving the songs' direction. Now it's the strings, brass, keys, guitars, singing that seem to guide the songs and take over the drums.That said, this album is great. It took a few listens to appreciate it but this one is up there with Funeral."
4,Wicked It Is !,"When Michael Rose left Black Uhuru, many thought he'd be done and over with. After returning to the scene in the 90's, Rose more than proved that he WAS Black Uhuru.The man's a downright genius! What he does with his Jah-given voice on Dance Wicked is portray his exact mood and his character: jumpy, independent, unconventional, short tempered.On this album, his voice is layered, each new layer adding a specific and necessary depth to the last. (Check out the dub version Dub Wicked to find out just how necessary those layers are).""Urgency"" is a word that springs to mind when checking out these tracks; an noun that holds true meaning to those also familiar with the sound of musicians/producers Mafia and Fluxy, who add their incomparable beats to the Golden Voice.Best played: during a weekend of heartbreak, a night of puppy love, or indeed just before playing Dub Wicked."
3,Bible For Dummies-Only an overview,Book gives a generalized summary of the Bible. Very little interpretation. Good for basic reading/introduction.
5,Satisfied Customer!!!,"Received my order in great condition which was of utmost importance since it was for a gift! Letting your fingers ""do the walking,"" is a great way to shop especially when it is a good experience; would definitely order again!"
4,Using for Lenten Study,I am using this resource for my Lenten Bible Study. A number of parishoners who do not normally attend studies are coming. A few have noted that they never came to studies before because they did not understand the Bible enough to attend and we afraid of being embarrased.The discussions are lively. The book is well organized. The authors seem to pare down the wide scope of Biblical Scholarship into presentations that allow the reader to make educated choices of which school of thought more accurately represents what they believe.This would also be a great resource for individual study without clergy leadership.
1,Not very accurate.,"Writing my review for the Pocket Edition, which I couldn't find during my search.On page 30 of the Pocket Edition, it says ""God promises Noah never to destroy the earth again"".This is not accurate. God's Covenant with Noah is in Genesis 9:11, and reads ""I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.""Some may call this a minor discrepancy, but some would say that the Eve's answer to the Serpent was a minor discrepancy, too.I don't like to read Bible help books that introduce inaccuracies, so I'll toss this into the recycle bin and won't finish it."
3,Great book with a great message.,The Bible really is for dummies! It's such a simple yet accurate message.I recommend a book on the natural sciences if you really want to read something useful.
3,"""Little Piggy""","This is a cute stuffed piggy that I purchased for my girlfriend who loves pig related stuff. Shipped quickly and it's a soft, loveable little gift for any age."
3,Skuttle,I haven't used it long enough to tell how well it functions. It's a filter that's been in place one month.
4,How times change where proper speach is concerned...,"I found the book very humorous. It was contridictory to many of the currentstandards, however quite insightful as to the nature of the cyclical patterns of the""Upper Class"". I would recommend it for anyone interested inlinguistics and the different subjective views of what is correct or incorrect."
4,Searching,Very interesting material with more detail than I have read elsewhere about the preparations and the voyage. If anything I would have loved to know more.
2,"Fun, just not durable","I bought one of these for my son who loves it. He's 3. However, the poles are pretty flimsy and split easily when a wild toddler decides to jump on the tent. The felt is not very sturdy, either. My son and his friend ripped the felt on one of the entrances going in and out. However, I will say that if I can return this one, I'll get another one, just because they're great for sleepovers. Just keep the wild ones off the outside of the tent!"
2,Didn't Stay Inflated,"That's pretty much it. We set this up, it wasn't too hard, it looked cute and my son had fun playing in it for a few minutes before we had to go out - but when we came back to it the next day all the air had leaked out of the inflatable bottom so I returned it. Had to pay for shipping it back, but I got a full refund so I was only out about half of what I spent on it. Still can't recommend it, though."
4,Want Quality ? Buy This !,"I am a computer techie, and over the years have used cables from many different companies. These quality of these cables is much higher than that offered by competitors. You won't be disappointed."
1,DIDN'T EVEN WORK!,"We really needed an automatic feeder for our cat because we were going away for the holidays and needed to make sure our cat didn't eat all his food as soon as we walked out the door. I was excited when I found this one, however it didn't even rotate at all. I followed the directions but nothing happened. I left it overnight, changed the setting, anything and it never made a noise. I sent it back and went and bought one at Pet Smart that works great."
4,Good for dumb animals,"Directions for use were unclear. I had to call the phone number given to ask questions twice. Once I had it together and figured out how to use it, it worked well...until my one cat learned how to open it and get to the food without waiting for the timer to open the next section. After 2 days of use, he now can get to all 6 compartments within minutes of the filled feeder being set on the floor! My other cat waits until the whirring noise announces the next compartment being opened, and races towards the now empty feeder."
1,Does not work,Just arrived and does not work. Was very difficult to get together correctly after putting in battery and then it would only forward occasionally. I am off to the pet store to buy one and I will be returning this one.
2,Not for clever cats,"I bought two of these for my two cats. One cat figured out how to get her paw under the lid and open it. At first I thought that she managed to pry it open when it was rotating, but just to try again, after 6 months not using, I filled one section and put it down. Within 3 minutes, the cat got the lid off and the other cat moved in to eat. So, if you have a clever, curious cat, this won't work for you. Great if you have lazy cat."
4,Great for Traveling Owners,"It works great, I just wish the top was clear so when my neighbors came to see if it was working they could see food had been used. Instead they just left cat more food! I have now used it twice when leaving for a business trip, used with wet food for an old cat. When I came home it was empty. The onl other challenge is that you have to start the timer the day you leave at the time you want it to feed. You can only pick from 6, 12, 24 hours.So I turned it on 24 when I fed cat at 6am..."
3,Works as described - not good for cats.,"First - it works just like it says it will. Very happy with that part. However, my cat is terrified of this thing.At first, he wouldn't go near it. He just sat in the middle of the kitchen and cried. If I tried to put him next to it, he would completely panic and run from the room. I thought he would get used to it after a while, but only somewhat. After 3 weeks, he would only eat if I stood next to him - and then reluctantly. And if there's any noise at all while he's near the food tray, he panics and runs.My guess is that the first time he tried to eat, the thing moved with his head in the way. It doesn't move fast enough to hurt him, or cause him to get stuck - but that's the only reason I can imagine that he's so afraid of this. Maybe if there was a motion sensor, that would help. But - you get what you pay for :)"
2,Great product... if it works,"I've been using one of these for my cat for four years with great results, so when I adopted a second cat recently, I ordered another. The motor sounded like it was dying and the speed of the turn would vary randomly. After a day of use I noticed that it wasn't turning at all unless I gave it a shake. I promptly returned it and the replacement had the same issue only worse. This one wouldn't stop at one turn. I got a refund and will buy at a store so I can make sure it works first. My first one has held up great and never had an issue with it, so I'm hoping this is an isolated issue of quality control."
1,HUGE design flaws.,"The plastic lid easily falls off, leaving the button to advance the tray open for your cats paw to smack. The cat also figured out how to move the tray, getting all 6 days of food in about 10 minutes. I am returning this. For the price, totally not even a little worth it if you cat has even average intelligence."
5,As Advertised,"It's worked as advertised, so far. My cat has to have soft food, so we were concerned about overnighters. It has rotated as advertised (we have on 6 hour rotation), and there have been no glitches.... we have used it 6 times so far. No problems."
2,Great for dry food but not wet food,I always appreciate when folks write reviews because then you really know what you are getting. If you are looking for a feeding dish for you pet who eats wet food stop here....hire a pet sitter. I have an older cat which requires feeding twice a day. I work longer hours but they aren't long enough to warrant a pet sitter daily. The first time i tried this item the containers thawed out by the end of the day. I did try it on a weekend when i was home to make sure the food did not go bad by sitting out in the open for hours without being chilled. The second time I froze the later half of the days food so by the time it got around to feeding time again 12 hours after putting out the food it was just the right tempature. Good luck if you have a cat like mine!
4,Easy to use,"I have only used this a couple of times, but it has worked just fine. It's a little inconvenient that you can't set an actual time, but that's not such a big deal. I bought it for weekend trips out of town and I think it should work just fine for that. I wouldn't recommend canned food because there is no way it will stay cold for more than 24 hours--it's just small ice packs."
2,Meh.,"My cat started standing on the top of this while it rotates, and then the dish won't go to the next section of the feeder. My cat then wouldn't get fed and would be acting crazy and I couldn't figure out why until I realize it was no longer advancing. Then the other day I watched the dish advance and then just randomly go back to the empty section. The motor is blown. I guess it was ok for the price but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Don't even think you can change this battery,Worked great (although loud) until we tried to change the battery. Compartment never lined up after that (tried for an hour) rendering it useless. Poor design. Wish I never bought it.
4,Lentek 6-day auto ped dish,"This product has saved us from going crazy. Our cats were waking us up at 4:00 in the morning every day. The feeder works like a charm. The only drawback is that if the cats need to be feed at certain hours, the timer has to be started accordingly. Also, one of my cats turned out to be a little smarter than we thought and he figured out a way to remove the top off. Thanks to one of the reviewers of the product we were able to find a solution to this problem. There are some holes on the bottom of timer and on the bottom tray that match. You simply have to place two 12mm screws through the holes and secure the ends with nuts. The only bad thing about this is when you have to change the battery, you have to remove the screws first to do so."
1,Pet Dish,"The dish works great. The only issue i find is when you open it to refill the food it takes a few secs to align the top properly, but it is only a minor problem"
2,defective design and not programmable,"It's OK until it starts skipping over sections. I have owned 2 of these and both at some point got glitchy. There are not programmable, need frequent refilling, and not reliable while you are away. There seem to be better choices than this, but I haven't tried others yet."
2,that noise!,"i have had this product for about a year and a half and it works great, except for one problem, which has become increasingly worse. it is difficult to describe, but basically, the compartment that houses the battery is too small, and the battery pokes out and the compartment doesnt seal flat. there is a bit of a raised surface from the battery, and when the motor turns, it grinds against the surface creating this intensely loud ""CLICK CLICK CLICK"" sound. if it cant rotate completely, it starts to move counterclockwise, and it still gets stuck. believe me, its the worst sound to wake up to in the morning, and its even worse to come home late at night to see that the setting hasnt been able to move and kitty hasnt been fed. this product is poorly designed, look for something else, thats what im doing."
2,Defective,"Our feeder arrived defective -- the mechanism did not advance to the next feeding slot correctly. The return & refund were handled professionally & courteously. We bought another brand which, while more expensive, does work well."
4,pet feeder,"Love the dish. We were worried about our dogs tearing them apart, but they are secure. I wish the dish would hold more than 1 cup of food and it really is only for 5 meals since one compartment is always open. I would recommend this to all pet owners and will be giving as a gift to a friend."
5,Worked Perfectly,I went away for the weekend and left it for my cat. It was easy to set up and worked perfectly.
1,Don't sell used stuff that does not work!,"This was a used pet feeder, it never worked, it is bad business to sell junk and for Amazon to associate itself with companies who sell junk!"
2,It scared my cat,"This unit is too fiddly for frequent use. The top is hard to get off and on to add food to it. I thought maybe we were meant to advance the trays one at a time, but the instructions specifically say to lift the top to fill. Plus, if you don't fill all the trays when you put the top back on you have to make sure that the right trays are filled to expose the slots you want to. Plastic cover of on and off switch is cheaply made and falls right off. Why did they even bother? Finally this unit bears a striking resemblance to a roomba. As such my cat was afraid of it. He tried swatting it and stalking it, and it took a few days for him to get comfortable around it."
1,Absolute junk,"I bought 2 of these to feed our 2 cats while we went on holiday for 6 days. I bought them 6 weeks before we left to ensure they arrived on time. When they arrived I put in batteries and they appeared to work. I switched them off and then came back to them on the day before we were leaving. I switched them on and they did not work. I left them on during the day to see if they would advance, but they never did. I thought it was the batteries, so I went to buy new ones, however this did not help. In fact switching them on and off back random results of suddenly advancing then immediately returning back to the original position. And other random movements. Needless to say I could not use them and our poor cats had to do with buckets of dry food scattered randomly throughout the house. Naturally I returned them for a refund on my return. However I had to pay $12 for a new box and packing material as I had discarded the original boxes.Don't buy this junk !!!"
2,WARNING!!!!,"In theory, this pet feeder is GREAT. BUT... hungry cats can easily pop it open and gorge themselves. The lid pops off pretty easily, so buyer beware. If you have pets that are food driven, try another product."
4,review,"Excellent product. Works great. Allows me to keep cats at home, instead of boarding or having a cat sitter show up."
4,Great buy for the money,This product is a great buy for the money. I shopped around a lot and couldn't find anything to compare. This is the second one I bought. I've had the first one almost a year and it's still working. It is pretty quiet and the timer works well. My cats don't try to break into it like others seem to do. It won't work with wet food for 6 days though because the ice will not keep (since it's just water in plastic) but works well for a weekend away. It has eliminated me having to get up at 4:30am to feed the cats too!
2,Poor Functioning,"The item worked briefly, but has been sporatic and cannot be counted upon to do dispense food on a regular basis (which was why it was purchased)"
1,Good Luck,"To all ye who purchase this piece of garbage, Good luck:- figuring out how to remove the ""top"" from the ""base."" (The directions are useless.)- inserting the battery (the too-short cord provided results in only being able to install/insert the battery plug into the motor one way - one painfully ineffective and frustrating way).- opening and closing the ice ""packs"" to fill them with water (which are just very cheap plastic inserts). The caps are nearly impossible to remove, and warp after one fill since you'll be needing a fork to pry them off.- getting it to ""advance"" (my advance button was broken).- trusting it to work (I tried it on all three settings - it didn't work).I advise you of this as a grown man with a college degree (he said with a snark). I patiently read the ""directions"" and even had a friend attempt to set it up as well. It is defective - and yet even if we could get it to work, I feel that the junky plastic parts are not worth your money."
3,Great devise,This is a great devise and our cat loves it! It allows us to feed him when we're at home or away. We needed this years ago! It does the job wonderfully!
2,"Okay, until it died after 5 months","I bought this for my cats because they woke me up every morning for food. After some frustration getting it to turn at the correct hour, it worked okay for 5 months. Then it died.The lack of a time setting:Adjusts to 6 hour, 12 hour, and 24 hour settings. The problem: I wanted it to turn at 5 am when I'm not usually up so my cats would not wake me. That meant that I needed to be up at that hour to set the timer. Yuck. If the battery dies, start over and repeat.After 5 months of use (1 time per day), it will not turn on anymore. New batteries don't help, and this thing only has a 90 day warranty. Buyer beware."
1,Broke before the food was in it,"This arrived broken before we used it. the electronics with in this were destroyed, totally fried. It registered there was a battery, but the light kept blinking, and it wouldn't register to be programed. the wiring was totally faulty. furthermore, the lid and didn't fit quite right, and it was extremely light weight, it was clear that the compartments were not airtight, and that small paws could fit into the adjacent compartment. it was also not easy to reassemble, and i'm not sure how they intended the ice packs to work. they were hard plastic, inflexible, and were poorly seemed, so they leaked when water was poured in them, so they wouldn't have frozen well and easily leaked.it ended up being returned to amazon."
1,Very Disapointed !,"I actually purchased TWO of the exact same Lentek 6 Day Pet Dish. They both did not work. The first one did not work at all and the second one did not reveal the food openings in sequence, rather it skipped full compartments and revealed empty ones. I was counting on this product to feed the cat (who is awake at 4) in the morning so I can sleep better. This product did not do what it was supposed to in any sense of the term. My next step is to think about spending more on a functioning pet feeder, but nothing by Lentek."
3,neither thrilled nor disappointed,"Product meets its basic claims, however, design improvements are needed.-very very difficult to snap timer and trays together and line them up properly-ice packs leak-tray not dishwasher friendly - oversized and stops the washer arms from rotating-which direction is the rotation? Can it be indicated on the dish please? I will take a sharpie and mark it. This is important because I freeze a can of food for the feedings two days away, and dont want them to get THAT feeding on the day I leavecats have adjusted well to their ""space feeders"" and the product does what it claims, but its kinda a p.i.t.a. for the ownerI would like to see a feeder come out with a timer with hourly settings like a light timer, so I don't have to set up the feeder 6,12 or 24 hours exactly in advance of the cats mealtimes"
2,"Great for dry food, but the wet food just goes ""ehhhhh.""","I got this pet dish because my cat needs to be fed medicine (crushed up in his wet food) every 12 hours. This automatic pet dish looked like it fit the bill, plus it had space for ice packs. Well, I got it home and we tried it... but 1) it scared the cat (the noise is pretty loud) and 2) the ice packs turned to liquid in about 2 hours. By the time hour number 12 came around, the wet cat food was room temperature and my cat wouldn't go near it."
5,Best Pet dish ever!!!,"Love, Love, Love this bowl!!!! I have a cat that loves to eat!! We can cut down on his portions and set the timer to open every six hours, so we don't feel like we are starving him. Very handy for feeding while you are at work or away. I really don't know what we did before this bowl!!!!"
2,Lentek Pet Feeding Dish,This product is OK if you're only going away for a couple of days. I used it for about a week and now it is in he cupboard. I like the LeBistro Automatic feeder much better.
3,OK auto pet feeder,"I have had mixed results with this item. Sometimes it works, other times the motor does not appear to advance. Several times I came home from an overnight trip, and the open part was in the same position (i.e., it didn't advance), so my cat went hungry that night for his wet food (though I had left some dry food in a separate bowl). I like that it had a six-day cycle (or 6 12-hour intervals, however you set it) - others feeders are for only 2-cycles, I just wish it was more reliable."
1,Pretty useless...,"It worked for almost two days, then began failing to index properly with the food tray openings...it would advance, at approximately the proper time, but would stop before the tray was fully opened. I tried the ""advance"" button (BTW, that has about a two-minute delay before it actually executes after pressing the button), but the feeder constantly stopped midway between two tray openings rather than fully opening the next one. I tried a new battery, same result. This thing had potential, but it is poorly made, and not something I would ever trust to feed my kitty for even a day or two. I send it back to Amazon, and fully expect them to resolve the issue...I think I have only done one Amazon return before, but it went well."
1,Not impressed at all.,Ive tried 2 different auto feeders now and they were both completely worthless. I leave my dog all weekend long every weekend and he eats all his food in 5 minutes. So I buy the pet feeder! He breaks into them both in a matter of less then 5 minutes and eats 3 days worth of food. I might as well just keep throwing it in a bowl. If anyone knows of one that dogs cannot break into I am still in need on one! Thanks
3,It worked great for 10 months,"I bought this last January as I was going away for a few days and knew my cat needed to be rationed food. I've replaced the batteries once or twice but by October no matter how many times I change the batteries, it still malfunctions. Some days it doesn't turn at all, other days, only halfway or a quarter. It's just not reliable any more especially since I am gone most of the day. I guess on to the more expensive feeders now..."
2,My cat was to smart!,"I appreciated the idea of the product, but my cat was too smart for it. If he wanted more food, he could just lift the turning lid with his claws and knock the turning lid off track, giving him access to the entire 6 days worth of food. Even after reading a review from another individual, saying that she didn't think her cat was smart enough to figure it out, he did, I didn't think mine was either; I was wrong. I did up returning it. If the turning lid wouldn't have been able to be moved by my cat, I would have kept it."
2,It does not work for smart cat,"My cat is too smart for this product. The first week works fine, but she figures out after a week, she can just put her paw under the cover to lift the cover out and move the dish cover to other dish which contains food, after that, the motor will not turn the dish cover because the motor can't control the dish cover and the whole dish cover runs loose and moves freely. That is the design fault, if the manufacture makes the motor and dish cover engage more, even the smart cat can't open it.If you have a low IQ cat, it will work perfect for your cat."
1,Does not work,"Put brand new batteries in it. As a test, I set it to change dishes after six hours (overnight). It did not do it. So I tried another brand new battery and set it for another six-hour interval at 5:11 a.m. this morning. At 12:20 p.m., when I returned home from an errand, it still had not changed dishes. It does not work. I'm willing to give it another trial run this evening but based on what I've seen thus far, I just blew $36 on an item that is worthless. (As an aside, I went to my local Petsmart with the idea of buying either one of two different automated feeders, retailing for $55 and $59. The store manager told me to save my money and instead urged me to buy a $12 non-electronic autofeeder, the kind that looks like the self-filling water dishes. THAT spoke volumes to me.)"
1,Smart cats can defeat this!,I thought this was a great idea until I saw my cat pushing the cover around in the opposite direction...
5,"Great, reliable auto feeder...but not racoon-proof!","I have used this feeder for many, many years, even leaving for 5-6 days at a time. Unfortunately, the racoons have figure out how to pop it open, so I can't rely on it anymore.Anyway, if not for the coons, I would trust this feeder. Don't overfill the sections, however, or the feeder top won't spin."
1,"not for curious or hungry cats, or outdoor use","When we returned from being out of town, the top of the feeder was off, all the food gone, and two very angry cats were glaring at us accusingly. I suspect all the neighborhood cats had a party at our feeder. It's too easy to pry off the top. I am considering screwing in three flat L-shaped pieces of metal that could prevent an animal from prying off the top, while still allowing the device to turn and reveal the new food. But it's too bad Lentek doesn't make it more cat-proof already. I would only recommend this for old, weak indoor cats with no curiosity, and low appetite."
1,Defective right out of the box!,"This unit has no clock, only a timer. Feeding dish does not rotate at proper timer intervals and sometimes rotates two spaces at a time. In addition, you have to use a Phillips screwdriver to change the batteries, which is ridiculous. I bought two, and returned them both. We currently use theErgo 8-Day Auto Pet Feeder, which works much better."
3,Ok while it lasts,"It does an ok job while it lasts (in our case only 6 months). The timing function is limited (choose between 6, 12 and 24 hour intervals) and it's a nuisance having to activate the timing interval at 6 am (or 6 pm if you have a 12 hour interval) for the feeder to open at 6 am. Battery life is pretty bad, one (albeit of a cheap kind) battery lasts 3-4 weeks. The cat seemed to like it though, and was never able to try it open or in any other way disrupt its function."
1,Not reliable,There must have been a wiring problem because it did not reliably switch trays. It would not work at all with battery cover on. We tried multiple batteries but that didn't help.
3,worked great at first...,"i had this feeder for 6 months or so. worked well for the most part but took some abuse from my cat who jumps on it when it starts to open each time, literally standing on it while it would turn open... think the motor burned out, it started acting like it was confused or low on battery and wouldn't turn all the way to open, then stopped working all together.was good while it lasted."
1,Cats had it open lickety split. Unusable,"Our cats are not particularly clever. But, they had this device open in no time. We have a cat mate device which in several years they have not been able to open. This device is just not usable for its intended purpose."
3,happy,It works great but my cat has figured out how to turn the dial to the next feeding. She just kind of helps herself to more food when she gets hungry!
4,Good product,This feeder is a good product and much better than the feeders that I have tried in other brands. The motor is quiet and the construction is durable. It is a little bit of a challenge to get the lid open the first few times you try but after that it is easy. However our cat sitter has never learned how to master the thing and leaves the lid off and feeds by filling one tray at a time when we are away. I would recommend this feeder to anyone.
1,poorly developed.,"They could have done a way better job of constructing this. The timer starts the 6, 12, 24 hours the moment you turn it on so if you need it to go off at 5am you need to get up at 5am and set it otherwise it will go off whenever you first put it together and turned it on. They should have added a clock to fix that. You feel like you're going to break it putting it back together because it doesn't easily fit and click into place."
1,Disappointed,It was cracked when I received it and it would not stop going around when I put the batteries in . Also it was very loud.
1,Save your money. It's worthless!,"I bought this cat feeder to use when I was going to be gone overnight. It was easy to program and looked like it was going to do the job. The cat had the lid off in less than 2 minutes, before I even left. Save your money. This would not work even for a really stupid cat."
1,Could never get it to work,"I could never get this to work. The dish would spin to one dispenser, stop for less than a second, then keep spinning to the next dispenser. Unfortunately I didn't get around to opening this until after it was eligible to be returned."
1,Still Not Working After 48 Hours,"I have had it for two days now to try and give my pet treat when I am not home to keep them occupied. After 48 hours of loading the battery and filling the dishes, the thing has not move at all. The light is on and blinking and it was set to run every 12 hours. My pets can smell the treats inside and one wanted to start trying to force it open. If it doesn't open in 1 more day, I just may let him before I throw it out."
2,broke after 6 months of use,I loved this cat feeder until it just stopped working right before i went out of town!! I am hoping its still under warranty. I will contact seller.
2,Good Idea but...,"my cocker spaniel snapped the lid off in 20 seconds to get to the other food. Might work well for a cat. It also has ice cube trays inside to help keep food fresh. you can set it to feed every 6-12-24 hours.Company charges a 20% restocking fee on returns, plus you pay for shipping."
1,Failed while on vacation!,I am really upset regarding this product. I bought it a month ago specifically for my Presidents Day long weekend vacation. I have been gone 4 days and this thing is opened in between 2 food trays and my 4 month old kitten is upset because he is hungry. Cheaply made and do not waste your money.
1,awful!!! i really would not give this 1 star if the website didn't make me,my cat pushes the lid over to the next feeding on his own. he is eating more than he should. i would love to get my $ back on this. Strongly suggest you don't buy this product!!!!
2,not as good as I hoped,The dish didn't go all the way around to give the full amount of serving it was a good thing I had a friend check in for me
2,I know this product can work...but this one did not!,We had this product before and it worked amazingly for several years. This new one I ordered does not work at all however. The timer simply does not even open to the next portion! Luckily Amazon is sending a new one. I hope this new one will work as designed!
1,Lentek 6-Day Automatic Pet Dish by Lentek,"This product does not work for a dog. I put 2 meals in to try it out, and set the timer for 12 hours. The battery died in about an hour, and my dog got into both food trays. She was then overfed. I tried to not give this product ANY stars, but the screen won't let you get past if you don't rate at least one star. It does not deserve ANY stars. I have seen this product in many places...NOBODY should sell it !!!"
1,NO FOOD,"USED THIS A FEW DAYS, IT STOPPED WORKING, MY DOG WASNT GETTING ANY FOOD.WASTE OF MONEY. SO I TRIED CHANGING THE BATTERIES , STILL WASNT ROTATING!"
4,Auto feeder for a good night's sleep!,"I bought this for the kitty who has been waking me up at 3:00am begging for a snack. Worked great until last week, when kitty decided to start waking me up at 2:58am to tell me the feeder is about to rotate!Seriously, this product has worked very well. The ice keeps the food cool for about 6 hours only. By 12 hours everything was room temperature, so I've started freezing the food to make it last up to 12 hours for the days I work late.The only down side is that since I'm not using all 6 compartments, it's a little difficult to get the top lined up, reassembled to the bottom tray, and rotated to the right compartment, but once you get the hang of it, not too bad."
4,I don't feel TOO guilty about leaving the cat for a weekend,"This works well! Just a few things that everyone should know. 1. Don't FILL the trays... this can affect the cover turning, and make it stick. 2. Fill the ice trays fully, because you won't be able to remove the covers once they're in place. 3. My cat is a little weird, and I found that when I put the auto-feeder where his bowl usually goes, he was reluctant to get to the far side of the device. Put it out in the MIDDLE of the floor, so that access to all the trays is easy for your animal.I usually have someone look in on him if I'm gone more than 2 days, even if he's using the feeder, just to keep him company, and make sure he's OK.Go on small vacations without having to worry that your pet is going without... recommended!"
4,Good product for price,"Good product for the price. There are nicer ones that cost a considerable amount more, but this does the job just fine. It does pop apart if it is dropped (my cat was knocking it off where it was placed to get all the food when it broke open). Its very easy to use and set up."
5,Best food timing dish ever!!!,"This is very user friendly. You pop in the battery and set it to feed once evey 6, 12 or 24 hrs. It is continuous. Does not have to be reset unless battery dies. I only feed my cat dry food, so I am not able to talk about the moist food feature. I now use it all the time. It has become my only feeding dish. My cat now gets fresh food every 6 hrs and the food stays fresh and sealed. No more wasted food. My cat loves it!"
1,Disappointing (as usual),"Why is it so ridiculously difficult to make automatic pet feeders that are reliable? I have a light timer that comes on at almost exactly the same moment every day. My alarm clock goes off at the same time every day. My COFFEE MAKER can brew coffee at the same time every day. And yet, there doesn't seem to be a way to make an automatic cat feeder that functions reliably every day. I have two cats who need food regulation. If I had two feeders that went off generally within a couple of minutes of one another, that would be great. Unfortunately with these, one wasn't even OPENING reliably, then when I returned it for a new one, the other stopped opening at reliable times. Just randomly. WTF."
4,Sleeping again!,I have 2 cats who start waking me up at 0500 to eat. Not anymore! The timer works great; set to go off twice a day. No problems with my cats trying to pry to lid off either. I agree w/ other reviews that a timed timer would be nice and a identifying mark to let you know when the bowl needs to be refilled.
3,Automatic Pet Feeder,"The automatic feeder is o.k. It rotates on time and hold the amount of food is states it should. I bought it to leave out ""wet"" food. The only thing I don't like is the ice packs. They thaw out in a day, so any wet food left in there longer than two days actually spoils. I use it when I am gone for the weekend, but any longer than it's NO GOOD, at least for wet food."
2,"Okay, but could be better","Purchased this product for feeding cats on W/E as we gor to our house in VT each W/E. Instructions were very vague and obviously not written by someone who has a grasp of the english language. Because of vague instructions, this feeder did not feed my animals but starved them for 2 days. Well constructed, comes with ice packs and need a 9 volt battery. Has an on and off switch which is nice and you can electronically advance to a new feeding station. However, unless can deal with the vague instructions and have the timne to play with it, I would not buy this prodcut again if I want to feel secure that my cats were fed on a daily basis.I also found that the 6-12-24 hour settings are not convenient, and a clock setting that you can set (AM/PM)times would insure consistent feeding times."
4,Not as many feedings as you think.....,"This item does the trick. I feed my cat twice a day, so although it has 6 compartments, it only lasts me 3 days. Plus, there is always a compartment exposed. Therefore I really only get 2.5 feedings out of it. The quality is good for the price. It is sometimes hard to fit the battery operated portion back into the middle of the circle. My cat is not scared of it. It is perfect for leaving for a long weekend. Now I need to figure out a better way to keep water out for her."
1,Please don't bother!,"My cats had it open with a couple of hours! It maybe worth it if you have a cat who is not inquisitive (do they exist?!!) but it certainly wasn't for me! I love the idea and if anyone knows of an affordable feeder that works, I'm all ears!"
1,Junk,"This pet dish did not work as advertised. Our trusty cat - 1, Lentek 6-Day Automatic Pet Dish - 0"
2,Form does not follow function,"This product looks modern and sleek, but after the first week I noticed my cat left scratches on the plastic. I could not understand why so many reviewers could not figure out how to program this, or complained about needing to set the timer at a certain time.I assumed this product was working fine -- even went on a weekend trip. However, today, several weeks later, I noticed that my cat had somehow figured out how to get food out of the other compartments !! I am not sure how long this has been going on, but I am disappointed that I can't use this now (and am returning it).Unfortunately, there are not many automatic cat feeders that have consistently outstanding reviews. I am going to give the slightly more expensive automatic feeder with the LCD screen, and voice message option (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GJNFFC/ )"
3,"Works ok, has some drawbacks","We bought one of these in Sept. 2007; it's now Dec. 2009 and I'm shopping for a new automatic feeder. The motor and/or the timer have quit working (even with a new battery).Personally I think it has numerous design flaws, especially for someone who has arthritis or other manual dexterity problems. It's not easy to pop out the center motor piece in order to refill the feeder. The buttons are not ergonomically easy to use. To replace the battery, you have to go get a screwdriver to remove the battery compartment's lid.It does what it says it will do, so no complaints there. And maybe two years is about all you can expect from this kind of mechanical gizmo. But I will not buy this model again."
2,Wanted to like this,"I wanted to get an automatic cat feeder so that my cat wouldn't wake me up at 5 am, and also so that she could eat more regularly scheduled meals and lose weight. I really liked the idea of this since you get to pick the portion size, and I didn't have any problems with her trying to get to the next meal early. The problem I had was that the timer on this thing is totally off. Sometimes it worked fine, and other times it wouldn't feed her until hours after it was supposed to. Sometimes I wasn't home when it was scheduled to feed her, so I had no idea that she hadn't been fed until I heard it turning hours later. I couldn't count on this to work properly, so I returned it and switched to the Crown Majestic. It was a little more expensive, but far more reliable."
1,has not been helpful,"First off I feel like it was not an honest ad, I feel like it should say 5 day feeder, because the first tray is open so he starts with one empty. It said that it could hold 2-3 cups of food per container, but I cannot even get one cup of dog food in each one. On top of that it has been really hard to use. When I turned it on (batteries not included) nothing happened so I assumed that it was set and 24 hours later it would rotate, instead it rotated 6 hours later, and then did 24 hours after that. I am assuming that it was tuned on and then turned off and maintained the original start time. It was very confusing. My dog sitter ended up not using it. I wish it had a way to say ""24 hours from now"" but it's doing its own thing. I don't recommend this item."
3,Cat v. Feeder,"I have now ordered this feeder twice. My previous one lasted about 7 months and then mysteriously quit on me. I have three cats and one of them is the hungriest, most determined, trash cat I have ever seen. I needed an automatic feeder for many reasons and the hungry, hungry cat was one. She is a break in artist and this feeder is like a fortress. No matter how hard all three cats gang up on this thing it never relinquishes the food until the set time. If you have a houdini like cat this will be a good choice. I have to only give it 3 stars because it died on me. It works like a charm, is easy to set up, durable, and the battery life is great. For the price and the different feeding options as well as how many food compartments it can't be beat. Be warned though, once it dies its never coming back."
4,Works good,Overall works good. Is a bit tough to align motor mechanism after filling compartments. Wish it could be set for 8 hours but otherwise works fine.
2,poorly designed,"The cover rotates, not the dish - so the unit needs to be placed so your dog can reach it from all sides. This doesn't work in my kitchen, I feed my dog at the end. It is also somewhat small. I have a small yorkie who eats 1/4 cup of small kibble. This unit would work for that quantify, if you have a bigger dog I don't think it would work. I'm returning it. It seems sturdy, so if the design works for you I would highly recommend it."
2,Stopped working after 2 months,"My cat is an early morning beggar, and expects to be fed again every time I walk past her food bowl. In an attempt to break these habits I bought this pet feeder based on the positive reviews. It was really wonderful for two months of daily use and then it stopped working. I thought at first it needed fresh batteries, but it is the motor. The Lentek warranty that comes in the box is good for 2 months, and I had owned it for 2 1/2 months when it broke. I know some customers have gotten more than 2 years of use with this feeder, so maybe I got a faulty device. My experience with this product is only worthy of 2 stars, but otherwise I would recommend it. I have not contacted Lentek yet, or tried to return it through Amazon, but I would like this product to be replaced or to be reimbursed. A two month return window seems unfair considering it barely lasted that long."
1,Broke after one use,"This is actually the third time I've ordered this product, because the first two only lasted a year each. Unfortunately, this last one seems to be be even worse than my other two. The second time I went to open it up to reload it, the center controller broke into two pieces. All the screws came out and didn't work right even after I tried to fix it. The convenience of the product is great - assuming it works - but it's a worry that they're made so cheaply that I can't even open it up twice without it breaking."
2,kitten able to break in very easily,"I had one of these items for about 6 months for my adult cat and I loved it because he never tried to break in to the other compartments, but as soon as I got a 6 month old kitten and ordered a second one, the kitten broke into it on the first day. Not only did he eat all the food in all of the compartments while i was at work, but he also broke into my other cats dish and ate all of his food as well. needless to say, he ended up getting sick from eating so much food. Plus, he taught my adult cat how to get into it, so they both know how. I ended up just throwing both of them away since they ended up being worthless. if you have a cat that is motivated by food in any way, this is not for you because it is very easy for them to open up."
4,Pet feeder,"So far, I like this pet feeded. I bought it for my rabbit since I'm planning a week long vacation in a month. I've been testing it, and have completely stopped giving him food myself since it seems to work so well.My only concern is that it doesn't seem to feed at the same time everyday. I'm a little concerned that the timer doesn't work well and it may skip meals at some point or the battery may completely die. So far so good though."
1,Broke,"This was nice when it worked, but it broke after about 6 months. My cat is on a strict diet for health reasons, and she has to have an exact amount of food per day - no more, no less. This feeder started acting really weird. Sometimes it would rotate a feeding section and then reverse two, or sometimes it wouldn't rotate at all when it was supposed to - allowing my cat to eat more than she's allowed, or not feeding her at all. Very unreliable!!"
3,nice but drains batteries,It would be nice if this had an AC adapter because it really drains batteries. Other than that it works fine. Just make sure you have fresh batteries in there before you go on a long trip otherwise you'll have hungry cats when you get home.
1,Very poor quality,"I purchased this item to use for my cat who is on a strict diet and needs 3 small meals a day. When I opened it up, I immediately noticed how flimsy the item was. Very thin plastic. The top didn't to attach to the bottom that well at all and left a gap.After I tried to program it, all it did was spin around and around opening to each compartment, it never stopped. I actually sent it back as defective."
3,Convenient feeder,"This feeder was a life-saver. Our cat is overweight and can be very demanding. And...he tends to gorge himself and then get sick. With this feeder, no more barfing episodes. My only disappointment, was the feeder was missing parts. It was advertised as coming with 2 cool packs which were not in the box. The box itself was damaged in shipping, but the feeder seems pretty hardy, and works fine."
3,hard to load,"The timer works, however it is hard to line up the dish and the timer. Was able to feed the cat but it is tricky to use."
5,Great Product,"Something that I didn't think about was the $$ saved on the cat food I was wasting, as well as having a chubby kitty because I would over feed her when I was away for a few days. No complaints, it works great!"
1,I returned it and got a refund!!,"I bought this product for a vacation I was taking. Unfortunately, I received it too close to my departing date to give it a true trial. So I filled it up several nights before leaving and trialed it briefly. Well, all I can say is I am glad I had a neighbor check on the cat while I was away, to ensure the feeder was rotating...it did not!!! I changed batteries several times thinking that was the problem..no the product was just a piece of junk! So I cleaned it out and shipped it back for a refund!!!"
3,6 days is stretching it a bit...,"We got this for our cats so that we could go on extended weekend trips. The first one that we got didn't work: the slightest wiggle would cause the cover to advance one station. Thanks Amazon for the immediate exchange! The second one works, at least as far as the electronics is concerned. However, for keeping wet food cold for more than just a few hours, the ice-packs are just not big enough. Maybe if they were filled with that blue gel and stayed colder longer, but with water, even salt water, they just don't stay cold enough. With dry food, the unit is great. With wet food in a warm climate, not so great."
1,Device Skips days of feeding,I used this device to feed my cat over a vacation and the device skipped days of feeding resulting in my cat getting significantly less food than she was supposed to. She was fine but rather angry with me.I have since tested this device by numbering the trays and checking to make sure that the lid rotated every 24 hours. The problem is that the lid is rotating randomly. Some days it would not rotate at all and others it would skip over 2-3 food dishes.I do not recommend buying this product as it did not reliably feed my pet.
5,Lentek 6-day Automatic Pet Dish,We had an older Automatic pet Dish which was more complicated to operate. This worked great - we used it for the four days we were away and would recommend it thus far.
4,Works just fine.,"We've had this feeder for a couple years, and use it when we go out of town for the weekend. Our cat is VERY fond of her food, but she has never managed to damage or force the feeder in any way. We only feed dry food, so I've never tried to use the ice packs, but it's good to know the option is there.This is a pretty basic model - you can't set it for a specific time in advance (it's just the 6/12/24 hours), it isn't super-quiet (but not super-loud either), and it's kind of clunky. But it works, and we are probably buying a 2nd one because we now have two cats."
2,The cat can move the cover,"It worked well for a few weeks, but now the cat has figured out that he can rotate the cover with his nose. I came home today and found the feeder completely empty even though I had filled it less than 24 hours ago (it's set on the 12-hour feeding cycle). After refilling it, I watched the cat clean out the open section, then gradually rotate the cover with his face to make another section available. I checked to make sure the cover was secured properly before watching the cat repeat his newfound skill. Time for plan B."
5,Travel buddy,"This thing is great. We travel a great deal and on short trips of a weekend or so, this is perfect. For longer trips, our pet sitter comes every other day and refills it, saving us money on her fees. It always works and we have a destructive cat who tries everything she can to open it. There are even teeth and claw marks on the top where she tried to get it open. We tried another model and she did get it open, not this one. Awesome product."
4,Elvis & I love the automatic pet dish!,"I love the feeder because it means I can spend the night at my boyfriend's without worrying about feeding Elvis. And Elvis loves it because it gives him food every 6 hours (more regularly than I do!). My one criticism is having to choose 6/12/24 hour increments. I wish there were more flexibility in setting the time. But for the price, it's great."
5,Pleased,"Great for a weekend trip out of town. The time adjustment is very handy to make sure food is always available. I fed 2 cats for 3 days with the 12 hour setting. Easy to clean, as well."
4,Great catsitter,Great product that allowed us to leave the cat at home for 5 days. He's the kind of cat that you can't just leave him a pile of food.... it would be gone in the first 8 hours. Like how it has different timer settings. Just make sure you have it properly assembled and press the button to advance it around so you know your pet won't starve.
4,Automatic Pet Dish Review,I have two cats that I feed two times a day so I ordered two of the cat feeders. The boxes came packed together in one box and the plastic tops over the timers were broken on both upon arrival. I set them up and began teaching the cats to use them. I have used other automatic cat feeders and the cats have ripped them apart. So far the cats have not figured out how to get into the dishes except when they are automatically opened. The only problem seems to be the noise when it opens it scares the cats away and it takes some time to get them to go back. I assume they will get used to the noise and in fact look forward to it. So far I am satisfied with the performance of the dishes and I am mostly happy with the product. Just should have been packaged a little better. Up to now I have tape on the two broken covers to the timers.
3,too low tech,"purchased 3 for long-term guest kitties: difficult to set timer, since there is no clock; even more difficult to set 3 to open simultaneously--a must!"
5,Great for travel,"Our cat loves this feeder - we use it when we are going out of town so the neighbor doesn't have to come feed her twice a day. We have a cat who will eat all the food she sees, so it has to be portioned out daily! When she hears it turn, she can't get there fast enough. The first time she saw it, she was a little leary - but the food reined her in!!!!!"
2,Biggest waste of money so far this year,"My automatic pet feeder showed up the other day. I have to say that I am really disappointed with the craftmanship of this product. For one, its a pain to get the center motor snapped in and out of the unit each time it has to be filled with food. For two, the plastic cover over the center motor unit falls off each time I open it up. Overall it just feels very cheaply manufactured, I bet this thing lasts a couple weeks, maybe a month."
2,Not the best,"As others have mentioned this unit has no clock. So since I want it to go off at 6:30 (15 minutes prior to when I wake up) I have to turn it on at 6:30. Then it only hold 5 days worth of food so when it's empty I have to fill it, then be sure I turn it back on at 6:30AM again. Very annoying."
1,Poor-quality construction,"I can tell that you are supposed to snap the center piece down firmly in order to get everything to work properly, but I found it very difficult to pull out the center piece in order to load food, and impossible to snap it back into place properly. I threw it in the trash without ever having used it successfully (who can be bothered to try to return this sort of thing to the seller?)."
5,Great product to help maintain diet,"I got this automatic pet dish because I was looking for someway to stop my cat's overeating. I didn't want to have to remember to give him a little bit of food every six hours so this dish does it for me. My brother did overfill it once so it wouldn't turn but when I just put small amounts of food in each compartment, it works great. I would recommend it to anyone who has a pet that has to eat everything it sees at once."
1,wet food auto feeder,I got this for wet food because it had ice packs for the bottom. Their is a flaw in the design. The motor key point doesn't secure the rotating plate. Cat's are very smart. After my car figured out that it was going to provide food. All she had to do was knock it off it's keyed position. Free assess to all compartment.
1,I do not recommend,"I returned this product because the quality and features were below my expectations. I thought it would be more rodent proof than my old one, but it's built really poorly. It didn't fit together well out of the box. The feeding options are limited. there is not a clock or ""start"" button, so it was unclear to me when the food would be available. After setting the unit up, i waited a couple hours for the unit to turn, and it never happened. the first section is always showing, so you have to leave it empty or have food available immediately.My mother bought one of these for her outdoor cats, and a groundhog completely destroyed it in one day. So it's not rodent proof either."
5,Excellent Easy to Use Guide,"This book traces the history of different types of feminism. It is well organized, well-written. It is an investment. The only problem of the book is the size of the book. I recomment buying the 2008 edition because you will deal with one book rather than two. The book is worth every penny. Go for it."
3,comprehensive yes but a little dry,"comprehensive yes it was. but mostly it was very boring. it was required for my philosophy and gender class, and it was torture for most of us to read. we enjoyed the primary source documents far more. who wouldnt? bottom line, this is a text book. know that you are buying a text book. a good one, yes but this will not be your pleasure reading on sundays."
4,Holocaust Victims,"This is a good basic book, It was published in 1995. Many sources, not know then are avaialble in 2011 to search maerial.ETRDenver"
5,The moon follows a little girl to Grandma's!,"When a little girl learns that she is going on a trip to visit her Grandmother, she gathers everything that she loves and packs the car full. Some of her prized possessions consist of a a tattered ragdoll, a fishing rod, a ball and bat, and ""hats! hats! I'll need two or three!"". When she arrives at her Grandmothers, she remarks ""Grandma,look up! The moon came too!"" This little girl will appeal to many young readers and listeners because of her many interests. She is a high-energy individual, yet quietly reads her favorite books with a flashlight in the car. She is a little tom-boy who fishes and gets muddy, yet likes to dress up in a girly bonnet. Some of her companions are her pet cat and her stuffed bunny doll - and of course, she adores her Grandma! The ""Moon Came Too"" is a cleverly written story and has an enjoyable rhyme and rhythm!"
4,A fun book about going to Grandma's house,"A little girl takes almost everything she owns with her to Grandma's house. ""An owl that hoots and a horn that toots, maybe one puzzle will do."" She brings almost everything imaginable. At the end, she realizes that even the moon came with her to Grandma's house.The story lets kids know how fun it can be to go to Grandma's house, and how comforting it is to see the moon, just as she sees it at her own house.The illustrations are fun, showing Mom's car packed with ""stuff"" that the little girl has to bring to Grandma's."
3,Beautifully Designed But Lacking in Depth,"This book is a feast for the eyes and a pleasure to leaf through casually. Abundant colorful images whet the reader's decorating appetite while presenting examples of a number of styles of chandeliers.Were this the book's intended purpose it would be highly recommended. The authors, however, purport to provide an authoritative guide, and here Chandeliers falls short. Missing almost entirely is a discussion of historical designs, antiques, and the styling of formal and grand chandeliers. The authors' clear preference for the whimsical and casual decorative idiom skews the content of this lovely book and ultimately limits its usefulness."
2,"Fine for speedbag, Not good for Heavy bag use","These are ok for the speedbag, worthless for the heavy bag. Quality was fair - already had a stitch coming loss by the thumbs after one use."
4,Not bad at all,"So these are leather bag gloves. They are a bit heavy, and a bit tight in the fingers. There is plenty of room in the palm and wrist areas, however, for wraps.In short, these are quality gloves. There will, as will all leather items, be a break in period, but they cover and protect what needs to be covered and protected, and the tightness fades as the gloves break in.I do like the longer than normal fingers. The bar in the middle has it's uses, but it's mostly annoying. You can grip it, but I'd rather an empty palm.All in all, a serviceable pair of gloves."
1,cheapo producto!,i was sent one used and one new glove so i returned them. they are not as heavy duty as the others out there.
4,Good for the price,"I agree (sort of) with prior criticism of the stiffness of the gloves. When I first put them on, one of the seams broke and the blood stopped flowing to a couple of my fingers (white fingers sticking out of the glove just looks wrong). However, it's about what I expected. I worked the gloves with a bit of Leather Honey, stitched up the seam, and now I couldn't be happier with the gloves (though a MMA fighter I'm not). I guess if you want professional grade gloves right out of the box, pay the price. For me, these are just right."
5,Great Bag & Grappling Gloves,"These are a Great pair of gloves for punching bag, speed bag and Grappling the fingers are long enough they cover the second knuckle as well which in my opinion is hard to find i have not lost any skin using these gloves on a punching bag which i would with other open finger gloves cause they don't cover the the 2nd knuckle all the way this is a great buy"
2,XXL gloves not true to size,"I bought these XXL leather bag gloves for my son who wears 2X and 3X size clothes, and has a hand approximately 5-1/4"" wide from thumb joint to palm. The right glove split down the side after the first couple of punches on the bag. He's still using the gloves, but they're duct-taped. It might help if the manufacturer supplied dimensions for the gloves, or the vendor supplied a chart or visual info to help customers determine sizing. These are the only XXL bag gloves at this price point, but unfortunately they seem to run smaller than one would expect, and the leather material is subject to splitting under the extremely tight fit. If your hands are a true XXL, you may find them too tight for comfort."
4,Before there was Bertie,"The first half of this book contains the first Jeeves tales, as they appeared in periodicals. If you've read 'Carry on Jeeves,' there's a lot of overlap here, although the style was polished up a bit later. The second half features Reggie Pepper, Bertie's prototype. His stories are entertaining in their own right, although they can't hold a candle to later Wodehouse. Still, it's interesting to see the evolution."
5,Amazing insights gained,This book combined with the hermeneutics class at Covenant Training Institute has significantly increased my ability to understand God's word!
4,Great suggestions,It is always problematic taking on change endeavours. You spend lots of time and money making the change only to have behaviours revert. This book provides concrete examples of how to keep you change in place. It was very helpful.
3,Shoes are NOT true to size,"Shoe arrived quickly, unfortunately, these ""Bandolino's"" are NOT true to size. I own 3 other pair of Bandolino (purchased from Nordstrom), and all are 7.5 (my actual shoe size). Ordered these as well in a 7.5, shoes are a full size too small, and very narrow (not a true ""B"" as well). Beautiful shoe, unfortunately they don't fit."
1,unreliable,"Great little frige. Good size and keeps everything cold. Only one thing, it stops working after one and a half months!"
2,Not what I was looking for...,"I would hoping this magazine would be something helpful to us ""average"" working mothers (read: not high-ups in a big corporation). I would love to read articles on time management, handling guilt, finding a good daycare, etc. Instead, this magazine prints lots of articles on what other companies are doing that's great for working moms (good for them, what does that help me?) and profiles women who make 6-figure salaries while raising kids. I'm sure there's a target audience out there who like this magazine, but it sure isn't me. Let me emphasize, too, that I'm not the mom who hates her job but works to put foot on the table. I like my job and choose to work, but I just don't find this magazine helpful or interesting at all. Highly disappointing."
1,Not Useful At All,"I've read the past 6 or 7 issues of this magazine because they subscribe to it at the office where I work. It's definitely not worth paying for.They LOVE to highlight corporations who are helping working mothers and it often comes across as just free publicity for these companies. It's great that these companies are supporting working women, but not all of us working moms work there, so what's the point?They also spend time each magazine highlighting certain working moms, but personally, I've never been able to relate to the women they highlight. Another reviewer commented that it's women making 6 figures, and I highly doubt that's the average American working mom. I guess this magazine is targeted to a specific type of audience, that just doesn't include me.Skip this one and stick with the other parenting magazines for more useful info. This one just doesn't have all that much for the average working mom."
1,Only targets executives,"This magazine doesn't have anything useful for the majority of working mothers. Whether you're working for minimum wage, or you're in a professional field, it doesn't matter, this magazine is not aimed at you. If you're not the CEO of Kraft Foods, I wouldn't recommend this magazine to you."
5,Just what I needed.,"I subscribed to this magazine on a whim, and am happy to receive a copy each month. There is great information in here for working moms, and the additional information on the magazine website is also very helpful. The only draw back, is that I wish they produced 2 a month :)"
2,Buyer Beware,The book is good at pointing the seller in the right directions. Theauthor is causious at not going to far in giving too much advice whichcauses the reader to have to do more homework. I felt it gave me morequestions than answers. I felt overwhelmed by all the steps and whereto go to accomplish the task at hand.
5,Wow !! Stable and Accessible,Neat accessory for the ipod in the car! (See custom photos for idea). Keeps the ipod easily reachable and stable to work with. Tilt angle ensures readability fron mutiple positions. Different sized cups ensures it to fit all cars (tried it a couple). Works good as a stand in home also.Overall for the price its a very good buy!!
2,Doesn't fit 03 Envoy,"I was so excited to get this for my iPod. I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy. There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit. If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box."
3,Won't fit all cars,"Things will vary depending on what car you have. I have a '99 Honda Accord, and this product does not fit snugly into the cup holder. It is stable enough to hold the iPod without falling over though, and I haven't found any better option."
2,Don't buy this if you have a Classic in a case,"I think this is a great product...as long as you're using anything other than an iPod Classic in a hard case. I have a 120gb classic with a plastic case (made by Belkin, ironically). The case barely adds any width to the iPod at all, but it's just enough where it doesn't fit, and it feels like the sides are going to snap off. Renders the suction cup virtually useless as well. All they had to do was add a feature where the width could be adjusted...or at least make rubber sides instead of hard plastic. If you don't have a Classic, or don't mind taking your Classic out of your case every time you want to listen to music in the car, this is a good product."
3,"Useful, but not perfect","I bought the Belkin TuneDok a few weeks ago in preparation for a long vacation road trip with my iPod. I also purchased the iCarPlay from Monster Cable. I have a 2005 suburban and although the TuneDok comes with several ""cups"" none fit very securely in the cup holder. The TuneDok did hold the iPod securely and the adjustable stand was easy to set so that I could see to operate my iPod. Since the cup wasn't held very securely by the cup holder, it was a bit difficult to operate the touch wheel. All in all, the TuneDok is a great idea but the lack of a secure fit in the cup holder makes it less than perfect."
5,Fits nicely into the cup holder,"One thing to keep in mind, however, is that in certain cars, the cup holders are right next to each other. This would render your other cupholder unusable just like you can't put anything in the second cupholder if you fit in super-size drink. Having said that, it fits right and the inclination adjusts great."
3,A Simple Solution,"After researching various solutions for using my iPOD in my vehicle, this product seems to be the simplest. So far I am pleased, however I feel like after time, the suction cup that holds the iPOD in place will deteriorate. Also, the ""cup"" part that goes in your cup holder was almost too small for my Jeep Wrangler. Another concern is that my vehicle has very stiff suspension and I'm sure if I hit a big enough pot hole or if I was on a dirt road that the iPOD would go flying out.However for most vehicles on the road, this is a simple and affordable way to manage your iPOD."
2,Not That Great,"Alerts thieves that there could be an i-pod in the car. It will of course not fit if you protect your i-pod with a skin or protector. Since it sits low in my cup tray in my vehicle I cannot see the display to toggle with the menu. I have to remove it from the holder to change songs, playlist etc."
2,Product Good- Description Bad,"""Innovative AirGrip technology holds your iPod to your car dash/cup holder"" Oops, AirGrip holds the iPod, it does _not_ attach to car dash. I'm sure that it would be jim-dandy if I had a center cup holder..."
1,Does not work for Zen products,"I bought this to us with my wife's Zen in our Volvo sedan. We could not make it work. I tried to give to one of my kids, who all have Ipods. None wanted it. I should have sent it back, but the various parts got distributed around and individually tossed."
3,just ok,it worked well in my Maxima. i now have Murano and these cups just don't fit properly in the cup holder.very specific to the car.
3,"Not 100% satisfied, but gets the job done.","I own a Infiniti G35 Coupe. I was looking for a Cup holder cradle for my iPhone 3G.1. The cradle is a tight fit for the iPhone if you have a iPhone case.2. If you are going to be removing the device from the car often, you are gonna want to remove the suction cup that's attached to the cradle.3. I don't know if it's just my car but i haven't had a chance to test it with other car cup holders. It fits fine but if you try and put any other type of bottle/cup right next to it. It either doesn't fit or its very tight. It's very annoying at times. I'm sure the cup holders are wider is larger in vehicles like sedans and SUV's.Overall the product is decent.I'd recommend it to someone but i'd double check their cup holder setup."
2,Not for iPhone as advertised by other vendors.. a tight fit..,"Specification on iPod and iPhone are very similar in terms of the dimension.I purchased this thinking that it will fit iPhone 3G, while it does fit with the naked iPhone, if you have any type of case on it, it will NOT fit.I exacerbated the crack on my iPhone case using this dock. It puts stress on the iPhone case, I don't recommend it for iPhone."
4,Wow!!,"For the price... 5 stars (I'd give 10 stars if possible). For the fit... 5 stars. For the functionality... 5 stars. My only regret is not having it in black. Seriously, I've played with a couple of fit options and I'm completely satisfied with my choice. I use it with a Monster FM transmitter/charger and I have no problems with port accessibility. The suction mount is really sturdy and simple to use. Just keep in mind, the fact that I don't use a case on my iPod."
2,"Works in Theory, but not well in practice","I purchased this for my Toyota truck and my 20 gig iPod. SURPRISE! The dock doesn't fit if you have your iPod in a case--iSkin, or other one. Hmmmm. Have to remove it from its protective case to use this? Put the base in the cupholder. SURPRISE! It isn't deep enough to bottom out and hold the iPod steady, once I remove it from the case. So, I have a wobbly holder that holds my iPod in place--sort of--once I take 5 minutes to remove the case.Thank you, not. Save your money and buy some songs from iTunes."
4,"Very good, but check your cup holder first.","This is a great product, but sometimes when you put it in some cup holders, the weight of the ipod will tumble it. Is better when your cup holder is like a ring and not a hole."
2,Not great,Takes up a cup holder sometimes phone falls out can't use some plugs due to frame blocking port can't angle phone the way you want wouldn't buy again
3,It's Alright...,The design is great and simple and everything I just wish it was able to rotate to display the phone horizontally as well.
2,too many pieces,"this item could be easy to use, and really, it's not rocket science. However, so many pieces are included to make sure it will fit your individual cup holder that it becomes redundant. There are three different cup sizes and a rubber sleeve, I suppose to slip over any cup that's still too small. I cannot believe that there is this much fine tuned variation in cup holders (a matter of millimeters of difference in the provided cups.) When you find the ultimate one to fit you are left with all these pieces that are obsolete.And then the important part, that holds the iPod is entirely unadjustable. One size fits all? I thought there was more difference in iPod and other brands of music player sizes than there was in cup holders.The nice thing about it is that there are no fixed parts that you have to screw on to your car or stick on with that white foam tape that never really comes off.All around, it's a strange design."
5,Great for MP3 Players other than the iPod,I love this product! It is easy to use and it fits both my older style Zune as well as my husband's newer and smaller sized HD Zune! Holds my player securely at an adjustable angle so it is viewable without me having to take my eyes off the road.
5,True Gospel Music,"I love the Gospel Songs of old.. We need more of these types of songs in Gospel music..LOVE IT, LOVE IT!"
1,Deceptively small,"I purchased this set for my daughter's 4th birthday tea party thinking it would be cute and usable for her party. Well it is cute, but definitely not usable. It was soooo tiny that you would be lucky to get a sip of tea in the cup or a piece of valentine heart candy on the plate. I expected a miniature tea set but not a microscopic one. This set would only be good for serious pretend play for a child 2 or younger, even a three year would probably want something a little larger."
4,Not a bad product,"I was skeptical to buy this after reading the reviews, but it was the only product I found that did what I needed. I needed a two dish feeder where both compartments would open at the same time, and this was the only one I could find.The instructions are not helpful at all and it might be a little light-weight for medium or large dogs, but it's perfect for my needs and it's always worked properly."
1,Does not work,"This product never worked. When I tried to manually open it, the right side did not open properly, and would fall down, which could hit your pet in the head, if it worked at all. I set it and it never opened for several days. Don't buy this product."
1,Broken,Lid broken upon arrival. Tried to fix with duct tape to check it out. Fussy to set up with switches in three different places w hard to read labels. No feedback whether the timer is actually worked. Decided to shop for a different brand.
1,Inoperable,"Brand new batteries and this product worked for about 20 minutes, then never worked again...even with a fresh set of new batteries. Repeat: this item did not work at all."
3,Antique and obsolete music styles,"If you want to play like people did in 16th century France or Italy,this book might be useful, but to thehip-hop or rock performer of today it is clearly of no real use.As to jazz performance arts it has nothing to say to the performer.So if you are interested in historical or classical music, this book might help you understandold scores and how to use them,but since most don't get paid for playing pretty much dead music,it is an out of date music book that even classical players really don't need."
5,"Eerie, compelling, and fascinating","I picked up this book on a reccomendation, and read it in one night, literally unable to put it down. The book is marvelous - full of unusual and vivid imagery and well drawn out characters that draw you into this alternate Earth. The author has a knack for tiny touches that add huge amounts of detail to the overall story. A fantastic book, in every sense of the word."
2,Shallow read,"If plot is important to you, look elsewhere. While the novel is fairly well written, nothing really happens in it. Its setting is a world like our own except that magic has returned. Unfortunately, this point is kept WAY in the background. In fact, there's very little brought forth in this novel. Characters are never really developed, settings are colorless, and -- again -- plot is very shallow. Like a splash of water on the countertop shallow. I'm not certain how this received a ""notable book"" award, or if that award is really as prestigious as it sounds. That said, Stewart isn't a bad writer; it's just not a very good story. Maybe his newer books (like Galveston) are better."
2,Pet Chime,"In December 2002, I purchased the pet chime and paw & two additional paws. I was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks. In the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by Lentek. They're great, IF THEY WORK!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Worked once from 1 foot away. Did not work from 15' away. Then stopped working altogether. Here's what I did:(1) Returned it.(2) Went to hardware store, got a wireless doorbell button and chime for half the price, which DID work from 15' away.(3) Mounted button on back door, taped a paper plate over it.(4) Now training pooch to just nudge the plate with her nose."
2,OK not great,The paw works but the quality is very low. It is made out of cheap plastic and I found paper stuck inside. The bell rings randomly as others have noted. The random ringing happens if the button gets stuck down. It doesn't always pop back up after it is pushed. It isn't even waterresistent for those thinking of putting it outside.The intercom part works fine and seems to be of decent quality. The barking option is just irritating though.
2,"Great idea, poor reliability","This pet chime was a good idea, but I am sending it back. Sometimes the chime won't ring and at other times it rings on its own and worst of all it starts ringing and won't stop. Clearly the manufacturer needs to work on quality control."
3,Nice product but stopped working right after three weeks,"My friend owns a similar product and it works great. The dog hits it every time he needs to go potty. Mine, however started going off at random and was super annoying. So I'm thinking of buying a different kind of doggy doorbell."
4,Ordering more though its not perfect,I've used the pet chime for a couple years. It's great but it's not perfect. Sometimes the paws stop working and you have to shake them.They are also sensitive to moisture and freezing. Mine never get wet but they stil have a problem with the weather. The one problem I have is how do you tell your dog you can only ring the bell if you need to go to the bathroom. Not just because you want to check out the front yard for a minute and come right back in. :)
1,"Good at first; after 1 month, it BARKS constantly","I thought this was just great for the first month. But after a couple rain storms, as others have said, the PAW sticks and it's unreliable. It will continue to BARK OR RING, depending on how you've set it, CONSTANTLY. I've thrown my out; it was way too annoying."
1,"Cute concept, but buyer remorse","I had this less than 2 days and the button on the paw pad would stick causing it to chime over and over until the button is pushed again. Then it started to randomly chime by itself. Thinking it was the batteries, I added fresh new ones, but the problem still exists. Since it continued waking me in the middle of the night I have discontinued using and it's been less than 3 weeks since I purchased."
3,Alternative to Pet Doorbell,"I don't mean to deprive anyone of his or her right of consumerism. However, I wanted to share my idea for a ""pet doorbell."" A wind chime. I hung a small wind chime similar to this:Woodstock Temple Bells Trio , Copperunder my kitchen counter next to the back door. I ring it when it's time to go to work so my dog knows it's time to go outside. And my dog rings it when she wants to ""do her business.""I think using a wind chime for a pet doorbell is great for several reasons. It requires no batteries. Wind chimes make a pleasant sound no matter how many times you hear it. Your dog can also convey their urgency. My dog usually lightly nudges it and if I am in another room or take too long, she will then nudge the chime so it is noticeably louder."
1,worthless.,"worthless piece of junk. Never worked properly. Didn't work most of the time, kept getting stuck when it did. We finally threw it in the trash."
2,"Worked great for 2 weeks, then broke","Worked great for 2 weeks, dog easily used it, perfect, no problem. Then suddenly the paw started to be inconsistent, then stopped altogether. Tried new batteries, adjusting etc. Nope its done. I'm not gonna bother to return based on other posters comments. I will go back to using a ""human"" wireless doorbell from the hardware store. Those do work better but the concern is that the battery compartment is a pop open, unlike the paw which screws shut. If the dog pops open the doorbell and eats the battery, yikes! So, I am hoping like others someone will build a better doorbell. If the paw had worked it would have been great, but the quality is just too low."
3,Returned smoothy.,"Not satisfied at all, was chiming constantly for no reason, and then did not chime when puppy was pressing the paw... gave 3 stars, the return process was easy and understanding. Maybe was a defective item? ..."
2,"Rings randomly, basically usesless.","For the first several weeks, after my dog figured out how to use this product it was great. Unfortunately, after about 2 months it started acting up, where the receiver would chime at random times. As you can imagine this was quite annoying, and essentially made the device useless.I don't recommend it."
1,Faulty Product,"We really liked the idea of the product, and when we first set it up, it seemed promising. After having it less than a month, the button randomly sticks and starts ""barking"" randomly throughout the day. Of course, this completely confuses the dog and makes it a useless teaching tool."
1,Does not work more than 1 foot away,I just got this from Amazon - working on returning there is no range between the PAW and doorbell chime. Even at 2 - 3 feet away with brand new batteries it seems to have issues. I thought it would be more usable than a hanging bell and easier to install with less holes and hardware. The PAW is more like a toy so you have to mount it and since there is no range u have to mount the reciever directly above it. With the range of the one I have it would of made sense to combine the two.
1,"Wireless range poor, volume too low","I read the mixed reviews but went ahead and purchased this item to give our labradoodle an alternative to scratching at the door. The wireless paw did not work further than 16 inches from the receiver. This prevents you from placing the paw outside and the receiver inside, or even from putting the chime on a table with the paw on the floor. The volume on the chime is so low that it's less audible than my dog scratching outside. Very disappointing."
3,Great idea to keep pets from scratching at the door!!,"This idea is great. The kids love it and it amuses many. The presentation is a little cheesy and less than refined but, this can be enjoyed because of the practicality of it.The transmitter -> receiver reception has a little to be desired. The product says that they can be 100 ft apart. If ours is more than 10 feet apart it doesn't work ( no chime). If the transmitter/receiver are around a corner/outside a door/or too far apart (10 ft) this system didn't work for us. We thought of returning it but then found a work around where we placed the chime next to the door (since it is loud enough to be heard throughout) and the paw at the door. In this set up, we can put the paw outside so that our pooch can tell us she needs to come inside without scratching. Thank you for that!!"
3,Pet Chime,"The pet chime has worked very well with our new beagle puppy. However, it sometimes chimes by itself."
4,The best present,"I got my husband this and a brand new state-of-the-art camcorder for Christmas. He said this was his best present in years. It's saving our front door from the dog scratching to get in. OK, the naysayers are right; it did go off on its own once in a while in the first couple of weeks. But we'd shake it a bit and then it would be fine. It no longer is a problem. Yeah, it feels a bit cheesy; I doubt it will last forever, but there's nothing else like it on the market. A word of warning, follow the instructions for training your dog. Our dog has always picked things up super fast so I thought we didn't need to follow the training guidelines; it took several days before he got it. Anyway, we're quite happy."
5,Doggy Doorbell,"THIS is a great product! It can be used indoors, to let owners know their dog(s) want to go outside ..... or mounted in a dry, secure place outdoors, to allow the dog(s) to signal when they want to come back in from their fenced back-yard. It's pretty easy to teach the dog to hit the ""keypad"" with his nose, and the dog loves the fact that he can come back indoors when he wants .... instead of hyaving to wait till his owner gets around to it!"
3,"Cute Design For Parents, Not Puppies","The pet chime was definitely designed with the parents of puppies in mind, and not the puppies themselves. My husband and I liked the idea of the puppy monitor and a cute paw to hang on the door. My puppy, however, wanted nothing to do with stepping on this paw or pushing her nose against it. It simply was not intriguing to her. We have recently switched to simple, standard bells which she loves to nose and play with, and consequently has made potty training much easier."
2,Good luck,"After seeing a video of a pug using this doorbell to get out I thought it would be a great way to train our pug to let us know he had to go out. We attempted training him on it for a good 3 months before accepting that he just wasn't going to get it. It didn't work for dog, but that doesn't mean it can't work for yours. In theory, this is a great idea, but I think it just needs the right dog.L"
1,Does not work,"This product does not work, your dog will pee on the carpet waiting for you to open the door. It only rings about 50% of the time buttom is pushed even with the receiver 5ft away. A piece of junk made in China. I am sending mine back for a refund."
2,Good idea but hard to execute....,"I got this product because my dog was trained to ring bells hanging from the front door but I couldn't always hear them depending where I was in the house. This seemed like the perfect solution! It is a good volume and easy to use but I've had a very hard time getting the dog to ring it before she goes outside!! The bells she recognized that she was creating the sound, but the door chime is in another part of the house and she doesn't seem to realize that she is making the sound when she steps on the paw... I also have trouble with my cat laying on it when he's looking out the window by the front door and it going off constantly until I go and shoo him away!"
3,Works as long as Mom does it for me,"Great concept item; unfortunately my puppy did not adapt to the concept of pushing the button to go outside. However, she is now trained to run to the door any time she hears a doorbell ring (even on t.v.) Cute, but didn't accomplish what we wanted it to. It was returned."
1,Waste of money and time,"I've spent hours trying to teach my Pug to press the button; I started trying to teach him when he was a puppy. Even the dog trainers have tried. We've tried rubbing it with meat and peanut butter. I've tried pressing it every time I we go outside. He still only tells me he wants to go out by standing by the door and staring at me, which is not good if I'm asleep in the other room."
3,"Good, not great","I had read that this was a GREAT book, and it certainly never achieves that.It is workmanlike, competant, and sometimes even excellent, but Ms. Wesson has a habit of trying to throw in everything, including the kitchen sink, when simpler would be better. I thought the ending was fine, and I liked Cinda pretty well. But certain scenes just went on and on, and therewas a lot of repetetiveness. Still and all, enjoyable if you're not expecting the second coming."
4,A Great Legal Thriller Has Been Created <G>,"I make my living as a criminal defense attorney. I'm about 80 pages into a book written by my friend Marianne Wesson. Based on the first 80 pages, I feel like Kathleen Bates in ""Misery"" after reading the first 80 pages of ""Misery."" The significant difference is that after finishing this one, I seriously doubt that murdering the authoress will be my agenda. (You do know that is a joke, right?) This reads as well as (better than?) the usual (which I LOVE) Grishams and and Turows (which I also LOVE). I know that ""bettern than"" is a bold statement, but trust me, this one rings real. The people are real. I know, because I do this stuff every day. The realism of the struggles works because it IS real. This is a keeper. I can't wait to get my autographed (it was that way in the store) signed again by Mimi!"
4,"A Terrific New Writer, A Little Disappointed with Ending","I thoroughly enjoyed reading the advance copy I have of this book. The novel is extremely well-paced and well-written. The book clearly was not written in a rush. Wesson continually sets up amusing, involving, suspenseful scenes. I was disappointed with the ending because it was far-fetched and, I think, implausible. There were some loose ends regarding the solution that weren't tied up and that was disappointing, but up to then the book was uncommonly well-writen and entertaining."
3,"Good, but no Grisham","I'll admit I had a bit of trouble getting into this; in fact, it took me three tries. However, the third time was a charm and by page 53, I was hooked and stayed up way too late to finish it. I'm not a lawyer, and I think some of the legal detail is what slowed me down. I really liked the character of Cinda. I did have to remind myself the story is set in 1990/1991 and being very liberal, one of the major plot points seemed a non-issue to me, but I know that not true even today. The story builds well and the ending is effective, even though I guessed it. Overall, I though it was good and will read the next, because it's already on my shelf, but I'm not certain I'd have sought it out otherwise. Think I'll stick to Grisham."
2,"On closer examination, not as well written as you may think.","Marianne Wesson seems to use this novel as a vehicle to advance her liberal feminist agenda. She seems to take great effort to make none of her central characters seem like mainstream Americans. I also take exception to her portrayal of Christians and stay-at-home moms as a bunch of materialistic hypocrits. The central theme is not new, and her ""unique"" ending doesn't jive with the facts as she lays them out. The novel should have been subjected to more thorough fact checking before publication. She can't even get the date of Nicole's disappearance straight throughout the book - it varies from one Saturday in August (Jason's version) to the weekend AFTER Labor Day (Nicole's father's version). All in all, I don't believe this book is worthy of a glowing recommendation."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"The characters are paper-thin, and are comically stereotyped; shaped by the author's knee-jerk liberal feminist outlook. Thus, every white male is a pig, a lout or a rapist, the black male love interest spouts a lot of phony jive dialog, and the female characters are strong, hip and wise - even the villain. None of the characters talks like any real person ever did. If the characters don't annoy you, the plot will. It proceeds at a snail pace through every predictable turn of this type of law novel. The ""surprise"" ending is telegraphed to all midway through the book. It's a bomb. My advice: stick with Scott Turow, and hope that Mimi Wesson does a better job on her next book."
4,"Drop it, if you dare.","Render Up the Body revels in its simplicity.Lucinda Hayes is a former prosecutor, who forsakes her job as the director of a rape crisis center to represent a death row inmate, Jason Smiley, in his appeal.Marianne Wesson's legal experience serves as an anchor for the book, but her crisp writing is a delight. Cinda Hayes comes across as a lady with issues; Jason Smiley as a murderer who'll grasp at any straw to escape execution. The plot is simple, which means it accomodates complex legal ideas easily, and the end carries the stinger.Lovers of legal thrillers and good writing should have one command: Render up this novel."
4,Good Read,"Well written legal mystery with excellent charactors. Not really a mystery or thriller yet it was the kind of book that was interesting in the way of how the legal system works in terms of trying to get a conviction overturned when the person has already been sentenced to die by lethal injection. Very suprising ending. Easy to follow, interesting to read."
4,Nice strap but hard to put on,I had to take this to a jeweler to put on for me but certainly love the result. It gets dirty very easily though - I wish I'd thought to treat with some leather polish before wearing.
5,This doll is perfect,Layla is so awsome!!!!!!!!! I am tring to get Stella but Layla is cool but the only problem is that her outfit is hard to put on and the plastic straps break easly bit other than that she is cool. Any way they are more durable than barbie and more for 9-13 year olds. I reccomend for any age
5,This Movie Needs To Be Made,"Mr Tobin reconstructs masterfully the events leading to Kitty Hawk, and then carries on to about 1910 in the same style.My own specialized knowledge was increased. As a career meteorologist with the National Weather Service I made a good living doing aviation weather. I have long known that Kitty Hawk was chosen for its wind conditions AND that it was chosen thanks to the remarks of a government weather man who first brought the site to Wilbur's attention in a letter. Now I also know the man's name. Bravo! Mr Tobin.Someone could make a great movie of all this, lots of CGI. For now I am searching for a copy of ""Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines."""
1,Just don't read it,"While I am a keen reader, I am no literary expert. Ordinarily I would not write a book review of any sort. However, I felt compelled to make an exception in the case of ""To Conquer the Air"". Despite my enthusiasm for the subject matter, I found Tobin's style insufferably painful. He is more interested in tangential minutiae than in telling the story. For instance, he uses a single paragraph spanning almost half a page to itemize the contents of McClure's magazine simply to introduce an irrelevant character by the name of Professor Newcomb (p.117). He regularly snatches boredom from the jaws of curiosity with vignettes about the petty struggles between Bishop Wright (Wilbur and Orville's father) and breakaway factions within his church. How an author can mix ingredients like rivalry, deceit, visionary brilliance, and momentous discovery into such a disagreeable literary cocktail is beyond me."
3,Good Family Film,"This is a good family movie with a wonderful Christian message that there is life after death. The acting in this movie in my opinion is very amateurish. But when the younger brother ""meets"" his brother who had recently died in a car accident, tugs at the heart strings. I heartily recommend this movie."
3,"Mantras, the hippie way","I was dissapointed with the album. The music was ordinary and reminded me of the ""kunbaya""-type of songs from the 60's.... Don't know id they invoke magical healing, but the mantras are rather a cheap boring version of commercialized hippie music.I am used to listening to true mantras from the masters, and I don't recall any of them being so superficial."
5,Incredible,I heard this cd in a yoga class recently and it touched me like none other. Enchanting was a word that was used in one of the reviews and I could note agree more.
2,Replacement parts,While it was working it was a great product. When the power supply went out I could never get a replacement.
1,Nikon FF-CP10 NC neutral color (NC) filter,"I received the Nikon FF-CP10 CPL Circular Polaarizing Filter and the Nikon FF-CP10 ND$ neutral densiity (ND) filter, BUT I NEVER received the Nikon FF-CP10 NC neutral color (NC) filter. When can I expect delivery on this filter???????????????????????????????"
4,Fantastic opening sentence,"First, I read some of the reviews and mostly they liked the book, and especially the opening line. Not all were so positive about the rest of the book so I'll just politely disagree. I thought the book lived up to the opening line and did an excellent job of setting up the series with Tremaine et all the characters. M.Wells does an excellent job of developing the characters and as I'm reading book two of this series, she continues doing so in it as well. I grew up reading Andre Norton (and loved her books even now as a Sr. adult) and M.Wells is doing an excellent job of writing with a distinctly more mature feel. If you like SyFy this is an excellent writer to read, and this book was very good."
3,Underwhelming,"The Wizard Hunters underwhelmed me. It is competently written and features at least two well-drawn characters, but the storyline and writing did not engage me. The pacing felt imbalanced: slow at the start, quick in the middle, and then almost too fast at the end. The writing seemed dispassionate to me, as if the author were reporting events instead of showing them. To be fair, I credit the author with creating intelligent characters. In other novels, I often know things before the characters do; in this novel, Tremaine came to conclusions around the same time I did. I read a lot of fantasy and do not consider The Wizard Hunters a great achievement; however, I will read another Martha Wells' novel to see if my average opinion of this novel is warranted."
4,Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River,"For a NON white water person the book describes the adrenaline addiction, self challenges, skills necessary to tackle the Tsangpo River, probably the most dangerous and inaccesible river in the world. It describes the physical challenges, political and cultural differences of sherpas and carriers. It describes the kyakers intrusion into sacred territory and the needless aggression of China over Tibet's indigenous people. Insight into high-achievers, and an unseen part of the world."
3,"Disappointed, Confused","After reading many adventure stories in the past few years, this was the least satisfying. The whitewater descriptions were not clear enough for the uninitiated to appreciate and understand. The two included maps were not very helpful either. Photographs would have helped. Although the paddlers were risking their lives amost every day, I never got involved with them enough to care. In the end I felt sorry for the author who himself endured so much pain but was restricted by the paddlers from using all means of communicating the story."
1,This book does not deliver the action that it calls for.,"I just finished this book and was overall disappointed in how Peter portrays this historic feat. First of all, he is not kayaking the Tsangpo. Rather, he relays on the kayakers for their point of view. To make matters worst, the kayakers don't like him (as he states often in the book), b/c they believe he is there to exploit them (which he is). Instead of telling of their trek, he tells his story of being on the ground. He doesn't even follow the kayakers, like his coworker Charlie, who works as a photographer. Plus, there are zero pictures.I would have more respect for this book, if he actually kayaked the river. It is just not the same. Also, this is his first book and he has trouble keeping a train of thought. Often, he jumps from story to story which leaves me confused and wanting more. He does not create good imagery, either. Overall, skip this book, unless you want to hear about how to trek, not kayak, the Tsangpo Gorge."
2,Never seems to find equilibrium,"After finishing 'High Crimes' I wanted to be transported back to the Himalayas. 'Hell or High Water' called my curiosity and so I embarked on it. I should say that white water kayaking isn't as appealing as high mountain climbing. There is something to be said about going up as opposed to floating down that makes one feel excited.'Hell or High Water' never seems to find equilibrium, something to build upon and expand. The descriptions of the landscape are plain, almost unimaginative. The story is simple, not in its totality, but in its mundaneness.I don't recommend it."
2,"Disappointing read, no great enlightened ending","I enjoy well written memoirs. My expectations were high. I was hoping that the writer himself would end up on the water for a little bit. Although I'm an open water kayaker, I was not familiar with the white water kayaking terms. Heller used words such as holes, which would have been helpful to have a little more description. The transition between events portrayed was awkward.The writer kept saying he was on a spiritual journey to find his soul. Well there was much ado about nothing. Did he ever have an epiphany? The ending was unceremonious and I found myself scanning just to finish the book.However there were good moments in the book, just not enough worth to read."
2,Just not that good,"Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking. No photos. It hurts the book."
1,Very Disappointing,"This video will not give you the type of quality 60s footage you are looking for, just tired philosophic musings from fairly boring people."
3,"I remember Peter Coyote was in it, and that's it","Okay, I bought this like a year ago. I was very excited about it, but now, dont remember much. Oh, I think this is the one where they tell a story about making one of the Monkees give them a bunch of money so they can go buy the land for the commune. They broke into his house and scared him! Also, I remember one of the daughters not seeming very happy about her lack of normalcy and lack of privacy."
4,Great Memories Preserved,The DVD is very good quality and gives an amazing look at the 1960's. What's fun is the people in the '60's movie were on hand to give a personal view of them then and now. Very inciteful if you like the 1960's culture.
5,FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"17 BRAND NEW TRACKS!!!! SPICE 1 & MC EIHT, ALL THE WAY THROUGH....ONLY ONE FEATURE....PERFECT! 14 OF THE 17 TRACKS ARE ON FIRE, 3 OK TRACKS AND NO WEAK TRACKS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUM'S TO COME OUT OF THE WESTCOAST. BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY, THIS IS EASILY THE HOTTEST ""ALBUM OF THE YEAR"". BUYYY ITTT!!!! BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT ON CD! BELIEVE THAT!!!!!!"
5,Nuthin But Tha Gangstaz,"It's about time two of the best rappers alive today have joined together to do a whole album. Great disc definetly buy this c.d. worth every penny. Best tracks are "" We Run The Block"" and "" I Ain't Scared "" some of the songs are a little mellow but you cannot go wrong with these two on the same disc. I enjoyed every second of bumpin this in my ride."
3,"Lacks originality, but has a few good points","I purchased this CD after following ""recommended"" links from The Handsome Family via the Mekons (both of which are highly recommended). I read all these rave reviews about Kelly -- wondering now if they're based on hype, uneducated listening, narrow taste buds or a combination of the three. This isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. There are a few good songs. Kelly sounds a *lot* like Patsy Cline, occasionally a bit more hysterical than the original. The first cut actually made me cringe. I like her take on ""Papa was a Rodeo"" quite a lot but can't say it's worth the price of the CD. Oh well. Can't all be winners."
4,This year's Dusty in Memphis...,"Sassy country with a strong R&B underpinning, this album offers a good variety.Interesting choice of covers - Johnny Paycheck to lo-fi hero Stephen Merritt (Magnetic Fields).Kelly is an energetic singer - the backing band is loose and grooving.Fans of Neko Case, Dusty in Memphis, possibly even early Lone Justice, will enjoy this gem."
4,Great Voice Not Always Put to Best Use,"If heard a couple decades ago, this CD would pass muster as classic country with the originals built from the same throwback sound as the covers that make up the majority of the tracks. Production and playing are excellent, but, to my listening at least, Kelly Hogan's vocals are curiously passionless on some cuts. She is very strong on the raucous It's a Mighty Thin Line Between Love and Hate, Papa Was a Rodeo, Crackers Rule (perhaps the single best cut), and Whispering Pines. But in some of the other ballads (I Still Can't Believe You're Gone and her own Gone, for example) she sounds tentative, as if she's so concerned about going over the top that she checks her emotion at the studio door. And Wild Mountain Berries is just the cutesy kind of song that makes mainstream country such a tuneout now. Even with those criticisms, however, Beneath the Country Underdog is a strong CD."
1,Tomcat Angles,Super low budget. Screen play must of been writted by high school students.. I got the feeling the director got a deal on some cheap old flight films..
5,A variety of truly elegant food garnishes,"John Gargone's Food Art isn't for the quick cook who wants to produce garnishes in seconds: it's for the cook who wants a variety of truly elegant food garnishes to produce from scratch, from carved vegetable art to meat and vegetable displays and more. Yes, it's easy to do - but it won't be accomplished in seconds. FOOD ART's step-by-step color photos throughout provide exceptional embellishment on the techniques and fine art of carving and making garnishes."
1,UTTER WASTE OF MONEY,This is a very disappointing book. The garnishes are either overly elaborate and old-fashioned or suitable for a kindergarten class.As a professional caterer I can find nothing in this book that I will use.I also purchased Garnishing: A Feast for Your Eyes by Francis T. Lynch and this book is excellent. His chocolate roses are exquisite.
3,Food Art: Garnishing Made Easy,"The book was received in excellent condition. However, it was too advanced for the use of teaching a beginners class. I think it will be of use in our kitchen, but not as I had intended."
4,One of a kind performer,"As I listened to this album, I was transported to a Vegas lounge, and I could picture women throwing their panties onstage! You can't help but smile when Tom Jones launches into ""It's Not Unusual."" A great, quirky addition to any collection. And the album photo is quite something."
3,Bare chested Tom Jones,This is a very good cd but I was so spoiled with the Tom Jones' Reloaded Greatest Hits cd that this just doesn't do it for me quite as much. Don't get me wrong - it's Tom Jones and that great voice - but not quite as good as his newer cd that I bought.
5,Missing some other hits,"The Best of Tom Jones was released in March 30, 1998. This is classic Tom Jones singing his hits. Though most of them are on the cassette, some are missing like Delilah, Daughter of Darkness, and Letter to Lucille. [...], Tom Jones seems to have had more success in Ireland and the United Kingdom then in the United States. This is a great cassette to introduce Tom Jones to the public. Though I can go no higher than an A- because it is missing some other hits of Tom Jones.Side 1It's Not Unusual#10 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles-1965#3 U.S. Billboard Pop-Standard Singles#26 U.S. Billboard Hot Rhythm & Blues SinglesWhat's New Pussycat#13 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles-1965Georgia On My MindI'll Never Fall in Love Again#6 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles-1967#1 U.S. Billboard Easy ListeningDanny BoySide 2Detroit City#27 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles-1967Love Me Tonight#13 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles-1969#2 U.S. Billboard Easy ListeningRing of FireKansas CitySixteen Tons"
5,Get rid of Dumb Attitudes,"Wow - this book really helped to open my eyes about wrong expectations I had of my husband, and also in other relationships. I really appreciate the fact that both authors are Christians and have a true understanding of the drama that happens in marriages and has allowed the Holy Spirit to give them insight and then publish it. It has help to turn my marriage (other relationships too) around for the better. Like they write - the change starts with me. If I change, then the relationship changes too!"
5,A Honest Book on how to rebuild our marriages.,The author writes with great style and easy to read. A great step towards rebuilding your marriage and building each other up as God's workmanship.
4,Great Book!,"Not sure what book the person from Hilliard read, but this book is great!! Please, don't take someone elses word for it, read it yourself!"
1,Simply the worst.,Hotspot Networks by Daniel Minoli may simply be the worst book I have ever read. I just finished it and quite frankly I'm mad. I feel cheated. I don't know how this author managed to fill over 400 pages and say so very little about hotspots as I know them. Save your money and just read discussion list archives from the Wireless ISP list. You' ll actually learn something.
2,Don't All Religions Lead to God?,"This book implies that the reader will learn about other religions, but brings few facts or new information to the reader. The content is quite shallow. Our small group is quite disappointed in this selection and would not purchase another from this series."
2,kinda lame,"These 2 movies sucked, not worth buying. I like B movies done on a low budget but they gotta have a good story or good dialog. The sentinel & final days of earth get 2 stars, that's it not even a half star more."
1,Low budget junk,"Both films are derivative, nonsensecal, just plain stupid, and even look terrible. They are a complete waste of time and money. Amazon should be ashamed for selling this junk."
1,Belfonte Returns to Carnegie Hall,I received this CD damaged. The first few tracts will not play. The good part of the CD begins around tract #3.
2,Very little Belafonte,"Those purchasing this recording because they enjoyed Belafonte's wonderful first recorded concert at Carnegie will be disappointed. Only two or three songs are Belafonte solos, and the strength of those numbers are well below his standards set on the first one. Too much of this CD is taken up by his guests. A couple of those tracks are strong, but most are not memorable. This entire project tries too hard to be unique and hook us with cutesy, funny songs songs that aren't musically strong. One Example: Belafonte spends a couple of minutes introducing the ""most difficult"" song which, it turns out, consists of seven words, ""I wish the rent was heaven sent."" It is as weak musically as it is grammatically. Save your money on this one."
2,"Great songs, bad recording","I like the songs on this CD. Unfortunately the recording is poor. This is a live recording complete with audience. The recording of the songs is very quiet, while the sounds of the audience clapping is very loud. To listen to the album, you have to keep turning up the sound to hear the songs and turning down the sound after every song because of the loud clapping."
5,My dad had this when I was a kid,"If you're old enough to remember when everyone listened to folk music, you'll love this. If you're not old enough, listen to it and find out why you will like it"
5,LOVE LYNETTE HAWKINS STEPHENS,BE GRATEFUL I'M GOING AWAY HE'S THAT KIND OF FRIEND ARE LIKE BRAND NEW--AS IF IT WAS RECORDED 2002. WELL THE WHOLE ALBUM IS UPLIFTING.
5,RIP Walter!!,His death in July 2010 prompted this purchase and it brought backall the wonderful memories from my childhood. The music is timelessand a definite must have for all fans. God bless the Hawkins family!!
5,A Must Have,"This is an awesome cd. It lifted my spirit on so many different levels. No matter what you are going through, you can find spiritual lifting on this cd."
3,Not as close as people claim,"It may be that I'm still getting used to using a safety razor, but I don't feel it shaves as close as my old cheap blue target razors. That said you feel really cool and old fashioned shaving with one of these, so I'm going to keep using it."
5,I'm sold,"I was a bit spectacular about this razors. I looked at all reviews on amazon on all the razors and come to find out that the Merkur model is the best razor. I was getting tired of the buying new razor blades for my Gillette Fusion at a high price. So I figured I'll give the Merkur razor a try and order it a week ago. As it arrived I was a bit shock how small the device was. I tried the razor immediately and wow did I feel the difference between my Fusion and the Merkur.The only downside is that you have to patients with razor. You may cut yourself if your not careful with this classic razor, but its expected to take your time. I would highly recommend this or any Merkur model razor to anyone. If your still wondering about getting this, watch some videos on YouTube to see if its right for you."
5,best shave ever,"I love this razor super close shave, just have to be carful, don't apply pressure just let the weight of the razor do the job. Please at the office has stopped to ask me who do i get suck a clean shave. Give it a try you wont regret it. It also saves you money and is better for the environment."
5,very solid razor,"I've owned this razor for about a year now, and I'll never go back to the triple and quadruple bladed razors that are all over the place. First of all, I no longer get the razor burn and ingrown hairs that I used to get with my old razor. I used to shave as rarely as possible, because it was such a horrible process, but this, along with a shaving brush and soap, makes me not mind it at all. I am still lazy though, so I don't shave everyday. Which brings me to another advantage of this razor: if you put off shaving for too long, this razor doesn't pull out long hairs, like contemporary razors do, it cuts them off clean, which is a godsend for lazy people like me. The learning curve is not as big as other people seem to think, just make sure not to rush your way through the first few times you shave with it."
4,Nothing beats the Classics,"It's funny, but the older I got, the more retro I started getting; at least with shaving. Classic old time double edge blade razors like this one give a much better shave than the current trend of adding more and more blades to (expensive) replacement cartridges. The last time I bought a pack and finally realized they ran around $2 a cartridge I got out my grandfather's old double edge and found it gave just as good a shave. I decided to invest in the Merkur Classic (more finally crafted than grandpa's shaver) and have been extremely happy with the results. The initial cost may be more, but you will save money in the long run.Be sure to get good blades. Merkur's stainless steel blades work well. They are still 1/4 the price of the Mach 3."
2,"Beware - 1850 Edition, not 1805","I'm a grad student, and I purchased this due to its linked paperback 1805 edition. This kindle version, however, is the 1850 edition, not the 1805."
1,More music less congregation noise,"The ambient noises of the congregation totally distracts from the music. Can appreciate the joy and 'spirit' gospel music brings to a live audience, but on this CD, it is totally overwhelming . Compare this to the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir and it's like night and day. BTC allows you to hear and concentrate on the music, melody and harmony.. LA might want to consider doing more 'in studio' and less 'live' (or mixed) joyous noises."
3,Handy for Cereal,"I breastfeed but use Enfamil to mix with her baby cereal. It's handier (especially when out) plus I would rather have some formula go to waste than pumped breastmilk if she doesn't eat it all, which she usually doesn't. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because she seems a little fussy every time after eating her cereal mixed with the forumla. Maybe that is just because she is used to breastmilk or maybe it's even the cereal."
5,Very satisfied,"There are several brands and formulas out there, and it is clear for us that Enfamil Lipil w/Iron is the best one. We has been using it to feed our first and only daughter since she was 3 months old, with excellent results. The down side is that Enfamil Lipil w/Iron is the most expensive of all Enfamil and other brands' formulas. I am not sure that the difference in prince is justified thought. But we just do not want to change now the formula that our daughter is already used to. The Amazon's price for this can is the best I ever found."
2,Not especially comfortable,"Scratchy, not soft -- felt like a $3 Gildan shirt relabled at a higher price. Seems like a lot of higher-$$ shirts are really just Gildan in disguise."
3,Not Bad for Its Day,"This book wasn't a bad little mystery/thriller for its time. The action alternates between 1956 and 1976. In the former year, speech therapist David Kersage is hired to cure some stuttering kids in an orphanage, on an island off the coast of Seattle, Washington. Some of them are pretty creepy, and eventually our hero stumbles upon the reason, which is... well, you'll have to read the book. Twenty years later, it's clear that his experience with the kiddies has left him a changed man, and given him a purpose in life -- but will his plan of vengeance succeed?"
3,Obvious Propaganda,"This is obvious pro-Wallace propaganda, especially once you near the end of this little booklet. Despite being an obvious PR campaign, this booklet is actually kind of interesting in that it contains some interesting vintage photos, especially of activists confronting Wallace, etc."
4,Love it. They update often,"I have had this for almost 2 years. I have taken my boat to the bahamas twice. It works perfectly. I added a vision card, satelite weather and a Fuel flow sensor. The satelite weather is excellent but pricey through xm at $50 a month. But there are two lower tiers. They also let you cancel off season. You will need a $300 antenna for that. The sonar works great except for high speeds but that is an issue with my boat hull design I believe. The Fuel flow sensor was a huge pain to wire but it is nice to have. I also have it hooked to my Marine radio which will transmit and receive coordinates. Great visiblity in sunlight. No complaints. Xm radio controls from unit with weather. A visoin card is key for upper level funtions and routing. Great price for this."
2,keep your 478 if you're upgrading,"I ""upgraded"" to this 545s unit from the gpsmap 478.. Simply because the connection on the back of the 478 were not up to the task of saltwater spray for both the XM antenna and power cord... I wish i hadn't. Yes, it's a bigger screen, BUT.. you have to push many more buttons to get to where you want to be on the machine. There is not a simple waypoint entry.. while cruising on a vessel. You have to make multiple entries to save it. The worst loss is of the NOAA forecasts that were on the 478. Now all you get is a little graphical icon and current conditions.. Come on Garmin... make this a useful piece of equipment instead of a boat anchor."
3,"May be the first, but not the best of the series.","Don't let this be your introduction to the Ellery Queen series. While it sets up a nice whodunnit, the characters and pace are a little uneven. Dannay and Lee were just getting started with their famous detective and it shows as the story is rough around the edges. It also hasn't really aged well. There is a lot of slang and habits from the late twenties and early thirties that, for me, dates the story too much and diminishes the atmosphere of the book - fine for it's time but a little out of place 70 years later. Queen (Dannay and Lee) didn't hit their stride until several novels later."
1,Why do people who think like this still exist?,"As a crusty old, bisexual liberal I raise a toast every year to celebrate Reagan's death and when this woman departs the earth I will do the same...for exactly the same reasons. I don't especially like hateful, bigoted, conservative people who are a menace to individual freedom.Even for her this is a trans/homo/bi-phobic, simplistic, asexual, joy-killing tome and that is saying something. She's like Cotton Mather with an extra X chromosome.P.S. It's really not OK for any feminist old enough to remember gay and bisexual men dying in the plague of the early AIDS epidemic (including pioneers for the rights of all LGBT people like Stephen Donaldson) to be homophobic."
3,"OK, but you get less product","As compared to other brands, the amount of scrub is less. This one has only 4.2 oz, as compared to others that are at least 5 oz. Feels oily, even though states ""Oil-free"". Smell is ok, but Clean & Clear Morning Burst is a bit more exciting."
2,Disgusting smell...doesn't help with oil or acne.,"First of all, this stuff smells absolutely disgusting!!! I tried to look past the horrid smell and give it a chance to help my skin. I'm sorry to say that it was a big disappointment. I didn't notice a decrease in oil or a positive change in my acne. Unfortunately, I had to give up on this scrub and throw the rest away. The smell was simply not worth the mediocre results. I'm now using St. Ives Apricot Scrub for oily/acne prone skin and I'm very satisfied with it...it's cheaper, too!"
2,Salicylic acid,"This product DOES contain salicylic acid, for those that are sensitive to it, like me. It always clogs my pores and makes my skin break out, which is the opposite of what it's supposed to do, I know. Read the ingredients and you will see it listed there."
5,"The best face cleanser, I've been using it for years!","I love this product. First of all, It smells like St.Joseph's Aspirin For Children. That's an orange candy smell. It's refreshing and delicious. ""Refreshing"" is the best word for this scrub. It freshens my face in the summer by scrubbing off the layers of sweaty dead skin and sun lotion, and it freshens my complexion in the winter by sloughing off the dead winter skin. I have combination skin, and this scrub softens and cleans and balances and leaves me with soft fresh skin. I LOVE THIS. Sometimes I get bored and buy something else, but I always go right out and buy more of this scrub. I can't live without it."
5,Love this stuff,"Being in a nasty environment in a foreign country, you really need something worth while to clean out your pores. This product is great. My wife uses it and I decided to try it out and it really does make a difference with how your face feels (cleanliness-wise). Great prodcut and I would definitely recommend it."
4,good product with great price,"I am very hard on phone cases. The average life of a case is 5 months at best. This is regardless of price. These cases are inexpensive, and they last as long or longer as $40.00 cases. Especially important is the dual retention of straps and a spring clip. I have yet to have a case fall off.Good product....low cost."
2,"Oh no, not again...","I love Delerium's music (it's some of the best around) and these remixes are probably really very good but I, along with many other fans I'm sure, are deathly sick of hearing this song released over and over again. We've already established the fact that this song sounds great as a dance mix so when will it ever be enough? I understand this song was a big hit for them, thanks in part to mega-star Sarah McLachlan lending her gorgeous vocals to the lyrics, but lets move on already...I'm eagerly anticipating their next record of all new material (reportedly set for release next Fall, 2005) but please no more ""Silence"" remixes."
5,Arth X Platinum,This product worked wonders for me. My knees have given me extreme pain for over 10 years and this is the first product that helped but did not cause any stomach problems for me. I was very sad to see the price go from $29.21 to $37.81 in under six months. I will continue to use it and hopefully the price will go back down to a reasonable cost.
2,"A couple of impressive tracks, but still too weak.","Despite being a Chesky fan, I wasn't really pleased with this sampler. At only 48 minutes (I wonder why Chesky didn't offer a bit more, since they could have easily mastered an extra 30 minutes into the CD), there are few impressive performances in this sampler.The best track is definitely Dave's True Story's ""Dear Miss Lucy"". Excellent album. However, pretty much the rest is somewhat unimpressive.Two other exceptions might be The Coryells (Amazing sound engineering and vocals) and Rebecca Pidgeon's ""Underground"".Ana Caram's bossa nova rythms and perhaps Paquito D'Rivera's tracks might be great to test those high-end headphones or speakers.... that's pretty much all however...Overall, I expected much more from this sampler, both in quantity and quality."
3,A Mothers Love,"The story of a ""Mother's Love"" is a priceless inspirational blessing. The journey Angela traveled gives the reader an opportunity to understand her relationship with God through her travels from one obstacle to the next. I was encouraged as I began to read the authors testimony in the story she told with humble humility.Much Respect,Jackson Mississippi Readers Club Reviewer"
4,My son loves it!,My 6-year-old son loves this CD. It comes with a workbook that he completed all on his own...which is amazing for a somewhat lazy kid who never wants to do his homework. The first one got lost and I had to order it again because he kept asking for it.
5,Old school is better than no school at all!,"If you want to know the roots of Kirk Franklin, Mary Mary, et al, you need to listen to this album. I owned this on the original LP, and I nearly played it to death! As far as I know, this is the only recording of the spiritually hilarious ""You Don't Have to Jump No Pews,"" a reminder to his fellow charismatics/Church of God in Christ brothers that ""it's not based on emotion or feelings, but faith in God's Word and receiving."" I love the musicianship, the life and faith this recording reflects. It is also one of the last appearances on record with the late Dannibelle Hall, a longtime Crouch backup singer. If you want to know why Andrae Crouch has such staying power, this recording will tell you all you want to know--and then some!"
3,Piano Playing with Piano Questions Answered,"I was slightly disappointed in this book. I did not feel that I learned very much that I didn't already know. There were a fewanswers to some problems that I have been experiencing on the piano, however, for the most part the answers to the questions were rather simple and common sense.I also felt that this book, written in the early 1900's, was outdated. I did get a good chuckle though from some of the advice.I felt that a beginner may have gleaned more usefull information from this book than I did.If you are looking for in depth answers, and advice on piano playing, etc. this didn't do it for me."
2,Don't buy this book,"I have to be honest. I do not like this book. I don't even think I got through the first chapter. I am a real nut about piano playing and piano theory, so if there is something good in the book I guess I just missed it. I was so bored reading it I just tossed it.I gave it 2 stars just because there may be something good in the book I missed."
4,Awesome Delay Tube Driven,"Here's a Delay Pedal with incredible depth that's sure to delight even the most discerning musician. From Ultra Clean Repeats to even the most dirtiest ""Tube"" Driven Delays this Pedal Has it All!Only recommendation (and the reason why I gave this pedal 4 stars) replace the 'stock' 12AX7 Tube with a good quality (I used a Mullard) 12AU7.Tonal Bliss!Check one out, with the right tube this delay will send you places you have only dreamed a good delay can do."
1,"They sent me the wrong item! The inseam is only 8""!","Like the other reviewer indicates in his review, I bought these shorts expecting a 10"" inseam, but they arrived with an 8"" inseam. The description lists these shorts as having a 10"" inseam. I wish I had read his review before ordering! I called the store (1-800-569-9038) and in their system, this short DOES have an 8"" inseam, so they think they sent me the appropriate item. They need to fix the info on this page! Anyway, I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error. I explained the situation, and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that. So in the end, I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me (they won't refund that) and of course, I never got the shorts I wanted. At least I don't have to pay to return them, thank goodness. Still-- it's annoying."
1,Completely dissatisfied,"Although the item was listed as having a 10"" inseam, it only had an 8"" inseam. Had I known this, I would never have purchased the shorts. Because of the inaccurate listing, I had to pay shipping both ways - for delivery and to return the item. In sum, I would never do business with this seller again."
3,Kidney Bean Earrings,"These earrings looked much better on the website than they do in real life. They are quite bigger than I expected and the hook part of the earring is very long & can look a bit strange because of it. One of the earrings had a deep gouge in it, but it isn't too noticeable unless you look at it closely. I guess I was hoping they would be nicer, but I do plan on keeping them."
4,Nice Shoes for the price,I was looking for a nice looking pair of shoes for a decent price and this most certainly fits the bill.The only bad thing is that it has absolutely zero support and is a bit like the leather version of converse All-Stars.
5,Powerful!,"This is one of the most powerful stories I've ever watched about the Soledad Brothers. Gary Dourdan is a superb actor! I've admired his work since ""Different World & Laurel Canyon."" I allowed my students to watch & it sparked major interest in the Black Panther parties mission and the injustice in the prison systems(which is still prevalent today)."
2,Action but no depth,"The only thing going for this book is its action. At times the author attempts to introduce characters to the story, but he often either forgets to revisit them or utterly fails to develop them in any depth. The descriptions of action sequences are also devoid of detail. And then there are the odd phrases. Read this book for classics like: ""It was the guy who flew the super-duper secret plane,"" and ""Osama bin Laden looked like a Boy Scout [...] compared to the Great Zim.""In short, I gave this one two stars only because I'm reserving the one star rating just in case one of the previous two books in the series deserves it more."
3,Some Good. Some Bad. Nothing Riveting.,"I am just going to review every movie on here so you can see which ones are good or bad.(best:***** worst:0)Scream of the Wolf:*** Kind of boring, but still okayWolf Man:**** Good Movie. Bad Makeup.Moon of the Wolf:** Okay Movie. Werewolf looks dumb.Snowbeast:**** Entertaining. Good Creature but not seen enough.Silent Night, Bloody Night:0 Boring as HELL!!!Don't Look in the Basement:0 Huh? Pointless.Jack the Ripper: 0 (AGAIN) One word why this movie sucks:DubbingSatanic Rights of Dracula:**** Very Entertaining.House on Haunted Hill:***** Very Spooky. Vincent Price is greatNight of Living Dead:***** Scary. Disturbing. Dark. I loved it.Overall, not worth it. Get Night of Living Dead, House on Haunted Hill, and Satanic Rights of Dracula and forget the others."
1,poor quality,I own a couple of the movie's that are included in this set which were brought separatily.These were recorded from old tapes or film reels (uncleaned) with continuous tracking line and graining. Not worth the money at any price. They are used the WOW factor to get your money.Buy the singles
5,I Love It,"I love how people buy a DVD with a big skull on the cover, and then are disappointed because the horror movies are cheesy.I ESPECIALLY respect the guy who gave ""Don't Look In The Basement"" a ""0"" rating. Of course, there was someone who gave ""Last House on the Left"" 1 star also, so...you summer blockbuster types are everywhere, arent you?If you liked The Scream Trilogy The Blair Witch project and you can't sit through anything that has less action the Night of the Living Dead, then you shouldnt buy this film, because it isn't for you. Go to Blockbuster Video and rent Freddy vs. Jason and stop rating movies about which you know nothing."
4,return of the bcieclipse 10 pack,"i own a few of these sets and i like them. the transfers are not the best , very few of the movies are in widescreen, but the movies are just like i remember them to be when i watched them on late night t.v., so the washed out colors and pops on the sound track are fond memories to me. as always b thru z grade horror movies but at such a low price its worth the money. a great way to build your collection."
5,\m/,Excellent album. By far BLS's hardest though still very well written and not lacking those sweet soft tunes Zakk surprises us with. HIGHLY recommend to all metal fans. A Black Label Society collection would not be complete without this album.
3,Zakk! Hire someone who can sing man!,"The guitar playing is great, but often muddled in the mix. Although Zakk sings well, he just doesn't have the explosive voice talent to match the music. His voice is very heavy, but hey, if you dig the voice then great. That's the reason I gave it 3 stars. Rock on!"
4,The hard album Ozzy fans have waited for,"If you are looking for an album which blends the music of Pantera, Black Sabbath, and Corrosion of Conformity, here you go. Zakk has listened to what his fans have always wanted and has delivered an album full of thick heavy riffs and exploding solos. Yes there are a couple slower songs ""Rust"" ""Just Killing Time"", but they too are impressive for this one time Ozzy hacker. I doubt that any radio station will have the balls to play any of these songs, but I know I will be cranking this cd over and over. The stand out tunes are ""Superterrorrizer"" ""Counterfeit God"" and the epic ""Love Reign Down"". Go get it now!"
1,Weaker than life...,"Boy, I like Zakk Wylde's frame of work with OZZy. I loved his solo effort in PRIDE AND GLORY (1994). But this Black Label is junk. Such awkward noise, guitars all tunned down, it's almost nu-metal. But a bad one, with disconnected song structures, annoying vocals by Zakk... can't believe he wrote this..."
2,Poor Follow Up,"The fact that this album was written and recorded less than a year after BLS's ""Sonic Brew"" might have something top do with its unfinsihed sound and unfocused songs. Zakk Wylde just probably didn't have enough time. ""All For You"" opens in good Sabbath form, but after that there are problems. The vocals in ""Phony Smiles"" and ""13 Years Of Grief"" are so poorly mixed as to be inaudible. I thought maybe one of my speakers was out. The laid back laments of ""Just Killing Time"" and ""Rust"" are redeeming, but short-lived before the album careens back into more uninspired monolithic riffs. This work feels rushed and under the gun, as it more than likely was."
3,"Oh, Lorda, this is heavy!!","If you're searching for intricacies, tricky guitar solos, pretty melodies, this album is not for you. If you wanna listen Zakk plays with anger and uncommon aggression, this is the album for you. STRONGER THATN DEATH is HEAVIER THAN DEATH!! The album is difficult to diggest in the beginning, it's almost industrial at some moments, Zakk's vocals are not the best role model for an aspiring lead singer....But, once you forget theses flaws, you will enjoy the sheer weight of this record. Amazaing stuff."
5,Metal has a name & it is Zakk,Probably the best record I've ever heard. Most definitely the heaviest. If you give this MetalGod anything less than five stars than you must be some Fascist (....). Zakk is the Greatest. (....)LatuerSkid
3,No tasty leads,"I am a big fan of Zakk with Ozzy, so I bought this CD thinking I would hear some of the same guitar style. There are some very good riffs and I'm not going to throw it away by any means, but I was expecting more from Zakk in the lead solos. They are all balls to the wall, try to hit as many notes as you can with little style and no soul."
4,"Not Their Best, but Still Strong","A good effort from Zakk Wylde and the Black Label Society boys! It is perhaps a bit redundant at points, but there are song definite strong points that make it an album worth hearing."
3,Deceptive,"This is NOT a 9V battery. This is a 9V SIZE battery, but even at full charge only supplies a maximum of 7.2 volts. The reason for this is that NiMH cells provide a lower voltage than do alkaline cells, so you can't get exactly 9V BUT if Energizer had added 1 more cell, they could have gotten 8.4 volts which is very close. For some reason (most likely monetary) they decided to cut us out on 1.2 volts (I feel cheated as a customer--minus 1 star). In most cases, this isn't a problem (thus a rating higher than 1 or 2 stars) since devices that use batteries are made to work under a variety of voltages since batteries lose some voltage as they discharge BUT if you are running a sensitive device that turns off at a threshold at or above 7.2V, then these won't work for you (minus 1 star). Other brands offer 8.4 Volt 9V sized NiMH batteries. I suggest you go with one of those."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this CD thinking it was a music CD. Wrong! It was about someone reveiwing the group Panic at the Disco. Apart from background music there was no music what so ever on this CD.If you are interested in background info on a group then buy this CD. However, if like me, you like listening to music do not buy this CD."
1,OK,"Would somebody please put up a track listing, it's really annoying trying to get any information on this album. There's lots of false advertising associated with it."
5,WOW! Amazing Information for the price,"WOW and AMAZING are the two words that come to mind after watching this DVD. The content, the laughs, the knowledge you will possess after watching this DVD. If you want to be making the Big Money then this DVD set is for you! No nonsense, straight to the point information with rock solid results! SNAG this one while you can!"
4,Good historical reader,Very detailed and a little repetitive. The author could have told the entire fascinating story in half as many words.
5,Magnum Opus of Feynman,Freshman lectures by one of the great physicist of all times. Feynman's teaching style is just incredible. He gives new perspectives to classical ideas in physics. This book is for anyone who has interests in science or who loves nature and wants to learn more about it.
5,Science books,Feynman lectures have been the manna of science students for years now. I have been reading these from childhood and it never ceases to amaze me.Mr.feynman is not just a scientist exemplar but also an orator and writer of great ability.
2,Unsatisfying,"Perhaps if this book had been published 10 years ago, it might have been more groundbreaking. However, it follows many other published accounts of Chinese-Americans and their difficulty growing up with two cultures. This book would have been more interesting if the author had tried to understand further the conflict between herself and her parents. She present her difficulties from her point of view only and does not offer insights into why they existed. The reader is left thinking 'there must be more to this story'."
4,"I found the book interesting, sad, and hope for more.","As someone who is not that familiar with the Chinese-American culture, I found Elaine's recount of her childhood very interesting. The recollections are quite vivid and made one want to read more and more as this young girl tries to find who she is and why. The book helps to put a more defining look at families and their dynamics. I hope that Ms. Mar will pick up from this book and give a much more detailed look at her experience at Harvard. I look forward to seeing how this ""cultural shock"" was dealt with and further relationship issues with her family."
4,"A great book, but ...","The author should learn that she could go to her inner self, her family and her culture for strength. Instead, she keeps seeking validation from an inherently exclusionary source, namely a racially-callous and class(read money)-conscious society. The reality remains that there will forever be societal classifications that are intolerant of each other. Belonging to any does not make you a lesser person, but hesitating in between will make you miserable. Some barriers you just cannot cross without much repudiation of your self value.But, hey, this is a memoir, not a political thesis."
2,Selfish and No respect daughter,"After I read this book, I feel really shock. The author show no respect to her family especially her parents.I understand her difficult of live (poverty) but its doesn't mean she can judge her parents and show no respect to them."
5,EXCELLENT-VERY ENTERTAINING,"I loved this book, there were many things about being Chinese or in USA that I could identify, especially wearing glasses, getting teased, not having many friends, not having parents understand the American ways, etc! I read this w much delight but found the ending too abrupt, as if she finished writing in a huge hurry. I got this from the library & finished in 4 days so I will buy it at the store so I can share it with others."
3,A well-written book but a little too sad!,"I liked the first several chapters of the book, for its vivid description of Hong Kong and its culture. I was also touched by the somtimes painful but detailed stories of the author's childhood, such as the school Meenie T shirt she wanted so badly but could not get, but I was a little disappointed at her overall tone of the story. It seems that all she could remember and write down were the negative side of life. Perhaps that's the way she felt all along, but as a reader I just want a little more fresh air. Overall, it is a well-structured book of personal struggle and growth and is worth a read, but it is just not one of my favorites."
2,"Another ""Woe is Me "" Story","I hope the author is not expecting any sympathy or respect for this book, since she obviously lacks any for her own family. I was offended at the way she exposes her family's privacy with little thanks or appreciation for their struggle. She dedicated the book to her parents, but that was it. What first generation American did not struggle with identity and parental conflicts? As a Chinese American woman born in Hong Kong as well, I am tired of reading books with the same theme of us needing to escape from home and be saved by white America. She is only emphasizing the stereotype of the backward Chinese parents who are a barrier to popularity. Get over it and go on with your life!"
5,A fascinating prediction of human behavior that is 100% true,"This book reads like a novel even though it is fact. I have applied the data from this book to life and found the information to work all the time. The first part of the book is devoted to prediction of behavior through observation of the individual in question. As an example; by seeing how a person behaves toward one aspect of life one can surley say how he or she will function in the other areas of life. This is the ultimate guide on "" How to choose your people "" Find out how to choose a mate, an employee, a babysitter etc; You will not be sorry! The 2nd part of the book ""Book Two"" I had no use for since I was not interested in the therapy."
2,dissapointed,this is just a boring extension of dianetics. dianetics was such a good book with hope for humanity. too bad they didn't move in that direction. i'm taking this copy to the goodwill for a donation where it will probably sit for eternity
5,Less damage done but still good,"Not as good as the amazing first album/ single, mainly because it lacks Wobble, nor as adventurous, but still great to listen to. A second album with all the original members was not likely but I am glad they made this sequel anyway. Chris Connely is my favourite 'industrial' vocalist, with his understated delivery and surreal lyrics. Martin Atkins drumming drives the music well, as ever."
5,Japan in Formosa (Taiwan0,An excellent book that gives a real insight into the Japanese occupation and ruling of the island of Formosa. A book really worth reading on this subject.
2,Only hoof pick I ever had that broke,"I've bought just about every kind of hoof pick I've seen over the years. This one (same as the Equestria brand pick) is by far the most comfortable to use and the blade is easy to work around the hoof - much better than the $1 plastic picks with the brushes on them.BUT it is the only pick I've ever had that has broken: I was cleaning a hoof last weekend, and suddenly something goes 'snap!' in the pick handle and the blade comes loose and useless. Obviously there is some cheap crap in the handle and the metal blade does not extend very far down. Grrr."

5,What an unusual book! Great!,"As a husband and wife reading team, we don't always agree on how to rate the books we read, but this one was a no-brainer: It's five stars all the way.We usually take turns reading a chapter or two a night; it's our way of relaxing after hard days at DMV where we work ... and you all know what a hectic place the Dept. of Motor Vehicles in California is like!Anyway, this book was so captivating that we found ourselves reading five or six chapters a night; hurrying through dinner to do so. We couldn't wait to see the evolution of Collie's mind processes and how she handled this very difficult situaiton she's placed in.What a girl! What a book! This is one you just gotta read!"
4,Great for boating,"Honestly....I don't fish. I bought this card for the water depth information that it provides. I boat in the ""Chain of Lakes"" in Fox Lake, IL. My gps only provides me lake boundaries, and the fishing hot spots gives me greater detail. I like it, and I found it on Amazon for less than HALF the price my local marine dealer wanted to sell it to me for....."
2,Not up to par,"I am a huge Mabel Maney fan, but I was disappointed in this book. There's no light hearted romance in this book--just endless inventories of horrible 1950s pop culture items, and tiresome characters beating each other up. Jane spends the entire book in drag with a glued-on unibrow. Way too much of the book is about Cedric and his unappealing love interest. I kept waiting to be entertained and charmed, as I inevitably am by Maney, and instead I felt just slightly ill. Read the Nancy Clue books or the original Jane Bond parody, but borrow this one from someone who will take it back."
4,"""there's so much beauty...""","Rich Mullins once wrote ""there's so much beauty around us for just two eyes to see."" And so it is with the poetry of this ancient Greek lady Sappho. Without her extra eyes, I would be robbed of some sights I could not have found without her. For instance, in one of her poems, she writes:""Awed by her splendorStars near the lovelymoon cover their ownbright faceswhen sheis roundest and lightsearth with her silver""Not only is there beauty. There is a straightforwardness and frankness to the poems of Sappho. It is a clear distillation of the poet's vision confronts the readers of these pages.There is also wisdom and humor. As when she writes:""Experience shows usWealth unchaperonedby Virtue is neveran innocuous neighbor""Mary Barnard is to be praised for these clear, unvarnished translations. Likewise, the introduction is very useful in dispelling so much of the myth that has sprung up around the legacy of this great poet. I recommend this book highly."
3,"lovely, yet far away","I hate to say it, but this book made me somewhat regret studying Ancient Greek. I was given a copy by a friend and utterly adored it. It lived in my purse. I found the poems graceful in their simplicity, the imagery beautiful. Then I was asked to translate some Sapphic poetry for class and attempted to use this book as a reference by which to check my work. I unfortunately found that many of the translations had words and lines missing and added (including the title-like fist lines of each translation) and some were so different from the original poems that I had a hard time even finding a correlation between the two. If you want a lovely book of poetry then I highly recommend this book, if you want a brilliant translation of the Greek then I would suggest you do it yourself, as I have, as of yet, been unable to find a competent translation."
5,the Lesbian lesbian,"Because Sappho was a Lesbian who wrote about lesbian love, her poetry was banned at times throughout the ages, and therefore to this day there are only surviving fragments of her work and almost no complete poems. But of the fragments there is more than enough to ensure her place as one of the great female poets of all time. She wrote mainly love poems about things like passion, jealousy, and hostility towards her enemies. This book includes all of her surviving verse in a very readable and enjoyable translation.David Rehakauthor of ""Poems From My Bleeding Heart"""
5,Nashville Dulcimers,"This is fantastic a must for any one who love's old time country music, this is a must to own"
2,HAD TO RETURN,THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO WORK THIS LOCK IS NOT SECURE DOES NOT HAVE KEY IT COULD COME OFF AND ONLY CAN BE USED WHEN YOU ARE NOT LEAVING YOUR CAR FOR A LONG PERIOD ALONE SINCE ANYUNE COULD TAKE IT OFF AND AWAY WITH YOUR BIKE RACK OR WHAT EVER YOU ARE CARRYING
4,Its A Good British Horror Movie,If you like those early 70's British horror movies I think that you will like this one.Made in 72' A group of people find out that there is an ancient relic on this island. So the group go out and try and find it. But the trip dosent go as planned. First they lose there boat so they are stuck there on the island. Then a bunch of them are killed by a psycho killer that is on the island.I think that this is a good movie for any British cult horrror movie fan. Pick it up at amazon.
4,70's British slasher in the light tower,"I absolutley loved this little under the radar low budget Brit slasher horror from 1971.Very dark and dreary atmosphere filled with good old fashioned doom and gloom.Bellbottoms,tacky colors and fab late 60's early 70's hair-do's.2 couples take a night time boat ride to an island looking for one's relative when the weather takes a turn for the worse they decide to sleep it off in a lighthouse,which seals their fate.Perfect mood setter for a night at home when it's raining out."
2,A great transfer to DVD; a far from great movie.,"I first saw Tower of Evil when I was ten years old and remembered being scared by that viewing. After just recently seeing it for the second time, I discovered that the film has lost much of its punch. The film starts off strong leading the viewer to a gruesome discovery and a path of mystery waiting to be revealed. Then things slow down. I don't mean just applying the brakes, I'm talking putting it on the parking gear! Towards the end it began to pick up, but the final ""twist"" felt very flat to me. However, I must give a strong Kudos to Elite Entertainment for their brilliant job in the remastering of this film. The picture quality is excellent and the cinematography beautifully stands out. I hope in the future, Elite does this sort of fine work on better films. I recommend this to the slasher movie completist only."
4,Fun if cheaper,"With five dollar shipping this would not be worth it--but as for the product itself, i find it kinda fun if you find it for only a few cents.There are 4 red card and 4 yellow cards. Every red is the same and every yellow is the same--so there are only 2 variations.The red card has choices like--What: Shower Together/Champagne in bed & Where: hotel & When: your birthday.The yellow card has dates and has choices like--What: dinner date & Where: your choice & When: next week.That's the set up for every card (red and yellow each have 3 choices but i wont list them all.) You'll end up repeating eventually but it can be a fun, silly little gift if it were only a few pennies."
4,haven't watched yet,Am going to give as a gift to a friend so I have not viewed this movie. Brings back memories.
4,very mellow and consistent,"This was a discovery for me, which began after I was referred to this guy from Ben Harper's website. By the way, check out Ben and Jack's live rendition of Bob Marley's ""High Tide or Low Tide"" which is unfortunately available only somewhere on the Web at 128 kbps... couldn't they put it out somewhere in higher quality or even on some compilation CD? Come on guys! Anyway, half of the songs here are great musically and almost all of them are pretty much OK lyrically... sometimes Jack slips a bit but that's understandable. After all he is certainly no Shakespeare... let's say he's more like Dumas but only if Dumas lived in Hawaii and surfed instead of writing historic novels."
4,"Groovy, gentle, sweet, melancholy, joyful.","I bought this cd for a long flight to Hawaii and it ended up being the only music we listened to in the Jeep the entire trip. What a great soundtrack for island-style adventure! Lines get stuck in your head and some bits are addictive like chocolate-- ""Bubble Toes"" is a great example. Add it to your collection."
3,"Talent Apparent, Hooks Absent","I honestly enjoy this cd, but its more of a background music cd. An album which I fall asleep to. Jack Johnson has a beautiful voice and is an amazing guitarist. His songwriting is clever, his lyrics intriguing, but its difficult to get into the songs when they're often slow moving and somewhat repetitive. As much as I like him, I much prefer John Mayer's Room For Squares because there is more diversity in the songs. Still, I spin Brushfire Fairytales once in awhile. I'll always listen, but never know the words."
3,this is good stuff,"Jack sounds like a cross between Dave Matthews and Bob Marley but has his own sound like nothing i've heard before. ""Fairytales"" has thought provoking lyrics and a jam session style. There are several fast songs, but most are slower. I like ""Flake"" and ""Mudfootball""."
2,are you kidding me?,"I don't understand Jack Johnson...literally. In half the songs I can't hear what he's mumbling about and I don't think his songs are that great. Aside from Bubble Toes, which is decent, nothing else sounds good. Personally, I am much bigger of a John Mayer fan."
2,What's all the fuss?,"We were introduced to this CD by a friend who swore to its greatness. We've listened to it again and again and guess what? It ain't great. There is very little creative or interesting about it. The melodies, such as they are, are partially realized; the lyrics are just okay. While I think this might, for some, be decent background noise, I find the melodies too irritating even for that limited purpose.My advice, listen before you buy. Something screwy is going on with all of these positive reviews. My best guess is that Jack has a couple of hundred friends who owed him a favor."
4,Great blues record,"Don't think this is an indie rock record, please! At first I thought Jack Johnson was a rushed out John Mayer wannabe, then a Ben Harper/DMB rip off, but after listening to his album, I realized he's his own thing and REAL. Imagine somebody having a record deal and being original! Anyway, this album is great if you are into acoustic bluesy simple rock."
5,La-da-da-da-da-da- La-da-da-da-da,Have you ever heard a song that you just couldn't get out of your head? Well this is like an entire album of those songs. The lyrics are not especially deep but you will probably be singing along after a listen or two.
4,Rythmic souds,"More laid back that his ""in between dreams"" album. Great soothing voice. song lyrics vary from topic to topic. Awesome driving music. The song ""Bubble Toes"" make me want to dance everytime I listen to it!"
5,"Magnificent! Buy this CD now, before all your friends do!","I had never heard of Jack Johnson until one of my friends, who'd seen him open for Ben Harper, told me that I'd like his music. I dubiously bought this CD, convinced that since he was so obscure, I wouldn't like him. I was very wrong! This is one of the best albums I've ever heard and Jack Johnson is my new obsession. He has a great, mellow voice that's totally unique, and his songs blend typical guitar type-music with some hints of blues. His lyrics are also amazing, especially in the song Flake where he croons ""It seems to me that maybe... pretty much always means no.."" Some of the songs are quiet and slow, but he speeds up on others, so it's a perfect mix of upbeat and relaxing. This album will put a smile on your face while you fall asleep, and it's also perfect driving music. I really recommend this CD to just about anyone."
4,Awesome CD,"Jack Johnson--in a word, awesome. If you're a fan of Dave Matthews, Jack is the man for you. His lyrics are like Ben Harper, but his tunes combine the sounds of Dave with Ben. Awesome, awesome, awesome!"
5,WOW,Thsi is a wonderful album. I got into Jack because he was opening for Ben Harper. I now like Jack more than Ben. Jack is fun to listen to. I love the little Hawwaiian sounds in some of the songs. Get this album.
5,Shark gives it a thumbs up,"People always ask me, ""Shark, what are your latest recommendations for a new artist or album?"" I have been saying Jack Johnson over and over again, so I tell everyone, ""buy it!"" And for God's sake, go see him. If you like Ben Harper, its like listening to his twin....thats all -san jose shark"
5,Real laid-back music,"Love this album. After a long day at work, I come home lie on my hammock in my backyard and listen to this album. The songs aren't too deep, they are catchy and Jack Johnson's voice fits well with the guitar melodies.I had never heard of Jack Johnson, I came across this cd by accident, I am really glad that I discovered it.Overall, a fun and fast cd its worth owning.In My Humble Opinion"
5,LOVE IT!,Jack Johnson is a wonderful songwriter! I love this CD and it lives in the CD player. It is mellow enough for dinner music and perfect for jamming. I was so inspired by the tunes that I bought a drum and my husband learned all the tabs! It is great great music!
4,"A good, solid effort","Jack Johnson's laid-back, mostly acoustic, simply-produced album is a releif to hear in a time when most pop music was computer-generated, heartless, unmusical junk. Here, Johnson sings about simple, quirky, and funny things (exept on the very sad ""The News"") and his lyrics are catchy and usually rather nonsensical. His bluesy/folky guitar work is fun and unique. His voice is as original as Bob Dylan's. Indeed, the whole record is quite original. The first half is the best, but the second half has some good songs like ""Drink the Water"" and ""It's All Understood"". ""Brushfire Fairytales"" is a good, solid effort.~ John Ballantyne"
5,Great,"I love this CD. It's so great, all the songs are amazing there is not a single bad song. Most people are familiar with flake & bubble toes which are radio hits, but the CD is filled with songs like this, and some are better than those two songs. Some of my favits include Sexy Plexi, Posters, Mudfootball, Inaudible Melodies, but I must say I love all the songs, this is my favorite CD and I listen to it every day! Dont hesitate to buy it. I can't wait untill by and by comes out!"
5,Tunes to Kickback To,"This CD is simply great. Jack Johnson is the most accomplished surfer/musician ever. If you like Ben Harper, get this album. Harper even makes an appearance on the album playing the slide guitar. This is a top-notch product."
2,The most popular whisperer,"This stuff could potentially groove if they had a singer with more vocal presence (doesn't whisper his way through the tunes). Either way, IMO, it's good stuff that has yet to be realized by a better singer. I'm just not feeling it. Almost Damien Rice, but not as eclectic/quirky....just one person's opinion, try to be objective."
3,No fire here,Wasn't a great CD. Not bad either. Have to be in the mood to listen to it. It's not one you would put in the player to just kick back and listen to.
2,over-rated at best,"people seem to flock to the ""singer/songwriters"" nowadays... starting with john mayer and followed by jack johnson... there are a few good songs, but in my opinion nothing spectacular... Basically, I would like to say that this has been done before and is nothing captivating..."
2,Boring,"Jack Johnson is just another in a long line of surf-rockers who's laidback, effortless style will never change. Most of his guitar riffs are the same repetitive chords, and his lyrics are pure lunacy (listen to Mud Football, you'll see what I mean). The only sign of talent on this cd is the opening to brushfire fairytales, but even that song becomes swallowed by the sameness of all the other songs on this cd."
1,"Slightly tuneful, un-witty and permeated with boredom",I am afraid I am going to upset a few people but this CD is a touch on the dull side. Well to be fair it is very very dull indeed. Please do not waste your money on this while there are good recording artists out there. Unless you are an Aussie or a kiwi and then the chances are you will love it.
1,Great concept album!,"Oh! I finally get it! Brushfire fairtales is one big concept album, exploring, and finding, the great meaning of life. That ethereal, vapor of destiny that we all try and find. Some call it God, some call it Buddha, but whatever Jack calls it, he's found it. The simplicity of the same chords over and over again, in the same rhythm, with almost the same melody is just to keep everything from getting too heady so that the true deep meanings behind every lyric can be more readily understood. Man, what a genius. The complex with the simple. The sacred with the profane.No, wait, he's just that unimaginitive and only has one guitar strumming pattern. My mistake.ZZZ"
5,buy this album,"Jack Johnson is a bit of a blues-songwriter, in the same sence that Ben Harper is. I'm sure there will be all too many comparisons with Johnson and Harper, who also happens to appears on track 5, but Johnson is his own force. This is a VERY strong debut album, and I see Johnson finding more of a niche in the industry. Best of luck to the man, he's obviously very talented. Buy this album. Just buy it."
5,wonderful,"Jack Johnson is great! It is a good mellow sound, not too hard rock. If you like good mellow music, go for this cd!"
5,Perfect,I like this music. Perfect for what I need it for. Teaching college students a fitness class. In great condition
5,Great CD,"This CD is awesome! I would definitly recommend this CD to any JJ fans outthere. Inaudible melodies and Flake are my favorite songs on this track, it's lyrics have much meaning and I can realate with real life experiences with these songs. you really have to be in the mood to listen to this CD."
5,"Best New Artist, Best Song, Best Album, Best Record, Best!!!","Mellow, Bluesy, Acoustic, Intelligent, Diverse, Beautiful, Catchy, Fun...just all around awesome.One song that's not on this CD that should be is Rodeo Clowns. Download it!Seriously every song is good.Throw a dart at the song list, listen to it, fall in love with it, repeat."
4,NIIIIIICE!,indeed a nice tone to the album!No need to skip around -My only question is .. When is he coming back to town!
4,Jack Johnson chills!,"...""Slow down everyone ...you're moving too fast..."" Those are the words me and my girlfriend can't forget. We were in Boracay(beach) last April and I was listening to this CD when suddenly Jack belts out those words. It was the perfect soundtrack to what we were doing. Lounging! We were on vacation on a very nice beach, drinking shakes and leaving all the stress of city life. As with all the other albums Jack Johnson is the master in making chill music. Brushfire Fairytales is a tad slower than the other albums but who cares, it's still good lounging music!"
3,"Good voice and nice genre, static percussion","I offer nothing but praise for Mr. Johnson's voice and style. The songs are light-hearted, yet soulful. My only complaint is the percussion. The drummer seems to be glued to a metronome and a snare drum through at least half the songs. It honestly has turned me away from listening to some of the songs the whole way through anymore lest they bring about thoughts of Chinese water torture. I've heard a couple of tracks from his new CD which seem to be an improvement. All in all, a great new voice in music, let's just hope he loses (or seeks lessons for) his drummer!"
4,wonderfully mellow,"jack johnson's first album is great to listen to on lazy sunday afternoons. it's mellow without putting you to sleep, and the lyrics are very singable. it's one of those albums where you can listen to every song and not get tired of it. jack ranges from fun, upbeat, melodic ditties, to thought provoking ballads like ""losing hope."" Jack Johnson is a great up-and-comer and definitely deserves a good listening to. his has been one of the great sleeper hit albums of the past year."
5,I'm in love with this guy!!!,"I hear ""Flake"" on the radio. ""Who's that guy?"", I ask my young friends since the DJ never tells...Same answer for weeks...""dunno"". Finally, someone comes up with ""?Maybe John Jackson, or something like that..."". FINALLY! A Clue! The last song that hit me like ""Flake"" was by a relatively unknown guy named Rob Thomas with Carlos... My girls (13 & 5) are almost as enamoured with Jack Johnson and his incredibly remarkable lyrics and music as I am. So far everyone I've played it for (ie those ""young friends"") have gone out and paid top dollar for this album just like I did...This is one fine dude (and I grew up with some of the original ""fine dudes"" like Carlos)! Buy this CD. Make more Jack!!"
5,One CD I listen to over and over,"I love, love, love this CD. My friend made me a CD with one of his songs on it, and that same day, I ran out and bought the CD, based on the loveliness of that one song, Inaudible Melodies. I have never been dissappointed with it. I listen to it constantly, and it's not just because the CD changer is in the trunk of my car, and I'm too lazy to change CDs. It's because I like the CD--in it's totality. I never listen to the radio, but I think one of his songs is getting airplay. It could be Flake, if so, that's great, if not, it should be. I saw him live at a big outdoor concert venue recently and wasn't too impressed with the live performance. But I think it was because of the overabundance of drunk 18-year-olds present and a [bad] sound system. I don't hold it against him and would pay to seem him again."
4,Acoustic minimalism - cool,"Mainly this is just Jack and his guitar - the multi-talented surfer, filmaker and musician, pared down to simple, heartfelt essentials. Such music can often sound trite, weak, bland or lifeless. Not Jack's opus however. The songs on this album are quietly and sensitively poetic - listen carefully to tracks such as the trad rock 'Flake', 'Inaudible Melodies' and 'Middle Man'. Jack Johnson is an analytical songwriter - he knows what is essential and sticks to it. He conveys a lot with what, on the surface, appears very little. Brings to mind cool, warm Californian evenings on the beach. I've never been there, but this is the atmosphere Jack Johnson seems to create. A cool fusion of surfer philosophy and guitar creativity. Recommended."
3,It is good. But I think I'm missing something!!!!,"I bought this cd with pretty high expectations. I had read so many reviews that were positive and found out that this guy had sold out the House of Blues in Los Angeles for two nights. When I started listening to the cd, my first reaction was that his voice is pretty ordinary. What I asume most people love about him is his sense of humor and his knack for storytelling. Which, all things aside is pretty good. However, musically, it's pretty basic. Comparing his stuff to say Luka Bloom or Steve Poltz isn't really fair because their music has so much more texture and complexity along with brilliant lyrics. If I had to recommend a cd, I would recommend one by one of those artist rather than this guy. Sorry. But hey, it's great background music!"
4,Adore him,I heard him do an interview on the radio and I fell in love with his music. Hunting down all his CDs :).
5,soothen while grooven with my soul,"brushfire fairtales, what can i say, its best to say nothin and just listen to the voice of truth. jack put it all together with this album from every mood you have there is a relevant song. from any aspect of life there is a song. i could spend all day in bed with my girl and listen to this cd. where has the last month gone... a big puff of smoke, jacks soothen voice flowing high above the happy voice that my life has become, i dont care where it went i was there"
3,Simplistic and catchy,"This album is really simple and cute. It's folksy and has catchy little lyrics that will get endlessly stuck in your head. I listened to the album a lot in the first month that I got it and then found that it lost it's appeal. I have tons of folk music and I can't put my finger on why this album didn't become a favorite. It's just so simple that it's not like you find new little things about the songs when you listen to it over and over. Also, there is this song about the evening news that bugs me to no end. This album is sort of like auditory bubble gum...it's fun and tasty at first and then it loses it's flavor and you're ready to toss it."
5,Mellow Surf Sounds are more than Mellow,"Jack Johnson was a name I first hear with G.Love and Special Sauce on the song ""Rodeo Clowns."" I wondered who Jack Johnson was. Now I know. He is an incredible musician from Hawaii who manages to sing of love, loss, and just plain having fun while keeping his music very simple yet whimsical. From the first track ""Inaudible Melodies"" to songs like ""Bubble Toes"" and ""The News."" Johnson reminds us that things don't always have to be so complicated. His simple guitar parts mixed with a great drum and bass beat make for some great catchy tunes that are perfect for that day you just want to relax and have some fun. His lyrics are very heart felt and full of meaning and his voice just carries you away. A must have for anyone who needs something that they can mellow out with or dance in the sand to."
5,Jack Johnson is awesome,I started listening to Jack Johnson when his Between Dreams CD came out. Who knew this gem was just waiting to be discovered?
3,"Okay, but not great","The first half of this album is very good. However, in my opinion, the second half looses quite a bit of its quality."
1,An excellent alternative to ipecac!,"What is this? I've heard better sounds coming out of a Taco Bell bathroom on 79 burrito day! Oh man, this record makes me wanna VOMIT! Bllleaaaarrgggghhhhhhhhh!"
1,unsatisfactory review,"I don't this album at all, cause the music is somehaw strange and not very qualitative, the words are not interesting."
1,And the Lemmings follow,"Radio picks their ""new thing"" with healthy push from the record company, and we have the next instant star! Please have a mind of your own people! Remember Garth Brooks and his Chris Gains publicity stunt. Well Chris is back and his name is ""Jack Johnson"" If you're looking for watered down acoustic folk with top 40 lyrics which insult your intelligence then pick this up and give it another 5 star review like everyone else. Congratulations, you are now part of the ""in crowd"". Personally, I'd rather be out!"
1,Another Piece of [garbage] album that everybody will love!,"Now lets be honest people, do you like Jack Johnson because he actually produces new and innovative music, or is it because you have to like him to be in the know? Well this is a classic example of why the music industry [isn't good] these days, all this album is, is a mess of repetetive songs that don't stand out in any way among all the talentless artists that tear up the charts these days. The thing about Jack Johnson is he floats under the radar so much that he hasn't really been blamed for the aweful music he creates. So why is it that it's not that hard to go platinum these days and it used to be a career defining moment to go gold? because of every single person who watches MTV religiously and listens to music only because their friends do. They call it catchy, I call it [garbage], they call themselves music lovers, I call them sheep. By the way if you want to here good current rock music, listen to the White Stripes."
1,kev al,"This would be a very good, calming folk album, if it wasn't for the annoying drums. Everytime that same drum came in,on every song,it ruined everything.Im going to check out his new album. Maybe he left the drummer on the islands."
1,"For An Old Man, It's Just Deja vu","I note that there are 449 reviews on this CD and I don't have time to search them all, but has ANYONE out there noticed this artist's pale imitation of Michael Franks? Besides me, is there anyone out there old enough to remember Michael Franks? A twenty-five year old graduate student has me listening to this and one of my co-workers (who's in her early 30s) has sung this person's praises. I feel I cannot join the chorus. For those who think this is new, go back to the seventies and discover Mr. Franks. Then you will realize how clumsily Mr. Johnson has copied someone else's muse."
1,Boooorrrring,"After listening to the entire CD, I want my money back. Jack Johnson uses near-identical chord progressions and strum patterns on every song on this CD. Each song sounds exactly like the one before it, and quite frankly I can't listen to it without falling asleep. For better mellow folk-rock type music, check out the Indigo Girls."
5,Love it!,"I love this cd. His voice is so pleasing to the ear, the words are meaningful, and its just a joy to listen to. I have to drive a lot for work, and popping this cd in makes the ride so much more enjoyable and happy!"
5,AWESOME,"I am totally impressed by this newcomer who has talent coming out of his ears. If you like John Mayer or Jason Mraz (another great newcomer) then you will love Jack Johnson. His clean lyrics make it easy for the whole family to listen to on a long car ride. His music has a light feel to it also, you don't feel like he is screaming in your face, it's like he's just talking to you. And songs like ""The News"" also let you know how sweet and caring a guy he is. I recommend this CD to EVERYONE!"
5,Catchy Tunes,"Jack Johnson got such a great start because of his surfing followers on the west coast. Thankfully, he became so successful that I got to hear him in the middle of the U.S.If you can't decide whether or not to buy this cd, I highly recommend it. So far, everyone that I have recommended it to has loved it. Every song is very catchy and has its own tune. All of Jack's songs are so pure and come from the heart. I just bought this cd for the third time because I lost it twice before. With any other cd, I would not have considered buying it again. This cd never grows old....Every song is great, but my favorites are: Inaudible Melodies, Posters, Flake and Losing Hope. Some other artists that I like are: Ben Harper, John Mayer, Dispatch, Howie Day and G. Love."
5,The best of the best....,"This was the first Gospel album I heard over 24 years ago even before I was saved. It touched me then and it touches me now. It's a classic in every sense of the word and each and every song still inspires and moves me to tears of joy. I highly recommend it for it's spontaneity, it's raw emotion and the best gospel singing I have ever heard. It's a must have for a true and true gospel fan's collection!"
5,Gospel History,"This is a cd you can't put down!It's the roots of Baptistgospel.Walter Hawkins & Love Alive choir were the first to putit on wax live!! No fancy instruments just pianos,organs,drums and guitars.It reaches the SOUL !!!"
2,A snippet of James Madison,"The copy I had, oddly starts at Chapter 6 at a page in the 200's. The book is not really in his own words but rather a bio with his letters included. Compared to more current bi-ops, this book falls a litle flat."
2,DISAPPOINTED,This was unavailable for so long I figured it had to be gold.When I finally got it disappointment is the only way I can describe it. definitely not his best work and the sound is flat. There is much better Al Hirt out there.
5,smewhat slow delivery but accurate and wellpackeged. thank you!,the item was a little slow getting here but it was well-pakaged and exactly as ordered. thank you. woud order agsj
1,"seemed like drying sheets, hard time cleaning my cd's","I do karaoke and have over 500 cd-s. I use a special machine to clean them, polish out the scratches and apply an anti-statis spray to them. With these cloths they seem to small and take to long to wipe down my cd's. I'm using some flannel PJ's right now which seem to work great, quickly and no lint or scratches. Hopefully I can find some decent cloths because I clean so many CD's. The machine I use for cleaning the CD-s is professional grade and run's about $199, I can use 1200 grit sandpaper for very deep scratches, but normaly I use two different cleaning compounds and then the spray so there is a lot to clean after I run my CD-s through this machine."
3,project mate 2,"This is a nice kit for small projects, But any thing of great size I would think about it. The price I bought it at was fair, but after I did buy it I seen it at the B&D outlet cheaper. Still small OK...Big no way."
5,Nearly Impossible To Find,EZSD's Game 2 Be $old is an extremely rare album. I had the cd in the mid 90's until someone stole my whole collection. I was in shock when I came across a mint copy at a local record shop. I snatched it up even though the price was quite hefty. The album is great. It's got some really great songs that just about any rap fan would enjoy. It's a shame that such a great album is so unknown. Solar Music Group and In A Minute Records released some of the best albums of all time.
5,Lovely Fragrance,"I have loved this fragrance since it first came out. There have only been a few fragrances that I have ever REALLY liked enough to wear daily and this is one I particularly like. For me, the fragrance is nostalgic - it takes me back in time and has a soothing effect for me. Neither the rose nor the jasmine overwhelm the other. And the fragrance itself is not overbearing. It is a perfectly balanced blend of two of my favorite flower fragrances."
4,Great beginners guide and reference source.,"For those who learn best visually, it is extremely helpful to have screenshots of html code along side a screenshot of how the code will be rendered in the web browser. These pictures are worth a thousand words as it is like having someone literally pointing to a computer screen while explaining how the html works."
4,relieves neck pain,"I originally ordered this for my 88-yr old mother. It was too firm for her, so I used it myself. At first I was put off by the cylinder shape as I prefer the U-shaped travel pillows; but after sleeping on it a few nights, I really liked this pillow. I'll recommend it to anyone with neck or shoulder problems. I also use it to put under my armpits to stretch my upper arm and shoulder muscles!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020NRIK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Hard as a rock.,"I was looking for a neck roll pillow to sleep on, If you like sleeping on something that feels like crunchy rocks, you'll like this pillow. It wasn't for me. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer had put the buckwheat in some sort of lining, so (1) you could remove some of the buckwheat to make this thing more pliable, and (2) so the cover could be washed. But the buckwheat is just stuffed into the zipped cover. The zipper is good to have, but what are you supposed to do with the load of buckwheat, when you want to take it out to wash the cover? And then how do you funnel it back in?! Anyway, mine became a donation to the local church thrift shop."
4,Remembrance of things past,"Aksakov's book belongs in the rich tradition of memoirs. It is the kind of book in which the author tries to ""recover"" those days of learning and growing up, which made us be what we are. Sincerity and honesty are crucial to accomplish the task, and in this book, Aksakov gets the upper hand. The style is dry, but not boring; the images are beautiful, both in moments of joy and of sorrow. Inevitably, Aksakov's voice is nostalgic: he longs to be there once again, trodding the streets and rural roads he used to walk with people long gone. His style is practical and direct, and there is not an excess of ornamentation or digressions. Besides, it is an interesting glimpse into life in Russia during the Nineteenth century, full of memorable moments and images."
3,"A ""short"" Russian classic","I read this book as part of a Russian history class I took in college. The book was assigned reading because of its portrayal of life in the Russian countryside for those who were not strictly peasants. The book's title refers to Stepan, a Russian gentleman, landowner, who is also a patriarch of a family, one of whom is his grandson, the book's author. The book examines Russian culture and family life, potraying the pride, illiteracy, and male chauvinism that dominated it. The story itself is somewhat boring, and I only found it interesting due its portrayal of a society few Americans have any idea about."
1,coco & igor movie,"i bought the movie ""coco & igor"" along with ""coco before chanel"" as the reviews were quite good. but....this has to be one of theworst movies i have ever seen! i did enjoy 'coco before chanel'and audrey tautou did a wonderful job as coco chanel. however,""coco & igor"" was not even close....the casting of coco chanelwas way off. the actress anna mouglais, that played coco, wasjust too tall for the part and did not at all come across ascoco chanel. the editing of the movie was horrible as well.if i could i would return it for a refund.....there was absolutelyno flow to the story and if one did not know any history ofcoco chanel or igor stravinksy, it would have been impossible to follow. there was no need for all the nudity or sex either. thatcertainly did not represent chanel at all! i think if she werealive she would be appalled at this vulgar display. otherthan seeing the chanel fashions and her glorious house, it wasa complete waste of time."
3,Interesting by vyctorynotes.blogspot.com,I found this film to be interesting. I think it is worth it to see the film; it has historical perspective. I enjoyed the acting.
4,"""A lot of gray, between the black and white.""","A surprise on late night Starz. Preparing for bed... once begun I could not resist until the end. Others have outlined the plot, events, and all that. And whether true or not, to how many degrees possible, I found this totally engrossing and captivating. Very glad I got to see it by ""accident."" Stunningly done, very low key, and truly tasteful; elegant, thoroughly enjoyable. Acting, set design, music, direction, all superbly sublime."
3,did not do justice,"I feel this was a glorified love story that made a mother and her children suffer because of it. It did want me to seek out the truth and find out the actual occurances, The dresses, housing etc were very interesting,"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Watching this trainwreck for free on television is very different from actually expecting people to pay for it. On television, at first, the main reason to watch was to answer the question, ""Are these two for real?"" .But after a few episodes it was pretty clear that, yes, Lisa and Brittney (especially Lisa, the mother) really are as shallow and self-centered and lazy as it seems--with a tremendous sense of self-importance and entitlement. Why do they feel the world should revolve around them? Will people really pay to see them shop, be rude to each other (and those around them), and try to be the center of attention in all circumstances?When Lisa was recently asked on 20/20 what ""The Gastineau Girls"" was about, she answered, ""Nothing."" That sums it up pretty well."
1,Boring and Useless!,"This has got to be the most boring, unecessary show that was ever on! The mom needs to act her age and stop getting plastic surgery. The daughter, no personality and a brat! How did they get their money again... an old retired football player form way back when? What is so interesting in that! SAVE YOUR MONEY! This show is NOT GOOD!!!"
2,Good video.,This video was okay. It was pretty old-school but if you really like this group it will grow on you.
5,Go and Tell Somebody,"Commissioned's first recording and(still)possibly their best. Anyone who likes the Winans, Williams Bros, Fred Hammond, Marvin Saap or Byron cage will like this CD."
1,Pure junk,I would not use this cellular earbud if they were giving this thing away. Cheaply made with poor sound quality -- spend an extra ten dollars or so for a name brand.
2,Not recommended,"Unless you are the CEO of a company and have total control over implementing a Six Sigma program, I wouldn't recommend this book. It doesn't go much into the meat of Six Sigma, but is focused around developing a Six Sigma culture within your organization. It is also very redundant, repeating the same themes over and over throughout the book. A good editor could have reduced this book to 50 pages. Not recommended."
5,The Deacon,"At the beginning a boy named Nat came to Plum Field. Soon he settled down at the school there. There he met Tommy, John, and Daisy. He and the other boys go through tempers, lies, and dangerous tea party's.By Danielle Rene Larson"
5,None,a splendid book! Love it!. now it's definately sad but it's just too Alcott for it to be too sad.a great book!!
4,I love Jo's Boys!,"At middle age, I am pleased to have discovered Louisa Mae Alcott. I loved the movie Little Women, then went back and read the book. I had to know ""what happened next."" Jo's Boys was just as delightful as Little Women. I really love reading about the Civil War period. I'm now a devoted Alcott fan."
2,Jo's Boys,I got this book as it was the 3rd in the series by Louisa May Alcott. Little Women and Little Men were interesting and I feel she should have stopped there. Jo's Boys are pretty well grown at the beginning of this book and it loses something in the description of places and who is who.That's my opinion.
2,short life span!,"Agree with other reviewers -- steadily replacing these lamps have cost me lots over the years, completely burn out after 4 months on average. Will not accept replacement bulbs -- the whole piece is garbage after that time. Finally gave up and looking for superior product. Plants really come to life being lit from the base -- so hope to find a product that lasts!"
2,Consistent short life,"Had two of these burn out. The first lasted about 2 months and the second about 5 months. As lamps go, that is an unacceptable life span. On the other hand, these are cheap lights made in China so poor quality is almost expected."
4,Meditations for Healing,Wonderful selections. Great for use in Reiki Circles and other groups focused on transformation and healing.
4,very nice for the price,Fans were very easy to install. Nice for bedrooms for the price. Much nicer than fans you may buy at big box stores for about the same price. Gives off very appropriate amount of light for the room. I bought 4 of these for each bedroom in my home and only had to balance one of them. The only thing I may have changed would be that the pull chains come down through the glass globe and you have to make sure they are perfectly lined up.
4,Vygotsky was a man way before his time.,"Educational Psychology was one of Vygotsky's first published, but last translated books. He wrote this book while at Gomel's Teachers College in 1921-23. It was translated into English in 1997. Many believed that Vygotsky wrote this book as an introductory psychology text.It has been said that Vygotsky was a man way before his time. Many of the ideas that Vygotsky formulates are the same issues we are dealing with today. Vygotsky talks about inclusive classrooms, social education, multicultural education, moral education, etc. I found it remarkable that a man in the 1920's was thinking about issues that we are struggling with today.I think this book is a good introduction into Vygotsky and psychology in general. Some parts of the book focus on aspects about psychology that are no longer pertinent today, but I found the history lesson worth while."
3,the color was like red,"when i recieved it, the product was red not really pink either they sent the wrong ones or thats the color its really is"
2,"Yes, I agree - the color was red - earrings were also unequal lengths",I guess I doubted the review and figured why not take a chance for such a small amount of money. I wanted pink coral earrings to match a bracelet and figured if they were red they would match some jewelry with a bit of red coral. I don't think I could wear them because of the unequal lengths of the drop. You do get what you pay for.
3,Okay reference,This was another reference used in the study of the Beatitudes from the Gospel of Matthew. It was little most other references.
4,umm...,"Found this band while searching through the Replacements Tribute album. It's pretty amazing. If you like Leatherface, Jawbreaker, Naked raygun and on and on you would probably love this. I do."
5,Perfect for Curious George lovers,"My kids love this movie. One of the few kids Programs that my husband and I can watch over and over again with out getting annoyed. Very funny, educational, and creative. I highly recommend this movie and any others in the PBS Curious George series."
3,Electronic Workbook,"I purchased this CD-rom at a large discount retailer for about $6.50. That's about how much it's worth. If I had paid more than that, I think I would feel ripped off.The best way to describe ""Vocabulary puzzles, Grade 1"" is as an electronic workbook. It is not really what I would classify as a computer ""game"". The exercises do offer some good reinforcement of basic skills, but I have to sit with my daughter while she uses this program in order to explain/interpret the directions and to help her find the keys on the keyboard. My six-year old is probably ""gifted"" (we homeschool so I really have no clue if she technically is gifted, but teachers I know say that she probably is) who has a pretty long attention span, but even she finds the exercises to be challenging, bordering on monotonous.I wouldn't really classify this disc as ""making learning fun"". It only real use is to make learning electronic and offer a slight variety to filling out workbook pages."
4,Good despite the circumlocution.,"This book would have been a smoother and more entertaining read if Liz had been a gymnast from the start of the story or had gotten into the sport earlier than she did. I endured the first third of the book reading about irrelevant activities such as furniture refinishing, Human Relations term papers, the Table of Truth, and girl get-togethers before gymnastics even came into play.Liz's mother's and sister's attitudes about her gymnastics were annoying. Her sister, who claimed that gymnastics would ruin her love life, had boys on the brain. Her mother, who claimed that gymnastics was an unfeminine sport for social recluses, needed a reality check. But it was gratifying to see them come around at the end of the story.A gymnast's life is realistically depicted, from the excitement of learning new skills to the less pleasant aspects such as twisted ankles and lacerated palms. I recomment it to all gymnastics aficionados or competitive gymnasts."
2,What Was Mr. Frisell Thinking With This One?,"I'm sorry but this album isn't what I expected it to be. This album is the embodiment of anything that's not musical. The reason I'm giving this album 2 stars is for the song ""Wildwood Flower,"" which seems to be the most cohesive song on the album. As another reviewer said, he needs to be in a band context. I think solo guitar excursions like this should be just for fun not on an album. I'm a guitarist and I play around with loops all the time, but I'm just fooling around I'm not making actual songs up. I think the beauty of playing with other musicians is the fact that they'll make your music head in directions that you otherwise wouldn't go in. BILL PLEASE DON'T EVER MAKE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS AGAIN! You're better off with albums like ""Good Dog, Happy Man,"" ""The Willies,"" ""Nashville,"" and ""The Intercontinentals."""
2,Return of the Carter Family,"Nice bit of folk guitar playing here,but who are we kidding when this CD sits in the JAZZ racks? That's where folks like Wes Montgomery and Barney Kessell hang out.See,Jazz has a fair bit to do with improvisation which produces swing.I discern no attempt to do this here. If this is jazz then Maybelle Carter was up there with Joe Pass.She was a great guitar player but she would have laughed in your face if anyone called her music jazz.Be that as it may Bill plays some pretty sounds."
2,Brad Meldau? Not Close,"I bought this cd on the recomendation of someone at amazon.com who compared Bill Frisell with one of the rising stars in jazz today, Brad Meldau.Whomever hade that comparison is either deaf or on the staff of nonsuch music. I suppose that both Bill and Brad are somewhat moody, spacey, and at times deliberate, but after that it's like comparing Bill Evans with Gene Autry. Both the harmonic and thematic content are worlds apart,Brad is a tortured artist while Bill is a lonely schoolboy and compared to the interaction of a live trio (many times in live performance) Bill's repititious tape loops have no interaction at all.This is jazz? This is boring."
4,Another fine Frisell album. Moving further toward acoustic.,"Here's another fine Bill Frisell effort which surpasses, I think, the Costello/Bacharach or ""Good Dog Happy Man"" albums. Frisell continues exploring minimalism here, and he moves further away from the sweeping, chorused electric sounds which characterized his early 90's work. This record focuses more on the acoustic sound which began to creep in with the Buster Keaton albums. What really makes it go are fine melodies within most of the tracks and an adventurous, musical spirit which one can feel (and hear) in the music."
5,Bill's country night ride,"Bill Frissell makes music to listen with, instead of simply to. He's right there listening with you, not worrying about how well he's playing. And he covers so much ground, bridging so much. This CD will ground you in the heart with simple feeling, then pull you out into the night sky. I listened to this CD driving out in the country darkness on a recent summer night, and I was both warmed by the fire with friends and sent off into the woods alone. A great ride."
3,Different... in a good way,"I had never heard of Bill Frisell, but stumbled upon a sampling of ""Wildwood Flower"", which I thought was beautiful. The rest of the cd is haunting and hypnotic, though not bad if you're that kind of mood. Although, it does get a little tiring listening to him play [what sounds like] out of tune. I like the cd, but I don't know if I'd pay any more for it than what I did."
2,Pleasant Enough,"I seem not to be the only one to have bought this via the Brad Mehldau route. Strange connection. This is pleasant enough but no way as intelligent and 'layered' as the jazz sound I was hoping for. Anyone who adored Vini Reilly in the early 80s should pounce on this as a retro novelty. Some tracks hit the nail others 'When I fall in Love' are woeful. A very very hollow sound. As a Brad companion-piece Mark Turner is much more in keeping. Still, Frisell adds to the musical education process."
1,Delivery is terrible!,I still have not received this item. I have had no contact with the company either. My next step is to contact the credit card company and cancel this and report it.
1,Horrible,"This may be the worst thing I've ever watched on television. The story didn't quite make sense and definitely didn't come together at the end. It is not animated as you would guess from the movie title picture. It also goes back and forth between silent film (text in its own frame), subtitles and regular people talking. There was so little about it that was erotic that it would have been more productive to leave the description as psycho. Not worth my $1.99 or my 45 mins, I wish I could get them both back. :-("
3,Social Murder,"THE HANGING IN THE HOTEL by Simon Brett brought to a close my interest in this series. Too much indulgence in the current British social scene and too little exploration of the off beat sleuths that originally made the series so much fun.The Pillars of Sussex, a group of businessmen come off as a bunch of dirty old men who have too little to do with their time and too great an ego to understand they are deadly dull.Even Jude and Carole become infected with the dullness of a lower order social club.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,Can't see the need for a review title but the story was good,"Interesting, entertaining, generally enjoyable. Too much back-tracking for me, especially early on. Original ending!"
2,"An OK mystery, but heavy handed ""satire""","The cover hype promises a comic social satire. What you find inside is a running series of sour, authorial jabs at various aspects of current English middle class culture. The mystery itself is workmanlike, but neither of the dogged pair of sleuths is particularly likeable. All in all, a ho-hum and disappointing read."
5,great studio album,"not as good as American Beauty, but still a good pick. A must have, unless you only like live discs!"
4,There best was before this though this is very good.,I am a big fan of Psychedelic Music of the late 60s. So that being said you know where I am coming from. I am also not a country / folk fan. I'm a Rock & Roll Fan. So that being said I love the Dead from 1965 to 1969 and after that its hit and or miss.I like some of there later songs and some of there live jams.This is an Awesome !!! CD if you are into 60s Psych music.I consider this the Deads best Album right with Aoxomoxoa then Anthem of the Sun then Live Dead in that order there best four Albums.My reaction to Workingman's Dead and American Beauty (Both great Albums if you like that type of music) is this a Rock band? Where are the electric Guitars?Sorry I love the Deads early Rock Music.
5,Revelations Abound,"ALL of the New GD Remasters are pretty great, but the acoustic tracks on this album really stand out. Even if you've heard the album 1000 times as I have this one, you're going to find something you've never heard before. Like it was recorded yesterday. If you don't have HDCD on your CD Player or DVD (most don't offer that feature), you can get it with a soundcard for your computer. It really makes the sound jump out at you. The bonus tracks on this and the other GD Remasters are great as well, and it's nice to see them put the empty space on the CD's to good use. Well worth the money, and a proud addition to my collection."
5,The Best from the Dead,"There is not a flaw on this whole cd. It is all done perfectly and the songs are a pleasure to listen to. The studio tracks like High Time, Black Peter and Easy Wind are classic. Pick this upo the next time you see it, you won't be disappointed."
4,great crock pot,"I'm really enjoying this crock pot. What an easy way to cook! It's a beautiful design, different from typical crock pot look, but it is larger than it looked in photo on screen, but that's not bad, it holds plenty of food that way. Easy to clean, plastic storage lid very useful, can't wait to be able to take it to a pot luck. The programmable function could really be improved upon. I wish I could put in the hours I want at the level I want, instead of it automatically choosing high or low based on the time. I have cooked everything on low, and so far it has taken less time than all the recipies have called for, but the food has been delicious."
2,Worked but....,"The lid did not fit correctly and there was a large gap between the glass lid and the corningware liner...thus, water evaporated from the food and thus we needed to add more water as the food cooked. This cooker is not made by Corningware Electrics, but rather Select Brands, which I feel is pretty misleading. Also, it is listed as a ""programmable"" slow cooker. This is only partially correct: you cannot program it to cook for example for 4 hours at low, it is preset to cook for 1-7 hours on High; and 8-10 hours on Low and then to switch to warm. And finally, it did not come with a cookbook. For 39.99, there are better choices: either a Smartpot from Rival which is a 5 qt machine which is fully programmable Usuallly sells for $30) or I would pony up to the Cuisinart which is a 4 qt fully programmable that sells for $80 or the KitchenAid ($120)which is a 7 qt model."
3,Too hard for the age group specified,"We used Lyrical #3 for homeschool last year for my 3rd & 5th graders. After just 1 section, I dropped it from my 3rd grader's curriculum. The vocabulary is too complex for elementary age children. I do think it is helpful to put these scientific lessons to music, and the illustrations were good, though. I would recommend this for junior high school age children after completing it with my 11 year old."
2,Disappointed,"I only recognized 2 of the songs in this book, it said it was supposed to be familiar folk songs. The main thing I did not like was the reproductive section was way too graphic and descriptive for what I want to present to my children. My kids are ages 13 down to 3 years old, and I really don't want to be singing songs about sperm and male seed swimming together as a sing along. I would rather have had that section removed. I feel like I wasted my money. There were no hands-on activities or experiments. Maybe that is just as well because I don't know what they would have done on the reproductive section for that... :) ! I will not be using this as part of my curriculum."
5,We love them.,The glasses are bigger than what i thought they would be. They are light & do not tip over easily. They are my fav water glass now. They are great & bonus there are made in the USA.
4,SO NICE!,"I like that these are non-breakable, large-capacity cups. They made it through the dishwasher without any damage, and I haven't smelled that plastic smell in my drink if it sits out all day. All in all, I'd get another set if I didn't have so many mugs."
1,cracking up,Loved these when we first got them but as other reviewers are saying these do in fact start to crack on the bottom and begin to leak.I just got them in september and have already lost half of them.so beware!!!!
5,"Looks great, great value","Glasses arrived in 3 days, great packaging, great condition. Glasses are attractive and resilient. With a household full of boys, they are just the ticket."
4,Great for the price!,"We have 6 boys and thus were left with LOTS of broken glasses/mugs and a hodgepodge of set remnants filling our cupboard. These came and work GREAT! They're nice and big (tends to be less spills this way), pretty and D/W safe. They've been dropped several times and have held up - no cracks. We've had them for about 2 months and I plan on ordering another set. I only give 4 stars because I'm not sure how long they'll hold up, but so far so good!"
3,Gets the job done.,"My cats have an affinity for knocking over and shattering glass, so we always use plastic in the house. I really like these tumblers because they are colorful (and so easy to tell who is drinking which cup of water without needing a name tag) and they hold a lot of liquid so they are very utilitarian. The one thing I don't like is that the plastic is fairly thin - plastic cups don't feel weighty in your hand as-is, so this thin design makes the cup feel flimsy, even though it's a sturdy and durable thing. If it were a bit thicker, I think I'd really love these."
2,Not 24 oz. size,"A 24 oz. tumbler is usually 3.75"" diameter by 7.25"" high. It will hold a 16 oz. drink after filling the glass with ice. These tumblers are only 3.5"" diameter by 6.00"" high. If you fill the glass with ice it will not hold a 12 oz. can. Amazon gave me a $15 rebate and let me keep the tumblers so I'm not too unhappy, but I'm trying to replace some of my real 24 oz. tumblers. Note that Creativeware gives the box dimensions not the tumbler dimensions in the description."
5,Love them.,"Love them. I had a set that I got from Sam's but after about 3 or 4 years, most of them had developed little cracks in the bottom and had to be thrown away. I was thrilled to find them on amazon because I just have not found anything else that stacked so well and with a nice flat, wide base for stability. They look great. Given the price, I think that as long as they last me 3 or 4 years, I'm satisfied that I got my money's worth."
4,not so unbreakable.. but really close,"I bought these glasses about 2 years ago and my family and I have used them daily. They are very beautiful, a great size, and NEARLY unbreakable. They have never broken from dropping or other similar activities, but lately a few of them did develop cracks in thier bottoms from the dishwasher. They are supposed to be diswasher safe, and were good until recently. I don't know what changed, but a few of them are cracking in the same spots. Still, we love them so much we are buying a new set. We're very tough on cups and glasses, so glass would never last this long in our house. Ah.. they're worth it."
4,"Great cups, American made",I like these cups. American-made is hard to come by in plastic items! My only gripe is that I got 4 green and zero blue. I would have liked to have some blue ones. I wasn't disgruntled enough to send it back and we are enjoying these and their large capacity. We mainly use them for water consumption and its nice to not worry my kids will break them.
5,creativeware tumblers,"Bought a set last year and love them. Just ordered another set. These are constantly used and run through the dishwasher and they still look great. I wish they had maybe a 16 ounce version for some variety, but we love them!"
4,Love the monkey,Instant hit at six months. Big smiles. It's light and floppy and sturdy--my 10-month-old has been chewing on it for 4 months and it's held up well. The red/white/darkbrown contrast and simple expression are engaging. Definitely a standout from other plush toys.
4,Another Look at Sinclair Lewis,"We all know that a World So Wide was Mr. Lewis's last novel. There have been many biographies on Lewis. A number of them dismiss a World So Wide as just another version of Dodsworth. Yes, there are similarities, but grouping both stories together is misunderstanding what Sinclair Lewis was trying to get at in his last novel. In Dodsworth, Lewis was writing from his brother, Claude's, perspective. In a World So Wide, we get a more personal reflection into Sinclair himself. This last book may be his most personal. . . & final chapter of his life."
3,World So Wide,"World So Wide is about a man named Hayden Chart from Colorado. His wife was killed in an automobile accident. He takes a trip to Italy for the year. While there he meets a woman named Olivia Lomond, Hayden falls in love with her, but another man starts to take Olivia away form him. Hayden trys very hard through out the book to blend in with the Italian society by learning their language and culture.As you read through the book it has very well developed characters, a well developed plot, and it shows you what Italy's culture is like and how they react to tourist. Thought the book it had parts that jump around a little bit and get confusing at times but other than that it is a very good book and flows very nicely."
5,Project Management at the edge.,"We are taught that project management is a sequential discovery process where cost, time and results are traded off as required; when you do not have the time (the Axis powers may get the bomb first) and you have no idea even if it will work but you have to proceed, the management issues are beyond the experience of most of us. The process needed 10,000 tons of copper when there was none to spare, so they ""borrowed"" more than 10,000 tons of silver from the US Treasury and melted it down to wire for the magnets in the separation processing. Every apparent dead end was overcome with staggering and imaginative solutions - it provides a great learning aid for all project managers."
2,anthropology something or other?,"Again, I bought this for my son's schooling. Haha. This came quickly and in great condition. Thank you for the book."
5,Sri has a great talent of clarifying scripture,great advent book.Faithful to Catholic teaching and useful in enriching your appreciation of the incarnation. A great gift for others.
1,Charger does not charge,"This charger does not charge. I liked the design, but when I actually tried to charge my iPhone and iPod it does nothing other than give the appearance it's charging. I understand it was cheap, and may not have worked as quickly or lasted as long, but I would have thought it would have at least worked to some degree."
2,OUCH.,"This book has an okay plot but doesn't fit in with other star wars books. For example: Luke Retires from Commander in the rest of the Star Wars book, Lando doesn't work at Holographic fun world, He works at a gem divers station, Luke would have trained Ken ect. I recommend it to 3rd graders. Mr.Davids if you read this don't get offended because I liked it in 2nd grade and I knew plenty of people who liked it."
5,Star Wars Queen of the empire is fantastic!,"Some people do not like this book because Hologram fun world is not Star Wars enough, but I think that it was a great backround to the story. Also, some people say that this book is not exiting, but I think that the book is full of exitement and suspense. The book is for people up to 12 years old. I personally think it is a book for people of every age. Adults could like it too, it would just have smaller words than they are used to. The picyures are great and the story is great too. I think that this is a great book."
2,Tim's review,"This book wasn't that great. There was not much excitement.The book was about Han and Leia getting married. Leia gets kidnapped by Triocules. He wants her to marry him. Luke, Han, Lando, and Ken switch the real Leia with a droid decoy of Leia. That gives them a chance to escape. I have not read any other books in the series and I probably won't.Someone who likes science fiction would like this book because Star Wars isn't real."
1,DISSAPOINTMENT!!!,"I cried when I read this. Not because it was touching, but because it destroyed Star Wars. This book is NOT Star Wars. It hurt me to see the ""Princess Leia"" in this story. And what in the Force is Hologram Fun World????????? I'mk warning you, this book destroys the Sacred Star Wars."
2,The worst book in the series,"This was most certainly the worst book in this whole series, which wasn't very good to begin with. First of all, they make Leia a weak female, not tough and strong like she usually is, and they turn Luke into a total geek! Han's character is hugely exaggerated, and Chewie might as well not even be there for all the parts he has. The only characters who acted even a little bit like themselves are the droids. The writing is not very good, and the plot is even worse. Why would Han and Leia just take off like that in the middle of an alliance mission meanwhile their friends are wondering where they are or if they're dead or alive? And Hollagram Fun World is just plain silly. This is definity a series for younger kids. I myself enjoyed it when I was younger, but now just about anything else would be better."
4,Good College Text for Struggling Writers,"I teach a college class to students who missed writing/grammar basics in high school. This book does a good job of filling in the gaps. It has a lot more student-oriented activities than I'm used to, but they were very helpful when I sensed the class was losing interest in my lecture. Highly recommended."
2,Boring,"I'm not one of PH biggest fans, but I have few records of them, and I can tell you without hesitation: this is far from being in PH high standards. It's weaker than the marvellous live album with Edmonton symphony orchestra, it's weaker than the great ""Grand hotel"", and it's weaker than the collection albums. Only if you are a die hard fan, you should buy this one, because in general, it is a ""tired"" album done by a tired band, and only ""Pandora's box"", that became a hit, breaks the boredom. Unlike the other albums, that contain only original stuff, here we got 2 cover versions (Eight days a week and Keep forgetting), that are done the uninspired way. ""Without a doubt"" and ""Typewriter torment"" are also not bad, but the average of this album is far under the band's greatest."
5,FABULOUS PHONE,THIS PHONE IS FABULOUS!!! IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES AND BENEFITS I HAD WANTED AND THEN SOME. TWO HANDSETS MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER FOR MULTI-LEVEL LIVING;THE ANSWERING SYSTEM IS GREAT-WE WERE ABLE TO ELIMINATE VOICE MAIL THRU THE PHONE COMPANY AND SAVE $$$. IT HAS TONS OF FUNCTIONS YOU CAN USE OR NOT USE- THE MANUAL IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND THE FUNCTIONS ARE EASY TO SET (OR UNSET). I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO EVERYONE WHO NEEDED A NEW PHONE!!!
5,"...It's a good phone, really....","yes, I'm a kid! so what?! I have an influence on the scores...I think...any who, It's a good phone, really it is. good qualities:.takes up small space.light-weight.good looking (my opinion).and its just plain goodbad qualities *ooooooooh*:.i wish that the talk botton was bigger and a different color form the end botton, the 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 bottons, etc.thats pretty much it!Riann's review! :) (sideways smiley face. c'mon look at it)"
5,And it has the ability to Share Phonebooks!,This phone has worked very well for me and my partner. Inevitably there always seems to be one person out of two that is slightly more technologically challenged. The answering machine portion is very simple to use and explain. The best feature of this phone that I've found is that you can share the programmed phonebook from one hand-set to the other. I only had to enter in one set of pre-programmed numbers and then transfer it to the other device. Made my life much easier.
2,Strange Fruit is strange indeed,"Unfortunately, I picked this book up by accident in the library. I can accept that Smith is a product of her time, but the content of this book is based on romantic myths about black culture. Of course Nonnie is happy she is having this white man's child, in the white male hierearchal system that we live in it is romanticized that all black women, and black people in general, want to claim what is white. This story is about Nonnie and how horribly mixed up she is. Why on earth would she return to Maxwell to chase after someone else's child when she has a college degree? She does have other options. I am sorry, but this book is sub-par at best."
5,LIVE LIFE TO IT'S FULLEST,"Getting There With Grace is truly a map that guides one through the perils and pleasures of life. It helps us accept the things we have done wrong and cannot change, and to look forward to a confident and serene future, regardless of your age."
4,great value,"very good compilation of reggae from mid 70's to early 80's. theres vocal groups (Meditations,Gaylads and the Royals) all with great rythems and good lyrics. Early 80's dancehall stuff from the likes of Chaplin,Carlos and Reid plus a bit of lovers from Earl 16.Prince Fari sings ""You know a rude boy by the way he walks"" from his survival album, its a good album for a great price, My favourite track is jarretts ""Sleeping in the park"""
5,Integrated Cardiopulmonary Pharmacology,"I think Colbert and Mason have done a great job with a text that is typically student ""unfriendly"". I am using it for the first time with a class and students are actually reading the chapters! Other text lose students with terminology and tend to get bogged down in the biochemistry of pharmacolgy losing site of when and how the drugs should be used. The students love the web site and use it to further challenge themselves."
2,Student-friendly language with errors and omissions,Good for respiratory therapy students- not useful for students in pharmacy or medicine. Too many incorrect statements and important omissions. Very superficial coverage of non-pulmonary topics.
4,light weight flash for Olympus camera,This is a light weight flash unit for Olympus cameras. It works as advertised to add more shooting distance over the camera's build-in flash. I bought this one because my Olympus digital camera is also light weight. It would be ridiculous to drag along a large flash unit that's bigger than the camera itself!
1,Olympus FL-20 Electronic,It really does juat a little bit better than the on board and adds weight to the camera. I really do not think it is a great buy
2,awful and awesome,"The Light in the Forest is very sad. It's sad because it tells the story of the uncompromising conflict of ideologies between the English settlers and their Native American contemporaries. I watched the Disney movie first, which, though a bit cheesy, is lovable in its own way. The book was completely different. No happy ending, no romance, no love. Especially the chapter where True Son meets his relatives just seethes with hatred. I felt like Richter had tried to portray a fair picture of the wrong on both sides--although history may be forever ambiguous on that point--, but as such, the book makes for some pretty depressing material. The one redeeming factor, however, is its incredible portrayal of the Ohio wilderness. Richter's love for and appreciation of his homeland shine forth in lyrical truth that is not quickly forgotten. The book ends rather abruptly; reading its companion volume, A Country of Strangers, helps tie up the loose ends."
3,light in the forst,"The Light in the Forest is a book that gives a setting in Delaware boy is found in a tribe of Indians. He was 4 when they found him. Later we go to his current age he is 15 and he is a wild boy so to speek.The main characters are True Son/John, Half Arrow,Little Crane,his Mom, Dad, Brothers and Sister Delhardey,and his Indian father Cuyloga. The rising attraction is when they try to take him to his dad but he thinks he is an Indian. So when they try to take him to his real dad but he runs away and rebels. The climax starts when he finds out he is white he goes in a river and realizes he is a white boy. Then the falling attraction starts when he goes to his dad. Then he goes to his Indian dad and hi dad banishes him. Then he leaves looks back but the Indian."
3,"Good book, bad book","This book was a good book, but it got very boring at parts. It was very dull and it jumped around. Some parts did get exciting, but not to good. I would recomend this book if you like reading about Indian stories. It is about a naturally white boy who got taken in by an Indian family. After about 10 years he had to go back to his real parents. The book was Ok, but i found it rather boring"
3,not...COMPLETE...torture,"I love reading, especially historical fiction, but, I think this book would have been more interesting if it hadn't been first written so long ago. I found a lot of the dialog and wording very hard to understand, and I'm a straight ""A"" student. Most of the book was very dull and poorly written, but at least a third of it had some interesting ""action"" or something in it. I had to read this book for school, and it wasn't complete torture, but it was pretty bad. I wouldn't suggest buying this book or reading any other works of Conrad Richter."
4,The Light In The Forest,"The Light In the Forest is a story writen by the author Conrad Richter. ""The Light In The Forest"" represents a white boy living amongst the forest with the Indians. His white name is John Butler, but his Indian name is True son. He was left in the forest by accident by his real father and was adopted by the Indians, and he learned how to libe by their ways. That the white men were the enemy's. As he got older around the age of 15, he returned to the white people. This story is about him having to deal with returning to the white people, and how he react to it and in the end, and where he goes."
4,ok book,The Light In The Forest is a goood book that really deserves a good 4 stars because of the suffering that True Son went through in the story.when True Son was taken by the indian called Cuyloga little did the kid know was that later he would be confuse which kind did he belong to the white or the indians.This bookreally got to me because this kind of things happen to kids and adults in every day life.
4,A very nice book,"The Light In The Forest, though dull at points is a very personal, very emotional book. A young boy, taken from his people at a very young age, is returned. He has been taught to hate all whites however and rebels from their ways. Escaping back to his people, a huge mistake sends him alone, with both sides hating him. Very good book, I'd reccommend it to most people."
1,The worst book ever,This book was so boring and everybody in my LA class hated it. It was so full of violence and hatred. I really don't want to read about that. True Son acted like a five year old but he was really fifteen. I'd much rather read Harry Potter books.
1,HORRIBLE,"i'm a middle school student, and as a part of the cirriculm we were to read The Light in the Forest. me, along with all of my classmates agreed that it was honestly a waste of time. we all were bored to death, and considering its a book from the 50's, it really shouldn't be in a cirriculum of 2004 or any year as a matter of fact. as john said, if this book were alive, i'd kill it. no offence to mr. richter, but we all hated it."
2,Boring. Boring. Boring!,"I was supposed to read this book and write an alternate ending for school! It's one of the worst stories ever!I hated the figurative language! ( Like the wind is my brother-in-law) It was boring and weird. But, at the end it did make me cry because I felt bad for John/ True Son. Don't read this book unless you like wasting time!"
1,Horribly dull book that does nothing but drag on and on,"Probably one the most boring and meaningless stories I have ever read. It's just a childish fight between Indians and White Men that in the end proves nothing. If you wanna hear about Indians scalping white men and white men hunting down and shooting Indians, then for sure, read this book. Its about a white boy who was kidnapped by Indians when he was a baby and then raised by those Indians. Then he is forced to return to live with his white family and hates them, thus resulting in scalping, hate, depression. Those are usually things that make a book good, but in this case, they tear it down and kill it."
1,Absolutely Horrendous,"The Light in the Forest was the worst book I have ever read. The book is boring and wordy and the lack of action is unacceptable. I had to read this book for class and I barely had the patience to get past the first page, let alone the entire book. I would reccomend this book only to Seven Years War afficienados with nothing better to do!"
1,The light sort of burned out in this story...,"Good Lord! This incredibly horrendous book could possibly win the Darwin Award for Literature. I was forced to read this horrible book in my eighth grade advanced english class and fell asleep several times trying to get to the end. I spent the entire book waiting for something happend, and then finally when i reached the end, none of the problems that had been created throughout the book were solved. I truely pity you if you are foced to read this book, but if you WANT to read it you must be out of your mind!"
3,Who's (his) daddy?,"Identity issues 1950s style, this YA story takes up the life of True Son, a white boy captured by Indians as a toddler and raised by them as one of their own for some eleven years. True Son is forcibly reunited with his white family, but has completely identified with his Indian family and tribe. The story largely revolves around his rather difficult reunion with his birth family, his resistance to their way, and his desire to return to the Indian tribe and world. I found some pleasure in the tension of whether birth or upbringing determines who a person is throughout the book and ending, but in spite of Richter's fine writing, found the book tedious at times and addressing the central issues in ways that felt dated. It's worth a fast read, but not an ovation."
4,a light...,I just read this with my children. My opinion of this book is positive in that it didn't have a predictable ending and the author didn't present a one sided conversation. It is a well rounded book with points of view from indian to settlers. About midway it did start to sound a bit like it might be going the way of propaganda but straighten up immediately. I recommend for all readers. There is some graphic details about killings so parents would need to monitor for age appropriation.
4,Self-discovery,"Good story of a young boy, True Son, who is struggles with self-discovery. Interesting and unexpected ending. Great discussions with middle school students."
3,My Opinions Of The Story,"The book ""The Light In The Forest"" was an interesting story about a young white boy who was adopted by native indians.I thought that the book was similar to everyday life.Except at the end of the story the young child is turned away from his own step father.The white parents of the child return for him and fight for the right of being his parents again.But it is too late for the child ""John"" has already grew acustom to the indians way of life and living ways.This book did have some action events in it which took place in the forest.There for my opinion on this book gets three stars.Honestly I wouldnt mind reading it again."
4,The Light In The Forest,The Light In The Forest based upon a fifteen year old white boy that was adopted at a young age by Indians therefore got his mind frame to think men was supposeto do manly work rather than write in a journel. He was force to move back with the white people but felt he didn't belong with the new family or his new home. They wanted him to change and to be more like them. All he can think about is that he missed his home with the Indians.
3,Great Story... Too Plain,"The Light in the Forest is a very good yarn about a boy's conflict with his heritage. On the whole, I enjoyed the book, (...) and elaborate more on the action of the story. The emotion of the book flowed very well, and the characters were believeable. The setting, however, seemed distant and unimportant.I normally read science fiction, but this book is a nice break from that fantasy world. All in all, a good book."
3,The light of the forest,This book was very interesting.I don't like read books but this made me want to read it.But I really enjoy reading this.I wouldn't mind buying this book abnd add this to my collection.
4,the light in the forest,The book The Light In The Forest is based upon a young white boy who at the age of four was taken by indians.And who was brought up as a indian till the age of ten. The young boys indian name was True Son and his white name was John Butter. When he was about fifteen he was forced to be sent back with his white family. Which True Son refused but was sent anyways. At first when he arrived he was uncomfortable and tried to escape.But after all the getting use to he began to feel as if he was with the indians. But later escapes anyway when he meets his old indian friend. True Son must choose which family he should spend his life with and which family is best for him. I enjoyed the book very much. It was very interesting because it was based upon what happens in reality and that is what makes the book more enjoyable to myself.
4,light in the forest,"this book waz a great interesting boook to read for people of all age, its a book that i enjoyed read in class and i know if you read this book you going to like it .The light in the forest is intresting story about a boy that lost his indian and his has to go live with his real father and he don't like it there and the end of the this book is going to suprise you ."
3,Light in The Forest,"The Light in The Forest is an interesting and very powerful story of a young frontiner boy who was brought up to be a warrior.Taken from his parents at a very young age True Son who's real name is John Butler was raised and taught the ways of the Indians.When it comes his time to return back to his white family, True Son finds out that he is caught on the boarder line between two different worlds. Mastering everything about the Indian culture , True Son finds it difficult to return back to his life to live as a frontiner boy.Light in The Forest tells about a boy who has learned the challange of manhood and the love for Indian."
2,A Disappointment,"I was expecting a summary, an analysis along with lists of characters and descriptions of them. Instead there were simple graphic organizers that were not as good as those which I could make myself. I teach students with learning disabilities and they need high level content with low vocabulary material. This did not do it for them, and I would not use it for any students in lower grades either. Perhaps it is good to learn from regarding how to make a graphic organizer, but any teacher who does not always know how to make one will not find this one very helpful. It was not worth the money that I paid for it."
1,please spare youself from this book if posible,"No matter what you think this is not a good book in our opinion. Yea, it may have so well written sentenses. It is mind-numbingly boring and pointless. Well, maybe not pointess but deffinently boring. The reason it is not pointless is because it does have soom what of a plot; which is, a boy who is tangled between two caltures. The worst part of the book to use is that he is shuned out of those two caltures at the end which makes the book disapointing to the reader and the author. The author probely would not care because he is dead. If you like indian storys you might like this, even though it has been done a million times before, if not don't even bother with it.This book is not what you should spend you summer on, but if you have to than make the best of it."
1,ThIs BoOk StUnK!!!!!!!!,"This book was the worst book i have ever read in my whole entire life!!!!! i cant believe i actually wasted my time!!! i had to read it for school, and i cant believe i even lived through reading it!!! I hated this book ssssoooooo much that i can barely even look at it!! It was sooooooooooo BORING!!! It made no sense!! And what kind of name is TRUE SON!!! This book was like scattered, meaning that it was all mixed up! I still cant believe i even wasted my time reading it!!! i regret it tooooooo toooo toooo much!! And by the way~~ if no stars was a choice, i would without a doubt choose that one!!!!!!!!"
1,you'll fall asleep,This book is the kind your teacher will force you to read and it takes all your willpower to suffer through this book. The sentences seem to drag on forever and it is very confusing. There are no colorful verbs that make you picture the setting and makes you feel like you are there. Instead of the great enjoyment you usually get out of reading a book this boring book makes you feel like you are reading it as a punishment. I would suggest this book to someone who has a hard time falling asleep because while reading this book you'll be out like a light. Save yourself from the pain and suffering by NOT READING THIS BOOK.
1,this book is bad,i seriosly dislike this book. it is really really boring. im a very big fan of reading and i still don't like this book. do not read this book (too bad they didn't finish scalping Johnny's uncle)
2,great book if you love to hate,"I give the book 2 stars for being well written, but that's it. If you want to read something that encourages the sterotype that all white people are awful and the worst of the lot are white Christians than this is your book."
2,The Light in the Forest,"This piece of literature, entitled The Light in the Forest, was poorly written. I think the author was drowsy when he wrote this book. My opinion is that there were too many Indian names and obscure words, the author used sluggish style. The sentences were too drawn out and monotonous. I do not like Conrad Richard's style. Others, however, may like this stuffy, stale book. On a scale of one to ten, I've concluded that this book deserves a two and a half. It's plot, however, did have potential. Another author could have possibly made this book worth reading."
4,What I think about this book,I think that the book was a good book (exept for the scalping). It was very interesting. It had lots of Information about how the indians lived and what they had to do or be forced to do to please the white people
2,Why we did not like The Light in the Forest,"The Light in the Forest should not be recommended to middle schoolers because the author hangs on to each subject too much. For example, when True Son and his dad were down at the river, the author focused too much on their conversation. He should have consentrated more on the feelings True Son was experiencing. Another example is when True Son's father was bringing him back to his biological parents. The book had a entire chapter describing the journey to the camp. Focusing more on being at the camp would have been more interesting. As one can see, focusing too much on the small details makes it difficult for middle schoolers to follow."
3,The Light in the Forest that Burned Out,"The Light in the Forest by Conrad Richter was not a fullfilling book because there was no closure to the book. For example, True Son was coming back to his biological family then the book ended, and it left the reader hanging. I wondered what was going to happen to True Son. Would his family reject him? Would they take him back and forgive him for running away and scalping his uncle? How would True Son's Indian family react to the situation? In conclusion, this book lacked a good closure."
2,The worst book I have ever been made to read.,This book was so boring. It went on and on and on about how the whites didn't like the Indians. It stunk like...... it just stunk.
5,One of the best books I have read.,I've read this book several times since I was in grade school (over 30 years ago) and I find it an inspiring and moving book each time I read it. This book also introduced me to many other of Conrad Richter's fine short novels.
3,"An *Okay* book, but could have been better","The Light in the Forest was a very intersting book. Once i saw the cover, i knew it was *easy-reading*. I believe that Conrad Richter could have written this book better, although I did like the characters including, True Son, Half Arrow, Culoga, and the rest of the Lenne Lenape Tribe. The situation in this novel had a very heavy tone, although i felt it was written very lightly. If you like books about Native Americans then this book would be alright w/ you"
3,The Collision,In this story there was an indian boy by the name of trueson 'who was really white'. At the age of 4 he was adopted by a indian tribe which he grew to really love. The tribe at one point was forced to release all the whites they had. since Trueson was one of them he had to be set free. he had to start all over with a family he didn't know. He ends up with no family because they abanded him
5,A Classic Based On America's Early History,"Like many, I first read this ages ago in school. Its not really meant to be a kids book, but is used to bridge readers into more sophisticated fare. Who knows what they are reading now in school. Depending on the teacher, the themes of this book might be lost on younger readers, especially those brought up on Dick & Jane. The book was before its time, when talking about the plight of the natives was still unheard of. Even these generations know little about ancient America and the millions who lived here for thousands of years. Light in the Forest is one tale of many based on the clash of those two civlizations where one prevailed and the old one died. For more on the history behind this novel, try1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,The Founders of AmericaandIndians in Pennsylvania."
4,"""Sleeper"" books",I remembered this book from when I was a young boy and I thought it would be a good book for my grandson to read. He is 12 and really liked it. It does not end as one would expect which makes it all the more interesting. I highly recommend it for young readers.
4,The Light in the Forest 1953,"Plot Kernel - A 15 year old boy, who had been captured at age 4 by Delaware Indians is returned along with other white captives to Fort Pitt to be reunited with his family. The boy, named True Son by his adoptive Indian father, considers himself to be an Indian, and feels his return to white civilization is a captivity by whites. Despising the ways of white culture, he thinks only of returning to his Indian family. Eventually, with the help of his Indian cousin he is able to escape. But in the end he finds a conflict of values he cannot resolve."
1,whos being discriminated here again?,"Well, if you love to: torture, murder, stab, punch, shoot, kill, cut, or inflict pain in anyway on yourself, THIS BOOK CAN HELP! if you're like me, you'll put down the stupid book burn it and then scatter the ashes over an indian grave. it because its so bad. the only people who think that this would be a good bok whatsoever would be the stupid english teachers. haven't you noticed how they always say that they love a certain book or genre, and then like EVERYBODY thinks that they're wrong? yea well here's another example. i mean also if you think about it, all of the people in the education industry are racist to themselves because they just LOVE to beat up on your on own culture. especially since they're like ""oh yea, the indians are so great and have such peaceful minds"" even though they dont even know what a stupid light bulb is. they are so advanced that they're not. woah."
1,SUCKS!!!!!,my name is austin.I live in Texas and my L.A. teacher made us read this boring book. It is probably the most worst book I have ever read.i skipped 5 chapters because of this book's suckinessDO NOT READ THIS DISCRASE TO ALL BOOKS. U WILL BE WASTING YOUR LIFE. I really came here to find answers about the book because i have not turned it in yet. its due tomorrow.
2,Very boring and confusing,"This book was boring and confusing and dragged on. In the begginning you don't have clue one what is going on because it flips points of view between True Son and a soldier. When he is at his families home, the book just drags on. The ending was so predictible too. So I really don't reccommend this title."
2,The Light in the Forest has Burned Out.,"The book The Light in the Forest, by Conrad Richter, is not a good book to read becasue it was very predictable. For instance, when true son went back to the village one could already tell that he was going to be sent back to the white people. Also, in the beginning of the book when Half Arrow was marching with True Son, one could that Half Arrow would have to leave after they crossed the river."
2,Beware of word content,"I purchased this book for my son's fifth grade reading assignment. This book wouldn't be a book I would have purchased for my son without it being mandatory. I felt that the story line of the book was good, but I had a problem with some of the language that was used in the book, specifically on page 63. It contained the use of G*d D**n five times. I don't beleive that kind of language is profitable to anyone of any age."
1,Waste of Time,"This book was a waste of time. Its plot was not very interesting. It was about a tribe of Indians who are forced to give up their ""adopted"" white son. The son then goes on to live with his real white family for several months, before escaping and returning to his Indian village and Indian family. At the end the Indians no longer accept him, and neither do the whites. Not very captivating is it? The book would be better if the characters had been more developed. Also, the author should have made the book more exciting and eventful. I'm telling you, if it wasn't assigned I wouldn't have read it. I don't think middle schoolers would like this book any more than I did."
1,Is Light in the Forest a good book,It was no action in the book or excitement in it.But when you get reading it gets a little good.
3,"Ultimately, True Son can only be true to the white race.","Though, geared toward adolescents, Ricter's novel contains adult themes and is an excellent introduction to stereotypical racial prejudices. Disappointingly, Richter choses not to take a stand, instead pointing out faults and strengths of both European Americans and Native Americans. The ending of the book, contradicts the title as True Son betrays his Indian relatives. Still, Richter wants the reader to know there is still hope to bridge the racial divide; there is still ""light in the forest.&quot"
3,Review for a Light in the Forest,"I thought that this was a pretty good book I had to read it for school in 7th grade. The people who wrote the other reviews helped me out with my homework. I thought the way the story ended was bad but oh well who cares.LaurenAustin, Texas"
3,Short But Sweet,"The Light in the Forest is a Short, but descriptive book about John Butler's life as a white boy raised an Indian. John butler aka True Son struggles to live like the white man after he is told he must be returned to his real parents. The ending of The light in the Forest is quite a shock when True Son and his Indian Father Cuyloga split ways and True Son is never to return.Although short this book was very enjoyable and I recommend it for any one that wants a good book."
3,A good Book,"Was this book based on a true story? It was very realistic. The way he was raised by Indians and grew up to hate his on race was really weird. I dont think he really got to liking himself for that. At the end he was disowned by both, the Indiands and his own family, for being more than he is(Indian and White)."
1,it was terrible,"I dislikeThe light in the Forest by Conrad Richter. The book is a bad example of how the Indians and the white people got along. Some of the Indians were very hostile toward the white men. But,some Indians were very nice to the white men. I didn't like the book because it sends wrong messages about how things were back then. Because there were more white men that picked on Indians than vice versa. I feel the book was not very well written, I feel that if the author had researche Indians more he would have written a better book and made it sound more real. I would not recommend this book for anyone because it was not well written it didn't have any details as to why the white men wanted John back. The Light in the Forest is the worst book i've ever read."
1,Ms. Pronowitz WHY OH WHY???,"This book was very bad. It started off with a plot that fell apart with the boring yet meaningful(yeah right) Indian culture. True Son definately thought to himself way too much in this book{readers rather read action or dialogue instead of thoughts} and it would have never happened. I think that whoever reads this or is planning on reading it should read it quick to get it over with. Also, don't worry, the test is not hard."
1,This book is boring and unmeaningful.,"The light in the forest, was incredibly boring until the middle/end where it got SLIGHTLY good. But the ending was very bad, so bad that I threw it across the room, and wanted to burn the book, in disgust. Also, I don't understand why they have middle/high school children reading this book, because the book has the word scalping, or something to that effect,every other word. It is so REPULSIVE. I do not recommend this book to any one. If you must read it I suggest that you don't if are a girl. Guys would probably love the graphic violence in some parts of the book. Please do not waste your time on this book, even though it is short."
3,The Light in The Forest,"The Light in The Forset is an interesting book about a white boy who is captured at a young age by the Lenni Lenape Indians. Cuyloga,True Son's adoptive father,teaches him everything he needs to know. After many years with the indians,the whitepeople demand all white captives back. True Son goes back to his real family.He doesn't like it with his real family, so he escapes when they tell him that TRue Son's uncle has killed a indian. At the end TRue Son is betrayed and almost killed."
2,The Light in the Forest,"The Light in the Forest had a good plot, but lacked the action that would have made it a great book. The book wasn't terrible, but not something a young reader would expect. This book was about a boy adopted by indians at the age of four. He took to the ways of the indians, and was considered one by the other members of the tribe. At age fourteen, the boy was forced to return to his true family on the American frontier. We liked the story, but thought it moved slowly. The ending was not something we expected, and was disappointing. We rated this book two stars because it was an okay book, but never caught our attention."
3,Two reviews by different people,"Conrad Richter's book, The Light in the Forest was a really bad book. It was boring and lacked excitement and a good plot. The main thing that bothered me was that you couldn't read almost every other word! No one in seventh grade, or any other for that matter, should read this book.The Light in the Forest, by Conrad Richter, was a fairly good book. Although our interest waned a few times, the characters were interesting to stay with the book. Although drawn out at times, it had a rewarding and unpredictable ending. It had an endearing protagonist and we liked it and give The light in the Forest 4 stars!"
2,upside down and backwards,"The book is printed upside down and backwards. Nice cover though, seems high quality And its a great story. Too bad it was printed that way."
3,soooooooooo sad,This book was so sad! So many sad things were happening and you would think that in the end everything would even out but nooooooo. They just ended the book with the saddest ending that I have ever seen! My heart is still crying right now! This book was sad!
2,super duper excellent,i think this book was really good but what i really learned about it was that you shouidn't be so selective because i know i will be really happy to live with my own parents.
4,The rapping up excitment of what many people had to face.,"I have to admit I was dismayed by the bad remarks given by this book. Although I read it a few years ago I remember it being wonderful and exciting. This is a wonderful book for those interested in American history, historical fiction, or indians. I would not rule out this book. And as one person said that the book was all thoughts not action, thoughts are what make it so you can relate to the book and makes it more personal not to mention that's how you get to know the characters."
4,I think The light In the Forest was a great book.,I thought that the book the light in the forest is great. It teaches you about the White people and hte Indian people. It shows the point of view of both type of people.
5,Beautifully told.,"Deservedly a classic, ""The Light in the Forest"" continues to stand out as a novel for young readers and lovers of history alike. Told in Conrad Richter's simple but poetic prose style, the book chronicles a white boy's struggle to readjust to his family after being raised by Indians in the early days of the American Republic. Richter's ability to tell several sides of a story at once enable us feel the pain of both True Son and his families. A wonderful book by a great American writer."
3,A good book for young readers!,"I thought that The Light In The Forest is an excellent choice for young readers. It takes you back into the 1700's when a white child at 4, is taken by the Indians and raised in the Indian culture. But at the age of 15, the boy has to be returned to his white family. True Son, the boy, is very unhappy about having to return. He hates his white family, his new house, and the white way of life. I give the book 3 stars because it has a poor ending."
4,Clarity itself,"I confess I often find military history very hard to follow with all those ridges, flanks, obstacles and maps that never seem to correspond to what you are reading. This book is clarity itself and explains the campaigns from a number of points of view, giving clear assessments, which one can agree or disagree with, but will surely respect as having been made thoughtfully. An admirable little book."
4,good detail on the overall campaign,"Very little info on the actual battles that were fought. Instead there are details of the overall campaign. Good info about decisions the generals and the problems that they faced with their staffs'. Also good information about logistics in the campaign. Very good book, wonderful read."
5,Excellent concise summary of the Atlanta campaign,"I will not go into as much detail as some previous reviews as they have already said much of what I would say and probably better, but this is remarkable read on the Atlanta campaign. You will not a find detailed blow by blow battle description here but a larger view of the difficulties and advantages and that each general possessed. Mr. McMurry also provides what I believe to be a mostly fair critique of all generals involved stressing both strengths and short comings. I would recommend this book for any interested in the Atlanta campaign, especially for those looking for an introduction before taking on a more detailed account or for someone who may lose focus with some of the larger more detailed histories."
2,Not what I wanted.,"I had hoped to save time peeling onions for the holidays, but I guess that's not so easy to do. These were tasteless, and the consensus of my guests was, ""don't buy them again."" I would try other Haywards' products, however, because they are bound to have a winner there somewhere."
5,Zwiling Henckels Grooming Kit,"I got this for my dad for a Christmas present. He loves it, the quality is great. I searched for hours trying to pick out the right set. This is definitely one of the more expense grooming kits but so far, no complaints. The day he got it, my brother actually used the nail clippers to trim his dogs claws. The clippers handled to task without any problem. The case is nice and compact and makes for easy traveling."
5,well made and beatiful,I absolutely love this chairs they are well made no missing peaces beautifully designed they came well packed and are easy to assemble I will be buying from them again
5,Nice sturdy chairs,The chairs look great and are very sturdy. They were quite easy to assemble. Great value for price and style.
4,"Affordable, stylish dining chairs for the budget challenged","If you are looking for dining chairs that combine function and great style for an excellent price, order these chairs. I just finished putting them together and they look great. As a starving college student, who also happens to be a new home owner, my funds are very limited. These chairs are not as substantial as more expensive chairs, but they seem quite sturdy. I highly recommend them for the person starting out who needs to stretch their dollar."
4,They look nice,"Three of the four chairs I bought are wobbly because the holes didn't fit together well. This also meant it took me about 3 hours to put them all together, but I'm not too coordinated in this area. The box was damaged during shipping, so one of the chairs was scratched. The cushion part is very firm, which could be good or bad, depending on your preferences.Overall, they look beautiful and they match my table and couches perfectly. For the price, I can't really complain too much."
1,CAN'T COMMENT - HAVEN'T RECEIVED PRODUCT YET...,"I have been so looking forward to receiving these Items but even though I placed my order on February 1st, I still haven't received them. Then today I get an e-mail saying that ONE of the (set of 2) chairs has been shipped. No mention of when I can expect the second chair (of a set of TWO) to be shipped. I have to say that I am disappointed they are not here yet..."
5,Very pleased with product...not so much with excessive shipping costs,"These chairs are of good quality, easy to assemble, and sturdy. I am happy with the chairs, however felt the $23 in shipping costs was a bit much considering it wasn't that large of a package and the costs were higher than other items ordered from other vendors that were much heavier. I would prefer to have the cost of the items reflect a competitive price and have the shipping more reasonable then having the cost of the item quite low but the shipping costs excessive."
1,Low Quality,"Got chairs , fixed them looked very delicate . And that it.Two of them already broke. The BACK top breaks if chair fell ( it falls any way because of its balance )."
4,Great chairs!,"For the price, I was expecting far lower quality. They are very attractive and well made. They aren't very comfortable - they aren't uncomfortable by any means, but not the kind of chair you want to linger in. Delivery was very fast."
3,Dining Chair,Chairs were deliver in timely manner. Howevre they looked good in picture but I was disappointed that how small they are. Picture is decieving. May be these chairs are OK for a small appartment. But I won't recommend if you are buying for your home.
4,Coaster chairs,Reasonable quality chairs for price. The assembly instruction could have been little better to make life easier. Overall in nice buy.
4,Great for the money!,"We purchased these for our kitchen table, and the reviews were spot on. A great, stylish chair and good value for the money. It's definitely not a high quality item, so don't expect solid wood. However, the chairs are sturdy, stylish, and easy to assemble. I believe the first set of two took us about 30 minutes to set up (plus another 20 just to open the package!), then the second one we had opened and set up within 15 - 20 minutes."
3,Coaster Chairs,The chairs are actually very well done but the product was received with a broken back section...I am trying to get a new back section sent to me.
5,great chair,great chair for the price and very comfortable. delivery came on time and it was easy to put together.it a great looking chair
2,Too small! Coaster chairs,"These chairs are o.k. but ridiculously small! I would send back but? always a hassle. I am 5 4"" 120 lb. and anyone much larger than myself would not be very comfortable. I bought them to go with my 2 Ikea chairs and table, but now wish I made the long drive to Ikea to get more of their comfy chairs!"
4,Microfiber modern dining chairs,Chairs were as described. They went together quickly (we ordered 2 sets of 2) and they suit our light use purposes. One arrived broken but was replaced by vendor.
5,Small but sturdy,Seem Sturdy enough small chair as we needed match bar stools in same area and they have been good thats why we ordered them. easy to assemble and came via UPS quickly
4,Jmc,"This is a good product for the money. It does take a little effort to put them together, but for the money well worth it. The chairs are not high quality furniture, but great for extra chairs and those on a budget."
4,"Product is sturdy and easy to set up, just not sure I like the cushion fabric","I purchased this product to match a small kitchen table and they do match. The chairs are sturdy and easy to set up as far as wooden chairs go. The 4 stars instead of 5 stars is a result of the fabric used for the cushions. I'm not sure that I like the fabric.. it's a bit cheap, stiff and rough. It's a good thing that it's not too hard to get covers."
4,My all-time favorite,"Out of any Commissioned CD, this is by far my favorite. No other album they've made has dethroned this one. However, Commissioned Reunion is slowly taking its place. This was a breakout album for them and probably is the only album I know word for word. The funny part is I haven't heard the album in a couple of years."
4,good songwriting,best work by this songwriter to date. I thought 'rooms too cold' was kinda boring. this is a very relaxed attitude. a good long disc too. if you like starylight run this is similar.
3,pyrometer,bought this pyrometer to replace the exact same device which stopped working properly after less than two years. Hope this one lasts longer.
2,Season 10 Time for intermission,"After perhaps one of the best seasons ever, Season 9, SG-1 Season 10 became such a disappointment to me upon viewing it. What a bomb! While I understood all the niceities of the series being pulled by Sci-Fi Networkthat was really no reason to loll out on the episodes which seemed to be more narratives on back slapping and teary eyed moping about than about maintaining the excellent storyline continued over from Season 9.Oh I see, Of course, THERE WERE GOING TO BE DVDS to follow and to maintain the continuity. EXCUSE ME! I think the continuity got lost when the fish jumped out of Jack's pond!"
3,OK But not happy,"The format theyused for the DVD could have been done better. Alot of the episodes start with,""Previously"", yet those shows aren't included. So it left me feeling cheated."
2,Should Have Been Better,"This is a great series and deserved a better final season. Too many episodes were filler and inconsequential. And the last episode was a time dilation episode so it really didn't count, for which they have a too great fondness. Every ""what if"" episode lacks much imagination and they keep up their affinity for killing off races and illogical plot twists. I have been a fan for all ten seasons and I wish they would have spent more season ten episodes on SG1 and characters and plots of consequence."
4,Wistful that a great series is ending.,"The series was getting to seem a bit long in the tooth but features solid writing, great characters and the usual stellar production values. I'll of course own this DVD and will continue to enjoy the series, a fine blend of pulp sci fi and space opera that always surprised, entertained and will never get old. I'm glad to see that the story lines will hopefully be wrapped in the movies to come. I look forward to a more focused writing team for future SG Atlantis seasons and some interesting evolution's of SG in the future."
2,Terrible episode 11 is missing on Prime why?,"Really? The Quest, Part 2 [HD] is missing wtf gives Amazon get your shit together, enough with this fail changes hurry and fix it I am bored!"
3,It was time,"It was a great series since it's early days on showtime. Some plots were becoming repetitive. Even with new characters it was time. Of this last season I really only like 2-3 episodes. But if you have the entire series already, it's the completion."
4,Pissed!,"C'mon you got to be kidding me! I really felt the Asgard, of all the races on the show, should not have been the ones to get killed off the show. They were my favorite! I believe they had so much to offer.Im glad its over because I couldnt watch any future episodes without the Asgard there to help out.Thor is the man! Im gonna miss those guys. Kewl finale though."
5,Awesome,"It's SG-1.Another season from the franchise. Towards the end of the series, but definitely worthwhile to watch. If you've gotten this far, it's a shame to not finish it off."
4,A real sleeper (pun intended),"A little slow, but good story, gets better towards the end.Nice to see some progress with the Vala character."
5,Love stargate,"The final season of SG-1, O'neal is more of a cameo appearance but on the whole the final season is a good one. Will miss it."
5,Solid final season,"It seems that most series go out with a fizzle. Or jump the shark. Or go off into bizarre-land. SG1, having lost their star, came back strong by bringing in Browder and Black (who were coming off of Farscape). It took them a while to find their rhythm, but then they found their stride and the show started to click again, like it did in the early seasons of the series.Having watched SG1 sporadically when it was on the air, I didn't really get the Ori thing, and Claudia Black's character was simply annoying. But now, having watched the entire series through over several months, I found myself really enjoying this last season. Whether you like the Ori as bad guys, you have to admit they're more interesting than the boring Replicators. And Bacarin (from Firefly) brings in some fun, leading them in their evil endeavors. It also seemed like the cast was enjoying doing the show as well. (Season 8 was probably a low point in that regard.)"
2,"shrinkwrap Labeled as ""NEW"", fingerprints and scratches say otherwise","trying to get the rest of my stargate collection, so far the 2 sets i recived that were both labeld ""NEW"" on the shrink-wrap, and cases having their ""tamper resistant"" band on the top. show signs of wear, for this set (season 10), disk 2 of volume 1 looked like it was dropped on the floor, and scraped up with greasy fingers. so, id hardly call it new. disk 1 of volume 1 looked like it had been in a binder. and it also had fingerprints.thankfully none of the disks from season 10 set have file or corruption issues, i will keep this set, but will go back to brick and mortar stores for my media needs.the season 8 set i ordered had fingerprints on every disk, and looked like it also had been in a binder. not to mention one episode will not play (using a computer the disk shows corruption on a file VTS_01_1.VOB) so no, these sets were NOT ""New"" as they were labeled..."
1,Stargate SG-1 Season 10,I opened the case for the first time and the DVD case immediately began crumbling apart near the spine and disc 5 has trouble reading two of the episodes
4,pretty good!,"I have become totally addicted to this series! All of the seasons were excellent, and this one does not disappoint. There were a few disappointing episodes, simply because they were...well, silly ideas. Who goes off for a ""team building"" weekend while the fate of the world is hanging in the balance? In any case, buy it if you like Stargate. It would be a bit ridiculous to get it otherwise, right?"
5,Stargate SG -1 DVD,My husband is a big Stargate fan and I was glad to recieve and at a good price.Thank youCyndy
4,Goodbye Stargate,"Story lines where a bit uneven, seemed to forget the ""Ori"" even existed. Cast amazing, looking forward to Arc of Truth.Not sure about the animated series."
2,The tenth is probably my least favourite,"The tenth season of SG-1 was in my opinion the weakest of the series. I only bought this set to complete my collection. The Ori in season 9 were very well realized--and the end of season 9 cliff-hanger left me waiting anxiously for Season 10. Unfortunately, much like the last two seasons of the X-Files, SG-1's creators didn't capitalize on what was available at all. Instead the season was basically filler with the actors (well aware that this was the last season) sleep-walking through their well-worn roles. Even the attempts to mix humour into the series this season fell flat. One of the worst CGI dragons you could ever imagine served as the threat at mid-season..a sad end to a great TV series."
3,didnt watch,order them for a buddy not sure if he like them or watch both sets . will ask next time i see him
2,Stargate SG-1 Season 10------ missing episodes / incomplete season of episodes,"I am extremely disapointed in the Season 10 DVD series of episodes. The entire final episodes are not included. If I had known this in advance, I would never have purchased the Season 10 package. Someone really made a bad mistake in allowing the Season 10 to be deficient of episodes.Stargate SG-1 - Season 10Does Stargate SG-1 Season 10 disc 4 make the season 10 COMPLETE? I would appreciate a response to my REVIEW. Thanks"
2,A poor way to end a series,"I just finished watching season 10 and I was so very disappointed with the final season. The episodes seeemed to lack the creative writing that was the salvation of this series over all the years. Perhaps the last two episodes highlighted the problems with season 10 the most. The stories were not original, not well planned and thought out, and so full of holes you can drive a MALP through them. The Asgard up and die after giving SG-1 and their ship ALL their great technology. So after they installed all that technology on the ship, it can't take a couple of hits from a Prior ship? Please! We are talking about the Asgard here! The ship should have been able to perform much better than that and then they get stuck (again) in a time dialation field.It just seemed like the writers gave up trying to make the stories logical and fresh. Too bad but at least it makes me not want to see a Season 11 so I guess that is something!"
1,Directed by Darth Hideous,"What a morose way to end such a fun series. I always said that if they ever began taking this show seriously, it would come to a bad end, and I was right. It's like, we're ending the season with no sense of humor. In fact, we're gonna off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we're going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T'ealc. This show succeeded through its sense of humor (why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English? Duh!). Now it fades into oblivion without any sense of fulfillment. What a shame. Maybe that's why this season is going for $29! I'd rather buy two copies of Season 1! How do I pick zero stars?"
1,Stargate SG-1 - Season 10,I never received this title from the seller so I do not know how good it is. I have attempted to contact the seller twice by email and they have not been answered. So I will be sure not to purchase any more items from the same contact name.
1,The worst ending ever,Put simply Stargate was my favorite sci-fi series. The final season was just not good and the ending was the worst ever.
3,"With SG-1 gone ""SYFY"" has really slipped.","I won't write you a ""book"" on this one, others have already done that. This was one well done series, in just about any aspect. Well written, it even ""looked"" good- unlike the typical SYFY Saturday movie. I always wondered why religion came into the plot line the last couple of seasons, negatively portrayed at that, but maybe the writers were running out of material. Well written even if you don't like the subject matter sometimes, or the enemy ( I ""liked"" the Goa'uld- seasons 1-8, better than the Ori- 9-10, and even then the stories had something to them.Start at the beginning of the series, not the end, and always be sure to watch the extras each season.This was the best of the three Stargate series."
3,very weak ending,"Not as good as season 5, 6 or 7 but okay too.But I was very disappointed with the ending.Stargate definetely deserved a big impressive ending.For heavens sake! - such an awesome TV show - we are talking TV HISTORY:and then this weak lame ending........zero stars for the creativity of the writers involved."
3,Throw Away the Last Episode,"The Stargate series have always been some of my favorite television, and Stargate SG-1 still stands as one of the finest forms of television entertainment today, despite the fact that most of the Milky Way Galaxy and much of outlaying galaxies happen to speak English and be of Anglo-Saxon stock. But to get back to Season 10, this is the final season -- it is the one for whom the bell tolls, so to speak. And though Ben Browder is a royal pain in the patut (obnoxious is the word I was searching for) the writing redeems all but the last episode, which is lame and pointless. To use it to off the entire Asgard race and to kind of wrap up the Oris (kind of) just made it to much.In fact, what was the purpose in offing the Asgards, anyway. They were a great addition and no one really believes we're ready to be on our own yet, right?It's a good series, but the good episodes were really great and the bad ones were really awful.Hallowed be the Ori!"
5,Great Series Great Storylines.,"I have long been a fan of this Series.I have watched since first aired and I am thrilled with this season and very glad I can now purchase onDVD,I am collecting all and will do so until I have all ten seasons.Doing this makes me think that SG-1 is still out there and still,saving the Earth from other Alien attacks. After all the truth is out there.The characters & story lines would be sorely missed with out the advent of DVD's."
4,Very good choise for you as the last episode,Very good epilogue for the film. Just a few light episodes but mainly strong with heart. Recommended for you all!
