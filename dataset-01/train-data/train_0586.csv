3,Adequate,"Might i say that Borknagar is a talented group of musicians who deserve all the glory that has been given to them thus far, but after awhile, this album becomes monotone and somewhat boring. Some of the songs sound the same. All in all, this is a great metal album. I think Garm is one of the few vocalists whom you can actually ""hear"" his stage presence. he must have a lot of charisma on stage(and therefore, gets all the black-clad, goth girls; lucky duck). Garm has a voice reminiscent to Mike Patton in a way. I like the lyrics and the bass and drumming is phenomenal, but the guitars get boring after a few listens. Although Garm may not be in the group anymore(he is now in Arcturus and Ulver), he was an amazing asset to the band. If you like your heavy metal to be epic and booming, then give this album a try."
1,Made In China,"My son has this toy but I haven't given it to him to play with yet, so I can't comment on how much he likes it, however I am compelled to leave a review because looking at the tag on this toy it clearly states MADE IN CHINA. Yes Haba is a German company, and yes, some of their toys are manufactured in Germany, but some are also manufactured in China, and this product description is wrong in stating made in Germany. I have other Haba products that my son loves, and do state manufactured in Germany, but if you are looking for something not made in China, buyer beware!"
5,EXCELLENT!! A HERODOTUS LIKE HISTORY OF THE LATER ROMAN EMPIRE,"A History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene (395 A.D. to 800 A.D.): Volume 2EXCELLENT HISTORY OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE FOR WHICH LITTLE IS KNOWN OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE OF EXPERTS.IT IS WRITTEN IN THE STYLE OF THE 'FATHER OF HISTORY' HERODOTUS CONTAINING PERSONAL DETAILS OF THE LIFE OF THE MAJOR PERSONS OF EACH ERA WITH ASTUTE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIAL,ECONOMIC AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT CHARACTERIZED THAT ERA.THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE THE BOOK EDUCATIVE AND ENTERTAINING.HIGHLY RECOMENDED"
3,My Shadow,"I have fond childhood memories of this poem, so I thought my preschoolers would enjoy it. The illustrations did not capture their attention, and it was difficult to reword the text and keep the rhyme. Better for 5yrs. and older."
3,"My 3 year knows poem by heart, but illustrator's vary","I have the Rand (illustrator) version of this book. Unfortunately when I looked to obtain another copy, all the reviews are lumped together so it's hard to determine the best illustrated version.My 3 year-old absolutely loves the book. It's certainly one of our favorites. Great introduction to classic literature."
3,My Shadow,"The illustrations for the book were enchanting, but the text to the original poem was altered. This was disappointing. I wanted to use it to introduce Robert Lewis Stevenson's poetry to a group of preschool children. Young children would have related to the original wording even though the ""child"" depicted was a mouse."
1,Cheap in price and quality,"I bought this mid-tower in Nov. 2005 and now after 1 year I am having trouble with the power supply, that came with this tower, as it is making a lot of noise and there are occasions where the computer refuses to start. In addition, the quality of the hardware isn't great but to be honest considering the low price of $38.99 I paid for this product, it is not surprising that this tower lasted for only 1 year.I am now looking for a new mid-tower for my motherboard but this time I will make sure to look elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,"Having really enjoyed ""The Rotters Club"" I was very much looking forward to reading this follow up. Unfortunately I spent many days wondering whether I should continue or just give it up. It lacks the wit and sparkle of it's predecessor and is just hard going. Definitely not a page turner. Full of many factual events but without the ""umph"" I was looking for."
2,LOSING HIS CROWN,Coe's crown as king of the male confessional is slipping and the likes of Dave Armitage and Mike Gayle are ready and waiting. This is a dreadfully disappointing follow up to the excellent Rotters Club. Coe walks a fine line with what he does and sometimes he slips up. Needs to come up with something better than this or risk losing a well earned following.
3,Who is this? Eve Dallas?,"I am reviewing the audio version and I have to say, if you listen to the JD Robb ""In Death"" series, this will be confusing. This is a retread of the voices used there: Dallas, Feeney, Mavis, Cher Rio - the gang's all there. Except Roark, but I'm not finished yet, so you never know...."
1,disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book. I am a longtime Marcia Muller fan and have only missed a few in the extensive series. Unfortunately, by page 73 I was deadly bored. I just could not get into the story. It felt very dated to me even though it takes place in current times. I cannot recommend this book, but I am hoping the next installment will live up to the prior series excellence."
2,phoned it in....,"I am normally a big fan of Marcia Muller & the Sharon McCone mysteries. On this one however, it seemed like Muller phoned it in...The plot wasn't engaging & there was virtually no suspense. The plot actually seemed very contrived, conveniently tying in the culprits with *POSSIBLE SPOILER* people from Sharon's past.Basically this book just seemed a pitstop in the normally compelling Sharon McCone mystery series....."
4,"Not her best, but very good.","One of the strengths of this series is that McCone is a character who changes and grows over time. I liked that this book had her looking back to realize those changes. She's not so independent that she hasn't built relationships nor so tough that she has trouble dealing with her diabetic cat. There are good supporting characters, a tight plot and plenty of suspense. This may not be her very best book, but it's a solid installment to an excellent series."
2,Lacking more than it has,"I read close to 100 books a year, but this is my first Amazon review. I was tempted to give it a 1-star to help balance off the 5-stars he is getting from friends. Mega Warheads...candies his son sells at elementary school, coffee stands...another son in high school, off-shore islands...his advice is to buy a current book that outlines which places are good (that is what I thought I was doing when I bought a book with a sub-title How to Make and Protect Your Money, I was mistaken) There are a few tidbits of good information, but the best thing I learned is that if this author can make a living selling this advice, making money really isn't as hard as some would make it out to be. One more thing, I am not American so I am neither Republican or Democrat, but unless you think George W. Bush is a great leader and his wisdom is going to straigten out all that mess made by the Clinton years, I'd advise you to choose another book."
5,A Book That Looks at Golf's Other Side,"The author, Dr. Guy S. Fasciana, in his work Golf's Mental Magic explores the importance of not only physical but mental preparation in one's attack on the golf course. Obviously, the book is well researched but more importantly contains many concrete examples which demonstrate the author's knowledge and working background of the subject. The twelve chapters of the book touch on very important aspects necessary to play one's best golf. Not only will these topics help golfers of any level on the course but more significantly with their mental well being in life. The contributions to the book by Terry Dill, Hale Irwing, and Evelyn Aubrey are not only timely but interesting and helpful. The book is a must for one's golf library and a must read for the competitive golfer."
3,Covering my Kawasaki Mule 610,"Stays on well with elastic bands - but regret not getting tarp with grommet holes to keep it from shifting. Had this about 6 months and it does the job, but since I can't keep it taut it accumulates ice and ponds water."
2,Wasn't all that,"When I heard the single ""Act Like You Know"" I decided to give the CD a try. After listening through the CD, I thought it was kind of boring. The only songs I liked wereAct like you know - a very nice beatBrother/Sister-this one is tightCrown - beautiful melody, nice words and ""The Hills""I really did not enjoy this CD fully; I wasn't feeling most of the songs. If you like contemporary gospel I really don't recommend this CD."
3,"Some sections were a chore to read, but still worthwhile.","At times the conversation between the two friends seemed to get bogged down in semantics. Other times it read like a lecture. However the discussions still give one food for thought. While the author still has the talent for making the reader ""feel"" as if they are ""there"", the tone of the book is different from her previous work."
2,Not very interesting.,"Mary Summer Rain has written some excellent books but in my opinion Fireside is not one of them. There is very little content in the rambling essay. There is too much about her dogs and cats laying around and playing. Perhaps someone else will find more in the book than I did. I would HIGHLY recommed ""Spirit Song"", ""Phoenix Rising"" and ""Earthway"" but not ""Fireside""."
4,Tastes Good!,"What a wonderful way to organize a book! Most life stories are organized around major life events. This memoir is organized around the small events that matter in the long run. The wine is the supporting actor/ress, never overwhelming the stars, but always rounding out the story.One day, Americans will drink wine with the same sophistication we currently save for sports, complete with fan clubs and tasting events, and of course, comptitions. In the meanwhile, wine is working its way into our family events, our personal acheivements, and intimate moments. This kind of ""viral"" change takes a long time. But eventually, wine will win.These are wonderful events and worderful in the life of an interesting couple. The place wine has in their lives is probably not unique, but the writing is easy (like a summer Chard) and interesteing.Get a glass of your favorite, whatever it is, and enjoy!To your health, good times, and good friends!"
2,Much less than expected.......,"This is a narrative of the ramblings from two of the luckiest writers in America! To write for The Wall Street Journal has given them a venue much larger that earned by their writings, or their inherent wine knowledge.IF you are interestid in some rambling thoughts on the wines this odd couple has consumed in their marriage, then this is the book for you! The obscure events, such as trying a Hungarian wine in Florida and then commenting that it has ""turned brown""....any wonder? And, we are expected to find interest in this?I am at a los to really know what to think about this unexpectedly uninterresting book, except to say IF you buy it, don't say you weren't warned!K.JonesChemist and Winemaker Par-Excellance"
5,love by the glass,"I finished this wonderful book yesterday afternoon and couldn't bring myself to begin anything else...what a pleasure in the middle of such a long siege of depressing literature (the Correction) or sheer pedagogy! I've been a long time fan, and always grab for the Fri Journal;so, when I saw this on the shelves at Barnes & Noble, I grabbed it without thinking about it...what a delightful payoff! They've got such a terrific story to tell, and set a beautiful example for the rest of us who might, otherwise, fall into nightly drinking as pure habit. When is volume 2?!"
3,Not the panecia it purports to be,I have been using this book in my search for a PCP. One thing that stricks me as odd is the lack of consistency from year to year. One thing I'd expect of a top doctor is that he or she would be nominated year after year but after siting down in the library with multiple aditions not quite half the doctors are represented for multiple years. Also as another reviewer noted there is little about bed side manner. My current PCP has been in every adition of the book yet I want to switch becuase I'm not comfortable with his bedside manner. I've seen 2 physicians out of this book and I continue to look.
2,There aren't as many as you think,"New to Long Island, I was glad to find a book claiming to identify physicians with expertise. I used the book to select two successive general practitioners and found their performance below average. They were not the diagnosticians I sought, but were primarily referral agents.In addition to the current problem of managed care expecting physicians to see another patient every 15 minutes, there is an additional pressure on Long Island---the high price of real estate. A doctor living in a $750,000 house on Long Island is barely living a middle class existence compared to Wall Street brokers. There is thus twice the pressure to have a rapid turnover of patients.People searching for doctors should continue to look for diplomas from the best medical schools...and then ask whether the doctor's mortgage is completely paid off."
5,Great...,This CD is just what I was looking for. As a child my parents use to play this for me. Now I can play it for my son. I was glad I was able to find it on Amazon and not have to have it shipped from Mexico. :)
5,Cri Cri took me back to my childhood memories,"I wanted to share something that was sweet with my newborn daughter. And then I remember my dad playing Cri Cri for me when it was on a record. I was so excited when I found it on CD, since I no longer have a record player. We both enjoy listening to the CD I dance for her and she smiles and now that she is almost 4 months old she gets excited when I put the CD on."
5,Hard to Find 45's on CD,This CD was worth the purchase and I plan on purchasing others in the future.
5,Oldies,The CD was everything I wanted and more you hear the song's a fraction of the time on the radio
2,Not enough to warrant the purchase.,"As another noted, too much VERY obscure (regardless of Billboard ranking). I am a huge fan of '50's and 60's music, so this collection is aimed for folks like me. Unfortunately, there is too much here that is rather obscure, and much other which is locatable elsewhere (but, they do call this ""Hard to Find"", after all).If, like me you are a fan of Peggy Marsh's ""I Will Follow Him"" (or for that matter, fondly recall the Singing Nun), you will buy this, cause it cannot be found elsewhere. I guess the marketers put a few songs like that on each disc of this collection, and hope we'll buy a bunch of discs for one or two songs. You can fill in the name of any one of about a third of the songs on this disc and come up with the same result.Sometimes they are right. But there is way too much filler here. I call myself a fan of the genre, but only heard of 60% of the songs or artists. Not the kind of value any but the most fanatical of us want."
5,Bobby's Girl In Incredible True Stereo,"This is where you will find the incredible true stereo version of Bobby's Girl. The back of the CD states:""All tracks digitally transferred from the original analog master tapes""You will never hear Bobby's Girl sound better than this."
4,Protect the Boss,"This was truly a woman's movie. Funny and engaging! It was refreshing to see an Asian woman without any of the cultural inhibitions and a ""I will survive"" attitude. The issue of Asian women in the workplace and the chauvanistic male attitude wasrealistically applied thoughout this movie. The heroine is a strong and optimistic character, full of life and with lots of spunk."
2,The Boss Needs Protection,"""Protect the boss"" is the 200th remake of ""a poor good girl meets a super-rich unruly immature guy + love triangle + disapproving parents + rich people fight over money"" drama. There is absolutely no twist or surprise element in the story. In the first few episodes where feisty Che Gang-Hi and immature Ji Son butt heads there are some actions, but soon after it becomes just another melodrama that tries to be clever with criticism of Korean super-riches. Actually there is a scene where Ji Son tells Che Gang-Hi ""you used to be so attractive because you were so feisty, but now you are boring. I want the old feisty you back"" and that is exactly how it feels. Toward the end the only funny scenes are by Wang Ji-Hye. She plays a rich girl who is an enemy of Che Gang-Hi early, but she turns into a lovable ditz.It is for the fans of the actors or soap operas, and if you are looking for a new story with a lot of twists and multiple layers, this is not it."
3,Not recommened,"I've been using this converter for a few months. It works well and does what is supposed to do. It also has two serial ports. But it's expensive, big and not plug-n-play even under Windows XP (requires some drivers and configuration). It would be ok for desktops, but clearly not a good match for notebooks. So why would you buy this one if there are cheaper, smaller and easier to use alternatives?"
4,Flamingoes,"I ordered the wrong item and thought I was actually going to get a set of two flamingos to use as a gag gift. I was shocked when a book about flamingos arrived, but the book is in almost new condition so I guess I'll just give the book as a gag gift."
2,Hard to believe,"Although the premise was interesting, it just didn't make sense. I found the book hard to get through although the sex scense were erotic."
5,"Incredible Sex - Warm, appealing characters -- 10 stars!","The best in the menage genre that I've read. No convoluted ""justifications"", just a simple story of one night---one extraordinary night---of hot, intense sex, and three characters that you quickly come to care for because their caring and love for each other is so obvious.I honestly can't wait to read Jonah's story. Please, Ms. Byrd, drop everything else and give us Jonah! All three characters were warm and appealing, but Jonah had a sweet vulnerability, even though he was such a sexy, seductive devil.Can't recommend this book highly enough."
4,Hot! Hot! Hot!,"Boy does Mrs. Byrd like to push all the buttons. Gabe is in love with Denny but because of a past problem does not think he is good enough. But Denny is in love with Gabe and will do anything to win his love. And sexy Jonah is just the man to help it all happen. These three turn up the sheets in this book. Mostly the whole story ends up in Gabe's aprtment with wild hot sex, but hey I'am not complaining. This is one wild ride and I can't wait for Jonah's story to come out. Another great one by Mrs. Byrd"
2,"Way below par, even for Ellora's Cave","Gabriel is attracted to secretary Denny, but won't act on it. His best friend Jonah knows that the two are hot for each other and show up on his doorstep with Denny in tow and offers to be the third in a threesome to bring them together so they can realize their passion for each other. Basically one single night of so-called passion (with oddly placed flashbacks in the middle of torrid sex scenes), then the two profess their love for each other several orgasms later. Denny has no self confidence - we are told this over and over and over and... it just got old. No real romance, unintentionally funny dialog, and after awhile, the sex just gets tedious and boring.I have found that Ellora's Cave novels are a hit or a miss for me. This one falls way short of expectations, and at over $11 (or over $100 on the Ammy Marketplace), a huge waste of money. If it's threesomes you're looking for, stick to the Men of August series by Lora Leigh."
3,Not that comfy,I bought the right size but it's not really comfy and it tends to slip off my foot. It doesn't give a flattering look to my feet.
5,Honda Vtc 700 Manual,Excellent resource for the older Honda Shadow bike. Thanks for having it available to us! Helpful for the new owner (and possibly the longer term owner of this wonderful motorcycle. Recommend purchase.
3,Bad design for heavy clay soils,"My review is based on heavy clay soil so if you have light soil it may be okay. The holes for the water are at the tip of the prongs so when you push, and sometimes push hard because of the soil, it clogs the tip with dirt, small rocks, and you have stop to clean the holes. Tried different techniques, pushing slow, moving back & forth but still would clog. It is very well made, 5 stars, so disappointed as many other irrigators have plastic in stress areas which require care and shorten the life but it doesn't work for heavy soils."
3,Open to Improvisation,"While Michael Jones' music, as heard on his recordings, can be quite beautiful, I have found the piano book a bit disappointing because it doesn't sound as rich and full. Michael seems to improvise a lot as he plays, and these improvisations are not written down for you, so the music appears quite simple at times. Given that caveat, the music is still enjoyable to play, and there is a sense of accomplishment in mastering the songs with trickier rhythms."
2,A bit old and stinky,"I've used this product before, but that was when I bought it from an outdoor retail store. They worked great then. The 12 pack I bought from Amazon, however, may have been old or something. The warmers smell really strange, kind of like fish, and they don't seem to get as warm as the ones I used before. My guess is that they expire after a while, and that these are just too old. Considering the price, though, I guess they aren't so bad."
4,Love these!,"Don't go another winter without these! I have been buying them for a couple of years, and I don't know how I got through the winter before. My feet tend to get very cold, and these things are wonderful!! Perfect for outdoor activities in the cold weather. A+++"
2,Discolored the bottom of my Shoes!,"I don't know what was wrong with these, which I bought in 2009. They got warm, but after a few uses, I noticed the bottom of my shoes had marks like scorch marks on the innersoles of my shoes and boots.And some of the scorch color came off on my socks. I can't get the entire ""scorch"" marks off the insoles. Maybe the foot warmers were old and on their ""last legs"", so to speak."
3,Not lasting as long as expected,"I've used other warmers by Heat Treat. I swear by their toe warmers. I gave these a try this fall, but they do not seem to last over about 3 hours. I've used 3 pair so far and they all performed about the same. Maybe I have an old batch or something. The box of toe warmers I have is a few years old now and still last over 5 hours."
5,We Need All their albums in US,"Great band, Great Music wish they would sell all their albums here in the US"
5,Great,The book was in great condition. Better than described when I bought it!! It arrived very quickly!!
2,Get Magee instead,"This was required for my ortho PT class, but its not very user friendly. There are several contradictions and mistakes and the pictures are not arranged the best. I wish I would have bought Magee's Ortho text instead."
5,"Dutton - Orthopaedic Assessment, Evaluation & Intervention",This book is a brilliant reference for Physiotherapists or anyone in a related field. It is very comprehensive. My only criticism is that it is only two-colour print.
3,Ortho Book review,"This book is hard to read and although is a good resource to have, I like the Magee and other supplemental versions better. I am in grad school and like the material to be more organized and repetitive, so for the money I would buy something else and use the library for this particular book."
2,1957 Chevy assembly manual,"I was not aware that what I was buying was not the Assembly manual, but a stack of loose copies of pages from the manual. The pages are punched for a three ring binder which is not included. They don't appear to be in any particular order, nor are they numbered, and there is no sort of index. When I have time, I suppose I will be able to go through them and put them in some sort of order. Maybe I should buy a copy of the 1957 Chevrolet assembly manual to find what order the pages are supposed to be in. Very Disappointing!!!!!"
2,faulty toaster oven,"the toaster ovens {2} both had faulty handles. In fact, they were broken.we feel that Krups needs to redesign this unit so that the handle does not fall off."
4,ONE HECK OF A COLLECTION (AND SERIES),"If you're not familiar with the YELLOW PILLS series, then this is the best place to start. Jordan Oakes has a knack for compiling the perfect power pop mix CD, with most of the artists new to the average listener. This collection is from 1997, but the sound is always fresh. You know you're going to hear great melodies, soaring harmonies, jangly/crunchy guitars, boy/girl lyrics, cymbals, tambourines and handclaps to the max! Only I myself can create a better mix CD from my own personal collection."
5,Best Kitchen Distraction Ever!,"I am a tough customer, and this toy has gotten sooooo much play, it's incredible. Hours of fun and a good distraction for my son while I'm cooking! The tracks are SUPER sturdy, but we did have to buy more marbles to replace the one's he lost under the stove. Worth every single penny...get the Deluxe set!!!"
5,Fun for everyone,"This was a present for my 4-year-old's birthday, and everyone who visits us wants to play! I've even found myself playing with it when no one else is around. The kids can experiment with different arrangements, and their engagement with the toy keeps them interested in the explanations of how it works."
4,Great toy but just one thing...,"This is a wonderful toy and there are so many creative ways to position it. My 6 year old son couldn't stop playing with it the minute it was up and after about a half an hour he was trying to create his own designs. The only thing - we've had it two weeks we've got 3 marbles left. Not sure there is a real fix for that, except to put a barrier in front of the bottom of the refrigerator and stove (as they do roll). I would not let that stop you from buying the product. But you might have to buy an extra bag of marbles to got with it."
5,Easy fun for the family - watch those marbles!,"This is the second set of these fridge-based marble run toys I've bought and both times it's been a huge hit at the holiday get-togethers. Basically, everyone starts putting up and re-arranging pieces on the side of the fridge and tries to see if the marbles will go through to the end without flying off the end of a ramp or bounce off somewhere. It's a lot of fun, takes a bit of teamwork and figuring out and is something just about anyone can do.I will say, watch out for the marbles. When they go off the track, they can roll anywhere! Other than that little issue, this is a fun puzzle and interesting way for folks to hang around the kitchen while dinner is cooking or cookies are being baked. Everyone has fun from the grown-ups to the kids to even the dog...but don't let him get that marble!"
3,"Great idea, but...","I found this item on a list of toys for kids with Autism. My son has Autism & I thought he might like this and purchased it for Christmas. I was disappointed in the performance of some of the pieces. There are two buckets and I'm guessing, because of their shape, that one bucket is supposed to tip one way & the other bucket tips the other way. One of our buckets consistently tips the way it's designed to, while the other bucket tips whichever way it feels like at that moment and randomly spills marbles onto the floor. The piece that looks like a ferris wheel or water mill wheel did not work at all; no matter how I positioned it, the marbles just bounced off of it onto the floor. My son was disappointed in this because he loves to watch things spin.Overall, it's a great idea if you can get it to work like it's supposed to. Maybe I got a faulty set or something. Anyhow, I was disappointed & so was my son."
3,grandmother,Interesting toy my grandson wanted for Christmas. Had trouble finding a metal place to put it. All our appliances are stainless steel.
3,"Beware, cheaper in local hardware/grocery supermarkets","Feel and handle just like other ordinary chisel's. It is good enough for occasional home use, doesn't feel sturdy.Just days after I bought it I found 20% cheaper price locally, so I guess I am stuck with one I bought here, but will teach me not to trust Amazon prices."
5,chisels,a three piece wood chisel set that is another Stanley set covered by the lifetime warranty and is easy to handle and use
3,"Sharpen easily, dull easily.","I quite frankly bought these chisels for the price. Good for occasional use, I think. They hone to a nice edge, but dull quickly. I would have preferred harder steel to hold an edge longer, but it's a choice. I have a 50+ year old Craftsman chisel my Dad bought for a buck at Sears.. that was used as a pry bar, to scrape the slag from welding, and even cut the heads off nails.. that I recently honed and restored that will cut circles around these. That's Old School quality. Nowadays, it's either too hard to hone or too soft to hold an edge.. these are the ""soft"" ones."
5,Michael Sweet's best work to date.,"I've been a Stryper/Michael Sweet fan since 1985 when I first bought ""Soldiers Under Command."" I was initially disappointed when Michael left the band in 1992 to pursue a solo career, but then became intrigued with the prospect of what his solo material might be like and how it might compare with his work with Stryper. I thought his self-titled 1994 debut was OKAY, but I was much more impressed with his largely acoustic follow-up ""Real"" (1995). But ""Truth"" blows away both of its predecessors. Musically, this is Michael's most diverse release to date, and the lyrics show much growth and maturity. Some standout tracks include ""I Am Adam,"" ""Save Me,"" ""The Ever After,"" ""Achilles Heel,"" ""Stone"" and the title track. Fellow Stryper guitarist Oz Fox plays a guest solo on ""The Ever After."" ""Truth"" is Michael Sweet's best release to date, and I look forward to hearing more music from Michael, both with Stryper and as a solo artist."
1,False Advertised,No where on this page does it say that you are getting 2 256M memory sticks. Thats what you are getting. NOT 1 stick of 512. Shouldn't that be stated? Even the picture shows only one chip!
4,Great but not the best transfers,"Star Wars + Family Guy is a great match and I thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy. This blu-ray transfer is great but if you already have the DVD set, I wouldn't bother with upgrading. Really only ""It's A Trap"" (the third in the series) looks good in HD. The other two movies are average, look like they could've come from the DVD. ""Blue Harvest"" seems like a quick upconvert to 1080P"
3,Not Bad For the Price...,"I should have known something was up when this box set was so cheap... Ony ""It's a Trap is in HD. The other two are in 4/3 aspect ratio standard definition. I understand the extra cost in rescanning the originals but I would have been willing to pay a little extra for HD on all the movies."
4,"Good, but not great","Definitely had some good laughs, however wasn't a 'side splitter' if you will. I had seen the shows before, so I knew what I was getting. A complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) was the video quality of the first movie, Blue Harvest, was essentially that of an up-converted DVD. Putting in the other two movies will make you realize the vast improvement in the quality compared to the first. The extras were for the most part entertaining and interesting. The commentary was very similar to the commentary on the DVDs of the show except with more information on production, ideas about S.W., etc. I've very satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price of $23 for the set. I just wished 1/3 of the video quality lived up to the other 2/3!"
3,the comedy goes downhill as you get further in the movies.,"The first Movie Blue Harvest was great.Something Darkside was having some troubles, adding more references to the series it's self like the cleaning lady, a friend had to explain that joke to me. Some of the jokes seemed to be stretched too long, like the tripping of the walker.It's a trap was just horrid. they did that ready joke 2 times and with the past episodes of the chicken VS Peter in the series being funny fights they missed a great opportunity to make that real funny. It is like they said in the crawl, they just ran out of steam."
3,Blu-Ray Wasn't Necessary,"I love Family Guy and, overall, I'm pretty psyched that I ended up buying this. However, I wish I would've gone with the DVD version since Blue Harvest and Something, Something, Something, Darkside weren't originally aired in HD and weren't re-mastered in any way for their blu-ray release. I would've liked to see the animators take that additional step since they decided to release on both formats. Without the remastered visuals, it seems like kind of a money grab to me."
4,Very entertaining parodies,"Purchased the blu-ray version because they are region free. Very good value for money and excellent entertainment value for all the grown-ups in the family. Be warned though that there parts with audult-content. Overall, these are very entertaining parodies of the original sw trilogy."
1,Discs do not play in my Sony BluRay player,"I have already seen these flicks and liked them so much I had to buy them.I updated my firmware for my Sony BDP-S550 blu-ray player. Disc 1, Blue Harvest, does NOT play. Disc 2, something something, something Dark Side plays, but takes over 5 minutes to load. Disc 3, It's a trap, does NOT play.I want to exchange them, but since Amazon is out of stock, I'm going to wait until they are back in stock.In the meantime, I'm going to continue to track firmware updates for my player."
1,Two Something Something Dark Side NO! ITS A TRAP?!?!?,"I got mine from amazon itself and it came in a few days which i was very excited for. Opened it up was about to watch all of them and noticed it had TWO SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE IN IT AND NO ITS A TRAP. very very very very disappointed. First time i ever even wrote a review, thats how disappointed."
1,1/3 Of The Set Is Good,'Blue Harvest' is the only one of the trilogy worth watching more than once. 'It's A Trap' will never see the inside of my player again. Family Guy has been such a disappointment over this past season... this trilogy clearly shows the efforts of a dying brand.
2,Quick Buck,"This is going to be a quick review i have other things to do, but after buying this i felt compelled to warn people. The first 2 movies, Blue Harvest and Something ''' Darkside, have not been touched up at all. They are exactly as you saw them on TV. Even the aspect ratio is 1.33 which for those who don't know 4.3 box old tv/ monitor. I haven't watched the new movie Its a trap but it says it is displayed in widescreen and can assume a 1080p res. Basically they made their newest movie and took the 2 old ones and threw them on a blu ray. They are DVD quality and dont even compare to films such as steam boy, spirited away and other OLDER cartoons on dvd.Still watch them because its entertaining but boo for ripping everyone off!"
2,wasteful,The best of this series of parodies was Blue Harvest--it sort of goes down hill from there. Did they really need a three disc set? Really? This wouldn't have fit on one disc? What a bunch of horse crap.
2,Warning!!! 2 Disks are Full Screen!,Got this Blu-ray box set. Watched all 3. Thought I could get rid of my DVD copys but NO. Both Blue Harvest and Something Darkside are in full screen so pic is chopped :( Its a trap was however widescreen. Becareful. Good price but very distracting to watch.
5,super song on this cd,"i just entered the world of dominican music, having recently returned from my first trip to the island. the whole genre is very, very good, and i was amazed at the quality of the music even on the radio.my interests include 50's-60's jazz, some of the older brazilian jazz, jamaican reggae, some rock, etc.anthony santos is very, very good, perhaps the best. he plays the two popular types of music, bachatas and merengues. merengues is a faster beat. i guess he's known for his bachata, but i think he is the best merengue player. i like merengue led by the guitar.i think the first track ""el baile el perrito"", is a super song. it would be hard for a song from any genre of music to top it. the whole cd is very good, i'm sure, but a song like this is a pinnacle of the genre, in my opinion. it's hard to imagine music being better than this merengue song."
3,Holding Back the Sea,"Mr. Hallowell did an exceptional job of capturing the complex causes, contributing factors, and environmental effects of wetland decline and loss in south Louisiana. There is no escaping the fact that this is an environmental disaster of a massive scale, one that is little appreciated outside of the region. When Mr. Hallowell describes people and cultures, though, he falls a bit short. His characterization of citizens living in south Louisiana seems to have been formed in part by bad movies and other forms of popular culture. Additionally, he didn't get an accurate feel for the diverse people working in wetland restoration in the state, often ascribing attitudes and viewpoints to individuals that are skewed and sometimes just plain wrong. I do recommend this book, however. Read it and learn from the science oriented parts. Learn about the culture and people from another source."
5,For buyers waiting! Still available!,I do not have anything to add to the positive reviews. The entire series is indeed a goldmine!Go to google.com and/or gemm.com. OR to ericrecords and there you will find it possible to buy this one!Enjoy!
5,"""IT'S TUTTO TUCCI!!!""","IT'S ALL TUCCI! HE PLAYS A CHARACTER THATS ACROSS BETWEEN,ROBERTO BENIGNI&PETER; SELLERS.STANLEY TUCCI IS A COMIC GENIUS! I FOUND THIS MOVIE BY ACCIDENT. I WANTED TO KNOW WHATANNA MARIA ALBERGHETTI WAS UP TO THESE DAY'S. BESIDES MS. ALBERGHETTI ,TWO MORE OF MYFAVORITE ACTRESS'S ARE,TALIA SHIRE AND BRIDGET FONDA. ALSO AWARD WINNING ACTORGIAN CARLO GIANINNI.THIS DVD GO'S IN MY COLLECTION WITH,""MOONSTUCK"",""RETURN TO ME"" AND THE""QUIET MAN"",""MARTY"".;COMEDY,TRAGEDY,LOVE AND A HAPPY ENDING!

AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW HE DIEDIN 1993...YOU WOULD BELIEVE THEM. THIS FILM WAS DIRECTED BY,GEORGE ZALOOM."
1,Disappointed,"I am a fan of Stanley Tucci, but the movie's acting, plot, and script are very lacking. A waste of excellent talent."
2,beware greedy dealers!!!,"As I write this, the cheapest used copy of this CD is selling for $89, or you can buy a ""new"" copy for $495. Yes, you read that right. Is anyone else outraged by those prices? I love power pop music and the ""Yellow Pills"" series is uniformly excellent. I would give this album 4-5 stars on music merits alone, but I'm giving a lower rating just for the unabashed greed of the dealers currently selling this CD for such outrageous prices. There oughta be a law ... or at least an Amazon policy to prevent such over-the-top price gouging. I know; ""what the market will bear"" and all that free enterprise yadayada, but prices this high are simply obscene!"
1,Magellan AC adapter 980663,It did not work with my Magellan Roadmate 2200T. The add did not specify that it only works for older models. I had to buy a new adapter.
1,Customer service disappears,Adapter advertised to work with Magellan 2200t but is the wrong adapter. Not sure who is at fault but Amazon has not responded.
1,AC ADAPTER,"This adapter was recommended on the Amazon website as a companion purchase with the Magellan RoadMate 2200T. This recommendation must be in error. First, the RoadMate 2200T comes with an AC Adapter. Second, this adapter is for another RoadMate and does not work with the RoadMate 2200T."
1,plunge base is poorly constructed,"I purchased this router to replace a 15 year old Black and Decker Quantum plunge base router. I thought I was purchasing a high quality router that would serve me well for another 15 years. But I find this product unusable as a plunge router. The plunge movement grabs and sticks so much that depth adjustments are impossible to predict. The worst issue is the excessive play between the router bit and the base - 0.024"". Try routing with a 0.125"" router bit with 0.024"" side play."
5,Porter-Cable 893PK,"The router has enough power for use in a table. With the variable speed feature, you don't have to worry too much about burning. The one and only thing I don't like is the squarish depth stop knob on the plunge base because it is so uncomfortable to use. Replace it with another one of your choosing. The height adjuster is superbly designed. Lastly, this kit costs only 50$ more than the 1 3/4 hp variable speed plunge kit."
2,Too much filler,I am a first time reader of Ludlum and after all the rave revues I am a little disappointed in this book. Although the plot could have been good idea it is hard to follow and jumps back and forth. Maybe some of his other books might be better.
5,A very entertaining book,"Full of suspense and blood, it's a must read for every action thriller book lover."
4,Riveting story lines and characters,"Robert Ludlum has an unsurpassable talent of knitting a large scale intrigue and have his characters unravel the mysteries of the plot one logical step at a time. Both Scofield and Taleniekov will have to wait until the next page to know more than we do. No short cuts, no long detours, just straight forward, nail bitting, edge of your seet action. My only regret is that this book resembles every other Ludlum Book. But hey that's why we love him"
4,wonderfully executed story line,Ludlum once again captures his audience by throwing several twists and turns in the story line. It is a fast paced story that will keep you in suspense for the entire book.
5,Required reading,"If you're fan of spy thrillers, then this is required reading. Sure, it's Cold War stuff that's a bit dated, but I promise you it's still quite a ride even today.Even moreso when I read it back in the 1980s, when the Soviets and the bad old KGB were primal American fears. Ludlum brilliantly twists that notion 180-degrees: the thought that a CIA agent and KGB agent would get togther was stunning indeed.When I read this book, it knocked me on my butt. I couldn't put it down and I couldn't forget it. Now, a decade-and-half later, I find myself doing my own writing and this book still influences me.So yeah - buy it. And don't expect to get any sleep. But a word of warning - do not read this and then expect the sequel, MATARESE COUNTDOWN, to match its power. It doesn't. That one is hack Ludlum of recent times, he's lost his gift.But not back in 1980 - he was a master. Enjoy."
4,Woodside Review,"This was another great fast-paced book by Robert Ludlum. I was on the edge of my chair throughout the whole novel. It makes you guess whether things that happen in this book could really happen. I would recomend this book for anyone who is a fan of Ludlum, or anyone who likes spy and fast paced novels."
4,"Good read, but sloppy details.","Although sloppy in the research department, the character development and plot make this a very enjoyable book to breeze through. I enjoyed every minute it took to finish."
1,Surprisingly poor,"I was really disappointed with this, my first Ludlum novel.The plot wasn't bad but the book is really badly written.Avoid if you have more than a rudimentary grasp of English grammar."
3,Good story - too clean ending,"I enjoy Ludlum's books; however, I was a bit dissapointed how ""clean"" the book ended. Without giving away the whole store, I won't go into details except to say that everything wrapped up together a little too neat. Still, I will continue reading Ludlum's books b/c they are exciting good reads."
3,"Good, typical Ludlum","THIS BOOK STARTED OFF SLOWLY AND THEN PICKED UP. I LIKED IT AND IT KEPT MY ATTENTION. AS WITH MOST OF HIS BOOKS, A LITTLE FAR FETCHED AND TOO MUCH CREDIT GIVEN TO THE BAD GUYS. BUT, OVERALL A VERY ENJOYABLE READ."
4,Could it be real?,"This book is really heavy to read, it has to many characters and to many places, the advantage is that many of them are killed in the same chapter so you don't have to follow everybody's story, but is a good one, it keeps you reading, the only thing that I don't know is if it could be real that a spy form USSR and a spy from USA could work together, is a heavy and a nice reading."
4,"Nice, action packed, well tought intrigue",Very good book. One of the best in this category. In my opinion the best Ludlum novel. Does not get old...
5,The best work of a great author...,"This was the first book of Ludlum's that i had read, and i was mesmerized...i could not put it down! The delicate weaving of characters, action past and present, and ever-present danger makes this book a winner. I know that Robert Ludlum wrote many books before the ""The Bourne Identity"", but in my mind, this was the best of them all. If you liked ""The Bourne Identity"", then you have to read this book...i believe you will like it better!"
5,Really Good Book!!,I purchased this book for a a gift. The person who received it liked it very much.It arrived in very good condition. The person who received it was happy to get it.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Two ageing spies are coming to the end of the careers. On differentsides of the cold war, both men are in similar position, veteran fieldagents that are not necessarily so useful anymore, but know a lot ofsecrets. They have no families to live for.They can't stand each other, but they uncover a conspiracy thatshocks even them, and must form an uneasy alliance to try and stop thismassive corporate funded terrorist plot."
3,"GOOD, TYPICAL LUDLUM -","THIS BOOK STARTED OFF SLOWLY AND THEN PICKED UP. I LIKED IT AND IT KEPT MY ATTENTION. AS WITH MOST OF HIS BOOKS, A LITTLE FAR FETCHED AND TOO MUCH CREDIT GIVEN TO THE BAD GUYS. BUT, OVERALL A VERY ENJOYABLE READ."
3,"Fun read, but pretty fluffy","This book is good. It is a fun adventure story that will carry you along from scene to scene. It would be marked 5 stars if fluffy spy espionage were on the top of my list.. which it isn't. It isn't great writing, the same artifices are used many times, and the book contradicts itself occassionally. However, it is a great adventure romp if you like fluffy adventures."
3,The research should be better,"I wish the great writer like R. Ludlum would do a better research. This book was a disappointment, although I generally LOVE his books. And the reason for the disappointment were scenes and people from Russia. They made me laugh. The words he uses usually either don't exist or mean something completely different. The names!!! He gave a male character a woman's name! Believe me I know, I was born there. Makes you think: is everything he writes about other countries as believable as this? Too bad."
2,"illogical, poorly plotted, and silly","Ludlum's popularity mystifies me. Are people just impressed by anyone who can write a long book about an international conspiracy, regardless of how thin the characterizations or implausible the plot? The plot of this book was probably composed in its entirety in about 15 minutes of ""thought"" while Ludlum was watching a TV sitcom. Compare this self-indulgent book, with its reliance on laughably unlikely coincidences, with the wonderfully plotted books by Robert Goddard or the massively researched Tom Clancy novels. Doesn't it embarrass Ludlum to be competing with those writers?"
1,HORRIBLE,"I can not believe that I was fooled twice by Wilton! First I bought the battery operated one and that just drained my NEW batteries within minutes - then I bought this one and what a piece of garbage, I was able to get 4 cookies before I realized that the inside metal rod pushed right past the plastic ""dough pusher"" I tried for a half hour to fix it and couldn't. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - THIS IS HORRIBLE!"
1,Theoretically sound. Theoretically.,"What a disagreeable excuse for a product! Wilton has lost any respect I may have had for them as a company of bakeware. I, too, received this press as a gift years ago and used it three to four times, all the while encountering resistance from the barrel while trying to move the dough through the mechanism. Looks great in a photograph but is poor in actuality. The plastic casing screwed to the metal frame cracked part way. Once it splits ocmpletely, the entire set is useless. Will not buy from this company in future."
1,Waste of dough - pun intended,"Doesn't work. Hurts my hand because you have to press on the top as well. Dough does not come out as stated, you have to press several times. The ratcheting mechanism slips. I had bought this one to replace the plastic one that broke, thinking I was upgrading. Nope."
1,Very disappointed ! Major design flaw!,"I purchased this expensive cookie press thinking I was going to avoid the poor quality of other plastic models. Yes, it is made of metal, however, little did I know, the main mechanism for pumping the dough at the top of the cylinder is made of plastic - which cracked the second time I tried to use it. I expect that from a cheap $10 model, but that's completely unacceptable for such an expensive model. Next time I will make sure the press is COMPLETELY metal!"
1,It ruined cookie day!,"For the past 2 years, I have heard my sister grumble over the spritz cookies. This year I took over the cookie and after 45 minutes threw in the towel and this cookie press into the trash. It is not only a cheaply made product but a bad design and even when it works, the cookies are smaller than quarters. Every year my mother, sister and I get together to make cookie during an all day bake-a-thon. I'm a grown woman with children of my own, and was temted to roll on the floor kicking and screaming like a mad child told no more cookies after my time spent with the cookie press. My sister just said I told you so.. Don't waste your money buying it."
2,Appears to be solidly constructed. Looks are deceiving.,"I make hundreds and hundreds of spritz cookies every Christmas. Each year, I am always looking for a new press because the previous one has failed...and always in the middle of baking. I did manage to find a plastic one a few years ago - made in Europe and equipped with two dough tubes that makes a good backup. I will often bring that press out to complete the spritz cookies... but it cannot be used on a constant basis. Dont know why. This Wilton model is stainless steel and seems to be well constructed. The press mechanism begins to slip causing the dough to back up. A real nuisance! You have to use a cool cookie sheet in order for the dough to adhere to once it's pressed.Cleaning it is time consuming. The whole thing must be taken apart. The nice thing about this model is that the die plates store in it own cap which screw onto the press for storage.Not using it this year. Going to try a more expensive European model this season."
1,Enjoy returning useless products? This is for you...,"My old cookie press was my mother's and it was the old aluminum tube with a handle you had to turn manually to press out the dough. Remembering how she fussed and fumed with that, I thought buying a cookie press with the Wilton name would be a sure thing. Wrong! After I got one sheet of cookies out, the crank thingy quit pressing the dough down. I asked my husband to take a look at it since he's the fixer-of-all-things and even he couldn't get the thing to work. I returned it. Don't waste the time, money or effort."
2,Doesn't last,"I make hundreds of cookie batches every Christmas. Needless to say, my cookie presses never last. I love Wilton bakeware so I thought I would try their stainless steel version. After 1 Christmas season, the ratchets wore down and it wouldn't work. The metal teeth just wouldn't catch and I had to throw it away. I'm trying the Williams Sonoma version - at least I can return it in a year if it, too, breaks.Just to note, though, it was great while it did work!"
1,Hard to Make Cookies,"It's hard to press it down to release the dough from the ""gun"". I had to keep peeling off the dough from the bottom and refilling the cookie press. I remember last time after I finally got the cookies done, my arms were sore the next day. Today we used this cookie press and found out it has stopped working. It's pricy but very short life. We only used it for about 5 times. I definitely will not buying this product again."
2,Reach Flossers,Item arrived ahead of schedule. All is well at our household now and hopefully I will continue to use these items on a daily basis.
5,Thank God someone invented these!,"Wrestling with floss is a nightmare, especially with numb, painful hands (and long nails!). These are wonderful. My package was short one head, but that happened at the factory, not with the seller. No biggie. I'm still thrilled with these."
5,great product but beware seller,"great flossing product in the mint flavor. beware of this seller, complete rip off on shipping by AmericanWholesale - Amazon Marketplace. so if you think you are getting a good price, carefully examine the shipping cost, purchased 12 of these and they charged me $21.00 for dropping them into a 75c envelope and mailing it. so i could have just pulled them off the rack at walgreens. i love these flossers, have been using them for about 5 years, i think they may have been discontinued so i shall stock pile them and the handles."
3,Slow getting started. Rebellious Child,"NEGATIVES: This book was really slow and boring at the beginning. The girl wrote at length about her dog, something I doubt anyone would really do. The teen-age girl also had entirely too much freedom. I was a teen-ager during this period of time and didn't have half the freedom this child had. She defied her parents and they acquieced to her demands, something that was not common at the time.POSITIVES: This was a very distressing and turbulent time in America, and the conflicting emotions are well-portrayed. There are a lot of historical facts and references.I will place this in the children's library, but with an age reservation and a warning to parents."
4,The Vietnam War through the eyes of the sister of a soldier,"The Vietnam War comes down tough on fifteen year old Molly Mackenzie Flaherty. All the pain and death the war is causing is too much for her to handle-especially since her own brother, Patrick, has gone to fight himself. She misses him more every day-especially when she is informed that he is injured. Molly's world is falling apart-no one is happy, nothing is good.She decides to get a job at a near by army hospital-where her eyes are opened to the facts of life, and what war is really all about.Everything is tangled up in her emotions. What can she do? Will she ever find happiness?A good book about what it's like to be the sister of a soldier."
2,Could have been better,I give this book a 2 because a lot of it wa sboring and hard to understand. I wouldn't recommend this book to children who are younger than 11 because it has bad words in it and you don't want them going around the house saying bad words. This book could have been bettter.
4,"Good Book, But too political","While the Dear America books are supposed to represent girls in important events of our past, this particular diary takes a certain turn and takes place about 30 years ago, in one of the most devastating times in history-the Vietnam War. ... I think that this book was really great, but, it starts to die down about halfway through, which made me kinda disappointed and angry that I spent ($$$) on it. I personally think her other two books in the Dear America series were much better. But, if you are a true Dear America fan, like myself, you should buy this to complete your collection and it wouldn't hurt to give this book a try!"
4,Amazing Book!,"I touching and telling account of living in America during the Vietnam War. The author is a wonderful writer. I love her stories of the Vietnam era. Her chatacters dilemnas and attitudes ring completely true and honest. If you like this book you have to read the companion My Name is America: The Diary of Sean Patrick Flaherty -- which I loved even more then this one. Also, the author has some other Vietnam era books for teens that are out of print but worth looking for, including: The Road Homeand the Echo company series written under the name Zack Emerson."
4,Great Book!,Loved it! Couldn't put it down. Great story about live at home during Vietnam and the pain of the veterans. Can't wait to read the brother novel in The My name is Ameria series. The Journal of Patrick Seamus Flaherty. I expect that will almost be a better novel then this one!
4,"good product, good value","Nice punch, works well. Quality made item, good value when compared toother brands. Not the best but pretty good."
5,great strings,"I started using these recently. They sound great throughout their life, which is long. They feel great too, which to me is just as important. I have been buying these as replacement sets for each of my basses."
5,"Best info. to help you ""right the wrong"" of W/C claims",This book has so much vitually important information for the employee going through a worker's comp situation. It covers all from the begining to the end. THIS BOOK WILL GIVE YOU THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO FIGHT FOR YOUR LAWFUL RIGHTS -- DO NOT GIVE IN OR GIVE UP -- WITH THIS BOOK YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND REALIZE THAT THE FIGHTERS ARE THE ONES THAT RECEIVE WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY/LAWFULLY INTITLED TO THEN.KEEP FIGHTING AND BELIEVING THAT 'JUSTIFICATION FOR EMPLOYEER'S WRONG DOING CAN BE ACHIEVED.READ THIS BOOK AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!!!
3,Unclear,"When I purchased this book I didn't see that it was for California. All the other books of this type stated CLEARLY if it was for a specific state. The title is so long that all the words just get jumbled together.Other than that, some of the information was useful in helping us to formulate questions to ask of our lawyer. Some of it was way off because the book is for California and we live in New York."
5,"Excellent guitar, smart purchase","This guitar is just excellent, is stupid paying 2,000 for a gibson when only with 199.99 you can have this one, the picture is only a shadow of this art work, the sound is good, I played a gibson before and this one is the same, when you buy a gibson you pay for a name, but an agile is good performance, I play it in my 30 watt amp and is great.I recomend this guitar to everybody, good quality, great sound, low price."
1,Inconsistent heating,I purchased this unit for its unique multipurpose features. However the heating element is completely unpredictable and cooking times inconsistent (for pizzelles between 1 and 4 minutes) so you have to stand there and monitor the thing to make sure your batch doesn't get caught in a heat surge and burn. Total and complete hassle.
2,"Good Idea, Doesn't Last","after just two or three uses, the nonstick began to bubble and peel right off of the plates and onto our food ~ i called and they sent me free replacement plates, but the same thing happened again. in the trash it goes, sadly...would have been great! maybe if it were stainless steel?"
2,Bad Instructions Lead You to have to Experiment,"By far the worst instructions I have ever attempted to read, it only gives full instructions for the Sandwich Maker part and very little or no help with the waffle and pizzelle parts to the gaget. I had to wing it..under cooking some and burning the others. I did eventually figure out timing for both pizzelles and waffles on my own but Krups instructions sucked!!!"
2,This thing is huge!,"It really is! I like Haba products, but I had to return this one. The clip is not easy to use and the whole thing is just too big :("
3,Adorable but too big,"The design is very adorable and hard to be misplaced. However, the whole chain is quite big. I bought some soothie pacifiers and the hole is way too small to loop the chain in. I managed to looped it in but the thought of removing it..it was just eaier to leave it on that specific pacifier. It works good on other pacifiers such as NUK, Playtex binky, ect... Also because it is big and bulky, sometimes the clip cannot stay put so I would recommend to buy it for your baby once he/she can hold on to it."
1,Loop is too big!,"I'm not sure if I got a defective chain or not. I have searched and in these reviews no one has mentioned the loop being too big! However I cannot get the loop at the end of the chain to stay on any of my daughter's pacifiers at all. I'm usually not slow, however I definitely cannot figure this toy out. It's cute and has a great clip and even though she's small she doesn't seem to mind the bulkiness of the chain itself, yet her's cannot be used as a pacifier holder! :("
4,"Big, but high quality","Probably should have listened to the other reviews that this was so big, but the quality is very high. It definitely will last."
5,Never lose the pacifier again!,"I love this pacifier chain and so does my daughter. The colors are bright enough that you can *always* find the pacifier. Also, the clip is very substantial and provides enough resistance that the baby can't get it off. Definitely worth the price - its very good quality!"
4,Works Great - Except for the Air Hose,"Zero complaints except the air hose they include leaks a little (which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5). Fortunately, I called Porter Cable and they sent me a new one - no charge.Nailers work exactly like they should. I've used them for trim and it actually makes it fun to put the stuff up! The compressor is indeed loud, but it's to be expected and it rarely kicks on while working.I would DEFINITELY recommend this item."
5,"Oh, the things we can build -- now!!","I bought this little compressor for my husband, never dreaming that we would learn to build so many helpful things just because of the ability to nail straight at last! In fact, we've had such fun with ours that we bought one for our son-in-law and now are buying another for our son. And it's wonderfully portable for a little work-horse--so light weight that even I don't have trouble lifting it and putting in the van. We take it everywhere."
5,Best Deal in Home Improvement,"This is quite possibly the best deal in the home improvement industry. I got tired of borrowing the compressor and nail guns from my father-in-law or brother-in-law, who both have the same kit, so I tried to find the same three components myself, thinking that I could beat their price. Even with no-name nail guns from Menards or Harbor Freight, and with a cheap plasticky compressor from Home Depot, I couldn't touch the price of this combo. Don't delay, don't bother looking for a better deal, buy this kit!"
5,Great product for the price.,I bought this kit when I first started some small woodworking projects. I have since upgraded my compressor but the nail guns are still being used. I love the Porter Cable brand and have not had any issues with the nail guns. The little compressor was very loud and doesn't have the cfm you need for some larger tools I later needed to use. It was a great product for what my needs were at the time though. I even did some drywall knockdown spraying with this compressor. It ran a lot but it got the job done. I gave it to a friend when I bought my new larger belt driven compressor. The nail guns both had hard cases to store them in.
2,Poor customer service,"I bought this kit since it seemed to be a good deal on all the air tools I needed for finish nailing (except a pin nailer). No complaints about the guns, but the compressor didn't work from day one, even though I followed PC's ""break-in"" instructions; there seemed to be a leak somewhere internally, as it never got past about 50 psi. I called PC's customer service number repeatedly over a three day period and spent hours upon hours on hold with the call never being picked up. In the end, I trashed the compressor and bought another brand, figuring that I still got a pretty decent deal on the guns.Given that experience I will never buy another Porter Cable product again and recommend looking into customer service on any brand of tool you buy - a tool that doesn't work and won't get fixed/replaced is never a good deal."
4,Good starter kit,"As with most of the reviewers here, this is my starter kit for getting into air tools. First off, this is a very good kit for the money. I got mine for $274 and free shipping. In addition, Porter Cable shipped me an air stapler gun as well, so there is no question about the value of this package. The brad and finish nailers are of a good quality and I haven't had any problems with them yet. I'm also a light user of these tools, so YMMV depending on how much you use these tools. I also bought a Porter Cable framing nailer to see if I could run it with this small compressor. The results are mixed, I'm not sure if it's my technique or the compressor, but a lot of the times the nails didn't go all the way through. All said and done, this is a good starter package, and I'd encourage any DIYer to give this a shot if they want to start using air tools."
5,Great!,I am extremely happy with this combo. Both nailers have performed flawlessly and the light weight and small size of the compressor is wonderful. I have used the brad nailer for only one small project. I installed crown molding using the finish nailer. I can't imagine having to install the molding with a hammer. I had no jams and the nails set very nicely through the molding and into the nailer that I had installed using a Porter Cable framing nailer (FR 350A).The combo arrived intact and set-up was very easy. Everything needed to get started is in the box!
2,"Satisfied, with the exception of...","My wife bought this kit because we were doing renovations. Was satisfied with nailers performance but was confused because of compressor running nonstop then dumping air tank constantly. After inspection of compressor and review of parts schematic, I realized there was no pressure switch. Let me give you some background. A pressure switch is placed in air circuit to cut power to compressor when a predetermined air pressure is reached. If switch fails to perform this task the safety valve will release air in tank to prevent over-pressurization.Compressor can function with only a safety valve, but not very efficiently. According to manual there is a pressure switch kit that can be purchased at an additional cost but I have not been able to locate one anywhere.As I said previously, it can work and I do still use it. Although, I would not have purchased this item if I would have known this."
5,Great value,"My old compressor burnt up a few weeks ago and I needed a new one. I was going to buy just a compressor only, because I already had a couple of guns, but I couldn't pass up on this great deal.Having the extra guns (being able to shoot a greater variety of nails and brads) has been a help.I like the size of this compressor, I can hook up my larger framing nail gun and it keeps up with my work (although I'm not a production framer so I'm not commenting on that).I've used both the 16 and 18 gauge guns so far and have not had any problems so I give a strong thumbs up to this whole kit, it works great and you can't beat the value."
4,"Powerfu , yet petite","I am a doctor who will become a carpenter when I retire in 30 years. I bought this to give me an air nailer in my workshop for my furniture products. Since that time, my wife and I have undertaken a major renovation on our house. This combo pack has been great. In my time off I have used this little dynamo to jump in with our framers and trim carpenters to help construct our new addition. The carpenters have even said that this compressor seems to be outperforming their $700 DeWalt. I still haven't gotten the promised stapler via rebate (going on 2-1/2 months) but I haven't quite given up hope.All in all, I can't sing the praises of this combo enough. The brad nailer and finish nailer work flawlessly and are easy to use. The compressor stands up to professional grade stuff of my contractor, all for under 300 dollars!"
4,nice kit,"complaints:the air hose is awful its rigid and short. I would like to have a nicer hose, but I only paid 130 dollars for this kit so its not really a complaint just a comment about the hose.everything else is just what you would expect."
5,Bid Time Return,"I found this book especially for comparison to the movie ""Somewhere in Time"". The movie has been a favorite of mine for years, and I wanted to compare the original writing to the film. All in all, I was extremely pleased with the book, as the movie was relatively true to its contents."
2,I Preferred the Movie,"Without rehashing what others have said, I thought ""Somewhere in Time"" was much more successful, one of the few times when a movie is much better than the book it was based on. Among many other things, my main problem was Richard Collier's characterization in the book: he comes across as a pathetic wimp--it is difficult to fathom why Elise would have been interested in him. Also, the screenplay certainly doesn't suffer from the omission of Richard's cancer as a plot element--there is a plausible explanation for his escape to Michigan (writer's block), and it makes his death all the more poignant because it is only of a broken heart, not a tumor."
5,ALWAYS IN MY HEART,"Are you the one? The question we all ask. This book is the one. It is beautifully written and the descriptions of the settings, clothing, historical timing and emotions is timeless and deeply moving. We dream of such a chance at love, with Bid Time Return, we have a chance to feel it, if only through the tender written word of Richard Matheson. I encourage all romantics to read this, it will touch you, and stay with you, until you find ""the One."""
1,"Please, read Finney instead!","Okay, I haven't read Bid Time Return, so my rating means nothing. But I read several pages exerted in Amazon's Look Inside! And oh my, does Matheson really write like that? A sort of stream of consciousness style, whatever pops into his head? Matheson's writing cannot begin to compare with Jack Finney's, one of the great sci-fi writers of all time, and one who mined the time travel sub-genre well."
3,Not as good as expected,"It is not very dry inside the wrap, especially during the summer, it is wet through and makes you uncomfortable. And I don't really think the ""technique"" will be worthy of more than 30 bucks..."
2,Good starter book for the beginner,"The book could have gotten more in depth with the subject of butchering, but overall it is still a good book for the novice butcher. I am no novice, but still picked up a tip or two."
2,Better books out there,There are better books out there such as _Gut It. Cut It. Cook It._. This book also encourages aging which is a dangerous and needless process with venison.
3,YOU ARE ALL WRONG!,"ok, I AGREE this wasnt the best piece of cinema...however.. I think it deserves more than 1 or 2 stars. I agree with the person below who stated something to the effect, if it had Dominique Swain in it, how bad could it be? I agree, and that is why I rented it on DVD.So, the box describes girls wanting to get revenge on the guys who wronged them. And yes, i agree that, although that is what the box says, that is not really what the movie is about. But its watchable. I would say its a sleeper, more about friendship...so it went a little awry in its intentions, not the first movie to do so...I say, give it a try. there are MUCH MORE UNWATCHABLE movies out there...take it from someone who has seen over 1,400 movies...I can recall a lot more than this one that were unwatchable...But thats just my opinion..."
1,What's the point of this movie?,"From the reviews, this definitely sounded like something I wanted to see. Girls taking back what's rightfully theirs from deceitful arrogant men who use women for sex. But I watched this twice and still couldn't figure out the plot. Interesting idea, but it was never developed. The girls are still weak and break down for men. The fire at the end didn't even fit with the rest of the movie and the ending was incredibly inconclusive. I felt empty and used after this movie, just like the female characters in them. It made no sense and had no substance."
1,Not Even 1 Star!,"BAD, BAD, BAD!!Yes these things happen in real life (unfortunately), but that's why we have the news.If I'd known what this film was really about I would not have rented it!But sadly there was little hint at what was to come, and what was to come was pointless!Unless you get off on seeing girls (attempt) to rape guys, play with guns, do drugs, get raped, shoot guys, set buildings on fire and then go up in flames....STAY AWAY!!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I watched this movie the other night and it was so twisted, it's about these girls who go to private school and live on campus. They decide to take revenge on many guys that they have previously had realationships with so they can prove to them what it is like to be raped. Then in the end there plan turns into a big mess that they must crawl out of."
3,I'VE SEEN WORSE,"I'm a huge Cindy Alexander fan and since her music is in this movie, I had to buy the DVD. Her music is better than the movie, but the movie really wasn't all that bad as some other reviewers have said. It's kind of a kinky idea to begin with and any ""normal"" person who is entertained by all the things they WOULDN'T DO will have a problem taking their eyes of the screen. It's like you can't help but wonder what these girls are gonna do next. The movie could have had better production value, but all in all, I was still entertained and certainly not bored. The soundtrack is great by the way - lots of cool indie artists."
2,The only thing remotely redeeming about this movie.....,"is the soundtrack, especially the songs by Cindy Alexander. Save yourself some money and go buy her cd's instead. I guess the clothes were kinda cool. Here's the clincher though....it's sooooo bad, you can't stop watching it."
1,Only Feminist would enjoy this this movie.,"If you ever wanted to know what a feminist might do, look no further than this waste of a movie that make men look like trash. Since i am not a feminist, i hate this movie because it is not even done good to enjoy it. I mean if u going to do a feminist movie, make it a good movie ok. This one has bad direction...very amaturish. I was bored to sleep.Like i said, if u r a feminist....u prolly like it regardless of how bad it was done."
1,couldn't make it through the whole movie...,"ick - just bad...too bad for words. stay far away from this, umm, I guess you could call it a movie. anymore effort in this review would be more time in my life I'll never get back."
2,Chokers!! GAG!!,"This movie is just not worth the ninety minutes it takes to watch it. While the themes are extremely compelling and worthy of being voiced...everything just always seems to fall absolutely flat.Scenes that should be incredible, are instead, dreadful as the the director fails miserably to in fact DIRECT the actors as to what to do. One scene where the girls attempt a mock rape is just silly.Basically the ideas in this movie are very interesting, but this movie is devastatingly amatuerish in its execution of the ideas. Hence they lose any power they might have, had they been given a better platform."
1,It doesn't get much worse than this,"The Smokers is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters were horrible. Anyone who thinks this is how girls really are needs to meet some new people. The so called idea of girls getting back at low life guys never really makes any sense. It seemed like the director thought she was making some female empowerment message movie, but ended up putting the charactes lower than they were to begin with. This is one DVD that should definately be avoided. Fans of Dominique Swain should stick with Lolita."
1,1 star because there is no 0,"You have to wonder a bit when a film goes straight to video...and within minutes you realize that it is a no brainer why this film did just that.It's a dreadful film, with such a promising cast that it is disappointing that you really cannot find anything good, let alone tangible, in this film.It makes a sad effort to be a feministic film but the message is muttled with horrible fashion, cliches, and a zig zag of blurry emotions.I really honestly do not understand how a previous reviewer can state that this is one of Thora Birch's best roles...They are either 13, under the thought that you must enjoy every film that your favorite actor/actress stars in, or they have never seen *American Beauty* or *Ghost World*. Thora Birch is in this movie for all of 10 maybe 15 mins.I was highly discouraged by this films lack of not only true content but intelligence."
2,There was a plot and then there was none.,"Most indie movies are bad, but in a good way. This isn't the case with ""The Smokers"". It had some interesting colorful charectors that began an interesting colorful story, then stopped before the movie ended. In conclusion, if your a Dominique Swain fan, it's worth watching. I know that Keri Lynn Pratt has a little bit of a following. Busy Phillipps hasn't done to much (Dawson's Creek, Freaks and Geeks). All in all, it's worth it if your interested in any of these three actresses. If your a Thora Birch fan, just fast forward to her 3 or 4 parts."
4,"Well, I'm a Princess.","Well, I'd pretty much say I'm a fan of this movie. At times, the acting can be kind of sucky. But it's an interesting plot, the characters are cool, and they have cool outfits. I find it pretty stupid, though, for people to say they don't like it because of the quality of the filming. It's SUPPOSED to be filmed like that, and I think it enhances the movie. Overall, it's a pretty cool movie...I mean, it's not the same kind of mindless teenager movie we always see. At least it isn't just another teen movie. (I appologize for the terrible media reference) But, seriously, it's one of the 10 or so movies that doesn't make fun of The Matrix, or some other movie...besides, I love how Thora Birch wears those painted on masks..."
1,Just plain bad,"I have to say that even though these things may happen; this movie failed to present it in a light that made it even a little interesting. The characters were poorly developed. You never really began to relate to any of them. The cinematography was probably the worst I've ever seen. You could actually see where film was overlaid in the fire scene. What was said didn't match to what you just watched. The fire started in the bathroom but you see it engulfing the bedroom; although according to narration only the bathroom was affected! Huh!! Even if you could make some sense out of that whole scene, why bother. This movie was a complete waste of film. For a DVD the video was terrible; the soundtrack was even worse. Give your money to a beggar! You'll get more satisfaction and didn't waste 90 minutes of your life!!"
1,Poor quality,"Beware this juicer. When I received mine the motor worked for about 30 seconds, and then ... nothing. When I looked into having it repaired, the nearest service facility was about 45 minutes from where I live. I ended up returning it to Amazon (not a hassle, they even link you to a UPS pre-paid return label), but I wasn't credited until Amazon had it for a week. By that time, my credit card bill had come due so I had to pay for it, although I now have a negative balance.Once again, beware ..."
1,This ripped while putting it on!,"For some reason, the pink material was thinner and flimsier than the blue, green, or black covers I purchased. It ripped really easily and I never got to use it!"
1,Perils of Pauline,"I was looking for the movie of this program. My error I thought this was it. For what type of film it was I suppose it was good, just not at all what I was looking for."
3,greed is the universal killer,"This novel was well written, in the style usually favored by Mr. Brunner. There is almost no description of the surroundings or the background of the characters, except Ian, so that is why the novel is about 200 pages.The most interesting precept in this book is that an human could get to think like an alien under the right circumstances. This passage is very well done.They finally understand how a civilization was wiped out and you will see that this future could happen to us if we are not vigilant toward the biogeneticians.Greed is a part of our nature, so we must put every effort in our reasonning."
1,Lasted 3 years and blew-up !,"The controls and beeps were a little annoying but tolerable. Though we did use it quite often (almost every day),I would have expected it to last more than 3 years. While in use a heating element blew up nearly causing a fire!"
1,just awful,"didn't purchase the toaster oven from amazon, but to pay a small fortune for something that you think will last more than a year and we've had nothing but problems. The handle broke off in less than a week. The clock stopped functioning, and lastly the top 2 heating elements are gone. This is supposedto be a ProChef oven---can't even be an amature with this hunk of junk!"
1,This toaster stinks. Don't buy it.,We have had this toaster for less than 2 years. The bottom coil just went out. Save your money and buy something else.
4,Good Chisels,I've been using the Stanley chisels for several months and have no complaints. They are durable and well made. They bite (which is a good thing). The handles are well made and will not fall apart like cheaper stuff.
5,twenty years later i still love her books,"it is indeed surprising that enid blyton doesnt seem to be in vogue any longer, infact her books which made many a long summer afternoon fly are not even available today. her variuos mystery and adventure series, incl famous five, secret seven, five findouters, the adventure series starring kiki the talking parrot, the r's mystery series with miranda the monkey and snubby the scallywag, and ofcourse her inimitable school stories the St Claires and Malory Towers and all timeless classics whcih i enjoy even today. i will be happy to chat to like minded readers"
2,Was unclear that this is the original (old) etiquette,"Good book if you're curious about early 1900s etiquette, but mostly does not apply. Quality poor -- looks like was copied from original text."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"There is no other poet who can capture the beauty in the world as wonderfully as Keats. Knowledge of his early death, and the noble grace with which he embraced his fate, only make his poetry more poignant."
3,Prime Fun,Some would call it a poor man's War Games but I call it fun. A sleeper to most people since it didn't have the appeal of larger production movies like War Games and Short Circuit. Any fans of those movies probably won't be disappointed.Well worth a couple hours of your time. The premise is some bad guys want to take over the Federal Reserve computer system. While a couple students try to make off with some quick cash from an ATM using their computer skills they discover a plot to destroy the monetary system.Unfortunately this movie is not available on VHS or DVD in the US at this time. Hopefully someone will put it out on DVD soon. I would much rather watch this than a number of other movies they dredged up to put on DVD.
4,DVD ASAP!!!,One of the best movies of the eighties in my opinion. Overlooked by most but definatley worth releasing on DVD! PLEASE PUT THIS MOVIE OUT ON DVD!
4,"Not bad, but the problems are more than just mere annoyances","This book really does offer some solid studying tips and it contains a number of mock questions, which is very useful. However, there are some problems, such as that many of the pages are just plain crooked; that is, it's as though some less-than-conscientious person photocopied pages while telling someone about his/her weekend and didn't pay close attention to the job at hand. It's a little off-putting. Also, I found at least one instance where the answer simply wasn't listed anywhere. And in at least one other question, there were two answers that were exactly the same. This is no reflection on Mr. Martinson, save that it's his name on the cover. It means some pretty sloppy editing went on while the book was being put together."
1,It won't let me give negative stars,"I bought this unit for my son after his brother read about its superior sound. A little hard to compare because it doesn't work at all. Never did!I've been trying to get my money back for 3 months. After 2 days on the phone, all they gave me was long distance toll number to call. After quizzing me to make sure I knew how to install a battery and turn it on, I was given an address in St. Louis that I must send it to at my expense. I specifically asked for a return number. The rep assured me that they did not use them. Their facility wouldn't accept it.It sat in a St. Louis Post Office till February waiting for them to pick it up. I was later told that I had listened to a inexperienced customer rep. I mentioned that it was the exact same address listed for returns on their website! Here's the best part. They denied my return because I didn't return it within 30 days.I have resent it, again, at my expense to their Fla. facility.Still no refund, no explanation."
2,This player is cheap.,"I thought Alienware had something great with this player. I was wrong. Out of the box the player operated fine at the inital start up, but when I tested the EQ button the player shut down. This did not happen each time I pushed this button, but enough to warrent me returning to the vendor (not Amazon). I tried Alienware support but received no response, tried again in 24 hours, still no response three days later (disappointing).Sound from the player was great, FM radio worked good. I did not try the SD expansion slot. Plastic case will become a problem, I could see the battery lid breaking after repeated use. This player was made to be thrown away at the end of it's (short) life.I would not recommend this player for purchase."
1,Beware of Alienware,"If the product works properly then it is probably ok, but not in the league of an IPOD. Like all Alienware products it is far more style than substance.But if you need tech support - watch out! They will do everything they can to convince you it's your fault even when it never worked properly in the first place. They will try to talk you through getting it to operate properly, but they will do nothing that costs them money to fix it."
1,the wrong AWG was sent,"We paid for a 30 - 20 AWG stripper, they sent us a 24 - 10 AWG stripper. We are not going to return it as it's going to cost us more time and money."
3,one of the better books about shakespear on screen,"every year there are 3 - 5 new adaption of Shakespear-plays for the silverscreen. Good written book but not the lexica-type reference work. Only a few pictures. a complete filmographie with credits is unfortunately missing. other books about Shakespear on screen: ""Shakespeare on Film"" by Robert Shaughnessy; ""Shakespeare in the Movies: From the Silent Era To The Present Day"" by Douglas Brode, ""Shakespeare, the Movie"" by Lynda E. Boose"
3,Cute But Hurt,"These shoes are very cute and the picture does them justice. However, they do rub in weird places, so keep band-aids handy until you have them broken in. In fact, the first day I wore them was a month ago and wasn't prepared with band-aid ... needless to say, I am wearing them again today for a second time (it took that long for the weird rubbed spots to heal)."
5,Great CD,This CD is awesome. If you are from Dallas and like 97.1 make sure you get it! If you aren't from Dallas and like alternative music I highly recommend it!
2,Not worth much...,"I was sorely disappointed with this little booklet. I was able to read it in about three minutes. That's not my idea of a worthwhile book.I suppose you could describe this as a children's book, which is the only potential defense of its publication. However, it's not marketed to children, and I think it's intended to be inspirational to adults.It's cute, and the message is true. But it's too simple, too saccharine, and too short for my taste.Though this may seem like a nice Christmas gift book, but I'd recommend finding something more substantial."
5,Amazing find,"After hearing this recording, I think almost anybody would be amazed that 18th-century music of this quality can still be found that has never been recorded before. Every aspect of good symphonic writing--orchestration, figuration, lyricism, virtuosity--was clearly mastered by this composer. The best movements are worthy of Haydn or Mozart. The London Mozart Players have a crisp, accurate, and energetic way of playing that showcases the music beautifully."
1,Dust collec tor -posing as a air sander.,Useless if your air compressor out put is not 15 cfpm at 90PSI. Amazon did not put this in their add. That why the price is low. I will probably give it to my son. He has a 2 stage air compressor that mighft handle it. My air compressor out put is 10 cfpm at 90 PSI. Other air sanders take a lot lower CFPM. I went back to my electric sander.
3,Too Small for the Tall,"Pay close attention to the dimensions of this product. I just got this product yesterday, and it seems VERY SMALL for my 4 year-old Spiderman fanatic. Even my 2 year old has trouble fitting on it (we are a family of 90%ers for height and weight). This is NOT a child's size sleeping bag attached to the sofa -- it is about the size of an infant's small receiving blanket. The manufacturer's recommended ages go up to five, but I would not buy it for more than an average-sized 3 year-old. I wanted to return it, but because the package is ""oversized,"" I already paid over $12 for shipping, and would have to pay return shipping as well."
4,Good movie,"I think this was a good movie. It has a good story, it is handled in a way that it is easy to follow the movie, and suspense is always there.As many thriller movie, it has crime, drug, murder; in other words it is a very realistic movie.*Sponsored Post"
1,fraud?,"I was considering buying this product, but came across info at iigwest(dot com)/investigations/aulterra/2006_aulterra(dot)html that was very interesting that you might want to read before buying...even if you are using them...i wouldn't feel safe with these things everywhere."
1,bogus,"Applied neutralizer to two different cell phones. No noticble effect on EMF. Have used other very effective products, and was looking for a smaller product. This is smaller but does not work."
1,This product did not work for me,"Soon after I attached on of these stickers to my cell phone, I began receiving unwanted calls, mostly 'restricted' or 'unavailable', at least 35 calls in one day. I took the sticker off my phone and quit receiving these calls."
3,Am I missing something?,Is there a way of sticking these circles on a computer/ phone? I assumed they were stickers. It's kind of disappointing and inconvenient if they don't even stick.Update: I now see that there is a sticker layer which I missed earlier. I've raised the score to 3 stars as I don't currently have an opinion on whether this works or not. Will update again at a later date.
1,Never Received,"Well, I'd like to write a good review but I never received the product. I bought it some time back and forgot about it. I contacted the seller today so hopefully will hear back from them. I hope they come through for me. As my uv and radiation sensitivities are really kicking in right now. If so, I will come back to write a good review - at least for the follow-up from them."
3,Odd,"I bought these, and I still think there is something strange on how EVERYONE gave these a 5 star.Of course they will probably delete this review like they deleted my other one...but i'm just saying.. this may or may not work. and it's odd how all the dates for all these ""real"" customers are all placed november 2006. Then, when I wrote a review 2 years later about that ( feb 2008), a more recent "" march 19th 2008"" review got put on there.Why do none of these people show up ( in detail) when trying to find these customers and their history? it's almost as if.. ( draw your own conclusion )odd."
2,Strange Effects,"When I placed this device on my TV I think it worked too well, suddenly I was unable to receive any digital TV stations, only analogue broadcast through the air. As soon as I removed the sticker my TV worked properly again. I had a similar effect with my cell phone, I was unable to receive calls until I removed the sticker.These things work TOO well"
3,Good Show,"Pretty much a must-have for the musical buff. High points: Audrey Landers, several good dancing numbers, Michael Douglas. Negatives: A bit on the campy side at times, but still a fun movie to watch."
3,"Please, just the song and dance","Spectacular. . .when there is singing and dancing; tedious (pretentious, trite, self-absorbed. . .so 1980's) when there is talking. Fast forward through Michael Douglas and you have yourself an enjoyable movie."
3,"Fun movie, very true to life of a dancer","Considering I have never seen the Broadway show, I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. The songs were fun, the dancing fantastic, the acting was relatively good, and I thought the plot would have been very good without the Cassie/Zach relationship being thrust into the limelight. Many people did not like ""Surprise, Surprise,"" due to its replacing of an original song. However, I thought Gregg Burge did an absolutely amazing job with it. His dancing was so high-energy and almost technically impeccable. No complaints there. I loved: ""Dance Ten, Looks Three"", ""Nothing"", ""Hello Twelve"", and ""At the Ballet."" My one major complaint with this movie is Cassie. I felt she was annoying, she detracted from several of the musical numbers with absolutely pointless shots of her sitting in a chair, and I didn't enjoy her songs very much. Other than that, good movie, and hopefully I will get to see the Broadway show sometime."
1,Not Faithful,"I saw the Broadway show several times and loved it. The movie is overblown and is not faithful to the original Broadway production. The dancing is great, Michel Douglas' performance is way over the top and the singing is fair at best. What a disapointment. Attenborough should have remained faithful to the original script and characterizations."
4,A Chorus Line,"I saw the film many many years a go and I fell in love with the lirics and finelly I saw it last year in Broadway, I'm so happy that finally I have it."
2,the movie,"I like the plot and the music there was something missing in the casting.Cassie wasn,t as good as the stage version."
1,No legs for this dog,"Please avoid this film at all costs! Even a second-rate touring company would be a better bet for experiencing this classic musical. Having nary a clue about the larger themes of this drama, director Attenborough thoroughly pummelled this show into a dreadful, hammy production."
4,a very true depiction of broadway life.,A good musical for anyone who ever wanted to be on the stage to see. It tells the truth.
4,Chorus Line DVD,The movie is great; however a sequence where BeBe is asked to demonstrate a solo is missing.
2,A Great Musical Destroyed by Hollywood,"A Chorus Line is one of my all-time favorite musicals. The trash job done on this movie version is criminal. From the casting of Michael Douglas as the director to the expansion of the storyline to cutting some of the best production numbers.Richard Attenborough tried and failed to make this movie more than what it ever could be. The expansion of the storyline is to me a collosal waste of time, it's about the audtion. Produstion numbers should have been lengthened not shortened and then the new numbers would have been ok.The only bright spot in this entire movie Allyson Reed in the role of Cassie.Since this is the only opportunity for most folks to see a least a pseudo-version of the musical, it's not really an option not to see it at least once. The music and production numbers work, and even though there is nothing like live theatre the score is great and I love a good production number."
4,We didn`t get many musicals in the 80s...,"but fortunately Richard Attenborough gave us this(a long way from Gandhi indeed)... It is a 80s treatment of the show, but the talent is a treasure to behold. The cast-director of CHICAGO should have seen this and put real musical-talent in the leads...The finale, One, brings tears to the eyes... IT`S A SHOWSTOPPER INDEED:-)))))))))))"
1,Chorus line dvd,Not within region. Should have been told in ad. I had to return it. So disappointed that it did not work in Kansas
4,Great Movie,This has always been a favorite movie. Love the dancing and music is great. Also like seeing how young everyone is.
4,I love it!!,"I am very unfortunate because I was not lucky enough to see the Broadway version of this musical, but I feel that the movie was a really good view of what to expect. The casting was very interesting, and I have to admit that I like the movie version of ""Music & the Mirror"" better than the actual Broadway recording. It's just my opinion. For someone who hasn't seen the actual show, I think the film was great. Someone needs to revive it man!! I'd love to see it up on the stage."
4,This is an amazing musical! Definitely one of my favorites!,"I am completely obssessed with this movie! I've only known of it for less than a few months, and yet I've watched it so many times I know the dance moves off by heart. It is a movie that is so easy to get into! Immediately you begin to see the genius behind it that makes you decide who are your favorite characters and favorite parts! Some people may think that a bunch of people trying out for a Chorus Line may not be such a great plot, but this movie pulls it off with such style and charm you immediately love it! The musical numbers are great! The dancing is ... undescribable! It is truly one of the best examples I've seen of transferring a musical to video. (Or was it video to musical?)I have seen both : stage and video, and I have to say it is truly one of the most inspiring musicals I've ever seen! It is a musical with a heart."
2,A CHORUS LINE's music is one singular sensation!,"A CHORUS LINE is both a disappointment and a wonderful movie! A disappointment because it absolutely butchered the original Broadway production...I mean come on they butchered the songs ""Hello Twelve! Hello Thirteen! Hello Love!"", ""Music and the Mirror"", and ""What I Did For Love"" from the BWay production. I mean come on ""Surprise! Surpirse!"" instead of ""Hello Twelve...""? And what is up with the song Cassie sings...a mixture of ""Music and the Mirror"" and their own edition?"
5,A Chorus Line,Saw the revival in Oct 2006 and have been listening to the CD every weekend ever since. Superb musical as was the original.
2,different than the play,"If you have seen A Chorus Line the play, and are looking for its equal this is not for you. This movie is a little like the play, with the plot and all but it adds songs and dances and it takes out songs. I personally was very dissapointed."
2,The movie that killed the movie musical,"This was one of the last movie musicals, until recently, for good reason. It's terrible. The genre was on it's last leg, and this movie put the final nail in the coffin. After ""A Chorus Line"" the movie, the only musicals you saw on screen were made for television. The soundtrack replaced the musical. But this was the first musical I ever saw and it did introduce me musicals, so I have to give it credit for that. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to look back on it today and reflect on how terrible the movie is compared to the countless other movie and theatrical musicals I've seen. The music is wonderful but that had nothing to do with the filmmakers, so they can't get credit for that. Since the music is so great I would suggest you buy the original cast recording from Broadway, and wait until it comes to your city. If you feel the need see the movie, rent it, don't buy it."
5,Wonderful music and story,I had not seen this movie in many years. I really wanted to add it to my collection.The music is awesome. I really enjoyed watching it after so many years. This is one of the great musicals. Great buy and awesome value for the money spent.
5,Best Movie for your morals,"This movie has everything about life, Love and the Pursuit of working for what you get . We should all take notes on you only deserve what you work hard for. I mean sweat and determination is the way to your dreams."
2,"Horrible, Horrible Film Adaptation...","I watched this in theater class years ago, and even without knowing how completely botched this film was from its original source, it grated on my nerves. Actually, the Cassie/Zach stuff grated. It should have been kept in the background like it was in the original production.The other numbers were okay, which is why I gave it two stars, but making this a romantic love story, as opposed to one about the love of art, really cheapens the film. Such a shame, really."
1,Don't bother!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Forget the fact that it is so completely off base with the musical, it just sucks as a movie. If you're going to make a movie based on a musical, how about hiring people who can sing? Michael Douglas is the only actor in the movie with any talent and I would think he'd be embarrassed to have this in his repertoire."
2,A Chorus Line,"Why on earth can't Hollywood follow the book. They have butched so many famous books, where would you begin to name them. With the Exception of ""Gone with the Wind"" which follows the book,at least the movie is GREAT.For instance take ""Midnight In The Garden of Evil"" A book, you can't put down. It actually put Savannah on the must see attraction of the 1990's.Clint Eastwood took the book and just absolutely destroyed the plot the characters, you name it and he killed them all.When I saw the movie I couldnt believe how far he had left the storyline some where on the out skirts of Savannah.Outside of Kevin Spacey no one character resemebled the books characters...To put a Jude Law as a male husler was laughable. He was too thin ....hell, he didnt even look Like Jude Law looks today."
3,They've Changed Things Around,"The musical on stage was perfect in every way, however, due to the fact that it did not have a main character (everyone in the show gets their own division of small, but equal, spotlight), it did not appeal to everyone. So they changed it around a bit and made the story behind Zach and Cassie center-ring in this circus. And because so, the movie had lost much of it's appeal. It still is a good story, but a true fan of A Chorus Line will find this movie disappointing."
1,Wait for a stage production,"I was fortunate enough to perform in the stage production of ""A Chorus Line"" back in the day, and we were all really excited when the Movie was finally coming out...until we saw it.This film misses on virtually every count, not capturing anything that made the musical special and unique. Has-been choreographer of the moment Hornaday practically destroyed any style this film could've had, and the casting of talentless ""names"" like Judy the Bimbo from ""Dallas"" only made things even more hideous.Michael Bennett, the original creator of ""Chorus Line"" felt that there was no way it could adequately be made into a film...it looks like he was right. Don't waste your money, and withhold your opinion about this show until you can see it for real, on a stage."
1,The worst musical ever made,I felt embarassed that a quality actor of Michael Douglas's capability was ever coerced into taking part in this totally amateurish rubbish. While the other participants were never heard of again fortunately it did no sustainable damage to the career of the star of the film
3,a chorus line,"I was not all that impressed with this video. I saw the original on broadway and was disappointed that they cut some great songs, changed the presentation on others and added one or two new songs....all this so they could redirect the focus to more dance numbers, i guess to balance the production and give it better mass appeal. All in all, while entertaining, i preferred the original broadway show."
3,Not nearly as Good as the Broadway show but decent.,"Good movie and music. Fans of the Original Broadway show may be dissapointed to find their favorite songs cut, and the dialougue messed with."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A Chorus Line is a classic example of something working on stage but not on screen--the musical was a revolutionary piece of musical theater, but the movie just feels uninspired and ordinary; the film may be of interest to those who like musicals, but it's not very accomplished."
4,glitzy Entertainment,If you like theater you will like Chorus Line. Was a bit vulgar in places but it is rated for that.
1,Very Weak,"Extremely uninspired film adaptation of the entertaining but largely plotless stage success about dancers auditioning for a place in the chorus line. Music is much the same, but the energy is zero and the show doesn't really translate well to film. Give it a miss."
2,"Some decent moments, but...","If you genuinely enjoyed the original show and the real meaning behind the story, do NOT buy or rent this movie.The choreography was decent at times, and of course the score is great, but the meaning of what I consider the centerpiece number of the show, ""What I Did for Love"", is totally changed to a love song. This is NOT meant to be a ""love song"" in the traditional sense, but a song about the love of theatre and dance. And the romance between Cassie and Zach is not suppose to be the focal point of the show.They would have been far better off to have simply video taped the show on stage!"
3,No Spanish!,"I have purchased two other Peep boxed sets, and one other solo Peep DVD, and they have ALL had the Spanish language option, so I was INCREDIBLY disappointed to receive these and discover that there was no Spanish language option (other than subtitles, which isn't much help since my 4-year-old is barely learning to read). I don't understand why they changed the format - we are a bilingual household (as are many others), so not having the Spanish option was hugely disappointing. I was also annoyed by the commercials at the beginning. You have to skip through them (cannot hit the 'menu' option). The other DVDs did not have commercials.As far as the quality of the show, well if you are familiar with Peep and the Big Wide World, then you know they're all OUTSTANDING. No complaints there - it delivers as it always does. Shame about the changes though... :("
2,Disappointed,"I like many others have had a Checkbook calculator in the past and loved it. I was looking forward to getting a new one for Christmas. It has a nice soft touch key pad. And keeps 3 account records. However the keys were unresponsive (sticky keys). Sometimes when keys were pressed they worked and other times they did not. Amazon was great and sent me another one to try and it had the same problem so I had to return it. I haven't read others reporting this problem so perhaps this defect will be corrected. If so, I would buy it again. But not sure if the problem is fixed or not."
4,Well made with just one flaw,"Like the new calculator, feels sturdy and no problem with all the function keys.However the (for lack of a better word) adhesive holding the calculator to the wallet only lasted one day. Luckily I had some velcro squares and it is now fixed. They need to put a piece of velcro on the Calaculator and on the wallet to hold them securely together."
4,This is a Must-Have For Me,"I rely heavily on a checkbook calculator, and have owned several through the years. I was glad to find this one at a great price. My only complaint is the buttons don't always register the amount, and I have to start again from the beginning. I wish Datexx would design a calculator with a floating decimal point. Had one of those years ago but haven't found one since. Would be so much easier!"
1,poor,"This calculator lasted a whole 3 weeks. The display was broken up and unreadable. I tried retting, new battery, and anything else i could think of. nothing helped. Don't waste your money on this one..."
1,Not received,"I was on vacation when the Datexx DB-412 Checkbook Calculator FEDEX tried to deliver, was returned to sender. Deed to have it resent to my address. We are back from vacation.Regards,Stan Paplauskas"
2,calulater,The checkbook calulater does not stay attached to the small strip of velcro on the cover.No velcro on the back of the calulater.
2,Cannot Delete Wrong Entries,"I purchased the DATEXX checkbook calculator to help my wife track her deposits and checks. When setting the calculator up by entering recent purchases and deposits, I was amazed to find that the calculator did not have a function to delete an inaccurate entry. You have to reset the calculator or put an opposite entry to cancel out the incorrect one. I'll be looking for a more useful checkbook calculator."
4,Calculator plus,"This checkbook calculator not only tracks your balance, but provides the date and time as well. Can follow three different accounts with this product. Didn't receive five stars because one time when I opened it I was greeted by a ""blackened screen"". It still worked, but was difficult to view with the blackened background. Thought I was going to have to send it back, but the next time I used it it was fine."
1,"numerals are very dim, even after new batteries","I just started using this calculator on June 30th, after the old one quit.When pressing the numbers, they get very dim, even after new batteries are put in it. If it is held at a certain angle, the numbers can be read, but other wise it is not readable most of the time.I wish there were more selection of checkbook calculators the cheaper model(DB403) was a better calculater. I might buy another one because when using it, I can keep better account of checks/account balance with a checkbook calculator./Thank You,Thomas W Bennett"
2,"Great gadget, but didn't last a year.","I bought this to replace one I had had for years (bought at Office Depot). This Datexx didn't last a year. I will buy one, next time, with little solar cells (like my previous one). I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."
5,Just what he was looking for!,"I had no idea that these things existed, but when he asked for one, I went searching. This checkbook calculator was EXACTLY what he was looking for - my old school boyfriend - checks fit inside, and calculator does the math..... just like the registers!!!!"
3,Could last longer,"It works well although my wife won't use it. Had the checkbook 2 years and the display on stopped working. I would hope it would last longer, considering I have calculators that last 10 years"
1,bad bad item,"The numbers do not register right, putTeledex DB-413 Checkbook Calculator-Tracks Latest Savings, Checking, Credit Financial Entriesin 8 you get 9, etc. New battery did not help. This product is junk."
4,yes!,"This book takes you through the art of astral travel like noother,with the exception of Robert Monroe's 1st book.If you want a fun read, this is it!It also works!Good info here."
4,muy bueno,te permite entender con facilidad por estar escrito en un lenguaje sencillo y va directo al punto
1,"Too bloated,repetitive and unoriginal to be of any value.","Only 3 seperate techniques for projecting are discussed and way to much soliciting for students.Also bloated with theoretical,unprovable and improbable occult ideas which detract from the straight-forward discussion and elaboration of techniques.Dont waste your money."
2,No thought went into this,"First of all, I love Edwards. Here's the problem with this devotional. Many entries have little substance. I got the feeling the publisher just randomly chose paragraphs from Edward's sermons, and pasted them in there!Many entries say a bunch of nothing. It's as if the publisher closed their eyes, ran their mouse cursor over a sermon, copied a section, opened their eyes, then pasted it on the blank sheet for a days entry.You'd be better off to just go buy a book of Edward's sermons and read a paragraph or two of it a day.Try buying Charity and It's Fruits or His book on knowing Christ.This devotional, is just a bunch of meaningless, unthought out excerpts."
4,Curious George movie review,This movie is a really cute story about a monkey who is just curious but gets into a whole lot of trouble. I think small children can really relate to it well and it has a happy ending.
3,Cute movie with a classic favorite character,"We took my soon to see Curious George in the theater for his third birthday. He paid attention to it for the first half. Then the lack of action started to bore him. We bought the DVD for him for Christmas and he's watched it once. He likes it, but it doesn't have enough going on to keep his attention (Cars was his favorite this year because of its fast pace). My husband and I thought it was a sweet movie, but I wouldn't recommend it for children under 6 if they, like my son, have a hard time sitting still if there isn't a lot of action."
5,A sweet movie,"My almost-two year old loves this movie. She keeps asking to see ""George"" over and over again and I've seen it with her a few times already. A very sweet movie, fun story, lovable characters, good dialogue, great music, no violence and even no scary villains unlike many cookie-cutter children's movies. Will Ferrel is great as the voice of the Man in the Yellow Hat."
2,Not HD,"I streamed this movie from Amazon On Demand to watch with my daughter. I chose the HD version over the standard definition version. The movie started off in high definition. I then had to stop the movie for my daughter. Once I restarted the movie it was no longer in HD. After the movie, I cut it off and then started a movie on Netflix wich played in HD the whole time. I paid extra for the HD quality but I did not receive it."
3,Not as good as I was hoping,"My 3 yr old son likes the movie, but it was a disappointment to me. The storybooks focus on George the monkey, but the movie seemed to focus more on Will Ferrell's character."
4,Curious George,"My 3 year old twin(boy/girl)grandchildren saw this as their first movie experience. I took them to the theater by myself not knowing what to expect. Since my grandson has had a 3 foot stuffed Curious George since birth, I knew they would be familar with the character. They were enchanted by the movie and sat through the entire production.My grandson even cried when george was captured. We have seen it 2 more times in the theater(on rainy days) and can't wait for it to be released on DVD...PLEASE!!"
1,Not Enough George,"Not a great video for toddlers or anyone who is all about George. This movie is all about the Man With the Yellow Hat and not about George. I was so disappointed. We love the show on PBS, but I could not wait for this to be over, and we ended up fast forwarding through most of it because my son wanted to see more George (and he was just a supporting character in this). The best part was the very beginning where George was playing with animals. Down hill from there."
3,Gift for Grandson,He loves Curious George but hasn't seen the movie yet. Something new to add to the library. And it came in plenty of time for Christmas.
4,Fun movie,What's not to like?! Cute main character acts naughty but is redeemed at the end. My three year old loves Curious George.
5,George rocks!,"My daughter loves Curious George on PBS, but hadn't seen the movie. She enjoyed it greatly! Definitely one we'll be buying in the future!"
3,Sound skips,"The sound on the dvd skips in and out which makes it annoying to watch. It could be just my copy, cute show otherwise."
4,Great kids movie,"I watch this film with my four-year-old and two-year-old daughters. We enjoyed it very much. It was a little cheesy at times, but for the most part it was enjoyable film and had a heartwarming message."
3,Product in good shape,"The product got to me a little later than I expected it would. The box was cracked on the outside in two places. The DVD was in great shape and plays wonderfully. Overall, I am satisfied."
3,Not my favorite George,"If you are a fan of the PBS show than this one is a little harder to watch. I couldn't get used to Will Ferrell, although he did a fine job. This movie was before the man with the yellow hat found George. I think it bothered my daughter, she wanted me to stop it and put on the TV show after 30 minutes.The texture of the animation was just weird too. It felt like they put in way to may shadows.If this is your first introduction to George I am sure it would be watchable but for me, I will stick with the PBS shows and CG2: Follow that monkey.just a taste preference."
5,Five stars from a little guy's point of view,"There are moments of humor in this that even make an adult laugh. I have taken my 2 year old grandson to see this movie three times. He adores it, watches it with rapt attention, and thinks it is hilarious. I'm not sure why it is such a huge hit with him, but it is."
1,I Dunno,"It was okay, I guess. I don't think it's story was very good and it doesn't go follow the old storys of Curious Georges classic books (I'm very fond of). It was pretty disapointing. We thought it would be the storys put together but instead, the totally changed the story (I don't like it when movies do that). It was very un-funny most of the time and sometimes almost boring. I don't think it is worth the money."
3,Curious George DVD (ISBN 1-4170-2650-2),"Hi,I have purchased two new Curious George widescreen DVD movies. Neither DVD will play the movie on my Onkyo DV-CP701 DVD player. I have >350 other movies in my collection (many from Universal as well) and everything in my collection plays fine except Curious George. The previews will play, the Curious George menu comes up and when I press ""Play"" the blue rating screen comes up, but in the hand-off to the next screen the problem occurs. The screen goes blank and stays there. I've let it sit for >10 minutes and still blank. Has anyone else seen this issue?shane *** at *** yarbrough *** dot *** net"
2,Curious George 1 movie,"The quality of the file is terrible. Dont buy this movie. Buy Curious George 2 instead, my son loves this movie."
4,My son likes it,It's a fun cartoon to watch. My son likes it and learned a thing or two from George.
4,Good Clean Fun!,Curious George is a highly entertaining movie for family of all ages. It is geared toward small children but older children and parents will all be entertained. I love that I can let my kids set down with this movie and not worry about irritating habits or phrases that can be repeated over and over.Good clean fun!!!
5,A delight for children and parents alike,"A wonderful experience for the family. The film combines a captivating story, memorable characters, and dazzling animation to delight children and parents alike. Pass out the popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the humourous antics of George as he discovers life in the Big City isn't much different from his native jungle."
4,Good movie -- but WARNING! DVD may not play.,"This is one of the best movies for my kids to watch, as good ol' Curious George hasn't a shred of violence or cruelty in him. Unlike just about every other ""for kids"" cartoon available.And yet, it's George's positive traits that make him so endearing: he's happy, positive, energetic, adventurous, and affectionate. His stories have a very safe, fun mood to them, so it was not surprising that this DVD was my childrens' new favorite.Sadly, however, my kids' TV is an old DVD/TV combo (a Toshiba model MD20FL1) -- and the movie came up as a green scramble. I think this is because Univeral is using some kind of new Macrovision encryption to stop DVD copying, but the result was that the kids had to either watch it on our main TV (keeping me from my football games), or on my laptop (small screen).So, please consider this when buying this DVD: it may not work on your old DVD player."
2,Not like the show at all!!! Would be a cute movie otherwise.,"This movie was very different from the show! The only 2 things that were the same is that fact that there is a monkey named George and a Man with the Yellow Hat. The Man is very negative and somewhat mean in the movie, while in the show he is super kind and doesn't get upset. In the show he cares for George and in the movie about 3/4ths of the movie is about how much he doesn't like George and doesn't want him around. My kids LOOOVE the show but did not care for this movie, and neither did I."
2,Not as good as pbs,"We watch a lot pf pbs. My daughter likes Curious George and Martha Speaks, and I like Word Girl ( actually pretty funny and somewhat subversive). Good: 1. It is longer than the 15 minute segments presented in the 30 minute pbs shows. 2. We learn the name of the man in the yellow hat: Ted. Bad: 1. There is the element of evil and deception, specifically with the museum owner's son. The animation is clearly more CG oriented. Call me old school , but I like the look of hand animation. 3. The music ( Jack Johnson?) gets on my nerves after a while."
2,"Corny jokes, lame story",I liked the animation and the music but the story line and the dialogue were just plain corny and lame. The Bloomsberry characters are just weird. The plot is unbelievable (even for a cartoon). I don't like the way George is portrayed - more naughty and annoying than curious. I think the PBS version is much much better.
2,rate of Curious george,It is very boring and cannot keep the attention of a 3 year old. Not at all interesting. Very disappointed
1,Broke just like other reviews mentioned,"Very cute and even came with a mini figurine but the back of the watch fell off on the second day, exposing the battery. The clasp also kept coming loose and falling off my sons hand, now it's lost."
4,Cute Movie,"*Curious George* was a cute movie. Overall, I enjoyed it. It was a simple storyline with George, along with his curiosity, getting himself and the man in the yellow hat in trouble. Anyways, I had a couple of good laughs.Even though this movie was geared towards kids, you could pick up a couple of lines that were meant for adults.It was a bit puzzling to see Ted (the man in the yellow hat) as a goofball. Nonetheless, it worked well into the movie....and George named after George Washington?!?!?Anyways, like I said, cute movie that anyone will enjoy."
5,Very true to the book.,"This a very well done remake of a children book. It kept thing simple with the basic idea of George being curious (running into trouble/ adventure) in search for the Man in the Yellow Hat. I never felt the storyline or voice-acting were every over the top like the Cat in the Hat. Not as fanatic as CG and other animations coming out this days. I would recommend this as a solid family movie.DVD problem:There is some issue with this movie on older DVD set in which it does not play or freeze/ skip. This is very annoying base on a new type of encoding.Why did I watched a children movie, just curious how George has grown? Curious George doesn't talk if you were wondering, but the Man in the Yellow Hat does."
1,DVD does not work,"I purchased this DVD as a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old granddaughter in another state. The DVD did not work. My daughter returned it and requested a replacement. Although Amazon was quick to replace it, this one does not work either. Very dissapointing for a 3 yr old child. I'm instructing my daughter to return this one and request a refund."
1,Very Disappointed,"We live overseas and have to wait 3-6 months to receive items we order that come via a shipment. When we received this, our children were so sad. The DVD had other movies copied over the top and the underlying movie wasn't the Curious George movie advertised. The DVD label was for the Curious George movie with the voice of Drew Barrymore, but the DVD didn't have this movie on it."
3,It's ... OK,"As unlike as the books as possible - the Man in the Yellow Suit a slapstick 'hero'? Puleese! - -Curious George- is a so-so movie adaptation.At 1 point, Curious George is wafted aloft by helium baloons, & tMitYS grabs several balloons & a kite [to steer by] & races after George. &, for 1 brief thrilling sequence, -Curious George- fills all the promises made by the film.Unfortunately, he &tMitYS; son return to the earth & leaden plot. But, O when he soars...!"
2,Something Little Kids *Might* Enjoy,"I couldn't get into this movie. It was boring, too long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over with. George was annoying and he should've been tranquilized and thrown into the zoo. The only thing I liked about the movie was the use of computer animation to enhance the traditional cartooning."
5,"NIce, sweet, appropriate for younger kids","I thought the movie was a breath of fresh air in an era of overhyped computer-animated ""cartoons"" full of in-jokes and sarcasm. This was a real cartoon- gently animated, slowly paced, and written for kids. No snarky sarcasm, no annoying talking animals, no ridiculous violence, just a sweet tale told so that it could be enjoyed by all ages. There is nothing to scare a very young child, and children will not come away with rude comments that they learned from it. It is what movies for kids should have always been.The plot is slightly pointless, but the plot really isn't the point anyway. The real point is how cute George is, and how nice it is to watch him being curious. The songs are sweet and not too loud or jarring. All of mine, from ages 2 up to 7, liked the movie, and it kept their attention without making them anxious. I wish I could give it six stars."
1,Not the best for little ones.,"Our toddler is a Curious George (CG) fan. He was so excited to see George at the start of the movie but lost interest as the movie progressed (there are quite a few scenes where CG takes a backseat to TMWYH and his storyline). We finished the movie later and we were glad our son didn't watch the rest - the part where TMWYH gives CG to animal control is so sad! See the other reviews regarding upset children. I'm sure an older child could understand, but as for us, we won't be watching with our younger son. I only wish we had rented instead of purchased."
4,Stays true to the series,I was very pleased to see the movie kept the spirit of the comic books. It was very humorous. Even with the additions of modern touches like cell phones it still works. Loved it!
5,Great movie for little ones without any mean words!,I am so tired of movies geared at little kids that have words like shut up and stupid. This movie is not only entertaining but doesn't include any bathroom humor or inappropriate words. GREAT MOVIE!
5,my granddaughter loves George!,my granddaughter who is 18 months old prefers curious george over all the other cartoons on television. This is a great movie.
3,Good movie ruined by lethargic music,I really like this film but the soundtrack makes the movie painful to watch. You will be better off buying the cartoons if you want too enjoy George and feel good. Or you could watch the movie version and jump off a bridge.
5,DVD,My grand daughter loves George. Good price and good service. Will shop again and would recommend to anyone.
5,"Beautiful, innocent, gorgeous","Curious George is a heart-warming tale about a mischievous little monkey. I'd recommend it to anyone who has children ... even adults will find themselves drawn to the innocent fun of this story. The music is relaxing, soothing and lovely. A wonderful buy for the whole family!"
4,great little coffee maker,This is a great little coffee pot. My only complaint is that is does not do a great job keeping the coffee warm after it has been made.
1,Horrible purchase,I'm an avid coffee drinker and after doing much research I decided to up my budget and purchase a 'top' machine. Well if this is the top of the line coffee I'd hate to think of low end coffee. The coffee doesn't taste good no matter what type I have tried...in addition the coffee maker itself is really difficult to use and a mess to clean. Do yourself a favor there is a reason most makers are not making machines that brew this way. I wish common sense would have played into my purchasing decision.
2,Makes a great cup of coffee.......but,"Love the coffee. Hate the waiting time; at least 10 minutes once it gets up to temperature. What is the absolute worst: I broke the carafe. Treat your glass carafe like gold. The ONLY way that Krups will sell you a replacement carafe is with the entire 2 piece lid to the tune of $43. The manufacturer gives you some line about each carafe being specifically made for each lid. I don't believe it, and even if I did, I will not replace the carafe again if it breaks. Good coffee; not worth $100 + $43 + another $43 and so on. Rip off."
4,Only good coffe I've ever had from a home electric brewer,"I love this machine, For years I've used drip makers and never got good coffee. I tried all kinds of coffees, different grinds and bought an expensiive burr grinder but was never happy This machine give that mellow rich coffee that a French press delivers. It would be nice if it had a built in timer, but I solved that problem with an inexpensive electronic timer so that my coffee is waiting each morning. The only con is the warming plate is not quite hot enough, though the coffee is piping hot when first brewed.If not for the warming plate and lack of timer I'd give it 5 stars, the brewed coffee is great !"
2,"Well, it made a great cup of coffee for the first couple of weeks...","We were initially very pleased with this item. Its pressure steam system made an aromatic, rich cup of coffee--for the first couple of weeks until a crack developed in the plastic base, allowing the steam to escape. Then it made a real bitter cup of joe. We had to return the base to the authorized Krups repair shop several weeks ago and are still waiting for a replacement!"
5,Originally I was very impressed but..,"...I've gone back to using my little Delonghi four-cup brewer. This Moka Brew is too big a pain in the rear to use and if you find the replacement filters on-line, the shipping cost as much as the filters themselves. I see this unit if unavailable now anyway."
4,Like you are drinking coffee in Italy,This coffee pot makes a great first cup of coffee. Follow directions to dampen the filter first! It is awkward to pour water in to the reservoir...but it's worth the hassel. (there doesn't seem to be an auto turn-off...)
1,Beware - this item had been discontinued,"If you are thinking about buying this item, you should know that you can no longer obtain a replacement carafe (which is made out of a fairly thin glass) for this unit and according to Krups customer care nothing else will fit this model."
4,Yummy coffee,"I like super strong, fresh-brewed French roast coffee, and I have gotten superior coffee from this machine every time. I fill the grounds basket all the way to make about 4 cups of coffee at a time. The moka maker is easy to use, and you don't need a fancy grinder to get good results with it. There's definitely an art to grinding the beans and packing the filter basket, but even the worst pot of coffee from this machine has been good. It's true that the coffee ""dies"" quickly---the moka is especially good as soon as it is brewed.I bought this coffee maker several years ago. It broke after only a few uses, and getting it repaired under warranty took over a year! But my appreciation for this machine was renewed after a recent, bad experience with the Cuisinart Brew Central, which brewed bad coffee and was defective out of the box.This coffee maker deserves 5+ stars because of the delicious coffee it produces and 1 star for the lousy Krups warranty service."
5,Coffee Lovers Only,"What can I tell you; you will not make a better cup of coffee in this price range, maybe at all. But, you do have to put up with a couple of minor inconveniences. Timed start would be very nice. What would be nicer is if the filter basket were easier to empty. Because this machine steams the grinds, they are very dry; just enough moisture to bind them tightly together, causing the user to sometimes resort to digging them out with a knife. Not so bad really. Coffee is wonderful and the praise from my guests over the coffee and the looks of the machine pleases me abundantly. Enjoy!"
2,Disappointed,"A nice idea, but hard as h--- to use. Why can't someone design a decent coffee maker, especially one that doesn't make 86 cups at a time? I expected more of Krups, whom I have never forgiven for discontinuing their 4-cup model."
3,Not as good as a French press,"By the time you put in the filter, load the coffee, add the water, and when finished, clean up; it takes more work than a French press, for a lot more money. We thought it might keep the coffee warmer for a little while, but it doesn't.Makes a good cup though, better than drip, and no mud, but the flavor doesn't last. There is the smell of burnt coffee while brewing, but definitely no taste afterwards. We've gone back to using the French press and a thermos. Not any more work, and much better coffee. If you're looking for ease of operation and automation, there are better choices. We'll still use this when we have to brew a large amount for a party, etc."
4,maximum evanescence,"The two cds cover every ascept of the history, career and current releases of Evanescence. I thoughly rate this box set, and would buy it again if it was stolen or lost."
1,Poor Quality control,"This audio book is a nice version for Catholics. I have listened to it several times. The problem with this product is that the printed labels on the CD's do not match the content of the CD. So, if you are looking for a specific book and chapter, you see that item printed on the label, but when you go to the track listed on the label, it is a totally different book/chapter. I have been in contact with Oasis Audio for over 2 years on this issue, and the only response I keep getting is that it will be fixed in the ""next run"". Well, I even helped them find all the incorrect printed labels, they did another production run and they sent me a new copy. However, the new copy was wrong too. They refuse to fix the problem until all of the current production run have been purchased. SO......buyer beware."
4,New American Bible,"the "" New American Bible ""on Cd brings it alive & keeps you attention & very interesting. Different books are easily available for references."
3,DOWN THE TUBES?,"The Great Grand Daddy of techno punk rock have done it again. What seemed wild and progressive and outrageous 20 years ago comes across like pretty traditional rock now, but for old fans---and new ones---this is a great retrospective. Fee Waybill's lead vocals seem clearer and cleaner than previous recordings, which, for such a lyric-driven group, is a major plus. Roger Steen's driving lead guitar and Prairie Prince's pounding rock percussion have not been dimmed by the decades. Old favorites ""Mondo Bondage"" and ""White Punks on Dope"" remind us that techno need not be muddy or unintelligible; two new songs, ""Loveline"" and ""Digi-Doll,"" prove that The Tubes still have energy, wit, a level of creativity and a social consciousness not usually associated with such music. Tubes groove"
5,spectubular!!!!,the tubes are an (inter)national treasure. this album is awesome. the two new tracks are excellent. i saw them touring in support of this album at bbkings in new york city and it was tube heaven! i stayed for both shows and was left wanting more. nothing's better than sitting 10 feet away from one of your all time favorite bands! and this cd is an acurate recording of just how they sound live. i just wish this were a double cd with twice as many songs! but ill take what i can get. oh mighty tubes!
3,Pedestrian Live Set,"Hardcore fans like me will enjoy giving this a few spins, but it is inferior in every way to What Do You Want From Live. Still, there are some old gems that shine here. The track listing is sort of like a comprimise between 70s and 80s, fans of the 80s will be a whole lot happier though. The two new tracks are better than I expected. While it is annoying to break the ""live"" flow, the group is correct in assuming that this is the only way they could get me to buy any of their post-Sputnik material."
5,Yummy,"My ekkie &green cheek loves this bean mix. They eat it every day in addition to Rowdy bush crumbles, bananas, almonds, sprouts, etc. It just smells so good when its cooking in the rice cooker. One day I decided to taste it. It was pretty delicious! I would recommend thus product to all parronts."
3,Just an ordinary night out with a girl and a guy.,"It's Cara's 18th birthday and she has no friends, the pizza guy shows up and they go for a night of adventure.I was eager to see what ""adventures"" the two main characters would get into, but nothing that exciting ever happened. But, this makes the story more believable, and it shows how people would really act in the situations they get into. This movie may gain a cult following, but I don't think the characters were that memorable."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed!,Great character study with a lot of heart! Probably a little known movie but very well done! Left me with a smile. I highly recommend it if you don't require violence and gore in your movies.
5,ETHAN EMBRY HAVE MY BABIES????!,"Why do I love this movie? I dont know. Its awkward but so funny. after getting it in the mail I watched it 2 times then 2 more times with the directors voice over in two days. Ethan Embry Is supper fit. And The movie is enjoyable as a coming of a age story for a 18 year old dorky gal. Awesome cover of David Cope's ""lush life"" is featured in this movie. Good Condition of the box and shipping was fast."
2,Erotic? Questionable,"This ""3D"" CD is merely stereo. We should all be familiar with how different sounds can come from different speakers. This is not a music CD but a series of stories and performances often delivered without any real passion.The tracks vary greatly in subject and presentation but most lack any sense of the erotic. We begin with some silly music followed by a low quality answering machine message. The final track is about 60 seconds of buzzing (supposedly a vibrator).The sound effects are also disappointing. We are supposed to believe that the sound of scrambling eggs is actually someone gently putting lotion on someone else.The music is another flaw. Often jarring and discordant (like the clanging cow bell) the music will more likely derail a mood than it will enhance one.I am sure some people will like a track or two (I only really liked on track) but it is hardly something to be listened to straight through."
5,get this cd,"just put on the headphones and lock yourself somewhere dark. if this doesn't get you in the mood, nothing will."
3,Total package lacking,"The router unit is very nice, soft start is great, variable speed is good, motor is very smooth. Problems I had were; lack of a paper owners manual is inconvenient, also plunge unit was scratched and marked and had a missing knob which was also inconvenient."
2,Penny pinching Porter Cable,I've been looking for a dust extraction adaptor and just found one but I don't trust that it will fit. It is located in the US and apparently costs about a dollar and a half. The first search I had the same as your fellow countrymen was for the screws that shurely should come with the Router Kit that locate the guide rods. Not supplied with the Kit I was told but got 30 back from Amazon who said these were not available through them. I looked on the Amazon site & bought 100 of these very necessary screws in Stainless for 11. Because these items cause frustration and annoyance to the buyer why on earth don't Porter Cable get their act together and supply these measly items with the Kit or is it the fact they are just too damn mean ?
1,Not up to reputation,I was so disappointed when this arrived. I had saved up my $ and was treating myself to a new router. Of course I went for Porter Cable because of the reputation. I could not believe how cheap this router felt in my hands. Way too much play in the settings. I sent it back right away and bought the Milwaukee combo kit instead. What a difference between the two! The Milwaukee is solid and well engineered. Don't make my mistake. Porter Cable is not what it should be.
2,PORTER CABLE,"Well after all the years of hearing the wonders of PC, I decided maybe I needed to own one to go along with my other 6 routers. I had always shyed away before because of there high prices mainly. This router is a total POC for doing anything that requires any degree of precision. The run out in the collet was 0.058 with a 6"" drill rod installed. That is 0.010 at a typical 1"" bit height. Try to get those dovetails tight with that, next to impossible. I did find if you loosen the collet and rotate to just the right spot I could get the runout down to 0.015. AHA, the collet must be bad so I got another one and low and behold it was worse than the first. I'M done with PC forever. I'm going back to my makita routers which have 0.006 runout at 8"" height!!!"
1,What were they thinking?,"I own several routers (5) and this kit is very disappointing!What were the engineers thinking when they designed the placement and design of the On/Off switch? It is poorly positioned as compared to say, a Makita, where I can still hold onto the router handles with both hands and flip off the machine using one finger.The Plunge Base Vertical Adjustment is cheap and cumbersome!I own several other Porter Cable products and they are absolutely great! Biscuit Jointer, Belt Sander, Nail Guns, etc. I wish I could say the same for this router kit!After many years of satisfied use of Porter Cable products, both professionally and as a hobbiest, it pains me to write a poor review of a Porter Cable product."
1,Poor design,"I expected more when I shelled out the extra dollars for the 895pk. There is a lot of backlash in the fixed base. The above table height adjustment lock is very poor. It consists of a 3/16"" hex shaft going through a cast aluminum locking lever to operate it. The small shaft easily breaks the locking lever. When I get my new locking lever, I will not use the above table adjustments (a prime selling point as I use my 895pk in a router table 95% of the time). Also when in a table, the motor jams in the base and is very hard to unjam. When I bought my 895pk, the spindle lock actuator on one of the bases was missing. I called PC and they said they no longer use or support this feature, and no longer even sells it as a repair part. When I was ordering the replacement locking lever, guess what I found in the replacement parts listing, the spindle lock actuator. Someone was either misinformed or lied. I wish I had kept the Bosch 1617 I had before this and put up with its switch problem."
1,The blue smoke,"came out of the top within one hour's use. They call it a 2-1/4 HP router, but it doesn't have the guts of the classic PC 1-3/4. Between going to buy it, and driving back to return it, I spent more time on the road than the router lasted. I'll rate this a one, because I can't rate it negative 4."
5,Initial impression,"Right out of the box and with only several hours of playtime, I dare to document my initial impressions:- Incredibly solid and precise machined parts- Fit and finish are wonderful (as usual)- Quiet running (soft start is more enjoyable that I originally anticipated)- CD Rom included with manual, demos, and projects (lets see other companies drudge that extra mile)I will update my review as I log more time with the unit.Update:Subjected the router to multiple jobs and put it through an 8 hour router class at a local woodworking supply shop. The unit has yet to bog down in material. The instructor and the class as a whole were impressed with the unit. When compared to other routers from DeWalt, Bosch, and (older) Porter Cable, the 890 pulled ahead in bit change, adjustment, and power. I am glad I did my research as I could not be happier with this machine."
1,Sad product for a good name,"I have had the PC 893 Router for over a year. the plunge mechanism is awful, it slips, and its not reliable. The depth control in fixed base mode is awful, it binds, then releases, moving a lot more han what you want. The last straw is that the speed control has suddenly started to go from 16,500 RPM to like 5000 RPM in the middle of a cut, or it starts at 5000 RPM, and doesnt get to speed. Turn it off, and on, then it works, until it decides to slow down. Reliability isnt visible here. I am in the market for a new router, and it will NOT BE a PC brand."
1,poor construction from a good company,"The motor clamp handle has broken twice in one year on my 895 router. The part costs $1.00. There is to much play in the height adjustment. When you clamp the motor closed the motor moves way out of line, and is virtually worthless when making doors with cope and stile bits. The plunge base is extremely hard to plunge. Try another brand as Porter-Cable has failed miserably with this router."
2,Disapointed in product and support,"The locking mechanism and adjustment is disapointing in actual use. The one plus is that it is quiet. Unfortunately, it became too quiet.At 13 months (one month out of warranty) the variable speed control failed after only about 1 hour of total run time. The repair at the local service center was $104. After several contacts and complaints, PC is unwilling to make any concession. With PC, Delta and Dewalt all owned by the same company, is this what we have to expect from American companies? Next purchase, (won't be PC) I will look for a manufacturer with a longer warranty. I guess I will have to buy all Japanese tools!"
3,Beautiful but hard to install,"This Birdbath looks great and the birds seem to love it. Installation, however, is NOT easy. If you decide that you want to stand it up, the poles that it sits on are not nearly long enough for how far into the ground you need to stick it if you don't want it to fall over at the first gust of wind. If you decide to hang it, the brackets are very difficult to put take on and of when you must clean it (which should be done 3-4 times a week, as it get dirty very quickly and develop this white pasty coloredfilm at the botttom) Overall, It looks Great but installion is a pain in the butt."
4,Sunswept Royal Blue Birdbath,This birdbath was originally a gift and lasted a number of years until I left it out too late and it cracked in a hard freeze. Just replaced it and my birds and I are happy! I have it standing in the ground and it is a bit difficult to get level. Easy to clean as you can just bring it in to thoroughly scrub from time to time.
2,Expensive and not worth the money,Purchased this for my fine feathered friends and was very disappointed by the cheap flimsy stand. It does not hold the birdbath well and tilts very easy. The instructions are a POS. very small and you need a magnifying glass.
4,Great Value for the Price,"I am very pleased with the quality of this bird bath for the price. It's very attractive. I am using mine as a hanging feeder, and I do wish the chains were affixed permanently to the bowl. They come off every time I take it down to clean it. I also had to measure the circumference of the bowl and place three marks at equal intervals so it hangs evenly. But of course you only have to do that once.The birds don't seem to want to have anything to do with it (I've had it a few weeks) but we've had plenty of rain here so it hasn't been hard for them to find water elsewhere. I intend to keep trying!"
3,Sunswept bird bath,I would have liked a larger terra cota basin with a blue interior. Had to settle for this as it was all that I could find.
4,Very good product,"This is my third electric ashtray of this model that I purshase. This is a very good product that work as intended. It is not completely smokeless, but does a good job capturing most of the smoke. I would say that on average they last for about two years. After that, the noise from the electric motor becomes increasingly annoying. The only reason I dont give it five starts is because it only comes in this chome finish that gets all messed up with your fingerprints. I would prefer it is also available in at least one color, say black."
2,OK for the semi smoker!!!,"This is an ok product. It works great for the smoker who puts their cigarette down everytime they take a pull. I don't know about you but when I smoke I don't put my cig down until I am done. It catches the smoke only when you go to flick the ashes or if you leave it in there. I tried blowing the smoke at it to see if it caught it but it did not. The reason I give 2 stars is one it can be plugged in and two for the rare times I do put my cig in it, it does catch the smoke. I am sure a semi smoker who does put the cig down every pull would give this product 4 to 5 stars."
3,It's ok,"Unless you go outside to smoke, there's always going to be the smell of smoke in your house, even with this.BUT, it's better than nothing. Since I'm a smoker, I can't smell smoke, so I can't tell you whether or not I'm fooling anyone.I agree with the other reviewer, it would be so much better if they had an on/off switch.It's easy to figure out, there's nothing high tech about it and it's a fairly simple design."
3,Holmes Smoke Grabber HAP76,"works as advertised. filters hold up pretty well to 1 smoker, although she smokes ALOT! A little noisy, but not unbearable, more of a loud humming.it really did cut down on the ambient smoke left after my wife smoked a cigarette."
5,This was good. Lewis and Harris do it again,"Is there anything that those two guys can put their minds to and not make successful?This was a compilation CD and it was good. It has songs that are good to run to, or songs that are good to sit back and listen to with some cold tea. It's not as cerebral as some jazz albums, but it is a fun listen just the same.At the very least, this was as much a showcase of Harris and Lewis' talents as it was of Alexander O'Neal. It is one of those CDs that you listen to frequently."
3,Loved Eliza; Hunter was a disappointment...,"What a wonderful story! But I would have enjoyed it so much more if I was able to fall for Hunter the way Eliza did. I found myself unable to sympathize with an alcoholic. He was lacking in warmth and charisma. Eliza, along with Hunter's children, Blue and Belinda, were strong, enchanting characters who made the story an enjoyable read."
1,RESEARCH if you're going to write historical novels,"p. 11"" . . .the room contained only the most necessary of firearms--a le Mats revolver, a percussion shotgun and a Winchester repeating rifle.""The first rifle to bear the Winchester name was the ""Yellow Boy"" (because of the brass frame) the ""1866 Model"". Unfortunately this particular scene is supposed to take place in 1854. A 12 year goof.Jean Alexander LeMat obtained a patent for an open-frame single-action revolver 1n 1856.Food, clothing, slang, etc. are all part of the background of an Historical novel. It's difficult, if not impossible, to get it 100%, but this is just bad! How much time would it take to google on period firearms?"
4,Worth reading.....,""" The Horsemasters Daughter"" was a good book, however it took a long while for the story to grab hold of me...it sort of felt like it was split into 2 separate stories...first at the island and then later at Albion. I liked Eliza well enough, but I had a hard time connecting with Hunter. Honestly my favorite character was Hunters 9 year old son, Blue. This was a worthwhile read, and though I would have liked to have seen more of them, it was a pleasure to revisit with Ryan and Isadora from ""The Charm School"" I cant say that this book made it to my keepers list, but I have to admit that this story had an extremely satisfying ending that left me smiling."
5,The sweetness of hope and healing....,"There are so many scenes in this book that are burned forever in my memory...the first time the horse responds to Eliza...Ryan from The Charm School walking up on the beach (you get to catch up with him and Isadora, who I loved)...the first love scene (be still my heart!)...the jumping-on-the-bed scene, the breakfast with the kids scene...and every single scene about ""Blue,"" the little boy who needs love so much, and finally gets it. This is everything I want in a book--laughter, tears, cheers, and a surprise twist in the end that amazed me!"
1,Where's AA when you need them?,"Warning: Necessary SpoilersI enjoyed Eliza a lot, but Hunter irritated me from the first. He's a mean and abusive drunk, a thugish rapist (in his own mind at least -- Eliza is more forgiving, but then she's never been in co-dependence therapy), and a thick clod throughout most of the book, treating Eliza with open contempt, passing her off as his servant so as not to embarrass himself in front of *her* ""betters,"" yada, yada, yada. In short, he's everything in a man your mother ever warned you about, but worse, because he lives in an age in which there are no effective police or protective orders available.This was the first of Susan Wiggs usually excellent books I've ever encountered in which I appreciated the sentiments of Dorothy Parker in her review of Benito Mussolini's The Cardinal's Mistress, ""This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force."""
4,Another Great Book!,"After reading Susan Wiggs' ""The Charm School"", my expectations were high since I had LOVED that book. ""The Horseman's Daughter"" was also an interesting book that held my attention and did not disappoint me at all. What a fascinating main character who had lived her life in her own private world. I found it a little hard to believe she went back ""into civilization"" as easy as she did, though....after being such an isolated person for so long. But besides that, I loved the interactions of the character and especially the way she reached into the ""silent word"" of Blue. A book worth reading!!!!"
5,The Horsemasters Daughter,Completely happy with the condition of this paperback and as always love Susan Wiggs stories. Can't wait to read the next volume in this series.
3,Good but not great!,You know the story has been told time and time again...but I did enjoy the read. Nothing new or exciting but very well rounded characters and an over all decent read!
5,Fabulous!,"I truely loved reading this book.This is the sequel to The Charm School and I found it better than it's prequel. I was swept away by the romance, the challenges of taming a mad horse, and the frustration of dealing with a child who was so depressed by his mother's death that he refuses to speak. I couldn't put the book down! I finished it in record time. This is one of the best works by Susan Wiggs. Nothing I've read after this could even compare."
5,Pool and Spa Comparators,I work for the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort and Spa in New mexico and we have several pools and whirlpools. We have used many different types of comparators and this one is by far our favorite one. Easy to read and eay to use.
4,"Duffy, An Autobiography","Heard about this book recently after many years. Decided to purchase as Duffy was coach during my time at MSU. He had many insights on the school administration and political climate, along with the Big Ten Neanderthal attitude toward school sports.I was affected some, being in the Spartan Marching Band and missing opportunities that now are expected nowadays. He was a man of vision and character from a hard scrabble Pennsylvania background."
4,Good Christmas CD,We really just bought this CD for the Christmas Cookie song but the rest is good too!
5,this is a wonderful collection of pop-rock songs,"from beginning to end, Devin Hill, called by many fellow musicians the most underrated singer-songwriter of today, delivers warm and cool guitar driven pop. buy this album."
1,Magix is Junk,"While feature rich (16 tracks, etc), it just doesn't work as advertised. Stay away from this one! The software fails to pick up scene changes, first of all, making it a very labor intensive operation to do scene cuts. Next, the timeline editing is very difficult to work with when one wants to cut sections of a video. Finally, after working all day on a video, it failed to recognize my CD burner, which has not had a problem yet in any other application. This is a relatively new Dell P4 with 1GB of memory, etc. I got a DLL error and when I went to the Magix site to download a patch, it still failed to write.I want my money back, but more importantly, I want my TIME back. What a waste. Now I have to call tech support, but they are only open on East Coast hours. Very convenient for them, but not so for me.Lesson learned is stick with a branded company, such as Adobe. Your time is worth something!"
1,Magix is smoke and mirrors!,"One call to Magix technical support will make you realize that these guys are sharks. It's obvious that there's one guy for each division of support and the one I talked to for video talked and behaved more like a drug dealer than a software professional. I called and e-mailed him for weeks and all he did was make up reasons for why it was my and everyone else's fault and not the software or his obvious incompetence. He insisted there were several solutions but volunteered none over the phone whenever I spoke with him. He said he would e-mail me information many times and when it never arrived, blamed my e-mail. One last time I tried to get him to provide some solution over the phone and he only became increasingly belligerent as I politely pleaded with him to help me. The software looks pretty, but what's inside is ugly."
2,"Great Music, Old CD Repackaged","I just got this CD. The music is great, typical Barry White. What customers should know is that this is not a new album released in 2004 as the product description indicates. It's a repackaged album from 1994. Here's a link to the original album:Barry White & the Love Unlimited Orchestra - Back to Back: Their Greatest HitsWhat Universal Music Enterprises did was take this original album and slip it into a cardboard sleeve with updated info and picture. Take the CD out of the outer sleeve and it's the exact same as in the link I provided above. So, save $9 and order the album for $6.99."
4,"30 Days of Night in a ""B"" film","I primarily bought the video being a fan and user of Russian Konvas and Kinor cameras which were used to shoot this film. The look is excellent and the special effects are reminiscent of Harryhausen, which gives a fresh breath to the overly slick effects used today. Cinematographer/DP Anders Banke did a splendid job even if the story is kind of silly. It's like a new style Grindhouse film. Subtitles are used but the story is easy to follow and entertaining with a few good laughs."
4,Great movie,"Very well done, and also funny movie. If you don't mind subtitles this movie is worth getting."
2,It just bites!,"This Swedish horror comedy about vampires that take over a town during what known as polar night. It is when the sun will remain down for up to 24 hours. This will of course mean the vampires have more timme to roam about town. A pill manufactured by a vampire scientist that supposed to turn humans into vampires makes it way to a local party. Thinking it's some kind of new drug the teens pass it around without a second thought. It does'nt take long before evryone begins to turn on each other. This movie gets is ridiculous at times. For one, the dogs talk in this movie. Yes they talk. They have no real purpose but to try and be funny nothing else. To make things worse the action does not pick up until the last 25 minutes or so in this film. Until then we only see shadows of killings. Overall Sweden failed attempt at a fun horror-comedy for the vampire genre. It has a bad script,editing, and video-game effects. I just can not recommend this one."
1,Not for me,"I am sending this back it was just not for me, the smell is a little to me like the old jean nate....yes! I said it to me it smelled loud, old and bad...I like soft subtle fragrances. When I opened the box my daughter said I can smell that from here, and she was sitting on the couch, it does not smell like what you would use."
2,Not a fragrance I like,It just isn't what I like to smell or smell like and no one in my family likes it either. I won't buy it again.
1,Fake or Bad Item,"I received a box of Inner Realm. It smelled terrible, just terrible. It most certainly WAS NOT what it was reported to be.I've read numerous product reviews on Amazon with claims that the perfumes were fake. I always dismissed these, assuming that people did not know what they were talking about. However, I can assure you that Amazon is selling either fake perfumes or bad perfumes, and this is not the first time that I received a bad item from Amazon. Clearly, something is wrong with the suppliers that they use.My strong advice is to refuse to accept any open box item or any item that does not smell as it should from Amazon. If necessary, order a $1-$3 sample from one of the perfume vendors to compare. For me, moving forward any beauty item that I receive is under the microscope."
5,Worth every penny and then some!,"Although the fragrance blend is very light, it has a subtle, feminine scent that really lingers. Pheromones or not, men really respond and comment positively on the Inner Realm scent for hours after application. Consequently, a little goes a long way, so this also makes this cologne a great bargain! The compliments make me forget (for a moment) that I'm not a 20-something anymore!!"
5,LOVE THIS STUFF,"I have looked and looked for this product since Erox sold out......I only have one small complaint (pun intended) I always purchased the larger size and cannot find that available.......perhaps soon, I hope...the scent itself did become available again....so I will crosseverything crossable and keep trying. Everyone mentions my perfume and wants it...ladies for themselves and the men for their girlfriends/wives. Says a lot for this scent! ME????I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!"
3,Incorrect product sent,Incorrect product sent and quality of product didn't meet our expectation. Shipped on time but disappointed to see a different product.
5,Pvt. Murphy's Law,"Mark Baker truly captures the essence of military life in his comic book, Pvt. Murphy's Law. The book is a great read whether you're in the military or not. It also makes a wonderful souvenir for people who've served in the army or their friends and family.I can really relate to Murphy's mishaps because I'm in the army myself. After 15 years of service, it's refreshing to see so many different army quirks captured this well in art.It's great following Pvt. Murphy through his transformation from a civilian into an airborne soldier. I read the book from cover to cover in one sitting when I first bought the book. Since then, I've reread it several times and still catch myself laughing out loud!"
5,A Humorous Look At The Military,"Pvt. Murphy's Law is an outstanding glimpse at the lighter side of military life. As a member of the military for over 16 years I can appreciate the situations that Pvt. Murphy finds himself in. It's obvious that the author has found himself in many of these situations and has chosen to see the humor in many aspects of military life (especially the Letter to the Editor that a Lt. Col. wrote in response to a Pvt. Murphy cartoon.) Mr. Baker's art work is great and the cartoons themselves are extremely funny, but not disrepectful to the military. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an enjoyable read and a brief look at how funny and fun the military can actually be. I give Mr. Baker and his book five star's and hope that he continues putting Pvt. Murphy in these comical situations."
2,I hope this isn't their best,"I picked this album up after hearing about this band from a friend. He described it as a viking themed death metal band. Well, that's the last time I listen to his recommendations. This is an average at best death metal release. ""The One Insane"" and ""Execute Them All"" are fun songs, but the album as a whole isn't worth your money. It's not really brutal or interesting in any way, and the vocals are some of the worst death vocals out there. The band's cover of ""Breaking the Law"" is a joke at best. I gave it two stars because it's at least tolerable to listen to. Hopefully thier other albums are better then this one."
3,Fun for a while,"I like the concept behind this toy. It teaches about gravity and momentum. My boys (6, 3) like using this from time to time, but it does not engage them for more than 5 minutes at a time. I wish it held their attention for longer."
4,Frigits,Great concept and design. The kids love it. And they've come up with some pretty cool designs. Neat toy...until all of the little marbles end up under the fridge.
5,Doesn't stick to stainless steel refrigerator!,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew not realizing - DUH - it won't stick to a stainless steel refrigerator! So as long as you can find an alternative location for this toy, it's pretty fun. We played with it on the dishwasher a few times but it was a little too short. Really would work best on a fridge :("
4,Every visitor loves it!,"A family friend gave us these Frigits for our son, who was about five at the time. It's sort of thing that every guy loves -- setting up chutes and jumps and back-and-forth tracks. I like to go for the maximum possible air, myself.Every friend of our son who comes into the kitchen plays with it, and most adults -- guys, anyhow.Inevidably the marbles fall into the dog dish or roll away, and pieces get knocked off the refrigerator door, but none have been broken.I don't know how much genuine learning goes on with it, but it is a lot of fun to have."
5,Hours of fun!,Fun for my kids! Creative use of play time! My seven and eleven year old enjoy it! Only negative is marbles roll under your fridge!
5,4 year old loves it.,My son and I love this toy. It is so different than what is out there. He has a ball with it. He loves it when the ball bounces on our tile floor. He may like that better sometimes. I think it is a great toy for anyone.
2,Mullica River History....People Not Places,"I own the unofficial Mullica River Website. I purchased this book in hopes of finding answers to the most common questions thay may arise when you visit the Mullica - i.e. What is the history with the abandoned house at the end of the river? or Who designed the Cuts? I didn't find these answers, rendering the book almost useless to me. It was full of chatter about people that really had very little to do with the Mullica River at all! There were a few useful sections about the British running the river ages ago, but still found the book to be difficult reading. The book was copyrighted originally in 1945, so don't plan on seeing recent history in the book (or propper grammer for that matter). It was REVISED (one page to be exact) in 1963.Worth the money? Not for me. It now sits on a bookshelf collecting dust. Perhaps at my tag sale next year.Rob Blanda"
4,A Complete Introduction to an Important Band,"I bought this CD to get an introduction to the music of the Pogues. I play Irish music, and often get requests from people for something they heard from the Pogues. This collection has two disks, one studio, and one live, so it gives you a good feel for both aspects of the band. It is immediately apparent why so many folks remember their music and performances fondly. Their music is brash, powerful, energetic and loud. They did a lot of new material, and approached older tunes with enthusiasm and conviction, an approach that brings new life to those old chestnuts. You can hear the fact that Shane MacGowan was a heavy drinker in the live performance, but while slurred, his singing is still strong and powerful. While the music is more rock-oriented than I normally listen to, I am glad I bought the CD--I can see why this band is considered pivotal in the recent history of Irish music."
5,"Give Best of as a Gift, Keep Live CD for Yerself","Can't really say what hasn't been said previously and say it better, so in short, yeah, the best of is pretty much a toss off if you have all of the albums or one of the many best ofs available in import and domestic formats. The real treat here is the live reunion disc, squashing the inferior, band-disowned _Streams of Whiskey_ like the corn that went into many a bottle of Jameson's that's gone down MacGowan's throat. And when Shane goes off for a break (read: drink), you get Spider Stacy's beautiful post-Shane ""Tuesday Morning."" Buy it and listen to it 'til we see El Maria once again.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,Darger legacy treated shamefully.,"This version of the story of Darger omits or skims over some crucial details, eg; his fascination with whirlwinds, his conviction that he had been transported by one as a child. The unnecessary animations of the paintings is cheap and annoying as are the silly deep voices. His landlords were money grubbing exploiters of his legacy, selling 1/3, keeping a 1/3 and giving only a third to the American Folk art museum. This is an unforgivable travesty and is not dealt with in the film. Most self serving and disappointing, handy however for explaining Darger to the uninitiated. Best illegally downloaded. Save your money."
3,"Darger Inspires, Film-Maker Not So Much","Henry Darger is very inspirational. To characterize his art, as some have, as an offshoot of mental illness is insulting to Darger's legacy. Because he was different, solitary, does not make him mentally ill - he seemed to function as a person, hold a job, etc - why does this make him insane? Choosing solitude should not be considered an illness.The director took too much liberty in the choice to animate his drawings, and did it badly, to add insult to injury. Underemphasis on the Catholicism is also a problem. I hate to bring it up, but perhaps being Asian might be a slight barrier to fully understanding the Catholic aspect.The little girl voice is especially irritating, as it sounds like she needs to blow her nose really badly throughout all her narrations. I kept wanting to shout ""Hey, somebody get the litte girl a kleenex!"""
3,"Henry Darger, Life found","His work is amazing. What a prolific artist. If only I could be so productive with my work. Henry Darger lived in his world though. He was creating an alternative world in which he could control what happens. It sometimes felt like therapy, company or maddness. His genious is evident in his story telling and artwork. You never know who may be living next door to you. He may not have been much to notice in life but his work will hopefully live on forever."
1,The Realms of the Uninteresting,"Here's a fantastic idea: Let's make a documentary about someone about whom there is virtually NO information, just bits and pieces culled from the memories of strangers who came into contact with him once or twice some 30-odd years ago, who accomplished absolutely nothing save for writing and illustrating a voluminous fantasy novel that no one will ever read.I guess his art is okay, I just don't really think there is ANYTHING about a reclusive old janitor who wrote a book that is remotely interesting, and in my opinion, the filmmakers did nothing to convince me otherwise."
5,OUTSTANDING AND FASCINATING,"An amazing film! An amazing documentary! Don't pass this one up!The true, and mysterious story of a man who created a whole universe in his room.It just goes to show that sometimes, you can never what is going on inside someone's head. That art can come from anyone, and that sometimes you need art to surviveThis is a must see!"
5,A work of art in itself,"A most imaginative film. If you're expecting a traditional documentary on Henry Darger, this is not it. The filmmakers take an approach that is as daring and resourceful as their subject in animating Darger's work and avoiding art experts. The result is a haunting and emotional experience that speaks to the larger questions of art and life, and what it comprises a meaningful life. Highest recommendation."
5,So strange.,Such a strange and wonderous story. I don't know why I found it so interesting but I've watched the documentary numerous times. If yer odd like me you'll like it.
3,Not That Great...,This book is OK but not that great. It's unrealistic and doesn't include that much teenage issues besides what they are going to be and do when they grow up. But it is pretty cool to have a fairy godmother who shows you your future and guide your way throuh life :)
5,SK quality,"I have mostly SK and Craftsman tools.. You cannot beat the quailty as opposed to some of the other brands. I really like Snap On, Mac and Matco tools but have very little of them due to the price. SK in my opinion is of equal quality to Craftsman and made in the USA!"
3,"Good, but disappointed","This book is about the size of your palm. I thought it was larger, but it's stocking-stuffer size at best. The quotes and short poems inside are good, but the book was not what I expected. I had seen a woman at an airport reading a full sized book with the same title and author, and by searching with the author and title on Amazon, I expected to get the book I saw this woman reading. So, I was diappointed when the mini-version arrived."
5,I bought this book in September 1983 in Hong Kong,"I believe the book had managed to change my ""normal eyes"" to the ""photographer's eyes"".I must say my past 20 years of amateur photography life was mostly contributed from the knowledge I gained from this book.A paperback with 240+ pages with beautiful black and white photos for samples and illustrations.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to turn himself from a photography dummy to a professional within a week.C.N.T. LawHong Kong Decemebr 2002"
2,Competent but poorly laid out,"Mr. Edson knows the product. The execution of the instructions, however, is so confusing that I would not recommend this book for experienced programmers who are new to Visio programming."
3,Where is the Visio 2000 evaluation copy?,If you don't already own Visio 2000 you had better get it before buying this book because the only Visio on the CD is a version 5 evaluation copy. I have just hit the example wall where my version 5 can no longer open the examples written in Visio 2000. ... I do have to say that I am getting more out of this book about the shapesheet than any other book I've purchased. I'ts just real irritating about the 2000 problem.
2,Graham Wideman's book is much better,"I have read both of the books (and others) and I find that Graham Wideman's book Visio 2003 Developer's Survival Pack is far better than Edson's. Wideman also has the same book for Visio 2000 and 2002. Wideman's book has far fewer errors (and his corrections are online), and far more useful samples/examples. Just a lot more meat, frankly. Amazon may not have Wideman's latest book - google it or go to diagramantics.com. It's worth the cost for real visio developers."
3,"Good Information, Poorly Presented","Having now read most of this book, I can say that I learned far more than I got from the Microsoft PDF files that shipped with Visio Pro--but I can't say I enjoyed it. If a writer with an ego bothers you, find a different author. If errors bother you, find a different publisher. As if to make a page quota, whole paragraphs are repeated, changing only a letter: ""PosX is the X coordinate...{6-line paragraph)"" followed by ""PosY is the Y coordinate...(SAME 6-line paragraph)"". This cut and paste goes on for pages in places. Examples and exercises almost never yield a useful product, though they are carefully explained. David knows a lot of history of the tool, which would have been pretty interesting except for the thread of vanity that sewed the stories together."
3,A useful book 4 Visio developers,"When I started to read the book, at first I was overwhelmed by all the information. I found that it was hard getting through some explanations especially when finding that there are many typos in this book. The books that I read before on advanced usage of ConceptDraw were clearer but much easier concerning the programming part. This book is 100% for advanced Visio users."
3,Not my favorite Haanel book,"I've read several of Charles Haanel's books over the years and this was certainly not one of my favorites. Much of it is based on Haanel's great ideas about controlling your thoughts and developing your future but there is a great amount of space dedicated to the actual body chemistry which really doesn't seem to connect with his overall thesis about success. Yes, I understand the book is called ""Mental Chemistry"" but who would have guessed he was talking about body chemistry? You will be much better served reading any number of his other books for they will truly teach you how to change your thoughts and get the results you desire. In summary, nothing new in this book and it just simply doesn't make it worthwhile to spend your time reading."
3,cool,So far It brighten my face. I'm on my second pack. I guess to see the whole thing I have to wait... Anyway we need more better products on this section. For now if this our best what can we do? Just give it a shot...
1,Didn't Work for me. I took it From September to November,"This product didn't work for me. I took it for two months, I'm sure I would've saw some progress by now. It actually started to make me darker. I took vitamin C to increase the effects as well. Still nothing"
1,Doesn't work,I used the oralight pills for almost 2 months. Which was a waste of money they don't work. I didn't see any changes in my skin.
3,So far so good,I havn't been using this product for long I'm still on the first box and they say it takes about 3 box to notice some changes I'm hanging in there but I have notice my energy is diffrent since I started taking them. Idk but I will keep u posted
3,Glowing skin and about 5% lighter,"I have been taking this product for a month in hopes of getting back to my original skin color. I moved to California and have gotten almost 3 to 4 shades darker than I usually am. I try to stay out of the sun as much as possible, and wear a sun visor at all times outside. I use lightening soap and body products but I am still the same color. I was hoping oralight would lighten my skin, but it did not. It has definitely made my skin less dull looking, my face has a natural glow now. Because of the glow my skin looks a little lighter, but over all I am the same color. I took photos of myself every week to compare. If you want healthier looking skin I would use this but I would not get your hopes up too high for lightening your skin."
1,gave it two months but i dont think it works for black people,"I waited for two months before giving my review because i noticed most reviewers didn't give any follow up reviews.I am black with a light brown complexion so i didn't expect the results to take too long to show as i am not really considered dark for my race. I take two tablets a day religiously for the past two months at first i didn't see any results but i now appear to have gotten two shades darker. Now am stuck with 6 months worth of tablets which appear to be doing nothing if not making me darker, i didn't even get the proverbial glow.For the price i expected so much more. I hope they seller wont keep sending me annoying emails to withdraw this review as it seems impression management is their main concern.The product isn't worth the investment."
2,WAY Overpriced,"Research is a good thing.I was interested in lightening my skin and decided to read up on various supplements that are supposed to lighten the skin. The key ingredient in this product that does whiten the skin is bearberry aka uva ursi and you can buy it at a much more reasonable price than in products like this. Uva ursi/bearberry is also good for the urinary tract though I dont know if that is related to the whitening effect. L-Glutathione, L-Cysteine & C, 750 mg, 100 caps(a tripeptide) also whitens the skin and is better priced.Instead of coughing up too much $$ unnecessarily to whiten the skin, trySolaray - Uva Ursi, 500 mg, 100 capsulesinstead ofMakari Oralightand L-Glutathione, L-Cysteine & C, 750 mg, 100 caps instead ofIvory Caps - Maximum Potency Glutathione 1500 ""Skin Whitening"" Complex **SALE REG. $49.99 - NOW $29.99 - FREE SHIPPING"
4,it works,"I was looking for a product that actually works and found this here at Amazon. I read the reviews and purchased it. For the first two weeks, my face brightened and I havent had any pimples during my period. I am about to finish my first box and I will wait patiently 'til I'm 3 shades lighter on my legs and arms."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"I purchase the ORALIGHT and it doesn't work for me, I dark skin asain and your product hasn't change my skin, My skin is the same and it's been over a month of using this product. I would never purchase this or any product from your company. You should take this product off the market."
5,New to this product,"I heard about the Oralight pills on a very popular Skin Care Forum. And since my body and face are totally different shades ,I decided to give it a try. I am always interested in treating skin problems from the inside out. I haven't opened them yet but I plan to very soon. I have heard from other people on the skin care forum that they do work, but they just take time (about 3-6 months). Anyway I hope they work on me without any problem. I got my order very quickly and safely. If you want to order oralight pills, it would be a good idea to order from this seller. I'm satisfied with my order, thanks!"
3,from tan to yellow,i went from being tan (brown complexion)..to having yellow skin..(sort of like that)..but at least it made a difference..and made my skin smoother than before..
5,Shipping was super fast!,The shipping was super fast! It says to take this capsule 2 times a day! I'll update after 3 weeks now!
2,Oralight - High Way Robbery!,I've kept an eye on this product and the comments & must say that it's hard to believe that in the span of less than a month these supplements went from $36 to $57 dollars. Folks move on & use another resource to order these pills if you deem it necessary to spend this much money. This particular buyer isn't the only vendor...they see you coming!
2,I'm still waiting for the magic to happen!,I've been taking these pills over a month & i still haven't notice a difference. I'm going to purchase a second box & try taking 2 daily & see if i can achieve any sort of lightening -_-
1,Waste of MONEY :(,This product did NOT work!!! 1 month and nothing happened. Im so sad and disappointed with this product. I wasted my money on this product. :'(
5,Awesome!,"I received this product on December 3, 2009. I have been using it per the directions. I have seen a dramatic improvement in my skin tone/color. I AM SO WHITE! Even more so when I use it with glutathione and vitamin C. The key is consistency. My skin is so clear and radiant people actually come up to me and ask me if I'm pregnant and that's when I knew that this stuff is really awesome! I can only say that this product really works for me. I will be ordering this product again...soon."
3,Results are slight but temporary,"I have used two boxes. I started to see results in about three weeks. I began to get this radiant glow which was nice. But there was no improvement in the discoloration and dark marks. Its as if it improved the skin that was already clear and did nothing for the problem areas. I have dark acne marks and blemishes that will not go away despite my constant use of several different products. My goal is to even my skin tone more than it is to just lighten. I used other products, not makari, while taking the oralight pills but dark spots remain. Not even the high priced products I got from a dermatologist helped. I'm tired of wasting money. I am contemplating ordering a third box of the oralight since the slight results I got in the beginning have diminished."
4,Giving it a chance to work......,"This product shipped so fast...in literally 3-4 days. It has only been a month, so I'm not sure if it is making a difference,but I'm still going to stick with it for another two months or so.I think a major issue with taking any new supplement is to make sure your health is in its optimum state. Any bad habits like poor diet or drinking excessively will probably cancel out the benefits of this product. I am guilty of both!Maybe I will see more improvement in the Fall/Winter months. These hot Chicago days are a beast, so perhaps the sun is interfering with my progress. Still hoping for the best!"
2,not terribly impressed,"My 3 year old got this toy as a gift. He plays with it and seems to enjoy it but overall I am not impressed with this toy...- The forklift angles down slightly meaning that things tend to slide off it really easily, especially when moving the vehicle around.- The little man does not fit into the vehicle very well. My son gets very frustrated trying to get him in (the space is a little small for such a long person and requires more dexterity than most 3 year olds would have) and then once he is in he doesn't stay put.- The durability is generally ok (the vehicle has stood up to some tosses when my son got frustrated (see above)) but the workmanship was not what I would have expected from plan toys (or from the price). On the first day the little man's foot came unglued as well as another small (and seemingly insignificant) part on the forklift."
2,Touch to raise/lower...and it broke,The fork lift knob was tough to turn for raising and lowering...perhaps even impossible for the younger ones. And one of the wood nobbies that attaches one body piece to the other broke off the same day we opened it. We have since returned this and are looking for a different forklift toy.
2,arrived broken,Product arrived broken. You don't take a toy from a 3 year old to return it as soon as he opens it. He'll love the toy when it's been repaired but it's been a disappointing day. Fortunately it can be repaired at home and will be stronger than designed. I would have expected more from Plan Toys.
1,Piece of Junk,The scale was off by almost two degrees. I contacted Starrett and thoroughly discussed the problem with them. I sent the Protractor to them and they sent another one to me which was not correct either. I called Starrett again but couldn't get a guarantee that if I sent the second Protractor to them that I would receive one which was correct. The scales are a self sticking plastic that cannot be correct if they are off center when put on. This is another nice idea that hasn't been thoroughly thought out for production.
1,Starrett 505A-12 ProSite 12 Inch Dial Protractor,"After receiving 2 of these items, both with the same problem, I opted for the new 7 inch version. The problem with both units of the 505A-12 was that they were not even close to being true with their own calibration marks. I believe that 2 degrees or more are definitely out of spec for any measuring device, especially one that carries the Starrett brand name. I almost think that this type of accuracy would even be out of line for items coming from Harbor Freight! Amszon would not send out a third, so I had no choice but to go with the 7 inch version - which did not have any of the calibration issues of the 12 inch version. I'm glad I was not needing one of these for an immediate job..."
2,Pitifully inaccurate protractor scale,"As a stamped aluminum bevel without lock this thing is adequate. As a protractor it's an embarrassment to the Starrett name. The scale if off by a full degree at various angles, apparently because the thick plastic decal is not die cut concentrically with its printing. That's very poor quality for any measuring tool, and completely unexpected in a Starrett product."
5,ProSite Protractor,This product not only works well it has saved me a lot of time on installing crown moldings. I highly recommend it to anyone who does a lot of this type of work.
3,hard to read,"This Item should come with a magnifing glass. This gauge is microscopic. Also, it is hard to use in trimming those common short wall outside corners becuse of the length of it. One side should be able to slide like a common bevel square. Obviosly, the engineer never used it to trim a house."
3,not so accurate,I need absolute accuracy in my metalwork. I have found Starrett to be wanting on the last two tools I have purchased. My digital tape measure is off by 1/16 and this nifty protractor is about 1/2 degree off. I believe both are a direct result of outsourcing jobs. Neither of these tools appear to have been made in Mass.
1,Scale is way off,"If you are looking for accuracy, look elsewhere. This scale is off by 1-2 which is unacceptable for anything but rough framing perhaps."
5,"Fast, accurate solution to a time-consuming endeavor.","This tool is one of those devices that comes along and forever changes and simplifies a task. In this case, it's calculating the exact degree of a miter joint, be it a perfect 45 degree miter for a corner that's exactly square (rare) or an out of square head-scratcher. This baby takes you to the correct angle in quick time, and it's accurate too. It allows me to work instead of calculate, and it reduces mistakes and wasted mouldings. I love it, and I don't give tools a good review unless they deserve it.-Kevin F. CritesGeneral Contractor & journeyman finish carpenterLos Angeles, CA"
5,excellent product,I use this when putting up molding and I get a great fit every time. The only issue I have is that I wish they made a six inch for those small miters. I got around this by using a angle tool and matched it to the protractor once I got it set.
3,"Great for rough work, but not for finish.","As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the scales are decals that may or may not be accurate. The unit that I recieved is about 1 degree off which is managable.The bigger problem is that the scale (non miter) is laid out in 2 degree increments. This makes accurate readings difficult at best.For rough framing this tool is fine. For trim work I would recommend the Grizzly G9900 protractor. For the same price you get a tool that is very accurate with resolution down to 5 minutes (.08 degree). It is not as robust, but that is the trade off for the increased accuracy."
1,Starrett Quality Takes a Nosedive with this Product,"50 years ago, my father, a watchmaker, told me that anything you own made by Starrett will be the best you can buy. I have a number of their products and have always agreed with Dad's assessment. Starrett lost it with this protractor. The accuracy is just not there. If you are doing rough carpentry work and need approximations, go for it, but if you are planning to use this protractor to set up anything in a quality home workshop, you better keep looking.Disappointed!!"
5,Great protractor at a great price!,"I read many of the product reviews for this protractor before I purchased one. This is a great protractor! If you have a need to cut any angle, then you need this handy tool. I have been teaching Agriculture Education for over 20 years ,and instruct kids in a woodworking and welding shop setting. I wish I had purchased one years earlier. This would make a great addition to any professional or hobby woodworker."
2,Scale Is Off,"I agree with the other reviewers. I purchased this tool because of the Starett name and was deeply disappointed. The scale was definitely off. When you completely fold up the tool it is blatantly obvious. I e-mailed Starett and they said to return it to them for a replacement. I was not too confident that the new one would be any better. Starrett also stated they were changing the name of the tool to remove the word ""protractor"" because they had received so many complaints. In my case, I simply printed a ""red"" arrow on some sticky label paper and then cut it out and overlayed the decal on the tool. It's not pretty but the scale now reads accurately. I would not recommend buying this until this defect is corrected."
2,Protractor,"The protractor is good for some things. The scale is way too small for much of any type work! I had intended or hoped it would be readable in 1/10ths of a degree. Sadly, this is not the case, the graphic showing this item was not large enough to verify the above mentioned. I will be looking at a digital protractor next."
2,Not Good Enough for Woodworking,"Starrett's legendary name speaks for itself and the design is rugged and novel, but this unit is not accurate enough for woodworking or setup of shop tools -- especially miter saws. The protractor's primary and miter indicators show up to a degree of difference even at square (half of 90 is not 46), and if set to 90, it will not be close to the accuracy of a framing square. It's fast for reading framing and finish carpentry angles on jobsites, but not accurate enough for tool setup tasks or precise woodworking cuts- good within it's lane, but stick to squares for critical setups."
1,Disappointed,"It is disappointing that Starrett, the icon of precision, put it's name on such a poorly made unit.The glue-on decals intended for angle measurement are both mis-aligned and mis-printed, making the tool unusable. If a pointer is aligned to a particular degree marking, the rest of the markings around the compass do not line up with their mates, and miss by as much as 1 degree. Note that 1 degree of measurement error will result in a 1/32"" gap in 2"" wide moulding.Consumers who buy based on the Starrett reputation are deserving of more. It is interesting to note that while the device proudly displays a US Patent number, ""Made in USA"" is nowhere to be found.I bought protractors made by both Bosch & Grizzly and will give this Starrett unit to my grandchild to use as a toy."
1,"Starrett 505A-ProSite 12-Inch Dial Protractor , Returned.","This Starrett tool was not accurate. It may have been one that fell through the cracks during final inspection. Certainly not up to what I expect from Starrett,so I returned the item."
2,Needs Improving,"The Starrett 505A was off by a full degree this is not what I expected out of a precision instrument made by Starrett I have sent it back to Starrett to be ""fixed"" I am waiting on them to return it now."
4,Good Tool,"I'm a hobbyist and started a scratch build radio control boat project. Its required lots of sanding to get the parts just right. After turning my shop into a practical dust pile I decided to get one of these small planners. Turns out this one is just right. A few minor adjustments and its became one of the most used tools for getting the peices to fit just right. I've read other reviews saying it can handle larger chores and will have to agree. For now, it serves its intended purpose quite well."
5,Cool little tool,Husband bought this to trim a few coats of paint and a little wood off from doors and jams in a 50 year old house. Worked great. Didn't even have to remove doors. A lot faster than sandpaper.
1,"Everyone's saying the low reviews aren't helpful, but after getting this I don't get the high ones either...","Everyone's saying the low reviews for this item aren't helpful, but after receiving it I also have no idea what good this item could be for.I have yet to find one thing you can actually ""plane"" with this item. It's basically just a firm razor set at a pretty aggressive angle. On a hard surface, how can you possibly get enough force behind something this small to get any sort of functionality you'd expect out of a plane? Is this designed for balsa wood or something?Have tried both MDF and solid wood with this and in every case the plane either was totally unable to move forward or marred what I was working on with blade marks. I have tried a variety of adjustments on the blade with not additional success.Hate to say it but unless I am just missing some key on how to use this item, I fail to see any usefulness for it whatsoever."
1,Too tiny,It is too tiny. The blade is not sharp. It virtually cannot do any job at home and like a toy.
3,Too tiny for the price,I am surprised at how small this is. And it will be very helpful if a long metal stick is provided to drive this tiny plane instead of thumbs!
4,great service,"Great seller. Item arrived quickly and as described. I needed it for a class and it arrived well before classes started, which is what I needed. I would buy from this seller again."
3,ULTRASONEX SB300U -- NEED ADVICE PLEASE !,"Here is the thing about this toothbrush.I have had it for a few years now, about five. I was able to find new brush heads for it on Ebay when I needed them.I really liked it when it worked.I have read and re-read the documentation but it says nothing about how long it will last or when to know it is fried for good etc.I HATE the fact that it is a totally sealed unit because now it won't hold a charge any more and I don't know if it is the sealed toothbrush itself or the charging base.Either way, it is USELESS TO ME.What do I do, just throw it in the garbage now or what?Do I need to go out and buy an entirely new toothbrush system?ADVISE PLEASE. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS HAPPEN AND WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT IT?THANKS."
3,Can't get replacement heads,"This has been a decent toothbrush. Got it for free with 3 replacement heads, but I don't know if more heads are available."
4,Good Enough,"I bought this toothbrush because my dentist reccomended a power toothbrush (she said even a Crest Spin-Brush is better than a normal brush). I was ready to lay down the 60 bones for a Sonicare and came across this guy. I figured, for it's price, it's worth a try-even if it only lasted a year or so.I compared it side by side with a friend's Sonicare. It's not as loud, and doesn't appear to move as much (has a shorter amplitude of it's brush stroke). The battery doesn't last as long without a recharge, but I can stand to live without a power brush when I travel.In short, this brush isn't as fancy or maybe doesnt even clean your teeth as well as a Sonicare. It may not last as long or look as pretty either. Bottom line: it cleans your teeth great and costs less than $20. Long term reliability is yet to be determined, but none of these things are indestructible."
2,Bought Two... One still works.,After a couple of days of receiving our purchase one of the toothbrushes ceased to work. We (my wife and I) never dropped it nor did we treat it in any way differently than we treated the other one. Occasionally it will work for a couple of seconds but is normally unresponsive and has become a $20 run of the mill toothbrush. The other one works great and is a pleasure to have and to use even though we now have to share.
2,Unreliable,"This toothbrush has stopped working within 8 months of my purchase. It was good while it worked, but with a life this short, its not worth the money spent."
2,Crappy dappy doo!,"Terrible brush doesn't have the power to compete with Sonicare. Either shell out the cash for the real thing or use a manual. When it comes to your smile, why be chinsey?"
2,Was great while it worked,"This was a great brush, but the on/off button malfunctioned, so I can only use it by poking a bobby pin into the mechanism. Also, it vibrates so much that it makes me a little dizzy."
2,Price good but psuedo sonic care.,"I've gotten this and I've got a sonic care. The sonic care head actually moves so the bristles are actually moving. Putting your tongue on the bristles, you will feel the brush head moving along with whatever sonic pulse is moving down at you.What is not clear is that these Ultrasonex the handle vibrates. Yes.. you feel a vibration but for cleaning you must brush like a regular brush rather than gliding it along like the sonic care.For the price it is a low end sonic toothbrush but in comparison to a lot of toothbrushes, ironically a rotating brush head without sonic beat them all."
4,"Great for the price, but it packs a punch","This is a great brush for someone who likes to really feel it when brushing they're teeth. It has a pretty strong vibrating action that may be too much for some, but I have to say that after using it for a week, I saw a noticeable reduction in the staining that was on my teeth. That in itself impressed me enough to write this review. Auto shutoff is a nice feature and it seems pretty sturdy to me, the only caveat I have is that you need to be careful when moving the brush around in your mouth. Because the brush is so strong, if you hit your teeth the wrong way when moving the brush, you can get a pretty good jolt.Overall though, this brush can't be beat at this price."
2,Good while it lasted...,"This was a nice cheap toothbrush. Unfortunately for me, it stopped working after 2 months."
5,excellent,"I've had this for over one year without any problem. Better than Sonicare with much cheaper replacement heads. I also find it easier to keep clean than sonicare, and the heads seem to be more durable.Don't know about the reviews saying it breaks easy, because I think it is very solidly engineered and reliable."
1,It will only make it a week beyond the 30 day return period.,"Like another reviewer, I found that the brush's on/off switch ceased working about 5-6 weeks after I got it. Worked well until then, but it's mighty expensive to buy if it's only going to work a month."
1,much worse than sonicare,"My sonicare battery was running low, so I bought this because of the low price. Don't waste your money, it's much much worse than the sonicare. The sonicare brush vibrates back and forth against your teeth. The ultrasonex is much less sophisticated and vibrates in all directions, so half the time it's actually banging directly into your teeth. It felt very harsh on my gums.It looks and feels like somebody just stuck a toothbrush on the end of what in polite company would be called a ""marital aid""."
5,"Don't be ""AFRAID""","This saw does exactly what it was born to do. Installed 24Ga 5vcrimp on my own home, now we're doing a buddies. Would recomendfiner tooth blade instead of the one that it comes with. Excellent tool almost as good as a cold or shear cut. Thanks Milwaukee.C.J. VelekSebastian,Fl."
3,Difficult to attach!,Let me first say that I love the idea of this toy. I love that it's eco-friendly and non-toxic. The problem is that there is no safe way to attach it. You have to tie it to something and the cord is not long enough to string across the handle of an infant seat. I don't know how people actually use it. Cords are dangerous for babies too.
3,Great Toy- though not easy to attach,My 4 month old loves the textures and colors. It is also easy for him to grab. The problem is that it is not easy to attach to a stroller- especially one with a canopy. We went to the local craft store and bought some clips that we attached to each end of the chain so that we can now attach it to our stroller.
3,Great 1st effort,"My bookclub read this book... We enjoyed it. I think that Howzell gave a realistic portrayal of how medication is not always the ""band-aid"" or ""cure-all"" in mental disorders. She showed how the main character Rikki felt like [junk] while taking medication and how she acted like [junk] out while off her medication. She showed the struggle one goes through vividly. Howzell tried to wind an underlying ""faith"" in God throughout the story, always going back to it. You don't see that often unless it is a Christian book very often. I think Rachel Howzell Hall is promising and I look forward to her next book."
4,Great Book,"I thought the book was excellent, especially because this is the author's first novel. The characters were well developed and although the storyline was pretty sad, there was a lot of humor in the book. I would recommend this."
4,Serious,"A Quiet Storm was a very good book about mental illness and how is destroys all involved not just the one with the illnes.This book also taught me a few things about how this sickness takes over your mind and how the warning signs can easily be ignored as just a simple depression or someone is just upset about something that you or me might think is stupid and its a really big thing to he or she.This is not the first book I read about mental illnesses, but it is one of the good ones; I will recommend it.Later...."
5,I DID IT MYSELF?,"I've asked friends for advice, got half-hearted tips from professionals and read my users manuals front and back dozens of times ... but nothing has been more helpful than this DVD. After numerous attempts to shoot quality video (I only needed 1/2 as good as a pro), the simple chapters in this DVD allowed me to focus on particular areas and help me get incredible results I didn't think my little camera and steady hands were capable of. And, having a knowledgeable DVD guide walk me through each step while I got out my camera, did some test shots, paused the DVD and saw the results ... well, I haven't found or heard of anything better on the market.My friends and family now look foward to watching MY HOME MOVIES! Hey, I did it myself!"
5,Good Deal,I like the Stanley planes for their combination of quality and price. I had another Stanley Block Plane that I used for years as I learned more about planes. That one had finally gotten to the point that it could still be saved but wasn't worth the effort when I saw the price on this one. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat.
4,I Can't Com-Plane,"Joke aside, I really like this plane. It is my first time working with such a tool, but it has helped enormously. The blade depth is easy to adjust, and replacing the blade seems fairly simple.However, the blade that came with the plane tends to snag on the wood I am working with. Because this is the first time I have used a plane I cannot tell if this problem is due to my lack of experience, which it may be, or a problem with the product. Also, it would help if the plane had a rubberized heel so that when you use the tool it's a little softer on the palm of your hand. I feel like I have bruises on both of my palms due to the blade snagging."
5,Stanley Block Plane,Another quality STANLEY wood working tool. I have several Stanley planes and many Stanley wood working tools. The quality is in the tool.
3,Good for the price,"Good planer for the price, after spending a couple of hours tuning it i would rate it at 4 stars."
5,Smooth,"Great tool for people that know planes. Amatuers will be frustrated trying to set it up first time. First used in High School shop class, so I know planes and their uses. Would suggest using a Jack Plane if space allows.Amazon Customer"
5,my favorite cd,"I'd like to encourage anyone to try this cd, it's my favorite cd that I've owned. I like many genres of music, especially classical with its wide range of ""musical colors"" without words getting in the way. Classical is truly the most widely expressive in my opinion. This cd by Alison Balsom is most incredible to me each time I play it. Words aren't enough to describe it, you have to experience it. If I had to pick one word, it would be ""sublime!"""
4,Brilliant trumpet player,Alison Balsom demonstrates brilliant technique and feel throughout this albumn with a choice of contrasting pieces painting a picture of a mature performer with incredible talent. Highly recommended for the trumpet solo and concert trumpet enthusiast.... you reach the end wanting more!!
3,She still needs more time to grow,"Alison Balsom...I first heard of her when I saw her Caprice video on youtube. I must say, this is some good talent and she certainly brings justice to the trumpet. However, I think that her interpretations are not yet musical enough. She has great dynamics and is able to change her tone a bit but...even though she is able to employ all those technical displays, the musicality seems to be lacking. Even though I hate to compare trumpeters, I believe that she is trying to achieve a style that is similar to Sergei Nakariakov (that is...playing transcriptions which are technically demanding). Unfortunately, her technicality is nowhere near the level of Nakariakov and her musical interpretations still need work. Her style, however, does bear the shadow of her teacher, Hakan Hardenberger. That is to say, she has a clear and open tone.So...all in all...I think her musicality is lacking...for now."
2,Alison Balsom Caprice,"The Bach from Alison was excellent. I didnt like the pieces in this CD as much. Also the captions, if I listen on my computer, are in Japanese"
4,Different cover than shown.,Excellent story. glad that I made this purchase and would recommend the book for others to read. well known Swedish author.
5,toledo's east side latina-juggalette,good job on this cd dasit. i love it!!!!! my fav. song is hater. i hate feminem 2!!!! keep it up. tell Bee-Z his lil'sis friend said hey.
1,Price is a Rip Off !!,This price of $230 is a complete Rip Off. You will get the same box set for a much much lower price. Just go to Best Buy and you will get it for $134 for the same box set.
3,Very unrealistic yet an exciting action packed cliffhanger,"I enjoyed this show for years. While action packed with well placed cliff hangers, this show is 75% unreal. I'm now re-watching it and can't believe the unbelievable stupidity of the people in this show. The characters are just ridiculous, there is no way this much stupidity, nosiness, complete disregard for SOP, poor communication to the extreme, and incompetence could ever exist in any Government agency office. No way."
5,Amazing Shoe,This is amazing television. It will have you on the edge of you couch with suspense all the way through all eight seasons. I will be waiting for the blu-rays to come out before i buy it but for anyone that wants DVDs this is well worth the cost
5,Got my Jack Bauer fix!,"I miss 24 so MUCH!!! I don't know why they ended the series. Every year in Jan, I looked forward to the new 24 season. This year of course was different, no Bauer :( Bought this DVD set and watching it again from the beginning. Feels like a different era watching the first few seasons even though it wasn't that many years ago! Can't wait for the movie (I hope there's one coming)."
1,price gouging much?,"First of all, let me say that I absolutely love the show ""24"", probably the greatest of all time. But price hike from $139.99 to $279.99? i don't think so...one star strictly for price gouging."
5,This is needed on BLU RAY!,"There's no reason why this can't be on Blu Ray as well. And we'll probably see it sooner or later, but we should have it now! If you agree with this, please leave a comment. It'll be our own little petition."
5,"True Patriot! Best Action TV Series! What, no Blu-Ray??!?!","Nothing short of great TV. Loved watching it and always looked forward to the next show. Edge of your seat, white knuckle action! Its hard to resist the whole season at this price, but I'm going to hold out for the Blu-Ray."
4,Beware of RCE!!,"I can agree with the rest of the people here about 24 being an exception series. This is a word of warning to overseas buyers, this series is embedded with the new Regional Coding Enhancement. This means that some of the region free players won't play it (my Kogan TV/DVD is one) make sure you can change the region on your DVD player to Region 1 as it will not play on some region free players. You may need to find a site that gives you unlock codes to be able to do this."
2,Great Series (5 stars) but poor product (1 star),"I received ""24 The Complete Series."" First thing I noticed was the box was separating at the seams. Based on the ""one star"" reviews I opened all the season cases to inspect the DVDs and cases. 7 out of the 9 cases had some type of damage. I did not see anything wrong with the DVD's. Season 1 had 3 DVDs that would freeze up. No problems with season 2, except for the damage case, but I have stopped watching the series to return it back to Amazon.I contacted Amazon to get a replacement (I was planning on watching all the DVDs and than just replacing the ones that had problems playing and replacing the damage cases) but Amazon can only give me a refund because the set came from a second vendor (Sophie's Movies, LLC). I see no reason to order this set again from Amazon. I'll either order the series from Costco or Fox Connect. This was the first time I had a problem with a DVD from Amazon and they did the right thing by giving a full refund."
3,DVD is not what I thought it would be.,"I purchased this to play in the background at a bachelorette party thinking it was a DVD version of the show.It is actually a behind the scenes ""making of the show"". It's mostly talking and interviews with brief clips from the show. Just a head's up."
5,Super Comparison,Carla Lane did a masterful job of comparing multiple environmental software tools for the enterprise plant environmental engineer. She accurately compared several software tools to make the critical decision for the corporate engineers and accounting teams and has taken the study of these tools to a new level. Carla is not only masterful in her comparison but her accuracy is beyond reproach. She has obviously devoted many hours of study and review for this report. I strongly feel Carla has gone above and beyond what most engineers of her caliber will ever do for a publication such as this.
1,DO NOT BUY HUNTER PRODUCTS,This is an expensive item for it not to work correctly. Not as I expected. Then I searched for filters and they are really high. I wished I had not bought this item. Hunter products are high and then they charge more when you buy filters. This is wrong.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A story in the Heavy Metal by way of Aeon Flux vein.This book contains three separate stories. Nikopol is a prisoner, returned to Earth after being in suspended animation for quite a long time.You might expect a few problems after that, but not to be possessed by an ancient Egyptian god, for one."
3,FAIR EFFORT IN PRESENTING THE TOPIC,"The book could have gone deeper into the topic of proposal drafting and provided the different types of proposal more into detail. A good book for general approach, but need a more comprehensive book for graduate level work. Thus, the book does a fair effort in providing the requisite info to do a good proposal, but it lacks meat in many areas."
5,Over sixty postures from introductory to advanced,"In Yoga On The Ball, medical exercise specialist Carol Mitchell offers an interesting new form of yoga workout combination which blends yoga with the exercise ball concept. Chapters survey how the exercise ball allows the yoga practitioner to build different muscle groups: over sixty postures from introductory to advanced are detailed with step-by-step instructions and photos."
3,fury sets this record straight,"ok don't get your panties in a bunch. i (don fury) recorded 6 songs for this record: No Bridge, Incarnation, Deceived, Covered, Anothers Life, and Fields of Illusion were the original titles. this recording was made and mixed on a weekend with a budget for an EP. i didn't do the other cuts for the record, and had no input at mastering. the original masters are fine. the band sounds more hardcore and raw on these tracks since it was very early in their development., and since we did them in 2 days. (the band survived 2 M80 attacks while they slept in their van that night, near the 4th of july) but - i can't vouch for the final product or the cuts i didn't do, or the fact that there's only 9 songs on the CD. if you're a snapcase aficionado, buy this record even though it's probably overpriced, but don't expect smooth sounding vocals or a slick production vibe. this was the beginning.(...)"
3,I AGREE with the Canadian guy!!,"This album has no real groove, and provides no reason to purchase it. Buy the second album."
3,"not terrible, but not great","I saw these guys live a while back and they blew me away. I went out the following week to get the cd. I decided to listen to it first. I found medeocre music with bad vocals. I wouldn't recomend this cd to anyone but extreme hardcore fans. Their second album, however, is a true work of art."
1,maytag repair,It was not helpful at all. The repair was for an older model that has not been in service for years
5,as above,"I forgot to mention that Judith Ennamorato's book delves into taking advantage of one's intuition in all strats of one's life from personal relationships, to choice of vacation spots, to career choices, to decisions in business."
1,"It was okay, but nothing new",The book was okay but it was nothing new or that I'd hadn't heard a million times prior. She was very critical of the multiracial movement which was disheartening. This book is written in the prespective that if you are half black then you are all black.
5,Great for a McDonald's addict,Looking for a cute gift for a colleague who eats McDonalds all the time?This is cute and a conversation starter..
2,its ok...but...does`nt fit handle very well,I was told the replacment blade might not fit well on handle but I needed it right away. It works for what I`m using itfor.
1,What a waste,"I was actaully excited to get this book but was fairly dissapointed when i had recieved it. here is barely any instuction in this book and most of it is basically like a full on refresher course for those who already know how to do some if not all of this. Not to mention it has use of tools one may not even have. This book, if you want to make any type of animation whatsoever, is not reccomended, unless you just want to refresh yourself after going to a college for this or japan."
3,Lacks some details,"The sections covered are well described and illustrated. Even small test-your-understanding quizzes. Composition and camera angle to create mood and feeling are well done. However for a book on anime I feel there are gaps. I would liked to have seen a section on lip synching, and also something on software animation tools and techniques."
2,A terrible book,I don't recommend this book for beginners or serious animators. It has pretty illustrations and fluff. If you're a huge anime fan who just wants to know how anime is made rather than how to make anime or cartoons then this is definitely for you. It shows a few important aspects to Japanese cartoons such as the coloring techniques and background painting techniques. Those cute ghost effects but other than that it fails to instruct in anyway.I recommend Christopher Hart's How to Draw Animation over this one or Preston Blair's Cartoon Animation.
2,I lacked interest in the lives of the characters.,"The premise of the story could have been a good one. Unfortunately, I found I really didn't care what happened to the individuals. Lack of depth of characters and a dry storyline resulted in a book I really did not care if I finished."
2,Disappointed,"These are the first swim diapers I've ever purchased, mostly because they're required at public pools. I didn't realize they DO NOT hold urine, which seems unsanitary. My son leaks right down his legs every time. They do effectively hold a bowel movement, but if your child were to have a loose bowel movement, I'm sure that would leak as well. I'll be looking into reusable waterproof diapers."
2,The Kindle Battery,"First and foremost, Kindle is an exceptional product. That being said, the battery provided for it, is not. After less than three months of moderate use, the battery that came with the Kindle went from working great to flat dead. I would definitely recommend that you buy at least one extra battery to have around just in case you find yourself inconvenienced by this poor product. Fortunately for us, the pricing on this battery is fairly low. Hopefully, the manufacturer is looking into this and will be providing better batteries down the road. {ssintrepid}"
1,I think the batteries might have issues,"My battery is dead after only 3 months as well. Based on the comments I have read others are having the same issue. Is Amazon looking into this? Are they going to make good on the replacement batteries for customers who have this problem? It's a shame, the device is great. I hope they don't let this issue overshadow the device's good points. Take a lesson from Apple when the iPod had battery issues when it first came out. FIX IT!"
1,Short Battery Life,I don't consider having a swappable battery a feature - as much as a common sense engineering decision. I can understand to some small extent why the iPod doesn't - as they are shooting for extreme size reduction. However even in their case - it was a mistake.The issue with the Kindle battery is that they die too fast - I'm getting 3-4 months before the battery fails to hold a charge - I just ordered two more because my last one after charging all night held the charge for almost 15 minutes - not useful.I suspect this is either very poor quality control in the Chinese made battery or a design flaw in the charging circuit. In any case Amazon really needs to look into this.
2,battery died after 3 months,"I love my Kindle and use it almost every day. However, after 3 months, my battery just died. I expected it to last longer. Luckily I had a spare. I was reading and the text froze. None of the buttons worked. When I turned off the device the page I was reading stayed on. It did not go away until I took out the old battery. I love my kindle but it looks like I need to have spares all the time."
1,Is something wrong with the charging circuit?,"I have a ton of products with Lithium Ion batteries, but I don't think I've ever seen one die quite this fast. 3 months, and maybe 20-25 recharge cycles and I'm down to an hour or less of battery life."
1,Kindle battery,"While I love my Kindle, the original battery that came with it only lasted a mere three months (and not real heavy usage) and is now dead and won't recharge. And now I see Amazon is sold out of replacements!"
1,Most annoying feature,"I bought a replacement battery and it may prove useful BUT a longer lived battery is badly needed. When I connect to download, I can see the charge decreasing while I wait! Otherwise, in the course of ordinary reading I don't get much more than 4 hours (estimated) . The replacemant battery performs the same way. A longer cord on the charger would be helpful."
2,Short lived battery for an expensive Kindle!,"It was only two months before my battery would not hold a charge for more than a day. I would charge the battery and then when I went to turn it on later in the day, it would show only about one third full, then last only an hour. Very frustrating! This device was too expensive to have such a basic problem like this. When buying the Kindle, you must buy a backup battery! The reader is awesome--the battery--not so much."
5,C'mon; it's cheaper than a watch battery!,"Imagine my chagrin when I went to read a book on my Kindle and it was dead. I was SO sure that this was another product which had failed the test of time. Imagine my relief when my spare battery promptly fixed the problem and it cost me under $20. There is no fee for the whispernet; no continuing fees at all for the Kindle. (Hey, Amazon folks, if you are listening that is a compliment- not an invitation to think up some fees <g>). As well, it DOES have a replaceable battery. I am buying two more and thanking Amazon for making it possible to simply change a battery and read ON.................."
1,poor quality,it's pretty discouraging to spend $359 and then have a battery that does not last- poor planning and aggravating!! and then have to spend another $19.99??
4,"Long lasting, difficult to maneuver","I purchased a spare Kindle battery for an overseas trip. Worried that i would not be able to find a place to charge up the Kindle, and would wind up with a long layover and no reading material. I shouldn't have worried, as the original battery was more than sufficient for my ten day trip, and there were plenty of places to charge it had it gotten low.My main gripe about the battery is that it is a bit difficult to swap out, due to the size and tiny connectors."
1,Do not buy this battery!,"I love my Kindle. But I hate the battery. The battery that came with the Kindle lasted about 4 months of moderate use. I ordered this replacement battery and it lasted through 1 charge. I am recharging it for the second time and it won't hold the charge. I am sending it back as soon as I can. Don't waste your time and money with this battery, as I see there is another battery now offered on Amazon for the Kindle that is 4.5 stars."
1,poor quality,"The Amazon Kindle battery is of very poor quality. I have had to replace it now for the third time in only eight months of Kindle ownership. Most recent battery only lasting 2 months. Was rave reviewing Kindle products, now much less enthusiastic."
1,Need Kindle 1 Battery,"My Kindle 1 is about 8 months old & quit working - not sure if it's the battery, but after a phone call to amazon that is what was suggested. So, they are giving me a free battery - the only problem is that the battery is out of stock. I ordered it on 7/21/09 & am still waiting for one. Good thing I still have plenty of hardback & paperback books. I will not be very happy if once I finally get a battery the Kindle still won't work. Then I'll have to waste more time talking to amazon again and getting the kindle replaced as it is still under warranty."
1,Kindle battery,"I was given the Kindle last September as a gift. I love using it. However,I am on my THIRD battery! It is not even a year old.I don't keep the Kindle powered up when not reading, and rarely go on line to order books (takes away too much battery life). I only use the battery to turn the page.I know this is a problem for Amazon. I just wonder if they are working on a solution or does Jeff want me to buy the new version or the new nine inch? Perhaps Amazon can let us know what they are doing to correct this problem?Tom Putnam"
5,Entirely satisfied,"Fourteen months after I purchased my Kindle I found it slowing down a bit. I ordered a replacement battery, installed it with no problem, and now my Kindle is good as new. I have read the ""less than satisfied"" reviews, but that was not my experience with the Kindle battery."
1,Dead Kindle Already,"Purchased two batteries for a first generation Kindle. Inserted one , charged completely, used for books over the next week or so. charging twice. Turned Kindle completely off when not reading and wi-fi off when not downloading a new book. Left inactive for three weeks, completely off. Now it will not turn on or take a charge. So disappointed in the battery life! That is why I bought two, had a feeling this would happen. It has happened to me before. Why is the battery so short-lived? A friend purchased a Kindle after I told him how much I enjoyed mine. His original battery still works! This was at least three years ago. Why can't I have a battery like his? Now family and I have spent over $100.00 on batteries. Would have trouble giving positive recommendation."
1,Battery died,My wife's battery died after just 3 months of use. This device shouldn't have such a short run on battery life. No excuse.
2,JK,The battery lasted only 3 months after the purchase of my kindle. Was very disappointed in the battery lasting only for 3 months. The battery only needed to be charged every 10 to 14 days and I used the kindle almost daily.
1,Never in Stock!,"Amazon is quick to suck the $359.00 out of your wallet for the Kindle but when you need to order a back up battery to keep the thing running, expect to wait MONTHS for it!It doesn't make any sense that they make the Kindle available but yet it takes forever to get the needed battery for it EXCEPT that Amazon is self-serving and only cares about the huge profits it makes from the Kindle but could care less if Kindle purchasers can keep using it or not.I'm very disappointed, to say the least, especially since I like the Kindle so much."
3,Dead already - update,"Purchased 2 months ago and already does not hold a charge! This is the second or third replacement I have purchased over the years, and the previous ones were like new, not this one. Unfortunately I cannot return anymore. Not happyUpdate: I saw another comment that said to do a hard reset to improve the battery life and that seems to have worked for me"
3,Surprised,"Didn't think I had to order so many other things to enjoy the next generation, that I have. Could have gotten better result from another brand priced 50.00 less and in color"
2,Battery Quality ?,"I purchased this in Oct 2010 and have kept it charged as well as possible yet the battery is kaput. I want to keep my Kindle 1 running just because, no real reason, I have two later versions. At the same time at $20 a pop the batteries are beginning to cost too much.The charge plug does not work well, it has to be inserted very carefully to get the battery on charge. Poor quality there."
5,kindle battery,The battery is for the 1st generation kindle. It was as advertised and came to me in the time described. The battery works fine. Thank you very much.
3,1st generation Kindle,"My hubby gave me my kindle on dec 17 2010. I am still running on the same battery. when new it lasted about 3 to 4 weeks before needing a recharge. at over 2 years old, the battery is lasting around 2 weeks. I suppose it depends on how big of a reader you are. I used it every night and sometimes through the day. My hubby calls my kindle, my 3rd arm. where I am, so goes my kindle. :)"
3,Disappointed in battery life,"Like many others, I had to replace my battery after 9 months on a first generation Kindle which, quite frankly, I didn't use that often. Based on other reviews of the same problem I decided to buy two new batteries. I assume that this will happen again and at least I won't be stranded on a long plane flight with no reading material."
5,Kindle battery,"The original battery in the Kindle died for reasons I don't understand. The replacement battery was a bit difficult to install, but it works fine."
5,Are you leaving your whispernet on?,"I have had my Kindle for over a year and have never had to replace the battery. I leave my kindle on all the time, but only turn on Whispernet when I have purchased something and want to download. Leaving your kindle on takes virtually no energy because the putting up of the eink for each page is the only thing using energy, so the only time your battery is being drained is when you turn pages or use your Whispernet, and it lasts a long time for only turning pages. I never recharge until I am at the end of the battery, unless I am going to take it somewhere where I won't be able to recharge. I definitely think it is a good idea to have a backup battery if you use your Kindle daily like I do. I would be lost without my books."
3,The Battery Life.,I have had my kindle (first gen) since Feb of 08 and have only had a problem with it not keeping a charge the last 3 months. I am now getting a replacement battery. thanks
1,Wrong model,Evidently there are multiple battery model numbers for different versions of the Kindle 1. Guess what happened next. How do I return the wrong one. Turns out I needed a Model S11S01B but got sent a Model A00100. Who knew?
2,Less than a year and completely dead.,"The original battery lasted three years, this replacement lasted less than a year and holds absolutely no charge. I'm very disappointed here Amazon."
4,Kindle battery review,"I bought this battery because the old one did not seem to be retaining power as long as it had, however the new batter does not seem as powerful as the old one was when new. That one would last 3-4 days before needing to be charged whereas the new one seems to be needing to be recharged every 2-3 days already."
1,Battery Life Untenable,"My first battery, with moderate usage, was good for about 6 months. I had the wireless on all the time and the standby time was acceptable. Once I hit the 6 month mark the battery wouldn't keep a charge more than a few hours so after reading similar reviews I ordered a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement hasn't faired much better. It will only keep a charge, WITHOUT use, for barely a day, then dies. I love the device, but this is unacceptable. Luckily, I can still read my books (but not my subscriptions) on my iPod Touch, but I would still like to use the device I spent so much money for."
1,Never in stock!!!!!!!!!,Like the others I'm frustrated. I ordered the replacement battery early in January and never received it! I finally cancelled the order because I'm getting rid of my kindle!!! The battery it currently has only stays charged for one day and that is without Whispernet on!Whichever family member takes this off my hands will have to deal with the battery problems.
1,Poor Kindle I battery life!,"We have all kinds of battery driven devices around our home and office. In comparison to the others, Kindle I battery life is truly exceptionally bad! Obviously poor engineering! Amazon should recall them!I'm glad we delayed getting a Kindle II given our experience with the Kindle I and that Kindle II batteries are four times as expensive and not user replaceable!I eventually did buy a Kindle 2. Battery is fine so far. Our Kindle 1 has now required it's second replacement battery."
2,Kindle Battery,"First, I Love My Kindle and it is the best gift ever that I have received from my hubby. I have only had my Kindle for approximately 4 months and I had to replace the battery becasue it died without any indication (and thank goodness I read about having a spare on hand). WOW. Research really needs to be done in this area because I am ordering another replacement battery for the future."
1,What a Shame!!!,"I have owned my Kindle for 4 months. LOVE IT! Been the biggest RAVING FAN of the product... and then, the Battery dies.Is it under warranty? Shouldn't Amazon recognize the problem and provide a Free Battery replacement within the 1st year of purchase. Shame on Amazon for not being more accountable.Now the battery is on backorder without an ETA, and now Amazon is going to charge me $19.99 for a sub-standard battery that probably cost them under $5.00.I am NOT a RAVING FAN ANYMORE."
2,Amazon is NOT the only source for replacement batteries.,"I received my Kindle for Christmas and after reading the reviews decided I'd better order the replacment battery before I actually needed it. It's now March, I'm still waiting, and my Kindle is very slow and has to be charged often. I Googled ""Kindle replacement battery"" and got a fairly good list of companies that have replacement batteries that will fit the Kindle. The prices are good and the company I decided to order from (Battery Ship, Inc.) will mail to an APO address (Amazon won't.)"
1,What good is a replaceable battery if it's never in stock?,"I've had the replacement battery on order since Feb 9 (now over a month). Still no estimate of when it will be available. Contacted the ""Kindle support team"" - no one knew anything. More disturbing, no one showed the slightest interest in finding out why the batteries have been out of stock for months."
1,Battery is dead,After 8 months of very light us the battery is dead. I've got four subscriptions which I've cancelled (a savings of $27 per month) since I can't use the damn device. I just called customer service and they tell me they've been out for months. Is this a joke? In my opinion refunds should be given to those who desire them since the device does not function as advertised (as an e-reader) with dead (unavailable) batteries.
1,A Kindle without a battery is useless!,"I bought my Kindle in July, 2008. The original battery lasted 77 days. The second battery lasted 71 days. The third battery lasted 75 days. I ordered a fourth battery in November 2008 and I am still waiting for it. That means my $359.00 investment is dead, useless. Furthermore, when I called Kindle support, I was told that Kindle batteries last ""years."" When I took issue with that statement, the phone went dead. I began as an enthusiastic recommender of the Kindle. No more. Amazon needs to level with its customers about the durability of its batteries and why it is unable to supply replacements. Even more importantly, it should recognize that having banked my $359.00, it owes me a refund. I would be very interested to know if others have had similar experiences."
1,Useless Product,"The idea of having a pre-charged replacement battery for my Kindle 2 is sound, however, it came with no instructions relating to how to install it. Therefore, I have been unable to use it when my battery is getting lowww. Hence, it has not been of any value to me at all."
3,Order extra just in case...,"I ordered the Kindle six weeks ago and just received the Kindle unit. I ordered the battery as a back-up just in case at the same time. I am glad I ordered the back-up battery when I did...it takes a month or two to receive these items and you don't want to be stranded without a battery. I still have not received the back-up battery, but the unit is working fine with the original for now. But you never know...."
1,Unacceptable Battery Life,"I used my Kindle occasionally only, and the battery was not even three months old when it died. (Well, I'm really HOPING it's the battery.) After paying so much for the Kindle itself, one would think the battery, and all of the other Kindle components would be of better quality. 2/27/09: STILL waiting for the flippin' battery! This really stinks! What kind of support is this from Amazon????? I'd live to send my Kindle back at this point!"
5,new battery for first generation kindle,even though the numbers were not the same the picture did look like mine and it said it was 1st generation. i unhooked mine and plug in new and it worked great.
1,crummy battery,I have only had my Kindle since November 2008 and I'm on my 3rd battery. The poor battery quality is unsatisfactory.
1,Replacement Battery,"If Amazon does not get these in stock soon, another option is to use the internet. I got a replacement battery off of ebay from a seller called dmc-batteries in the UK. The product was delivered directly from Hong Kong and arrived as promised within about a week. Total cost with shipping was about $28. This purchase was better than using the power cord exclusively to read on the Kindle, which is a great product."
1,Kindle battery leaves much to be desired-beware!,My Kindle battery failed within 3 months. It is yet another poor quality Lithium Polymer battery manufactured in Communist China. I had hoped that Amazon would have done better with it's Kindle product. This is not encouraging.
1,Dead in 6 months!,"I had my kindle 1 for 18 months, then the battery died. I ordered this one thinking that it's the one that came with it, it will last at least another 18 months. Wrong! This replacement battery only lasted 6 months. I just replaced it with another on Amazon for six bucks less. I figure I might as well same some money since it seems that once you start replacing the battery, you will be doing this often."
5,Great Amazon Customer Service,"I could not get my Kindle battery to charge. I contacted your very responsive and helpful Kindle customer service person (one that spoke clear english), who thought I needed a new battery since the Kindle batteries do not a have a good record for a log life. I ordered a Amazon Kindle 1 Replacement Battery and received it 2 days earlier than promised, great service. To my embarrassment I found later that I was trying to charge the Kindle with wrong the wrong plug and cord. The original battery is still good but I will keep the new battery as a backup. Thank you Amazon again for your the great service that I have received from your company in this instance and on many other orders over the past several years. Keep up the good work. R BadgerAmazon Kindle 1 Replacement Battery"
1,Will these ever be available?,"After checking this site for over two months, I'm wondering what I'm going to do when my battery dies and I don't have a spare. I expect I won't be the only seriously disturbed new owner out there. Help, Amazon."
1,Kindle battery,"I loved my Kindle, but the battery died after 2 months and replacement is unavailable. Kind of an expensive toy if the batteries are only good for a couple of months and are difficult to replace."
1,what's with the battery?,"I've had my kindle less than a month and the battery won't recharge. Now I see I can't get another one for a while. What is wrong with you people? Didn't anyone ever tell you the product has to work for more than a few days before the battery fails? If you can't get me a replacement battery, and the battery has such a crappy life, what use is the Kindle to me? Seriously guys."
1,Not in stock?,"It is unreasonable that the Kindle 1 battery remains ""out of stock."" It appears to be planned to hasten the obsolescence of Kindle 1, to increase Kindle 2 sales. I'm not biting. If customer service is so bad that they will not support this relatively-new product, even by making batteries available, I have zero trust in that customer service, for anything. I would not purchase another product from a company that is so willing to leave customers in the lurch. Hello, Sony E-Reader."
1,Expensive toy!!,"I loved my Kindle when I received it as a christmas gift from my husband! The battery on the other hand, is horrible! It died after minimal usage! It will no longer hold a charge and when I went to see about replacing it, I found that they are NOT in stock!! What the heck am I supposed to do with this expensive toy now? They have the nerve to come out with a Kindle 2 but have not mastered the problems with the battery for us with the original Kindle....buyers BEWARE....until they correct this problem with the battery I would WAIT!!!!!!!"
5,Great service from my original battery,"I got my 1st generation Kindle in July 2008. Now, almost 2 years later after daily use of my Kindle the battery is slowing down and not holding a charge as long as it should. So, I'm replacing it. But I wanted to be on record that some of the original batteries were very good.Pat"
2,"Well, it's back to print!","Hello!I've been enjoying my Kindle for just over a year now, but the battery quit, and I have been waiting for a replacement battery for a month now. When I saw the many letters complaining about the problems getting a replacement battery I became very alarmed! This is not a cheap toy! And I'm not about to purchase the Kindle 2 just because batteries aren't forthcoming. So I'm joining the chorus of your very disappointed customers.It's a good job books are still available in print form--I can go back to enjoying them as I have for many years.But I do feel a bit ""had"" by Amazon."
3,Kindle backup battery,"I have had my Kindle for a couple of months and wouldn't part with it. The battery is another matter. I wish the Chinese and Japanese manufacturers would settle on a battery standard and that the batteries would be easy to remove and insert.While it is not brain surgery, having to take the Kindle out of its folder (especially since I have Velcro'd it in so it wouldn't fall out), remove the back, pry the battery out of its nest and unplug it and then having to do the same steps in reverse to install the backup is a royal pain in the neck. The Kindle battery holds an adequate charge for everything except a long airplane trip and if you aren't lucky enough to have a power supply at your seat, you must have a backup battery.Why do so many engineers design beautiful products and then run out of brain power when it comes to batteries?So far the replacement battery works fine and it is reasonably priced but I gave it a 3 star rating for the above reasons."
4,extra battery,"I have not used my extra battery but just wanted one on hand in case and when it was needed. At $19.99, I felt I could afford to have a spare on hand. I just could not go back to the time before Kindle. I will always keep a spare battery but have had my Kindle 6 months and have not needed it yet. My Kindle has opened up a whole new world for me."
4,Kindle Battery Life,"I absolutely love my Kindle, but I, too, am not 100% pleased with the battery life. My husband gave me my Kindle for Christmas. I immediately charged it up and played with it for an hour or so, but I had just started a ""paper"" book and wanted to finish it before reading on my Kindle. By the time I got back to using my Kindle, the battery was already dead. I charged it up again, bought a few new bestsellers, and proceeded to read. The second charge seemed to last forever..probably 16 to 20 hours of usage over the course of 3 days...so I thought the first experience was a fluke. The next charge lasted a long time also. But, I charged it up this past weekend, read for a few hours, shut it off at 50% power and the next day when I turned it on, the battery power was almost at zero. At this rate, my battery won't last the 3 months everyone else seems to be getting. I'm definitely going to get in line for a replacement battery or two."
5,Battery,The spare battery works as advertised. I didn't want a Kindle that could die because the one battery for it expired.
2,Battery Problems,"I love my Kindle and was looking forward to taking it with me out of town when unexpectedly as I was reading, the pages no longer turned and it just froze. I tried to charge it but it still would not function. Having had it only a couple of months, I couldn't understand what was wrong. Then I realized from reading the comments from other users that it was the battery. I hurried to order a new one but got a message that they were out of stock. This is really a let down. Surely they will not allow poor battery performance to undermine an otherwise very good product. I have no idea when I will receive the new battery they said they would send an e-mail when it is available."
2,Amazon should provide a $200.00 credit to owners if they can no longer supply the battery,"If Amazon cannot provide customer service by supporting the products they sell(kindle 1's original battery) then they should at least offer a newer replacement Kindle to the customer(with batteries that are still available or selfcontained). ""don't know when the replacement battery will be available or if it will be ever available again"" what kind of nonsense is this? OK, Amazon!! I paid $300.00 for the Kindle 1 and I expected you to supply the original batteries(not by some fly-by-night outfit with batteries that don't last 3 months) for the lifetime of the Kindle. Would you please make your original batteries available or send all your owners of the Kindle 1 a new Kindle HD with the selfcontained batteries for the trouble you're putting us through. The longer you wait, the longer I will no longer be buying products from you."
2,Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I love my Kindle. But something is wrong with the replacement battery. The original battery lasted just shy of 2 years. That was fair, and so I didn't hesitate to order a replacement one that is supposed to be exactly the same. Unfortunately, it lasted less than 4 months. What gives Amazon? That's not even close to the original. And, while I love e-books, there's got to be nothing worse than a dead battery on vacation. I guess a paperback is the way to travel."
1,You have to be kidding me....,"After two months, the battery won't recharge? I would never recommendsuch an inferior product to friends, colleagues or associates.This product idea is wonderful, but it fails terriblyon the execution piece."
5,Kindle replacement battery.,"The replacement battery arrived on time, was the correct item, was simple to install, and works great."
3,Not as long of a wait as I thought...,I ordered the battery on March 3rd. It shipped on March 28th. Not near as long of a wait as I'd anticipated after reading all the negative reviews.
1,"Lousy battery, failure to deliver","In November I ordered two Kindle batteries a week apart. One of them finally arrived in February. I was then assured the other would be shipped soon, whatever soon means in terms of Kindle. Now I am told that both have been shipped quite some time ago. If the second was shipped, I don't know where it was shipped to, but it didn't get to me. What use is a Kindle without a battery? And Amazon is lying in its teeth about how long the battery lasts. It might last as long as advertised if I read one page a day."
2,Kindle battery dissapoints me big time,"The replacement battery and the original lasted about three months each. Not happy. I read a lot, I was under the impression the first time was a fluke, guess not. And since they are back ordered I am SOL but so is Amazon but they will now lose an easy $50 or more from me ordering every month plus I had planned to buy one each for my son and daughter for Christmas. I like Amazon but I want quality and when I want to order I want it available. Suggestion, for those that go through a lot make an offer of automatic shipments of battery at a discount or make the battery last longer."
2,Bad Battery,"I love my Kindle which I purchased in October but I am now waiting on a new battery. I can not get over how soon this battery died. Come on now, you know you can do better than this."
1,I Am Not Alone--Battery Gave Up The Ghost,"My Kindle 1st generation had been getting glitchy lately after charging the battery. The Kindle would not turn on. A couple of times, after hitting different buttons, and turning off/on, the Kindle came alive, but I noticed I was charging the battery quite often as the battery croaked in short order. The last time I used it, the Kindle seemed to have a psychotic break, blowing its gasket-mind and leaving a dead Kindle shell.Therefore, I looked up the replacement battery online and thought $20 wouldn't be so bad, until I read the reviews here declaring the battery life was very short. So, I thank all of you who wrote your reviews, as I found them informative and have decided not to buy a new battery.What a waste of a great product, though. Like buying a fine working machine (the Kindle), propelled by a tin metal heart (the battery).I think the Kindle needs to take a walk down the yellow-brick road and ask the wizard for a new heart."
4,Replacement Battery Kindle,Replacement battery comes without instruction on how to install it.ie. How to open the Kindle to install the new battery. ( 1st Generation Kindle)
3,battery,"I haven't been able to figure out how to put it in the Kindle yet.When I am able to figure this out, I will write a review."
3,WHA?????,"Ok, I JUST saw this, and this is messed up... I'm still trying to figure out whether I like it or whether it[s bad], which is why I am going neutral by giving it 3 stars. For a small budget movie, the production values are great. The 16mm black and white cinematography is great... but the story? Messed up! I am still in my train of thought on this, so I will end this by saying that I think it is a little too violent for most people's taste. Actually, it definately is."
1,"See the ""sequal""","Tetsuo's II features a less-than-obvious story as well- but it is better written and the effects are 10 times better than this one's (which is understandable).However, Tetsuo does have a lot of the same interesting visuals and is very much a film to go see with fellow film buffs at midnight showings at your local art-theater. An art-house film in every sense of the word, Tetstuo certainly isn't for everyone, and I don't think it's meant to seen alone. Truthfully, I find this film entertaining, I give it a 1 simply because it really isn't a good film, it tries too hard to be prolific and throws out anything that resembles a plot.This is supposedly a black comedy, and except for some sexual-inuendo, there's not much in there (could be a trans. problem though).Incidentally, the short, 'Drum Struck' is equally (if no more-so) weird."
2,"Blew My Mind For Sure ""we will rot the world with our love""","ok so i'm asking this to everyone after they saw the film, did this make you want to die, it was just so weird. while watching it i was just mezmorized on how messed up it was. when the guy runs out in front of the car and gets it and that music just starts planning i think my eyes rolled to hte back on my head, the story line was really hard to follow. It's not that i didnt like the film i just got bored with it even though it fraked me out. But my taste may be sour becasue my friend that i bought it for for his birthday watched it 4 or 5 times. so who knows"
3,Surreal Mechanical Horror...,"Tetsuo is a surreal horror film about a hit and run accident where the driver begins to grow metal objects on his face. The metal objects are physical reminisce from the accident and it begins to physically haunt him. This metal curse grows worse, and the driver seem incapable of escaping his faith as he becomes dangerous for those around him. Tetsuo is a daunting cinematic experience with an interesting story and at moments the cinematography is remarkable. However, the very same cinematography uses several still shots put together to a continuous shot in order to create movement, which becomes repetitive and clumsy. This visual awkwardness creates a music video atmosphere that lowers the overall cinematic experience."
4,Grind,"A simple tale of a man who turns into a giant metal monster, accompanied by suitably extreme noise-core techno / metal, 'Tetsuo' just is. There is a plot, of sorts - the film would make less sense if it ran backwards - but it's not really very important. Instead, the high-contrast, starkly grey-and-black imagery passes at different speeds, with occasional pauses for single words of dialogue (mainly 'OOF!' and 'USSS!'). There's a really nasty sex scene too, one that will make you wince and laugh out loud at the same time.Despite being inexplicable, furious, and one of a kind, there was a sequel - in colour, and with a polished look, it had a plot that trod a fine line between being evocatively minimalist, and standard Anime cliche (our hero has an evil brother, you can guess the rest)."
4,"Powerful, frenetic, a bit self-indulgent","If this were a student film, it would rank among the best ever made. Powerful, wild, inventive, great driving noise soundtrack, it gets a bit self-indulgent in the last half -- it's probably ten minutes too long. But it is definitely worth seeing, far better than Tetsuo II. It will make you shiver and howl."
5,Eraserhead eats sushi!,"This hyperkinetic film has a raw energy not unlike a film student's senior thesis. It's a dark, nightmarish tone poem, a really scary exploration of man's obssession and reliance on machines. As brilliant as Eraserhead, a stunningly original work. The sequel was dreaful!"
2,treading a fine line,"reading reviews of this film and looking at the back of the box i was expecting a completely over the top, mind blowing film. i must admit i was kind of let down. narratively the film is all over the place with little or no story to speak of but the big problem was this film came across as being really cheesey and stupid at times. i think the true test of a director is to make a low budget film that doesn't seem cheap. some perfect examples being lynch's eraserhead or aronofsky's pi. also this film wasn't really that 'disturbing' or 'crazy' at all. there are a few really incredible images but they're not enough to save this film. i'm going to give tetsuo II: body hammer a chance in the hopes that the bigger budget solves the abovementioned problems."
5,Thee best independent film i've seen yet,A very twisted plot...Raw twisted visuals.sick yet you can't take your eyes off it... for pure industrial fans... awesome music too... remnicent of old school industrial scene... have an open mind..not for the weak hearted.....
2,this is a special edition??,"my somewhat lower rating is for the entire package - my perception of the total value of this release.I must admit i have kinda an issue with this being refered to as a ""special edition"".I was quite disappointed in the (lack) of supplements.You get the movie itself(just barely over an hour long),a few excerpts(?) from other Tsukamoto's films and some trailers for other Tartan ""asia extreme"" titles.You also get some basic text on the director and a few actors.The outer slipcase is cool,but is it worth an additional 10 bucks?Bottom line,I feel that this is an important film,worthy of a special edition ""treatment"" but got short changed here.Even a brief interview with Shinya woulda been appreciated!"
1,shocking!,"this movie is shocking alright shockingly bad.I had heard about tetsuo for about a year and ahalf and thought that it sounded really interesting.I finally decided to buy the movie and was absolutely disgusted.I saw it once and thought it was junk and then i went back and read all those great reviews the movie got.So,i decided ok let me see it again,and i was right it is junk!Never have i seen such a contrived and art house wannabe movie.Everything fails,from the scenery to the acting.I know this movie had a very low budget to operate on but even still the special effects are horrid!Not for a single second did i feel that he was turning into metal because it just didn't look like it.Anyways,i wish i could have that hour or so that i spent watching this trash back.I can only hope that the director of tetsuo sees my review and gives me my money back.(i paid $24 bucks by the way)Anyone who reads the other reviews,just dont believe the hype."
1,Boring Pointless art film,"This movie was just a long, boring art film.It was more of a series of scences and montages, as opposed to a plot and story.If your a film student, or like pretentious art films, then you will probably enjoy this one, its ripe with imagery you can descontruct, and compare to fritz lang.If you aren't a film student and just want to watch an entertaining movie, this isn't it, get oldboy or 3 extremes."
3,Nice looking toy,Looks great but my three year old finds it difficult to pedal. He wants to be able to go on longer distances but it is just too much work for him.
5,Heavy duty,"I brought this car for my girls 2 1/2 years old. They are still too little to peddle it, but it is a tuff machine. I guess it will be better for 3 1/2 year old kids, you have to have long legs to peddle, but still very good for the money and it will last a long time."
3,pretty good box set,there are only a few flaws with this boxset 1st not all the films are widescreen 2nd its a cheap boxset by that i mean the dvd boxes are the slim boxes like the friday the 13th collection i might take a pic of it and post it so you know what i mean. i hope this help you!
1,Just plain bad,"Being a Western New York native, I was eager to read a murder mystery set in familiar places; however, if I hadn't suggested it to my book club, I would have thrown it away after the first 15 pages. Besides blatant grammatical and editing errors, it switched tenses, had hoakey, contrived, and unrealistic conversations, and the main character had an obsession with going to Tim Horton's!! What prominant developer do you know who would allow his daughter to live in a trailer park?There was one good thing about Lake Effect. (...)"
5,Brilliant!,"This is such a fun and well-done documentary. Not only is it extremely entertaining; it offers such a unique perspective on themes such as self-discovery, sexuality, and the dynamics of children's relationships. I highly recommend it!"
3,Put the camera on me!,It's a yong boys pure movie.We cannot be a move critic watching it just feel like had that age and probably would not did nothing much diferent.It's fun anyway.
5,"Stunning, Lively, Unpretentiously controversial!!!","OK - you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes therin - then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban 80's. More than any movie I has ever seen, the film deals with burdening sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human, never dull, and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the fear-frenzied adult world where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgivings as the patriarch of strict kid's world. What he finds in himself and others isn't always pretty - but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age. What does change mean without reflection. I love this movie."
5,"Simply wonderful, just like the author","As one of Dr. London's patients (that's not his real name), I feel honored every time I talk to him on the phone or have an appointment with him. But that's not what this review is about. It's about a tremendously smart, superbly funny and surprisingly insightful series of essays about doctor-patient relationships. Dr. London has his patients -- and readers -- pegged. Now that I've read this one, I'm getting the rest of his books."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting insightful essays of the type that Atul Gawande writes (cf. ""A Surgeon's Notes on Performance"") which combine anecdote and research. The first few essays of this book (I then gave up), mostly consisted of poor attempts at humour."
4,A small bit disappointing,"I bought this book in awe of it's historical information, and perhaps to gain more understanding of the Torah, and also of It's background. It is a disappointment, however in the way Plaut approaches the text. He is a ""modern"" man, with the view that the Torah is not the word of God proper, but a record of the Jewish people. This offended me, but for those of you who agree with Plaut, it would be perfect for you. However, even to th conservative scholar, like me, this volume cannot be disregarded, on account of it's historical explanations."
2,Disappointed,"I give Torah commentaries as Bar/Bat Mitzvah Books. It looks as though the publisher has cheapened down this most important book. Compared to the one I use, the cover is not as rich looking. The inside paper is not as nice. The corners were bent from the plastic it was sealed in. The price is much less than in a store but I'd rather pay the price and get a better quality. I was not proud to give this gift but didn't have time to return it. I will investigate to see if it is the same edition everywhere and if so will buy the Stone edition."
5,The Torah: A Modern Commentary,The organization of the revised edition makes it so much easier to use. As always the commentaries of W. Gunther Plaut are insightful. This was a Mikveh presemt.
5,Clear eyed spiritual instruction,"Plaut's commentary on the Torah offers a breadth and depth of insight bordering on the divine. Revealing ancient culture, historical context and spiritual guidance, the commentary does more than any other text to put this faith and its ancient roots in a usable format."
4,"A New Revision, but the old version still useful",This revision makes the basic commentary a bit more modern. The divisions of weekly portions is better than the last version. The old version is good enough unless the reader of the revision is a scholar.
4,Audience Noise and Chit Chat,I love most of the songs on this CD. The only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is I don't care for the audience noise and the chit chat before and after songs.
5,One of Her Best Live Offerings,"To me this CD and her later One Voice are her 2 best Live offerings. I did not care for her 1996 Tour and it's many CD offerings as that tour focused too much on her Broadway, and other movie related songs and did not feature enough of her more contemporary offerings.This concert at the LA Forum was part of a larger benefit for the 1972 Presidential Candidate, McGovern, and came at a time when Barbra was already a rare and reluctant live performer.She mixes up the song well and her set was tight, simple and polished just enough. Her hits are here; People, Happy Days Are Here Again, , covers are here; Sing, Where You Lead, and some rare live reads; On A Clear Day (you can see forever).The treasure here is Stoney End, after an ""appluase-o-meter"" duel with Second Hand Rose, Stoney End won, and proved that she can sing just about any genre she chooses to do.McGovern may have lost, but we all won with this one of a kind live performance."
3,One of his good CDs BUT not the best,This CD had some of his best works but there is a lot better songs he made at that period.
1,Don't waste your money$$,My mom recently introduced me to YANNI. She plays it every day in the car and I cannot stand him. He has the wierdest look and I think his music is wierd! So my advice is don't even bother to buy this CD!! If you could give this CD no stars I would but you cant - so i cant.
3,"Great fabric, poor fit","Love the fabric - very soft, not too heavy but not as thin as most tights. Problem was the rise. Seem to be a bit short/low-rise style although not advertised that way, when pulled up to natural waistline, became very uncomfortable in the crotch, no way I could ride in them. Never experienced this before in a riding tight or breech, not sure what the problem is, but where most tights/breeches have a panel in the crotch area, these just have a seam. Sent them back."
5,Longtime Friend,I have used this (old) version since I was in college in 1961. I feel very fortunate to have found a replacement copy through Amazon. A bit expensive but well worth it. The new versions don't hold a candle to this one.
2,Terrible movie,"My grandfather is in this movie which is why I purchased it. It's barely watchable, if that. Unless you have a relative in it and/or want to support local (Tulsa,OK) film-making, stay away from this one."
3,Docudrama Style,"I don't know if the people depicted in this movie are real or not, but it is done in a docudrama style, which probably accounts for its less than slick Hollywood production values. The story is weak enough that it seemed to me they were trying to get in the relevant facts of the prize fighter's life. I do have to say that having gone to university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, it rang true as being set in that area. The local boxing promoter made me think of the late-night advertisements for a local furniture store back in the 1960s. I think this movie would be of most interest to folks who lived in Oklahoma during that time period."
1,Waist of time and money,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen. I'm a boxing and ultimate fighting fan and also like martial arts movies. The fighting in this movie is a total disappointment as well as everything else. The boxing is awful, which is the main reason I rented it. There may have been one somewhat entertaining fight but all I can really remember is seeing men basically slapping each other. The choreographer, director, or whatever didn't seem know what boxing is actually like nor put much effort into the fights. It looked like they just picked guys of the street and had them pretend to box. Fighting doesn't have to be realistic to be entertaining and too much realism will look sloppy and can be boring (I've seen many boring boxing matches). This is just sloppy."
4,an aquired taste,"This film is not everyone's cup of tea. Two Maine backwoodsmen, a bit ""woods-queer"" as exteme rural Mainer's have been called, allow their lives to be filmed and their opinions to be heard.The greatest social event, involving 4 people, is the slautering of a pig. From then on we learn about working oxen in the woods, making snowshoes, trapping beaver and rural Maine in the heart of winter. The notes about the production and the interview of one of the men years later are well worth watching in the special features. So is the recitation, from memory of ""The Cremation of Sam McGee.""Aside from the general warning that this is not for the squemish or oversensitive (particularly women, who take some hard hits as a species)this is a good study of the life of these hard working recluses."
5,Zen Productions,"This is my favorite movie of all times. You have to put your self aside for a while and just take in this movie. Yes, they kill a pig and yes they are offensive to women at times, but if you can get over that enjoy. The movie teaches you humility, and sets you back to take a look at your own life and realize how important the little things are. I watch this movie every Sunday, it's kind of my church. It is fun to watch two souls live the way that they wanted to. Two amazing souls who have since passed on leaving this footprint for the rest of us to examine.Enjoy"
2,not my style,"2-stars only because his mixing ability yea it sounds great and well produced but this type of watered-down progessive trance leaves you wanting somthing more. kind of boring I'm more into hi-energy dance music like Voodoo&Serano,Ferry corsten,Warp bros. Dumonde,BT,brooklyn bounce,paul van dyk,666,and even Scooter.if your a fan of Armin and teisto you will probably like it. not my cup of tea. the only track on both disc's that i can say i like is cd-1 track2 I found you by intersate. buy a ferry corsten cd and find out what good progessive trance is all about."
3,Not bad,"This is my first introduction to Markus. I really enjoyed some tracks like #1 and #2 on Cd1. Some tracks were a bit boring and lacked energy. Generally speaking the cd contains some good mixing, not many errors, flows well etc. Progressive style but definately need to spice things up especially in cd#2. It really didnt do too much for my energy levels so he gets a 3 star."
3,Not better than the first,"Markus Schulz... Great remixer and DJ I won't argue with that, he's one of the biggest of his time. Personally i didnt like this Various Artist release because of the tracks... Progressive Trance seems to be gathering more listeners in the electronica/dance scene. But honestly i think trance is getting worse, ive been listening since 99' up to now i stopped enjoying trance as it aged after 03'... and have moved on to more of the house scene. Back to miami 05, its great for what it is... i liked coldharbour sessions a lot better with his remixes of oceanlab, airwave, andain, and motorcycle. This VA release has many great producers also but i expected to hear ""coldharbour sessions part 2"" ... which wasnt a good idea. So if you decided to take a listen don't expect Coldharbour Sessions 2. Not bad, it's just not my tasteBut what do i know im from texas the scene sucks here."
1,don't waste your time,This is a very cheap product. One of my most regretable purchases. Not even good for on site rough work.
2,Stanley Wood Plane,I was disappointed with the adjustment knob. It is made of rubber and very hard to turn. The directions that came with the plane were very poor and almost useless.
3,Has some annoying glitches,"I am happy with the overall performance, when it's working. But little things that I experienced make me wonder had I known this, I would have chosen other brand.What I experienced is as follows:SOMETIMES, especially if you play non-DVD discs (my case, music CDs), the unit does not recogonize the discs already inside. So you have a stereo which won't run, only showing NO DISC. Even with, say, two DVDs in it, the LCD in the panels might indicate inaccurate status.I called the help line. They suggested to unplug the stereo to ""reset."" Then the only option is to call the factory or service center. I told them it's only two days old, I could just return the whole thing to Amazon, asking whether they can swap out the DVD only (rather than the whole box with speakers and everything), and they never provided me with any answer. They just want you to go to warranty center."
2,Could Have Done Better,"Well I guess as far as the product I shouldnt have bought it refurbished. The delivery time was great and it shipped faster than expected. It plays good quality music and movie sounds, but it does not play movies without skipping, even brand new movies..."
4,Sturdy Grill Brush,This is one of the sturdiest brushes we've used. I also like the fact that it came with a replacement brush head. We tend to go through those quickly.
1,"A toy, not a grill brush.","I purchase this item based upon the previous reviews. To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. After a single use one third of the bristles on this brush were folded over, rendering them completely ineffective. In fact, the bristles are so lacking in density and rigidity that it is impossible to obtain any meaningful results using this brush. I would liken it to trying to clean a grill with a hair brush. A complete waste off money. After spending $14 on this, I have no choice but to spend more money on a decent brush. My advice: buy a quality brush to start with."
2,Grill Brush,"Best part is that the head is replaceable. Have only used a couple of times so far, and have had some of the bristles come out."
3,mixed,"great design. well thought out, and fairly easy to assemble. poor product quality, not close to what even a lower level Thomasville company should be. the finish was scratched, and in places peeled. wood split. the drawer front was missing. shipment damage included a dented top. to be fair, an 800 number is there to order replacement parts free of charge, so we'll see what shape they arrive in. I have the matching hutch and buffet with similar damgage."
3,Satisfied,"This item was fairly easy to assemble. You have to be careful not to peel the paint, though, so watch for that. The door had a little bit of extra paint on it which I will have to clean up, but I don't think that will be too tough. The door also sits a little below the drawer, so there's a bit of a gap. It was shipped in good packaging, so no damage. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase for the price. It's attractive and decent quality."
3,Good Deal...,"I recently moved in with my girlfriend and the small apartment we share with the kitchen was in need of table space so we got this product as a resolution. We were very happy with the price and although there is some assembling require, for myself it was simple. The only complaint I have is that the grooves on the door of the chart were in need of paint. I simply just took a little brush and some white pain to that and bingo best looking piece of furniture for the price. Regardless, great deal and was happy we selected this as a solution."
3,some issues,"We purchased this item to use as extra storage in our kitchen. It arrived in a timely matter. However they did not include directions on assembly so my husband had to spend at least double the time just figuring out the construction. Going directly to the manufacturer's website did not help resolve this matter. One piece of the wood (the cabinet door) also arrived warped, like perhaps it was exposed to humidity and then allowed to dry back out... In any case the door is bent and will not shut properly. This particular problem is probably a fluke (or so I hope) however we did see that others have complained about not getting assembly instructions, which is just shoddy and inadequate business practices."
5,A brief comment,"Probably Carvey's best flick, it sports an amazing number of cameos by famous stars, in addition to the wacky comedy of Carveyand Bell, who complement each other perfectly. This movie and the sequel remain my favorite of all of his roles. Even after all these years, the jokes and the gags are still as funny as ever.I knew Dana at San Francisco State University before he became a star, where he used to entertain us at dorm parties. We always knew he had talent, and knew he would go far some day if he only got his chance. Luckily for him and for us, he did."
1,Bad,It took way to long to get my product. I order it in the begaining of december.You need to ship faster
3,ryan hickneys waynes world review,"i think these movies deserve 3 stars because there wasnt really a point to them. they were funny though, especially the 2 one. the first one was ok."
5,Good package for value & extras,"Aside from both films being very, very funny (and a rare case of the sequel being better than the first film), this is a great DVD package, with the 2 DVDs being cheaper as a set than bought individually, and some nice extras like director's commentary tracks for each, etc."
1,the author lacks credibility,The idea of Mr. Pippert lecturing on ethics would be laughable if it weren't so downright frightening. He has absolutely no claim to any moral high ground whatsoever. His anti-Semitic comments are legion and vicious. I can think of many more qualified men to postulate on our nations moral obligations. Asking him to dictate our morality is like asking David Duke to lecture on racial tolerance. ...
5,Delicious,"Okay, I didn't personally sample the KMR, but according to a couple of my other cats, it's very good. After reading Susan's review I expected the worst at trying to mix up the powder. Fortunately, I used my sports drink shaker with the wire whisk blender ball, and ""voila!"" easy as pie and not a single lump. I even stepped up and started the 2nd stage KMR and the shaker took it in stride. The smallest amount I made was 1/2c warm water + 1/4c KMR + 3/16c 2nd stage. It's more than the two kittens can eat, but little momma eats about half and really enjoys it also."
5,KMR is the best!,"KMR - kitten milk replacer - is an animal rescuer's godsend. Many a baby kitten, squirrel, raccoon and other baby wildlife have been saved by this miracle powder (its also sold in liquid form). If you rescue animals, you should also have some KMR and PMR (puppy milk replacer) on hand!"
4,Good Milk Replacement,"I have used KMR in the past several times. I prefer the liquid KMR but the cost for me is prohibitive when the kittens are very young and need milk for several weeks. If you can afford the liquid KMR, then that is what I suggest. Otherwise, this product is the next best thing."
2,A simple intro to PageMill with much key information missing,"This is a very simplistic introduction to PageMill with many key instructions either missing or buried between the lines of the overly-cutsie prose. For example, the Attributes Inspector has a key menu that allows the detailed placement of graphics - this menu is never mentioned nor is an illustration of it shown anywhere in the book (I only stumbled across it accidentally). Also, several files are not on the accompanying CD. Finally, it is very hard to concentrate when reading such rubbish as, ""...do you recall seeing a funny looking bull's- eye... Surprise! That bull's-eye..."" ad nauseum. Although the book is 418 pages, only 135 deal directly with the technical aspects of PageMill; all the rest is vague generalities about web design, hosting and outdated information about web software."
5,This girl can really sing.,"I have both Veronica's cd's ""V...as in Veronica"" and ""Rise"" and let me tell you she can really sing! This cd is so awsome! I love all the traX! I really hope she comes out with another album after she finishes playing Selena on Broadway. This cd has hits like: ""no one but you"" ""rise"" ""release me"" ""60 wayz"" ""some1 to hold"" and many others, get this, its tight!"
5,"A good book about Unicode, maybe the only one","This is a very good source of information about the Unicode standard. Being organized as a primer makes it much more useful for someone who doesn't know much about Unicode compared to the Unicode standard document. It discusses the Unicode standard in depth, dealing with topics like bidirectional text and CJK. It also discusses Unicode implementations in Operating Systems and its support by programming languages."
2,DO YOU NEED A PREMARITAL AGREEMENT?,"Jacqueline RickardComplete Premarital Contracting:Loving Communication for Today's Couples(New York: Evans, 1991, under the title Save Your Marriage Ahead of Time)(New York: Evans, 1993, paperback edition) 225 pages(ISBN: 0-87131-739-7; paperback)(Library of Congress call number: HQ734.R536 1993)A breezy book by a womanwho has a premarital contract with her second husband.The focus of this book in on the process of creating a contract,the basic content being left to lawyers for both parties.And as with all legal premarital contracts,the basic content deals with what happens in case of divorce.Nevertheless, there are some common-sense ideasthat ought to be considered by all couples, married or not.If you would like to find better books on relationship contracts,search the Internet for the following exact expression:""UNMARRIED COUPLES---RELATIONSHIPS CONTRACTS---BEST BOOKS""."
5,Excellent find!,My 9th grade English class is studying people who had or have Courage. Finished the movie. Did a Webquest. Was able to share information and photos from this book to document as evidence what happened. Do you know that many of my students did not really know about the Holocaust? Only thing I need is a document viewer instead of walking around with the book.It was published by the Anne Frank House foundation that is the museum. My students really liked it.
4,Best book out on Dowsing,This is one of the best books on dowsing I've read. The author gives you the theory and the practice side of things and covers all the basic dowsing tools and techniques. It's a short read but that doesn't mean it's short of information. It's not as complete or thorough as I would have liked in some areas but it's a GREAT book on the basic principles involved. To pick up where this book leaves off on geopathic and earth energy dowsing try the Healing Sick Houses book listed below. It's the perfect compliment.
5,Wedding present pruchased from Amazon wedding registry.,"I bought this slicer for my daughter as a wedding present. I would never have thought of this product but it was on their gift registry and when I saw it I knew it was just perfect for them since they are vegetarians and love cooking and food preparation. After their first use of it she sent me an email describing their dinner. This is her description- the ""pasta"" is sprial cut raw zuccini (using the turning slicer...) and uncooked pasta sauce (made with the food mill) - a great summer meal - She also attached a picture of the meal and the ""pasta"" is beautiful, a really lucious green striped linguini. She is very enthusiastic about the slicer and told me it is fun and easy to use.Benriner Turning Slicer"
1,It may have a quality name - but like other items over the years its lost something,I was really unable to determine the blade widths and it definitely is not for a spiral french fry - its more for a hash brown version. It seemed to be my best choice since I didnt want a commercial motorized version; even though I do fry various potatoes at least once if not twice a day. Beware - I cant fault Amazon and I may use it for other veggies in the future - IT would be great for french fried onions that I had in the past which were thin and crispy deep fired and dont contain the grease at all like the battered onion rings do; I went with the good rating the name carried but as any out of the Country Products - buyer beware
5,Come On Over Baby Rocks!,"This new single from Christina Aguilera is da bomb! It shows a more mature version of this Teen Queen. Her vocals make it a lot better, if this was sung by anyone else it would just be another song, but Christina does a superb job! I can't stop singing it."
3,come on over baby,"When I first heard this song, I really liked it. I think Christina Aguilera has a great voice, and she also performs great. She is one of those performers who can actually sing live, even though a few weeks ago she has lost her voice temporarily. I like the back round music to this song, and her voice is great and strong. She has another hit, but I don't think it is as good as ""what a girl wants"". But still, it is a good song to listen to when you are just in the mood to listen to the radio."
5,Definitely Christina's best song yet!,"This CD single is a must have for all Christina Aguilera fans. Christina has got a very powerful singing voice and this is just a fun pop song. There are only two tracks on this CD single but it's well-worth it.1.) ""Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)"" [enhanced video] ~ the version you hear on the radio...not on her album. The video is really awesome, too. 5/5 stars2.) ""Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tu)"" ~ the Spanish version of the single, taken from Christina's Spanish album. This is just as good as the English version, but I still like the English version more. 4/5 starsAll in all, you must own this CD single if you love the song. It's the only place you can get the radio edit version of ""Come On Over"".I highly recommend the ""Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)"" CD single.Score:99/100A+"
3,Good song but the single is pretty skimpy,Come on Over Baby is a pretty good song but the cd is like under 10 minutes. They could have thrown on a few remixes and dubs for good measure. All in all the song is pretty fun but i think she overdo's those breahty little whispers in the background of the song.
5,Best Song ever!,"Christina Aguilera,One of music's hottest artists has done it again with this chart topping remix of Come on over! This Genie knows how to sing!!! This song makes me wanna dance!!!!"
1,"Sounds like a 7-11 ad. Stupid song, but great voice",This is the worst song... Sounds like a 7-11 ad. I can't beleive she actually put this out. Come on she can do better than this. She needs someone else to write her lyrics. Whoever's doing it now doesn't know what their doing.
3,One of my gulity pleasures,I remeber going to see this movie in May of 2002. I wasn't in the mood to see the big budget Spider Man so I checked this one out. The film has a talented young cast in everyone from Brad Renfro to Johnny Knoxville.The fight scenes and cinematograpgy are all good and Scott Kalvert has made a film on par with his first and still classic The Basketball Diaries. I really thought after this the late and great Brad Renfro would go on to greater things but sadly he didn't.
4,"Don't Listen to the ""Critics""","I found this to be an excellent movie. As soon as it ended, I rewound it and started watching it again. I am a big fan of the 1950's and I like the street gang lore, so perhaps I am a bit biased. If you're not a fan of the 50's and you're not interested in movies about street gangs, don't bother. Otherwise, purchase this video! You will definitely love it. The cast is wonderful and the scenery really takes you back in time. The soundtrack is great too, with goodies such as Dion and Ritchie Valens. What are you waiting for? Get this movie!"
5,An Underrated Film,My favorite movie of 2002. I wrote Norman Reddus and told him he did a great job as Marco and he wrote me back...Cool guy. Great Flick
3,SO BAD IT'S GOOD,"This movie has many, many flaws. Fairuza Balk is way too old to be playing a teenager dating (portly) Brad Renfro; the dialogue is totally corny; and the camera work is awful. Other than that, it's not a bad movie. The story is very, very much like many movies you've already seen that were better: The Outsiders, West Side Story, A Bronx Tale, etc., etc. The soundtrack is excellent; the scene with Fairuza and Brad in a steamy pool is hot. Definitely worth watching for any one who likes movies about the 1950s/Italians/gangs/teenagers. My favorite BAD line is when Brad Renfro says it's 115 degrees outside, even though HE is the one wearing a leather jacket!"
5,Verge for the masses,In this book Roger Verge presents many of the dishes that make southern French cooking so popular. Many of the dishes are easy to prepare and give excellent result. Accompanying the recipes are numerous personal anecdotes which make the book come to life. Without a doubt Verge's best book for the average cook and in general one of my favorite French cookbooks.
4,"Still great, Still HARDCORE!","What more can you say about this band. Darkest Hour's lastest release is what puts the hard in HARDCORE. This band successfully takes the things that make metal so great and combine them with their hardcore take on it. They stand above most of the other metal bands as orignal in their own way. From the beginning song A Cold kiss to the almost 9 minute metal orgasm of The Last Dance Massacre, this band amazes me with their hard rock guitar and their chilling and deep vocalists screams. The only way this album flaws is in it's repetativeness. The bands last album is very much like this one, so to the untrained ear this is a copy, but being a HUGE fan, I love it all. If you like death metal or hardcore, definetley check this band. Personal Favorite tracks: Another Reason and So Sedated, So Secure"
1,Not a good read or for those just starting,"The question and answer style of this book doesn't make it easy to read. There is too much stop and go and makes this book annoying. Also, the pictures don't exactly diagram welding techniques. If you are a beginner you should probably get something else. I returned this book."
2,Looking for practical information,"Decent book if you are looking for information on the various types of welding, related equipment, etc. Too academic if you are looking for practical information to help you start welding. The question/answer format was a little annoying. I felt like I was back in college taking a test."
4,A good textbook,"A good ""text book"" stye publication covering a very wide range of welding and cutting methods, but not an ideal book for persons looking for an ""introduction to welding"" manual. I would have liked to see the author add some basic projects, leading the reader thru all the steps with some good photos of common mistakes and how to avoid them. Still a very worthwhile reference manual to have..."
3,crap,"I've been using this scraper since i bought it and can say it's not worth the money. Came in a bright yellow, i was expecting the one in the photo, blade quality is poor, dulls quickly, blade also rusts like no other. But will get you through a job or two. I am now using Ettore's scrapmaster and as a window washer love it. i would recommend ETTORE'S scrappers, stanleys suck."
5,Excellent book for beginners/intermediate students of French,"Another good workbook for my quest to learn French.This one may be a little too elemental for intermediate students,but it will help with reviewing what you think you already know,and may not!This is one of my favorites.I think it is a great help to me,and I hope,to you."
2,Something is missing...,"So apparently there is some kind of textbook/CD that is supposed to accompany this. I didn't realise this when I ordered it, but it says on the front cover ""The Just Listen and Learn Method"" and the back cover also indicates that it is supposed to be used in conjunction Just Listen and Learn French. I wish there had been some mention of this somewhere on Amazon. I'd love to be able to use the book. It looks like a decent workbook. But it is clearly not a stand-alone workbook and I'm struggling to use it as such. Buyer beware, I guess."
2,Only one side,"One side is nice. The other side is meant to be hidden, has all the protruded iron fittings etc. How do you find a place to set it up where one side will be hidden? This is a challenge. Thus 2 stars, as I would not repeat the purchase, and have not yet resolved usage for the unit received -- that is, where this could be hung that would be compatible with its major design flaw.IF this were two-sided, then I'd 5-star it, based on current sell price of a stained glass piece at $6, together with its stated spec of holding 30lb weight.Also, what makes me particularly sad that this is not displayable at both sides is the consideration that this would have looked especially lovely as a hanging mount for one of those stained glass animal flappers made by this company (BirdBrain)."
4,"Peter Buck's Performance in ""One""","While REM and U2 are both excellent bands in and of themselves, the union of the two was something that should, in the future, be avoided. Michael Stipe's vocal ""stylings"" provided an interesting outlook on ""One,"" but poor Peter, his backup vocals were off-key throughout the song. For me, that killed it."
2,To many errors.,"The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks. And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use. The author hasn't even taken the trouble to put up an errata list.Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.There are better books. For an introduction read Neural Networks by Kevin Gurney. He puts great emphasis on conceptual understanding.For further studies there is Neural Networks by Simon Haykin, which has the mathematics."
4,A fasconating account of the early years of Old Rhinbeck,"This book portrays the early years of The Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome from the stand point of one of the early participants of Cole Palen's Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome. It is a MUST for thoes who are intersted in Old Rhinebeck or any aviation inthusest.E. Gordon Bainbridge writes about how Cole started the Airdrome, how the airshows came to be, and how Gordon helped Cole out with the Aerodrome.Over all it is a great book about one mans dream turned to reality."
4,good product but has flaws,This is a great addition to your xm radio but it is a little difficult to use since you have to point the remote directly at the front of the radio to make it work. I have enjoyed it and am glad I bought it!
5,Works like it should,"Bought a Roady Xt and needed a remote to go with it. No set up, just insert the batteries and it is ready to use."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the Roady Xt Remote Control and received it promptly. However, it did not work. I called the seller, and they promised to send me another one. I have not received it.Roady Xt Remote Control"
4,Good Remote,New to XM and wasn't sure if I had to sanc to get the thing to work as no directions. The radio came and it worked perfect.
2,Poor Range For A Remote,Remote does not have a very good range. It has to be within 1' to work so is not functional in a room.
5,Wonderful,I had to install my XM radio away from the driver position and it made it hard to change the station. So I started looking for a remote to make it possible to change the station while going down the road. This remote has made all the difference for me and my XM experience.
4,worth the money,"Nice. I use them in the basement of an old house which has some dampness. The old wood ones always smelled. Being heavy duty, I put a benchtop across them and it works great. The only con is that the doors don't open easily. Overall well worth the money."
2,Some parts NOT included!,"Ditto on all that was said in the other 1 and 2 star reviews, but shockingly I did not see any review mention the MAJOR security flaw of one of these units. Did anyone else notice that even if you lock the doors someone can still open the top of the entire unit by pulling up on it???Oh, and as the title of my review suggests we had missing parts. Luckily, we bought 2 of these and had enough (barely) to assemble 1 full unit. Awaiting a replacement from Amazon for a now more than incomplete unit that was missing a base, shelf or top and 4 whole poles/columns.Sheesh Rubermaid, really? Really?"
5,Rubbermaid Cabinet meets its task,"Excellent product, holds a lot of stuff. Easy to put together and all the parts were included. Would buy another one."
5,Garage Storage,"Love the Rubbermaid Base Cabinet. We purchased two 72-inch cabinets and two base cabinets. They look great across the back wall of our garage and they are extremely sturdy. No worry about rusty metal shelving either. The cabinets come in panels that snap together very easily. Looking at the product specs, we noticed the Rubbermaid storage products weigh twice as much as the other brands like Sterlite and Workforce which makes for a better product when it comes to storing paint, metal tools, etc. We ordered these cabinets through Amazon.com and loved the fast shipping and customer service. We highly recommend Rubbermaid products and Amazon.com! A+++++!!"
2,Not worth the price.,Wow what a piece of junk. If the cabinet would have been priced at $15.95 then it would have been an okay deal. First off the carton it came in looked like it just came out of the dumpster and had three miles of packaging tape to hold it together. Then the pieces themselves looked like they were manufactured by some grade school kids. The bottom piece had a hole in it which looked like someone punctured it with a screwdriver or some other dull object. At least the cabinet went together pretty good when I used my rubber mallet to help the poor quality pieces snap together. As I said it's worth about $15.95 and that should also include the shipping.
1,When will it be shipped?????,I notice my replacement product has yet to be shipped..5 days; Hard to meet a 2 day delivery.....
4,perfect or outdoors,Wanted an enclosure for my outdoor patio to hold pool and garden supplies. Will hold up and the price was right.
4,Garage Cabinets at a Great Value,"We recently purchased several of these Rubbermaid products for garage storage in our new home. They are very affordable and are surprisingly sturdy. We had been forewarned (in an earlier review) that the shelves may start to sag if too much weight is placed on them, so we put all of the heavier items (such as 10 gal. paint cans) on the bottom shelf. Compared with the much-higher cost of stainless steel cabinets, these cabinets very adequately met our storage needs. Assembly is remarkably easy - if my extremly ""unhandy"" husband could do it in 15 minutes or less, anyone can! One note of caution regarding the doors: the plastic on the side where they affix to the cabinet does need to be trimmed, otherwise the doors will bind. This must be due to a slight manufacturing defect. They can be easily trimmed with an Exacto knife so it's no big deal."
3,Not the quality I expected.,This is a very functional cabinet and it assembles easily. The quality is not what I expected from a Rubbermaid product. The plastic is not as sturdy as I have seen in competing products.
3,Could be better,"This seems like a decent design and as though it will hold up in my garage, where wood or metal would be likely to deteriorate. On the other hand, it has a number of negatives. The manufacturing is rather shoddy. Everything fit together, sometimes with difficulty. The place where the lock goes is very flimsy - a mouse with manicure scissors could probably cut right through the thin plastic - so the locking feature is not well designed at all. Shelves are very sturdy, but not adjustable. Appearance is not too bad."
5,Sumptuous Book,A beautiful book that raises knitting to an artform. I'm saving it until I retire so I have time to tackle one of these magnificent projects :)
4,"A beautiful book, however...","It's been said already that this is very much a coffee table book. I love just flicking through it and admiring the beautiful design elements. I am glad I have this book for the inspiration and the production quality gone into it. There are a few problems with the patterns though: the photos are artsy, and don't always give you a clear idea of the garment construction or how it really hangs; The graphs cover huge areas (ie are small) and printed in the colour of the photographed item, which pitches dark grey against blue for example; and most of the designs are not things that you would wear as they are. Realistically, I would only knit the children's cat jumper as it is. Most of the other patterns aren't structurally flattering, so I would only use the graphical elements but not follow the patterns as they are. However the graphical elements are the most beautiful I've seen."
2,Impractical Knitting,"I wish I hadn't bought this book. Fibermom ""chomposy""'s excellent review said it all. Except for the cute cat motif pullover for little girls, I can't imagine anyone actually wearing any of the garments in this book. Even then, make sure to consult the little girl first. That said, the photography is gorgeous. When I was young and dumb I sometimes fell for stuff like this. I love to knit for the sensuous feel of the yarn. Furthermore, if I have some knitting on hand I can talk as long as she wishes with my darling mother who, at 88, is suffering some cognitive impairment. However, I prefer to knit things that I know will be worn, and I've become fairly good at picking such projects. If you want to immerse yourself in a complex, far-out knitting project which you will probably only wear once at most then this is the book for you."
4,"This is the stuff of dreams- it is fantasy for the novice, cocaine for the knitting artist.","I can only aspire to these exquisite pieces of design and workmanship. I didn't see anything I could knit today, maybe in a year, or two, or three. Maybe my mother could have knit these. Certainly my great-grandmother- I have a hat she knit in the 19th century. But these knits are so inspiring I wanted the book to see what the great can do, sort of like visiting the Louve or the National Gallery or the Art Institute for inspiration. Maybe if I tweak a more ""common"" pattern just a bit this way or that I will catch some of the fire, or subtle beauty. I you are a competent knitter with sweaters behind you, you might embark upon an epic journey to leave an heirloom of beauty to future generations - or as a gift to someone you truly love."
5,"Beautiful Dancing, Cute Choreography","Volume 2 of Amira Mor's instructional video series. She teaches a choreography to ""Habibi Ya Eini"". It is a very cute choreography with beautiful dancing. The video is 30 minutes long. I would not recommended this video for beginners however, this video is geared towards intermediate dancers. Basic moves are not broken down. If you are a beginner, you should start out with ""Bellydance your way to Fitness""."
1,TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY!,"Amira Mor is a terrible bellydancer. Her videos are very basic, simple, boring, trashy, in bad taste as well as uninspiring. The bottom line is that she stinks. Amira Mor and her DVD's are like a bad stripper trying to belly dance for a sleazy bachelor party. Belly dancing is supposed to be an art that is classy, elegant, timeless, tasteful, beautiful and technical. This DVD is so bad, it is embarrassing. All of Amira Mor's DVD's are awful, each video is worse than the other! Learn to strip with Amira Mor is more appropriate titles to this DVD's."
1,SHAMELESS,AMIRA MOR IS NOT AN AUTHENTIC BELLYDANCER. ANYONE CAN PERFORM A STRIPTEASE. THERE'S NOTHING ARABIC OR TURKISH ABOUT HER MOVEMENTS. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VOCABULARY REGARDING MOVEMENTS? DOES SHE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RHYTHMS? WHAT'S EVEN MORE DISTURBING IS HOW YOUNG SOME OF THESE PERFORMERS ARE. HER DAUGHTER IS ONE AND SHE'S NOT EVEN 17 YEARS OLD.
5,Excellent,"The item came quickly (way before it's delivery date), was in great shape, and I am completely happy with my purchase."
5,Excellent,An excellent reference for my botanical art classes and also to use at home. After all botanical art is an exacting art form that requires much practice.
3,SUBPAR CLIFFHANGER NOT TOO BAD,"SUBZERO is a subpar version of Stallone's 90s CLIFFHANGER. While not nearly as well done as its predecessor, this movie is a decent enough thriller with some good mountain climbing sequences and a fair modicum of suspense.After a device capable of instigating satellite attacks on major cities is lost in the mountains, a team of experts is assembled to find and deactivate the device.Costas Mandylor leads the average cast with Linden Ashby as his old buddy. The special effects are pedestrian but the movie moves along well enough and is ultimately a satisfying adventure."
1,My mistake,"When I rented this DVD I mistakenly thought that Subzero was the title of the movie. I didn't realize that it was actually the rating of the movie. Sub Zero.A lot of money must have been spent on helicopters but unfortunately they mustn't have had enough money to recruit good actors, storywriters, special affects people etc, etc. Actually one of the special affects where the building explodes on top of the mountain looks like it was made with the same move editing software that I use for my home movies. That software only cost me $50."
3,"Nice, but not great","It's a good plane, but not amazing. I was disapointed to see that the mating surfaces between the frog and the sole are rough-cast and painted.It took a bit of grinding with a surface grinder to true-up the surface, and I had to replace the two screws/washers that hold the frog down with much stronger screws and washers so that they wouldn't deform as they were tightened.I'd recommend spending the time to REALLY sharpen the cutter before using it. And definitely spend some time getting it to work the way you want it on scrap wood until you are getting the results you want.The way mine came, I needed to do a bit of work before it would stop gouging deeply on the left-side. Would not produce a smoother surface if it was wider than the width of the plane.Now it works quite nicely, so just spend some time with it, and it will start to perform nicely."
3,If You Like Spikey,"Joico JoiGel Medium is the only gel I use for my short spiky hair. Perfect for creating that style you love right out of the shower or after your workout. Medium works best for me because I can still rum my fingers through my hair without feeling my hair crunching. Works great for blow-dried hair as well giving you the perfect style without a lot of fuss. And best of all, it doesn't have a strong scent. I want people to smell my perfume, not my hair gel."
4,An indispensable book for CFD researchers,Very good book. Clear & rigorous. Rather for applied mathematicians than enginners.
2,"Informative but NO pictures, only some cheap drawings","I was very disapointed. It is very technical writing. If you want a WTC souvenir book with color pictures, don't make the same mistake i did. Wait a few weeks or months. I am sure that somebody is going to write a good rememberance book about the WTC."
4,Very Informative,"I really enjoyed reading about the life of the Twin Towers. I just wish there would of been some pictures. It was very interesting about how they built it and how daily life went on in the building, before it was attacked. I now look at ground zero in a different light, from the information read in the book."
4,A tribute to the Twin Towers!,"I don't think I could ever get over the events of September 11. I lived in Manhattan for a long time, and it seems unbelievable to me that the Twin Towers no longer exist. The Manhattan Skyline is naked.I bought this book to educate myself on the amount of work that went on to create the world's most impressive towers. The interview with the architectures was quite impressive. This book also explains how the Twin Towers became one of the most lucrative and important assets to the economy. However, I was also looking forward to some illustrations of the towers, which, I'm afraid, there aren't much of those in this book.These towers and the lives lost in them shall be remembered for a very long time. Purchashing various books on them is like paying a tribute to them."
4,2-star coffee table book becomes 4-star window into history,"Let's be honest. If September 11, 2001 doesn't happen, this is a two-dollar steal at a Kiwanis Club book sale. But now, Mr. Gillespie has given us a nicely written obituary of a monument to urban America. Pre-9/11, I wouldn't have given this book a second look. Now, I'd recommend it as a necessary part of any person's library."
2,Twin Towers: The Life of New York City's World Trade Center,"I, too, was very disappointed in the lack of pictures. I live in Washington, DC, so I was definitely in search of a book for my living room table that showed those beautiful towers."
1,Amateur,"Bad writing. Really Awful Paper quality. No photos, cheap illustrations. A 99 cent book that found good fortune because it was there at the right time. I feel truly ripped off."
1,Twin Towers: the life of NY World Trade Center by Gillespie,"Book is totally MISREPRESENTED (...) It is not an oversized photo book of the World Trade Center (as shown) but a truly boring history (copy only) of the WTC with a disgustingly few, black and white mini-illustrations. (...)"
3,"Clean, orderly and minimalist","The book is a little like the architecture --""The structure draws upon the platonic concept of purity and reduction of information. It is a pair of simple geometric shapes. It allows no multiplicity of readings. What you see is what you get. It is an identifiable object because there are two towers."" (p.179)What else can I say."
3,"A good book, but not what I expected","I thought this book would have had more pictures of the construction of the towers and also some pictures of the finished towers. I wanted it as a keepsake since the Towers are now gone. however there are no pictures and only about 7 illustrations. (cross-sectional diagram, map of layout, etc)It does contain an interesting background to the building of the Towers that is quite an interesting read."
2,Deceptive Dustcover,"With nothing to go on but the cover picture (the reviews have all been published since I ordered the book) I was expecting a photo record of how the WTC was built and images at various stages. This is not the case and although the book contains a lot of well-written and interesting information, there is not a single photograph at any stage of construction. I was therefore very disappointed. A picture really is worth a thousand words and the few sketches that there are, simply do not begin to portray the majesty that was the WTC."
3,fair to middling,"This is not a great novella in my reading, but it has some of the Nab's typical themes: deception, living in the imagination that merges disturbingly with reality, and the simple bizarre. Sometimes I get tired of how many pathetic characters there are in Nabokov's novels and that was the case with this one; it is set among the emigre set perpetually mourning the loss of tzarist Russia, which is of limited interest. Moreover, for sticklers (and lovers) of Nabokov's inimitable style, this is a translated work and as with virtually all of the others, something is lost - I found it very flat, almost two dimensional.Recommended tepidly, but true Nabokov devotees will probably like it."
4,"more fun than his previous three novels, overly cute","I get the impression that Nabakov began shifting directions with this brief novel, a wild farce about disillusion and indifference to the world and one's protective ability to seperate yourself from reality. Certainly there is more of a plot than in Mary, King, Queen, Knave or The Defense, and it is just as gorgeously written. It's really quite entertaining and filled with what (I suspect) grew to become Vlad's unique voice. The only criticism I could give The Eye is the clear swagger of an extraordinarily arrogant author who is basically showing off his talent with the wrong story. Hey, yeah, we know (knew) he could write well, but such a minor work is not the best showcase for the unrestrained pretentiousness I'm beginning to fear as I continue along my path of reading each one of Nabakov's novels. Basically this is a pleasent chuckle followed by a disconcerted 'uh-oh'."
2,A Surreal So-and-so,"Let me preface this by saying I have never read Nabokov, and am only familiar with him thru second-hand knowledge of his works: that is, until reading 'The Eye'. He has quite a following of pretentious college students, and now I can see why. This book is not that great, but supposedly this is not his best work, so it's to be expected. I found that it was empty and devoid of meaning, but written in such a way as to make you think there was some sort of meaning behind it. Nabokov just threw together some very 'deep' thoughts and had the protagonist use irony to appeal to the sardonic in all of his readers. I've seen this done much better in REAL detective novels such as Chandler's, for crying out loud! This is literary? Literary my eye! (pun intended)"
3,A slightly fractured house of mirrors.,"Years ago, I was given Pale Fire by a friend, and for almost three months I read and re-read that wonderful creation and developed an admiration for Nabokov which has remained to this day. I am presently reading his early Russian works, and while they might not be on par with his later writings, they are definitely worth reading. He is a master of both the Russian (I assume this from the superb translation) and English languages and to read him is one of life's great pleasures.The Eye, written in 1930, is concerned with the nature of identity and how the overly self-conscious individual is defined only by how he perceives himself seen by those around him. Although an interesting, gorgeously written book, and hinting at greater books to come, The Eye is the work of a young artist who has only partially honed his craft."
3,Good starting place but buggy example code,"This is good will be a good start that give a beginner in the area of building VM, Assembler and Compiler and how things fit together . I would not suggest anyone to stop in this books as it is still rather incomplete .The major flaws in this book is that the compiler, Assembler and VM examples included in this book all have serious bug which would confuse alot of newbies .For example The assembler would not complain if it cannot find a variable and just skip the variable and would not push it to the stack. However, it still generates a pop instruction for the variable causing corruption in the stack.The next serious bug would be in the VM's relative Index access code. It corrupts the stack if you have arrays in your code .I would really appreciate if the author would have tested the code more thoroughly before releasing it in the book especially when the book is taegeted for newbies."
4,Not your everyday C++ book,"If you are looking for something different than the same old previous C++ discussions, then ""C++ In Action"" is for you. Bartosz physics background gives this book a very unique style and presentation. Having taught introductory, intermediate and advanced classes in C++, I would not recommend this book for beginners. I would suggest this book for intermediate level programmers with 1-2 years of C++ experience that are looking to better understand the language, or hard-core C programmers that are just trying to pick up the syntax of the language."
5,A must for any Sox fan,"When you open your first bottle, you hear the play by play on the final out of the miraculous 2004 ALCS. Second bottle: final out of the almost-as-miraculous 2004 World Series sweep. My kids are addicted, they keep opening me beers. I bought 4 extras in case I ever lose mine. Highly recommended."
3,It works.,"It does what it should, but I think I would have been happier with a smaller rasp, maybe one with and edge to guide the action of using it. I don't think I would purchase another one. I'll probably find one a bit more compact."
2,Handle broke on first use,"Handle broke the first time I used it. I was still able to use it, but the handle is pretty weak. Blade worked fine though."
4,"Simple, Efficiant Tool","This rasp works as described in both comments and amazon description. Mine did not come with a blade and no local store carries it. I suggest buying the four pack here on amazon just in case the blade is missing and you want to start working immediately. I have not had an issue with the handle personally. I plan on making my own wooden handle for it from some scrapwood I have laying around, because I think it unwise to ignore the experiences of other shoppers."
2,"Handle breaking, expensive for a disposable.","This product does what a good rasp does, remove material in a rapid but controlled manner. However, having read the reviews before purchasing, I was conscious of the possibility I would have a problem with the handle, and sure enough on my first hickory stick (bow making) the handle has started to wobble even before I had it floor tillered. I unscrewed it and yes, the plastic screw hole is beginning to split and probably won't last another hour. I went online looking for a replacement metal handle, looks like I will have to make my own out of wood or more likely, just look for another product."
5,NOT a kid's review,"I read this book about 3 years ago and LOVED IT. I was trying to think of books I've read in the past, and this book is still in my top 5. I don't remember the details very much, but I remember that I finished the book in three days, and that says a lot about it because I'm not a very good reader. I couldn't put it down!Ever since, I've been looking for a book like this one; it kept me interested and eager to know what was going to happen next.I recommend this book for younger and older readers. I'm going to read it again, I'm sure. =)"
2,Good product but be check before ordering...,"The product is good but when I installed it, the bottom portion made contact with the CPU pins on the back side of the board. That caused the CPU to short and not work. Maybe my board is old. Just make a note of your board before ordering."
4,A must if you buy the generic heat sink and fan,"A must if you buy the generic heat sink and fan. This is metal, not plastic like comes original on most mother boards. Will stand the test of time and won't break or crack."
4,"Lacks ""Dream Park's"" magic, but well worth the ride","Although missing some of the wonder that made the first novel in this on-going series a unique and highly satisfying work, ""The Barsoom Project"" remains, nonetheless, a very good read. Like its predecessor, the story has several dimensions, managing to succeed as an excellent fantasia on the rarely-studied, yet fascinating Eskimo mythos and magic, a provocative portrait of the likely future of the entertainment industry, and an abosrbing and convoluted murder mystery. Even if Barnes's and Niven's second ""Dream Park"" effort lacks the magic of their first, it is nonetheless a well-crafted book allowing the eager reader to check in on a few old friends, and live, if only for a moment, in a wonderland of entertainment that makes Disneyland&lt;tm&gt; look like an oversized swingset. Also in the same series by the same authors are:""Dream Park""and""The California Voodoo Game""--Dalin T. Error (dalint@hotmail.com)Alvin, Texas"
4,A return to Dream Park - this time with Inuit mythology,"Returning to the ever-fascinating Dream Park, where a bodyguard assignment also reopens a decade-old in-park murder. The game this time involves Eskimo/Inuit mythology - a little more helter-skelter and a LOT more metaphysical than ""Dream Park's"" New Guinea. But I'll come back to the park anytime"
2,Disappointing,"Having read Dream Park many times and enjoyed it immensely with each reading, I was looking forward with great anticipation to this book.The story line was confusing as the progress through the game (Fimbulwinter) seemed to have no connection whatsoever with the Barsoom project. Even at the final denouement the link was not clear, leaving an impression of ""What was all that about?"", and I would have far preferred to see a greater emphasis on the detective work of catching the bad guy than the emphasis that was on the rather feeble fantasy game.A rather disappointing novel"
3,More mystery than sci-fi,"In the follow up to Dream Park we have the continued adventures of the worlds wildest amusement park.There isnt much adventure, and this actually reads a bit more like a mystery than a sci-fi / fantasy read.It isnt bad, it isnt great. I read it because I read all things Niven. So if he published the LA phonebook I would be compelled to not miss out - though I might change my policy afterwards..."
3,"Not as good as the original, but an entertaining read","If you're already a fan, it's a decent buy. But don't expect it to be *as good* as Dream Park!"
1,"If you're looking for good Sci Fi, keep looking","I read and enjoyed the other two books in this series, Dream Park and California Voodoo Game before I even knew this book existed. I was surprised and pleased to discover a third book that fell between the two. Unfortunately, The Barsoom Project was a huge let-down.It reads as if Niven and Barnes wrote an OK outline for a novel but never bothered to put any effort into the actual writing. For example, some information that is very important to the plot is revealed in a monolog by a character that is supposedly so drunk, he can't control what he's saying. Yet he manages to express it all in complete, neatly constructed, coherent paragraphs.The characters are poorly constructed, uninteresting and unbelievable. The dialog is unnatural. The plot is implausible. Plus, there's a romance that is so forced, it's painful.It's no wonder this book was released by a different publisher than Dream Park and California Voodoo Game. It's an embarrassment."
1,An almost schizophrenic read...,"I acquired this book with great anticipation, given the promising title. Unfortunately, it is a confused mix of natural medicine, psychology and spirituality. It seems the promise in this book ends after the title.There are few answers and many buzz words which seem to be pulled from The Course in Miracles and Unity teachings. There are many better sources of help than this book."
5,Be at peace with morning prayer,As a newcomer to leading Morning Prayer I found this book invaluable in developing the understanding and confidence that I needed. During Lent I purchased multiple copies of this for my parish so that others would also feel empowered to lead morning or evening prayer. Fr. Webber concisely frames Morning Prayer in its historical context and provides valuable insights though the use of running commentary in a parallel page format throughout the text of the prayer service. By explaining the purpose of each component Fr. Webber removes the uncomfortable sense of not knowing why or if participation includes recitation of all of the various components that comprise Morning Prayer. After reading this book anyone should feel at peace in leading a morning or evening prayer service.
4,Good for mainstream Episcopalians,"None of the previous reviewers mentioned that this book is based upon the 1979 Book of Common Prayer. As a user of the 1928 version I found it required a significant amount of interpolation but was still somewhat useful. I am an Anglican Lay Minister who has conducted both Morning and Evening Prayer and I bought the book in the hope it would provide some additional insight and understanding of those Offices. To a certain degree it did.Mainstream Episcopalians, being more familiar with the 1979 BCP language and references, will likely find this book helpful.American Anglo Catholics and traditional Episcopalians will find The Oxford American Prayer Book Commentary by M. H. Shepherd, Jr. (now, regrettably, out of print, but used copies are available through Amazon) to be a great deal more comprehensive and, of course, specific to the 1928 BCP."
3,MTV style music video,This is one of my favourite videos. The songs on it are great. The views of Rio are breathtaking. It is more a music video than an instructional video but it shows the three main styles of Lambada dance.
4,"Good workout, but hard to follow the instructor at times","This was a very good workout and I could definitely see results from it. My only problem is that it can be hard to follow the instructor at times. She does not give very good audible instructions. You have to ""watch"" what she is doing in several instances, or you will get lost and miss a change over. Other than that, this was an excellent workout."
3,Sony Service Sucks,"Sony replaced an older es model of mine with this after my old one broke. It took Sony ""9 months"" to replace the receiver. After numerous calls to rude operators with no answers I finally threatened to sue. Only then did I get my replacement. My new receiver has been broken since i got it and am afraid to return it.Sony makes decent products but even the store where i bought the receiver says Sony has the worst customer service.If you want a throw away product buy a Sony but dont rely on their service.I will never buy Sony again."
3,can not commit,"I have been a true SONY buyer for many years, so I have no doubt in the systems quality or capabilities. For the money SONY is one of the best bang for your buck electronic suppliers. I have not been able to try it out as my house burned domn on Christmas night,(we were not home thank God)and I am awaiting my speaker system. As for the shipping of the product from the supplier, I opened the box(es) and removed the bubble wrap and was astonished to find that the speaker terminals on the right side(12 of them to be exact) were pushed to the left undoubtedly from mis handeling during shipping. As I stated before I am awaiting speakers in order to find out if there was any internal damage."
4,great but not for small hands,"Great pad! functional and easy to set up. It is a little heavy and big for kids. My four year old still prefers his logitech precision.I prefer this pad, so no arguing with the four year old :-)"
3,Some shortcomings,"When it works it does so well. The construction and assembly is of high quality, and it looks like it can take some abuse from frustrated gamers.On the downside, it is plagued by software issues and requires a master reset every couple of weeks. Luckily this is easily done, but still not something that should have to be done nearly as often. Also the battery life is suprisingly short (using Eneloop rechargable batteries)."
4,Great Product,This is a great product. It was very easy to install and works perfectly. It also feels very sturdy and well built.
5,Best FFXI gamepad,"I use this gamepad exclusively with Final Fantasy XI Online. I had a normal non-cordless rumblepad and was pleased with it, however, i wanted wireless. This pad has a decent range on it as well as force feedback. FFXI also works with default setting ""A"" just like a PS2 controller.The controller even goes to ""sleep"" when its not being used. I have to press a button a few times to get it to wake up and work.Overall, this gamepad is solid, works well, and is up to my daily tasks."
5,Almost perfect,"I tend to like most of my purchases, and this controller is definitely one of them.It's ergonomic, heavy (thus stable), highly sensitive, and has a nice feeling in the hands. Battery life is acceptable, and its layout goes well with many games. Basically it has what I want from a good controller.I'd been exclusively using this controller (I had two different ones as well), until I got anXbox 360 one. Due to built in support in ""Games for Windows"" products of the xbox controller, I unfortunately stopped using the Logitech one.Unless you're going exclusively for GFW titles, for a different price range, and this is still the best choice I know."
3,Completely stopped working after a year or so,"This gamepad was great, when it worked. It was quite responsive, controls were great, and force feedback was awesome (for the games that worked with it...namely, Jade Empire and......that's it). However, a few weeks ago I was playing it, and all of a sudden it completely stopped working. Just be warned; the life on these things is only about a year."
2,"Exceptional, if you use only one...","The gamepad is of exceptional quality and wireless range. I haven't had a single problem when I used a single device in my computer.I would easy give it 5 stars if there wasn't a very important downside:I bought a second one to play PES2011. About 85% of the time they work flawlessly. BUT in some cases in the middle of the game one of the receivers switches and starts receiving signal from the other gamepad. This is not a PES problem because it shows also in the windows control panel.In the Logitech support forums the problem was addressed as ""unresolvable"" because the device uses DirectInput versus X-Input... That was somewhat confusing and was accepted as an indication that they simply refuse to resolve the issue so the customers are moved to buy newer ""X-Input"" controllers.The fact that you're not really supposed to use two of these controllers at the same time seems like something they should have mentioned in their sales literature, but they did not."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought two to go with a HTPC I built. These controllers work as advertised, have a good 'play' feel, good response, and appear to be well constructed. Wireless range is more than adequate for my living room."
1,Won't Work for Me,"This thing has an OS X insignia on the box. When I plug it into my USB port, my computer sees it fine. Darn shame I cannot make the keys do anything in any application. I called Paul at the help center in Amsterdam. He said he knew nothing of OS X and offered no solutions.I went to the help page. It advised me to repair permissions which I did. No luck.So I called Paul again, he said I had bad hardware. Darn shame I cannot (as a practical matter) send it back from Saudi Arabia. Maybe if you bought it from a local shop, so you could return it, this would be worth taking a chance on."
1,Waste of money,"I have had this product for several years. It has never worked quite right. The logitech software is terrible. You have to configure each game with the correct controls within the logitech software. Now that is a big pain in the you know what. The game I tried it on was Colin Mcrae Ralley 2005. Also tried it on a few other games that I can't recall the names of. I'd really like to have a controller I can just plug in and use, instead of having to program it for each individual game with buggy non user-friendy software...........This piece of junk is sitting in box somewhere in my apartment collecting dust(the only thing its good at)."
1,Horrible,"This controller worked great for about a month, now won't do anything. The red light just blinks and it won't respond. A total waste of money, have gone through four Logitech controllers and none of them worked more than six months. Will never buy from Logitech again.My advice: Get a Niko. They're cheaper and mine has lasted years. Get something that will last, not this piece of junk."
1,Not Mac compatible as stated in Technical details!,"I bought this because the technical specs sayit is PC-MAC compatible. IT IS NOT! The packageclearly states PC...but being optimistic, I openedit anyway - and discovered that the software comeson a mini-disk. Mini-disks are NOT Mac compatible.$30 down the drain."
4,not the best for precision games,"This is an excellent gamepad for shooters and games that play in open spaces, but for old school arcade games like Pac-Man it does not perform quite as well. It is an excercize in frustration to make rapid, precision turns in tight quarters with the d-pad and/or the sticks.The cordless aspect is terrific. Haven't had a problem since I purchased this about 2 months ago. It works very well on the emulator MESS, and [...]."
2,not for MAC!!!,"Even though the site says that it's for Pc and Mac, it's only PC compatible. Very frustrating. Doesn't work for Macintosh"
3,It's not like the console versions of the controller.,"PC game vendors need to really focus on making the usages and functions better integrated so it's same as the consoles. I want the identical experience of a console on my PC! This item works, but after some configuration. Even more time spent if you want to get it to work with a game that is not on the profile list. Why can't vendors work closer with game makers and support the functionality natively? It's not that hard!"
1,Stumbling Rumblepad 2,"Since purchasing this game pad a month and a half ago, I have yet to be able to use it. I thought it was similar to an XBox 360 controller, but found out after purchase that it does not work with every game. Perhaps naive of me, but I thought it would easily work with newer games, such as Far Cry, Far Cry 2, Bioshock, Crysis, Crysis Warhead, etc. It does not (so far). I've tried Logitech's tech service on-line help but to no avail. I haven't had time yet to call their telephone tech service, which they suggested I do, to find out what the issues are. Otherwise it's good looking, and I had no problems installing the software!"
3,Bitter Sweet,"I did receive a Rumble pad 2, unfortunately is was not wireless, but after contacting the seller they not only refunded my purchase but also allowed me to keep the controller. I think that was best service after not getting what I ordered"
1,Does not work with most games,"Every game I tried with this controller did not let me use it. This made me very upset. I did extensive research to see which controller was best to buy, and this one seemed to be it, and little did I know that the games I play don't work with tis controller. I would give it no stars if I could for compatibility."
2,Logitech can stop making controllers,"It's clear that after 10 years of buying different Logitech controllers that Sony has a patten on simplicity.Sony must have a patten on a rounded housing for the analog sticks or why else would Logitech, the best Computer accessory company, make the same poor square housing year after year. This make the analog completely unusable when your playing sports games that require an exact location of the analog to make a pass or shot. Absolute failure on Logitech's part.The raised buttons aren't the greatest either but you can get by. It's a bit heavy and a rechargeable version would be more ideal that batteries but even that is ok.The controller would receive a 4-5 star if not for the square analog housing.Returned.PS2 controller plugged back in to PC."
4,"Great controller, but no feedback with EA.","This is a great controller. It feels really nice in your hands, the wireless is flawless, and batteries last a long time. The analog controllers also have a really nice feel.The force feedback does not work with Need for Speed Most Wanted. I have searched the internet for an answer, but have yet to find one, so hopefully someone here can help me. I have read that newer EA games don't work with this controller's force feedback. I also have a Saitek P2500 controller and the force feedback does work with Need for Speed Most Wanted."
4,Vibration doesn't works in Mac!,"well, as another reviews, im feeling cool with my new gamepad, but is a shame that after read the instrucctions on the package, i found a note that said: "" vibration feature doesn't works in Mac OSX""i Hope, that this comment be usefull in your purchase! Thx!"
3,Cordless convenience but sometime fails in the middle of the game,"In my second week of playing, it stop responding in the middle of the game and I have to reset the battery and hope that the connection resume and continue with my game. I might be pushing the button too hard causing some wiring to loose connection or a flaw in quality control and design. But I like the cordless conveniece as it reduce the clutter in my desk.Pros:* Cordless convenience.* Programmable action buttons.* Two smooth analog button for performance edge.Cons:* Analog button can be hard to configure.* You have to change settings on different game.* Some games are not compatible with the game pad."
3,Well it's better than using the keyboard...,"it is better than the keyboard in most cases... nice that each button can be programmed outside of the game for different game profiles, however actually having it work correctly inside the game is not always as easy. Definitely will take some tweaking to get it to work well with certain games... could not get it to work with Tiger Woods at all... others were hit or miss..."
5,Wonderful pad,works perfectlybattery life is goodwireless range is goodeasy switch between analog stick and dpadvery comfortable in adult's hands
4,"Great product, some drawbacks","I bought the Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 to play pro evolution soccer 2010. its a great gamepad with plenty of programmable buttons, however not fully customizable to this game in particular, especially the analog direction controls. one of the back buttons gets stuck if you press it from the bottom and not from the middle. and not all games give you vibration feedback, like pro evolution soccer. and the bulkiness takes some getting used to, especially if you want to use all the buttons."
4,"Pretty good, overall","Having to set up a total of four of these controllers, it was a little fun getting the right pad sync'd with the right receiver, but once that was done they worked just fine. As usual, the Logitech stuff is pretty good, and if I need more I'll be happy to use this product again!"
4,"Handles need work, flawless otherwise","It has aucuardly placed and sized had-holds, which aren't as big as you'd like. They're noticablly different than, say, the PS2 controler that this controler's modeled after. It is, though, perfect in every other way I can find. Flawless responce, even through walls; sturdy construction; no time lag at all; doesn't interfear with other radio eqipment I have, all's awsome. VERY worth the money, especialy as compared with the price and hastle of a normal PS2 controler and a converter."
4,"Great Product, works at advertised",All in all a very good product. does exactly what its advertised to do. Only problem i have is that it doesnt have an on/off button. If its in my bag with my laptop it can activate the controller through movement.. which in turn can kill the battery. Other than that its a great product 4.5 stars..
3,Works good but for how long?,This Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 works good now but for how long? I hve bought other Logitech gamepads before and the dpad always goes before its time (under a year) cant they make a better quality dpad to go with its product's great feel and responce? SBXL= Jets
2,NO Feedback,"I accidently wrote a review for the wired version of this gamepad but will update here because this is what I bought.After I wrote my comments in the wired version, a few folks wrote in their review that I didn't know what I was talking about.Well, I'm a computer expert, I've tried every avenue to make this dang thing work right but no matter what I do there is no feedback for EA Sports Madden 2005 even though this game is featured on the Logitech Rumblepad box! The rumble works for EA Sports Need for Speed but not for Madden 2003 or 2005.The only conclusion I can come to is this thing is still experimental and not ready for release.I've sought help from Logitech, EA Sports, Microsoft, on-line forums, updated drivers, tried clean boots, reinstallations galore.Hours and hours later, still not working right. No more Logitech for me. Maybe no EA Sports either. I don't need the aggravation."
5,Best one I've owned,"I've owned a few of these handheld controllers and this Logitech seems to be the best. I had one from Walmart that literally fell apart in my hands, and I'm not rough on my computer equipment. Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 is built sturdy and can take a LOT of use. I highly recommend it. As a matter of fact, I'm buying a second one for my laptop."
4,GReat controller,"Pros: Works great, easy installation, like the design ,has study feel to itCOns: Feels kind of heaver than PS2 controller most cause of the batteries, runs off batteries which means you have to replace every time they run outFirst logitech controller to buy and love itHad it for a month and using it for GTA:San Andreas Works great"
2,Logitech Rumbledpad 2,"I installed this controller on my windows 7 64bit home premier system. Download the latest driver from logitech. Installation was easy. The control worked with GRID game, but the vibration does not work with this game. Got the Microsoft xbox 360 wireless controller for pc and everything work with GRID game."
3,perfecto...hasta que sin explicacion se daña (great...until fail!),"buen peso, se puede mejorar el consumo de bateria, pero lo inperdonable es que sin explicacion alguna el pad analogico se descalibró y no hay herramienta, ni soft ni hard que lo arregle....good weith, battery duration a deception.analogue pad un-fixed calibration"
4,Solid controllers,"Kids love these controllers (we have 2). They have held up well to dropping and roughness. Batteries last, only issue has been periodically reconnecting them with their wireless receiver. This never takes more than holding the receiver button and signalling from the controller you want to reconnect."
1,???????????????,"Why is this product 110$, is this a mistake, or is this for real. I also recently purchased a Windows Xbox 360 controller, is it compatible with a lot of games? Please comment. Thanks"
2,Old and used Stock may not work,"I originally ordered one from a ""Like New"" dealer through Amazon.USB Remote Receiver worked OK; Control Unit lit up on the indicator, but had no output to the Receiver.Believing I was doing something wrong and failing to determine what, I ordered a ""New"" Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 with Vibration Feedback (Black) from a different dealer and it works great.I must say, Amazon is doing its best to arrange a return and refund for the original purchase.Don't know whether or not the ""Dealer"" will cooperate...............still waiting after four weeks.Be careful folks."
3,"High Price, Low Quality","I bought this gamepad for use with my Mac. It looks cool, and it has all the buttons you would need, but some aren't compatible, and the thing doesn't rumble! I was actually disappointed with this."
3,Sometimes it's great,"This is a good controller, but it does have it downs.Try not to use the rumble settings, as the controller uses up battery power quickly.Not every PC video game is compatible with this controller. But I have lots of games and I tend to try video games others won't, so that may not be a problem for others.The wireless is the greatest part about this item. You can get in to the game and just enjoy it."
4,Awesome..,"This controller is almost perfect.It has great build quality so it doesn't feel cheap. It also has a nice shape to it: very comfortable to hold. And the software that comes with it is very robust.You're given so many customizeable options..- Deadzone: allows you to choose how far to move the stick back before your character moves&- Sensitivityare just some options given to you to tune the controller to your liking.Very, very, customizeable.And it's wireless! Meaning no tangled cords. Its performance by the way is very, very, good. I've noticed no lag whatsoever.One imperfection though are the #9 & #10 button placements. These are the top middle buttons that are unfortunately, placed above the 'mode' and vibration buttons. They should be BELOW these nonplayeable buttons so they could be more reachable.But hey..I guess no product is perfect.I give it 4/5. Would have been a 5 if button placements were more spot on. Nevertheless, a very solid effort that's worth the money. Logitech did good."
3,Works well while it lasts,"I don't know why Logitech controllers seem to work very well and then they seem to get permanently out of calibration. My rumblepad 2 was incredible to use while it lasted. I let it sit for a while without use, then booted up FIFA only to find that the left analog stick wouldn't work. When I push it forward it registers as forward at first, then bounces down and doesn't work. The rest of the controller works, but not matter how many times I calibrate it, it never realizes the full range of the left stick, and when I push it to its full range, it thinks I'm barely pushing it up or I'm not pushing it at all. I don't know if I got a lemon or not, but I am very disappointed with it failing like that."
3,Not for Windows 7,"I bought this, and Logitech web site says it's not supported in Windows 7. I couldn't make it work either. Now it's a doorstop."
5,perfect,"have played pc games for years and for whatever reason never bought a game padit was a mistake not to, this thing is perfect. totally responsive, no delay, comfortable, and more than affordable."
4,Solid Product - only one minor issue,"I've had this controller for nearly a year now. It has worked very well with both racing and flight sim games. It is well built and actually feels more solid in my hands than do most game console controllers. Batteries last months, even with heavy use. The only reason not to have all five stars is because I had a small but easily overcome problem with it yesterday. I went to use my controller after a few weeks sitting idol and it would not connect to the computer. Restarts, calibration, etc. all failed. After a little internet research I found the answer. The key is to remove one battery, press the button on the front of the receiver then press buttons 5 & 7 while reinserting the battery. Apparently this resets all the communications and after doing so I'm back in business. I like this controller a lot and enjoy the freedom the wireless allows. If you want to connect more than one - read up on it to save some frustration. I can be done but requires two receivers."
3,Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2,"I like the convenience of the cordless gamepad, but this comes at a price. The Rumblepad 2 will consume batteries (2xAA), therefore I recommend the long life, camera type batteries for max life. The USB receiver should have an option for external power because it will draw up to 100ma from the USB port it is plugged into, and this could cause problems with other devices on the same hub. This is a well built unit, but unless you really need a cordless gamepad, I suggest a wired unit."
1,Does not work with all games,This did not work with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 so I sent it back.
1,Not compatible with Mac,"I purchased this controller with high hopes that it would allow me to play games on my Mac with an conventional game controller. It's listed as Mac compatible, but I have yet to find a way to make it work. I've contacted Logitech, and the tech I spoke to said it should work with any game that supported it, but not has not been my experience. After purchasing, I went online and have found that no one has been able to get it to work. There is software that claims to help, but I tried it, with no luck. Too bad, the gamepad itself has a very nice feel to it, and seems to be well made."
4,Learn it and you would like it!,"Just like many reviewers, vibration doesn't work for me, but who cares, that does nothing except burning the battery faster. The shape and design is ideal for man hands and it functions well just like PS2 controllers. I can't really judge battery life since I just had it not too long ago. User guide are always confusing, I haven't read it, no exception in this case. Range is good with no lack experience so for. The minus 1 start was because it is hard to get all the keys to function correctly. It took me a long time configuring it again and again to get keys rights(that's for 1 game only), but the latest driver fix my problem because it can map ""key strokes"" to the programmable keys on the control, but it take some time to figure that out. You would see!After all, I would still recommend it because everything else is great. It's hard to use, but it serve my purpose, what else would I expect for $30."
1,A nightmare for Mac -- Can't use with Portal/Portal 2,"I bought this controller specifically so I could play Portal 2 on my Mac. Turns out it isn't fully compatible with Macintosh, even though the advertising says it is. First of all, the enclosed software disc is PC only, and there's no configuration software included. Also, mini CDs won't run in iMacs.After spending hours researching this product and trying to figure out how to use it on a Mac, I gave up. This controller is a bad deal for Mac users."
2,Not actually Mac compatible.,"Logitech and Amazon both list this as Mac compatible. It's not. Logitech offers no Mac drivers/software for this device. With some tinkering I was able to get Leopard to recognize a couple button-presses, but there's no way to map the buttons and game-support is dismal at best. There are a few third-party programs you can purchase as a work-around to this, but this item should not be billed as ""Mac compatible"" by any means."
5,Lots of playing time,"I have played a lot with it and it works perfectly, although if you intend to bring it to Costa Rica, in customs they will charge you 47% in taxes, so it is not a very good idea to do that."
1,Not compatible with OS X,"I'm a Mac user and I ordered the Rumblepad 2 thinking it would be cross-platform, but it's not. Received it in the mail today and now that I have the item in front of me, I see on the packaging that it only works with Windows. Why can't Amazon put that in the product description, so I don't have to waste my time sending this thing back???"
3,"good joystick, but hard to program","its good joystick, but some buttoms not working in some games and can't program them"
5,"Great hardware, but careful with bundled games","Used the gamepad with Sierra's ""Grand Prix Legends"" and it works flawlessly - neutral calibration, responsive controls, and the analog sticks feel solid.The only qualms I have is that Sierra bundled a shareware game, Reiner Knizia's Samurai, without labeling it as such. Nowhere during the installation process did it warn the user that the game is only playable 10 times. The game is discontinued so you'd have to find an existing registration somewhere, but even after registering, reinstalling the game shows that it still remembers the old play count, so it must have stored a hidden file somewhere on the hard drive.Conclusion: install the drivers, but check each game before installing, don't assume they are special-edition versions like normally ship with graphics cards."
3,Good Looking Pad But...,I'm sure this is a great pad but the installation is crazy. I tried installing using the software and it said it could not detect a device. Then when i tried to install using Windows it said it could not install it. This is a real disappointment. I'm sure its a great control but how do I get it work?
1,wing type controllers worthless art racing games,"Anyone with real experience racing vehicles will tell you quickly that only steering wheel controllers of the integrated types such as Logitech's G25 are the only worthwhile controller. An accelerator, brake, and steering wheel set is the bare minimum.F1 2002, Indianapolis 500 and such games require at least the minimum. And last but not least, make sure the controller works with your chosen game. Only Logitech posts such. The others are unknowledgeable, probably by intent."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of the entire Biblical ""Joseph"" story and so I was eager to get this book. It is a fast read but unfortunately a disappointing one. There are many awkward phrasings throughout the book that took me a second to understand. While the character of Joseph is nicely cocky in the beginning, such little time is actually spent on his journey to Egypt, his slavery to Potiphar, and his time in prison that it is difficult to understand and empathize with the emotional and psychological changes he shows. Likewise the relationships Joseph develops with Egyptians, especially those he would be close to such as his master and his wife, are treated rather briefly and in his wife's case a bit sexistly. Overall I was very disappointed."
1,Neither Cardio nor Tribal,"Only buy this DVD if you have no access to real Tribal belly dance teachers or if you live someplace where finding physical fitness and/or Tribal bellydance classes do not exist.This is an OK DVD for women who have no outlet to exercise. The cover art is great, the name of the DVD is interesting, but the quality does not hold up to the promise. For couch potatoes only!"
3,Four Seasons in the Seventies,"I think that when the Genuine Imitation Life Gazette was released in 1969, songwriter Bob Gaudio was given a license to explore more emotional, heartfelt music. They had, in a way, ""grown up."" This is what we got from the Four Seasons during the 1970s.Even though they had such personal music during this time, I still prefer the straight, happy pop stuff that they released during the 1960s. Don't get me wrong, the Seasons will always be great; and during the 70s they were not better, but different."
4,great cd,I love both of these albums. I had them both as albums but didn't think that they would come out on cd. Thankfully I was wrong. Any 4 season fan should get these cds
2,Typical razor blade scraper...,"Stanley 28-500 Razor Blade ScraperTwo bucks is about all this tool is worth. It works, but the blade extension mechanism is fair at best and sometimes gets stuck, especially as the tool gets dirty. There isn't anything about this tool that distinguishes it from all the other cheap razor scrapers on the market. My advice is to buy a scraper locally and avoid shipping charges."
2,Nice but old,"The CD is a bit sad and angry (also old I think), Cypress Hill lose their humour following the east coast - west coast deal, probably forgetting that their best quality is the fun that they transmit. I'm waiting for their new album, hoping that the sounds will be as in the past."
3,Production Is Ill,"Well, Muggs gives you what you expect, dope production. However the same can't be said for the guest lyricists. Other than Xzibit, Kool G Rap, King Tee, Ras Kass, and Dilated Peoples, the list is a joke. Don't fool yourself saying that they're good. Nonetheless, the beats are ill which is why you're interested in the album isn't it? It should be. While it's silly to call this a classic, it is a solid album."
4,Soul Assassins,"Soul Assassins 2 is one of the best albums of the year. Each song is impressive with dark beats and ill emcees. The grizant said the production on You Better Believe It isn't good but its an ill beat - something like its off an old gangster film which compliments Xzibit and King Tee's lyrics in the song. Both the Kurupt songs are dope with his raw lyrics. The production from Muggs and the Alchemist is consistent throughout the album.In my opinion, the first two tracks are the worst, Everlast's lyrics aren't up to much but his flow is nice and the Self Scientific is a good song to end with, not counting the bonus tracks. The Cypress Hill song is better than the ones I've heard off their album, its more like one off Temples Of Boom or IV.The most outstanding songs from the album are Gza's When The Fat Lady Sings, Kurupt and Roscoe's When The Pain Inflict, Dilated People's Suckers Are Hidin', and Cypress Hill's Don't Trip."
4,DJ MUGGS IS THE 1 OF THE GREATEST,I love DJ Muggs' beats. I lost this cd and had to buy it again because there is 5 or 6 songs with sic azz beats. Track 1 Kool G Rap song is ridiculous. KGR is so underrated.
3,JUST ANOTHER ONE?,"It is a good film and doesn't make too many biblical mistakes, but it just doesn't have the top notch actors it takes to tell a story of the life of Jesus. It is a tough job that countless filmmakers have been trying to perfect for years. I have a pretty good collection of biblical type videos and DVDs, so this just adds to the group. My favorite is still Franco Zefferelli's TV mini-series one, which is on three videos."
4,North Punch,"This movie is genuinely disturbing.There is no manicheism : the beginning shows us that a racist boy can have feelings towards a boy who has got AIDS, how the boredom of poor areas can turn people into criminals ( cf the raping scene, the killing of an arabian ). It refuses the happy end : the arabian guy dies because of the jealousy of the boyfriend of the girl he flirted with. Lots of french critics have criticized the final redemption. But this end is reminiscent of the redemption of the bad lieutenant and Bresson's Pickpocket : how horrible and disgusting your sins might be, you may have god's pardon if you suffer enough to get it. This movie might not be friendly but it is as radical as Ferrara or Cronenberg and it obsesses the viewer a long time after he's seen it."
4,This is an OK DVD -,"Not bad, some interesting points I would not have come up with, TBN produced this in 1996. Many people worked on this film. Sound is excellent, wardrobe is great, location is fantastic, but still lacked a real professional zeal. Special effects were not the best. Story line is biblical and follows God's Word very well. Enjoy, but there are better one's out there."
3,easy read book,Grandaughter. age 5 ..in kindegarten can read it. enjoyed it so so...but nice pics..A bit expensive for what it is...but nice.
4,wjat I feel,this book was okay I thought it was a little better than most of the other treasury of classics for children. I think this book would be pretty good for little children that think they are verry little and are dont really think of thamself really like they are verry emportant even thought every child is loved and emportant. Overall it is probaly a good book for pretty young children. I liked it for a little bet wen I was pretty small. It is a pretty nice book for little children
2,Cheap smell,"Certainly not in the Hugo Boss, Armani, CK perfume class. I put perfumes in classes based on the scent smell not necessarily the name. This is in the B class. I am not impressed with it. I use light perfumes, its decently light but stays till the next day, so the staying power is good, but it just doesn't have a classy smell. If you like the CKone, D&G light Blue you may not like this."
1,Smells Like An 89 Year Old Man,"I was looking forward to buying and using this product. I have only used three colognes my whole life. Chikara (INCREDIBLE COLOGNE but TO PRICEY and SMALL BOTTLE), Mambo By Liz Claibourne (DECENT COLOGNE but NOTHING SPECIAL has a GOOD PRICE though), and this one(WENT STRAIGHT TO THE TRASH AFTER SECOND USE). When I first opened it I immediately thought it smelt horrible like a cheap cologne you can find in a thrift shop or flea market! Then I thought I would get some other opinions. Maybe I was wrong? Asked some girls I know and Not one person liked it and all said the same thing... It smells like an old man."
2,cologne for the seniors....seriously...,"This cologne is for SENIOR Citizen dudes.It smelled old,like a pomade,nothing special except its a good cologne for the OLDIES.that's all.So NO i dont recommend this to younger generations unless you wanna smell like your pops and would wanna attract senior ladies as well.."
4,Musky,"Smells a great deal like Stetson, or to a lesser degree some of the muskier Dunhill colognes. Strong concentrated scent is definitely a single squirt application for most. Very deep aroma, not light or citric but a hearty smell."
1,I am surprised with all these comments but not with the cologne..,"ok, I bought this cologne because of all these nice comments, I dont kno what to say.. I am not sure if all these are scam or what. because, I still have the cologne, I havent seen any attraction from female body while using it, the smell doesnt last long, and it is too sweet. almost girlish!, and i am not a bad looking guy either, so i dont kno, at first I felt like a rip off, but now i am like ya watteva, its just $20... so yea.. I was really disappointed!"
2,Too Sweet!!!!!,I am sorry but I beg to differ with the other reviews.......this is so sweet I thought my Gramma had come in the door. A perfect ladies fragrance.....Sorry
1,K ROD,"I THINK THE WHOLE GROUP OF MARKETING AGREED TO WRITE GOOD COMMENTS ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND THE MITH ABOUT PHEROMONES, PEOPLE ! JUST DONT BUY THE PRODUCT, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. i AM NOT SAYING THAT SMELL BAD, IT IS JUST A SYMPLE CHEAP COLOGNE WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUPID MONEY HUNTERS THAN MAKE SUCH STORY ABOUT PHEROMONES AND ATRACTION. IT DOES NOT WORK. TRUST ME OR WASTE TIME AND MONEY AND THEN WRITE A COMMENT LIKE ME. BUT DO IT."
1,"Don't waste your money, unless you want to smell like an old lady.","I realize to some people its kind of silly to purchase cologne online. But honestly, I've purchased several different ones based on reviews and been very happy. This is one of this worst colognes I've ever smelled. I asked my wife what she thought and she laughed in my face and said I smell like a old lady. She ended up giving it to her mom, who must have some issues with her nose. be warned this stuff is strong and the smell does not come off even after washing with soap. I don't understand all the favorable reviews... total waste of money, will not be buying this again."
1,Smells like a cleaner,"Smells like a cleaner, and as for the pheremones, women I know have asked me why I changed my cologne, since they liked the other one better."
1,GROSS & MISREPRESENTED!! DON'T BUY!,"If I could give zero stars, I would! This stuff smells like an old man cologne and it's STRONG! Really gross stuff, I'd stay away from this and DONT BELIEVE THE DESCRIPTION! If your old and are around people that expect you to smell like the old insurance salesman in the back office then buy it, if not then dont.....you will not be picking up any hotties at the club with this stuff on!"
2,Another disappointing fragrance purchase!,"This bottle of Realm does not smell right! It is not the same Realm that we know and love! Is there a different manufacturer or formulation? Again, this fragrance, like the Tuscany Per Uomo, does not seem authentic."
5,I LOVE IT,"I don't know if it works for all men, but as a woman I can tell you I love this cologne on men. It is attracting and appealing to me. It really does linger too. Love it!"
2,Loses potency in the bottle,"I've had a bottle of 3.4 ounce Realm for less than a year, and it's flat. it was great for about 6 months."
5,Lucky Purchase,"I bought this Cologne a few days ago without even smelling it first. I have another type of cologne with pheromones and took a chance on this one. All in all, I have to say that I am happy with my purchase."
4,For you to pass the exams.,"Like many other Exam study guide. It was never meant to be a comprehensive VB programmer's guide. Its a study guide (with couple typos) and does the job it was written for. That is to pass the exams. If you want in depth meterial then buy the MSDN CDs and the Mastering Series from Microsoft. You will pass the exams with this book. Chapters 8 I thought was extremly good even better than how Microsoft press handled ADO (command and connection). If you are looking for a programmer guide, this is not the book for you. However if you want to pass the exam, give it try."
4,"Not perfect, but will do the job.","I did find errors in the book, BUT they do not make this a bad book. Most of the errors are identified on the Syngress website. I have found that the material presented in the text is strong, accurate and concise. I've passed the exam and attribute a great part of my passing to this book."
1,Nothing good to say...,"There is no structure to the material. Topics are not logically grouped together, instead they are broken up. The book goes into great detail on the fundamental, obvious stuff, but is so vague on complex areas where it really matters.The book tries to teach the technical material in a flamboyant manner , but in doing so makes the topics difficult to understand. There is a lot of unnecessary and sarcastic humour which just wastes time and paper and is annoying to read. The grammar is difficult to read and very often ambiguous and misleading.There are far too many errors and typos. There is a Web page that shows a long list of errors, but it is far from complete."
2,I'd keep looking...,"If you throw the CD away, the book may help you pass the test. Do not use the CD at all! You will be wasting your time memorizing menus and Microsoft doesn't expect you to do this to pass the exam. There is a lot of useless information in the book as well. Use your money on a different book."
2,Book needs to be debugged!,"If you have experience with VB then this is an okay book, but it is quite obvious that this was a 'hurry to press' book. Some of the Self Test questions were never covered in the chapter to which they were asked and the answers to many questions are wrong. This book definitely proves that you must have experience to pass the test, because this book alone will not do!"
5,Covers all you need to pass the exam!,"Broad coverage of everything I found on the exam. Desktop is not asn easy test, and this book refreshed many topics that I hadn't touched for awhile. Well worth the $40."
3,"Good content, a few errors.","Although this book covers all the ground it should (MS Objectives), it does suffer from a few inaccuracies, including questions and examples, although not as bad as some may make you think. This book could have been better edited, if someone actually tried out the questions and examples, they would clearly see that there are some mistakes with a few of them. Another point I'd like to make is that the electronic version of the book is not as accurate as the printed version (was this a beta?). On the other hand they did produce the first VB 6.0 comprehensive exam guide, which helped me get a head start. Despite the few problems this is still a good book, and an errata on the publishers web site would have raised my rating to 4 stars. Since this was the first book out on the subject, I purchased it. I have been fairly satisfied with this book"
3,The book is OK.,"I haven't gone through the whole book yet, but it isn't as bad as some of the people are saying. There are a few problems with some of the questions, I think it has to do with editing. Also one of the labs I went through on the ADO Data control had a couple of mistakes, but the material you need for the exam is in there. Having written the beta with only Microsoft courseware it was nice to see a book that can help pass the certification exam.As for the size of the book there is only just over 500 pages you actually need to read. As of now there might be a better choice since sybex now has a book out for this exam"
4,Well Done!,This book has been an asset in my studying. Lots of challenging practice questions to help one ready themselves for the actual exam. Very comprehensive through and through.
2,Was this book edited?!??!,"There are too many incorrect answers within the self-tests and it is just way overwinded. Find some other book, I wish I never invested in this book in the first place."
1,When will publishers learn to quality test these books?,"Real problems with the questions. Most were wrong in the first chapter and many were wrong, poorly worded or confusing in the following chapters. The first few chapters cover in great detail the basics of VB. The following chapters cover the newer aspects of VB 6 but in such general terms that it is impossible to have confidence that you have really learned the new concepts. Finally the questions at the end of the advanced chapters ask for answers not even covered in the chapter.I can not recommend this book. but it is the first so what can you do if you want to stay ahead of the certification curve?Are there no publishers that can beta test their books before releasing them? And shame on Microsoft for certifying that ""the course contains accurate product information""!!"
4,Use it with other sources,"I just passed my exam yesterday, in large part due to this book. I used it first in my studies to get a good overview of the exam subject areas. Then I used other sources (Exam Cram, New Riders) to get a deeper exposure to the material.The sample exam questions are easier than the actual exam, so don't get too carried away with high practice scores.If you buy it, be sure and go straight to the Syngress web site They have posted the corrections to the text. Good luck."
1,Pathetic excuse for a study guide.,"Don't buy it - 'nuff said. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this book. Since you are - Don't. Errors, incomplete, and inadequate."
2,Not too good!,I bought this book because it was the first available and am sorry I didn't wait around for some of the others. It is full of errors and the test questions are disapointing. This is not a book that I'd recommend to anyone.
1,This book is not worth even the paper it is printed on,"I bought this book a few weeks ago to help me prepare for the Microsoft 70-176 exam. From cover to cover it only contained irrelevant information, long descriptions of the EDI and nothing else. The questions contained in the book and accompanying CD are not worth reading. It's a shame to publish such book."
3,Chapter 3 errors,"Found few errors in Chapter 3 examples Started to dislike the book on chapter 3, found 3 errors."
1,70-80 per cent of the book is junk,"This book was written by many people, and it shows. Some chapters are really scary, especially in the beginning. Whoever wrote them seems to have no idea. Some other parts are perhaps OK but then again maybe it is because I know less about those things and cannot judge well."
3,The test is buggy but overall its not a bad study guide.,"I used this book and the Microsoft training CD to study for the test. I passed the test. The practice test on the CD with the book has many errors. But it was a good review for the test. The book does not follow all of Microsofts praticies. The book did not cover everything that was on the real test. I wish the book covered everything on the Microsoft training CD. However, I think this book will help anyone studying for the test provided they also have other study material."
1,Too many mistakes in the book,"There are simply too many mistakes in the self tests questions and answers. If your purpose is to prepare yourself to take the exam, this is a wrong book to read.David Li"
5,Excellent Book!,"I think this book, alone is more than enough to get you through the exam and serves as a comprehensive guide to exploiting VB to the fullest."
2,"Filled with errors, but one or two useful tips... somewhere","Don't get me wrong, I don't recommend this book for studying for the exam. I haven't taken the exam yet, but I do not recommend this book for studying. On the other hand, if you can expense it to your company, it does have a clever tip or two buried in there, and was written in a way that I could make use of common tips (i.e. things you should get out of other books, but are so buried in those other books you miss them). There are errors in the questions/answers section, but you will find that everywhere, and you should be smart enough to realize why they are errors. I would say the more errors you can legitimately find, the better prepped you are for the exam..."
1,Worst book ever,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. There are so many errors, the book is useless. The practice exams are wrong and some of the content in the book is wrong. This will make you do worse on the exam if you use it!"
1,Horrible,If a zero rating were possible....Embarrassing. I signed up for the exam early. I had to cancel. I was embarrassed.I depended on the fact that this book would be my key to passing the exam.There are multiple errors that are not even covered on the seven pages of corrections listed on the publisher's web site.I can't believe the publisher allowed this book to go to press with this many errors.Definitely a waste of money.
2,"Terrible Editing, Unorganized, Good Luck on Exam!","This book actually refers to ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) as ""Access Data Objects"" in several sections! Do NOT use as a study guide!"
3,Good Book But...,"The book is good. There are errors but that made me more critical and analytical on what I was reading. It helped me a lot especially when I took the test.I do hope that the authors of this book realize that they have responsibilities to their customers. Although they have posted some corrections on their website, it is not enough. They should be extra careful next time because people are spending their hard earned money on their products and they expect that the product is worth it."
1,I would pick 0 stars if I could!,"I wish I had read these online reviews before I purchased this book. I plan on returning it and looking for something better. Anything would be better. I just finished chapter 1, and found many editing errors. These errors are so bad, that the reader will choose incorrect answers on the self test portions. This is no way to prepare for such and important exam."
1,Everything you need to prepare for - and become - frustrated,"The book appeared to have been rushed, as I often found myself coming across grammatical errors, typos, incorrect self-test answers, inconsistent information, and most annoying of all - exercises that were erroneous and/or lacking required code for executing.I gave up on the book after the 6th chapter. Basically, I didn't feel confident that I could trust the book content, and being the type of person who learns by example, I needed exercises that worked. Wasting time trying to debug code from the book just isn't acceptable.Rushing a book of this nature to the shelves does have its advantages; however, in the long run, it's only creating bad business. I would look elsewhere for MCSD study material."
1,Too many errors to be useful.,I gave up after 2 chapters. What is the value of a book with so much incorrect information and so many typos?
1,It's a waste of money,You can't depend on there Exam Simulation. Some of the answers on their questions on the book and on the CD-ROM are not the same. How can you pass the exam if the book you're reading doesn't even know what's wrong or right.
2,Hard work.,"I agree with the reviewer who wondered how anyone could give this book 5 stars unless they had a financial interest in it. The book is very hard work. Topics are presented all out of proportion: that is, important topics are glossed over while trivial topics get page space. The book definitely appears padded just to make it look like a big, useful book. Material is repeated, while meaningless sidebars appear as if the editor was thinking, ""time for a sidebar"". Many topics are explained in mind-boggling ways that make them seem impossibly difficult, when a little diagram would have made them seem easy. Even for someone inexperienced with VB, it is obvious to me that there are stupid errors in examples and in self tests. The whole thing has been thrown together in a hurry to make a buck. I have no option but to plough through this thing now to pass my exam, but hell, I resent it."
1,The worst MCSD Exam book ever made?,Who was the loser who decided to put the practice exam in browser-based format??Absolutely nothing new from the book!
4,A Decent Desktop Study Guide,"This study guide has been extremely helpful in my studying. Yes, there are a few errors, but most study guides I've seen have some. There's also an errata site that Syngress has that lists them. The book seems to map extremely well to the exam objectives, which was a definite plus. It's challenging, so someone new to programming may have difficulty, but I think it will certainly help me in passing."
2,Vey disappointed. But dont have much choice.,This book has numerous errors and contradicts other study guides I was using. The real test was in a completey different league than the practice I had in any of my study guides. Somebody needs to write a good study guide. Unfortunately when you notice mistakes the book becomes useless.
2,Useless tests,"The information in the book is generally pretty good, but the practice tests have so many wrong answers that it makes the tests pretty much useless. Since there are so many better resources for preparing for the exam, I'd stick with just about any of the others and put this one at the bottom of the ""to buy"" list."
2,Do not buy it if you are a beginner,"If this is the first time you are learing about VB, don't buy this book. The text, the code and the review questions are riddled with errors. I don't think they used an editor during the writing process because some of the text is confusion and wordy. If you buy this book use a seperate book to practice code. DO NOT USE THE CODE IN THIS BOOK TO STUDY."
3,Okay but carefully read it.,The book is fine and easy to read but you will find errors on it. The good thing about it is that it does provide an on-line service to point you to the errors on this book. The exams are also updated from the book. They do respond very quickly. I am pleased with this book but I would also study on the Transends exam and the Mastering Series VB6 CD.
2,The Material has Too Many Errors!!!,"I have never seen so many errors in one title in my life. Whoever edited this book (if anyone did) is in the wrong line of work. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that it does have a great deal of information. You must verify *EVERYTHING* to be comfortable it is correct. Maybe that is how the Author wants us to learn the material. <grin> It worked for me, I Aced the test!!! (it wasn't the only material I studied either) Pick at least 2 titles and use the MSDN."
2,Better than nothing.,"The contents of the book do, in fact, map to the information on the test, except for a few huge, glaring omissions (Debug.assert? What's that?). The mistakes in the self test are especially frustrating when trying to do that one-last-review before the exam. The exam tends to focus on COM a lot, which the book fails to address really well. At the same time, the exam has a lot of installation and distribution questions that the book was good preparation for. A second edition of this book, with all the errors fixed, might be worth buying. n.b. I did pass the exam on this book alone, so it can't be that bad."
1,This is the WORST book I've ever seen,I'm giving up after one chapter. Most of the 20 questions at the end of the first chapter were badly written - half of the answers given were wrong. Who was the proofreader for this book?!
2,I think someone rushed it to be the first VB 6 exam guide.,"Questions and answers are poorly worded. It seems that they took some of the paragraphs from the VB5 exam guide. For instance it states that that to load controls at runtime, you must use a control array. Microsoft states one of the exam objectives is loading controls at runtime, and I'm sure they would like to see control.add as an option since they added it in VB6. But it is the first on the market, so while it won't be my only resource, it's a start."
2,I'll never buy another book before reading the reviews,The technical material is fairly good but the errors prevalent in the sample exams will have you pretty confused by exam day.
2,This book is rife with errors.,"There are errors in at least (8) of the (13) chapters in this book. I suspect the publishers rushed this study guide to print.I used this book to prepare for the 70-176 exam and other than the mistakes mentioned, found it lacking. Although the book's format is very readable and the information it contains provides a good base for learning VB 6.0, the book fails to meet it's objective. I used this book, and Visual Basic 6.0 as my main guide for preparation. When I took the test I found that the exam required a level of knowledge of MS SQL Server 7.0 that is beyond what this book delivers.Unfortunately there appears to be no alternative to this book. It appears to be the only game in town, for now."
1,A challence,"If your gold is to take over other peoples source code and error correct it, this book will be a good practise. There are errors in almost every source code example, which is very confusing when you think you're starting to understand what they're talking about. Would it be that hard to compile the source code before putting it in the book?"
3,VIBRATES A LOT!!!!,"I'm just a beginner but I started using this racquet and I noticed it seemed like it was vibrating every time I hit the ball. At first I thought my grip was wrong and it was just loose in my hand but then I checked it out online and it seems like that with all the pluses this racquet has (and I found it for a great deal at the after-thanksgiving sale for $79.99 now they have it for $120), the main complain was about it vibrating. It bothered me a lot so I'm going to try a different racquet."
4,Great Ska Compilation,"By far one of the best Ska comps I've heard. Some of the standout tracks for me were Dr. Ring Ding's ""Shame & Scandal"", Hepcat's cover of Eric Morris' original track ""Penny Reel"" and the classic ""King of Kings"" by Prince Buster. Highly Recommended. A++"
1,Don't waste time or money,"I work with computers for a living, so after ""Norton Internet Security 2003 Professional Edition"" brought my computer to a grind, I was able to restore it to the pre-installation state. Others may not be so lucky.First, if you have a router, you don't need Norton firewall, your router is the firewall. To verify for yourself, search for phrase ""Symantech security check"" in Google and run their program to validate.Second, if you do need a software firewall, stay away from this product - it will only cause you grief and eventually you'll have to deinstall it to get any work done.If you still decide to get it, try to get it for free to save on amount of frustration when you start using it."
1,Made the mistake,"I purchased NIS 2003 to replace an installed version of NIS 2001. Big mistake! Would not write over it. NO customer support the only respone I got was ""strange error codes "" go to the online help problem respone pages and see if those errors are listed. I should have went there first NUMEROUS complaints similar to mine, would not load and many users were dead in the water they could not get back online! Long and short of it yesterday I recieved a refund check...no questions asked! What does that tell you!"
3,Fine Potential,"On my way out of L'Habana a few days ago, I caught a cab at 4:30 am from the Parque Centrale to Jose Marti Int'l Airport when suddenly the cabbie's cassette player began to thump this heady rap. I was completely enthralled. On learning that I'm Nigerian, the driver sped me forward to Cantos para Elewa and Cantos, certainly, is the finest cut on this really fine album by one of Cuba's leading young acts. I don't speak Spanish, so, maybe 537 Cuba will do something for those who understand it. It just reminds me of the Buena Vista Social Crap. I think that Orishas are in their finest form when they side-track speakeasy guitar [which any trio in any of L'Habana's million restaurants can furnish you any given evening of the year], tack down to bare percussion and speed-drag their delivery. Searing."
5,"Orishas celebrate Cuba with beautiful mix of sounds, beats","This is a masterpiece. The Orishas have mastered the technique of the hiphop idiom while melding the best of Cuban musical traditions to make a unique and unforgettable CD. Rejecting the racist and violent character of much of US hiphop, these guys celebrate their communities, their families, their beliefs, and most importantly, their love for their homeland. Nurtured and celebrated in Cuba, they still had to go to France to cut this CD and access a world audience. Yet another reason to demand an end to the embargo..."
2,hmmmm,"well, i was hoping for some REAL information on the subject. i would think that anyone who buys this book would already know most of the stuff inside... i sure did so it didnt help me at all. maybe the millions of pages with links will be useful to me.the 10 step recap for the book is to create a company (no duh), get a business license, get a po box, get a business bank account, get a merchant account, get an internet merchant account, find a company to host your domain, buy a domain, create a website, and then stock your website with content!! hmmm! thanks, bro, i didnt already know that!!!!this book will be helpful to the person who has never used the internet, never built a webpage, and just heard from someone who heard from someone else that you can make TONS of money if your husband takes naked pictures of you in the kitchen."
2,Not very good,"This is a 36-page spiral bound booklet with 8 pages of links. I was hoping this would be a how to start an adult site book but it really isn't. The only people who might find this booklet a little useful are those who don't have any experience with the Internet. Most of the information here could easily be found on [the internet]... The areas it addresses are just vague common sense information. For example it refers you to your state's ""department of incorporation"" on how to form a company. I've checked a few of the links on their resources guide and I guess that's a little helpful but again doing a search on [the internet] for Adult web hosting or adult content would have generated the same links ... If you want a typed out link page I guess you would like this but for me it's not worth the [money], I paid for this booklet. Save your money do your own search."
2,Common Sense approach - With Resource,"This flimsy little work (60 pages) spends a lot of time going over COMMON SENSE details you would use to approach any project. They also spend a lot of time flogging an Adult Resource Guide they sell for [price]. They include this list of URLs in the back of the book.Almost of the of the details, thoughts and suggestions they make are easily found on the web on various ""Newbie"" websites and even some content/sponsor websites.I would not recommend this for anyone who has already started working on a site/sites. It would be OK for someone who is literally just starting on an idea. At the ""I wonder..."" stage."
3,The Best Review by the BEST Reviewer,I ordered this book a year ago and read it in all.It was definitely an entertaining read but as for giving you what you are looking for it falls short.I was straight back online and looking for another guide.
4,"Good street punk, less clockwork","This album has a cool mix of oi and street punk stylings to make for a pretty good album. I personally like the more clocky stuff better but that's me, definately worth the purchase though."
1,Very Bland,"Lower Class Brats are on PunkCore Records, which has some good bands, so long as they're fashionably punk (it's basically the #1 guideline for this label), but all this band is is fashion. This simply does not deliver. It's marketable, and... It's one monotonous song after the other, blending in to one extremely unmemorable record! Don't be tricked by fashion, the music isn't half as cool as those clothes. Maybe they'll do better next time, since I'm sure they'll put out another record just to put one out again. They're that kind of band."
5,Casio Exilim EX-S770 7.2MP Digital Camera,"Great camera! It's the smallest 7.2MP on the market. It's smaller than my wallet, I can carry it with me all the time, I get to use it a lot more. It's a fun camera, the picture quality is good. Unless you are a professional and take action shots or need a lot more zoom, this camera will serve every purpose. The size, again, is a major advantage, you don't have to walk around with a camera bag, so you don't look like a tourist, and can have it with you all the time.Shipping was quick, and the goods were in excellent condition."
4,Overall- Great Camera for Price,"The Casio Exilim EX-S770RD is a great camera for the price. Camera is the smallest on the market and will fit in any pocket. LCD Sreen is large and very clear. 7.2 MP produces great picture quality and the functions are easily accessed. As this is my first Casio purchase, I am very pleased with the quality."
2,memory card locked,"I recently purchased this camera. It takes great pictures;however, I turned it off one night and then when I turned it back on it said card locked. I can not get it to work now. I was wondering if anyone new how to fix that?"
1,Terrible quality - don't buy,"I purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a USB charging cradle that would not work. This is terrible, terrible quality control and I will never trust another casio product."
4,Built like a tank,"I brought the camera as a gift for the wife (per her wishlist) so I didn't know anything about the cam when I brought it....but now that I have it for awhile I love it.PROS:-Built like a tank (ie. I accidentally drop it from about 5 feet and it landed on gravel with rocks). The camera now has a big dent on it but still works great.-takes decent/normal video.-I came from a 3.2 Mpixel camera from this so the pictures blew me away. I liked the picture quality that I now use it instead of my DSLR when I want good pictures during informal events.-took the exilim on a tropical beach for vacation and the pictures that came out are beautiful. Turned me into a shutterbug during that trip...I was taking 100 to 300 shots per day...LOVE it!CONS:-make sure you have the cam's cradle to charge the camera!-flash sucks (but same goes to other point and shoot cameras) so, just try not to use the flash or just accept washout pics at night when using flash. Not a big issue for me!"
3,Disappointing Photo Quality,"I bought this camera because I had a great experience with my prior Casio, the EXP-700. That camera is still around and I've now gone back to it. Here's why: In spite of its very nice features, ease of use and compactness, the EX-S770 simply does not take good images. My guess is the tiny lens just can't do what it needs to. I have a fair amount of experience with digital cameras and this one has the worse image quality of any I've owned or used. It's very disappointing. I thought this would be the perfect camera to carry around in my pocket to take spontaneous pictures of whatever. That idea is out the window. Back to the old drawing board."
5,This is a great pocket camera,"I love this camera. Besides being extremely competent as a point and shoot camera, the size seals the deal. It can easily slide into almost any pocket.The camera has various Best Shot modes to add dramatic effect to your photos.The video is adequate but not great.My main complaint is that to charge the camera you must take the docking station. That is just one extra thing to haul on a trip.Works with my iMac with no extra software for photos. I had to install an included program to view the video however."
2,Okd for older technology,This was a decent ultra thin camera in its day. Technology has passed it by. Picture quality is marginal by today's standards.
4,Nice camera,"I've had this camera for a while and I'm still impressed with the quality of it. I like the big LCD display and find the menu very easy to use. The battery life could be a bit longer, and it would be nice if it powererd on a little quicker but other than that I like this camera. The photo quality is very good for a mid-range point and shoot camera. The colors come out vivid and crisp. And there are also quite a few settings that the user can adjust to get just the right picture. Overall, a nice starter camera."
5,I love it,"I have used this camera now for about a month and love it. I haven't gotten any pictures printed yet, but they look great on the computer. I love how small it is."
4,Always Jerry,"We can use more humoriists like Jerry Clower. Unlike many people today, Jerry always saw the same world I lived in. And he helped me realize just how lucky I was to be born in the South and to live away from major cities. God bless his soul."
3,It's okay....,"Watching Jerry is not as fun as listening to him. I didn't find this to be the best of his works by far, though perhaps still a good purchase if you're a die-hard Clower fan."
3,"Ok, but...",Good:1. Solid build2. Sharp Blade3. good feel in handsBad:1. Blad adjustment cumbersome2. hand screws not machined well and have trouble making minor changes evenly between blades.Overall:1. Worth its price2. Don't expect pro grade results over long haul
5,"Good, well-priced tool","First things first: when you buy an edged tool, you WILL have to hone the blade. Planes WILL need to be tuned. This one didn't need to be honed or tuned much, and was in working shape in about 20 minutes, about the average, in my experience, for decent woodworking tools. After that, it worked like a charm. The rounded, enameled handles are a little slick if your hands get sweaty, but this is a pretty minor flaw. The blade is excellent and holds its edge through several hours of shaping white oak staves, and the 2-screw blade leveling system, though it has more play in it than I usually like, is rock solid once you get it set. This is a tool that should give good service through at least 2 generations, all for under $20- pretty good deal if you ask me."
4,Good Once You Tune It,"I use this spokeshave to make canoe paddles. The blade has to be better sharpened though before you use it. I sharpened it to 2000 grit with a honing guide and then it worked great. The blade adjustment system works well, it has a screw adjuster on each side of the blade which allows you to get the blade exactly where you want it, then you lock it down; the lock down doesn't throw off the adjustment like some cheap block planes do."
3,Stanley Spoke Shave,I do not use a spoke shave very often but this on serves the purpose. The blade can use some additional sharpening before initial use.
5,I never had a spoke shave before and don't know how I got along without it.,Contrary to what I heve read the spoke shave came out of the box running. It was sharp and with a little adjusting it works great.
5,great spokeshave,"I don't know if I just got lucky but I'm totally happy with the one I got. The threaded posts are nice and straight (which is more than I can say about some other spokeshaves I've seen) and better still the iron was nice and flat, so it took me next to no time to hone the edge. Well done Stanley, I am impressed. Price is great too!"
4,wood shaving,"i'm not a pro at this but, i really like this tool.feels good in the hand.if you ajust the blade right just this tool."
4,Got Spokes to Shave?,"A nice little spoke shave plane, not quite the quality of the old nice ones from a time long gone but adequate for the task. Not a plane I use a whole lot but invaluable when the occasion presents itself.I am still looking for the guy what made off with grandpa's early 1900's planes and other tools, oh well, I will make do with the modern replacements even if they do take a bit of tuning up to get them up to snuff but once you get things flat and polished and honed you are good to go."
2,A Piece Of Cheap Crap!,"I don't know why so many people give this spokeshave so many high reviews. I got it to make a Vulcan harp, to get into those places where a sander or a block plane couldn't go-- yes, it cuts but even after grinding and tuning this spokeshave left nothing but chatter behind. I should have known a tool priced so cheap would also *be* so cheap."
3,Looking for a so-so spokeshave? This is your lucky day!,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. You won't be able to just open the package and go to work with this tool.I bought it for fairing a kayak I'm building. The first sign of a problem was the shavings piled-up between the blade and the base of the plane. This shouldn't happen on red cedar. The problem was worse with ash. Shavings would pack so hard I just put it down and used a small trim plane. The blade was shipped dull.I thought about sharpening it but found one of the nuts on the adjusting screws had a lot of play. I wasn't about to fiddle with something was doing at least part of the job I needed.Overall, it's doesn't cost much so I got what I paid for. If I need another spokeshave, I'll look around."
5,IT'S THE BEST!,"We got this version of Monopoly in Hawaii, and it is great! My sister and I like to play it when we have time, and it's much better than the real Monopoly, because the real Monopoly is too confusing. This one makes sense, and is easy to play. I mean, people of all ages can play it! It's awesome!"
4,my kids LOVE this game,my kids played this game with their cousins and love it so much that I had to find it. I could not find it in stores so thank goodness for Amazon!
5,great family game,My children love animals so this game was perfect!!! we love it. I would buy it again. just like the origanale game.
3,Disappointed,I bought this game as a gift and the game box came all squashed and I was very disappointed. Unfortunately it was too late to send it back to be replaced before Christmas .
4,Gift,"I gave this to my friend who is an animal lover and an aspiring zoologist as our ""fun"" Christmas gift. She loved it! All the pieces were included, and the cards even had fun animal facts on them. Their playing pieces are really cool looking too."
4,4 Stars,"Very good and very deep.I watched it dub and have no complaints, but there's the option to watch it sub and a few extras, mostly conceptual drawings and textless opening. There are no commentaries and no offical trailer. Scenes are spaced nicely with 8 scenes per episode. Each episode contains a device (short clip of a body part) and they are all included."
5,Steve Ressel go get a life. lain is #1,"Lain serial experiment is an awarded anime. it is fascinating and mysteriously ingenious. it is very in depth giving confusion and yet offering interest. any true otaku would know the greatness of Lain. This DVD is wonderful and is a must see. you may think Lain is boring and lifeless, but that is the point of her character. she is weary and drained only thinking of the Wired. gaps of silence are for effect towards those watchimg. i suggest this anime title to anyone. watch it twice if it is hard to grasp. it is wonderful KeyLain"
3,Flimsier than expected,"The button on the back came off when touched the first time. Of course, the garment looked better on the model than in real life. Still, if you get the right size, the garment can be attractive. Beware the restocking fee if you return the item, which was disappointing."
5,The perfect book for any skill level,"I love this book because it is written right at the best level for everyone to enjoy and get something out of. I read and practiced on my Canon AE-1, and shared things with a friend who began taking better pictures on his ""point and shoot"" camera. Terrific book, great photo examples...."
2,Must Disagree!,With a number of glowing recommendations already written about this book I hesitate to express my disappointment. This is a less than memorable effort. The writing style is wordy and covers no new ground. For a beginner this book should be useful but no more. The photos have sparse details as to technique and technical information.For a far better source try Campbell's Backpackers's Handbook. That book will challenge and inspire photographers of all level of ability.Each to his own.
4,Good Overview,"This is a good overview for beginning photographers. I would like to see an updated edition or web support that could give more detail. For example, showing photographs and highlighting what makes them work or not work.Still, I am looking forward to taking this with me when I hike."
4,Remember -- It is a Field Guide,"As a novice photographer I found this book useful. There are better, more complete books available. But it is important to remember that this is a field guide -- a book you can take along with you and use as a quick reference, something to inspire ideas and turn snap shots into something better. Personally, I have learned a lot from it, yet it is not the last book I will read on photography. If you are considering picking up a copy of it, I think it is worth it if you plan on reading it during a vacation or while away from home."
1,Clock too noisy,Clock looked like their old quiet model but was not. new model was too noisy to use at bedside
2,A disappointment,"I bought one of these clocks many years ago and liked it very much, which is why I bought some more. However, the current version of these clocks ticks very loudly. (The older version was totally soundless.) Other than the ticking, the clock is fine, but for me the loud ticket is a major negative."
5,This puts me in the inbetweens,"Ottawa's Kepler is so soft they've moved inside me. A beatifully delicate album that attempts to make music by avoiding excess. I like this philosophy and enjoy listening to this album when I need time to myself (which is always).A very scholarly album, with a philosophy of sound that will appeal to those who don't need to be taken over by the music, but who seek to follow along with it.Buy it...And they're a small-town band, so write them and ask them to come to your town. I saw them play last year and it was spell binding."
4,intense aural journey,"Unlike his bros' mixes Scott builds his beats instead of dropping them...this sort of trance is like nothing I've heard before and deserves some serious attention. Not at all a dancer, this aural journey goes straight to the brain instead of the feet with it's slow to steady beats and unexpected turns. Tracks from Lost Tribe and Future Sound of London add to an already intense cast. Seriously Check this one out...you wont be disappointed. (this one's continous)"
5,Great Hospital & Transport Tank,"I don't suggest this for long tern use, but when needing to transport or isolate your fish I just put each one in a tank and were good to go."
4,A nice wagon,"We recently purchased this wagon for our 21 month-old daughter. She likes riding in it. I do wish the wagon had a brake on it, though. That is my only regret."
5,This is a great wagon!,"I bought this wagon for my 2 year old twins. They love to open the gate and get in, put their sippy cups in the drink holders and go! The two bench seats(with storage underneath) are key, especially if you have two kids. It's made of durable plastic so they won't get hurt getting in and out like they might if it had those wooden sides some wagons have. The handle will tuck under the wagon for easy storage. I am very happy with this product."
3,Be weary of door,"We bought this wagon for our almost 2 year old and at first we loved it. We bought it for the storage and door, thought it would be easier and she would feel independant. She did love the door but it would NEVER stay closed, we tried everything. It would clsoe but as we walked work itself open, our daughter even fell out because it opened as we were walking. It is a great concept but just didn't work. We took this back and got the Pathfinder wagon instead!"
5,Satisfied with purchase,"I have a very tall 4 year old and an almost 2 year old. They were constantly fighting over foot room in the big Step 2 wagon. I broke down and bought this $[...] Radio Flyer Navigator wagon. After using it for a couple of months now, it was well worth the money. It is considerably bigger (wider seats, slightly more room for feet) plus a storage seat to boot. It is a much nicer ride (nicer wheels, longer handle, feels less likely to tip over even with sharp turns). I use this wagon to cart my kids everywhere, fromt the mall to the museums. Since this wagon holds up to 150lbs, I figure I'll get another couple of years out of it. Very much worth the money."
3,Safety belts,"My wife and I were under the impression that the wagon would have safety belts included, it did not. Our twin grand-kids are very active and can climb out at will. We returned it and will search for a better design for 17 month olds. The manufacturers would have done some good by adding the ""belts"". Educational, cheap, and wise."
2,Not bright enough - everything else ok,"Because of the size of the mirror, the light globe is not bright enough, especially in a sunlit room. I sent the mirror back and bought an almost identical mirror that had a few more watts in the light power (albeit more expensive)."
5,Lovely addition to the bathroom,"My mother saw one of these at a friend's home and expressed interest. Gotta make Mom happy!It was easy to install, so much so that deciding where to put it took longer than mounting it to the wall."
1,wrong info,"There is no cord as listed in the description! No easy install, unless you have electrician. NO way for me to install without creating hole in drywall to run wires. Very important detail that needs to be corrected in the item listing."
4,Birdee soak and cook food,really nice clean food cooks up well and can be frozen to be served as needed. Packaged well and ships fast. Will shop here again.
5,My Bird and I both love it.,He love it cause it tastes good and I love it cause I know he's getting the proper nutrition he needs.
5,Expensive and worth it,"Parrotlets love it, and some other birds will also eat it. My Java finches pick out their favorite bits. Easy to prepare (I use boiling water instead of the ""warm"" water specified by the directions) and any extra keeps for a couple of days in the fridge. I wish it weren't so expensive, but I haven't found anything that the birds enjoy quite so much except maybe sprouted seed, which is much more of an operation.I wish Volkman made a bigger bag with a lower unit price! I'd buy it."
1,Had to toss 9 out of 12 jars,Only three jars came in a form edible to babies. The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water. It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.
5,the only jarred baby food my son ate,"From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food. He was so picky. We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar. I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater. His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this. I highly recommend to try this baby food.Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well. My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best. Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too."
3,A little more watery than other 2nd foods for EB,"Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes. This one is more watery than the others, so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different, so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help."
5,Organic and tasty.,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the jars open easily. Great on the go snack."
3,Repeated deliveries of broken jars. Great product though,"I liked getting this one for my twin 10-month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans. I like the fact that it's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice. This list of ingredients looks excellent and it's a green color naturally.The babies liked it. They have liked everything that has carrots.I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I'm giving the babies food that is naturally green.Ingredients per the label: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.This has 70 calories, 8% protein, 40% vitamin A, 10% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 2% iron. I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
2,Baby didn't like it,"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!"
1,"Baby loves it, but there is plastic in it","This is my daughter's most favorite baby food by far. This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds. However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food. PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us."
1,FOUND SHREDDED PLASTIC IN THE BABY FOOD!!!!,"I normally love Earth's Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled! As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing."
3,Meh. My daughter eats most everything else... this isn't her thing.,"I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue. She loved it at first. But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite. I've tried some of it as well. Of all of them, this is also my least favorite."
3,Not as yummy as Earth's Best's other flavors,"We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein."
3,Too thin,Would be a quality product if it weren't so thin. Nearly the consistency of soup. It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be.
4,Clueless reviews,"This is a college textbook, meant to be used in conjunction with a class. Some of the reviews call it boring or difficult to understand. No kidding! This is an advanced class. In my college, it's co-listed as a computer science and mathematics course. Were people really expecting a Steven King novel?"
1,Great Read (For those of us with IQs higher than 180),"If you find yourself alone on a Friday night this may be the book for you. You'll learn plenty of notation with which to impress your friends. Learn new tricks, such as depth first parsing, construction if context free grammars, and even the highly controversial Greibach Normal Form (GNF)."
4,Taught by the author!,"Hey,I was fortunate enough to learn this course from the author of the book. The book by itself might seem tough. The fault lies in the fact that subject matter is not altogether too simple to understand without someone teaching it to you!With the help of the instructor, we did learn a lot about formal languages, finite automaton, regular grammer, etc.The key to understanding this material (and using this book effectively) is solving as many problems as possible, preferably in a group setting so that solutions can be discussed.Note: For most problems, there exists multiple solutions, and the approach is what needs to be learned and discussed.Recommended, with some reservations...Good luck!"
2,"No Examples , No Answers, No Hints","Besides the fact that the book is ""dry"", in which most Math theory based books are, the examples are just the basis step towards solving a problem. I equate it to teaching a child how to add, and just giving them the example ""1 + 0"", then assume they can figure out the rest. There are no answers, either in the back of the book for particular exercies, nor was a study guide made available. What is really shocking is that it's the most expensive book out there! Not to mention that there isn't any programming steps made available. Great text for a Math major ... horrible textbook for Computer Science Majors, mainly because computer science majors would want to see programming examples and may not be as strongly math oriented as a Math major would be."
4,Slovenia through pink-colored glasses,"If this third edition of Lonely Planet Slovenia is anything like the first, it warrants a complete overhaul of the section entitled ""WW II & the Partisan Struggle."" Much misinformation has been disseminated since the end of that war, and only recently has the truth emerged concerning the true patriots of Slovenia. It is obvious that the author was given false and outdated information, and he therefore unwittingly perpetuates the myth of the Slovenian ""collaborators."""
2,Will we ever hear the masters?,"The Seeds have been dismissed since they first arrived on the scene. This collection won't help that appraisal. Too bad. This is primal, grinding stuff that in the original vinyl configurations rocked with a unique, twisted snarl like few others from that era. The first album in itself, in its mono original form, is unlike any other. But this collection is just another excuse to recycle poor-sounding replicas of the masters. Plus, it lacks one of The Seeds classic, ""Out of the Question, often covered by bands in modern times. Too bad Audio Fidelity and Steve Hoffman were unable to secure the masters as they attempted to do several years ago due to ""Sky's people,"" whoever they may be."
4,The Seeds are a Groove,Having only heard 2 Seeds tunes in my life- I was somewhat skeptical that they could fill a double CD with 49 listenable tunes. But they proved me wrong. I would say that 2/3 of this CD is excellent- from the classic garage tunes on CD 1 to some of the surprisingly good blues on CD 2. I've listened to this CD several times since I purchased it- it's too good not to keep playing. Groove back to the 60's...
5,"New condition, fast delivery, great price","The price, even including shipping, was significantly lower than the local new/used record store in new condition. (I never found this product in used condition offline.) I am very pleased with the purchase."
4,Hardcore hooks and dark psychadellic-sound,"This trio is from Salt lake city, Utah's hardcore experimental scene. Throwing everything from Miles Davis, Annoymous4, Vivaldi, and Frank Zappa like modes into this guitar driven stew. Guts and Burn are key tracks to check out!"
5,The Great First CD By Iceburn Collective,"After this first CD this band added the word ""Collective"" after ""Iceburn"" to their name and got much more improvisational & avantgarde. That is not to say that there other CD's are not as good, just different. The tracks are much longer & more meandery. This one just flat out rocks in an excellent way. The musicianship is incredible. The first thing I thought was ""Experimental Metal"". Metal in tone but Avant experimental in execution. If you like heavy w/ lots of cool time changes than look no further."
5,Mr. Sizemore knows his subject and can communicate it.,"Mr. Sizemore knows firsthand the how to and why of traditional Tsalagi dress. His instructions and illustrations are clear and large. The resulting garments are both utilitarian and confortable. Thank you, Don."
5,The truth about fibromyalgia....and finally the cure!!!!,"I have been following Dr. Lowe's treatment for 6 weeks and finally have dramatic relief from the debilitating symptoms that I have had for over 20 years. I highly recommend this book for anyone suffering from pain and fatigue or fibromyalgia. This book can be a bit technical for someone who doesn't have a medical background, but explains the reasons for ""fibromyalgia"" symptoms and contains detailed information for treating thyroid resistance safely."
5,A valuable look at women in Mexican Revolution,"I've read this book as a reference for my thesis for my graduation, and it is one of the most important readings about women fighters in the Mexican Revolution.It is written by one of the most important Mexican writer and intellectual and she gives an insight of a side of Mexican history and society that helps to understand more about that country and its identity."
3,Not the Susan I wanted to see!,This was a very boring movie. I have a lot of herpictures and this one is the worse yet!
2,Math Teacher's POV,"This book, like many math books, lacks a logical progression and mystifies Trig even more. A person trying to learn it for the first time would just give up and move on to something else."
2,Too much missing,"Like another reveiwer, I also was very pleased with the Algebra Demystified book. As a long-time math disaster, I was able to test out of remedial Math and start College Algebra with a good foundation as a direct result of Albegra Demystified. After taking College Algebra, I returned to the Demystified Series to ramp me up on Trigonometry. I found that the author simply fails to explain his steps adequately. He makes too many assumptions about knowledge the student will possess. In fact, fresh out of College Algebra with a respectable high B, I was non-plussed after the earliest pages of Trigonometry Demystified, and actually found myself referring to my Algebra/Trigonometry textbook from college to clarify topics."
1,Worst math author ever.,"This individual,Stan Gibilisco, continues to write book after book despite his inability to write a math book.The first book of his that I purchased, Technical Math, was so badly written that it was totally useless. I swore that I would never buy another book by this author.I evidently forgot his name until I purchased this book. However after starting the first chapter and not believing a math book could be so badly written, his name hit me.This time fortunately I was able to return the book.Evidently publishers do not read readers reviews. Or maybe they don't care because some poor sap, that is not familiar with the author, will purchase his book. If they did care, they wouldn't hire him for another book.Some of the subjects sound really interesing until you see who the auther is and then you know to forget it...."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"Decent read, mildly entertaining, not the best wrestling book out but still a more than decent read."
5,Great all-around book,"This is one of the few backup books that isn't slanted toward a single product (such as a VERITAS book, or an EMC book). Covering what the authors found to be ""the most prominent problems in the network today,"" this book focuses on basic solutions for the problems that we all face in the real world.And it is written in a style that is part straight to the point and part humorous. The only thing that I would suggest adding is a set of powerpoint slides for training (maybe next time guys?).Is this book an in-depth book on every subject? No. This is not the be-all-to-end-all SAN backup book. Or RAID book. Or the ""best of breed"" for anything that it covers. But I don't think that the authors meant it to be a drill-down-to-the-bottom type of book. It covers what it needs to cover to suggest the right solution. And for most of us, that's just fine.But if I had to grab one book when I head out to think through backup problems, this is the book to grab."
5,Excellent Backup Resource,"An incredibly thorough, accurate and well thought-out reference guide written by the top talent in the industry. The Backup Book is an excellent resource for learning the basic concepts, technologies and techniques used in implementing successful backup strategies. It includes detailed information about the leading backup software products for both Windows and Mac environments. I refer to it all the time and it hasn't let me down once."
2,"A for Effort, C for Implementation","This is a difficult book to rate. If you look at it compared to what else is out there on this subject, its 4 stars. However, if you rate it as to whether it achieved the goals it set for itself, I would rate it a 2 star book. The essential problem is the book can not figure out where to place its emphasis. I complete agree with R Earl ""unixnut""'s review on this point. No one can expect to cover the breadth of this book's table of contents effectively. This is because no one author can know it all. That being said, professionals interested in backup should buy it in any case, just because there are so few titles in this area. For people who want more of a practical how to guide devoted to PC backup, check out How to Backup Your Windows Computer on DVD. Implementing Backup and Recovery is better for people interested in corporate backup."
4,everything you need for backup concepts,this book should be named Backup Bible because it covers everything. I give it 4 star because it covers too much basic concepts and stuff that people should already know before you become a backup operator.
3,"Good, but bloated and a bit sophomoric.","This book would have been great if it was 60% of the pages with the fluff and jokes cut out. Backup is a serious subject, and a few jokes may be cute, but they pervade the book to the point of becoming annoying. There is also too much time spent on the bare basics - it sometimes felt like the author had a page quota to meet.That said, it appears to be the only game in town covering the subject to this breadth and depth, and when the author cuts to the chase, he clearly has a good understanding of the problems and soulutions, with only a few technical errors (amusingly, the errors are just where the author appears to be trying to impress the reader with the depth of their knowledge.)"
2,Compatibility issue,This controller is great as far as functional and comfortable...only problem is it wasnt compatible for very many games. I'd skip this controller if you have the money to get the more expensive xbox 360 controller...its compatible with most games.
4,Good Controller,"My only grip about this is the fact that most computer games these days use the Xbox controller configuration- but then again this is not an Xbox controller. It is comfortable, and it maps well with most of the games I play so I cant complain. The buttons are all in good locations so I don't actually accelerate when I meant to brake."
3,"A good gamepad, but bad for retro gaming","This is a solid gamepad, well made and comfortable. However, if you're looking for a gamepad for retro gaming (for emulating 8-bit and 16-bit games, for example), look for something else.The D-Pad (arrow keys) is one large, bulky button that is very uncomfortable to use for the fast-paced motion of older games. Also, the four main right-hand buttons are clunky. They're very difficult to press rapidly (think of Megaman shooting or Mario flapping the raccoon tail, tasks made incredibly difficult by the clunky buttons).For more modern games where you'll be relying on the analog sticks and don't need to push the buttons as rapidly, it is quite good, and it is still possible to use for retro RPG's or games that generally don't require good controller response time. But for retro action games, this controller is severely disappointing."
2,Good gamepad if you don't need the D-pad,"This is actually a pretty good gamepad in general. However I planned on using it for Street Fighter 2 and other classic fighting games and the D-pad is one of the worst I have ever used. The joysticks have a button click, just like many of the consoles controllers, and someone thought it would be good idea to make the D-pad a button as well. Unfortunately that was a really bad idea. When attempting moves that involve complex actions on the D-pad, the pad depresses and twists making it very difficult or near impossible. There are certain moves that I can only pull off a fraction of the time with this controller, and other moves that I can barely pull off at all (ex: Shoryuken) but I can pull off nearly 100% of the time with the Xbox 360 controller. I bought the same controller for my nephew and it has the same problem so it isn't a defect, just a serious design flaw."
3,Doesn't work well with Madden 2005,"I've have tried for hours but this game pad will not work well with Madden 2005 for pc.I tried everything and the axis for the right analog stick are all screwed up.I purchased a regular logitech dual action gamepad and Madden 2005 recognized it by name under controller configuration. So I'm keeping the Dual Action controllerThe Rumblepad 2 controller seems like a high quality controller but I haven't had the oportunity to try it with any other game I was only interested in using it with Madden 2005 for PC, and disappointed when I found that the hit stick(right analog stick) was all screwed up. It's like the Y axis is the X axis and vice versa. I tried using the logitech software that comes with it but not even reconfiguring the controller buttons work.Even though on the package of the Rumblepad 2 states that it is made for all the latest EA Games i.e. Madden 2005They;re WrongStick with the normal Dual acion Logitech controller game pad."
3,Should 've come....,"It should have been packaged with a cool game... Otherwise, it works well enough to play Star War Legos, which is all my kids care about."
3,Meh...it's ok,"I guess I am used to PS2 controllers, this one just doesn't feel right. Even after playing with the settings it just doesn't play games as well as a console game does. Oh well, thats why there are consoles and PC, two totally different ways to game..."
5,Awesome,"Well well well, in my country there is no Logitech RP 2. When I my sister sent me this controller and after using it am totally satisfied. Even I won the WCG National championship. Simply this gamepad is one of the best."
5,Logitech Rumblepad 2 Does Indeed Rumble,"Great price. Very nice heft (weight), well balanced, buttons and sticks have excellent feel/click, tops of sticks are rubber-ish which makes them non-slip on sweaty fingers. Stick sensitivity is very good. Excellent software setup and mapping ability to include flipping the action of the left and right sticks. As for the vibration, this thing is not a wimp. When it rumbles it does so with authority. I have nothing to compare it to but I am totally satisfied."
1,Not worth your money,"Do not, I repeat, do not purchase this product. It worked fine for all but two weeks and began to malfunction as the mode light would always go on and disconnect the controller automatically. It was the worst purchase I've made on Amazon and I've made hundreds."
2,Whats going on?,O.K. the box says it works with the 05 EA sports games but theres no rumble if any one can help please send an e-mail thanx.
1,Absolutely Awful,"This controler is terrible for a number of reasons. I find it to be overpriced for the amount of quality that it has to offer. My friend bought me this controller some time ago and the d-pad broke after about a month. Compare this to one of the slim clear blue PC controllers that logitech sells for about $10. Those controllers lasted me about a year before breaking!Now, if you just need something to play emulators on, then I would suggest getting the smaller $10 logitech controllers. They are CHEAP and durable for the price that you can get them for. Great value! But if you're like me and want a controller to use for serious fighting games, then this is not the answer. The D-pad sticks too easily and eventually stops working. Avoid this controller because there are small, lighter, cheaper, more durable alternatives."
4,Nice Controller,The controller works fine with all my pc games except for NBA Live 2007; vibration feature doesn't work with this one.
4,"Good, except for SF4","This control pad is good, not great, for most games that'll take it, but I do not recommend it for SF4 or other games like 3s on an emulator. The D-pad is better than most, but still inadequate for any serious fighting games, especially the diags which will frustrate you to no end."
5,Good Controller,"This is pretty much everything you need for a USB controller, and fairly priced. I use it for video game emulators I have on my computer and it works very well. There are one or two games it doesn't work for, but I blame the ROM and not the controller. There are a couple of issues: The way the joysticks are designed, they seem to favor toward the diagonal, which can make it a pain to just move your character in a straight line. This isn't a deal breaker, but it does take getting used to. Also, though I've only had it for a couple of months, one button that I seem to use a lot has started sticking a bit, which makes me wonder about the controller's longevity. Nonetheless, it does feel very durable, and I wouldn't judge it so soon. Other reviews highlight its durability, so it's probably fine. Overall, these issues are negligible next to the simple pleasure of using a controller, rather than a keyboard, for games designed to be used by a controller. It is a worthwhile purchase."
5,Everything I Wanted,"This game pad is perfect for what I had in mind. I have a late 2008 24"" imac which it works perfectly with. I didn't need to use the software that came with it. All the controls work as described when I play my two racing games and the vibration feedback works. From reading the reviews before purchasing I wasn't sure this was the case and even from reading the box you could possibly get the wrong idea. Just plug it in and you should have no problems"
5,Simply Fantastic,The Rumblepad 2 is really Terrific and Highly Responsive :)It added a new joy to playing games.
3,It works but....,It has a problem with centering. You will be playing a game and it will slowly drift you vehicle to one side. Buying used is not always a wise choice. Now I will have to replace it.
3,No vibration,"I bought this, and they gave me the one without the vibration. It works, with my snes9x emulator though, so I'm happy"
4,Still need to use mouse for aiming/shooting in FPS games,"Could not get used to the too sensitive joystick for aiming in FPS, but was able to use the pad for movement and buttons for exchanging weapons etc while using the mouse in the other hand for aiming.Did not check the rumble feature due to the fact my games (Halo 2 , Half Life 2, Doom 3) are too old to have this interface in them."
3,Controller,"I use this a lot for Madden. However, I can't get the rumble feature to function with Madden."
4,Husband loves it,I bought this for my husband because he wanted to be more relaxed at the computer while he is playing games...as if hours playing games wasn't relaxing enough??? He loved it and wishes he had gotten it sooner. Only drawback...he's playing more games!!!
4,great gamepad,"This is a great gamepad. Very similar to the playstation controller. It's really comfortable, and everything still works for me."
1,Would be great if it worked,"The controller worked well while it lasted - which was exactly 2 days. The left analog joystick went haywire and caused movement without even touching it. All attempts to reset, including reistalling the software failed to correct the issue. So, like any good consumer, I returned the product thinking I had a faulty controller. Turned out the second controller acted up even faster - the same day.Don't waste your time on this product. You'd be better off getting the non-vibrating one. I've had the non-vibrating gamepad for 4 months now. Not one single problem to date."
2,Good while it lasted,"At first, this seemed like a great controller. It was easy to set up, and it's ability to run several sets of game profiles simultaneously was impressive. I didn't think I'd experience any of the problems that were always associated with the original Dual Action gamepad from logitech. But after only a few weeks of usage, the buttons became very sensitive, the controller didn't always respond right away, and the left analog stick began acting up, making alot of games unplayable. A nice design, but another failed attempt from Logitech."
2,Not as good as the playstation controller,"It can be programmed to work like the ps2 controller and works just fine except for a few problems with the game I play: Star Wars Battlefront 2. When you push down on the left analog stick it doesn't respond right away and sometimes has to be pushed really hard to do what it needs to. Also this stick tends to keep moving to the left when left alone after using. I don't knwo if I got a defective one or not but its quite annoying. Otherwise its not bad. For the game though too, not sure if game or stick, I have to reprogram the buttons every so offten because it resets to defaults. Anyway, not sure about others out there but this was a disappointment especially coming from logitech."
3,"Good controller, but no feedback with EA games.","This is an OK controller. It feels really nice in your hands. The analog controllers have a really nice feel and good sensitivity.The force feedback does not work with Need for Speed Most Wanted. I have searched the internet for an answer, but have yet to find one, so hopefully someone here can help me. I have read that newer EA games don't work with this controller's force feedback. I also have a Saitek P2500 controller and the force feedback does work with Need for Speed Most Wanted.Consider how many EA games you have in your collection before you purchase this controller.I'll stick with my Saitek, with I actually like better."
3,slightly defective,I was using this as a tool to control the mouse and other functions on some programs. Many times it would stick to the right just a little bit so even after I let go of the control stick the mouse would keep moving.Other then this (which made it worthless for why I purchased It)It is good.
4,"Controller very good, game not!","I got this controller to use it with the orange box games. Well, portal didn't id the controller keys and half-life has too many orders to put on the controllers."
3,"Work fine, but doesnt work on some game","work fine on most of the game, but some of the specific game like musou orchi doesnt really work on them."
2,FORCE FEEDBACK...WHAT FORCE FEEDBACK????,"I originally purchased the analog game pad with no vibration, then I purchased this controller. The only time I have felt force feedback was in FIFA 2005 during penalty kicks. I highly DO NOT recommend this controller, get the regular gamepad and save 10 bucks.However, the layout is great and it is extremely comfortable to hold."
2,Poor quality,"This gamepad was fine until it fell from a height of about 2 feet and landed on a hardwood floor. After that, the ""LB"" button stopped functioning. I took it apart and found that the ""clicker"" device that triggers a button press wasn't responding to the correct amount of pressure anymore. Since then, the gamepad has stopped working completely.This will be the last Logitech product I buy,"
4,Decent,"A little small for me (I'm 6'3"") but still comfortable. Had problems working in Devil May Cry until I shut down the driver software. Needed to rebind my keys when switching, but it works as it is supposed to."
5,A rare treat,"This is a highly personal, very readable and moving account by an academic critic of his reading of Melville, Poe, Whitman, Henry Miller, Henry James and Jack Kerouac - all writers whose encounter with New York somehow mirrored or influenced Tytell's own relationship to the city, and indeed his life. It's the story an intellectual odyssey but also very much of the author's emotional growth. I loved this book and could hardly put it down."
5,Inspiring,"Having seen Tytell in Manchester, VT, at a reading of his book we eagerly awaited ""Reading New York"" and weren't disappointed. The same enthusiasm he expresses in public is demonstrated in his book. He has inspired us to reread Melville, Miller and others. Thank you for reminding us of them."
4,classic toy that is both sturdy and nice looking,"I bought this for my 1 year old. He likes to push it around like a walker. He is not into riding it yet but I am sure that will come. My 4year old likes to ride it-very sturdy-and goes zooming around the house. Works well on both carpet and hard floors. Personally, I bought it because I am tired of plastic toys that make noise. This wooden horse has a classic look and actually doesn't look half bad in our living room-not an eye sore like some of the other ride ons."
3,Not so satisfied,Unless you looking for 6-1yr; dont even think for >1yr kind. Not that much fun becuase they cant even sit.
5,My Philosophy says it's a great album,"There is not a song on this album that you will not remember after just a few listens. Pop/hooks to the extreme on Jackson Cannery, Philosophy, Underground and Best Imitation of Myself. Ben Folds Five showed their potential right out of the box on this great debut. Highly recommended."
4,Marvellously mad and frenetic fun!,"An energetic raw introduction to this eccentric trio. An unusual combo of piano & vocals (Ben Folds), bass and drums works surprisingly well, with Folds hammering-chords more than compensating for the lack of guitar.Many pianists will be trying to play his cunning riffs... Put this in the car and you'll soon be bashing the dashboard rather than playing air-guitar at the traffic-lights. Whilst their later offerings have been more polished (and with the exception of ""Whatever and Ever, Amen"" less satisfying), none have been as frantically engaging and down-right fun as this little stormer.A perfect summer record - crank it up, open the windows and find new friends. Everyone seems to like this stuff, but they don't know who it's by. Educate them!"
4,"Great start, but they get even better!","I do like this CD a lot but, it is not my favorite. That award goes to the Rheinhold Messner album. But, this one is not without merit. In fact the CD is perfect until 'Sports and Wine' and then after that it kind of deflates, but it is redeemed by the excellent tune ""Boxing"". All in all a pretty good CD. But, they have released better ones. In fact, Ben Folds Five are one of the few groups that get better with every CD! If you ever get the opprotunity, don't pass up a chance to see them live, both times I've seen them they were excellent!"
4,You should buy this CD,"This album is excellent, but not quite as good as ""Whatever And Ever Amen."" I say this because ""WAEA"" evokes a wider variety of emotions, often switching between humor and sorrow, and because WAEA is consistently incredible throughout. This eponymous album has high points and, I think, a low point. ""Underground"", ""Uncle Walter"", ""Philosophy"", and ""Alice Childress"" are awesome; ""Julianne"" falls well below average; and the rest of the album is very good. Why none of these songs have ever been played on my local radio stations is beyond me."
4,An Underrated CD,"In most stores, you couldn't find this CD until ""Naked Baby Photos"" came out. Well, this eclipses ""Naked Baby Photos"" with Summer B, Underground, Uncle Walter, Jackson Cannery, and the whole lot... it's really a great CD for the BFF fan. Ben Folds follows no rules- this is true mastery, without taking itself too serious."
5,A wonderful 70's pop inspired debut filled with wit.,"I love this CD. I listen to this and all of my other BF5 CDs constantly. It is the perfect mix of nostalga and great songwriting. It is musically and lyrically sound, and often very witty. ""Philosophy"" and ""Summers B"" are two of my favorites."
5,Unarguably their best,"Although ""Whatever and Ever Amen"" highlights several songs which one should not live without (e.g., ""Evaporated""), their first album is their best. In each song the magnificent power of the piano in rock and roll shines as it had never before Billy Joel. There is a personal feel to these songs, knowing that as they grow in your soul through time, they will NOT be overplayed like ""Brick"". Check out ""Philosophy"" ""Underground"" and ""The Last Polka"". Even ""Boxing"" ""Sports and Wine"" and ""Video"" can be so amusing."
4,Capsule Review - Ben Folds Five,"The best place to start for wannabe Ben Folds afficionados, the 1995 debut is stuffed with wonderful tunes and winning couplets - and not a guitar in sight. Philosophy, Where's Summer B? and Underground are obvious highlights, but other tracks win their way into your heart and mind - the melancholy Boxing or the defiant Best Imitation Of Myself, for instance. A stunning debut, and one Folds has come close to, if not fully bettering."
3,Work your way up from here!,"The first BFF album I purchased was ""Whatever And Ever Amen,"" off the strength of previously heard songs and viewed videos like ""Battle of Who Could Care Less,"" ""One Angry Dwarf.."" and the ever-popular ""Brick."" So I backtracked and got this one. It's a good album, but for me, it lacks some of the perfectly meshed rock and pop brilliance that made ""Whatever and Ever Amen"" a masterpiece. This album is one that I really have to listen a while to get that gratification that came so easily when I pressed the play button on ""Whatever..."" It doesn't really bring me in honestly. But I do love Ben Folds Five. If you're a really big fan and want to try some of the earlier works, I would recommend this one. As you can see, there are a lot of 5-star reviews for this one. And of course, ""Whatever.."" is a high-ranked album here, too. When Ben Folds Five, I've noticed that they've become like wine, getting better with age. Start from here and move up through the BFF world."
5,Incredible debut album!,"Wow. If you're a fan of piano rock (ala Elton John, Billy Joel, etc..) or even if you're not, this CD promises to make you wish you'd continued your piano lessons! Ben Folds rocks the house with his ivory-pounding fists and melodic genius. Every song on this rockyjazzypunky powerhouse is a winner. I think this album smokes 'Whatever and ever.."", but some will disagree. This cd is essential to any collection."
4,Half indie but ready for mainstream,"It's a little rough around the edges (as evidenced by the band's ""comments"" at the end of several tracks), but that's part of the beauty of it. The hit single ""Underground"" is a fun tribute to the indie scene, and shares the distinction of catchiest track with ""Where's Summer B.?"" ""Summer"" is a perfect, feel-good song perfect for catching rays in the summer. Most of the album is like that, except for some of the last tracks, which are slower and darker at times (especially ""The Last Polka"".) But it's a great first effort, and if you like this, you'll love their next album, ""Whatever and Ever Amen""."
5,My Favorite Ben Fold Five Album - Fresh Sounds,"If you aren't familiar with the band they consist of a piano/lead singer (who's name is Ben Folds), a bass, and drums. They have a very unique sound, and they all came out of heavy metal bands (weird, huh). This album gives me the feeling that this is the real, raw Ben Folds. Before the crazy success of ""Whatever and Ever Amen"" due to the song ""Brick"". My favorites on this CD are ""Jackson Cannery"", ""Alice Childress"", ""Underground"", and ""Boxing"". If you bought Whatever and Ever Amen I highly recomend you experience this side of Ben Folds Five, and if you are just looking for a great album with a fresh sound, this is it."
1,"RATING THE VINYL PRESSING, the music is AMAZING.","This is literally the worst vinyl pressing I have ever purchased. The sound is wretched. As soon as I finished listening to the album I hit the internet to see if anyone was complaining about the label's vinyl quality and sure enough people are trashing Plan Recordings pressings left and right. Don't buy this if you're expecting it to sound like vinyl should, it sounds like a crappy MP3 pressed to vinyl. If you just want a copy of the album and don't care about the sound, have at it.STAY AWAY FROM PLAIN RECORDINGS VINYL!"
