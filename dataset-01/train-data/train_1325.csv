2,Perfect Waste of Time,"I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie. I'm a staunch believer that books are always better than their movie counterparts. For this particular book, I hope this is not the case.I was looking for an human interest story, what I got was a mariner's manual. Of the approximate 290 pages of the book, perhaps 150 of the pages actually had something to do with the Andrea Gail and her seamen. The other 140 pages were dedicated to explaining different aspects of swordfishing, tunafishing, history of Gloucester, history of the New England fishing industry, and nuclear testing, above all things.I do respect the amount of research Mr. Junger has put into his book, but one must wonder if he just lumped together a bunch of magazine articles and tried to bind them together, rather than telling a real story, with some sort of character development. It felt like I was reading a documentary. Let's hope the movie based on the book doesn't become a documentary as well."
5,You won't want to put it down.,"A very inciteful read. For someone who has never spent a day on a fishing boat of this magnitude, Junger paints a picture that is vivid and terrifying. You'll gain a new respect for nature, open water and the people who not only make a living on the sea, but also those who protect them. Even so, as the story of the Andrea Gail unfolds, we see that the best efforts of man is nothing in comparison to what nature can dish out.You won't want to put it down. It's as good of a book as you will read this summer"
4,"A Good, Solid Read","In a world that's more and more about go along to get along and where people will barely risk embarrassment let alone their lives, this is a story of people still working at sea and taking mortal risks to earn a livelihood. It protrays an older, more elemental world where survival is more important than being on a wining team and where can-do optimism pales beside the fury of a storm at sea. Junger has written a truly interesting and unique book. Something worthy of the New Yorker before it turn to chic literary voguing. To someone who once spent a few days in a small sailboat in the middle of a gail, it brought back the confusion and terror of the sea. I recommend it to anyone who loves the elements. Also, take a look at Allard Coles' classic, Heavy Weather Sailing"
3,"Not bad, but not great...",The story isn't really about The Andrea Gail...the story is about various happenings during the storm. This book is okay...
4,a well written non-fiction work,"the sea is always a good topic to write about as long as it's not another cousteau ""infomercial"" about man and the sea. throw in the super power of mother nature and we get intrigued. the story of the andrea gail is a well researched and well told story by junger. it may be riding on the ""titanic"" wave....but the awesome power of mother nature overrides any ability of man to counteract her. highly recommended if you like the sea and are familar with navigation and seafaring."
5,5 stars and a full moon!,"Make no mistake, the main character of this story is the storm...Others have their moments in the limelight, but the storm is always there. It will have your entire attention through the last page. It may be the best adventure story you will ever read; don't miss it."
4,The Perfect Storm or the Not so Perfect Storm,"The book, The Perfect Storm is a true story about a sword fishing boat that was send out in the sea late in the season, because it's last catch was not good enough. The captain was getting a hard talk from his boss because he was not pulling in as much fish as his other boats were. This is where it all turns wrong. Where their normal fishing spot wasn't good enough for the amount of fish they have to catch, so they have to head out further to sea. When out at sea the ship and crew face many problems. Just as they were done and had the catch of their life time they set back home. They never saw the storm coming or shall I saw both storms coming right at them."
3,"Good, but not so good","The Perfect Storm was a pretty good book, but I think the author went into too much detail. Half of the book wasn't even centered on the Andrea Gail anyway, it was centered on some other ships. But if you are really into sailing and fishing, this book is for you!"
4,"If you know the sea, then you will love the book","This book is written for the reader who has some understanding of the sea- the terms used, the stories told, etc... They all require a reader to grasp the basics. This book is great if you can say that you know this stuff. If not, I would recommend waiting for the movie."
4,"Interesting book, but some technical detail inaccurate.","Mr. Junger has some minor flaws in his technical details. Otherwise, the book is a good read.In describing the National Weather Services origins he states that the Commerce Department oversees aviation and interstate trucking. The Department of Transportation, and its aviation branch, The Federal Aviation Administration, word have a problem with the reassignment of responsibilities. Further on, in the same section, he states that the information relayed back from weather balloons is done by theodolite. Unfortunately, a theodolite is a device similar to a surveyors transit to measure horizontal and vertical angles. Mr. Junger, possibly, is confusing a theodolite with a radiosonde. The book is interesting reading. I am having a hard time putting it down. The mixture of the story with the historical facts is well done."
4,Great book ... interesting reviews,"The reviews will give you a good idea of the book. For my part, I couldn't put it down.Yes, there are a few annoying copy-editing glitches. Yes, you need to have a brain and an attention span.I was amazed at seeing negative reviews here, but after reading them, I think I understand them a bit better. Some found the detail distracting or worse. Some looked for more excitement (and lost me right about there; I don't see how anyone would want or need more excitement in a book than they'd find in The Perfect Storm). One or two could be summed up along the lines of, ""Gee, only a few people died and I didn't like them, so why should anyone care?"" I'm not sure what you call that. Empty, I guess.I've bought copies for friends and will keep doing that. In my driver's manual, that comes under the heading of High Praise."
2,Good Story - Lukewarm writing,"If you like exciting stories, skip the first half of this book and read the remainder. If you like good writing, skip the whole thing."
2,Disappointing,"While somewhat interesting, I found the focus on the Andrea Gail unsatisfying since no one could say with certainty exactly what happened to the crew. I found the section on the parajumpers more interesting and, for me, it saved the book from being a complete waste of time. Still, I did throw it out when I finished with it...something I almost never do with a book.For those interested in the sea and its many faces, I would recommend John McPhee's Looking for a Ship as a far superior book."
5,Blew me away with the force of a hurricane!,"So well written! Junger made me really feel for these people, their lives & respect the jobs they've chosen to risk their lives in. Growing up in Seattle I learned at an early age to respect the power of the open oceans, but what I've experienced in no way compares to the dangers the inhabitants of Gloucester live and breathe each day. I read the book before the movie & I was pleasantly surprised at how well the movie & the actors were able to bring the book to life. I am on Amazon today to purchase Junger's most recent book about the Boston Strangler, ""A Death in Belmont"". The man who eventually confessed to 13 of the strangulations had been working on Junger's house for 6 months during the murders. He says that he makes a jury out of us, the readers, in regard to the murder in Belmont which was not confessed to. I can't wait!"
4,The Perfect Storm,"I had gotten out of the habit of reading, and not much was inspiring me. Junger's book did. I think the biggest problem is saying that the book is about a sailing vessel that went down. It is not. It is about much more than that, although that event does provide the focal point. I thought the writing had an intelligent mix of exposition and poetic image. I've also read two bestsellers recently and was disappointed in how much skimming I did without feeling that I had lost much. I did no skimming in The Perfect Storm. I thought Junger made weather and the commercial fishing industry as interesting as the drama of the ""story"". I believe those who love quality will be glad they read this book."
4,The Perfect Storm,"Gloustermen and the sea. These fishermen set forth on a journey to the Flemish cap for an abundant find in fish, to catch and earn money. They were successful in capturing an abundant amount of fish, however, their ice machine broke, which was used to keep the fish fresh, and they were forced to return home. During this event they were informed of a catastrophic hurricane was in their path, and also colliding with a cold front. This was a disaster in epic proportions. They decided to chance it anyway, and the powerful forces of nature proved to be too much for them and they were lost at sea. This book in my opinion was a good book."
2,The Perfect Bore???,"This book is ridiculous. Although I thought it looked interesting when I first started, it's actually quite boring. No offense to the author, he did his job very well, but the subject and actual structure of this book together was what casually led me to drowsiness. The amount of effort put into the book is extraordinary, and it totally shows in the awesome details and facts thrown in by the author, who really did his research. The book was confusing in the beginning, got boring real quick, but finished off decently. Overall it wasn't worth the read."
3,so-so book on good topic,"First 2/3 of book are worth 5/10; last 1/3 is an 8. Odd jumping between (interesting) digressions and (interesting) storyline mars book. Writing itself only so-so as well. I read POB, but couldn't get into this ""story"" until the end where he pretty much settles on one thread."
2,Send a rescue Editor!,"The story related is interesting enough to carry the reader's interest, but the writing is atrocious and I can't understand how such a book gets the media wave to become a best-seller. The writing lacks dramatic pace, the story line is choppy, and there is a dismaying lack of compassion. The publisher is equally at fault for not demanding more careful editing and re-writing. If you want to hear a harrowing tale told right, read Krakauer's Into Thin Air. It sets a standard for humanistic adventure writing that A Perfect Storm cannot touch."
4,Good info for you land lubbers,An interesting peak into the lives of the commercial fisherman and what might have become of the crew of the Andrea Gail. The author takes some liberties with the story because no one actually knows what happened besides that there was a huge storm. The book is a little choppy in places but is easily read in 1 or 2 sittings. It gave me insight into an area where I had none. A good summer/beach read!
2,Barely whets appetite on suspense; too much dry detail,"""A reader"" on 5/26/98 has echoed my feelings on this book perfectly. I expected a suspenseful read with laced with vivid human drama; I expected a ""page-turner"". What I found was a true life event with far too much techno-talk and a story (""the worst strom of the 20th century"") that unfolded as fast as ketchup runs out the bottle."
4,Excellent in surprising ways.,"Junger's book ends up being fascinating for many different reasons, despite its weird structure. It starts out as the tale of one fishing boat caught in the ""perfect storm"", but since no one lived to tell the story of that boat, much of the excitement of the story comes from his patching together other stories. Besides, for the most part, the lives of the fishermen and those they lived with on land are less than compelling because these are ordinary rather than exceptional people. By far the best and most compelling writing in the book is about the Air National Guard helicopter that goes down after a rescue attempt. Other interesting segments of the book deal with the basic mechanics of long-line fishing (i.e., how it is done today), the mechanics of drowning, and meteorology. Junger has strung together a variety of almost stand alone chapters, but the end result still for the most part captivates one's attention."
5,You'll taste the salt and hear the waves!,"The documentary style puts the reader in the center of the lives of these ill-fated fishermen. The details of the fishing business are an education in themselves, but flow unobtrusively through the story. I could close my eyes and see the towering waves that turned one ship sideways and tossed high enough to give the rescue helicopter pilot cause for concern. The author has constructed a story based on events that actually happened. He brought the people and events of the days of the ""perfect storm"" to life in a way that made them all too real and important to someone who had never met them."
1,Boring!,"I read a excerpt of this story in my IB english class.(Freshman)I found it to be extremely boring as did many of my peers. Although it is a nonfiction, I think that it could have been better written to make it a more interesting story. Something else I would like to bring up is that not many people know alot about baots the frequent usage of boating terms was useless for describing the story because I did not understand a word of it"
2,Too Technical,"This would have been an interesting story, if the author had stuck to the main story and not gone off into several different directions, and I really don't care to know about every little detail of how a ship is run. I wanted a story, not a fishing manual!"
3,The Perfect Way to Waste 7 dollars,If I was a sailor or a fisherman I might have been able to enjoy this book. Sadly I am not and as a result this book was a complete let down. About 90% of this book is complete hogwash about the interworkings of a fishing boat. If you want to learn about the crew of men who star in the movie watch the special on NBC b/c like the rest of us the author has no idea what went down on that boat the night it sunk. Save your money/time/and effort and go to the movie.
4,Like to learn when you read?,"You'll learn about the swordfishing business, meteorology, oceanography--and the science of drowning. I read the book in one sitting--a long sitting. (Perfect for a rainy day).Yes, the author makes his own story of the happenings on the Andrea Gale but it made sense to me. The author's story rendition brought to life what must be one of the most frightening things to experience and to not live to talk about.The only thing that bothered me is that the author was able to go to press with some glaring errors in the book--especially one page near the end where he either misnames a nuclear plant (it should be the Seabrooke plant) or mislocates the one he names (Pilgrim is in Plymouth, MA) and misspells ""Scituate, MA."" Also, some of his sentences don't agree in verb tense... and sometimes his pronoun uses maddeningly doesn't match the antecedent...and once the punctuation was wrong!...but you can tell I'm a nerd...Read it! It's good for you!"
3,"Half interesting, half ho-hum","The book spends about half of the pages detailing the life stories of the people associated with a particular boat (owner, sailors, wives and children), which was of limited interest to this reader. The other half presents information about fishing boats, rough weather, and coping with stormy seas, which was very interesting. The writing is okay, neither electrifying nor annoying. However, the lack of specifics about what really happened, requires the author to explain the tale by recounting similar adventures. It might have been better to focus the story on another boat, where solid facts could be related. This is not the work of a polished author, but is a good effort for a first-timer. Probably best read at night during a raging thunderstorm."
5,WOW,"The book was just a terrific read. Even beginning knowing how it ended, I still wonderred how he could keep us interested in it, and he did. He described drowning so well I thought I was going through it, and the amount of research he put in the book was also amazing. The grade A+ is well earned. It is easy to read and you will be able to get through in no time. You hoped that the boat will survived even though you know it won't. WOW is a good way to describe the book. Excellent read."
3,"Great hype, but does Junger live up to it?","I had heard a lot about this book and picked it up at a bookstore at an airport and read it while on the plane. whew! i felt that it was a plain read, i applaud Junger's narrative and craft, but i left the book feeling that something was missing. the characters could have been brought forward in a much etter way. overall, a good book, but only if you like the sea, i guess."
4,The Perfect Storm,"The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger is one of the best nonfiction books I have ever read. Although this book could have easily done without the first fifty pages, once the journey begins you cannot put this book down. Junger has somehow managed to create an amazingly thorough account of the last three days of six men's lives. It is a wonderful story about real people and real things that happened to them. Junger also gives a lot of factual information about the fishing industry, like marine behavior and fishing methods. This is an informative yet thrilling nonfiction book."
4,VERY SUPRISINGLY INTERESTING BOOK....,"THIS BOOK NOT ONLY DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THE FINAL MOMENTS IN THIS ""PERFECT STORM"" TO ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED, MAKING FOR A VERY SCARY READ UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT, IT ALSO GOES IN GREAT DETAIL OF A FISHERMAN'S LIFE. I LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS LIFE THAT I REALLY HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT,EVEN AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE. ALSO AGAIN, WITH THE DETAILS, U FEEL AS THOUGH U WERE ON THE WATER, GOING THRU THIS MONSTER. A GREAT READ!!"
4,Great Book!,"I hung on to every word of this book! As a meteorologist, I was thrilled at how in depth Junger was with regard to the actual storm! This book introduced me to a way of life that I had never known about before reading it. Every detail was flushed out and really made me feel like I was on that boat!"
2,This book is a mess.,"The Perfect Storm is an imperfect story. This book promises a lot, but it doesn't pay off until the final third. What transipred on the Andrea Gail is unkonwn, even if you've read the book. It has a lot of ""Well, if the sea did this, then the people on board might have done this."" And then the formation of a storm or the history of a bar is discussed for 15 pages. The book's high point is near the end when the Air National Guard rescues are being discussed. I was very disappointed by the book."
3,"good in detail, but lacking in some aspects","I found this book to be exciting at times, but dull at other times with too much technical jargon. My biggest complaint centers on the missing man Rick Smith, whom you think will be found right up to the end, but then nothing more is written about him. I also didn't care for the present tense the author used."
4,Much better than I had expected,I didn't think that I would like this book. I had heard that Junger had posed with his shirt off for People magazine and I thought that he must be some lightweight puff. But the book is very well written and well researched. For those of us who sit behind desks all day there is a certain romanticism in this type of life. But when you read what these guys go through on a typical fishing run the fantasy is quickly dispelled.Once you are through with this read Linda Greenlaw's The Hungry Ocean. Not as compelling a story as Junger's but very good.
1,Over-rated and at times very boring book.,"This might be an ok book if you're involved in the industry, but for all others it just doesn't ring true. You know from the beginning that no one knows exactly what went wrong with the Andrea Gail. Also, the accounts of other fishermen with similar experiences reads more like a survey or a part of a case study than an actual story. The author should have at least stuck to one storyline and tried to make us believe that we were with the the sailors from the beginning of the trip to the end. This is a very disjointed book, as someone said earlier."
1,I couldn't wait to put this book down.,"If it wasn't for the section describing the Navy rescue attempt, this book would not have been worth reading. This book has been unjustly compared with ""Into Thin Air,"" which was an exciting, eye-witness description of the events on Mount Everest.In 'The Perfect Storm,'the descriptions of what *may* have happened on the Andrea Gail were, at best, fictional. The author should have focused the story on one of the activities of one of the other boats in the hurricane.I would not give this book even a one-star rating if there was an option."
5,"""A gripping story of untamed nature.""","Many stories have been written about man and the sea.This book grips the reader and does not let go. If anything, the author makes us realize that we have not conquered the sea, it just. accomodates us according to it wishes. Dr. Frank P. Merlo"
2,It should have been a great book,"What a great idea for a book. The weather - we all know about it, most talk about it at least once a day, if not more. What a chance to take this often poorly understood topic and transform it to something really exciting. Imagine, a very low pressure system, so low it raises the ocean beneath it next to a very high pressure system of very cold air in Canada. Now imagine the forces at work between them. I can see masses of cold and warm air feuding for supremacy. Alas, what I found in the book were pages and ponderous pages of boozing people in pubs. Then more plodding pages of what the storm could have been like. In summary, a great idea, that needed just a little more work."
2,Not so Perfect for Me,"I am one of those readers who normally prefers to finish a book, even when I am not ""feeling it"".I got 1/4 of the way into this one, and gave it up as a bad job. I certainly don't wish to speak ill of those who I presume died...but there wasn't a character in this book that had a single redeeming feature, as they were described in it.I am very character focused in those books I enjoy, and I enjoy them most when I like at least some of the characters; I liked no one in this book. No one.The detailed descriptions of the day-to-day work and technicalities were boring; the book just never seemed to go anywhere.I gave it two stars because the author at least used correct grammar and syntax; I save the one stars for those who can't even do that."
2,A Sad Story Sadly Written,"i read this book because i was intrigued, and indeed touched, by the story of these fisherman...i soon after saw the movie, and i am sad to say that this is the one in a million time that the movie is better than the book....Junger weighed down this novel with boring stories about the history of fishing and a bunch of other meaningless drivel...the story is of course sad, though it is thrilling (as evidenced by the action in the movie) but the book drags unbelievably...its sad to say that such a tale has been told in such a poor way"
3,"Long On Facts, Short on Drama","I can't believe this book was a bestseller...it is a very informative book about the lives of New England fisherman, about how waves and storms are formed, and how the Coast Guard responds to mayday distress signals. But a compelling read it is not...I found it very easy to put down to do other things. It is so detailed, I kept wishing for more pictures and drawings of the stuff it was talking about. If one of my kids ever needs to do a book report on commercial fishing or how to forecast the weather, this would be a great start. But would I recommend it to most people I know?...NO..only my father-in-law, who loves the sea and once sold boats for a living. If the movie follows the book, it is going to be boring for most viewers."
2,Boring!,"I looked very forward to reading this book. I loved Into Thin Air and was told to read Perfect Storm. I read the many positive reviews for this book in the papers and magazines. And yet, despite all the hype, and now new hype for the film, I found the book boring. I had such high expectations for this book and I was disappointed. Yes, a tragic story, but in my opinion a very boring book."
2,The movie is much better,"The book accounts too many details on what the crew ate, drank, and purchased before their fateful voyage. We also get too many scientific lessons in how big waves are made. Not enough words spent on the storm and real drama. The best parts are the helicopter rescue attempts near the end of the book."
3,I think this book lacked detail of the main story line.,I thought this book focused too much on historical facts and educational facts on fishing than the actuall occurance. It was too broadened and would have been better had it detailed the happenings on the ANDREA GAIL.
3,"Riveting book, but wish there was less technical detail.","I really enjoyed the book, and at times couldn't put it down. Some of the technical details were a bit much for me, but I found that I could skim over them and still understand what was happening. Junger sure shows how frightening and powerful this very real storm was, while teaching the reader about the commercial fishing industry as well as the demanding occupation of rescue workers."
3,Maybe I'm being tough after reading Into Thin Air,"Jon Krakauer's masterly prose, first person narrative and concise writing, IMHO, makes a far superior analysis and ""can't put down"" read than this book. While both stories are different and equally tragic, I found this book not in the same league in terms of organization or style."
2,Folks who love Krakauer's books can't think well of Junger.,"If you love Jon Krakauer's books, Into Thin Air, etc. you'll hate Junger's The Perfect Storm. Why did this book get such good reviews? Beats me. I wonder of those who loved it ever read a GOOD adventure book like Into Thin Air? J.K. needs to learn to WRITE and then how to make a good story suspenseful and present! I'm giving the STORY 2 stars and Junger none!!!!!"
3,Seems he tried to imitate Krakauer's style but without,"the same impact. Since this book is so technical it would help to include a diagram of a fishing boat(s) with parts labeled. It also might help to include a few diagrams of the instruments, anemometer, and a boat in different kinds of swells, pitch, etc. Mountain climbing is easier to describe because: 1). More people have been exposed to it either through advertising, hiking etc. 2). A picture of a guy in his clothing on a mountain does it: 3). Fewer people fish, let alone experience the high seas. Better character development and more connection to the story would improve it. The difference also is Krakauer is a mountain climber and experienced his disaster first hand. The author of this novel was a researcher and had not experienced this for himself. Though it is not necessary to experience an adventure to write about it I never did really understand who was telling the story."
5,Great read!,"I knew next to nothing about the fishing industry, other than it was hard work and troubled. 'The Perfect Storm' was a real eye-opener into the fishing industry and the dangers those who pursue this line of work face everyday. I highly recommend this book."
5,Exceptionally compelling read; interesting science,"This is an exceptional piece of non-fiction that I couldn't put down. The book works on several levels--the multi-faceted story is compelling and the science behind the weather and events that unfold, fascinating. Junger keeps coming with page after page of interesting perspectives and keen observations. For example, when describing the logistical difficulty in jumping from a helicopter into a storm tossed ocean. (Jump at the wrong moment missing the crest of a wave, and you fall 80 additional feet through the air to its base). The interviews and science behind the events add another layer to the storyline.One of my ""Top 20"" favorite books. The writing here is first rate, and the investigative journalism as good as it gets. As must read for folks who enjoy the kind of reporting found weekly in the New Yorker. Another similar tale of equal excitement is ""Isaac's Storm,"" about the hurricane that struck Galveston in 1900 killing 6 to 8,000 people."
5,"A rivetting read of men, tragedy and the power of the sea.","With almost clinical precision, Sebastian Junger takes you from the background to this tale to the point where you can feel the wind and the waves battering at you as you read.For those of us who venture onto the sea, or who dream of doing so, this book is a reading ""must.""Feel the power of the sea and the near helplessness of man and his machines when confronted with the enormity and devastating force of the ocean.Junger has captured the inter-connected threads of these events so well that, after reading the book, you are left feeling convinced that it was you who lived through the storm"
2,"An overrated, overblown magazine article","This book was easy airplane reading, easily finished in a trip from Dallas to Portland, but left me incredibly unsatisfied. The execution of the book's premise, capturing the last days of a doomed crew, is flawed. The author has limited information on what actually happened and fails to adequately speculate. Moreover, he only captures the personality of one of the crew members. When the author realizes he has to fill up 200 pages to justify the $25 price, he starts on several new ""magazine articles"", having little to do with the story.This book had a great premise and some interesting insights into the fishing industry, but unfortunately is easily forgotten."
1,Not Worth the Money (or the time),"There has been a lot of hype about this book and I'm not sure why. I read this book expecting to learn about the tragic event that occurred in the Atlantic and instead the book gives various scenarios that might have happened. These hypotheticals are distracting because it interrupts any semblance of a story. At the very least, the author could have followed one hypothetical through to its logical end. Instead, we're given random facts along with the hypotheticals which purport to explain different aspects of navigation. The author could really have benefitted from reading ""Into Thin Air"", which is a far superior book and tells a fascinating story. That is what's missing from ""A Perfect Storm"" - a good story told in an interesting way."
1,Beware!,"Horrible book straight ahead! No coherent structure exists for this ""story"". Down, down your hard-earned money goes!"
3,Not so perfect,"Sebastian Junger is a competent journalist....I have no quarrel with his facts..some of them were even interesting. However I want the books I read for enjoyment to touch my heart...there was none of that here. I found no real kinship with any of the victims, I just didn't know enough about them to care much. This is a jounalistic drama about a storm that could not have been technically worse and the people caught in the middle of it. The story is reconstructed though interviews with survivors, victims families, rescuers and data gathered from the weather service. Should you read it...sure, you will learn about weather patterns and how commercial fishing fleets work, but don't expect tears to well or hair to raise."
3,I was expecting more,"I didn't get what I wanted out of the book. I wanted an adventure story where you really got to know the characters. I also wanted to find out about the commercial fishing industry. I got the latter part I described, but was left without a feeling of emotion. It was like I had just watched a Discovery Channel special about 'The Perfect Storm.' That's not a bad thing if that is what you are looking for, but if you want a serious adventure thriller look at 'Into Thin Air.' Junger uses simple language where you don't need to really focus on what he is saying, but he jumps around a little too much. One highlight that Junger really hits on the head is when he describes what it is like to actually drown. Yes, he describes it with amazing detail."
3,Not so perfect,"An entertaining read, describing an incredible event. However, I found the prosaic writing style a little off-putting. The book seemed to be aimed at grade school kids."
3,Imperfect Storm,"Whomever chose, or rather, allowed Stanley Tucci (whom I've liked as an actor --till now)to read a book for posterity should be flogged -- because it amounts to a form of torture listening to his monotone drone on for the length of this book. I have to say it's ironic that the story (there's really not much of a story either since Junger doesn't know what happened to the boat in question after it took off so it's all supposition)centers around a rising storm and Tucci's voice never changes no matter what happens on the page!"
3,A little hard..,"After I saw the movie , I got interested so I read the book. The book was just like the movie , with a little more insight and interviews with families of the crew. Sometimes it went off topic, and he sometmes jumped around with different subjects. If you saw the movie and are curious about like how they got all the information , who the characters were , ect , then read this book!"
1,It was written by a journalist...,"And you can tell. This book reads like a 100+ page newspaper article. And while newspaper style is very nice for short, half page articles, it is not good for a book.I have to admit, I may be a bit biased. I tend to carry a bit of a grudge against largely overrated popular books. But the fact is, reading this book was torture. Every few pages, Junger seemed to go off on tangents longer than the actual story. He goes into absurdly unnecessary discussions of the technology involved, and even I, a geek and technophile, was bored to tears.So, basically, an interesting historical story completely ruined by awful narrative, excessive detail, and an incapability to stick to the point.Give this one a miss."
4,A horrible way to go,Found this nightmarish tale to be one that I couldn't stop reading once I'd started. Polished off the whole book in a weekend! Gripping description of drowning -- what a horrible way to go.
3,"Dramatic story line, disappointing writing","An engaging story of human survival with less than polished writing. At times the books's focus wanders. Junger pads the central characters' stories with technical information and unrelated accounts of sea rescues that he fails to smoothly integrate. The fishermens' struggle--their dedication, desperation, and bonding--is brought to life, but with less than forceful writing. And as a second-hand account, the thoughts and motivations attributed to these characters is only conjecture. For true-life drama with the pace of a page-turning novel, I recommend the dual memoir: The Gulf Between Us, by Acree. Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air is another riveting first-person account."
3,Fishing- bad career choice,"Mostly a primer on why not to become a commercial fisherman (fisherperson?) Good, exciting story about rescuers, interesting storm stories. Loss of central characters remains a hazy mystery, sad tale indeed but not as good as the reviews. Not one page too short."
4,Puts reader in the shoes of sailors who died at sea.,"The author does a wonderful job of reassembling the events surrounding what was thought to be another trip to the Swordfishery off George's banks. Nobody survived that trip so the author must reconstruct everything by interviewing people with similar experiences and using his understanding of the personality of each sailor to figure out what they were thinking/doing during the deadly two weeks at sea in the North Atlantic. Good read with enough technical detail to entertain gearheads and enough personality to appeal to sensitive, people type persons. Not quite as good as Into Thin Air but very close."
3,"A good story, but...","Finding out what happens to the crew forced me to finish this book. Otherwise, the writing is tedious and the real life history of the people onboard is almost nonexistent."
4,GRIPPING,"Junger keeps you interested from page one. A detailed and riveting story that takes you along the ins and out of the sleepy town and the commercial fishing personalities that eventually put this town on the map.The education of the weather service, seamanship and Coast Guard was enlightning."
4,"Interesting, but overrated","The Perfect storm is an interesting story, but I found the writing to be less polished than I expected. The story seemed to wander and be padded in places with extra information that wasn't crucial to the story line. Also, I have to wonder about the accuracy since this is a second hand account. For a true life drama with action and adventure, drama and suspense, I recommend The Gulf Between Us: Love and Terror in Desert Storm, by the Acrees. An absolutely riveting story, great book."
3,Grim but apparently true,"This nonfiction thriller is a good summer read, if you're into disasters. Junger profiles the world of the fisherman with a storyteller's eye and a hint of sympathy. Tension rises as we follow the fate of two boats which get caught in a gale, with harrowing results. There are intervals of tedious scientific tangents about the weather, and none of the fisherman's lot would be cheerful stuff even without the disaster parts, but there are moments of real excitement here."
5,a perfect read,One of the most interesting and certainly one of the most compelling books to come along in quite some time. Catches your interest early and dosen't let go until the last page. one of those books you hate to see end.
4,Details,"I've never been a reader of true-life adventure books, but on a recommendation by my sister-in-law, I picked this one up. Junger has really done his homework. I now know more than I ever wanted to know about everything from the fishing industry in New England to meteorology to the physical effects of drowning. It's very good. Not only was I in awe of the work put in behind the scenes to produce this story, but the book's a page-turner - a well-written blend of the emotional and technical."
5,A vivid cliffhanger recolection of a real disaster at sea,"On October 1991 a tropical storm collided with another storm in northern USA and Canada. The effect was the creation of a monster ""Mother of All Storms"", which wreaked havoc in the North Atlantic. Sebastian Junger, a gifted journalist undertook the task to present us what happened to the lives of sailors, fishermen and heroic Coast Guard rescue pilots indelibly touched by this monster storm. Junger takes us step by step in the chronology of events as the storms unfolds its terrible power and introduces everyone touched by this disastrous event. You will get to know the lost fishermen of the ""Andrea Gail"" from Gloucester, Ma., their colleagues, relatives, girlfriends, and the people of Gloucester, Ma, and each one of the members in the rescue team of the Coast Guard.You will not be able to stop until you finish the book, undoubtedly one of the best in the last 20 years. You will not be disappointed, even if you saw the film..."
2,Completely Dated,"This would be a nice compilation of stories and anecdotes to read--if it were 1982. Reading it felt like I was being lectured by an old man in a nursing home telling me about how hard it was 'back in MY day'.I judge a book about the Appalachian Trail by whether or not it makes me want to go out and hike it. This one did no such thing. It felt like sitting around listening to a bunch of old George Carlin-types, without the wit or humor."
2,A history book- not a guide book. Misleading title and description.,"I think its misleading to call this an ""official guide"" to the AT. Its a fun expose on various aspects of AT culture and community.This is a nonfiction read that talks about the trail- yes- but if you're planning for an AT hike, you need to bring a guide book with you, and this isn't going to tell you how far you are from the next water source.Also, its outdated.Think about it. An entire CHAPTER named ""The Thing with Two Heads - Women and Couples on the Trail""?! Its almost like its a revolutionary thought that a female should hike it solo. I guess I found that a little insulting.While I recognize that this book has an audience of recreational readers and those who are not trying to gear up for their thruhike, I believe that consumers should be wary that the title and descriptions amazon gives us are misleading."
3,This book is an attempt to cover the history of the AT,"The book provides the reader with an overview of the historical aspects of the trail. The reader is introduced to the early politics of the trail, and the feats of its more colorful ""thru hickers"".The book does lack the personal flavor and overall adventure aspect of many other publications."
3,A fun attempt to showcase AT community,"I read this book before my 2000 AT thru-hike and found the use of trail names confusing and kind of silly. I still feel that way now.When I finished the trail I came back to this book and read the last chapter about adjusting to the real world. It really helped me cope with that difficult time when the daily endorphin rush ends, replaced by the confusion and noise of civilization.In the final analysis, Luxenbourg talked to hundreds of hikers and did his best to convey a sense of what it is like to thru-hike. He mostly succeeds. Because the chapters are arranged by topic, with nothing connecting them, it is a great book to keep in the bathroom or coffee table, to pick up and look through when, Midwest-bound in winter, one longs for the trail."
4,voice like a cello,"my nostalgia for eclectic lyrics was so satisfied with this album. A simmering intensity, shades of Bauhaus more melifluous than manic. Indigo Eyes is such a well crafted ballad - almost folky but Peter Murphy's voice saves it from that horror. I bought the CD for that song alone."
5,Passionate and Powerful,Love Hysteria was my first full-length Peter Murphy solo album. This was the first of Murphy's albums to feature Paul Statham as his main songwriting collaborator. Murphy also showed on L.H. that he could write just fine on his own with such timeless tracks as 'My Last Two Weeks'. This album runs the gamut from really rocking tunes like 'His Circle and Hers Meet' to spiritually indulgant rants such as 'Socrates Python'. This is also the first album just to feature Murphy's touring band which makes the album a bit more uniform than his first. Definately a must-have in my opinion.
3,Small groups made intimate,"This is a great book if you have a small group, say 5 or 6, and are doing this for a church function. It had great ideas, but I could not use it because my group was larger, and not all christians. I needed something a little more general."
3,Lots of great ideas but too church-oriented.,"It has many icebreaking activities but was simply too church-oriented for me to use it at all since I deal with school and secular groups primarily. It would be a lot of work to remove all the religious references. And many of the activities seem to be repeats from many other books I've read. Not as innovative as it ought to be. Since people attend lots of meetings, you've got to have new activities in order to keep them from being bored.Still, if it had been titled with ""for Church Group leaders"" it'd be a great resource."
1,So religious I couldn't use it,"I bought this book for a team-building at work, and was very disappointed because 95% of the suggestions were based on religion. The other 5% was not even worthy of suggesting to the group because it wasn't creative as I would have liked it to be, for adults."
4,this is the best old school rap i have heard in a long time,i loved this cd so much i can really relate to it it is also the best old school rao i have ever heard and the beats are phat!!!!!!
5,THIS IS THE TIGHTEST CD OUT!!!!! BUY IT Y'ALL!!!!!,"This is a tight follow up album to Illadelph especially with the single ""You Got Me""featuring Erykah Badu and Eve of Destruction. Y'all got to add this CD to your collection and also the first two if you don't already have them."
5,Hip-Hop in it's truest form,"The Roots are a rarity in music today. They have managed to maintain a sizable audience among hip-hop fans, as well as gaining respect from fans of other musical categories. They have managed to avoid the superficial overtones that plague rap music today. ""Things Fall Apart"" is the fourth in a series of masterpieces by The Roots. The Roots keep it real, and keep on getting better"
5,All Time GREATEST!!,I can still listen to every song on this cd and still rock to it to this day! The best of them all.
3,Good...But Not Great.,"Being a long time Roots fan, this album was more of a dissapointment than the hip-hop gem that it was hyped up to be. Sure, some of the tracks are smokin' and definetly represent some of their best work, however, the rest (about half) of the tracks are a let down compared to previous albums. The Roots 2nd album, ""Do You Want More?"", showed that they posess more originality than any other hip-hop band out there. Two projects later, that originality is running out. Many cuts sound as if they went into the vaults and ripped off as many A Tribe Called Quest's beats as they could afford to without changing their name to A Tribe Called Quest. Whack lyrics from some of the ""special guests"" fill the album with clutter that could be replaced with what I bought it for...to hear The Roots. Don't get me wrong, If you're down with The Roots, get this album. Just don't expect to be blown away. Things Fall Apart...how true."
3,"good, but if not a tad over rated...","I respect these guys for using real instruments and being a rap group that has actual talent in a world of senseless, brainless pop pap. But the major flaw i found with this CD is the lack of creativity. There wasnt much to keep my attention on the CD, as most of the songs sounded very alike after many repeated listens. There arent a lot of hooks or choruses or anything on this CD, just plain jamming. Maybe you have to be a really true hip hop fan to like this. I love outkast and cee-lo to death, but maybe im just not in for this kind of rapping. Theyve got a whole band here, why just use the drums and rapping, when you could put more bass, guitar, and keyboard into it? Its kind of cool how all the songs run into eachother... each track starts with the end of the previous track. I really like their other CD's, ""Do you want more?!?!?!"" and ""Illadelph Halflife"", but this one doenst do it for me that much."
5,roots crew,this by far there best work to date everything before this was also classcial work from the group but I'm whating on the new joint thing fall apart was fire the whole ablum
4,Lames Fell Apart,"Don't confuse the title of my review with the review itself. Things Fall Apart is another well crafted Roots gem that has original instrumentation, tight lyrics & thoughtful concepts. It's a reason why The Roots during their concerts perform a song called ""Hip-Hop 101"" because a lot of these fraud emcees need a crash course in the art. Things Fall Apart doesn't need to be broken down because the 4 or 5 star ratings speak for themselves. And for the clowns who rated this tight cd 3 stars or lower, well, the title of my review describes you best."
5,Amazing,"Things Fall Apart is a fantastic album, their best in my opinion, musically speaking at least. It is rare that a group can compose songs that impose a deep connection between you and the music, even if there were no lyrics at all. It is just a superb album, all around. I couldn't be happier that I own a copy."
5,'falls apart' comes together...,"this is proly one of the most complete of all hip hop albums ever made. the production is realreal good and they spit some pretty tight lyrics...but its all just so damn consistant and doesnt really stray away into anything that takes away from it.a very solid release that will be hard for them to follow up on, but with ?uestlove off venturing into various projects right now...you never know, they might live up to the challenge....i'll be waitin, fa'sho."
4,"4 stars, you all just give anybody 5 stars","The Roots are dope everybody knows that. This album is real good in comparision to 90% of hip hop albums but I also think the previous 2 were better. I bought this, Eminem, DJ Quik and Prince Paul the same day. I think this is the second best out of the bunch behind Eminem. That is a hip hop classic. This is close though and mosdef worth your 15 bones or whatever."
5,Unbelievable,"The Roots bounce back to top form with ""Things Fall Apart."" Too bad that their plan for five different endings ended up on the cutting room floor of the label. Instead the fans are left with the impossible choice of having to try to choose between five different covers, which all hold to the title of the album. If you like the Roots get this, if you are unsure let this decide for you. With 1999 already a strong year in hip-hop music, the Roots upped the ante for future releases. Thank you for returning to the basics, the live sound is what the Roots are all about. Check them live in concert for a blazing show and unsurpassed professionalism. You have just been blessed by the legendary foundation known as the Roots."
5,THE SQUARE ROOTS!,"One of thier best works. Get this album and then get EVERY roots album. I don't care how you found the roots, but keep them. They are a true jewel in a world of banality."
3,Ambitious but overrated,"The Roots are full of good ideas-- and some of them are very well realized. But they have two major flaws: their music is rarely as creative or well-played as it ought to be, the keyboard parts in particular; and their primary MC, Black Thought, is kind of monotonous. With the Roots, the concept has always impressed me a bit more than the finished result."
2,Great instrumental work in an album otherwise spoiled by Black Thought's aggressive tone of voice,"Don't get me wrong, I won't try to deny the quality of the jazzy artistry behind every track on ""Things Fall Apart"".What I don't think fits in with what people appreciate in A Tribe, Quasimoto, Pete Philly and Perquisite, Kero One and other rappers/rap acts who make use of jazz is Black Thought's aggressive tone of voice.IMO it spoils this record. I only enjoyed about 4 tracks in total, like ""You Got Me"", where Erykah Badu perhaps had the effect of making BT tone down his aggressive tone to a more listenable one.It's a pity (though I can understand him to be frustrated as someone who is conscious of past racism and the black cause) that he has this particularly annoying tone of voice, that whilst not as bad as Canibus', is still sufficiently misplaced that it spoils things for me.Anyway that's why I give it 2.5/5."
2,Let Down,"This album I am sorry to say is a disappointment. Unworthy to follow up illadelph halflife. The best song is ""You got me"" and maybe two other songs are worth mentioning but I want. The lyrics may have been tight but the music lacks luster. Mundane is a good word to describe the album because there is no energy/excitement in the beats. Great music to go to sleep in the car on.Peace, T-Dawg Atlanta,GA"
5,one of hip hops best contributions to the culture.,"the album speaks for itself. lyrics and all, the hip hop\rhythm and blues vibe is given and that's what is suppose to be taken in. the roots are notorious for having a straight forward feel to their music and a ""mellow-my-man,"" kinda jazz tip! for those who like that cool, chill and relaxin', but with a little touch of ""out of this world,"" style, then you will love this roots album. it's tight! go get it.ro"
5,A Masterpiece,"I enjoyed previous albums from the Roots, but always it was my admiration for them that surpassed my actual enjoyment of their records. Not here...they finally unlock their full potential here with an amazing set of songs, infectious jazzy grooves and very tight rhymes."
5,THIS JOINT WAS PHAT.,"This is one of the best CD's that I've heard in a long time. The Roots and Erykah Badu sound great together in ""You Got Me."" This CD is a lot better Silkk's ""Made Man"" but not as good C-Murder's ""Bosaline."" This is the CD to buy if you're looking for hip-hop."
5,STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART,"IT IS MUSIC LIKE THIS THAT MAKES US NOT FORGET WHERE WE CAME FROM.THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER GROUP WITH MEANINGLESS LYRICS,THE BROTHERS SPEAK STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART.I WAS NEVER A FAN OF HIP-HOP,BUT I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS GROUP IS THE ONE THAT MADE ME CHANGE MY WAYS.ROOTS IS A REAL AFRICAN AMERICAN GROUP WHICH KNOW THEIR ROOTS.THEIR MESSAGE CROSSES ALL ACROSS THE SEA TO SOUTH AFRICA.THIS SHOWS JUST HOW POWERFUL THIS GROUP REALLY IS.I'M VERY PROUD OF THEM AS IF THEY ARE MY BLOOD BROTHERS.I MEAN IT.DON'T GIVE UP."
5,The Roots dont fall apart on this album,"Black Thought, Scratch, Hub, Rahzel, and everyone else is back on the Roots' 3rd LP, ""Things Fall Apart"". This is the best mix of hip hop out there, with jazz-influenced tracks, a Jazzy Jeff DJ track, and arguably the best bass notes and instruments around. The instruments on ""Step into the Relm"" and ""Double Trouble"" are unbelievably original! ""You Got Me"" is a great single, and ""Act Too"" is an almost a cappela sounding piece right at the beginning and for a short time in the middle. The only down side is the poem written by Ursula Rucker to finish the album. I just wasnt feeling that. Still, this album is one of the best of the decade, and possibly in the history of the genre. Peace out."
4,There isn't much more to say,"I hadn't heard much of the roots before this cd, but now they have turned into one of my favorite groups. From the great beatboxin on adrenaline, to the mellowed out love of my life, this cd is classic. No other rappers could ever sound this good with electronics, and they do it all naturally. On top of all of that, black thoughts lyrics are razor sharp and very easy to listen to."
5,Pure Hip-Hop Genius,"With their fourth release, the Roots have proven again their supreme rank in the hip-hop community. Thought (no pun intended) provoking lyrics coupled with masterful beats defintely make this release the best of 1999- bar none! If you don't feel me- check out Act Too- The Love of My Life and see how Black Thought and Common check hip-hop imposters. After hearing this album, the Roots make it painfully obvious to hip-hop flunkies that they will never be able to do ""What They Do."""
5,Seriously....,"This album is definitely not as good as either illadelph or DYWM. And it really doesn't matter. It's still the greatest group in hip hop today and it's better than anything else out now except a few of the better underground groups. It seems like everybody loves ""you got me"" but everybody's sleepin on the REAL ish. The best song on this album is either ""dynamite"" or ""adrenaline."" Actually, no. Anything with Dice Raw is great, and he owns every track he rhymes on. Just check his second verse on ""don't see us."" he's all over the place. Seriously, this album takes a little time to grow on you but it's still incredible. But pay attention and don't just put the Badu jawn on repeat."
5,Plant The Roots Of Originality,Other groups should take a lesson from these cats as far making original music. Original beats are a missing ingredient in hip hop and most r&b these days and it is going to be what sets apart the crap from quality.........
1,This has got to be the worst CD ever!,"The Roots music video/song is horrible! They can't rap, or write good lyrics! Their songs are long and monotonous. I am glad I burned my copy!"
1,Wack,"Sorry but this is a WACK album. Very boring...it's one of those ""Let me expand your mind"" albums...which makes it boring instantly. Avoid please."
5,The Roots - keeping it real,"The Roots prove that they are still on top of the hiphop world. After listening the advance copy of ""Things Fall Apart"" - I can safely say that this album is just as good as ""Organix"", ""Do You Want More"", and ""Illadelph Halflife"". My favorite cuts on the album are ""Next Movement"", ""Double Trouble"" , ""Adrenaline"", and a few more. It also features Mos Def, Common, DiceRaw (the corner store terrorist), Erykah Badu, and a few more. Please buy this album and support one of the best hiphop groups of all time. They deserve some loot!"
2,"Only contains two episodes, both found in earlier DVD collections","As a previous reviewer has mentioned, ""Dance of Friendship"" contains two Angelina episodes contained on earlier DVDs - ""Angelina and Anya"" is found on ""Angelina Ballerina: The Lucky Penny"" and ""Alice's Present"" is found on ""Angelina Ballerina: Friends Forever"". Also, most of the other Angelina Ballerina DVDs contain 4 episodes, but this particular DVD only has 2. My advice: skip this DVD, and get the others with 4 episodes."
3,Needed an half star...classic,I got so caught up with it in the bathroom that I mistakenly used it as toilet paper..so I back for a new book...It was classic.....
3,An actual review of the actual book.,"I don't listen to the radio show and don't watch the television program, but Kornheiser's still a pretty decent gag writer. Deliberately absurd, often repetitive, Kornheiser milks his best lines two, three times over. That said, he's more creative and the subject matter contained within is broader than most ""best of"" books."
5,You need this book!,"Tony's new book is so epic....errrr....I mean classic! It has to be, everything he has written is back for a second time. This book is a true retread. How classic is that!I mean, what does this guy do? He goes and takes everything he has written for the Washington Post and repackages it again for even more duckets.That's just sick.Memo to Tony. Get off the type-writer. Quit banging on those dusty keys! We only want to read what you've already written.Ante up everyone. Don't give Tony a chance to write more columns, otherwise you'll be left behind. Rack'em before you get racked!"
5,Great Book,"I'm a regular listener to Tony's radio show in Washington DC so I already knew I would like his book. There are some parts of the books that contains articles that are a little boring. BUT, Tony is a great writer and the book will keep you interested."
4,BEWARE OF THE BLUE BALL!!!!,"I was at my local borders bookstore looking for this book but noticed that it was not in stock. From out of nowhere, an orange faced cape-wearing bald man appeared and saw me on the wing going to the counter to ask for help regarding the book. Screaming out of his cape came a behind-the-back pass of the book that landed softly in my well-manicured right hand. I easily laid the book up on the counter and paid for it with the greatest of ease. As I was exiting out of the book store, I pointed at the caped curmudgeon --- AFFIRMATION!!!!"
1,This book STINKS.......Andy Polley: STINKS!!!!!,You can read every single one of these columns on the Washington Post's website. And most aren't really that funny anyway. So don't waste your money!!
1,A Third-Rate Collection from a Third-Rate Columnist,"This ""book"" is a collection of newspaper columns that appeared in the Washington Post over the past few years. As a long-time subscriber to the Washington Post, I've probably read most of them.Tony Kornheiser has whined for many years about not winning the Pulitzer Prize for columnists, conveniently ignoring the main reason for his not winning: He is not very good.Sure, he gets off a funny one-liner every now and again, but his whiny, complaining, ""you're not smart-and I'm am"" game gets very tiring very quickly. I'd save my money on this one."
5,This Book Stinks,Tony Kornheiser is one of the funniest men alive. It was great to be able to read his non-sports collumns. This book really shows his versatility
5,"Wow, with Linda Cohn and Mike Wilbon","Hey, this is pretty cool... I'm a big fan of PTI but I haven't purchased this book because you have enough money already probably. Barry Bonds is not on steroids."
4,Essentials of Mercedes Benz SL average,"Laurence Meredith's technical review of the 190SL and Pagoda Benz models is very good in what in presents, yet falls short in the detail I was expecting. This series is good for a Mercedes novice, but offers little detail about the insides of these models and what makes them unique and different. The book is awash with wonderful color pictures, and serves up correct statistics regarding the technical specifications. Perhaps I am just disappointed in that I was expecting more tips and details about restoring these cars. Information is both accurate and complete, and well presented."
3,"Lots of info, but mostly for European practitioners","This book is a good resource for public relations students and practitioners. Nearly every aspect of the business is covered in under 150 pages. Readers are given tips on how to approach different stages in one's career--from getting your foot in the door to freelancing to specializing in an established position. My only complaint is that a significant portion of each section deals with how PR is done in Europe. For American readers, most of this is just not applicable. Overall: a good guide and worth the money, just be aware of the audience for which it is written."
4,worth getting......but.,"i do like this. johnny keeps his mouth shut and plays his guitar---really well in fact. guess jerry had a 'talk' with him.ths sound is great too, and though the visuals are not as good as the 'DOA' dvd, at least the sound isn't dubbed (wtf?)!!!but still---something is missing--johnny is a shadow of his former self. anyone who wants to witness the power and glory of the HEARTBREAKERS at their wild, energetic peak---when they ruled nyc ( really ) should search out one of the Max's Kansas City bootlegs--you know where to find them.ps---too bad the crowd shots are mostly clueless fratboys on the side--when the cam cuts to the main crowd they are very animated.especially that guy that looks like Pablo Escobar! maybe it was him ha ha!"
5,The best!!!!!!,The best Johnny Thunders video out there! Hes in top form here! The great sound quality makes up for the lack of video quality ( a bit fuzzy and its from one camera). I own the other two dvds (Cold Blood and Dead Or Alive) and this kills both of them. Hes hittin' all the right notes (and words) and just boppin' all over the stage! Great performance!
4,"Great concert, a must have.","This was a great buy, ill never get tired of watching this. A great set list, footage quality is ok for the late 80's. All in all if your a Dolls fan or a Thunders fan this will not dissapoint. Must say its great to see that more than half of the dolls original line up is back together for this show."
4,Good but outdated,"The authors take 15 current trends and predict that they will be our 15 future trends. Not too earth shattering. But it is helpful to have a full compilation of their predictions. And the book can be read quickly because you only have to scan every other word. However because of its publication date recent major political and economic disturbances such as September 11, Enron, WorldCom, and the stock market melancholy (although with some recent up trending) of the last few years that have dramatically reshaped the world's landscape are missing. Therefore the authors' trends must be re-assessed in the light of these events. For instance, one trend (number 8) refers to the ""mushrooming of paper millionaires"". Well?"
3,"A lotta good, a lotta bad","The initial concept of this book is good. In fact, it is what arcane magic should. Loose form, free-fitting. teh book tells you how to on-the-fly crat your own speels whenevber you wish for your character, and how to know how powerful the spell is and how difficult it will be to cast.However, the drawbacks required for the system is just too porhibited. It's difficult enough to cast the spells as it were. When they force you to use the drawbacks, it suddenly becomes not worth it.The best use of this book is to run a Mage: the Ascension type campaign using d20 rules as its base. Just import the paradox rules from there to the spellcrafting in this book, and you may have something. But that is an awful lot of work."
3,Plastic blender jar,"Made my order from Germany to my sister in California. So I could not put in my review til I recieved it. The jar was delivered quite promptly, to my sister was very good packaging. Which was good cause it made its way to Europe. Haven't tried it out though, cause it is destined to travel a bit longer. Goodmans is Good."
1,didnt fit,"This plastic container is the proper one for my blender, but the fit leaked so badly I had to give the blender away to the thrift store"
3,Basketball primer,"Unlike some people, I was not a basketball aficionado until circumstances forced me to stay awake at the games. The Mom's Guide to Basketball is small so I can sneak looks at it during the game, concise so I don't have to hunt around for the term I'm looking for and complete to the point where I don't have to ask what the boys did every time they do something. It would now be helpful if mom could do a guide to understanding refs who make bad calls."
2,Too Eastcoast for me,Foe sounds too much like a eastcoast rapper and doesn't rap Black Market Style. Sounds like Homicides old stuff.
5,Alex Klein Oboe Concerti,"I have this on cassette which I nearly stretched out within the first couple months after purchase.This music is just great. Anyone who enjoys Vivaldi, or baroque/classical, will LOVE this."
4,"Good, but can be much better!","I decided to get this book as it seemed to be the only one on the market that targeted the 3 exams I wanted to take. I am happy to say I passed all three exams (first-time around) using the book, AND the designer help database. I recommend buying this book if you've not taken any courses or don't know what might be on the exam.However there were so many errors, typos e.g. Design Locking and Document locking were mixed up, sometimes the wrong diagram was being displayed for the section; I became somewhat distrustful so I used the designer help database extensively to confirm what I was reading! (That probably made me better prepared for the exam)Make sure you also get hands-on experience!!!"
1,"Where's ""Message to Love""?","They left off ""Message to Love""! It's hard to believe... This song is available on the original release 'Band of Gypsies'. Why not here? Simple! They spect the fans to buy both. What a shame!"
4,Live at the Fillmore East,"This is one of the albums my brother and I have been waiting for since the 1970's, the lost works from the Fillmore East, 1969/70. The pieces are obviously not as polished and solid as the Band of Gypsies album, since Hendrix himself chose the best for the original album. However, we are exposed to new sounds and experimentations, and this is what made Hendrix the best. The background of Billy Cox and Buddy Miles definitely sets the mood. The sound quality is quite good for a live album since it was mixed by Eddie Kramer; compare it to Hendrix at Woodstock and you'll notice quite a difference in presence. This is classic Hendrix live, but only for fans who understand what he is doing."
3,Bootleggers are happy,"This is why Hendrix fans are forced to turn to bootleggers and those people get rich. You want to hear to the full, unedited performances of Hendrix at the Fillomre east? Easy, go get the bootlegs. If you want an artifical, bad sequenced, edited performance, get the official release. Experience Hendrix has mostly issued great CD's by Hendrix, but this is an exemption. When Hendirx was here, HE decided to edit some tracks and release a partial performance as Band of Gypsis. That is fine, HE was the artist and we all love and cherish that album. But now that he is gone, NOBODY can make such decisions. So the only right thing to do is release those recordings as they were recorded. Dont get creative people, remember Alan Douglas and all the hell Hendrix fans had to take for 20 years."
3,If only the estate were as good as Jimi!,"After a friend demanded that I buy only one Hendrix album (this was a while ago before cds), Are You Experienced, another friend told me that Band of Gypsies was Hendrix at his peak live. I bought the record and was convinced. Years later, I tracked down the cd, which was an import, that has 3 songs that never appeared on any domestic vinyl or cd release of the single disc edition. To this day, one of those 3 bonus tracks has ever been offically released in the US. As a owner of all 4 shows from the Filmore EAst, I can tell you that it's a shame and a crime to watch material trickle out and premium dollar. Yeah, this set rocks. But what waits in the vaults would really amaze."
4,GREAT LIVE HENDRIX,"This CD is taken from a series of concerts over a few days at the Fillmore East in NYC back in '70, right before Jimi died and the Fillmore closed. As usual, the vocals are terrible but who cares, there's Jimi doing his thing on the guitar better than anyone ever did it before or after. And while I am not a real big fan of Buddy Miles, he holds up and Billy Cox, the bass player who was Jimi's friend from the Army, is great. Not his best live CD, but not his worst, either. My favorite one is still ""In The West"", that one gets five stars instead of four. But I guarantee that this CD will have you playing the air guitar."
3,Let him rest in peace!!,"First let me say I love Jimi Hendrix and his music. I think he was one of the best guitarists in the world. Hear we find yet another Jimi Hendrix CD in the stores. Jimi's family is putting an album out every year and don't care at what cost to his fans or music!! What is next, Jimi live from his bathroom (the lost tapes:( ) Buy all the must have studio albums and a few live ones, but don't waste your money or time trying to get the same songs over and over again under diffrent album titles. Let Jimi rest in peace for him and his fans!! Only reason I give it 3 stars is because its Jimi and I respect what he has done."
2,Less than first rate effort,"Band of Gypseys was formed because of 1)a contractual problem Hendrix had and 2)a desire to broaden Hendrix's appeal with the black crowd. This recording has numerous examples of inadvertent tempo changes and playing that's off-key. Buddy Miles ain't no Mitch Mitchell. This is not Hendrix at this best. His best live recording is the album titled, ""Hendrix in the West."" It's not in CD format. His playing on that album is blistering and a clear measure of how far off the Fillmore East concerts are."
3,Jimi picked the original Band of Gypsies material himself.,"Jimi Hendrix was ALIVE when the original Band Of Gypsies album was released in 1970. He picked the best tracks and helped in the mixing. Almost 30 years later we get the second and third best takes from the four concerts of Dec 31,1969-Jan.1,1970. For Hendrix completists only.(I'm one.)"
5,Magic,"Ian is absolutely correct in every word. Will take you to another place. Deserves more than 5 stars, Band of Gypsys don't get their due."
5,Jimi's Greatest Performances,"His four shows at the Fillmore East, parts captured on this release, were IMHO Jimi's best ever. He is rejuvenated after weeks of jammin and finding where he wanted to go post-Experience. Jimi's guitar work, riffs and solos are beautiful. I read another review criticizing the sound quality. I disagree. I have not noticed a difference between this and the BOG release and believe that Eddie Kramer did a wonderful job at making these 30-year old recordings sound as good as they do. Hendrix's Band of Gypsies is hardly like his Experience, but I believe the BOG is much better. It sounds much more experienced (pun intended) and music-oriented rather than using gimmicks to make it a great show (playing behind his back, etc.) A must have for any Hendrix fan, or any rock fan in general. The guitar work is incredible. I wish I could give it 10 stars."
4,Stay away if you're looking for the hits!,"Funky, fatback grooves and spaced out guitar work make up this two cd set. Billy Cox and Buddy Miles are whole different ball of wax compared to Jimi's Experience bandmates. They lay down relentless pockets of rhythmn as a foundation, and as such Hendrix has the room he needs to soar. Basically a masterful blowing session, songs take a back seat to soul covers, works in progress and assorted jamming vehicles. Despite the limited repertoire, (which Jimi acknowledges at the end of one track) the feel is loose and liberated and Hendrix hits Owsley-inspired heights on Stone Free, Machine Gun (twice) and Hear My Train A Comin'. A welcome addition to the Hendrix catalog, here's hoping there's more good stuff where this came from."
3,Less Than Killer,"Remember the original 1970 release ""Band of Gypsies""? I certainly do. I have both that and ""Live at the Filmore East"" on CD now, and I must say that after listening to the strong energy that shined through on the original LP, I found much of it was lost on this album. ""Who Knows,"" for instance, is less than 4 minutes in length. It's no longer the 9 and a half minute killer that it was on the original LP. And that one had lyrics! Jimi Hendrix was a good guitar player, and ""Band of Gypsies"" contained the best material recorded over two nights at the Filmore East. This album contains alternate versions and additional songs, which I usually enjoy, but in this case the unused clips should have stayed unused. I guess sometimes, you gotta know when to quit."
5,The best,"My favorite Jimi album. This is the best example of the astounding abilities of Jimi. With Billy Cox really holding the groove, Jimi has less of an obligation to play rhythm, and he flies everywhere. There's an odd fluff here or there, but this CD is the supreme example of Jimi Hendrix in his element--live. Most highly reccomended."
3,Its okay,This particular book is simply basic information about the use of assessments and how they inform the counseling and therapy field. Its okay for that. But I didn't find it very useful.
3,All Truths,I think the Family Assessment Handbook was helpful for the class.Family Assessment Handbook: An Introductory Practice Guide to Family Assessment
4,The Fictional Diary of a Real Stowaway,"Nicholas Young just had to get away from his family and the man he worked for, the butcher.He stole money from the butcher and ran away.In the summer of 1768 he became a stowaway aboard the Endeavour. The ship left London and Nick was gracious. It wasn't the perfect life that Nick bargained for however. The mean Mr.Bootie wasn't soft hearted towards Nick at all. Nicholas had to learn to live for himself. He became more tough and learned that running away from his troubles wasn't going to solve anything. He met new friends and met the Natives of many lands. This fictional diary tells of the adventure of Nicholas Young during his 3 year voyage aboard the Endeavour where he visited some of the most fascinating new lands of his time."
5,Great book!,"I thought very highly of this book. The content is exceptionally realistic, accurately describing sailing on an eighteenth-century ship. Stowaway is set in the 1700s and is about a boy named Nicholas Young. Tormented by his master, her runs away. Stowing away aboard the HMS Endeavour, the eleven-year-old Nicholas has to face many perils in unexplored lands, such as an island full of cannibals, perilous coral reefs, torrential storms, kidnapping, and a tropical port rife with deadly sickness. I enjoyed this book a great deal and would recommend it to anyone who loves history or adventure."
5,stowaway,"Stowaway by Karen Hesse is a great book about a boy that is a stowaway on a ship.Nick,go's to many different islands and soon meets a native american boy they become very good friends and he gets to go on the voyage with Nick.But everybody comes down with bloodly flux while Nick takes care of the sick seamen people die one by one out of 80 seamen 8 are left!"
3,Comment,"In this book, it is kind of unbelievable that an eleven-year-old boy would have such a big diary. 301 pages written by a single boy. The detail was unnecessary and boring. If nothing remotely interesting happened on a certain day, there is no use wasting my time and writing it down. To make it more realistic, add spelling errors and skip a day or two. Don't write something not related to the main plot of the story."
2,Teachers...this is a bad choice for summer reading,"During my summer holiday, I, an incoming freshman, was forced to read Stowaway. Please choose age appropriate books. It seems to me that these selections are not always carefully made. I would much rather be reading Dickens or Hemingway than reading a diary-like book filled with ""adventurous little boys""."
2,This Book Was Mediocre,"I read the book Stowaway and it wasn't particularly good. It began with a boy named Nick Young. He snuck onto the ship Endeavor and hid in the pinnace for a while. It might have been a better book if he wasn't found hiding in Chapter 2 or what have you. All I can say is the book was boring and repetitive. The crew met natives, traded with natives, befriended natives, killed natives etc.Don't get me wrong some parts were exciting, but there wasn't much action. If there was sword fighting and pirates, it would be a much better book. There was quite a bit of death which I didn't like to much.The book had no fantasy, not one bit, but you might like it if you like fancy ship talk and boats. I wouldn't recommend it. It did win an award but I wouldn't have given it one. It didn't deserve it.(...)"
4,Stowin' with the flowin',"I recommend this book to any diligent reader who wants a good book, or should I say novel, to pass the time. I would particularly recommend this book to all kids over the age of 11; I only say this because it is hard to understand it occasionally. This book taught me a valuable lesson. I learned that if I'm not happy with me life I should change it to hat I want to do. Nick showed me that following your heart can not only make you happy but also can make history like Nick. If Nick hadn't changed his life he would probably still be a butchers apprentice. Every entry Nick wrote had a different challenge that kept me and other readers divided"
4,review on stowaway,The author of stowaway is Karen Hesse. The book is a historical fiction.The plot of this book is the voyage on Endeavor and all its hardships Nick Young faces. Nick stows away in the pinnance along Endeavor he paid three men to get him aboard. Nick visits many new lands and even an island named after him he makes new friends and enemies.He also sees many of his friends die aboard the ship but learns to cope with them.I think this book is very good. Ithought it was very informational and fun. Ithink this book is suited for people who like long books and adventure.The bok also explains what a sialors had to go through in the sea life. People who like baots and traveling should read this book.
2,Terrible,This book is terrible i read the first 200 pages then quit because of how boring it was. journals aren't cool when they're told like that.
3,Pretty well written Karen,"This book is really good, it has some tough parts that are hard to get over kinda near the end. Stowaway has a great story and is very detailed. It has some extreme parts like lashes, beatings and such so I would recommend this book for ages 6 or 7 and up.If I would have written this book though I might have added a bit more shooting and action. It has good word chioces and I hope you choose to read it too."
5,Very satisfyed,I have use this spryer to remove mold after flood and was surprised how flawless it worked. I am very happy with the results
3,Too Small,I like these patches. Very thin but strong material. I agree with other reviewers that they are smaller than needed. I use the .38-.45 size patches all the time for my .22 and prefer the larger size. They will fit the .22 cal barrel no problem.
4,Expectations met,"I purchased these to save time trimming down my regular cleaning patches. These patches are clean without dust, debris and exactly as described."
3,You can do better,"These are okay. There is a tendency for the patches to shred and to leave particles in the gun. The patches do not all do this, but enough to be a problem. Okay product, but I will not buy these patches again."
2,Just not very exciting,"OK right off the bat i'll get the good out of the way. There is a lot of pretty imagery. Now for the bad, and there is pleanty of it. The most annoying feature for me (other than the poor transfer quality...call me spoiled by DVD) was the constand barrage of Titles. Unlike Baraka or Chronos, there were titles every 3-7 minutes that really broke the spell that the images can supply. On top of that the music accompanyment is awful. And the worst sin is the constant repitition of cities and images. There was little flow to this video, and overall I would not reccomend it to those seeking something similar in the Baraka genre'."
2,The Edited For TV Version,Would have been alot better if this wasnt the EDITED FOR TV VERSION. Received this with a large TV VERSION sticker on it.
5,Five By Five,"I must say that I loved this book. It was great to have an entire book dedicated to the wild slayer named Faith. Even though the cover says ""Faith, Hope, and Trick,"" ""Bad Girls,"" ""Enemies,"" and ""Consequences,"" it has ""Revelations"" instead of ""Enemies."" Either way, the book still would have been a great read. In ""Faith, Hope, and Trick,"" Faith, the new slayer is introduced and Buffy becomes a little jealous. In ""Revelations,"" Faith gets a new watcher who seems much like a watcher, only to find she has a secret plan of her own. ""Bad Girls"" is where Faith starts closely moving to the dark side by accidentally mistaking a human for a vampire and killin him, only to have no remorse. ""Consequences"" is about both Faith and Buffy dealing with the death of the Deputy Mayor...even though they each have a different way of going about it. Overall, it is a great book and a must-have for any Buffy fan."
4,A More Internal Perspective.....................,"These novelizations of three of the television episodes from the third Buffy season featuring Faith are solid; we get a little more of Faith's perspective and experience, how these stories and events had an impact on her on a personal level. It's a good read, not a necessity, but enjoyable nonetheless."
4,Focusing on Faith,"I read The Faith Trials, Vol. 1 (is there going to be a volume 2?) from the library, and it's an awesome book! James Laurence really knows how to make you think of the episodes he's writing about, and I think that's great, seeing as Buffy is now over. There's something about the character that is so likable---I think it's the way she's so reckless and such a change from Buffy. Laurence really well portrays her character. I agree with what someone said about how I wish they actually showed Faith's thoughts. But still, it was a really great read.Another reason why I liked this book is Laurence's language. I already said it and I'm going to say it again. He really does give life to the episodes he's talking about. Quotes are almost as enjoyable in the book as they are in the episodes on the screen themselves. (e.g. ""So what, you just fell, and tripped on his lips?""---Xander."
5,five by five book!,"may i say im a huge buffy fan and a huge faith fan and i love the character so when i heard this book was out i rushed out and bought it.i read it the day i got it and i loved it!Good episodes,even tho it says enemies and u get revelaitions instead,for this is not a bad thing.But a v.enjoyable read and i recommend this to any buffy fan and non-buffy fani give this 5 stars"
3,Tibet travel bible,"Tibet Overland: A Route and Planning Guide for Mountain Bikers and Other Overlanders (Traliblazer Guides)This book is THE bible for the independent traveller in Tibet. Although it is geared towards cyclists it would be useful to people traveling by other means. However, a WARNING - The current edition is 2002 and much has changed since then: Some of the dirt tracks in the book are now paved, which makes things easier (but less interesting). However, sometimes the book tells you there is food or accommodation available when it is not, and it is risky to rely on this information. Take a tent and spare food at all times."
2,"A great idea for a book, but now way too out of date.","I used Tibet Overland for a cycling trip in the summer of 2009 from Xining to Golmud to Lhasa, then a side trip to Ganden. So much has changed in China and Tibet since publication of this book that I cannot recommend it. Also some of the descriptions were way off, such as ""desolate"" for the expansive high grasslands of southern Qinghai Province; I found this countryside very beautiful. The book is worth a look if you happen to come across one, but it's no longer worth purchasing. Instead look for recently published books on the region and search online cycling and Tibet forums."
5,Excellent.,Hard to get over the counter. Works great. Put a drop on each ear before putting on hearing aids. Good.
5,Advanced Perspective Related to Back Pain,This text represents a remarkable contribution to spinal care. The authors provide an advanced perspective related to back pain that is comprehensive and relevant. It is a terrific addition to my libary.
5,easy to follow recipes. real food proven by Magnolias Restau,"Great book! The first real cookbook to come from any of the Charleston area Restaurants. Beautiful photographs and makes a great gift, especially for those who have eaten or have been to the famous Magnolias."
1,toy gins,when i recived this it was late getting here then it was broken and they put us threw hoops to return it it was so difficult to return we ended up just keeping it and are out alot of money.
2,Don't expect the usual Merchant-Ivory quality!,"This movie has a low-budget, homemade feel to it. I guess it was one of their very first films. It's in black and white and the sound quality is so poor that sometimes it's difficult to understand what the characters are saying. The Indian background music is often shrill and jarring, like fingernails on a blackboard. Also, the acting seemed pretty amateurish to me. The story is quite slow, too, and for me it dragged a bit. I would say this is only for the SERIOUS Merchant-Ivory scholar!"
2,Eh,"This tea was okay, but not really as fruity as I thought it was going to be. One thing I didn't really like about it was that it has an extremely slimey texture to it when I drank it. It has a lot of herbal goodness, but I won't be purchasing it again."
1,Ezonics Cam Ez-612,Cam worked well but the cam arm broke off from the base. Not the best designed model.
4,A sort of Bittersweet tale,"I like the cover of this book quite a bit as the snow has some glitter built into it. Its a Russian tale, of the Snow Princess, her father is the winter her mother is essentially the spring. She is happy and lovely--except she is curious about the world she lives in. So her parents give her permission to explore the world, with one warning. If love touches her heart she shall become mortal and die.We know where this is going.My only problem is that, while the guy is perfectly nice he is shown really earning her sacrafice. I think he should have done something for her besides get nearly frozen to death. (which wasn't even for her, it was for a lost sheep!)Aside from my little character development problem, I love the illustrations and the story as a whole is very nice."
2,Not very sturdy,They are advertised as being light which does not make them feel sturdy. I kept mine but would not buy more.
2,"SImple plane shelf, wrong descriptions, mis-leading.","I bought this shelf to go beside my bed, for my bedtime DVD's. The description clearly says it's made to fit DVD's. When you put the shelf in, you can't fit a DVD on it, and it's twice the depth of a DVD case. It's mis-leading. I have the middle shelf free-floating, sitting on a few empty DVD cases so that the shelf will be high enough to hold at least one row of DVD's, but then I had to line the entire back of blank DVD's... luckily I got the empty cases free from a closing Block Buster... So I have a row of blank DVD cases behind the row of my TV DVD shows I have. Very disappointed, spending this much money for something that ended up being way to large and deep, and so not what the description says. I would ask for a refund and return it, but that would cost me money to return it, and the box it came in ended up getting ripped up too much to use to ship it back, and I'm using it, even though I only get one row out of it. Anyhow..."
3,Foremost Modular cube,"Received the item quickly. It is perfect for the purpose intended. I set my TV on top of the cube and a modem, router & cable box on one shelf and a DVD player on the other which gave me more space on my desk in my study."
2,Parents be aware the problems with this toy,"My boys was excited as I showed this toy for them. After I put battery in and played few round, it just won't go anymore. I thought it was battery problem so I bought brand new battery and put it in. It is still won't work. I was really disappointed. I should have checked reviews before I bought this Item."
5,My kids love it!,"I purchased two of these jet engines. After purchasing the regular battery powered die cast engines I thought I would give these a try. I am so happy with them!! These are faster and so much more durable then the other engines. These have a mechanism that stops when kids push or pull it, where the others broke. Therefore this can also be a push engine. This takes two batteries apposed to one but, to my surprise they have been running strong for over 2 weeks now, the others barely lasted 2 days. I am so happy with this purchase, and am so glad that I bought one for both of my little ones!"
4,I got this as a reward for a child who finally got to his goal,"I got this plus the early reader book ""Thomas and the Jet Engine"" for a kindergartener who still loves Thomas. He met a big goal, and this was his reward. He loved it. Because the battery goes in the trailer jet, the power is pushing instead of pulling. The train doesn't manage turns well, but it does climb hills, and it's just so cute. Makes a clicking sort of noise, light at the back of the jet. Takes two AA batteries."
2,Cute and he loved it.... BUT...,"My son received this train for Christmas and was ECSTATIC. We put in a battery and he was off! Like other people have said, this train DOES NOT stay on the tracks, but I expected that when I added it to his wishlist because I am a review-reader. I figured it would stay on a little better than it did-- every time it hits a curve it flies off-- so if you have a lot of straight lines in your track, this could still be lots of fun for you.Unfortunately, the train WE received died almost immediately. We changed the batteries, tried everything. It was, after 1 day of play, just... dead.It is on its way back now as a return. We have opted to get a different item instead of a replacement because I feel $30 is a lot to spend to have it die immediately and because the falling off the tracks made it hard to play with for my 2 year old.Again, it is a fun item if you have lots of straights in your track, but I have to lop off some stars for it full-out dying on us."
4,SOLID,"This thing is solid.The Jet engine is s mix of plastic and die cast metal, which as a nice surprise.The jet engine looks very sleek and is quite powerful.We used it to push a train of like 6 cars of mixed brands up a hill of Ikea track and it worked pretty well. Sometimes it derailed, some times not. But it's a pretty powerful little engine and worth the money, especially since it's comes with a Thomas engine, is is very well detailed.We were looking for a powered engine and this was a very fun, unique and reasonably price choice.The only complaint I have it that there is no magnet in the rear of the engine, so you can only push trains, not pull them. Which is a shame. A lot of the derailment come because it's pushing the train. If it were to pull trains, I'm pretty derailments would be a lot less.We're going to cannibalize a magnet from one of our older, cheaper train cars and see if we can attach it to the engine and see how well it pulls."
3,strong motor,"I've been looking for a battery operated train for the thomas track that can make it around the track well. This train is capable of pushing trains up hills but because the magnet attachment has a connector piece, the trains seem to derail too often. I think if the magnet was attached directly to the the train it would work better. I would recommend this train but beware that your layout may need to be simple in order for it to work properly."
4,not again,Please remove me from your e-mail list I don't intend to fill out another one of these. three more words
3,Nice idea but not practical,"The jet engine is is very powerful, which is great. EXCEPT it over powers the train in front of it and derails almost every time it gets to a curve. The Thomas engines that are battery powered are wonderful, but this one falls short."
5,This jet engine really is fast!,"My 4yo son received this as a gift. He loves it, and so does his 2yo sister. They have played with it for hours already. the expression on Thomas' face is priceless, but the children just like the jet engine. It needs 2 AA batteries-not one as stated."
2,Doesn't stay on the track,I bought this for more 2 year old who just loves Thomas. He loves to turn the engine on and let it go on the floor. But as soon as you put it on the track it derails as soon as it hits a curve. He still has a great deal of fun with it but I think they need to tweek it a bit so it won't go off the track so easily.
2,Jet engine is too powerful,"My 4 yr old loves Thomas and has a ton of the various types of Thomas train sets. My husband bought the Thomas and the Jet Engine for him as a special treat. Unfortunately, the jet engine pushes too hard, so if you have any curves in your track, it pushes right off the track. This is very frustrating. Yes I realize Thomas is pushed very fast by the jet engine in the movie, but the toy shouldn't push him right off the track if there is more than a slight gradual curve. This was a total waste of money. Every once in a while my son will try it again and then puts the jet engine aside again because it won't stay on the track."
2,Only lasted one month,"My son loved this toy. He played with it almost every day. We did have similar problems with it going off of the track on tight curves but most of the time it worked very well and pushed 6+ cars. However, it only lasted one month. It was time to change the batteries since it was slowing down and when we changed them it never started again. It just would click when we pushed the start button. Hopefully the company will honor their 90 day guarantee and replace or repair it."
2,Not a good choice,"My two sons age 3 1/2 and almost 2 love their new Thomas railway system, but this battery powered engine is problematic for even the 3 1/2 year old to operate. It goes so fast that it pushes the engines off the track. (We have tried about 10 different engines with it.) It is also too tall to go under one of our bridges. It does not pull cars so we can't add cars behind it to try to slow it down either. Both boys have had much better luck (and more fun) with the battery-powered James engine."
2,Try Another Battery Powered Train,"This is one of the most frustrating toys that my son has. It's just too powerful for most any layout and constantly falls off of the track. We love Battery Powered Percy, but this one is propelled by the rear jet engine which causes it to be unstable. Plus, the first model we bought was broken within the first 24 hours."
1,Goes off track around curves. Does not pull other cars.,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son who loves trains. We have a Brio engine, but it is not strong enough to pull many cars (my son likes to put about 5 or more cares behind the engine). I figured with this Jet Engine taking 2 AA batteries, it would be up to the task.Well, we found several problems:1. It is so fast that it often goes off the track around curves (especially the shorter curve track pieces). We have one Y shaped track piece and the jet engine just goes right down the center and off the end.2. The jet engine only pushes, it doesn't pull. There's only a magnet at the front. We tried putting a bunch of cars in front of it, but when the first few cars go around a curve and the jet engine is still on the straight track, it derails.3. It's loud. I would put up with that if it didn't go off the track so often."
1,Frustrating for my child,"My son recently turned 3, and while he often tries to play with this toy, it frustrates him because he can't get it to stay on the track. Neither can I. Falling off bad enough, but if you have any sort of attachments, like tunnels or special bridges or what have you, it can get stuck on them.Just let your child enjoy watching the rocket on the screen. Stay away from this toy. There are other motor-powered engines that do a better job of staying on the track, even if none of them do it particularly well. And I am using official Wooden Railway tracks."
2,Poor quality,"I purchased this even with all the poor reviews because it was the only toy my son wanted for Christmas. It doesn't stay on the tracks well, however this doesn't bother my son as he thinks that is part of the fun. However, the coupling broke after two weeks. Thomas toys are too expensive to break after a short period of time. Currently have request for exchange it to Learning Curve. Only time will tell if they will honor it."
3,thomas and the jet-engine wood set,"The battery-powered engine is metal and very heavy; slowing it down a lot. My son was hoping for a fast-moving train. That won't happen with this one. He likes the lights and both sets of wheels move it along the track fine. The weight of the jet-engine tends to topple it off the tracks on sharp curves. Overall, he likes it, but doesn't play with it as much as his other cars & engines."
3,Poor design,This was my (or should I say my daughter's) first ever Thomas product. Yes it is too fast and derails all the time because of the way it pushes Thomas and the way the two are connected with along articulated coupling. I opened mine up and replaced one of the two AA batteries with a metal paperclip. That slowed it down by and helped with derailing quite a bit but really it till tends to railroad Thomas right off any tight corners. Oh and if you are really clever you can put the batteries in backwards (if you try you will see why this is actually hard) and then the jet drags Thomas round backwards and that cures the derailing totally. A bit drastic perhaps!
4,Awesome voice,Fleming has an incredible voice. I heard Ugly Girl on the radio and immediatly set out to find their album. I wasn't disappointed. The music is terrific.
2,f&j totally sold out,this album doesn't even come close to 'delusions'. they totally sold out -- every song is disgustingly poppy. what a let down.
5,Fleming&John a semdiscovered talent deserving wide attention,"Having known Fleming & John for a number of years, their sense of pop songwriting and magnificent talent shines throughout this disc. Not only is this a great piece of work but is up to par with the biggest superstars of the day! I first met John and Fleming through a mutual friend in '92, and their rise to stardom has not changed thier woderful sense of humility and talent. Go buy the CD and you will realize you are listening to the next ""big thing."""
4,Intelligence and Talent,"Fleming and John, while a relatively unknown band, are extremely satirical and witty, as well as have musical talent. The song ""Ugly Girl"" hooked me the first time I heard it. It's about seeing your ex boyfriend again, but with a really ugly girl. It's funny, and yet wistful, and I think most of us know how it feels to be dumped only to be replaced by someone we find inferior.""The Way We Are"" is also a very good song...it's a little heavier in lyrics, but a little lighter musically. ""Don't let it fade away"" and ""I fall for you"" are also two of my personal favorites from the CD.I guess what I like most about this CD is the range of music that is on it. I also like Fleming's vocals...her voice has an edge and definite wit in her expression of the lyrics. I'll be looking forward to the next release."
3,"At first, it'll sound terrible..., esp ""The Way We Are""","But as you listen to the CD over and over (it was torture at first because I was desperately trying to decide whether I want to keep it or return it within the 2 weeks of purchase return policy), I started to really enjoy some of the songs. ""Ugly Girl"" was the reason I bought the album, but there are other songs on the CD that are really energetic like ""Devil's Food"" that I really enjoy. However, some songs are rather annoyingly noisy. Another good one on the album is ""Comfortable"": nice melody and not so noisy. BUT what kind of song is ""The Way We Are""?????? Its chorus is disharmonious and her voice can hurt your ears. Overall, half of the songs on the CD are good, the rest are either forgettable or skip-able."
5,Great Charts,"I am a martial arts instructor, and I have refer to the charts in this book at least 1-3 times a month for the last three or four years. It's my go-to book for meridian charts as well as for muscle and skeleton charts. In fact, I have even made photocopies of a couple of the pages to keep inside other books on dim mak because Tedeschi's charts are better than those in my other books.Susan Lynn Petersonauthor of Western Herbs for Martial Artists and Contact Athletes"
2,Not so essential,"A very misleading title and description for this book. Other than some very basic western concespts of anatomy (you got them in the 8th grade), this book is good for little more than it's thorough coverage of the meridians, which comprises more than 80% of it's content."
1,This book presents nothing new,"This book is simlpy a re write of any book found on the market conserning Chinese medicine. With no new information and no particular depth of understanding.Martial applications of acupuncture points taken directly out of The Encyclopedia of dim mak, with actual self defence applications made up by somebody who has obviouly never given any thought to practical self defence. A point in referenc, one application were you attack a standing man by kicking him in the arm pit! Give me a break.There is a wealth of good books being written by people who are researching and breaking new ground in our understanding of the body mechanism. Both as healers and as Martial Artist's This book is simply cashing in on others work and doesn't even do it well."
2,"Should be titled ""Essential Anatomy: For Teenagers""","In the above sense the book has some value (this why more than one star), but the elders should look for something more serious and comprehensive."
3,Great Charts - Poor Text,"Marc Tedeschi has put a great deal of work into this book as far as assembling all the necessary information for a basis to learn pressure point fighting into one text. His charts are excellent and include all the special points off the meridian lines. It is also nice to have the contrasting Feng Shui charts to display color, emotion, and additional data that does come into play during advanced study. However, his written theory explaining martial application is poor, and the photographs of applications are misleading.After cross referencing the data provided in the charts, they are completely accurate. I do think that this book is an excellent addition to a studying martial artist's library, but do not expect this book to teach you anything in regards to technique. Buy George Dillman for that. It is a supplemental data source...no more. Technique and teaching should be left to real teachers. I think Tedeschi would agree."
5,excellent overview,Mr Tedeschi put together an excellent overview of anatomy designed for the martial artist. Covering both eastern and western philosophies the book is filled with clear concise charts and diagrams. This should be required reference material for all those studying the martial arts.
3,Not enough martial arts content,"I think that the title is a bit misleading. This book does have lots of good information compiled into one source. The problem is that it is more of an anatomy book than a martial arts resource. There are good illustrations though I do not think that there is enough depth or analysis in the surrounding text. Discussions of meridians and pressure points are more suited to acupressure/acupuncture students than to martial artists who are the target of perhaps 10% of the content. There is almost nothing, for example, about how martial techniques work from a bio-mechanical perspective, nor how applications affect the body medically. If you want a good overview that compares and contrasts Western and Eastern thought it's a decent reference, but if you want an in-depth study suitable for serious martial artists this is probably not your best resource.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"
2,My two cents,The books of Mr. Tedeschi (I'm familiar with 4 titles) are of the highest quality. If you're interested in acupoint charts this title may be something you'll find interesting (nice charts and tables). IF your looking for martial arts information (specifically pressure points) then you may be better served by one of his other books - at least you'll get some martial arts information you might find interesting for the price and essentially the same pressure point information. The book contains 10 pages of information specify directed at the martial arts and its basically the same information in his other titles. I'm rating this solely from martial arts viewpoint.
3,The princess cap is cute but floppy,My daughter loved the way it looked in the picture but the cap was a little limp once it arrived. I think it should have a support in it to keep it on point. We kept it for dress-up but didn't use it for trick or treat... we got a crown instead.
4,Princess Hat,I looked EVERYWHERE for this type of hat. This one on Amazon is perfect. My 4 year old granddaughter loves it! It is a bit floppy after much use but I feel I got my monies worth.
3,Took a Chance,"Was very pleased with the book and the quick delivery. However, the book did not contain the item I was searching for, but did show some simularities. Will continue to shop."
2,Synthetic Fibers Don't Hold Much,"The synthetic fibers here don't seem to hold much cleaner/oil, and I don't care for the feel of the patches at all. I'll use these for a while, but won't buy more."
4,Decent patches for the money,"They work ok, but sometimes leave some threads behind in cleaning sometimes. Shouldn't cause any problems with gun operation, but something to be aware of when cleaning."
1,not recommended,These patches are too thin and don't absorb very much. They are not made of woven cloth but rather some sort of pressed fiber material which is more like paper than cloth.
3,Hope's 9 patches,"Good patches. They are however on the thin side. Actually they work out well for cleaning a 380 automatic if you like wrapping a patch around the brush. Otherwise there are better patches out there. If you don't want to waste your time figuring what you should buy, just go right to Sinclair's web site and order patches from them. The most knowledgeable of my shooting friends use Sinclairs patches. I bought them and not I know why! I always thought that if I got anything from Hope's, it would be the best. Think again!"
3,ok... but not what i expected,"These weren't the soft flannel patches I'm used to. Less cotton fluff and more nylon or polyester... But after using them, I'm not unhappy with my purchase, they work ok. The patches aren't very absorbent, but they do take the grime of fairly well. I found myself doubling them up a lot, which kind of defeats the savings I got buying these over something else. Great lesson, and not an expensive one!"
3,Use two at a time,"Back in the 1980's and earlier Hoppe's patches were cotton flannel, then they went to this cheap synthetic material. You have to use two patches at a time because they are thin and do not absorb very well. The only good thing about these is the price buying in bulk.Hoppes Gun Cleaning Patches, 38 to 45 CaliberYou could pay $2.60 + $5.54 shipping for 40 of these patches, here you get 500 for $7.37. They are OK, but the cotton flanel ones like theAllen Company Gun Cleaning Patches (225 Pieces)for 30Cal, 357 Handgun to 45Calare much better.They are good for use as applicators when you do not want to waste a quality patch."
3,You get what you pay for,"The patches are nothing special. They're made to be a cheap way to clean your gun, and that's exactly what they are. No real pros or cons."
2,These patches are too flimsy,"I found, much to my disappointment, that these patches are not the traditional flannel patches. They appear to be polyester or some similar fibre. In use, I found them to be flimsy, requiring that two patches be used together to get a tight enough fit to the bore. They are also not very absorbent or durable."
2,Be warned,Not made of cotton. Very thin and roof. Def looking into another cleaning patch for handgun. I wish I would have read more reviews. Lesson learned
3,"Dry and dated book; good for the time, though","As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service, I believe that this book, though valuable for the time it was written, is dated and dry by today's standards. Obviously, a lot has transpired since this was written over four decades ago. Still, some worthwhile information for the Secret Service enthusiast out there."
2,Unexpected ...,"Arrived with one leg broken and one deep scar in front leg. The installation menu looks like a treasure hunting map, the printing quality and its design were so poor that I could not see what the figures were trying to tell me. I have to make lots of guesses to make sure the whole thing will install correctly. The color is nearly BLACK, totally different from the one advertised on Amazon.com. The back support is nearly straight and the sit is to short (with a medium body size, I have to sit on the bench like stupid with 1/3 of my upper leg hanging out of the sit. I have installed quite a few complex furniture and this one took my 3 hours and 20 minutes. The amount of glue came with the shipment is absolutely insufficient. I need to use extra wood glue to make a good assembly. NOT recommended."
2,Buyer Beware - Dimensions not as advertised!!!,"I purchased this bench to fit in a specific space in my house. Unfortunately, the dimensions on this bench are not as advertised, and the bench is too large for the space that I have. Assembly took about 2 hours, and I did not realize that the dimensions were not as advertised until the bench was fully assembled. I am disappointed, and frustrated."
4,Nice hat,"In my quest to find a denim cowboy hat, I came across this little beauty. While not quite perfect, this is a nice hat. The brim is shapeable, which has its ups and downs, but the hat is comfortable and looks sharp enough for everyday wear. I added a hat band to mine just to spice it up a bit, but even without, it looks great."
1,Orality and Illiteracy,"Read this book only if you are forced to do so by someone. Even that didn't do it for me. One of my main hang ups was that in early going Ong describes something as ""thing-like"". Is it possible for something to not be ""thing-like""? I mean if it wasn't someTHING, then it wouldn't be anything and you couldn't talk about it. Then the rest of the thing is just boring. If you want an expensive fire starter or something to stop the teetering of some annoying table then buy this."
4,"fascinating, but a slow read.","""Orality and Literacy"" is a scholarly work, which is the author's intent. Because of this, it requires a college level reading ability. With those warnings in mind, it is also a fascinating book on a somewhat remote subject: the way that our ability to write has changed our ways of thinking about ourselves and the world, our ways of remembering, and the progress of human development. It is a good introduction to this academic area as the author surveys the existing research and catalogs his sources very thoroughly. He gives particular attention to how oral cultures deal with thinking, remembering, and relating to the community in fundamentally different ways than literate cultures do. As a teacher, I found myself wondering if we could learn from oral cultures some of the old ways of relating to and remembering what we hear. Our literacy has allowed us to abandon these narrative and remembering techniques- to our impoverishment, I suspect."
3,"One Interesting Concept, 179 Grueling Pages","According to Ong, who wrote this book in 1981 (pre-WWW), writing is a form of technology that, through the act itself, changes the brain. By change, I mean that it compels one to think of the world in a whole different way. He doesn't so much as say that oral culture is inferior to literal culture, as he does take care to point out how humans are natural to both. It's actually interesting stuff.I had to read this book for class. Otherwise, it's not light read, so unless you're just a tech-freak, leave the book on the shelf."
5,Great Transaction!,Great product that arrived exactly on time! It was just what I needed and just as described in the product details. Thanks!
4,Great cable.,It is a nice thick cable. Fits nice and snuggly without having to force it. Belkin brandname gives you peace of mind.
4,Great Product for money,This is a great product if you are looking to hook up your system and dont want to spend the money at a place like Best Buy. I didnt think I could get all the hookups for my HDTV because at Best Buy every cord is atleast $40. This one works just as well.
4,Works perfectly,"Used this to hook up my older carousel type CD player to my A/V receiver/amp. Works like a charm and can't imagine a need for a more expensive version of the same thing. High quality, and well made."
5,A must have!,"Now in its second printing, this book is essential reading for anyone interested in doing genre analysis, especially in the fields of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and Second Language (L2) writing. Almost any article on the subject that has appeared in print within the past 20 years cites Swales at least once, and more likely multiple times. His IMRD (Introduction-Methods-Research-Discussion) structure, moves analysis model, and mixed-methods approach have all been tremendously influential. At the same time, Swales emphasizes commonalities with other fields like Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and New Rhetoric that may allow for more cross-disciplinary collaboration and, ideally, greater insights into the ways in which genres both shape and are given shape by the writing we do."
3,"Great tracks, sucks for the copy protection","If you liked the original version of Beautiful World, I think you will enjoy the remixes that come on this disc. I would give this cd 5 stars but I can't. I can't give it 5 stars because I can't use this disc on all my devices like I can with most of my other CDs because of the stupid copy protection crap they put on this disc.I can get it on my iPod, but the tracks won't play. I can upload it to my xbox 360, but those tracks won't play there either. The disc works in all my standard cd players.I have a lot of CDs, having to swap discs all the time or not being able to listen on a portable totally ruins the experience. I'll never buy another Purple City music record again. ever.When will these companies learn?"
4,good book!,"this book was a real easy read. it took me half a day, but i really enjoyed it. it seemed real, the author did a great job describing everything in a short period of time. poor sarah and jen. lol."
5,Works Great,"Although I was looking for a unit that was bootable - something that Toshiba made next to impossible for my M200 tablet - this unit was not. Not a fault of the seller though.As an external DVD/CD Drive, it functioned quite well.David"
2,debe haber mejores libros para aprender francés,El libro no es mas que un cuento en francés con ortografía fonética. Creo que hay mejores maneras de aprender.
3,These run wide and long,"My son is 2 1/2 yrs old and is tall for his age. these are a little loose at the waist (he's thin), the material is thinnish, but okay. My only gripe is they are super wide cut. The cuff's at the bottom are as wide as adult pants. Now that I look at the pic it makes sense, but I couldn't imagine how wide they really would be."
5,"mammoth cave national park, kentucky","watching this video brought extremely new and beautiful sights for me to see, and most especially ones that i have never seen like in my entire life. I truly recomend this video for fun, ammusement, and also to gain more knowledge about the beautiful natural enviornment that surrounds us. Many of the people throughout the world can not go a visit these places, as much as we would love to go, so by watching this video, you can visit the most beautiful sight on earth with you loved ones, or whomever may want to watch it. I had a great time watching it the first time, and as i played it over and over again, the excitement was still there, and maybe even more thrilling every time you watch it, because you catch onto something new every time. So i conclusion, i would deffinately recomend this to everyone throughout the world, and of all ages. It will truly take you on an adventure that you will never forget..."
1,from a college math instructor,"This book is improperly organized - concepts in mathematics must be understood from the easiest level to the most difficult - this book presents the material for memorization, NOT understanding. This is the first time that I encounter math organized in such a way. While everything is explained well enough, the lumping together of too much information for difficult concepts makes it difficult to learn properly. Try McKeague instead, same title, just a much better book."
1,False Advertisement,"This book was advertised as being a ""Hardcover"" copy. When I recieved my shipment in the mail (a day late even after I payed to expedite it), it came as a piece of paper with a username and password to access an ""e-book"". I was very dissatisfied with this seller because I was mislead into what i was buying. I would not sugguest buying anything from this person and if you choose to, make sure you read and know exactly what your getting. Possibly even email before you purchase to make sure."
1,text book,I never received this book because it got lost in the process. I then had to order it through the school book store and pay full price.
3,"damaged book, company good","When the book arrived, the shipping box was very damaged on one end. The book was not pack properly and also was quite damaged. I returned it and received a refund without a problem. I most likely would order from them again."
1,Packed with missing and wrong parts,"Maybe this bookcase is good. I don't know because I can't put it together! It arrived packaged with numerous missing parts and duplicates of other parts. For example there was only suppose to one #8 part but we had two of those and extra #7's as well but no #2 or #3 parts. We then placed a call to the company with a list of the missing parts and they agreed to FedEx them to us. That seemed fine and we were happy...until the FedEx arrived, STILL with wrong parts. It is now three weeks later and I still have no #1 shelf part to put this thing together. I am very frustrated with this company and ready to throw this thing away before we've even used it. Very disorganized company. Who packs these boxes with the parts - monkeys?"
1,Warning: Off-gassing,"Other reviews for this product complain about the durability of this bookshelf, but I actually think it has worked really well for us. We have filled all three shelves completely with my daughter's books and it seems stable and strong. However, we have serious problems with it's chemical smell. We have left it in our garage for several weeks, and then brought it back in to our daughter's room, only to find the smell still there. We have looked online for suggestions to get rid of the smell and we tried vinegar and putting a cut onion next to it (supposedly they absorb chemical smells), but to no avail. It still smells. It is back in the garage and I am so disappointed in this product. The style, size, and build of it is perfect for our needs, but I don't want my daughter or any of us in our home breathing in what might be toxic smells from this bookcase. Buyer beware!"
4,Great product for the price,"Great bookshelf for the price. Sturdy, easy to put together. Only four stars because there are no plugs to fill out the holes on the side, but other than that, a really good piece of furniture for my two year old's room."
5,Very pleased in Tn,Very pleased with product husband put it together within 1 hour 30 minutes no problem. Good quality wood will definitely purchase other kids craft products two thumbs up
1,Not Worth It,"Hello,I just received mine and am fairly disappointed. I was expecting ""wood"" but received MDF. The KidKraft web site states wood, but the product is clearly MDF. I called customer support to confirm and the woman I spoke to was somewhat annoyed of the question. For $120, you'd expect a solid wood piece. I purchased a much better, solid wood bookcase from Staples that is $79. The reason I wanted the KidKraft is because of the size and design (for my son's room). If you want any kind of wood, do not buy this product - it's fairly cheap.1 Star simply because of the design."
1,targetdecor is horrible,"i didn't actually ever receive this bookcase because i finally just cancelled my order today. i ordered it on april 6 and have been waiting for its arrival for eight weeks now. the thing is, every time i called the company, (after being on hold for 30 minutes) I was told that it was shipping soon. they always gave me a specific date or timeframe and reassured me that it would be coming at that time. last friday i was told that it had shipped and they would send me a tracking e-mail. since i never received that, i called today (another 30 min hold session), and the person told me that it was estimated to ship on june 23. i asked to cancel, but now let's see if i get any sort of refund. (they charged my credit card immediately after i placed the order of course)just want to warn others before using this company!"
1,Totally useless,"This is the most finicky 802.11b card I've seen; a few minutes after connecting, it disconnects for no apparent reason. The client software is awful. Changing any setting causes the security keys to be forgotten (I typed my security key in so many times, I memorized all 32 hex digits of it). Sometimes, it insists on trying an ad-hoc connection with other PCs around it, even if it set to ""Infrastructure"" only."
5,Works Instantly! Wireless couldn't be easier.,"Took it out of the box, plugged it in, popped in the CD, and voila! Instant wireless connectivity. Couldn't be easier. The one I got included sniffer software which is PRICELESS. It automatically detects whenever I'm in range of a working WiFi signal, and tells me whether that signal is open and available or requires a password.ALSO SMC's 24-hour toll-free tech support is surprising and worth noting (I haven't had any problems but was interested in getting more of these cards for my family which uses Macs. No dice. Only works with Windows. But the tech guys surprised me by answering quickly and being quite knowledgeable and helpful). Would definitely buy again!"
2,Poor design,"I agree whole heartedly with the reviewer who pointed out the design flaw in the rear wheels. When the toy is in the walker mode, the area between the 2 rear wheels is way too small and there are sharp parts (meant for the wagon mode) that can hurt baby's feet. Also, when in the walker mode, the shape sorter is not easily accessible. In my opinion, this toy is not worth the money. If you already have it and you think the toy moves way too fast for a child just beginning to walk, try using it on a carpeted surface- it slows it down a little. Your money would be better spent on another walker with a better design"
2,Unstable,This wagon was given to my daughter by her grandparents. It is so lightweight that we had to place two 8 pound weights on the bottom to keep it from flying ahead of her. If she jerked it at all or tried to pull up on it... the toy just fell over... which resulted in a lot of accidents. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,"Okay walker, but as a pull toy, it's not so good","My twins like the doodads on this walker, the flip pages, the twisty knob and the spring thingy. As a walker it does move a little fast. My daughter had no problems with this, but my son did. I guess every baby is different, but he would end up falling a lot because it got away from him. Now, as we have just converted it to the ""wagon"" feature, it seemed like it was going to be great, but the handle FALLS to the floor!! I don't know why they couldn't make it so the handle would stay up. It is very frustrating for my kids. For some reason they have trouble bending down to pick the handle up and then pulling it. Also, because the handle lays on the floor, it takes up a lot of room!! Anyway, it's okay. I think I would get something different if I had to do it over again."
2,Not good for babies just learning to walk,"I bought this walker for my baby when she was 10 months old and pulling herself up/doing the 'furniture scoot' to help her learn to balance and walk. While she loves playing with the toys, the walker is unstable and pulls right down on top of her when she tries to use it to pull herself up. The wheels move really fast and when she tries to walk with it (now 11.5 months old) it flies forward and she falls. We have to hold it carefully. Also, the red pieces on the inside of the rear wheels (where the white handle connect) are in the way of her feet, and have sharp plastic on the seam. This was a good idea and has fun toys on it, but the functionality of the walker wasn't well thought-out by the manufacturer. I'm buying Chicco now becuase I've heard better things about it."
4,Great for Assisted Walking NOT for Beginners,"My 13-month old used it once he learned how to stand up on his own and walk between furniture. He would use this to race around the living room, as it moves VERY fast and cannot be adjusted. He used it on carpet and it seems it would be a lot slippery on any other flooring.He still likes to use the walker feature vs the wagon feature, he'd rather push on it than have to drag it. He is 16 months and will sit for 1-3 minutes playing on the attached toys."
4,Fun For All,Both my 3 year old and my 9 month old love this. The only problem is that they fight over it!
1,A (...),"As a Western academic who has carried out extensive research in post-Saddam Iraq, I was looking forward to reading this book, especially with regards to human trafficking in new Iraq. I was disappointed and found this book to be a mere collection of anecdotes that did not bring anything new to the many burning issues in New Iraq. Trafficking of women and girls does indeed exist in post-Saddam Iraq, this under the nose of the very people who have a responsibility to protect the populations under their care: the US. This book is a waste of time and money."
1,Looter's memoir,"There are reports that Mr. Braude pleaded guilty to looting the Iraqi artifacts. Amazon.com would better investigate this and stop distributing his volume.timesdaily.com, 08/03/04: An expert on Iraq's postwar reconstruction has pleaded guilty to smuggling 4,000-year-old artifacts looted from the country's national museum after the U.S. invasion.Joseph Braude, 29, pleaded guilty Tuesday, two days into his trial on charges of smuggling and making false statements to customs agents. He could be sentenced to up to 16 months in prison.Braude studied Near Eastern languages at Yale University and Arabic and Islamic history at Princeton University before publishing ""The New Iraq: Rebuilding the Country for Its People, the Middle East and the World"" last year."
2,Not Really That Good,"I have purchased both of these CD Packages and must say I was very disapointed many of the songs are so muffled like the monkees theme and the coke commercials,these could certainly have been cleaned up and sound modified but this company did nothing to do this.I would not if I was you buy either of these two for cd,s and stick to the main one from Boyce and Hart it sounds much better.You know if these were cheap releases I could see this beng the case for muffled sound but these were very expensive."
2,Not 6 seconds!,This thermometer takes a lot longer than 6 seconds! It seems to go forever. I wouldn't suggest buying this if you are looking for a quick thermometer.
5,McBride's Stellar Review,"Good book, great author, excellent service and delivery by vendor. What more could I ask?"
3,Mandolin Beginners Beware!,"While this is a decent book for a beginner, there is one major flaw, that being the fact that you have to be able to read music! Unfortunately I dont. Most beginners books are based on tablature, a method that is very easy to master and it allows you to play without knowing how to read music. I did learn a few things from this book and if you're interested in learning how to read music while you learn the basics of the mandolin, then you'll probably enjoy this publication."
5,good and healthy snack,I was looking for a healthy snack for work. I like to munch on stuff while I am working. I didn't want to go with chocolate or chips or any of the junk food. I tried this bars because it has organic fruit in it. I like it after the first try. Now I have something healthy to munch on and it taste great.
4,chocolate brownie is the best flavor,pure bar chocolate brownie is a great gluten free bar. it does taste like a brownie and the ingredients are fresh and simple. i tried all their flavors and keep going back to this one.
2,didn't like the taste,"I was drawn to the natural-ness of this bar but I just don't like the taste and texture. It's gluey-mushy, whereas I prefer bars that have bits of rice or crunch in them. Unfortunately I'm trying to make it through this entire box that I bought."
4,Most of these bars are really good!,"We bought the variety pack so I got to try each flavor. My favorite by far was the orange cranberry, but I also liked the apple cinnamon, chocolate brownie, and trail mix. I wasn't crazy for the cherry or blueberry but they're not really my favorite fruits to begin with. Each of the bars have a similar texture, it is really only the flavor that changes. Some people say that the texture takes some getting used to but I didn't find it strange at all, actually a nice change from granola bars. The one thing I would warn about is that each bar is pretty high in calories, so if you're really calorie conscious you might want to skip these and buy something that comes in a smaller portion. The variety pack is a great way to try them all and figure out which ones your family really likes."
2,hmm split on this one,"Wife loves it i think they taste like DIRT, lol. I really dont like these but i could be wront, the larabars taste and have a better texture. this one is dirt to me.... :P"
2,Too sweet,"Pure datesIt seems like it has 90% of dates. I should have read the ingredients before ordering. Every bar tastes like dates, no matter what flavor it is.Get it if like DATES.Before I ordered the box I loved them, now I can't stand it. Really too much.It is so sweet that I cut into little squares and eat it as candy."
2,Didn't like the taste,"Was much worse than the Lara bars. Had less nut contents, not satisfyingAt all. Did not deliver what I expected"
3,Not bad...,This is great for a snack. Good flavor and texture. The only drawbacks for me are not enough protein to make it last and not enough fiber. It's simply a snack. Would probably work well for children for school lunches.
2,Just Good,"This bar is not the best but it is not bad at all. The flavor seems just like other Kellog's bars, I can't really taste the ""organic"" difference. I have tried other organic bars sold at Whole Foods and I could really tell the difference in flavor.What I don't like about these bars is the PRICE ! They are very expensive compared with other similar products. I cannot justify to pay this much for a bar which flavor is almost similar to store brands."
2,not crazy about it,Maybe if I was stuck on a desert island and only had these to eat...then I would eat it again. I did not like the taste or the consistency.
3,"Gummy, but good","Nice citric snappy flavor. Filled me up even though there wasn't much more than two bites. A great snack for after chemo, to supplement meals, or just give you a boost in the middle of the day. The only complaint I related to gumminess. Serious gumminess going on where there should be *some* crunch. Granola bars have that slight, bumpy texture and just a bit of crunchiness. This has neither. BUT the blueberry goodness does make up for most of what the texture lacks."
2,Mona Lisa,The taste of this bar is OK but not that great. I guess it is just a matter of preference. I have tasted other organic fruit and nut bars and they had a lot more flavor. The ingredients are good for you but with not nuch flavor.
3,Good Tasting and Goof for You,"It has a real nice fruitiness to it. The flavor is sweet-tart but not overly tart like a kids candy. For me, the nuts is what really wins me over. A 1.7 oz. bar provides 190 calories (8g fat, 25g carbs, 7g protein). Not bad. Compare to Odwalla bars that come in at 2 oz. and 200+ calories. Personally, I would like the bar to be a little bigger but, I often eat these bars either as a meal or while I am walking a round of golf so I want as many calories as I can get. The package is almost twice as long as the bar (marketing trick).Considering this bar is free of preservatives, trans fats, cholesterol, refined sugar, gluten, soy, and dairy it is pretty good. If you have an allergy to any of those things this is a good snack food choice."
2,Ok but nothing special.,"Pure hypes this as ""Organic, Vegan, 4 grams of fiber..."" and so on for a long paragraph. I don't really care. It looks like a candy bar or a snack bar and that's how I'll review it.When compared to their Cherry Cashew bar, this has a cleaner, fresher taste. The blueberry flavor is strong and, since I like blueberry, that's a good thing. There is little aftertaste.Texture isn't good. Too sticky.It's nice to have the Omega 3s, vitamins and what not but I take supplements for those anyway.Summing up, it's not a bad snack but it's nothing I'd look forward to. And at the current price it's not something I'd recommend unless you're heavily into the ""organic"" stuff."
3,Organic fruit & nut bar: Just OK,"Well, the good thing about bar is that is actually tastes better than it looks. It does NOT look very appealing. It is also filling, so if you're looking for a quick fix between meals, this is a pretty good choice. For me, it was just ok, I think there's better snack bars out there that, unless you have to have gluten-free food, would be tastier."
2,Not for me,Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry raw fruit and nut bar is not for me. It was like eating an unbaked blob of dough mixed with bits of nuts and bland blue berries. I would rather eat a blueberry pop tart than this.
3,"Has potential, but this wasn't my favorite flavor.","I have recently become interested in ""raw foods"" as a means toward good health, so I've started trying a number of different ""bars"" out. These were better than several I've tried, but not the best.PROS:Good, fruity flavor.Better texture than several other brands.Not overly sweet.Cashew flavor was still noticeable.CONS:Still a little on the chalky side.Not quite sweet enough.Not as good as some other flavors from this brand.This particular bar isn't one that I would buy of my own volition. The flavor, overall, was still pretty bland. The blueberry was quite a bit better than the cherry. My husband and kids thought the blueberry was best. None of us loved this one."
3,Not raw enough,"My initial impression was that this bar tastes pretty much like dates, not cherries and cashews. The base texture is soft and dense. The chopped nuts add a nice amount of textural contrast. It's not very sweet, which I don't mind, but I felt like something was missing (salt?) - the flavor never moved past the middle of my tongue. I'd sum up the flavor by saying that it was inoffensive.While I understand the convenience of having an individually-wrapped bar in your bag, I would rather eat a handful of nuts and dried fruit - it certainly tastes better, is closer to a raw and unprocessed food, has less impact on the environment, and costs less."
5,Tasty!,I enjoyed eating the blueberry bar. It even smells pure! The texture is a bit gritty but the taste and overall health benefits have won me over! I feel so healthy eating this bar.
4,Pretty good,"As these bars are made without most of the bad stuff in others, they taste rather different. Not bad, just different. Noticeably less sweet, and without the artificial binders, they also feel different in terms of texture. It would take some getting used to, doing without all that sugary flavor, but the blueberry bar tasted just fine."
3,Pretty good - but not much blueberry taste,"I happen to like the taste of this, but it's not what I was expecting from a ""wild blueberry"" bar. IMO, it doesn't have much blueberry taste at all - something that I want to mention in case that's what you are wanting. However, the taste was enjoyable to me.I like that these use organic ingredients and are primary a fruit and nut bar. I'd choose to eat these if I was in a hurry and/or couldn't get a regular meal. It would make me feel better about my choice than if I were to eat a candy bar. However, these aren't something that I would choose to eat on a regular basis given the cost per bar. I'd rather pack some trail mix or the like. However, I would consider buying these if they were on sale."
3,"Good for You, But Not Really Good","I was somewhat disappointed in the PURE Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit and Nut Bar. Yes, it's a very ""health-wise"" product, and yes, it's nice that all these natural ingredients come in a convenient, portable form.But I found the bar's somewhat dry and mealy texture to be fairly unappetizing. Nor did I care much for the flavor, which was fairly bland but left a slightly bitter, sour aftertaste. This product is a poor substitute for a serving of fresh organic fruit and raw nuts, and I cannot in all good conscience recommend it to anyone who values taste over content."
2,Buy the Blueberry One--Cherry is the Worst,"I received both a blueberry and cherry Pure Bar. The blueberry is much better. Both are a little dry. Both are not as sweet as other raw bars--which is actually nice change. I can't recommend the cherry one at all... but the blueberry one would be nice on occasion. Can't see myself purchasing an entire box.I really think that if you're trying to eat healthfully... and want something that has real fruit and nuts in it... you're much much better off buying some dried or fresh cherries and nuts. If you love dates, buy some medjool ones. 1000x healthier...most likely cheaper... much tastier....and just as convenient. You don't need added agave and all the other nonsense."
3,"Nice enough bar, but I like Lara bars better.","I tried the wild blueberry organic pure bar. It was okay. The smell was overwhelmingly blueberry - almost synthetic smelling - but I checked and the product is all natural and all organic. Our household is a Lara Bar household so it was interesting to compare this to our normal fare. The PURE bar is very greasy, which I thought was kind of weird. The taste was okay. Not great. There were nice chunks of nuts, much bigger than you would find in a Lara bar. I definitely won't change brands, but it is nice to know that there are other options out there if you find yourself in a place that doesn't carry the Lara Bar. You do have to know that these types of bars have plenty of fat, nuts and thus calories in them, a bit under 2 ounces and a bit under 200 calories. They are much denser than your regular run-of-the-mill granola or fiber bar and they are definitely ""healthy"" tasting. All in all, just okay. I'm sticking with Lara Bars."
3,Just Ok,"This cherry cashew bar is heavy, feels like it weighs more than the 1.7 ounces it states on the package.The bar is a dark brown, which reminds of chocolate or fig. You can plainly see the cashews on the outside, as well as on the inside of the bar.It does have a tart taste, probably from the cherries. It also has an oily feel to the bar.It's ok, but I don't think I would buy this on a regular basis, if at all.I really didn't care for the taste."
3,Very interesting,"The color of the bar isn't appetizing; however, the taste is pleasant though a little too nutty for my preference. I have organic products in the past...and well...this definitely superior to those..this one actually tasted good....many of the others left a cardboard sensation with a nasty medicinal aftertaste. This one did not. No added sugar as far as I can tell. The kids didn't like it because it wasn't sweet enough...but isn't that the point of being organic...getting away from processed sugars and stuff."
3,"Pretty tasty, watch for nut shell fragments","I enjoyed this cherry cashew date bar.. until i almost broke a tooth on a nut shell fragment. Ouch. That happens with processed nuts, though.Wait, the package says ""Nothing processed."" as part of it's natural-organic hype. That's a little dishonest IMHO (it takes ""processing"" to remove nut shells and to get the nectar from agave plants).Likes:* Good texture, flavor.* Reasonable sugar content @ 17g.* Very low sodium.* 3g fiber, 7g protien.* Organic ingredients.Dislikes:* Hype on the packaging is a little excessive. ""No refined sugars"", ok, but agave nectar is processed, refined (well, reduced) and just as bad for you (see recent studies).* Nut shell fragment--ouch--hope that is rare.Overall this is a tasty snack, especially if you have a restrictive diet (gluten free and vegan)."
4,"Delicious, but little bit too sweet for my taste","I love nuts, and having lots of them jammed into a snack bar is a nice thing. This item is exactly that.Since it's a mix, do not expect to taste each nut separately, but it tastes well. My only complaint is that the dates (as in fruit) in it are a little bit dominant in the taste, making it slightly more sweet than I expected. Yet this is natural sugar, and can be balanced easily with a cup of water."
3,Lives Up to the Name,"This bar is all raw fruits and nuts with a little brown rice thrown in as a binder. The first ingredient on the label is organic dates and that is mostly what I tasted. There are bits of the tart cherry flavor but not enough to really notice. Visually, the bar is not terribly appealing. It looks like a rectangle of mashed dates with small white bits of macadamia nut. If you are into raw foods or on a vegan diet, it's a nice ready to go snack alternative. The taste wasn't bad but it's not something that I would choose if I had another option. (Of course, this is from someone who's used to eating regular granola bars with all the sugar and unpronounceable ingredients on the label.) For nutritional value and wholesomeness, I would give this 5 stars and the taste wasn't bad but it wasn't the kind of thing I'd reach for when I want a snack."
2,A mediocre fruit bar,"I've had a variety of fruit bars over the years and this is definitely one of the worst. It doesn't have a great deal in the way of good flavor and it's over burdened with cashews and walnuts (neither of which I like). The labeling makes great hey out of the fact that it's not got gluten, doesn't use GMO's, has no cholesterol, no trans-fats, and that the blueberries used therein are raw. Because, you know, mankind was doing fine before we actually started cooking our foods.Beyond the hype of the product, there's not really anything worthwhile here, and lord help you if you have a nut allergy. This thing just didn't taste good and I can't say as though I have any interest in ever eating any more. Put it this way: When I first opened the box I was a little disappointed to see only one bar therein instead of a pack of twelve. Now I'm just relieved."
4,"Tasty bar, bit of cherry","I'll admit I'm not generally a healthy eater and don't have too many organic fruit bars, so I'm not sure what to compare this with. However, I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like a soft granola bar - you can taste the grains, without the crunch. However, for me at least, the cherry flavor wasn't very strong. I love anything cherry (I drink cherry-flavored seltzer regularly), and thought this bar had more of a strawberry-cashew flavor. Still tasty nonetheless."
1,"I'm not a nut guy, so this wasn't for me","I don't like nuts in my brownies, so this wasn't going to be for me. I didn't really like it. It's a dense bar though - you get quite a bit. So I tried it on my family. My wife says she'd probably buy it, so I guess she liked it. She said it's very natural (I agree). My 6-year-old didn't care for it, and my 2-year-old thought it was chocolate so he was a little ticked when it turned out otherwise. So 1 out of 4 for our family approves."
3,"""Pure"", But A Bit Chalky Tasting.","I love organic products and love these bars for the merit of their ingredients, but I'm not a super huge fan of the taste. They're a bit chalky and sort of dry.It's not too bad, but I think I'd eat these for the nutritional value and ""pure"" ingredients more than I would for their flavor."
4,good stuff,"I really liked this wild blueberry bar and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is not as good as the cherry cashew bar. One cannot go wrong with raw/organic. I don't normally purchase this kind of thing, but I will certainly purchase these as snacks in the future. I also think they are a nice, healthy option for young kids."
3,"OKay, but not fantastic","These were okay and edible, but I wasn't overly thrilled. Also, I thought it had too much sugar for something that is supposed to be considered healthy, and not enough protein. At over $1.50 per bar I think there are other bars more worthwhile and healthy to pick up."
2,Too many nuts (tastes more like nuts than blueberries),"I have to preface this by saying I'm not a nut person. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this was going to have so many nuts in it. I just saw that it was blueberry and didn't realize it would taste more like nuts than blueberries. It's very similar to Clif Nectar bars in taste and consistency. I did like that it's all raw and has all organic ingredients. I also thought that the sweetness-level was perfect. Not too sweet and not too bland. If you like nut-heavy raw food bars, I think you'll really like this. If, like me, you prefer something less nutty, skip this one."
3,Not enough cherry flavor,"The Cherry Cashew Pure bar had a weaker cherry flavor than I expected. It is a nice healthful snack, but I didn't like this flavor nearly as much as the blueberry bar."
2,Not Worth Purchasing,"Although I love organic foods and I especially love blueberries, I have to admit I was quite disappointed with the Wild Blueberry bar from Pure. Not only did it had the texture and taste of a bad fruitcake, but it was less nutritious than a comparative bar like something from Luna or Cliff. It also containing a whopping 14% of your daily fat intake. The only real value of the bar is in terms of copper and dietary fiber, both of which you can get in many other things and with far less fat. Perhaps a Fiber One bar which has less calories than this and 45% of your fiber instead of 16%All in all, I love that Pure bars are mostly organic, but they have no flavour or any actual health benefits. It's kind of a sham meant to prey on people that just see the word ""organic"" and assume something is actually good for them. Stay away."
4,Gluten free goodie with a mellow flavor,"I am a blueberry fan. I put them in lots of baked goods, eat them fresh every summer. So I was excited to try this bar in blueberry; I've been eating the PURE Cherry bars for some time now. I was surprised by the taste of these bars, neither pleasantly nor unpleasantly, just surprised. They were not very sweet - and the cherry bars are. So this was both good and bad. The cherry bars sometimes are too sweet and I feel like I've eaten candy afterward, whereas the blueberry bars have a subtle sweetness with a mellow flavor. The cashews dominate the taste in these. So, for every day fare, (especially for gluten free people) theses are much more grounding and more food-like than candy like. However, it's not necessarily a taste that I would crave every day. But that's me. They are definitely worth adding to your collection of bars - it's always nice to have variety. Enjoy!"
3,Good for What It Is,"When I opened the wrapper I was a bit taken aback at how dark in color the bar was. (I was expecting something lighter in color just because I'm used to lighter colored oats you find in granola bars.)The bar is very solid and dense, which I liked, so it felt like I was getting a real snack, and not just some airy, cheap bar. The cherry flavor is pretty heavy making it a little sweet and it's well balanced out by the cashews in it. (I really love cashews and I would have been OK with even more, but they nailed the combination of flavors.)When I took a bite into the bar my 7 year old wanted to try it so I let her. On a child's taste buds she liked it at first bite, but after she had a chance to chew and swallow she was less enthusiastic and declined a second bite.I think this bar is for a more mature palate, but I suppose a child could get used to it. It's definitely satisfying and above all, I love that it's organic and gluten free!"
4,lots of date flavor,"This is a pretty good bar. With 190 calories (70 cal fat), 25g carbs, it is in line with a lot of the bars advertised as healthy. It is a bit sweet, in my opinion (dates, agave), but i think most people would find the sweet/ tart (cherries) mix well-balanced. i don't love dates, so i'm on the fence about buying this again, but if dates is your thing, it is the first ingredient. all the ingredients are food- understandable in english, organic, and uncooked. this is my first time experiencing a Pure Bar, and i'd feel pretty good about giving my kids this as a snack. i gave it 4 stars because the flavor is....just not quite what i think is delish, although pleasant enough."
3,Why Does Healthy Food Cost so Much?,"My review is the same as the Pure Organic Cherry Cashew. The bar is healthy and organic, but small and pricey. It is 190 calories and has low numbers in percent of vitamins. I recommend Quaker ""Oatmeal to Go"" This bar's taste is just ok. I expect more from the price."
3,Okay,"I can't say this is gross and I can't say it's awesome. It LOOKS nasty but I took that first bite anyway. I don't like the texture but I do like the cashews. There are cherries in it and they're yummy. I gave my 11 year old son a bite and he said ""ewww"". My opinion of it is that it's just okay. The price is too high and there's no way I would buy these, but it'd be great for people who are into this kind of thing."
2,Nasty...,"I opened this package to find a dense, nearly black bar with nut bits in it. As I held it up in my hand, I thought, ""Did I already eat this?""Needless to say, a bar that reminds me of a square of bear poop didn't really strike my fancy from the get go, but I was thinking maybe it would taste good even if it didn't look that great. But nope, it was bland and sour.I didn't like it. For 170 calories (if memory serves) I'll just grab a granola bar. Maybe its not perfectly organic or whatever, but I'll actually want to eat it, and when it comes to FOOD that seems to be a pretty important quality."
3,PURE Bar Organic Cherry,"It is difficult to judge food from one experience. I was sent one bar and tried it. I would not buy another one based on this single experience.The bar claims to be one serving of fruit. I believe that claim. I could taste the cherries and dates. I'd rather eat real fruit to get my serving. It tastes better. The bar is also gluten-free and kosher. A great snack alternative, but again it does not beat the real thing. It has 8 grams of fat, no transfat or cholesterol, low in sodium and high in calories-190. Again, have a piece of fruit. There is only one instance where this bar may be preferred to fruit, and that is if one is traveling for a period of time and cannot keep fruit for a number of days outside refrigeration."
2,another disappointing bar,I thought this would have some texture/crunch because of the nuts but it's soft & mushy. It is also oddly sweet. I do not recommend this bar to satisfy hunger or even have as a snack.
3,Ok for a protein bar.,"My annual ritual is to look in the mirror, decide it is time to shed my ""winter coat"", lose weight and eat better. This started last month and when I got the opportunity to order this, I jumped on it. Healthy, purely organic, who could beat that promise? Especially when I have tried several other protein bars, and found only one other that I like (Luna bar). Although I usually go for the chocolate/peanut butter because the taste and texture seem to be acceptable to my tastebuds, I thought that a cherry protein bar would be interesting. The bar wasn't too sweet (as a matter of fact, not sweet at all), and does offer a somewhat pleasant cherry taste. The only thing that I was not ""wild"" about was the texture, but true protein bar lovers, won't mind that at all. Did it satisfy me as a healthy snack? Yes, although I am not sure that I would run out and buy tons of them for my regular snack between meals, but as an occassional fruit treat, I will definitely consider it."
3,Okay for a health bar,"Upon opening the package I was really disappointed. It really looked terrible... so I was hoping the taste would be better. Well, I was disappointed there too. Cherry and Cashew DON'T seem to go together well at all! The texture was terrible! I guess if you are a health bar person... perhaps this would be a nice alternative to your typical bar. But since I'm not a health bar person, it REALLY, really grated against me."
5,Super Healthy and Yummy,"I am a real nutrition bar addict, loving the convenience, nutrition, and even the taste of many of the bars on the market. I personally look for a bar with protein and less than 30 carbohydrates. This bar fits the bill with 7 protein grams, and 25 carbohydrates along with 3 grams of fiber. I also enjoyed the pure healthy taste of fruits and nuts, they are sweet but not overly sweet and the nuttiness blends in to the flavor nicely. It has to be the most wholesome bar on the market. The ingredients are all organic and raw ,using cashews, cherries, rice protein, walnuts, agave nectar, and almonds. That's it, nothing cooked or processed. These bars are also gluten free, rich in omega 3's, and great for variety for anyone on a raw foods only diet, they are also vegan approved. They are good for you and as pure as it gets."
3,Average Organic Energy Bar,"The Pure organic bar is lacking in flavor but it is a good substitute for a meal if you are in a hurry or in need of a snack. It's moist and not crumbly like granola bars and while the flavor is bland, at least it doesn't taste awful like so many other energy bars.I am not a nutritionist nor do I go out of my way to eat healthy, but that this bar is certified organic and has a lot of natural products in it which is a plus.For energy bar, it'll do."
2,May be Organic but it's lacking in flavor,"I hate to give poor reviews but I have to say, I would not buy these. The blueberry bar was dry, dense and not very flavorful. The texture was grainy. It was NOT moist. I like granola bars, fig newtons, all of that stuff. I also like flavor. I didn't care for it and would not recommend it, to be blunt. Not much else to say. The wrapper was pretty, it was well sealed in a foil-type packaging, but the first bite was disappointing and not to my taste at all."
4,These are so much better than the cherry cashew bars,"I recently tried thePure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and didn't like them at all so I didn't get my hopes up for this flavor. However to my disbelief, I actually enjoyed the wild blueberry bars. It was a totally different experience for me. The mixture of fresh blueberry and nuts makes a great combination. I let my kids try a bite and then went on and on about how much they liked them. These bars are 100% natural without any added preservatives or artificial flavoring. I would recommend these for sure unlike the cherry cashew bars."
3,Tastes good,"This Wild Blueberry Bar with dates is nutritious and the taste of blueberry is very delicious. It is crunchy and fruity, but the sweetness of dates and crunchiness of cashews go very well together. I can not say you won't be hungry after eating one bar, because I felt like having another. Some reviewers have said that this is very sweet but I think this is just about right. If you like date and nut combination in snack bar then this is your brand."
4,"Great flavor, good for you","Same review as for the cherry bars - Typically, I only like to eat whole foods and until now, Lara Bars were it for me. Until now. These are amazing - really delicious and good for you, with whole food ingredients you can recognize, and they're made in Michigan! Fruits and nuts and honey - it doesn't get better than that. My kids loved them, too, which makes me happy because they're sweet enough to satisfy an urge for a candybar but so much better for you.The blueberry taste was real because the blueberries are real! The only icky thing in this bar was canola oil, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
2,nice but not so tasty,The ingredients are impressive and all...but the bottom line is... they taste badly.. Too bad!!
4,"Raw, but tastly","Tasty, raw, and portable.Pure is a brand I know and enjoy. This is another in a long line of great tasting products from this terrific company.I recommend it for folks trying to get kids to eat better snacks."
4,"Fresh taste, no hunger pangs, good stuff!","I've enjoyed other varieties of Pure Organics bars, and this wild blueberry & nut bar is no exception. Taste is good, fruits and nuts are well-balanced and sweet without being too sugary. They seem to keep me from getting hungry like some other less expensive bars do (Nature Valley granola, Neutra-grain, etc). I always check the price between Powerbars and these, and purchase whichever is cheapest, both fill the same need - flavorful, filling, and healthy alternative to a ""real meal""."
3,Just ok,"I was looking for a relatively natural, decent tasting, low glycemic index bar. These aren't very filling and don't taste that great. Given I am hungry a half hour later, I wonder if they are not low glycemic, or if they are just insubstantial.I find that I prefer either Luna Mojo bars which are low glycemic and much more filling or GNU foods Flavor and Fiber bars."
3,Mostly Tasty,This organic bar is chewy with the occasional nut and mostly grain tasting with some hints of blueberry with every bite. The taste is strong; this is not a bad thing or particularly a good thing as I seemed to have to take a drink a few times while easting a bar that comes in at just under two ounces.
4,Mixed Reviews,"Unfortunately I only received 1 Organic Cherry Cashew Bar, so I shared it with my father and my friend. The reviews were mixed. I really liked the tart and tangy taste and texture. It was very cherry-licious and chewy, so it made me feel more full than I really was after all that chewing. My dad, who is 88 years old and loves everything (foodwise)thought it was ""super"", while my friend Keiko liked the way it tasted, but she didn't care for the way it smelled. It reminded her of oatmeal. So, all in all we thought it was very good and we will definitely be buying more of these, especially since they are gluten free, organic and relatively inexpensive."
3,How do I title my review?,"""It tastes like a blueberry fig newton,"" my wife said.Different kinds of nuts dominate the bar. There's a slew of organic ingredients and the wrapper is almost boastful. It tastes...okay. Bitter, but not too bitter. It's hard to imagine anyone truly devouring it though. Imagine NutriGrain with the packed/raw flavor intensified."
4,Fresh and Wholesome,"Most gluten-free products taste like cardboard, so when I came upon this sampler, I was happily surprised. Measurably better tasting than sports' bars and gluten-free breakfast bars, this organic snack recharges your energy. Now don't expect a health product of this caliber to be inexpensive. However, I'm happy to report that PURE is very competitively priced at less than two dollars per bar.Surprisingly, I liked ""Cherry Cashew,"" over ""Wild Blueberry,"" but the variety can keep you more than satisfied.Nutrition *****, high in omega-3 and fiber, gluten-free, and organic.Price ***, You get what you pay for.Taste ****, So fresh, so good.Value ****, Seldom do you get everything together in one bar."
2,"Great ingredients, but flavor didn't trill me","I'm from Oregon and we grow a lot of blueberries in this state. This tastes to me like imitation blueberries (it includes ""organic blueberry flavor""). It's got great ingredients, but the flavor didn't trill me.On the other hand, I love the PURE ""Cherry Cashew"" bar...it is yummy!One word of caution: This product is certified gluten free and a proud supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation, but if you look closely there is small letters that say it is produced in a facility that processes wheat!"
4,Tastes good,"I'm not a cashew fan so I braced myself to be objective regardless of my personal likes and dislikes (it's a cherry cashew bar after all). To my surprise I found the taste of cashew was very faint as walnuts and almonds were the more prominent nutty flavors. That can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on how much cashew you wanted in your bar. What does explode is an incredible amount of sweet cherry flavor along with the fibrous texture common in health bars. It has enough sugar (via agave syrup and already sweet Oregon cherries) to equal a couple of chocolate chip cookies, frankly, but if you'd rather get your sweets from nature it's a tasty choice."
4,Good Tasting and Goof for You,"This is a pretty good bar. It has a real nice fruitiness to it. The cherry flavor is sweet-tart but not overly tart like a kids candy. For me, the cashews is what really wins me over. A 1.7 oz. bar provides 190 calories (8g fat, 25g carbs, 7g protein). Not bad. Compare to Odwalla bars that come in at 2 oz. and 200+ calories. Personally, I would like the bar to be a little bigger but, I often eat these bars either as a meal or while I am walking a round of golf so I want as many calories as I can get. The package is almost twice as long as the bar (marketing trick).Considering this bar is free of preservatives, trans fats, cholesterol, refined sugar, gluten, soy, and dairy it is pretty good. If you have an allergy to any of those things this is a good snack food choice."
3,Okay. Just Okay,"This mixed nut and fruit bar has a flavor reminiscent of blueberry-flavored instant oatmeal, and a not-unpleasant chewy texture. It isn't too sweet, as many such snack foods are. One was filling enough that I didn't find myself reflexively reaching for a second.But without wheat gluten, it's pressed together and bound with oil so it looks vaguely industrial from the package. It's so greasy that I felt the need to wash my hands after eating. And bits of nut got stuck in my teeth and hurt so badly that I had to brush right away.If I were on a gluten-free diet, I'd enjoy this snack. But for someone with no restrictions, it's just okay. I support organic, unprocessed, and healthy, but if I don't enjoy the taste, it doesn't exactly beckon me back."
2,"Tastes ok, but I wish it looked better, and cost less","First of all this has to be the single least appetizing item I have ever seen. Brown, mushy and studded with nuts... you get the idea.As for taste: it tastes mostly of dates, with light nut crunch and dried blueberry overtones. Its actually fairly complex for such a small bar and it does seem to fill you up. Its not spectacular but I like it.I took one star away for the appearance, the other two stars was removed for the price. At 1.73 per bar when you buy a 12 pack, this is way more expensive than it should be and does not strike me as something I would buy under virtually any circumstance. Of courst that might be because I am not on a raw food, or vegan diet, so I have plenty of other options."
3,Good for quick fiber plus energy boost,"The taste is good, with the blueberry predominating, followed by the nuts, and I tasted more walnut than cashew even though cashew was listed first in the ingredients list. The gluten-free bread is chewey and not too bad, just a little doughy/dry - quite acceptable with a glass of milk though! Nutritionally the bar is a bit high on carbs, moderate on fat and low on sodium. Better for hiking than home snacking IMO."
3,Good but not great,"The taste is good, with the cherry predominating, followed by the nuts. The gluten-free bread is chewey and not too bad, just a little doughy/dry - quite acceptable with a glass of milk though! Nutritionally the bar is a bit high on carbs, moderate on fat and low on sodium. Better for hiking than home snacking IMO."
2,Kinda like eating a 20 year old fig newton,"I had high hopes for this treat. It sure sounded yummy based on the description. HOWEVER, it was like the insides of a fig newton, but only after being left out on the counter for a couple of years. It had an unpalatable appearance, didn't smell very good,and didn't really taste much of cherry or cashew. It's fairly high in fat. I'm not very adept at describing flavors, but truly this had a kind of vague fruity taste that was at best non-descript. I had originally split my bar with my wife, but she took one small bite and set it aside. ""Maybe you'll like it,"" she said tentatively. I did not.I will never try another product from this company."
2,Pure Organic Natural Meh,"Pure hypes this as ""Organic, Vegan, 4 grams of fiber..."" and so on for a long paragraph. I don't really care. It looks like a candy bar or a snack bar and that's how I'll review it.It's not disgusting. I can taste the cherry. It doesn't have a noticeable aftertaste. And that's about it on the positive side.The negative side isn't large. The texture isn't pleasant. Although I could see the cashew chunks I didn't notice any cashew flavor - and I like cashew so that was a disappointment.It's nice to have the Omega 3s, vitamins and what not but I take supplements for those anyway and those aren't mildly annoying to eat.Summing up, I have little use for this but it wasn't bad enough to warrant a 1 star review. However, if you're heavily into the ""organic"" stuff this is worth looking at."
4,"Tasty, touch sweet, taste the cherry, like a compressed brownie","Not bad for an for a snack or energy bar. Soft and not overly crunchy or hard like some bars that require an effort to chew. A bit on the sweet side taste wise and the cherry is obviously present in taste, the cashew is seconday, more subtle. This is all burried into a dark chocolate brownie like bar. It is a little sweet for me, but I think if you're hungry for a light snack, half a bar could stop your snack attack. Seems good enough for a pre-exercise meal with reasonable digestion time."
4,"Tasty Date Bar, hint of Cherry only","This is a date bar, sure a date is fruit, but a very sweet and not very nutritious one. I still don't understand why dried apricots are not used more in fruit bars. Regardless, this date bar does have the taste of cashews and a satisfying crunch and goo too. The Cherry taste is pretty much non-existent."
4,Tasty but I liked the blueberry bar better,"This cherry and cashew bar is a small dense bar with the chunks of cashews clearly visible. However, unlike the blueberry bar which smelled like blueberries when you opened it, there's really no aroma noticeable from this bar. It's sweet, but not too sweet, with a slight crunch from the cashews and walnuts but little taste of cherries (though they are the third ingredient after dates and cashews). It's more of a chewy bar (versus crunchy) that (along with something to drink) makes a tasty mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. All the ingredients are listed as organic and you won't find any mysterious chemicals, strange ingredients, or added sugar.However, of the two bars (blueberry versus cherry), I liked the blueberry bar more - I liked the smell of blueberries and it seemed tastier."
3,Nutritious? Yes Organic? Yes Tasty? Well . . .,"While I'd certainly appreciate one of these if I was stranded on a desert island with nothing else to eat, it's highly unlikely I'll be picking up a pack of them anytime soon at the local grocery store. I found them to be a bit dry and not nearly as flavorful as I'd expected based on the raw, organic ingredients. For Vegans and those who need to avoid refined sugar, transfats, cholesterol, gluten or soy, etc. these are probably a good snack choice but I didn't personally find them appealing."
3,"Not bad, not great - choose the blueberry instead",I was not overly impressed with this flavor of raw fruit & nut bar. It was okay... not bad but not great. I don't think I would buy this flavor. There was a lack of nuts and the cherry and cashew flavors just did not seem to go together that nicely. The texture was fine (aside from the lack of nuts).The Wild Blueberry Pure Bar is definitely my favorite and worth seeking out. Cherry cashew - not so much. I still give the cherry cashew version 3 stars because it is organic and contains all recognizable ingredients and is pretty healthy.
3,Ruffage,"After I ate this bar, I didn't know if I liked it or not. I still don't know. On one hand, it's sweet and the blueberry taste is quite nice. On the other hand, it feels like it wants to be a granola or candy bar but it fails at both. It seems healthy, almost too healthy. Eating the thing made me feel like my colon was going to be very healthy afterwards.I think I'm going to say that I like it but it is a strange taste and I don't know if I can ever love it."
3,Good enough,"I tried two flavors and this Blueberry bar is second (compared to the Cherry Cashew). I usually love dried blueberries but perhaps this needed a little more sweetness to bring out the flavor. The texture is halfway between soft and chewy, which is OK. With a fairly good balance of fiber, natural carbohydrates, protein, and low sodium it makes a good afternoon snack."
4,Great flavor,"I tried two flavors, and this Cherry Cashew flavor is perfect. Not too sweet, with real dried cherries. Since the bar is all raw food, the texture is halfway between soft and chewy, not crunchy. Good enough to count as dessert."
3,too sugary for me!,"These tasted exactly the same as a cashew cookie lara bar, and don't have enough protein for someone who's trying to sate their hunger for very long throughout the day. make sure you have some protein with this if you want to be full for more than a few minutes."
2,Great Bar if you Have no Tastebuds,"Okay, taste is relative, but really this one takes the ... well if you don't have anything nice to say. From a nutrition standpoint, they are very healthy, but just be prepared, perhaps you'll want to buy one from a local store before you invest in a whole case!"
1,Send this product back to the design team,"This product should be sent back to the design team. Why?- Organic but tasteless- It should focus on one main ingredient, instead of mixing all kind of things- The nuts are too mushy, not crispy anymoreThe only positive thing is that it is not infused with sugar. The fruit juice sweetens it.Fix this product and let me review again."
4,A blueberry nut finds a great bar,"I love love blueberries and also love love whole foods and real food bars. This is a great find for me. It is made of: Organic Dates, Organic Wild Blueberries (With Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Canola Oil), Organic Cashews, Organic Almonds, Organic Unsweetened Lemon Juice Concentrate. As a fan of Larabars I look for quick on the go snacks that are not processed and have real pronounceable food in them. I wish the blueberry flavor would have been a little stronger, like their Cherry bar, but it is very muted. I will not replace my larabars with this one but I might add it into the rotation. They are great to throw into your purse for a snack so vending machines are not calling your name."
3,on the fence,"SO this is an unusual version of a healthy snak/power bar. Im slightly torn about the texture/taste and consistancy. Its not bad, and it not great.. more like.. ehhhh?! If your loking for something different, then this is it otherwise stick to what you already like."
4,More like a fig bar than cherry but good anyway.,"It's hard to determine a lot of things with a small sample of food except you like it, don't like it, and what the taste is like. I expected something different since this was a Cherry Cashew bar, but it was mostly dates, so it was more like a fig newton. The cherry taste came through a little, but the cashews were mostly wasted they may as well used a less expensive filler.Bottom line is I did like the bar, but it could be either made cheaper for what it is and still taste the same, or made better and maybe more expensive with more nuts, and more cherries. I think the only nut that would come through well with a bar like this is maybe the pecan. They might consider changing the formula a bit."
3,SATISFYING BUT NOT TOO TASTY FOR ME,"I really should state a disclaimer first - I'm a huge fan of sweets. So, while the taste of this bar is fine I still found myself looking for a sweetness.Having said that the bar was very satisfying and surely much healthier for me than my usual grab for chocolate. It is a rather small bar that really can be consumed in 3 - 4 generous bites.I was very pleased with the ingredients ( as was the person with whom I shared it. ) And while the label states that the bar might contain ""Pieces of nuts, shells, stems, pits"" - there were none in mine.We'll be ordering some of these as I continue to try to wean myself away from the ""super sweets"" with high fat content."
4,Healthy bar with great taste,"I am always looking for products that I feel good about putting into my kids' school lunches - that they will actually eat. This bar contains natural ingredients, mashed together into the bar, without a lot of ingredients added just for the convenience of the manufacturer. Its fruit/nut base makes it sweet enough that kids will eat it but also provide them with some essential nutrients instead of empty calories."
3,Strange snack bars,"These bars sounded good -- nice and healthy. They taste OK, but they're very chewy and sticky. I gave most of them away, and don't think I would buy them again."
5,fills you up !,"i have to say, i am not a big fan of cereal, snack or power bars. they usually taste like vitamins or something but these had a lot of flavor. they had the texture of fig newtons, sort of.they had a very rich taste of cherry and i ate them in the afternoon at my office.i also tried them 2 days for breakfast with coffee and orange juice and it really filled me up.actually, if i did that for about a month, i would probably lose weight.them being organic was nice even though i am not really into that kind of stuff.i have one in my purse just for emergencies. i really liked them and if i saw them in the store, i would buy a box or two.they were that good. they were soft and not chewy and they didnt' crumble all over the place when you opened them, like some cereal bars.this is a good buy and if you are looking for a middle of the day snack or a breakfast on the run item, this is it."
5,Delicious! Nutritious!,"This product may not be appealing in terms of looks, but it's delicious! If you've enjoyed Fruit Bars such as Larabar or Fruition, you're familiar with this style of energy-bar-like product.I haven't tried all the flavors, but I can say that the combination of cherry and cashews is delicious. Enjoy!"
4,Pretty good,These bars were rather flavorful for being a healthy product. I would recommend these bars to anyone trying to eat healthier.
4,Very Tasty!,Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Bars are very tasty. They are surprisingly moist with a hint of blueberry and lots of nuts. They actually reminded me of my grandma's banana bread with blueberries instead of bananas. Definitely worth a try!
2,Think You Could Eat Something Better,"I liked the fact that this bar was all organic, but hey does that mean that because it's organic, it gets a pass on taste? I don't think so. It was just okay. You can find better tasty and organic alternatives in my opinion that are not as pricey. I was not sure what to make of the texture which like one reviewer said, is not crunchy and is something like a fig newton bar. The bar itself is pretty small and for the calories, I think you can eat something else that would probably be less calories and more filling. I just was not impressed at all by this bar. Not sure if I would purchase if given the chance."
2,Not That Tasty,"I was a bit disappointed in the taste of this bar. The nut flavor was good and nice and crunchy, but it didn't taste anything like blueberries. It was kind of a gooey (or gluey), chewy bar with a taste that is hard to describe. Not a bad taste, but I doubt it's anything kids would like that much. I assume there is no added sugar, which is a real plus. I suppose it is good to be eating something natural, but why not just eat the nuts and blueberries separately instead of crushed and compacted into a bar? Convenience would be the only reason I can think of and these would have a longer shelf life than fresh blueberries. Great for campers or hikers who don't want a high sugar snack."
2,Healthy-ish. And gummy...,"I guess this bar is healthy...it has good ingredients. Not enough of any of the ingredients to get a good dose of what makes those ingredients healthy, however. For your nearly 200 calories you get almost no vitamins or minerals to speak of. There are nice chunks of nuts, but since they aren't toasted first they don't have that flavorful crunchiness. (And yes, I get that toasting would make this a NON-raw food, as if being raw is necessarily worthwhile, anyway.) The bar is just bland with some vague blueberry taste. Just brownish-purple gumminess with little pieces of dried blueberry and big pieces of raw nuts. It may have 6 grams of protein, but 190 calories aren't going to sustain you for long, regardless. My teenage son (who eats anything)took one bite and handed it right back. Frankly, if I'm going to throw away 200 calories on what basically amounts to an empty calorie snack, I'll find something more appealing."
3,snack,I received one bar not a package of 12 as per description.The bar was blueberry and nut and was an excellent 2PM snack!
4,"Healthy, Nutty-flavored Fruit Bar","This is my first time trying PURE fruit and nut bar. I don't know what I was expecting, maybe the taste of a regular trail mix bar. It's hard to describe what the PURE bar (strawberry flavor) tastes like, but it's not an unpleasant flavor. The fruity flavor is obvious, but the cashews are a little overwhelming. It's more like a cashew bar than a fruit bar.I like that the bar is soft and chewy, and not too sweet. Also, it's made out of all natural and organic ingredients, with nothing processed. That to me is worth having a bar that doesn't have the conventional taste of other energy bars. The taste is not bad, but it's not delicious either. However, the bar is filling and doesn't make you feel guilty about eating it, because the ingredients are so healthy. I would recommend these bars as snacks, but they do have plenty of calories, so I wouldn't eat too many of them at once. But that's true of any kind of snack."
3,It's a fruit bar - good snack,This is like a grown-up version of the fruit roll-up. It has good flavor and is organic. I would say more fruity than specifically cherry. The cashew pieces are finely chopped. I would have liked them to be bigger and crunchier. You could say it's a healthy snack and is if you need something tidy and packaged. A piece of fresh fruit with nuts or nut butter would be a better choice. But this is good for throwing in a back pack or other bag.
5,Tastes great -- and healthy!!!,"The most natural bar I've tried -- and I've tried dozens. The ingredients say it all. Flavor is also pretty good, so hard to find anything wrong with this. 5 stars!"
2,great before change,"These bars used to be very tasty and fresh. However, they were recently changed for the worse. I believe I read somewhere the company was sold to a larger company which may be the reason. Anyway, they no longer taste fresh. They are much more cardboard like. Previously they were dense, moist and fruity. Now they are dry and pretty much tasteless. I had been buying the apple cinnamon and the variety pack every month but I cancelled my subscription for both. Very disappointed!!"
4,pretty good for what it is,"I was trying to decide whether to give it 3 stars (it's okay, for a granola bar) or 5 stars (it's really awesome for a *gluten free* granola bar, since most have gluten or at least are at risk for cross-contamination.) I settled on averaging them. It tastes good and is sweet. The texture is kind of odd. My 11 year old son wants me to order more of them, he likes them better than Clif bars."
2,Thick and not very tasty,"Our family often eats granola bars, especially ones that are high in fiber. I was happy to give this little bar a try. While cherry is not my favorite flavor, I kept an open mind when trying this bar. I do really love cashews, so I thought the combination might be interesting and tasty. My husband an I both had a bite, and we both agreed it was too thick. It was not an enjoyable texture or flavor (even for my husband, who is a cherry fan). The cashew flavor was very subtle. If you are a huge fan of cherry flavored bars, you may want to give this one a try. Unfortunately, for our family, we will not be trying it again."
3,OK,I liked these. But I cant say they were anything out of the ordinary. Chewy and fruity. About what you'd expect from a fruit/nut bar. If you are into this it would be a good snack. I doubt if I would buy them on a regular basis.
4,Lots and lots of real blueberry flavor,"Tastes like a dense blueberry nutbread. Real blueberry flavor and lots of it. Pretty good, actually, as sampled by an 8 yr old, a 14 yr old, and two adults. Everyone liked it. Although th blueberry was a little overwhelming, the walnut came through, and the texture was pretty good also; like a dense nutbread rather than a sticky or taffy like protein bar. I'd get it again, but in small amounts, as it would be easy to overdo the blueberry flavor."
3,"Tasty, but with a bit too much flour-like aftertaste","The bar tasted fine enough in the eating, with the nuts adding a light crunch to an otherwise smooth bar. However, after finishing, there was an aftertaste of flour that lasted for a few minutes. It wasn't entirely unpleasant, but I certainly would have appreciated no aftertaste more."
2,Unpleasant,"I was looking forward to the taste of cherries. What I got was a dark, dense, unpleasantly non-cherry chunk that was slightly sour-tasting. It is something I might keep in my car on the offchance that I get caught in a blizzard and find myself stranded in a snowbank for three days. This bar would keep me alive ... and keep me opening the car door to swallow lots of snow in order to get the taste out of my mouth. Disappointing and not something I would recommend."
5,Yummy,I love cranberries & oranges and this blend of organic ingredients is absolutely delicious. I shared with my sisters and they really enjoyed it also.
3,Healthy Taste,"I shared my ""Pure Bar Organic Wild Berry Fruit & Nut Bar"" with my wife. Her first comment was ""Mmmmm"" and her second was ""Tasty"". Indeed it was (we both love blueberries). I found the bar very moist with a nutty crunch to it. As I continued eating the bare my wife insisted that she get another bite. A few days later she wanted to know the name of the bar because she was hungry and wanted to buy some. Unfortunately, new products don't get to our town all that quickly.I rated this bar ""***"" because there are so many foods that I consider better than this fruit bar. However, I have never before eated a ""natural health food bar"" that I enjoyed. I enjoyed the ""Pure Bar Organic Wild Berry Fruit & Nut Bar""."
3,"tastes okay, but not great","While I enjoyed eating the bar I received (both the cherry cashew and blueberry flavors), I have to say that I doubt I'd purchase these in any quantity. While the overall caloric content of these bars isn't bad (190 calories), the fat and carb content is high (naturally, given the nuts and fruit in the bars) and protein content relatively low. I already get plenty of fiber from whole foods and enjoy eating fresh fruit with yogurt, cottage cheese, and oatmeal as well as by itself, so I don't feel the need to up my intake of fruits by eating a bar like this. If only it had some added protein I might have been able to give it a higher recommendation."
4,Good meal replacement.,"I missed lunch and had this bar with me so I tried it. It tastes good, is filling and is an organic meal that includes fruit, protein and Omega-3s. I've just started a raw foods diet and this bar qualifies as raw food. I'll be buying more."
5,"If you like Kashi, I think you'll like these","It's interesting to see the spread of reviews on these bars - personally, I think if you're used to eating healthy breakfast bars (like Kashi), you'll probably enjoy these too. Obviously, being completely organic and full of everything that's good for you, it can feel there's something ""absent"" (i.e. everything that's not good for you), so I don't imagine this would necessarily be a big hit with kids and teens.Still, my wife and I shared the Amazon Vine sample today and really enjoyed it. As others have pointed out, at $2 a piece they're a little pricey, but that's cost of eating well - we'll definitely be ordering a box to keep on standby for when we miss breakfast or lunch."
3,Healthy snacking,"These Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are not the normal crunchy snack bar, but a date based bar with 190 calories each, so presumably they would make a good energy bar. They are gluten free with no preservatives, but the bar I had had an expiration date 11 months from the time I received it, so that is a pretty good shelf life for a natural no preservative food.Two of us in the household tasted the bar and thought it was tasty and fruity, it is chewy and soft. It has a slight blueberry taste with nuts taste, but the main taste are the dates, the nuts seem to be ground very fine. It does have a high price in my opinion for a 1.7 oz snack, but natural foods seem to have a higher price than the every day snack items So if it serves your needs and wants as a natural- gluten free - preservative free - 190 calorie snack it would be perfect for you."
3,Natural snacking,"These Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are not the normal crunchy snack bar, but a date based bar with 190 calories each, so presumably they would make a good energy bar. They are gluten free with no preservatives, but the bar I had had an expiration date 9 months from the time I received it, so that is a pretty good shelf life for a natural no preservative food.Two of us in the household tasted the bar and thought it was tasty and fruity, it is chewy and soft. It has a cherry taste, but the main taste are the dates, the nuts seem to be ground very fine. It does have a high price in my opinion for a 1.7 oz snack, but natural foods seem to have a higher price than the every day snack items. So if it serves your needs and wants as a natural- gluten free - preservative free - 190 calorie snack it would be perfect for you."
5,Excellent organic fruit and nut bar,"These bars are fruity, chewy, and have just the right amount of sweetness--not too sweet, not under sweet. The ingredients are all organic, and they contain nothing cooked and nothing processed, in addition to being gluten-free and USDA approved organic. This is a satisfying candy bar, which is likely due to the fact that it contains organic rice protein in addition to the fruit and nuts; that stabilizes your blood sugar so that you get the energy you crave from a candy bar without the resulting ""crash"" later on.I've tried both this variety and the Cherry Almond bar and like them both, although the cherry bar is my favorite. With all the benefits of raw foods, a candy bar like this is great. Unlike regular candy bars, these have lots of things in them that are good for you, so they're actually nutritious rather than empty calories. The name says it all; they're really pure and really good."
2,"OK, but not worth seeking out or buying.","The consistency of this bar is fairly typical, with a gummy texture whose dominant flavor resembles a slightly softened cherry ""fruit chew."" The cashew flavor is subtle and, in my opinion, not significant enough to be worth buying the product if that's your main interest. I've enjoyed many other bars much more: I'd eat it if it was the only thing handy on a long hike, but I would not intentionally buy it given the panoply of choices."
2,Organic Cherry Cashew & Nut Bar,"Well, I was excited about trying this product especially since I like cherries and cashews. When it arrived, I opened it up and took a bit (it arrived about mid-afternoon). I caught a little cherry flavor then cashew at first but it disappeared quickly and the next bit didn't help either. Sorry, but this is not very appetizing to my palette. I choose my caloric intake carefully and this just doesn't come up to a positive for me. Maybe another combination might do it!I would suggest a little more cherry flavor and that possibly through adding additional sweetner to the mix. The crunch, the cashews are just fine but the lack of continuing flavor not good."
2,"High on health, low on flavor","Okay, if you are a health nut or vegan, or into organics, this is for you. It's certified organic, gluten free, rich in Omega 3's, raw, and Vegan. It says it's a good source of fiber, but at 3 grams per serving, I'd say it's just an okay source of fiber.There are no refined sugars, no gluten, dairy, or soy, no cholesterol, no trans fats, to preservatives, or artificial anythings.There is also no flavor. Unless you like to eat cardboard, which I don't. Plus, it's about the size of my pinky, so you're not getting much.If I'm going to waste 200 calories on some kind of health bar, I'm going to make sure it tastes good. Cherry or blueberry didn't matter, it still tasted bad, and the other benefits for me, weren't worth the calories."
3,Much better than the cherry. Good fruit flavor.,"My whole family tried these adn the pure bar cherry bars at the same time. You can see my review for the cherry ones on that page, but I wasn't overly impressed with them. These, however, were quite a bit better. My whole family liked the blueberry ones, but even my 4 year old with a sweet tooth wasn't wild about the cherry bars.PROS:Nice texture. One reviewer said they were like a newton bar. I think that's pretty close.Great fruit flavor. The blueberry is pronounced, but subtle.Great nutrition profile.Subtle nut flavor, not overpowering.CONS:Still a little ""flat"" in the flavor department. I think a little salt would be a good thing.Still just slightly chalky after taste.Overall, these were good, but still had room for improvement, however, I would consider keeping them in my purse for a healthy snack now and then. I could recommend them."
3,"A Tad Dry, but Tastes Better than the Cherry Version","I ate this as a follow-up to the ""Wild Cherry"" flavor. The Blueberry version does not have the same sour taste, so it is much more edible. However, it is a bit dry. Admittedly, I did eat it while I was cycling, so being able to swallow it at all as a plus (as opposed to Clif Bars, which are easy to eat while inactive but difficult to eat while exercising). Still, I'd rather have a Luna bar."
2,There are tasty bars out there--this isn't one of them,"My kids usually love anything that has the words ""bar"" and ""fruit"" in it. But after a couple nibbles of this, they put them on the counter and said, ""I don't want this."" I tasted it and didn't blame them. It's bland, and just plain lacking. I didn't eat it either--it went into the trash. We tried both cherry and blueberry flavors--same reaction to both. I'd recommend Larabars instead of this if you're looking for raw food or bars with no added sugar."

I'd recommend Larabars instead of this if you're looking for raw food or bars with no added sugar."
4,Yummy but Oily,"The flavor of this cherry cashew fruit and nut bar is really tasty! The texture is pleasant and I appreciate that unlike many snack bars, it has a more chewy consistency. However, because it's chewy, it's also quite oily. I'm sure this adds to the flavor, but this doesn't ""feel"" like a healthy snack. Makes a great mid-morning or afternoon treat, though. I'd definitely eat another one or two!"
2,Way too tart for my taste,This bar has so much going for it. I loved how soft it was and the texture was great. I just personally did not care for the taste at all. Even with all the healthy goodness I couldn't force myself to finish the bar.
2,Too mushy and not very tasty,"The first and occasional taste of real blue berry made me keep trying another bite, but each time I did I became less satisfied with the bar. I was hoping that it would have been more like the KIND Fruit plus Nut Bar, which has a very satisfying taste and texture, but instead it was more like a chewy gooey unidentifiable powerbar with some nuts and fruit added. If you like the normal powerbar goo (which I do not), then this could be a good fit for you as the addition of the fruit and nuts could make it more interesting. It definitely felt like it would fill you up for the 190 calories, but I like to enjoy the food I it as well."
4,Very Natural Taste,"Like other reviewers, I would have liked to taste more of the blueberries in there. But it was nice to eat a bar that didn't taste like sugar or like it was processed to within an inch of its life. It's a bit on the bland side at first but when you acclimate yourself to eating food without all the extra sugars and artificial flavors, it actually isn't bad at all. It also really feels good to put something into my body that isn't going to slowly kill me."
4,Tastey but didn't care for the texture.,"The taste of the bar was good. Sweet, but not too sweet. Had a nice blend of fruit and nut tastes to it. What I didn't really care for it is the texture. I found it to be too wet and sticky for my liking. It is on par with a power bar, but I don't care for those either because of the texture.What also stuck me as odd is that besides having the standard warning that it is produced in a factory that handles nuts, fish and other allergens, there is a warning that it may contain stems and pieces of shell. Really? Ummmm, no thanks. I'll take my bar without foreign objects please. Just the fruit and nuts please. I suppose I am missing the point that the bar is raw food.End of the day - it was a tastey little bar. I think I will stick with my clif bars though. Equally yummy and they don't tell me that there might be sticks in there. Maybe I should give Pure Bar credit for honesty."
4,PURE BAR,"This individually wrapped organic snack bar with cherries, cashews, and other raw fruits and nuts is made with all natural ingredients. Two of the four people in my household said that they liked it well enough to purchase them. I just thought that it was, okay. Okay that is, if, you like eating a fruit-cake like snack. We all liked the cherry bar better than the blueberry one, but personally, I'd rather eat a serving of fresh fruit and a handful of nuts. However, this is a fairly good alternative when fresh isn't available."

5,Wild Blueberry,"These bars taste good, are healthy, have healthy ingredients, no soy, etc. When I read the ingredient content, and the fact that they are vegan, I had to try it. The bar is wholesome, raw, and really tastes good. The bar has a slightly sticky texture, but that's okay with me. Even though I will not list the ingredients, they do look good and healthy!Only one thing that might bother ""true"" vegans: this bar does not appear ""kosher"" as it is ""produced in a facility that processes milk, egg, fish, etc"". But that doesn't bother me, because that doesn't mean the bars ""touch"" milk, eggs, or fish - those machines could be far away (in the other side of the building) from the machines that produce these bars.But these bars do taste good and are healthy - therefore, you do not have to be ""vegan"" to enjoy them. Anybody can eat them."
3,Raw Vegan Energy,I liked it - it has an unusual blueberry taste mixed with dates and nuts. I had it for my breakfast today.
4,"Dark, moist and chewy fruit bar","At 190 cals this is no lightweight bar. Heavy and filling, it is not at all candy-like, granola-like, or even particularly similar to a cereal bar with fruit filling. The whole bar is a solid piece which reminded me of the texture of fruitcake, without the sense of biting off chunks of fruit. The nut pieces are small, but visible. I can imagine this being quite helpful to long distances hiked, biked or ran...and it would do as breakfast with a glass of milk.Notes: Labeled USDA organicCertified Gluten-freeRawVeganNO GMO, preservatives, artificial additives.After reading that, I'm thinking it would make a great addition to a toddler bag..."
4,tasty organic bar,"I try to eat organic whenever I can. I was found Pure Bar, in the organic Wild Blueberry flavor to be a very tasty organic option. The bar's ingredients are very natural, with nuts, dates, blueberries, agave nectar and some lemon juice concentrate. And none of it is cooked, it's all raw. The entire bar has a great consistency. It's not too sweet and it was rather filling as a quick snack or small breakfast. It isn't the lightest calorie snack you will come across, at 190, but it's healthy, organic and tasty."
4,tasty,"I tasted blueberries, dates, and walnuts. The texture was nice; soft with a little texture from the nuts, but not too chewy or crunchy. I was pleased to see that it supplied 1.5 servings of fruit.I thought it was very tasty and would recommend as a healthful snack food. It isn't filling enough or high enough in protein to replace a meal, but it is a nice alternative to eating junk food in between meals."
4,Very tasty,"I didn't expect to like this health food bar as much as I did, as I'm not a huge fan of cherry-flavored products, but was pleasantly surprised. According to the product page, it comes in a variety of other flavors, too, including wild blueberry, cranberry orange and chocolate. It's low in calories but higher in fat than some health food bars I've had. The taste of nuts and fruit was nicely meshed, and just one bar was enough to tide me over until dinner an hour later. It reminded me of a Fruit Roll-up bar flavored oatmeal cookie. I would definitely recommend them.If I had one complaint, I would have preferred more than one to sample, but the amount isn't influencing my rating."
2,Its ok,I am not big on energy bars or health bars. This does not taste that great. It is a good health choice but I like the fig nut-tons better. I overall think if you like organic or want a healthy snack this is fine. Since its all natural kids might like it.
4,Great Snack,"Ingredients:Organic Dates, Cashews, Organic Cherries, Organic Rice Protein, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds---and that's it!Considering the price of organics to make a quality product, I think the price is a deal! The taste of cherries is not strong and overpowering, date is the prevailing flavor, the combination of ingredients is, in my opinion, a great mix for a good flavor without being too sweet. For those who watch gluten, you will be happy to know this has none! Also it has no--refined sugar, cholesterol, trans fat, preservatives, color or dairy. I thinks it just nice to be able to have a decent tasting snack and feel good about it! Hope you enjoy yours as much as I. If you are really a stickler on ingredients their web-site is [...]."
5,Great Taste,"And the unusual thing is that it is full of natural ingredients as well. No HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup), thank goodness and no artificial preservatives. This is truly an all natural, organic and good tasting snack bar that won't play havoc with your blood sugar, has no cholesterol and no trans fats. Placing my order today for another dozen."
4,"Moist, dense energy bar","If you like a moist, brownie-like energy bar, that tastes more of nuts than blueberries, this is the one for you. It is very filling, with about 200 calories and about 1/3 fat calories, so a great post-work out boost. Because it is soft and moist, it may end up getting squashed, so I would recommend to handle them with care. Not a bad price for a bar with the organic ingredients."
4,"very tasty, good-for-you snack","I'll be the first to admit - I'm not well versed in the raw food movement. But, I do know a good thing when I taste it. And, I also happen to believe that the fewer artificial ingredients or excess (non-natural) sugars, the better.Being a ""Cherry Cashew"" flavor, I honestly expected a bit more cherry flavor to this bar. But, on first taste, it reminded me of a fruitcake - a nicely textured mixture of fruits (dates, cherries) and nuts. This definitely isn't your aunt's stale, hard fruitcake that is so often maligned around the holidays.These bars aren't cheap, and they're definitely not low calorie (190 calories per 48 gram bar). But given the all-natural form of these sugars, I'd think they're a much better snack nutritionally than even ""low calorie"" options."
3,hmm...,"The flavor of these bars is good, but the texture is a little weird. They're not at all crunchy or like a granola bar. It's somewhere between a power bar and a fig newton."
2,Not as tasty as I would've thought,"Well Cherry and Cashew hmmm sounds good right? Well mostly it's not either of these and has a high calorie, carb, and sugar content. I could live with that if it tasted better, sadly it just does not. For that high a calorie content, sugar content and carb content, I could have a nice dark organic chocolate bar with no added sugar that would be much healthier. It was not the worst thing I ever ate but not all that good either. I would not recommend it, or buy it if I was looking for something of this nature. It sure looked good, unfortunately in the taste department it fails, and as far as healthy its not all that."
5,"Nutritious ingredients, great taste-what more could one want?","These organic fruit and nut bars are exceptionally good. If you have a knowledge of ingredients, you will undoubtedly agree that these organic fruit and nut bars are a wonderful snack.If you find you are uncontrollably hungry, you will probably agree that these fruit and nut bars are a great thing to reach for. Fill up with great nutrition. At 190 calories, these bars are all 'good' calories-no junk here. The ingredients list is chock full of healthy, organic ingredients-no bad fats, no dyes, no pesticidesThis is an enjoyable taste treat-you will not be disappointed! Terrific!"
5,Delicious and no unhealthy fillers,"Unlike many energy bars, this delicious fruit and nut bar is not laden with corn syrup or other junk. The ingredient list on Amazon's web site is out of date. The main ingredient is dates, followed by cashews, walnuts, rice protein concentrate, then blueberries blended with apple juice concentrate, and sunflower oil. Then comes agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, and blueberry flavor. All the ingredients are organic. There is a good aftertaste, and the small serving size is a satisfying amount. Even though I don't care for dates nor walnuts, I still enjoyed the flavor."
4,Love This Bar for its Purity...,"...and have to say, it is about as good as fruit and nuts smashed into a bar can get. Having succumbed to the urge to say that, the price is high, even for an organic- and ingredient-pure snack. I keep trying these kinds of bars thinking one just might have some real texture and some flavor other than sweet and sweeter.On a more positive note, I hope the Pure Organic people keep at it. They're on the right track. I loved the ingredient list, that nothing in the bars is processed (other than being ground and how else would one make nuts and fruits into a bar!), that the makers support the celiac Disease Foundation, and that they are made in the USA.Will I buy them to eat again. Sure. When I travel. But I still hope Pure Organic will keep at it. Those bars aren't what one could call delectable yet. Maybe I'm hoping for miracles."
4,Gourmet Yummy,"Expensive for a 1.7 oz fruit & nut bar, but when you want something pure and tasty, it sure beats Starbucks!"
3,"Flavor was good, but the texture not so much","I really liked the flavor of these bars, but the texture was kind of grainy. The size was a little smaller then the average nutrition bar, but it was pretty filling. I really liked the fact that it is organic, because I do buy a lot of organic products. I just think they could improve a little on the texture."
4,"Good Raw, Meal Replacement Bar","Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Bars are a good, raw, meal replacement bar (at about 190 calories per bar). Like many raw bars, these bars are made from dried fruit and nuts, but unlike some other bars, this bar tasted mainly like the advertised fruit--blueberries--and not like nuts or other dried fruits. The nut pieces are relatively small--so they provide protein not taste. This bar was also sweeter than many other raw bars I've had (thanks to the inclusion of agave) so if you want something a bit sweet, this is a good choice."
3,Mona Lisa,Very natural and good for you. Has no presatives. Has real fruit and nuts. I like it because it is organic and gluten free.
3,Tasty candy bar,"This is essentially a candy bar. It is much better for you than most candy bars, and, in a pinch, can substitute for food. I split it with my 8 year old grand daughter who thought it was okay."
1,Ugh and double ugh,"I recently had my roof replaced, and afterward had to clean up the scraps of asphalt shingle left by the workmen. Had this snack bar been dropped on the ground among the trash, it would have been hard to spot.So, the Pure blueberry bar is not appetizing to look at. It isn't good to eat, either, presenting a mucilaginous binder holding together some not very crunchy nuts.It's appeal, if any, must reside in what the manufacturer claims it doesn't have: no refined sugar, no preservatives, no trans fats, no cholesterol, no dairy, no GMOs, no gluten and no soy. Since I don't object to any of those things, it has no appeal for me.I wouldn't eat one again, and my wife didn't like it either, so one star, but check also my review of the Pure cherry bar, which she did like."
3,A Raw Ingredient Mashup,"The manufacturer claims this bar is made with the most pure, untainted ingredients available. Pure's fruits and nuts are cold processed. The company says this means the ingredients retain more antioxidants and nutrients than than bars made with ingredients subjected to high temperatures. meaning the heating process that That much I really like. It's the putting of all those ingredients together where this bar falls a bit short.The primary flavor of this bar is supposed to be blueberry. However, the flavor of dates overwhelmed the blueberry. I happen to like dates so I was ok with the flavor. However, I expected a fresh, blueberry taste that simply was not there. Raw, organic ingredients or not, this is still a mass produced product with a lengthy shelf life. It is no surprise, then, convenience trumps taste."
4,surprisingly good,"I was surprised how good this tasted. It taste similar, though not exactly like it was fruit leather. It had just the right balance of nuts without seeming too much. Obviously taste will very, so you are probably best to try one before buying 12.Typically, Organic = Expensive. But for $20 you get 12, which i think is pretty reasonable priced for these. If you are into fitness or eating healthy, this may be something you really enjoy."
1,Not as good as described!,"Described as almost as good as a brownie, I had expectations for a superb bar. And this one is way too far from tasting like brownie or being tasty to start with."
2,"Weird smell, ok flavor.","I tried several of these bars, but I had to hold my breath to take a bite -- they smell terrible! Like vinegar or something. Most unpleasant. The taste isn't bad, but it ain't a chocolate brownie, I don't care what any of the other reviews say!"
2,Healthy and tastes like it,"The bar is healthy judging from the ingredients. I was looking forward to getting it because I love cherries and cashews. And, I'm always looking for a good health bar. But, I was disappointed when I tried it. In fact, no one in my family (two daughters and wife) really enjoyed it. It's rather dry and not very appealing."
3,Ordinary Energy Bar,Pros:Most reviewed energy bar in historyMoistNot too sweetNot too many caloriesCons:Not very interestingNot much protein
1,Ick!,"This bar is not tasty at all. The only positive thing I have to say about is that it is organic. That does not mean flavourful, however. I would much rather eat a handful of dried fruit and nuts than choke down another of these bars."
1,none of my kids would eat them,My one son loves Think Organic bars but he would not eat these. He didn't like them at all. I ended up giving them to the snack pantry at school because no one at our house would eat them.
3,A long shot from a brownie,"Whoever said this tastes like a chocolate brownie has been eating way too healthy for way too long :-) I, unfortunately, have not been eating healthy for that long and I am intimately acquainted with the taste of a real chocolate brownie and this is not even close! However, it is a good-tasting healthy snack or meal alternative. Just don't expect brownie and you'll be alright."
2,"For cherries & nuts, I prefer a handful of mixed dried fruits & nuts","Considering the ingredients, I'd rather snack on a mix of high quality dried cherries and nuts than on a bar that is mostly dates (note: dates are listed 1st in the ingredient list, with cherries 3rd). Dates are a fine fruit, but for a bar named Cherry Cashew, I expect, well, cherries & cashews!Though the flavor was OK, the crunch of nuts was totally lost in the heavy, chewy mixture that was the basis for the bar.The pre-packaged bars are definitely convenient (grab and go). Still, for my money, I'd prefer buying dried fruit & fresh nuts in bulk, mixing up a batch to my taste, then storing in small reusable containers to throw in the lunch bag or purse during the week."
1,not that good,"The main problem with the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, is that it doesn't taste like cherry or Cashew.It's made of just a few assorted nuts and a few assorted fruits rolled into a bar. And I'm not sure exactly what it tastes like. it's like one bar of flavor confusion. I can't tell what it tastes like.Maybe I would have liked it better had it actually tasted like cherry and/or cashew"
4,Tasty treat,"I liked it mostly because it has a nice balance to its taste--not overly sweet like some ""health"" snack bars , not too dry, not too chewy, and reasonably filling as well. At a buck and a half each, I think it's pretty competitive with most comparable bars. It has an assortment of vitamins--but not a whole lot of each one. Still its 190 calories, with 70 fat calories. It's certified organic by Quality Assurance International--even supplying an address & phone number. Good for me--no gluten or milk."
4,Very Tasty - and Organic!,"I have tried A LOT of bars and I've had some truly great ones and some truly awful ones. The PURE Organic Cherry Cashew falls close the great side of the spectrum. The taste is actually better than I expected. Many times the ""natural"" or ""organic"" bars tend to be dry or are barely stuck together raw materials. These were moist and in a bar form that doesn't crumble upon biting. My problem with this bar is its bang for the buck. I mean caloric bang for the nutrient buck and well as the 1.7oz size for the money. 200 calories for only 6g Protein and 4g Fiber seems like a lot to me. For a few more calories (240) you can have a 2.4 oz Clif bar with 12g Protein and 5g Fiber. Of course, bars - whether they are for energy, snacks, meal replacement or workouts are only good if you like the taste. If you're not after Protein and 200 calories is what you're after - these are good!"
5,Very surprising,"Usually these types of products are dry and tasteless. Not so in this case. After enjoying the bar completely , I was left wanting more. Very tasty ."
5,Love it!,"Two favorites, nuts and blueberries combined in an organic, not too sweet energy bar. Highly Recommend."
3,I didn't really like the flavor of this or the texture,"I wasn't too thrilled with the flavor or the texture of this bar. I think the blueberry flavor was better. This one was a little too sweet for my taste. The texture was a little grainly as well. I like the fact that it is organic, but I think there is room for improvment."
1,Naturally Awful.,"I love blueberries. I love Luna bars, but this bar was terrible. Just terrible. The texture is that of a wet power bar. The taste is bland or awful, I am not sure. This was so terrible I spit it out. This is so terrible, I am not even going to keep typing about it. I am not kidding."
2,3 of 4 of us didn't like it,"I was surprised to see ""rice protein"" I don't know if it's as bad as I think it is, but none the less, I didn't like the bar at all. Three adults and one 3 year old split a bar. My adult daughter and I didn't even finish our 1/4 of the bar. Only the 3 year old ate his. I've had other fruit and nut bars from Amazon and they were OK. I haven't been crazy about any of them, but his one I actually didn't like at all."
3,Has cross contamination problems. Processed in facility....,"Safety InformationAllergy Statement: This product is manufactured in a facility that processes foods that may contain peanuts, tree nuts, soy, dairy, wheat, or eggs. Product contains walnuts, almonds, and cashews. May contain pieces of nuts, shells or pits.For those of us who have celiac disease (gluten problems) or wheat allergy the cross contamination issue is very real. The warning says it is created in a facility that processes wheat and other common allergens.It looks good and sounds great until you read or notice the allergy warning. I just wanted to emphasize the cross contamination issue which is serious. That one point does not make it gluten free."
1,"Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar",good idea but no real flavor and not filling in anyway and what cashews? I didn't see or taste any.
1,poor customer service,I ordered the bars to take on an excursion with a group from the sierra club to west texas. I ate one bar and realized there was an ingredient that caused me to break out. I emailed and eventually called customer service and over the course of a month was asked to jump through hoops sending my amazon invoice and then resending it... I followed like a blind puppy and finally realized it was all a show. I'd have to rank the customer disservice with my very worst experiences. I think customer service is the face of a company and how they deal with their customers speaks volumes about their mission. Pure Bar is pure bunk....but amazon on the other end of the spectrum is AMAZING
3,Walnut taste overpowers cherry and cashew!,"This should be called a cherry/date/walnut bar, because I can't even taste the cashews! I love cashews and hate walnuts, so if I'd realized that they had walnuts in them at all I wouldn't have selected this one. The name is misleading. As far as chewy texture, they are easy to eat."
3,Not bad or good,"I got these because I wanted something to take with me that wouldn't melt. This bar does that job. I also got these because the ingredients are organic and simple--no additives and especially becuase they didn't have any sugar in them. The flavor names sounded so enticing, but truthfully they all tasted quite similar, with only slight differences in taste. They do not taste bad, but they aren't especially tasty either! I will continue to purchase these for their portability until I find something else with similarly simple ingredients and no sugar. I love it that they are sweetened with Agave nectar!"
5,Pure bars are delicious!,As a Naturopathic Doctor I am very aware of the food I put in my body. I'm also conscious that eating small amounts of food all day long instead of three meals is better for the body and keeps the energy level even. These Pure Fruit and Nut bars (organic! raw! vegan! gluten free!) are full of protein. All the flavors are delicious so get the variety pack. I highly recommend these.
4,"Good bar. Liked it, but not my favorite","I liked the blue Blueberry flavor bar, and particularly moreso than the Cherry flavor bar.On the whole, it was a pretty good bar, but I didn't like it as much as an Odwalla bar or a Luna bar. Still good, though.Pro: Cost is better than some of the other bars for sale. I did really like the blueberry taste too -- not the artificial taste you frequently get with these sorts of things."
3,"OK, but not as good as some","I didn't particularly like the Cherry flavor bar. I DID like the blueberry flavor bar, though. I just didn't find the taste to be that good.On the whole, it was a pretty good bar, but I didn't like it as much as an Odwalla bar or a Luna bar. Still good, though.Pros: Cost is better than some of the other bars for sale. Also, it is pretty tasty one the whole, and filling. It also lacked the ""artificial"" taste you sometimes get with these sorts of bars.Cons: I found the Cherry flavor to not be very ""Cherry-like""."
2,Rancid Nuts,"Upon first bite I thought I was eating a Fig Newton. I looked for the blueberries but could not taste any. What I did taste were rancid nuts. Maybe the fact this contains no preservatives (a good thing) and maybe because the bar is very moist had something to do with the nuts going bad quickly. If you want blueberry taste you'll be disappointed. If you like Fig Newtons you'll like this bar. If you know what rancid nuts taste like, you will not enjoy this bar."
2,Lots of rancid nuts,"Looks like I was not the only one who got a bar with rancid nuts. I took two bites and could not finish it. The only thing that saved it from one star was that I could actually taste the sour cherries. It's a dense, moist bar with soggy nuts. Not sure if I would give this another chance."
3,Basic fruit bar,Basically this bar tastes like a fig newton without the pastry outer layer. That's what it reminded me of.I guess if you are craving something sweet and nutritious this might be the way to go. I wasn't excited by it.The cherry taste was good though. I'm not into fruit bars much but I can't fault this product.I've tasted better fruit bars such as the PROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar.
4,"Tasty, but not blueberry taste","There are so many ""energy bars"" around. My preference is for the more moist variety. This bar is moist but has plenty of crunchy add-ins. The initial smell when the package is opened isn't especially attractive, doesn't remind me of blueberry at all. Same with the taste. Pleasant but not especially a blueberry taste. I probably would not go out of my way to choose this brand, but I wouldn't avoid it either."
3,Tastes good...for a health bar.,I have definitely had worse. My wife said she would not eat another one. If I was one a health kick this would be a nice afternoon snack.
3,"Tastes fine, but price is way too high!","Taste: The cherry flavor is good. I didn't have any issues with the taste. I didn't get any bad aftertastes and it wasn't a hard nut bar, so it would be easy for people with sensitive teeth to chew. The cherry taste is one of those that is good once in a while, but it isn't a bar you'd want to eat every day.Cost: We typically buy Clif Bars which cost about $1 each. These bars on Amazon are about $1.50 each. To me that's a big difference for a similar size bar.For me, the cost wins out over the flavor--which is just okay. I would only want one of these bars about once a week. So, I would recommend buying one or two from a store near you, but not a whole box."
5,Tasty and good for you!,"As a vegetarian who is always looking for a good snackbar or meal on the go bar that has some protein in it,and if its organic thats even better. I was thrilled to see this on the Vine newsletter. I have't seen this in a store and anxiously waited to try it out.One reviewer said it was too ""wet"".. It IS moist but not bad. I love Soyjoy and those are as dry as month old fruitcake. The moistness of the Blueberry Pure bar is a refreshing change.The taste of this bar isn't bad IMHO, its just not filled with sugar or chemicals. It tastes like nuts and blueberries, exactly what it is. I quite enjoyed it actually,but then again I can eat lettuce with nothing on it and enjoy it. If you are used to sugar filled bars like Luna bars then this will probably disappoint your palate.I can't wait to get a box of these and try out some of the other flavors too."
4,healthy snack - a decent afternoon hunger buster,"I have to admit, I was hesitant that this would be yet another very bad tasting ""healthy"" bar but after reading the ingredients as all organic, i decided to give it a try. I couldn't really taste the blueberry, but it had a decent nutty flavor and not as ""ick"" as other bars I've tried. it's not over loaded with sugar and ingredients that I can't even pronounce, which is a huge plus in my book!I like that it is gluten free and all organic. it's a decent, healthy snack to keep in my desk drawer at work for those afternoon hunger pangs. that and a bottle of water are a nice healthy snack."
2,Healthy and vegan ingredients but the taste and texture of a date bar,"Pure organic, nutritious, vegan, and all natural fruit ingredients. The only tricks up this bar's sleeve is that the main ingredient is dates (and it mainly tastes like a date bar) and the nuts are ground so fine they seem to add no texture, or taste, or crunch (all of which would improve the bar). If your primary goal is a filling and healthy snack that doesn't taste bad, it will do the trick if you like dates. For me, I'd like more flavor and texture as well. In this line of bars, I prefer the Pure cherry/cashew bar which also has a strong dates flavor but the cherries stand out more and the cashews are ground large enough to add a bit of texture and crunch to the bar."
2,Not likely to purchase,"Nutrition Information:Calories 190fat Cal 70total Fat 8gcholest 0mgfiber 3gsugars 17gprotein 7gThe packaging is enticing, I'd at least pick it up in the grocery store to look at since it's organic. But, it is pretty high in calories for such a small bar. The consistency was like a very thick fruit roll up (very sweet and chewy) with chunks of cashews throughout, which was the only part I liked. It was too heavy for me. I'll stick with some of the other bars lower in calories if I'm in a pinch (really enjoy Luna bars)."
3,Love that this is Raw,"I love that this bar is made from raw foods!! I've been trying to incorporate raw foods into half of my diet. For this, the bar earns 5 stars.The taste takes some of this away. I've prepared raw foods. I've sampled many raw foods prepared by others. I know they can taste awesome. The taste of this bar was just meh. Not offensive. Not drool-worthy. Just meh.Otherwise an excellent source of nutrients. Maybe I'd buy it if it were on sale & I was in immediate need of such snack. Otherwise I'm better off with my home-prepared raw snacks. Good attempt though and it's far healthier than many of the snack bars on the market."
3,Organic with Flavor,"I shared a ""Pure Organic Wild Blueberry raw fruit and nut bar"" with my wife. Her first reaction was, ""Ummmm, tasty"". My sentiments exactly. I noticed the moist texture of the bar and the light nutty crunch but mostly it was the flavor that sold me. As I tried a couple of more bites, my wife insisted that she gets another bite as well. The after taste was very nice since my wife and I both love blueberries. Why only 3 stars? Well, there are things that I enjoy eating more than this Pure Organic bar and I have to leave room for them on my scale. However, I would buy this if I find them in the grocery store and that is something I wouldn't say about any other ""organic bar"" I've ever had before."
4,Good but Expensive,"These bars have a good taste, smell and texture. Not great, but definitely good. I found the blueberry taste a bit lost. Not too sweet and yet they did appease my sweet tooth. There was no adverse after taste. They are quite dense and moist and very satisfying. If not for the price they would make a very good workday snack."
4,Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry,"The blueberry flavor was very subtle. I have never had a raw bar before, but I have eaten raw foods. As you would expect it does have a crunchy/chewy texture because of the fruit and nuts. Overall, what I like most is the light snack feeling that you don't get from other heavy bars. Easy enough to digest, would definitely put a few in the grocery cart next time I'm out shopping. Because of their soft texture, definitely don't want to leave this in a warm place as it might become gooey."
2,Not for me,"Sorry, but I don't ""get"" this product. It's not horrible tasting, but I'd much prefer a regular granola bar. It's certainly not appetizing to look at. If you want some fruit and nuts. . . have an apple and a handful of almonds. ;-)"
1,I'd rather go hungry than eat this.,"Okay, these are good for people who are on gluten-free, kosher, vegan, or soy-free diets, and they do have vitamins, but the taste is very bland. The bar is all natural--organic and raw. The cherry tasted like some kind of strange after taste instead of cherry. I'd rather go hungry than eat this."
3,"tastes okay, but i'd rather eat whole fruit","While I enjoyed eating the bar I received (both the cherry cashew and blueberry flavors), I have to say that I doubt I'd purchase these in any quantity. While the overall caloric content of these bars isn't bad (190 calories), the fat and carb content is high (naturally, given the nuts and fruit in the bars) and protein content relatively low. I already get plenty of fiber from whole foods and enjoy eating fresh fruit with yogurt, cottage cheese, and oatmeal as well as by itself, so I don't feel the need to up my intake of fruits by eating a bar like this. If only it had some added protein I might have been able to give it a higher recommendation."
2,"Nothing cooked, nothing processed, nothing could taste worse...","I'm sorry, I'm usually down with the organic food stuff, but these bars just don't taste very good. They're reasonably healthy (though each small bar still has nearly 200 calories), but they're bland, dense and vaguely sour (when I described the bar that way to a friend, she said, ""Well, you are what you eat."").So I'm not a fan. You might like it, but I sure don't."
2,Tasteless to me,"This bar contains only good (not processed) ingredients with dates and cashews first and second in the ingredients list. However, I thought the bar was tasteless and slightly sweet. At 190 calories a bar (70 fat calories), it is not something I would purchase because I felt unsatisified after eating it."
2,"Too Sweet, Mostly Dates","I got excited about these but upon tasting all the flavors and reading the labels, not so much. They are mostly dates and all taste the same, good at first, but you get tired of them quickly."
1,Yuck,"What an unpleasant taste and texture! This is a little brown bar, very flat and solid, and it tastes like compressed fruitcake, only not sweet. It smells and tastes like some kind of dried fruit. What is the sweetener here, prune juice? IS there a sweetener here? It's foods like this that give ""natural foods"" a bad name. Cherries and cashews are delicious--how did they get THIS bar out of those delicious foods? This was gross, I'm sorry."
2,I'd rather have a Lara Bar,"I was starving in between breaks at work. I went across the street to buy something that would hold me over until 7pm. I have never tried Pure bars until today. I am a big fan of Lara bars and by looking at the packaging, assumed they would be similar. They are quite similar using only a few ingredients, pure bars have higher sodium and added sugar (in the form of agave nectar).This is for the cherry cashew bar. The texture is rather grainy and left my mouth very dry. It does have larger pieces of nuts, whereas Lara bars (cherry bar) are more finely chopped. Overall i prefer the flavor and texture of Larabars and the fact that there is no added sugar, which is completely unnecessary. I will make sure to carry a Larabar with me from now on, this was not worth my $2.00!"
1,"Simple ingredients, but poor taste and texture","This bar may have simple ingredients, but I could not deal with the taste (not sweet enough for me). Also, the texture was as though the nuts and fruits were just pressed together as opposed to the consistent chewy texture of other bars."
2,Lingering Aftertaste,"When I taste tested Holland based Pure Bar's Organic Cherry Cashew Energy Bar, it brought back memories. Memories of a taste long buried and almost forgotten. That is until now. My beloved aunt's family tested and terrible tasting homemade fruitcake.This moist and overpowering concoction of organic dates, cherries, walnuts, agave nectar, almonds, cashews, and brown rice protein is overpoweringly sweet to me. Low sodium and certified Kosher, one Cherry Cashew bar packs 200 calories, 26 grams of carbohydrates, 9 grams of fat, 4 grams of fiber and 14 grams of sugar. Not necessarily diabetic friendly.Normally I am a big fan of energy bars. Its rare that I come across one that I cannot finish. The 1.7oz Pure Bar Cherry Cashew edition similarities to fruitcake cannot be dismissed. Nor can its lingering aftertaste. Like other products in this company's line up of protein bars, this is one that I cannot recommend."
1,Bleah,"This raw fruit and nut bar is rather gluey in texture and has no particular taste except sweet. There are 190 calories per bar of which 70 are from fat. The foil wrapper has a rather scary warning printed on it that the bar may contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits."
3,good enough,"Like a lot of similar bars, a heavy taste, very solid and natural. I prefer granola bars but this was a decent change of pace. And I'm partial to cashews. A better-than-most entree in the organic snack/energy bar field."
3,not too shabby,It was edible. Not the greatest but not bad. Healthy product. Good for you. I would recommend this to a friend.
3,Wish I could tell you more.,"I wish I could tell you more, this item never came. Maybe UPS ate it. I can ask them to write a review."
3,A fine bar,"Nothing exceptional about this bar; much like most others out there already. Has the consistency / texture of a ""zone"" or ""balance"" bar. Not to thick and heavy, on the light side."
2,Not expected from previous reviews,"I must say that we were disappointed in the overall product in terms of pretty much everything. Taste, texture, smell. The previous reviews seemed to be good and we really purchased this based on that. These reminded us of those very first ""health"" bars that were popular in the late 70's early 80's. Won't be a return purchase for us.On the other hand the ""Kind"" brand Apricot/Macadamia bars are at the opposite of this review and we highly recommend them."
3,"5 start in ingredient quality, 2 star in taste","For any person who cares about eating healthy, but likes to get their sweet cravings taking care of, these fit the bill. The ingredient list is very impressive, all organic, no refined sugars, and a short list.The bars are very sweet - even without refined sugars added, it is too sweet for my tastes.Superb ingredients, but too sweet and not my type. It might be an aquired taste - it is unlike any other bar you've eaten including: power bars, odwalla, granola bars, etc) it's soft, chewy, and very moist.If you kids like it - it's a much better alternative that other bars."
2,Weak Blueberry Fig Newtonesque Lump,"I'm a big fan of blueberries and this bar does not do them justice. From the product description, ""We specifically choose apple juice-infused (not sugar-infused) wild blueberries to avoid refined sugars"", which is a shame because blueberries are naturally sweet. The texture is similar to a Fig Newton, slightly chunkier, but still not appetizing for me.For the nitpickers out there, they also claim the product is gluten, soy and dairy free, but then state it is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish and tree nuts. Oh well, I suppose in our ""economies of scale"" world maybe it's impossible to produce items without having them contaminated by unrelated ingredients and the hyper-sensitive part of our society dictates these have to be called out. Too bad. I think I'll stick to dried blueberries and a bag of granola which are both healthier, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than this bar."
2,Only Good,"This bar is not the best but it is not bad at all. The flavor seems just like other Kellog's bars, I can't really taste the ""organic"" difference. I have tried other organic bars sold at Whole Foods and I could really tell the difference in flavor.What I don't like about these bars is the PRICE ! They are very expensive compared with other similar products. I cannot justify to pay this much for a bar which flavor is almost similar to store brands."
2,"Very tasty, but dry. SO dry.","This is a very tasty bar, and it feels like it has a full serving of fruit and nuts, so that's good. But Lord, is it DRY. And a bit overly sweet. I don't think I could eat a whole one, and certainly not unless I had eaten something else first. Have a glass of water at hand, or just have something else to eat."
3,"Fair, but not amazing",The cherry cashew bar was pretty much exactly what you would expect of an all natural nothing extra snack bar. Small and not terribly attractive to look at it tastes ok. I actually thought it was a little salty and chewy.
4,a little too sweet,"The ingredients in this bar are organic and healthy. The texture is a little odd: It's not dry and it doesn't have that cardboard characteristic a lot of organic foods have, but it is kind of sticky and gooey. The sweetness from the fruit sugars in the bar is overpowering and a little cloying. You can't even really taste the blueberry over all the other ingredients. For an organic bar, though, it's quite good. At 190 calories it's not quite a meal, so pairing it with something less sweet to make it a meal would be ideal. The price is, unfortunately, a bit steep, even a little more than other organic bars I have seen locally."
4,"Good, but not as good as the cranberry-cashew variety","This bar was pretty good, but I didn't like it as much as the PURE cranberry cashew bar. The problem was that the taste was a bit bland, and I really didn't get a lot of blueberry flavor. However, the nuts in the bar improved it.The bar has the consistency of the fig filling in a fig cookie; it is not reminiscent of cardboard like some other health bars. The ingredients are amazing, and the bar is satisfying."
1,Maybe vegans will like it?,"Upon opening the wrapper, I noticed that the inside of it looked as though the bar had sweated profusely while on its trip to my home. Not a promising sign. The bar itself looked very unappealing, like something that had been made with an industrial extruder into which someone threw blueberries, oats and other healthy-type food. At least it smelled edible. The bar is definitely blueberry flavor, but with a twist. Imagine if you had a piece of blueberry pie while you were out at a nice hillside picnic. Now imagine that you dropped your pie piece and it rolled down the hill and into a nearby forest, all the while collecting dirt, leaves, twigs and other detritus. Now eat that pie. That is what this bar tastes like."
5,"Finally! A bar that is not only healthy, but tastes good!","I like to have a bar to carry in my briefcase during the work day in case I have to eat a late lunch, need an afternoon snack, etc. Most taste like one is eating a bunch of chemicals (which they usually are). This one actually tasted like I could have made it at home. It was chalk full of nuts with a strong blueberry taste coming through. I knew what all the ingredients were and didn't need a chemistry degree to read them. Best of all for me, as I have high blood pressure, was no sodium. I will definitely be buying these again!"
3,Good,"This review is based on a sample provided through the Amazon Vine program.I like blueberries. This bar has real blueberries in it, and tastes like it. How can you go wrong? Well, you can't really. They're good, but you do need to remember that they are snack bars. They are pretty small."
4,Larabar > Pure,"This product reminded me a lot ofthis similar item by Larabar, and although I must say this tasted pretty good I liked that Larabar version a bit better (I feel like Larabar had a little more flavor). Overall not a bad product, but if this was sitting next to a Larabar ""Cherry Pie"", I'd grab the Larabar."
4,"Finally, a healthy, nutritious energy bar","PURE appears to be the exception to a trend in energy bars; rather than being empty calories, it is genuinely nutritioous. My only complaint is minor; I think it could use a handful more of cashews for a chewier consistency. Flavor is subtle, not the typical sugar rush of chocolate-covered bars.The PURE bar itself has a slightly sticky texture, but it should backpack well. I am not troubled by the slightly bitter aftertaste, which disappears immediately after a sip of any beverage.I have not yet found this product at local outlets. Amazon will be my main source for the moment. I think PURE is a definite buy."
4,A lot like Lara Bars,"Except for the actual shape, I think these are almost exactly the taste and texture of Lara Bars. They are organic, which I don't think Lara Bars are, but they are made out of whole, raw foods like cashews and other nuts. They get their sweetness from things like dates. Overall, I like them, but am not wowed by them. Personally I am more of a chocolate fan..."
3,Not RAW enough,"My initial impression was that this bar has the essence of Fig Newtons. The base texture is soft and dense and tastes of dates. The chopped nuts add a nice amount of crunchiness, which is assuaged by the chewiness of dried blueberries. It's not very sweet, which I don't mind, but I felt like something was missing (salt?) - the flavor never moved past the middle of my tongue. I'd sum up the flavor by saying that it was inoffensive.While I understand the convenience of having an individually-wrapped bar in your bag, I would rather eat a handful of nuts and dried fruit - it certainly tastes better, is closer to a raw and unprocessed food, has less impact on the environment, and costs less."
3,Just Okay,This is a blueberry bar but Blueberries are well down the list of ingredients. All the ingredients are pureed and then formed into a rectangular shape. It's the hot dog of fruit bars. The taste is okay. I could see bringing it on a hike where it might hold up better than the more standard blueberry bar. I know that it is organic and not processed but the consistency and the shape give it the appearance of something heavily processed.
3,Raw Fruit and Nut Bar,"Sufficiently sweet, this snack bar tasted mainly of dates and walnuts. There is a tang to it that I would attribute to the cherries. The texture was slightly mushy and a little gummy, much like dried dates, which contribute the overriding flavor and are the first ingredient listed on the packaging. The nuts were good, and saved the bar from a lower rating. The calorie count was 190, with 25 grams of carbs and eight grams of fat, similar to a candy bar.This bar is organic, raw, and gluten free. Overall this bar is acceptable as the taste is passable and it would satisfy hunger. It would be fine for backpacking or travel, and might be an answer for children with allergies wanting a snack.For what it is worth, here's my advice. When traveling, pack up some dried dates and walnuts in a baggy, and eat those instead. If you are home, eat a piece of fresh fruit and some nuts, and skip the unremarkable tasting packaged bar."
3,"Sorta Healthy, OK taste",This bar has a rather odd soft texture and an earthy but pleasant nut taste with only a hint of blueberry. It seems as though it may be somewhat healthy but overall I can't get too excited. I would rather just have a few roasted almonds and dried apricots for example which would be equally healthy and just as tasty.
4,Nice flavor,"I liked this bar better than the blueberry (see my other review). This has a nice cherry flavor that can be detected. I like that it is organic, and the price is very comparable to other non-organic bars."
4,fruity snack,"The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew fruit and nut bar is a refreshing alternative to sugarry snacks. It is not meant to be a meal replacement bar, or a fruit snack confection but does have some attributes of each.It contains the vitamins and minerals of fruit, the protein and crunchiness of nuts.It is more moist than meal bars, has no added sugar and natural flavors.Camparing it to the Pre blueberry bar, the cherry bar has a more subtle fruit flavor."
2,Not for me,Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew raw fruit and nut bar is not for me. It was like eating an unbaked blob of dough mixed with bits of nuts and tart unripe cherries. I would rather eat a cherry pop tart than this.
1,"Yuck, with a capital Y","Yes, it may claim to be all organic and such...but, yuck! This is the worst bar I have ever had. I am always looking for a good, healthy, organic AND tasty bar, but this...tasted like cardboard, with a nut here and there. I have eaten two of these, and the first one was so bad that the second one made me gag. I love theClif ZbarandKashi. They are tasty, this is not.Although the list of ingredients sounds good (health wise) and the flavor says cherry chashew, it asll tasted disgusting to me. If you are looking for a vegan/organic bar that actually DOES taste like what it is supposed to be, check outPROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar, Strawberry. The Fruition is seriosuly yummy. With a capital Y, the good Y."
4,"Tangy, Chewy and Stick to Your Ribs.","Fruit and nut concoction that is both delicious and nutritious with large pieces of nuts and an overall cherry flavor throughout a bar that is nicely tangy. I also think the decent protein and fiber content (7 and 3 or 4 respectively) made it a nice stick-to-your-ribs snack. I have tried the Pure Wild Blueberry Fruit and Nut bar, too, and I think I like the Cherry better due to the cherry flavor throughout the bar. The texture is very much Larabarish if you've had those before. (If not think thick fruit leather with nut chunks.) If you have allergies it does have a standard allergy warning covering lots of allergy issues including peanuts."
3,Cherry Cookie Dough,"If you like the taste of cherry you will like the taste of this fruit and nut bar. The matrix is the consistency of cookie dough. For me, the flavor was too shrill and acidic, but the nuts tasted fresh. If you are an alkaline person who loves sour pickles, this bar will appeal to you. At almost 200 calories, 70 of them fat, I found it too small to be worth the bother."
4,Enjoyable,"This tasted much better than I thought it would. When I first opened the package, it didn't look very appetizing. However, when I ate it and began to taste the sweetness of the blueberry, it immediately became enjoyable for me. This would be a good treat for someone that is looking for organic food.To be honest, I probably will not buy this anytime soon, but I definitely recommend it for someone that wants organic food."
3,"Purely boring, but good for you!","Pure Organic Wild Blueberry / Raw Fruit & Nut Bar. Nothing Cooked. Nothing processed. That's what the package says, and I was skeptical from the start. First, opening the package I noticed it had a funny smell (like off gassing), but it quickly went away. The look? Not all that appealing, really, but neither are PowerBars and Clif Bars. So moving onto the taste... it was just ""okay."" I wasn't wowed by it, but I didn't think it was bad, either. I felt satisfied, but I had to chase it down with some water.Honestly, I probably won't buy another one. The one I tasted was a free sample, but I would have probably bought one to try. I should note that I've eaten my share of energy bars in my days, and I've never found one that fit my criteria of being both healthy and tasting good; I either find one, but not the other. So the search continues..."
4,Wholesome Raw Snack Bar,"This date-nut-blueberry bar is tasty, really tasty. If you served it to someone, I think they'd be surprised to learn it is gluten-free, totally raw, vegan and organic. Most of the gluten-free snacks I've tried in the past have not come near the Pure bar in flavor. There's a nice balance between the nuts and dates, with a mild blueberry flavor.The bars are not very big, in fact, they are dwarfed by the packaging. If you are in search of a meal substitute, this might not be the best choice for you. I did eat mine at lunchtime and didn't get hungry again for several hours, I'd classify it as a heavier snack.Overall, I was impressed. The nuts and dates make it higher in fat and carbohydrates than I would have guessed, but with a list of ingredients I recognize and can pronounce, I am not too worried about it."
3,"An expensive, mediocre fruit & nut bar","Overall, the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit and Nut Bar was pretty good. It was a little dry in my opinion. It isn't very sweet almost more salty from the cashews. If you are looking for a not too sweet snack, you will probably enjoy it. It has a good flavor overall, but it was not outstanding in any way. It is a cherry outside with cashews intertwined throughout. Each bar has 190 calories and 8 grams of fat. It has 25g of carbs overall and contains several important nutrients. In my opinion, it was only slightly healthier than a candy bar. The draw is that it is certified organic. If you are looking for an organic snack, you could give this a try."
4,Fabulous,"This was a very good bar, chewy with nuts and cherry. It actually was filling and satisfying. I do not know how much they sell for, but they would go well on a trip to fill in-between craves. They certainly were better than granola bars."
3,Cherry Good,"I'm not usually a fan of power bars and the like. They strike me as fake food. The Pure Bare Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit and Nut Bar, however, is good -- and real. It's tart and tasty and surprisingly filling. You can see the bits of real nuts and the cherry taste is amazing. A mom recommended snack."
4,It reminds me of a gritty fig newton soaked in unsweetened grape juice,"The Pure bar I sampled was decent enough. It tastes like a fig newton (be it once of those flat organic ones, if you can imagine it) soaked in unsweetened grape juice until the bread is all soaked up, leaving a somewhat brown/puce color in its wake. It is made to be on-the-go, which doesn't work out so well, since it is a bit sticky. It is gritty but I wouldn't pass up one if it was offered to me by a friend, let's say on a hike, but buying them for myself is another story. I didn't get any cherry taste out of it at all, it tasted like grape to me. One star taken off for the combo of the owner having her drawing on the product (a little too egotistical for me) and the fact the product says it is cherry and doesn't taste like cherry at all."
3,Delicious and Filling,"This bar was delicious. If you are eating them to get protein, there are only 6 grams of protein in them which is not much bang for your buck. There are 26 grams of carbohydrates too so if you're aim is to control carbohydrates, that's a lot for one very small bar plus they are 200 calories which is high.I gave them 3 stars because for taste alone they were excellent. However, I prefer a bar that is larger, has less calories, less carbohydrates and more protein."
4,Pretty good!,"The ingredient list is very impressive - natural and simple. I wasn't sure how it was going to taste since it's labeled ""raw."" I was pleasantly surprised - it's mildly sweet and fruity (in a natural way of course). There is some minimal nutty texture from the real nuts. The only disappointment is that the bar itself is surprisingly small, which will be discovered once you open the package. Other than that, this bar can probably be recommended since it seems natural and healthful - good for any occasion maybe. Just don't expect it to really fill you up or sustain you for long!"
1,Dates with cherry flavor,"These are date bars with cherry flavor. The texture and taste are dominated by the dates, which comprise the base of this bar. I bought them to serve as a treat which I might reach for in lieu of chocolate, etc., or after dinner snack which would be nutritious. Since I don't like dates, these have not served my purpose. For my carbs and calories, I'd choose something else."
1,Delicious but bad shipping,I was very dissapointed witht he condition the bars came in. I opened the factory sealed box only to find 1 of 12 of the bars packaging was open and growing fungis. So i guess i paid for 11 bars instead of 12.. How does an open package bar get in a factory sealed box?
1,I couldn't even finish it,I am not going to argue the fact that these bars are 100% natural and a healthy alternative to snacking. However I am only willing to sacrifice so much to cut a few calories. To be totally honest these bars are the worst tasting snack that I have ever tried. They are so bad in fact that I could only finish about 1/2 of the bar. All I taste while eating them are dates with a hint of cashews and walnuts. I don't really taste the cherry in them at all. I have tried a few other similar bars that tasted much better than these. They are very small as well at about 1 1/2 inch by 3 1/2 inches and are quite expensive as well.
1,Tasteless,"This may be good for you, but it is like eating cardboard with a few nuts tossed in. One bite was too much."
1,High calorie count doesn't help taste,"My two favorite things, cherries and cashews! Unfortunately, I could have a candy bar instead of this 190 calorie bar. The smell is not enticing and the taste is flat. Not sweet, not salty.... just blah."
4,Very fruity and nutty,"The Pure Organic wild bluberry bar has a strong fresh blueberry flavor accompanied by a nutty flavor. The bar is very moist. The nutritional content is like many energy bars... 190 calories, 8 grams of fat, 26 grams of carbs, 6 grams of protein. The big difference in there is nothing but fruits, nuts and juice in this bar. No artificial flavors, fillers or preservatives. Pretty much guilt free."
2,Not enjoyable,"I was hoping for a good experience, but was dissapointed. The bar was very oily and had a lack of taste. I couldnt finish it."
2,DIdn't care for it,"The bar is quite small, although in it's defense it seems that all nutrition bars are getting progressively smaller. That's one way to get the calorie count down. Of course the high price remains the same.Flavor-wise it was below average for a nutrition bar. The cherry flavor bar (I also tried the blueberry) has a sort of jam flavor with a rather unpleasant undertaste of...I don't know what that undertaste was.I gave a bite to a friend and she said, ""That's nasty!""I would buy it if there was no other choice available. However, my first choice remains the Zone Bar."
3,More nutty than fruity,"The Organic Wild Blueberry Pure Bar is a filling snack that is a good source of both fiber and protein. As indicated by the name, all the ingredients are organic, and additionally, all the ingredients are also raw. The taste is mostly nutty, with the combination of walnuts, cashews, and almonds overpowering the blueberries quite a bit. I often find that snack bars, especially those with nuts, are difficult to chew, but this bar is fairly soft and easy to eat. I would eat this product again, but I do wish it tasted more like blueberries. I'd recommend it to nut-lovers."
4,Yum. Yum Yum Yum!,"I haven't indulged in this kind of food before, preferring candy to somewhat healthier foods. I'm pleased to say that it was worth the effort of stuffing it down my neck, as we say.I found the combination of flavors to suit my taste (but only four stars because some might not like it).The description of the ingredients is a little misleading. I wouldn't say that this tastes strongly of any of the major items.However, the resulting taste is delicious and I just wish Pure Bars had sent a pack of twelve rather than just one."
5,Simply delicious,This was a very nice organic bar. Not what I expected. Some of these can be gritty and make you feel like you're eating flavored sand. This wasn't like that. Great taste. Great texture. I'd order more for sure.
4,Pretty tasty and healthy treat!,"I've tried more than my share of protein/energy bars and most of them taste like sawdust. I was quite surprised when I took my first bite of Pure Organic (Cherry Cashew flavor) as it reflects its self-classification as a ""raw fruit & nut bar"") and goes down easily. This does not taste like all the rest and even has 7 grams of protein to boot. It does have 190 calories so for those of you who are watching your weight, it's important to know that this is not one of those diet bars, which in my opinion taste like junk because they are made from junk. I would highly this flavor in particular as it was refreshing. I also sampled the Wild Blueberry and did not like how it tasted."
4,Good air hose-not superb,An affordable air hose do the job right.Seems a little cheapo but works well.haven't use a lot but not issues at this time
1,Regrettable Misunderstandings about Attachment,"This new edition of Keck and Kupecky's book appears to repeat the many errors of the first one. Readers who compare this book's view of Reactive Attachment Disorder with that in DSM-IV-Tr will see that the list of problems discussed by Keck and Kupecky has almost nothing to do with the actual nature of RAD. A comparison of Keck and Kupecky's discussion of attachment with any of the many scholarly publications on this subject, such as those by Mary Ainsworth, Inge Bretherton, or Everett Waters, shows dramatic differences; whatever Keck and Kupecky are talking about, it is not what scholars and researchers mean by attachment.Readers should approach this book with serious caution, and check statements against other, more conventional sources before accepting them."
5,Great book with a lot of helpful information,"If you are a parent thinking about adoption. This is the book for you. This book takes you through all of the steps of adopting a hurt or non-hurt child. It takes a look at all aspects of adoption, your point of view and the child's point of view too. Parts of this book will help you understand what a hurt or non-hurt child feels when being adopted. This book mostly focusses on the hurt child, but it is still a good book to read for anyone thinking of adopting, because if you can adopt a hurt child, adopting a non-hurt child is a piece of cake. This is a must read."
3,Don't Read This One First,"I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting - and then spent a very sleepless night. I am an adoptive mother of 4 and my husband and I are currently in the process of an older child, domestic adoption. I really found the title to be misleading, because I kept looking for the HOPE in the book, but found more terror. I'm very glad I didn't read this book before adopting the 4 we have. I do think that reading the book helped me know what questions to ask during the case study review process and that it will help us know what we're getting into."
5,Everybody considering adoption should read this book!,"I wish I had read this book for my first adoption 3 years ago, now with my second adoption it is a life saver! Sure answered some questions and made us feel less anxious!"
2,Tremendous signal loss,"There are two electrical surfaces that much contact the cable. In the center is a metal pin, which pokes into the cable center. The outer wire sheet comes in contact with the screw. Bottom line is that so little metal comes in contact with the cable wires that there is tremendous signal loss. Volume loss is over 50%. I personally got about 30% signal, guesstimate. Not acceptable."
2,Disappointing,"What the hell happened to Anna? She was the perfect good girl wanting to go bad, then... I guess bad found her and took her as its own. She's lost my interest.Cammie is the best character. No questions asked. Everyone else pales in comparison to this lost little mean girl.I think that Cyn Baltres needs to make an appearance in the next one. She isn't mentioned much, but I think that she'd be perfectly placed in the next one.Hopefully the next one won't bore me as much."
1,Parents BEWARE! Lots of sexual content.,"These books are touted as ""teen"" books, but are highly sexual and completely inappropriate for young people. I read one just to keep up with what my 13-year-old stepdaughter is reading and could not believe that her mother allows her to read this trash. Passages where teens are kissing, then ""moaning"", then ""moving on top of her"" are common. This is adult material, not suitable for teens."
5,The Best One Yet!,"I have liked the A-list series from the moment they hit the shelves. Granted, they aren't the best books for teens you will find out there, but they are enjoyable and good, light reads.The first book was good, and the second was a little slow, but Blonde Ambition is probably the best in the series so far.In this book, Anna continues with an intership at Apex, Cammie gets a new stepsister, Sam's dad gets a guest role on the new series Hermosa Beach, and Dee looks for love.As compared to the other books in the series, in Blonde Ambition the characters are much more developed. You see a softer side of Cammie that was invisible in the other books. Anna, however, becomes a little less likeable. But the plot holds your intrest and makes you want to read on!Overall, this book was great. Certianly not a new classic, but great for teens who are fans of the Gossip Girl and A-list series! :)"
2,it was ok,"i was excited to read the third book of the a-list series cause the first two were so addicting. i thought this book was fun to read, even though i thought the story was stupid. ben turns into this over-possesive boyfriend, which totally comes out of nowhere, i think the author just wanted to get rid of his character. and i don't like how every guy that anna mets like, falls in love with her. shes kind of a hard character to relate to and in every book i like her less and less. i think cammie saved this book, and made it fun and sexy. its really annoying how everyone is turning toward anna and away from cammie, because she is the only interesting one. i hope in the fourth book, they keep more of cammie, and get more of anna's friend cynthia and bring back susan. ben will probably be back somehow but does anyone want to see him back??? and django will probably have a big part in the next one because his character keeps building up but hasn't gone anywhere with it."
3,pretty good...not the best in the series,"Beginning this book, I had really high expectations for it after finishing Girls on Film. And while Blonde Ambition wasn't a COMPLETE let down, I thought it was dissapointing. I loved how this book picked up exactly where the last left off, however as the story went on I found that there were characters that I had expected to be involved in the plot that simply weren't. Multiple times I was left wondering ""What was the point of that happening?"" and I found myself at times actually feeling VERY sorry and sympathetic towards Cammie, and not being able to relate at all to ANNA! All in all if you're a fan of this series, your up for a quick read, and you want to know what happens next in the story then I'd read this book. But don't have high expectations for it. Even though this story was not that good I still am excited to read the fourth in the series when it comes out, and really hope it is better then this one!"
4,Pretty Good One.,"I really like all of Zoey Dean's books and the could quite possibly be my favorite series that I have read so far. Some things in this book are unrealistic though like how Annna I blonde, tall, gorgeous, smart, and attracts pretty much all the guys. In this book, Blonde Ambition, I liked that we found a softer side of Cammie Shepard and a meaner side of Anna Cabot Percy. Obviously the book is filled with drama and love triangles so it is enjoyable and hard to put down. The only thing was that Ben Birnbaum,Anna's ex main squeese and ex object of affection, used to seem sweet, adorable but now just seems possessive and not as appealing and it just seems like Anna and him just keep breaking up and getting back together. Other than that this book was quite interesting.P.S.-I'm 13 years old"
3,"great concept and art, disappointing story.","okay, the sreies had so much potential. what the hell happened? it tried to be too much like the finale to cowboy bebop. this really made me feel taken for a ride. the whole series could've been compressed into one disc. save your money for something better. like the movie ""ishtar."""
5,super terrific,This book is a staple in the early childhood mental health field. It represents everything good in the promotion of social-emotional development in our society. Creating neurobiologically friendly environments for young children is a crossroad our society faces in an effort to have a positive impact on the mental health for our time. Implications for risk and resilience research contributions are included.
3,Mind-numbing,"""Neurons to Neighborhood"" has played a seminal role in increasing recognition among early childhood professionals and the general public of the critical role of neural development during the first years of life on subsequent life outcomes. In particular, it identifies childhood poverty as perhaps the major factor causing later cognitive and emotional deficits and disparities. That said, the book is ten years old and badly in need of a revision both to include important new research but to address a new audience. It is basically a public policy report and hence written in the mind-numbingly boring prose which seems de rigeur within the Beltway. Dr. Shonkoff's Center on the Developing Child has done an admirable job publishing short, accessible precis of many of the books findings. What is needed, in my opinion, is a shorter, more concise and more intellectually provocative work of ""popular science"" and social analysis."
4,"Tremendous first outing. Too familiar, though.",There is little need to read this if you are up on your James M. Cain or Jim Thompson. The only difference is Harrington offers up lots of sex and some violence to update the genre AND he does an admirable job of preventing the familiar from getting overly trite. I will say that this is an impressive debut work. I hope Harrington finds his own plots and his own voice.
5,"Good ""how to book"" on realistic charcoal figure drawing.","I liked this book. It is well laid out and easy to follow his steps. The author make a very difficult task look easy. (It is not easy, trust me) Charcoal is my medium of choice and there are so few books on this specific subject. I wish this book showed more expressive approaches. A free more abstract approach with the figure playing hide & seek is more to my liking. I especially liked the price"
4,"Good product, Good value","Ordered this garment for our daughter in preparation for our Detroit Lions themed super bowl party. It looks sharp, is well made, and would have cost $10-15 more if you bought it anywhere else.FYI - The medium size does run a little bigger especially in the sleeves, but I guess it is always better for something to be a little too big than a little too small.Most importantly, my daughter likes it."
5,more doubles would be better,2 of the very early originals; I wondered how people were in the 1920s.The structure of a double back-to-back book in unconventional but intriguing.I wish there more Hardy boox like this one (or double I should say).
5,English lesson,it's for my wife to improve her English. I remember this from the Mickey Mouse club so reading the story brings back memories for me too. The vocabulary is just at the right level with just enough new words for her to learn.
2,book smelled terrible,"If this review is over the contents of the book, then the book is excellent. I have actually enjoyed reading a text book! If the review is the purchase of the book, the previous owner smoked and smoked a lot! Every time I opened book I got a reaction. I cannot be in a room with smoke so I get very congested and hate using the book."
1,very particular style,i started reading this and immediately thought of Celine. there are many pages of straight dialogue with some minimal descriptive sentences. you'll either love the technique and style or not and you really need to dip into it yourself before buying. personally i just didn't care about the characters or have an interest in the events.
5,Another classic by America's premier writer,"If you've ever read ""The Recognitions,"" then I'm pretty sure that you're sure that Gaddis is brilliant, and if anything worthy of being read as he is one of the preminent American scribes of our century. Like Pynchon, Gaddis takes long journeys that are wicked and iconoclastic. Both set their teeth into the American mindset with very hardhitting insight and verve. But they are American, so I really doubt the reader who shelled out the pounds could have ever been into it in the first place. After all, what do people who eat loony cows and whose judges wear wigs know about late 20th century Americana in the first place? This book is excellent"
2,Why don't I Iike any of these people?,"Although tour-de-force writing, this book is a difficult read. Inadequate puncuation, run on sentences, lengthly full-text LEGAL BRIEFS and massive excerpts from one character's ponderous Civil War play make for an overall annoying literary experience. Although there are many humorous moments of exchange between the main characters (you have to figure out who's talking by context since the author rarely identifies the speaker), most of the personalities end up being stunningly whiney and have almost zero redeeming values, which makes you say at the end: ""Do I care about any of these people? NO."""
3,"Cruel humor, too hard to read","This is a comedy? Just a cast of very few people talking to one another, not allowing anyone to finish a sentence, never having anyone finish a sentence without changing the subject, all done without quotation marks. It's hard to read and that's not necessary. Oscar is a bit mad. He and Christine are accomplished enough, and he is a classicist, but he left common sense in the pile of his unopened mail and his unpaid bills. He let his car run over himself and it's a problem whether his insurance should pay him as owner or victim. Is he suing himself? Hilarious? The ridiculous judicial opinions are funny -- indeed they make the book worth reading. And by the way, they're easier to read than the dialog."
1,Yuck! This book stank!!,"I'm afraid I didn't get past the first 50 or so pages because this book stank. It was billed as a hysterical comedy of manners in America in the 1990's etc., etc., but was about as funny as a good kick up the arse. The subject is some asinine litigation, which gives the author an excuse to pad out the text with the most tedious legal verbiage and opinions. It was bad! 7.99 as well"
1,Kill me now and save me from this!,"What can I say? Intense, jumbled, over-bearing - yawn. This novel is about as exciting, and readable, as the telephone directory. So Gaddes knows how to use words - big deal. Can he write a story? No. Save your cash - buy a book by Philip Roth instead if you feel the need to impress."
3,phew! I need a vacation!,"I forced myself to finish this book. Several areas of alliteration were fascinating & masterful. Funny, yes, but it was like walking through three feet of mud in high heels. This is not a book for those expecting short-term reward, but wickedly satirical on many levels. Will I read Gaddis again?-hmmmmmmmmm maybe I'll just stick pins in my eyes......"
4,guide to reading gaddis,"just to burden you with my opinion and to disagree with joshua below (done with trepidation given his impressive reading list)--this is a pretty damn fine book. for a committed gaddis-ite, 'jr' or 'the recognitions' may have been better, but i'm not sure that isn't because they're less accessible and we gaddis-ites like to shun accessibility. for the non gaddis-ite, 'a frolic of his own' should stand alone as a fine piece of work that rewards patience easily. u-who-have-not-read-this-book-yet: persevere. unlike the other gaddis books, u will get used to his style more quickly here. do not read in short bursts because you will have to relearn to read gaddis each time; read in long stretches, you learn to recognize the voices and don't need to search for who's talking (the non-verbal bits even become a little irritating). if it doesn't work out after 20-30 pages, put it aside for a year or two and come back to it (maybe after reading joyce). good luck."
3,Too many questions,"I felt this book was somewhat redundant about questions dealing with parental/grandparental advice. Maybe I'm older than the group this book is aimed at, but at my age (73), there were too many specific questions about my feelings, too much space for recipes. A lot of the extra pages I used for additional photos. I preferred Grandmother A Record Book of Memories by Linda Spivey for its variety."
4,Excellent reads,"I have always been interested in ""Biblical fiction/religous fiction, since the days that ""The Robe"" and ""The Silver Chalice"" were required reading in my high school Latin class. The first two books in this series, and I hope there are more, are very well crafted stories. I for one do not have a problem with the author's detailed footnotes. The characters are richly drawn andthe reader will surely want to know what happens to them. I have only one minor critique.... I always thought that Pontius Pilate's wife's name was Claudia, not Fortunata, or have I seen too many cinematic religious epics(Particularly Vivica Lindfor's performance in King of kings.)"
5,Absolutely amazing!,"Lund made me feel as though I were right there in the Holy Land during the time of Christ. His insight into the customs and situations of the time allowed me to better understand the nuances of the New Testament. For example, I now understand why the ""walk the extra mile"" lesson was so difficult to the Jews at the time."
3,Thank you,I want to thank the writer for writing a book that puts a lot of things into perspective. So many times we read the Bible and yet not have a real connection to those places or times. Writing a fictional story which have characters explain a lot of it has been extremely helpful.I do have one major criticism however; and it is what has prompted the 3 star down from a 4 star review. There simply were no blue eyed blonde hair people in the Middle East at this time. It is amazing to me that someone with Lund's knowledge would actually provide physical character traits that were so off from reality. It is a reminder of how Euro/Anglo American centered that view is. It is an error that I just don't consider minor. Done in ignorance I'm sure and one that should be examined by the author.
5,Fantastic!,David McCullough wrote what is considered to be the best book on the Panama Canal and narrates this Nova episode. We transited the canal and they showed this DVD on the ship because it is such a complete look at the canal and its history. The only drawback is that it is over 10 years old but no one has made a better one or one with a more comprehensive view of the canal and its history.
5,Building of Panama Canal,"Understanding how the Panama Canal was built. who started the building, the workers who help built the canal, the sacrifice that these people has to endure, who was responsible in finishing the momumnetal task and to what is the Panama Canal today is a marvelous historical representation.I thank you."
2,"One worked, the other did NOT","The first inkjet cartridge that I put in the printer did not print properly. The second one did, but this was a waste of money and resources. Also, the inkjet cartridges did not come in a cardboard package as pictured, nor did they have return envelopes for the used cartridges, another waste."
3,"Arrived Promptly, Not Packaged Properly","I ordered two ink cartridges. One was packaged in the proper hp box but the other was in a small bag. Appeared strange and as if it had been tampered with, but it seems to be working fine."
2,bait and switch,"If something appears too good to be true, BEWARE, it probably is!! The picture on the product page shows the ink cartridge to be an original HP cartridge. There's nothing on the page to make you think otherwise, except the price. Well, I paid my $7 and sure enough, although I received it in a timely manner, it was not an HP product. It was a refurbished cartridge from another company. I won't be buying from this vendor again."
2,T,Simply too expensive and does not last that long. I went to the extent to buy another printer with cheaper ink cartridges.
3,me gusta,el producto es muy bueno de verdad los recomiendo a todas aquellas personas que se atrevan y compren son muy responsables .muchas graciassaludos
3,Good for limbering,"About a 45-minute tape, half of it some basic moves for belly dancing, the other half basic moves for Tai chi. She never really puts it all together for you, though she does do a demonstration of each. Good, easy exercises for limbering."
1,Don't waste your money,"For anyone who has the slightest knowledge of Belly Dance, this video will be a severe waste of money. I started dancing MANY years ago but bought this video on the assumption that it combined the two art forms. I do not know who told the hostesse of the video that she could dance but wow.....bad bad bad dancer!!!!! Her form is very sloppy, very amaturish. This may be okey for someone who has No knowledge of this dance, but if you KNOW Middle Eastern dance, you will be appalled at this extremely poor dance exhibition. TWO THUMBS DOWN. A stinker."
1,lamp problems,"I have been through 2 of these sets in 6 months.. the ""lamp"" keeps burning out. The entire unit was replaced by the retailer the first time (it lasted 3 months) The second unit has just went out(it lasted 3 months). How may times during The life of this tv will i have to have the repairman replace the lamp?? Thankfully i bought a extended service plan If you buy this tv make sure you do the same.."
2,lamp problems,"Lamp/fan unit on 52z585 broke after only 4 months. They (Brandsmart) service says i get 2 free replacements then I'm on my own. Buyer beware. Good picture but feeling nervous about long term reliability. Don't buy this TV. Next time, I'll buy a Sony."
2,Not great for beginner,"This book has a lot of great examples of illustration, but the layout of the book is way too confusing. I found myself often lost where I should continue to read. The intro for interface has very little help for the beginner to start this program. This book might be good reference for advanced users, but not for beginners. Maybe the author wants to make a nice-looking book, but this book is over-designed, lack of functionality . I would recommend video tutorial from Lynda.com, it's ideal for beginners who never used Corel Painter and Wacom drawing tablets."
4,Covers every aspect of painter,"This book does not focus on just one aspect of painter, such as painting photographs or raw illustration. It goes through each different use of painter in good detail.This is a strength of the book, but a weakness as well since I was looking more for painting photographs. It is well written and ""technical enough.""A CD is included."
4,Painte 9 WOW,"This is a beautiful book.I am learning this software by myself and with this book I can go further to learn it.....It is easy to follow.Some of the projects are a little bit hard to understand,so go back later when you know more.....I am new at this kind of stuff and it help me.I can say after reading a few pages what kind of work I will like to do. Try it and you will love it.It will keep you busy for a while"
4,Great reputation in graphic art world,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for both of my adult children who do a lot of graphic art and photo restoration. It was highly recommended by other artists. It is too early to comment on the quality or usefulness of the books but they arrived quickly and in great, new condition. This book, in flipping through it, looks very interesting."
4,CHOCK FULL OF INFO,This is an excellent book for PAINTER IX users. There are lots of inspiring paintings from many artists and generally good explanations of the processes used to create them. It does a great job of giving insight into PAINTER's extensive capabilities.My only negative comment would be that the book tries to cover too much. It's scope is overwhelming. I don't believe it would suit the novice PAINTER user.
1,worlds worst knife fighting guidebook!,"One would expect much more from Rex Applegate...the main plot of the book revolves around how Applegate made a new knife that improved upon the Fairbairn-Sykes knife of World War Two fame; Applegate spends most of the book trying to sell his design, the Applegate-Faibairn combat dagger. The book gives a bit of knife fighting history and a few basic do's and dont's.....my advice, don't......."
1,This book is actually more of a pamphlet.,"This small booklet provides a very brief glimpse in to a variety of related topics. There is almost no information whatsoever on techgniques or training. This book would only be of value to someone who barely knew what a knife was, let alone how to hold one."
3,A good basic guide to using the knife for combat.,"Sometimes good things come in small packages. This book (actually a booklet)is only 40 pages but it has some valuable basic information for anyone interested in knife combat. It is not a comprehensive text and does not show how to perform the thrusts and slash techniques. It does cover the basic stance, basic knife grips, history of the Applegate-Fairbairn knife and vulnerable areas of the body. In conclusion, this book was written by the late Col. Rex Applegate, which makes it a little bit of a collectors item.Rating: 3 stars. Joseph J. Truncale(Author: Tanto-Jutsu Official Manual of Bushi Satori Ryu)"
1,Este libro apesta,El libro no trae nada de informacion importante es una perdida de papel. Y como si fuera poco tiene algunas paginas en blando en el medio.
2,"Words Horrified me, but information was relevant","I felt the words were too vicious in description for me. I am a knife thrower, but a hobbyiest and I found this written like a hunter killing a deer."
2,Ronald Reagan Tear Down This Preamp!,"This preamp is real ugly. This is the ""I'm Broke"" Look, but it will look oh so great in my downcast trailer system."
1,Not theologically sound,"Although there is a disclaimer on the title page, this book takes too many liberties. The book ends with God telling the rose ""Because of the love you have shown for the baby dove, I will call My Son the Rose of Sharon for He too will give everything He has and show the world my love.""Jesus is God! How can we even think that the Creator of all things would be named after creation! I chose not to read the book to my children. Purchase the Jesus Storybook instead, as it presents a beautiful picture of the Savior."
3,"BETTER ""LIVE"" RECORDINGS ELSEWHERE","I am not a big fan of the post Electric Ladyland era Hendrix. Most of the material coming out after Electric Ladyland just seemed to be marking time while Hendrix was transitioning into something else he hadn't fully decided on. So while this CD is good, it seems to me it is not as good as other ""live"" material already released.I would recommend any one of these CD's instead:1.) Blue Wild Angel: Jimi Hendrix Live At The Isle Of Wight2.) Live At Woodstock3.) Live At Winterland or4.) Stages (if you can find it)"
2,"Poor LP, great music","The music is excellent. No question about it. However, the imbecile responsible for cutting the LP version of the album should be subjected to a class action lawsuit because it's the WORST record I have ever come across. The grooves are not centered and thus not circular, forcing the tone arm to slide back and forth, and therefore the needle against one wall of the groove and then the other. DO NO BUY THIS LP. It was poorly manufactured. Buy the CD instead."
4,Jimi Hendrix - 'Live At Berkeley' (Experience Hendrix),"Lavishly packaged archive performance CD release.Twelve track disc of a gig that was recorded on May 30,1970 during the 2nd gig,the 10pm show.Nicely done cover - actual flyer of the concert itself.Since I've never had ANY Hendrix bootlegs before anyway,I honestly believe that I was even MORE so thrilled to snatch a copy of this legit pressing.As always,the line-up is a trio,on 'Live At Berkeley',we have Jimi-guitar&vocals,Billy Cox-bass and Mitch Mitchell-drums.The setlist is good,with several memorable of Hendrix's anthems,FM staples;call 'em what you will.I was most impressed with ""Hey Baby(New Rising Sun)"",""Stone Free"",a tune that he didn't write,but made it a 'head music' classic ""Hey Joe"",""Foxey Lady"",""Purple Haze"" and ""Voodoo Child(Slight Return)"".Comes with a superb 24-page full color booklet,sort of like a mini-program.Recommended."
4,great but could be better,i love henxdrix and when i got this cd i thought some of the songs were great track 3 especially but i think he just didnt play as well as the second part of this concert... if i were you id buy the hendrix playing the blues or the first part of the concert if you could find it
2,Hendrix 1970-Berkley,"Many ""critics"" and fellow musicians alike have/had counted Jimi out by 1970, however, you can hear the intensity in which he plays with on tracks like Johnnie B. Goode and Hey Joe, the later of which may be the best, most tonal version available. You can hear police radios bleeding into the feed-back. If you a ""true"" fan of Jimi, you will already have this music in one form or fashion, if your are curious, it is well worth owning it. It's truly awesome how 37 years after Jimi's untimely death, his hold on generations of fans continues to expand. It is extremely likely that 100 years from now, they will still be listening to Jimi! Buy it, you will NOT regret it!"
1,Sloppy & Stoned,"Hendrix's live albums never come anywhere near the perfection of the studio albums. Not just because he was wasted, though that appears to be why this music is just sloppy."
2,not good,"Seems like the person who wrote this manual got all of their knowlage from the ""PC's for dummies"" books....very slow, made simple computing task appear much too complicated...."
1,Won't work with NT,"This might be a great printer, but it doesn't work with Windows NT. If Lexmark had said this upfront, it would have saved me a lot of time, trouble, and shipping costs."
5,Absolutely terrific,"I bought a Lexmark printer three years ago and because I was so pleased with their product support people (very short waits on phone, competent, courteous people) I only thought of Lexmark when it was time to get a new printer. Installation is a snap and the X1100 does everything well, including photos. A great bargain too. Terrific."
2,Good quality for the money...when it works,"I purchased this in the store on clearance and new. 95% of the time while printing color, the cartridge ""stalled"". I would have to open up the printer, take out and put back the cartridges, and start it back up. 50% of the time, Windows XP would lock up. I had all the drivers and patches installed from the Lexmark website, but it would not work. After a while, BW printouts started ""stalling"". So much wasted time and paper. I think that the cartridge holders were too flimsy and they would fall out of place during violent printing. My whole printer stand trembled while printing. Lexmark support never sent new cartridges, so I took it back."
1,"Old printer, CD does not install drivers -","I went with what was supposedly a printer that came with everything. I have tried to install on 2 different computers, I continue to get the error message about settings and drivers not installed properly. Waste of my money since i have not printed one page.Should have been honest on age (ink says bought 8/23/080 of printer. Boxed poorly had peanuts coming out 3 sides."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"I am so fustrated! I got it this past christmas, and it was ggrreeaaattt! Then just today I was having so much problems with the paper being crooked or it would jam, so I called the company and they told me it would need to be replaced, well I guess the printer was sitting at the K-Mart where I got from for a llloooonnnnggg time cause the warranty was issued in July of 2003!!!!! So before I even got it, the damn warrenty was already expired!! So now all I'm left with is a really bulky scanner (hey at least that works, thats what I mainly use this for.)SO DO NOT GET THIS PRINTER UNLESS YOU WANT TO BLOW $80 ON A FAULTY PRINTER!!"
4,Great value for the money,"I have had this printer now for six months and I am delighted with it. I am studying textile & surface design and have used the printer to scan my designs and alter them on both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I have to say though that scanned color images do not exactly come out true to color, but what would you expect for such a price?The copy function allows me to make single copies of documents in a cinch, and the fax function has worked well too, although you can only scan one page at a time manually.I never had any software problems on my Sony laptop either.In short, this is highly recommendable for the home user."
5,can't go wrong,This 3-tier shelf is high; it needs to be to serve its purpose: stack different types of dinnerware on each level. The product is of very sturdy quality; definitely would last for generations. Gone are those frustrated days of lifting top bowls and plates just to get to the one you want.
1,Where is the 3-D?,"I agree with the other reviewers. I could hardly see any 3-D effect. I read the instructions carefully and followed every step, but still I don't get the point - wearing the glasses only makes the images harder to see, not to mention any stunning 3-D effects. I'm so disappointed and will try to return it."
1,I'm returning this immediately!,My 5 year old received this toy for christmas and we just tried it for the first time. I immediately came on here to write A review (which i've never done) because I don't want anyone else wasting their money. The 3d effects are horrible and wearing the glasses actually makes the images harder to see. We ended up finishing the slides without them and just watching the blurry pictures. Don't buy this...it's a waste of time and money.
1,BAD,"First of all-be warned, NOT the Disney version for kids. Dark, violent, typical Japanese amination, and a wandering storyline that ultimately had me up and--of all things--vacuuming halfway through it. I kept trying to return, but each time I reached the same conclusion--BAD. Bad, bad, bad."
1,"TERRIBLE movie! This is not the ""MULAN"" movie from Disney!","Despite the fact that the soundtrack of this movie is in DTS, nothing is GOOD to say about this movie. The animation is so primitive that none of my three kids (ages 2, 7, and 10) likes it. It was my mistake to buy this movie since I thought this was the wonderful ""MULAN"" movie from Disney."
3,"The Xcelite Hs18 - 9/16"" X3 1/8"" Full Hollow Shaft Nutdriver","The Xcelite Hs18 - 9/16"" X3 1/8"" Full Hollow Shaft Nutdriver, Orange Handle was a very good prodcut once it reached my house. However, there was a problem that developed when the shaft driver was being sent to my house. First it was sent to the wrong place and then in order to get it to the correct address additional contact was needed. It was then sent using next day delivery and the product has been fine ever since."
2,slow moving but Bogart carries the film,this is really just a remake of GASLIGHT with sidney greenstreet driving rich man Bogart into confessing his crime of murder. slow moving by today's standard. Bogart argued with Jack Warner for release from making this film but was threaten with suspension. The flim never sparkles with life.
2,Very minor league film noir,"This 1945 offering has Bogey knocking off his wife because he prefers her sister, commiting (he thinks) the perfect crime but.... Mundane dialogue, occasional excursions into soap opera, and bits of dime-store psychology all weigh this opus down. Bogart does the best he can with what he has to work with. This was released after Double Indemnity and near the same time as Murder, My Sweet and Woman in the Window but it is not in the same league with any of them."
4,CONFLICT,"THIS FILM WITH BOGART,SMITH,AND GREENSTREET, HOW COULD YOU GO WRONG?VERY GOOD MYSTERY, SUSPENSE AND FILM NOIR. THE ACTING IS GREAT AND CHARLESDRAKE JUST STARTING HIS FILM CAREER IS GOOD.DAVE"
5,Awesome Chai,"For those of you out there who really loved the old Borders Cafe Vanilla Chai, this is a perfect substitute. I'm not a big spiced chai fan and unfortunately this is what most coffee places serve (Starbucks, etc). I love this vanilla chai. I am still looking for a good alternative for the old Borders Decaf Chai, but for now this caffeinated version is perfect."
2,A little too mature for young children,"This seemed like a cute simple book for a pre-schooler, the story of 2 dogs at the park. The pictures of thier activities were fun until we got to the picture of the dogs mating. If you are not ready to explain the birds and the bees to a 4 year old, skip this book"
3,Very interesting to children...,"I recieved this book from my parents for my 9th birthday, I am 19 now. Back then I didn't understand what this little book was suggesting, until now. It's basically about a male and a female dog who wonder around town, find each other, fall in love, then have puppies. But one thing no one mentions is that they also hump in the book. There is a full color picture/drawing of the two dogs going at it!! I find it halarious now, its like doggy-pornography!! For little kids, no less!! AUGH!! THE OUTRAGE!!"
3,Results,"Having heard them in concert in Richmond VA at the Folklife Festival made me want to own one of their CDs, since none were available for purchase atthe event. This one captures the balladic nature of their music and I am quite satisfied."
3,The suspense builds a real showdown of wits and strength !,"Starring Patrick Campion and David C.FrazierA Ray & Migdalia Etheridge Production.Think CON AIR on foot,LOL !...Another thought is a mockbuster of `Midnight Run'.This micro-budget crime thriller takes place in FLORIDA and the tourism bureau owes them some coin !Really has a nice plot and `Etheridge Go-To-Thespian' Campion delivers another cutting edge creep.Overall the acting was real and not forced,Some truly developed characters and script had no flaws to speak of.The stand out acting is by Frazier(As Chain Gang Guard),He really should be added to all future Florida cinema."
1,Avoid,"This is not the real thing. This was a production by English National opera with opera voices not show voices. It doesn't even begin to sound right. For an ignored work, the ENO production appeared oddly soon after the excellent provincial production at Wythenshawe Forum in south Manchester, UK. Were ENO influenced in their choice by the Manchester show? It seemed so at the time and the ENO production was a very pale evening by comparison. This CD shows why! Avoid. The Original Broadway cast recording is the best going, though it's not at all perfect. Why is this excellent work, full of terrific music and visuals, so ignored?? Too expensive to stage?"
5,Loved the show!,"We have become one of those, watch the whole series all at once type of couples. This show gives Kelsey Grammer new areas to explore."
3,Kelsey is great,"Kelsey Grammar does an outstanding job in this series, but the subject matter just left me kind of flat.I couldn't really care about the characters. I understand why it was not renewed for more seasons."
2,Meh,This show is not really interesting to me. There is nothing that stands out among the rest of the multitude do crime dramas.
5,It took 3,"It took three episodes for me to get me really into Boss but then... Unstoppable! If there is any truth in the heights of scandal depicted, we should all be afraid!!"
4,Boss season 1,"Excellent show if you like plot building and some wicked twists. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but just remember no one is safe in this series!"
3,Boss,"The show is okay, I have watched a few episodes. Maybe it's just me, with all the campaigning in real life, I just don't want any more politics. Especially, for entertainment."
2,Not that great,"Kelsey grammar I just can't take him seriously as a hard ass, the story just didn't work with me it seemed like it was over played and bad scripting"
1,kelsey grammers plays bad dude,"This show to me was so horrific I threw it in the garbage. The story is well done, fast paced. The acting was well done . I'm ly devoid of sorry kelsey I just hate to see you in this light. The characters are without moral;s or compassion. I felt like I had let evil into my home. I like the ganster, mobster, other side of life stories but this one went way and above anything I could sit through a second time. recommend it. NO don't even watch it to satisfy your curiosity"
1,BOSS : SEASON 1,"THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING THING I HAVE SEEN LATELY. I AM SO ASHAMED OF KELSEY GRAMMER. THERE IS NO NEED FOR THE LANGUAGE IN THIS SHOW. I HAVE THROWN IT AWAY AND WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE LIKE IT, IF I CAN HELP. I HAD NOT SEEN THE SHOW AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT KELSEY WOULD STOOP TO THIS KIND OF ACTING. IN THE PAST, I ENJOYED HIS SHOWS. NOW I HAVE A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK ON HIS ABILITIES. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS SHOW. I DID NOT WANT TO GIVE IT ANY STARS, THE REVIEW MADE IT HAVE ONE."
3,Interesting...But Not Really My Kind Of Show.,"Note: I saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.The first episode of this series is interesting. It tries to ba a little bit of the classic film ""Citizen Kane"" starring Orson Welles with today's problems, and it works. but modern political corruption...not my style of show. I prefer The Borgias, which is a historical drama."
2,"Better without the ""Porn""",The series would be much more compelling without all of the hardcore porn scenes. It is easy to see what parallels from real news events the author chose to focused on. Too bad..The rest of the acting is superb. You can guess the (Possible) endings from watching the first four segments of the series. If it catches on or if it doesn't. The first four episodes was more sex than I wanted to view. I don't rent porn movies either.
5,Awesome show!,"This show has everything...politics, power, corruption, drama, suspense, EVERYTHING! Wish it would have been continued for more than two seasons!"
5,Kelsey is wonderfully EVIL,"What a pleasant surprise to find this show. I did not know what to expect when I bought this, but took a shot-----Glad I did. The acting is excellent and the plot is not what I expected. It's nice to find a show that you can't predict! Item was in excellent condition and arrived quickly, thanks."
5,"Worth it, everyone should watch it!!","Got hooked on this show, and love every episode. Kelsey Grammar is great and a mean sob. Worth every penny, ready to catch up on season 2"
3,Great acting by Kelsey Grammar!,Well done series although the plot goes over the top regarding the main characters' criminal activities. Looking forward to Season 2.
4,"Political drama, cut throat, back stabbing and such... as good as it gets.","Great direction, character development, casting, cinematography of Chicago. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Kelsy was born for this part."
3,"wonderful, but for specialists only","I like the Lomax disks, I like real folk, country, and bluegrass music, and I usually like less polished music by early, uncommercial artists. Nevertheless, I don't listen to this disk much. The problem isn't the quality of the music, which is high. But it's not just less polished, it's totally unpolished. I think you really have to be searching for the roots of just this type of music to appreciate this disk."
2,UMMMM,NOT A BAD CD BUT NOT THE BEST. HER VOCALS DON'T COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL SINGER JANET'S VOICE. THE LINE UP WITH ONE ORIGINAL MEMBER IS AS SAD AS TRACII GUNS LA GUNS
1,Worst mixed album of the Decade!,"If you liked the original Vixen then save yourself the agravation and don't buy this disc. Live & Learn has some of the same tracks and is much better, at least you can hear the band on it!"
5,Unexpected but lovely.,"I own all Hawksely's CD's and bought this one the first day it come out.This one surprised me in how mainstream friendly it was in comparison to the others, but it is still pure Hawksely. Joyful even in it's sorrow, beautiful in it's fighting spirit.We will always need songs like these. Buy it, keep an open mind and love it forever.Oh yeah, if you don't have Almost a Full Moon find it and buy it before Christmas comes!"
4,Not Your Average CD,"This CD is great because it's so different than pretty much anything else out there. I discovered Hawksley Workman on Pandora radio- he's still virtually unknown in the US. It took me a couple times listening to his music, but if you're looking for something different, it will grow on you. I like that he doesn't take himself so seriously and isn't afraid to go out on a limb. Best tracks (to me) are: ""We Will Still Need a Song"" (love this one), ""Wonderful and Sad"", ""Anger as Beauty"" and ""Autumn's Here"", a song that's kind of sad and conjures up images of leafless trees and grey, short days. Hawksley's not for everyone, but give him a shot. You may just discover you like his style."
3,not the greatest,"This album isn't completely bad. The released songs are catchy but the sound to the rest of the album is kind of repetetive. I don't find the lyrics to be overly good and the instrumental part of the album isn't very original. I do however love ""anger as beauty"". Not one of my favorite albums but not complete junk either."
4,"A Poetic Genius-wonderful/sad, anger/beauty","My friend had told me about Hawksley Workman, when he saw him open for Sloan. He sent me ""romantize the automobile"", an absolutely poetic track, its obvious Workman has a fetish with ""transportation"" you will hear references to the ""automobile"", ""motorcycle"" among others. The guitar/drum parts used are most appropriate and thoughtfully used. His lyrics are sincere (but, not sweetly sincere, but sincere), one does not know if his songs reflect his own personal experiences or a portion of his imagination. Workman's voice is incredible -not overly done, but natural, sincere & warm, his voice reflects his deep, sometimes sad (realistic) lyrics. He uses many juxtapositions, metaphors like most incredible writers, Workman has references to changes in seasons (this reminds me of John Mayer). The bonus tracks are amazing! Buy the album for those 2 bonus tracks at least..""Wonder/Sad"", ""Anger/Beauty"" this is HAWKSLEY WORKMAN."
3,light coverage,"I bought the Hydrator with SPF after having a great experience with the PCA Silkcoat Balm. I thought the Hydrator would be a similar texture to the Silkcoat balm - only with the SPF. The Hydrator has a much thinner consistency & does not hydrate my skin as I would like. I gave this product three stars because of the SPF..for dry skin, try the Silkcoat Balm - it's awesome!"
4,Great Read for the Summer Beach Bag,"The setting, Wilmington, Delaware, used to be my home, so I'm always scouting for books about Wilmington to stave off my homesickness for a ""great place to be somebody."" What fun to meet Holly Hannah and discover the twists and turns her life takes over a year. Great character development, a realistic lifestyle and the attention to detail was fun. This is a good book to take to the beach. It is a quicker read than the size and page numbers hint as the print is large and very easy to read without my middle-aged cheaters. Enjoy and I'm looking forward to Holly's next adventure."
3,more space boy dreams,"this album sounds like a collection of 10 belle and sebastian b-sides. in other words, it's pretty cool."
4,Barking up the right tree.,"Belle and Sebastian bassist Stuart David has finally released his first full length solo album after releasing a handful of singles through Sub Pop's seven inch Singles Club. With the help of his wife and brother, David put together a collection of home recordings that range from amazing to zany. Most of the album's recordings feature loud synthesizer with dialog, passages from Charles Bukowski novels and David's own narratives spoken over the top with his thick Scottish accent. Some songs, such as the opening track, ""Treehouse,"" features David's young son singing in the back ground. The best song, by far, is the self-titled track ""Looper."" It mixes prerecorded noises, synthesized voices and a plethora of instruments. Although Up a Tree is fun to listen to, it doesn't bare any relation to David's Belle and Sebastian work. His innovations are interesting and have made creative use of his home recording resources"
3,SO CUTE! (3 and 1/2 stars actually...),"The album is in a word, adorable. In everyway, from the first track that is a loop of little kids talking about a treehouse, to the story of how Looper came to be (Stuart and KARN writing letters for seven years, THEN they hold hands for the first time) to the sequal of the first track with more little kids. One downside could be seen as the fact that they use the same loop many times through the same album. The first track is an introduction of things to come, because the little tune goes throughout the album. But it works very well, and really sets a theme for the album, being the treehouse. This album deserves no credit for being one of the best albums ever to come out, it's not any proof of Stuart Davids musical talent. It is just cute. There is nothing wrong with that, becuase it is VERY cute. Good music to put a smile on your face. Perfect for the sentimental at heart."
4,Electronic funland,"This is a cool, cool album. You can almost hear the smile(s) on the musician(s)'s faces(s) (not sure if it's just Stuart, or if there are more of them) in each beautifully odd bit of music. There's a funny, friendly cheekiness and oddness about this album (and the Belle and Sebastian albums) that could only come from the UK. I've had it for about a week now, and I can't stop listening."
4,"fun, happy and clever.......music you can relax too","looper have made an album that is fun to listen to, easy to enjoy, and able to make you think too. it`s not totally original or particularly moving, but instead of messing you up, it calms you down/"
2,Wow it is tiny,This Porti-potty is very small and cheap. I would suggest spending a few dollars more for a larger one. Also it is better to buy one with a snorkle for ease of dumping.
5,Small but just right,"I've only used this for one weekend in my camper, but it was perfect. It's small enough to fit into the space I have, plus it flushed well and was easy to empty and clean."
4,novice user,"I love this item. I have given it to several people for gifts. I keep one in my purse, nail kit, and at work. It is the only file I use. I would have given it 5 stars except if you drop it 1 time it is trash. The file is very fragile."
4,Read about them on Amazon,I had never tried a crystal nail file until I read about it on Amazon. I was looking for the old fine diamond dust metal ones that I've used for 40 years.....but they are not to be found. This is a close second to those. My only reservation is that this one IS glass and you have to be careful not to drop. It is also thicker than the metal ones and so not quite so easy to handle. Soooo much better than the paper based emery boards which wear out after one or two uses.
4,Nice Product,"This is definatley better than using, an emery board, but my OPI Nail file I previously ordered from Amazon, is the best, it's finer, you get better results."
4,Great for learning shapes and taking turns!!,"My 2 1/2 and 4 year olds love this game. They acually take turns and I have peace and quiet for about 20 minutes! There are 2 ways to play. One way for beginners that are learning their shapes and the other way for kids who already know their shapes. Very cute, and incredibly strong plastic!"
4,Educational and Fun,"I purchased this game when my twins were two years old. That was a year ago. At age two, they learned a few shapes. Now they know more shapes. I find this game to be very educational and fun for the kids. At first the parent should sit with their child to teach them. As they get older, they learn to play on their own.It's a good buy for the price. And kids will enjoy it."
5,Price problem,"I first found this game 5 years ago and always give it as a toddler gift. It is one of the greatest toys to grow with your child because you can make up so many games with it. However, this current listing is OUTRAGEOUSLY PRICED! I have never paid more than [...] for this toy. Please tell me this [...] price is a terrible typo! Buyer BEWARE!"
3,Poor Abridgment of a Good Story,"Listening to this abridged audio has motivated me to want to read the book.Although I did enjoy listening to Stahl read the book herself (you could actually ""hear"" her smile !) I found that this abridgment was awkward and poorly done. It was choppy and many loose ends were never tied up (like Stahl's husband's bout with depression). I particularly disliked the way it did not segue gracefully from one topic to another but abruptly changed topics.I did like hearing about the minutae of her reporter's life and a lot of insider information about the presidents. I was fairly horrified to hear of Reagan's apparent mental decline during his years in office. Very scary.I also liked Stahl's honest opinions about many of the CBS brass. I am sure not all of them appreciated it.Looking forward to reading the book!"
2,"Popular not expert view, bigotry & ignorance present","Overall the book is a nice & easy reading. But, IMO, it only presents Lesley's personal and popular rather than an expert view of the political matters. One should treat her opinions with limited confidence. I loved the warm touches when Lesley talks about her Aaron. I hated an instance of bigotry and ignorance that I encountered on page 346, line 35 (hardcover). Referring to Bush's visit in Poland (July, 1989) she concludes: ""The Poles (with help from their friendly neighborhood Germans) had killed off their tradesmen, the Jews, in the 1940's."" Well, I don't need to explain that it is a historical & political fallacy, do I? What is less obvious is that it is a potentially harmful revisionist statement, possibly triggered by some ethnic prejudice."
3,Wishing She'd Have Been More Revealing...,"although overall it's a fine book about covering Washington politics. If I had more of a sense of Lesley as a person, it could have been a classic."
4,An interesting inside look at the television news business,"I enjoyed this look at television news from a woman's point of view. I've always admired Lesley Stahl, but knew little about her personal life. Her book is honest, and she is very forthcoming about how she was more career-driven than family-driven, and left much of the childrearing to her husband. It was slow in a few spots (harping quite a bit on Ronald Reagan) but all-in-all well worth reading!"
1,Her put down of Reagan is pathetic and shows her true colors,Ms. Stahl wants to make herself the most important person. A shame she couldn't take care of her child. I was very disappointed in this book and found her way of harping on all the negatives she could find very distressing. Too bad she couldn't have had a more positive experience in all those years. You gave a choice of 5 to 1 stars. I had to pick l but in reality would not give this book any stars.
3,"So much to work with, but....","I bought this book because Leslie Stahl has been at the forefront of all the big stories since I've been alive. One would naturally assume she had a huge ""library"" to pull stories from, and she does. The book is chock full of great anecdotes, but they seem to loose something in the telling, it feels like something is missing. As a reader, I enjoy being able to loose myself in the story and feel like I am along for the ride, however, I never felt that while reading this book. Like I mentioned, there are many, many great stories, however, they all seem to fall a bit flat in the telling. The book also jumps from personal anecdote to political anecdote, it does not flow smoothly. Regarding the personal stories, since the book never really goes too deep, it is hard to come away from this book without feeling like ""thank gosh she wasn't my mother""."
3,Not a page turner.,"Although the book wasn't too bad, it didn't seem to flow very smoothly. The storyline seemed choppy and the characters didn't seem to mesh. The premise for the story was good, but the style of writing did not make for a real page turner. The series of events which led up to Valentine Phipps having possession of the 'item of value' was interesting, and gives us a glimpse into history of how people came to hide items of value during wartime."
3,First time reader didn't find this series appealing...,"This is my first read of this author. I love the female PI series of Grafton, Evanovich and Kijewski so I was psyched to try Barnes.Unfortunately I found the sidekicks most annoying. Paolina, a surly teen who seems to be heading to a life of prostitution, and Roz, the painter/boarder, focuses on the next sexual partner above all, both of these women I didn't want Carlotta to hang with but she was loyal and true to these two. Perhaps previous books would have given me a since of history and caring for these sidekicks.Now the mystery didn't catch my interest either. Gwen, the volleyball buddy wasn't a good friend so I didn't care when she was arrested. The client that gets killed also didn't appeal.Summing it up, I'd try another book by this author but I'd like to find one where annoying characters don't rule Carlotta's life!"
2,"Really, really bad","This is my first time dipping into Barnes's Carlotta Carlyle series, and I can't say I was in any way impressed. This novel is both underwritten and clumsy, full of cliches, poorly drawn characters, false tension, silly narrative developments, and ultimately a revelation that makes absolutely no sense. I don't believe in putting spoilers in these reviews, so I won't describe the utterly absurd revelations that come at the end of this novel, but suffice to say that to call it half-baked would be to insult all the half-baked books out there. I am glad Barnes's many fans find enjoyment in her works, and I hope they can continue to do so, but for a reader who is looking for something other than a lifeless installment in a feisty female detective series, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
2,"a disappointing, disorganized imitation of previous reads","as much as i have enjoyed reading barnes books in the past, that's how disappointed i was in this book. its almost as if she felt obliged to keep her name current with no thought given to organization, rhyme or reason. thoroughly unlike barnes like."
2,Bummer,This started out with a bang but what a let down. One of the main characters barely had an ending. I have read all her books and I must say this was the worse. And why did the African American have to have a record as well as be a prostitute? Come on. I would not recommend this book to anyone
4,A Place Called Cool,"Somewhere between Mississippi and Texas is a place called Cool. Anson Funderburgh and the Rockets with Sam Myers are among the few remaining residents of this hip little community. ""Change In My Pocket,"" the bands latest effort on Bullseye, provides music fans with quality music that is all too lacking in today's overproducted, rock-influenced blues. The Muddy Waters flavored ""Highway Man"" is Anson and Sammy at their best but note the tasty piano fills ala Otis Spann offered up by John Street. This band has it all. ""You can't be the one for me"" is classic Anson and the Rockets with brilliantly simple drumming by Danny Cochran. If you are a fan of the blues this cd has to be part of your collection."
2,Review of Seagate Drive,"I have used the product a couple of times in the week or so that I have used it and find the built in software very user un-friendly. Not east to develope a backup scheme. I will try help menues further, but off the top, it is not easy to use the drive for a full system or drive backup"
4,"Nice drive, avoid the addons","I needed a ""big pendrive"", and this disk works just like that. It's small enough to be truly portable but holds enough data to allow me to backup my notebook once in a while, and keep some photos, videos and alike at hand.I would suggest to keep out of the software addons. I use SyncToy to backup my data, even when the drives comes with software I found too complicated and invasive to use. I drive is a drive, dont add a bag of crap to it."
4,"Fast, but a little power hungry.",The drive is quick (the save speed seems to be somewhere between 10 and 15 min per Gb) and the automatic file synching software is easy to set up. I really like the five year guarantee (which reflects -- I hope! -- Seagate's confidence in the product). My only complaint is that it needs to be connected to both of my laptop's USB ports in order to run (which forces me to disconnect my USB mouse and keyboard).
1,Don't Buy It !!!!!,I purchased this item and within 6 months it stopped working. I recommend not buying anything from seagate. Kick out the extra money and get a quality external drive (such as a LaCie drive) if your digital assets are of value to you.
3,Frustrated,"I received my FreeAgent Go in the mail 3 hours ago and was excited to see what looked like simple, straightforward directions. I soon found out that the directions are too simple - they make such a big deal about how easy to use it is that they fail to fully explain how to use it. After 45 minutes of not being able to backup my files, I tried to submit a question to online customer support. I was told the connection failed, so I called. I got someone I could barely understand, who could communicate no more than step by step directions. He also couldn't find my serial code number in their database. He walked me through how to do it, then told me to have a nice day. And it still doesn't work. I'm 23 and I'm not that bad with computers, and I've found this incredibly frustrating. Perhaps if I knew more about computers, I could fix the problem myself. As it is, I don't know about the ultimate quality of the hardware, but I know their customer support is sub par."
2,Drive works fine....software is crap,"As a backup drive this device works fine. However, the software isn't worth a cent. Cannot get the Creedo to load properly - sync does not work. I could have easily bought any drive to backup files onto...I wanted something that would sync every time I updated my photo files. Only way to do this with the Seagate FreeAgent Go is to copy and paste...an enormously inconvenient way to update my files everytime I make changes. Software comes pre-installed on drive with no CD. Have to contact Seagate support to get a ""recovery"" file if software becomes corrupted. Recovery file failed to fix anything!"
3,AVOID!!-update-2nd one also defective,"HD is actually only 150 gig and my older Maxtor drive that is only 4500 rpm has a faster read/write speed. Price point is good,other than that its just ok.Update-speed may be related to the fact that the drive died on the third day. Seagate support is not great, return (even after only working for 4 days) is at my cost. Gave up on phone support after 10 minutes on hold, on chat was unable to provide any technical support, just said to return item.2nd update-Seagate was very good about replacing the disk, but the replacement disk only worked for about an hour before it died also."
2,Died after 6 months,"I bought the external hard drive about six months ago and is now not functioning. Granted, it was a good product when it worked, the mac program time machine worked really well, and it was no problem to set up. However, I go to back the machine up and the computer doesn't recognize the device. The machine is lit up, but it starts softly beeping. I attempted to check the warranty status but the site is very unhelpful.Not worth the money."
1,Do not buy this hard drive,This product arrived and was non-functioning since the first day. The Seagate customer service representative clearly stated to me on the phone as we were troubleshooting that Seagate deliberately re-configured the design from a 2 USB port power system to the single system. Also Seagate had no warranty liability until after the 30 day post purchase time period.I have try'd to email Amazon and the merchant for return postage and re-ordering a new different external harddrive but there has been no response to date.
1,No thanks,"This drive for some stupid reason requires two USB ports to work and comes with bloatware pre-installed which pissed me off. I bought two of these, one died in 3 months and the other died in 5 months, I was not very impressed. I have a Western Digital drive that has been going strong for 4 years and a Maxtor old school drive that recently died after 9 years of use. I also read that alot of Seagate baracuda drives were bricked becasue of botched firmware.....im going to avoid Seagate."
3,Two USB ports required?!?!?!,"It requires 2 USB ports to work!! Most of external hard drives requires only one USB port, due to its conception: to be PRACTICAL! This is not practical at all! They should reduce to one USB port! Plus, its system (Ceedo) is much too unstable. It crashes a lot! Hopefully a Ceedo update should fix it."
2,"It works fine and looks nice, but it's VERY FLIMSY!","The rating I have given is based on the fact that this drive is extremelyflimsy. I have two of the older-style aluminum Seagate portable drives.Those are great drives. I bought this one to upgrade to a 160GB model, butI'll be returning it. You barely need to touch the top of it before the plasticcase bends inward significantly. I can't imagine this thing working for a weekif it was toted around on a regular basis. Seagate has appeared to sacrificeits characteristic product reliability for flashiness. Also, I really wish thatportable drive manufacturers wouldn't install software like Ceedo and U3without asking the customer first. These programs are just a nuisance."
1,Don't buy this product,"I am returning this product after being directly told by Seagate Technical support that it would not do what was promised on the box and all the advertising (""software that lets you take your desktop environment. . . to go""). I got suspicious when the start-up information gave no details on how to transfer your environment to run e-mail and Internet browsers on other computers with your data and preferences. This was confirmed by Technical Support, who said ""the software does not do this"" If all you want to do is back-up files, then the drive will work, but if you want the promised added features that make it ""FreeAgentGo"", then it doesn't."
1,This is NOT for 50 pair,"This is for one pair, although the in the product description it looks like it is for 50 pair. The spade connection is way too big to attach to home stereo equipment(Dynaco ST70 in this case, which has pretty standard size speaker wire screw attachments). I'd leave this one for the car audio folks."
5,"Wonderfully romatantic, beautifully arranged music.","Los Hermanos Martinez Gil eptomize the wonderfully romantic style of the Latin trio. I first heard their beautiful voices and soothing music while riding a bus for 23 hours from La Paz, Mexico to San Diego, California. Whether you understand Spanish or not, this lovely music will transfix and capture you, taking you to a slower more relaxed pace of life."
4,Great book- but not as complete as it could have been.,I do like this book- the photos are great- and the history of the company and of Madame Alexander is very well done. The only problem I have with it is that the Alexander company produced so many beautiful dolls over the years- and the book seemed to concentrate on the 1950's hard plastic dolls. I felt like it failed to show as many of the earlier dolls other than a couple here and there. I would have loved to see an extensive compiliation of the dolls such as the early cloth dolls and the composition dolls- there were so many and in such wonderful costumes. While I love the 1950's hard plastic dolls- for the money it just wasn't as complete as it could have been in my opinion.
2,Doesn't look like the photo,"It seems like a nice enough rash guard, but I can't handle the color - will have to return it. It's not actually a soft pink but a sort of neon pepto-bismol. Great if you like that - you'd be easy to spot."
4,Pretty good machine,I own 3 of these actually and I bought all 3 from amazon :) I own a small business and have other people involved its good to be able to network these laptops and share info easily. I think the speakers are not so great I play it on low but still it beats the toshiba that was a lemon from day one if I have 3 of these and no real big problems probably a safe bet and the price is not so bad either for a pentium.
1,Garbage,I wore these slippers once -- ONCE! -- and the memory foam is completely matted down and hard. My Walmart slippers with a year of wear have more cushion than these after 5 minutes. Do not buy.
1,INFERIOR INFERIOR--FORGET BUYING,"THESE SLIPPERS FALL APART FROM THE INSIDE AS WELL AS THE STITCHING...........TERRIBLE, A NEW PAIR LASTED LESS THAN A MONTH.THE SHARPER IMAGE SLIPPER WAS FAR SUPERIOR, BUT YOU CANT GET THEM ANYMORE."
5,Cozy,If your feet hurt or i you want something comfy and warm to wear this is the product. They really feel so good on my feet!
1,Misleading comfort,"If you really want to buy these, at least purchase them in one or two sizes smaller as they will not hold your feet in otherwise. At first slipping into them they feel great but as you try to actually wear them around the house (for me it's on tile floors) you'll experience your feet slipping out and an awful lot of sloshing around inside. If the upper outer was constructed of something more sturdy, they would be much better -- but the memory foam is really not enough cushion to make any claims about. And I'm not a very big person so they really should have been of more comfort to my frame."
5,perfection,"my mom lovrs these slippers, she has been saying that they are the best thing they ever invented"
2,Overpriced External Drive,"Despite the hype, this is just a 500 GB hard drive with backup software. But if you have a small business and store data on network drives that are mapped on your PC forget about using the bundled backup software to back up those files, it just doesn't. And, as far as I can tell, you can't tell the software to back up only at night, so it will be backing up while you are working. And, the ""internet drive"" backup requires a monthly or annual fee. The fee is HIGHER than other online backup services, presumably because of the tie-in with Seagate."
1,Seagate has lost a customer with this drive and their poor customer service.,"This is the first negative review I have ever left, and I hate doing it because I love Amazon and shop here way too much, however I feel the need to warn potential customers. This drive has never worked for me as an eSATA drive. And their supposed Tech support team was clueless as to why and even suggested it was a BIOS problem. Google this drive on the web and you will see how many other people are having the same problem. It works well as a USB drive, but I paid $40 more for an eSATA feature that has never worked. (I have another eSATA drive - not Seagate - that works perfectly). And Seagate refused to replace it insisting it was a BIOS problem - even though they have that 5 year warranty and the drive is less than 6 months old. I currently own 8 Seagate drives - internal and external. I will never buy another."
5,would not like to be without it,"Seagate ST305004FPA1E2-RK FreeAgent Pro 500 GB USB/eSATA External Hard DriveI already had installed a 300 GB Seagate internal harddrive for my desktop and it is just wonderful and now I have this one for my laptop. I backed up my laptop using Acronis and will be doing so every so often and I keep there my photos and videos. I like its appearance and it is truly just plug in and drag any files you want over to it, very very easy. Actually, on the ad the eSata model was listed only with a one year warranty but when I received my Seagate external hard drivem it also came with a 5 year warranty which makes me feel good."
4,"Seems to run hot, but does the job","Good external hard drive, but I did not care for the backup software that came with it. Invest in a better backup software."
3,It is always hot,"I leave this external drive on all the time. I can see the light kind of dims if there are no activities for a while. But it is still quite hot to touch. It comes with a utility to set the sleep time. But I have no way to tell if it is working.I don't like the autoback software it comes with from Memeo. The software is a Windows app not Windows service. That means you have to login, run it for it to sync the files. It also asks you for admin password if the login user is not admin. Besides, it crashes my machines for a couple of times. I ended up uninstalling it.The power switch is not responding well as documented by other users.Overall, I am not very impressed. You may want to consider getting an enclosure if you want to have better selections of hard drives. Get a copy of Acronis True Image for backup. You will be spending the same amount of money or less and have a reusable enclosure down the road."
2,"Buy the NON-PRO version, the online backup is WORTHLESS","I bought the PRO version to have online backup ability. They offer 500 MB free for the trial version and you can purchase up to 5 GB for $12 a month. This seems USELESS to me, as most people purchasing a hardrive of 320, 500, or 750 GB are going to need much more backup space. I can store 5 GB for free on my hotmail account. What was their marketing department thinking when they only offer 5 GB of online backup, and even the price for that is high?The hardrive itself is a good price, and besides the fact that the first one I bought was DOA (I think it was the cheap power supply that didn't work) the hardware is fine. Buy the non-PRO version!"
2,ESATA didn't work out of the box - DON'T BUY,"I spent $50 more on a product that would support esata. When it didn't work, I called Tech Support so I could talk to 'thomas' who spoke with a THICK accent. 2 calls to 2 clueless people got me nowhere. On the second call, while waiting, I did a google search for 'esata freeagent' and found 100 others with similar problems: esata doesn't work, esata hangs, esata gets errors with large files, etc. If you want to use a usb drive, get one the same size but 50 bucks cheaper. I'm returning, and have ordered a different brand."
1,bad experience,"I kept it for a week, then went and exchanged it for another brand. A week to back up my 40GB laptop seems, heh, more than enough.There's lots good about this product (the look, the box, the installation process, the capacity), but if it can't reliably and quickly back stuff up then it's useless.I think this is a software issue. If they fix the software, this could be a good product, but right now my recommendation is: AVOID.Things they need to fix with the backup software:- make it usably fast (the UI itself and the backup speed - for large numbers of small files)- make it reliable! I gave it three goes to back up my laptop and it failed each time (got stuck and wouldn't continue, or just lost track of and wouldn't recognise a partial backup)- make the UI easier to grok"
1,Totally worthless,"I just want to echo the numerous complaints already registered here, and elsewhere, about the Free Agent Pro hard drive. I actually had a 320 gb model, but the problems I had were identical to those mentioned in these comments - overheating, losing access to important data, unresponsive support. Sure, the hard drive worked fine for awhile - but then once I had transferred loads of important data it began to fall apart. I guess my biggest problem with Seagate is that with so many nearly identical, catastrophic failures of these units, they should've issued a voluntary recall and refund. Instead, I was told that I could pay $30 shipping for the privilege of replacing a fundamentally corrupt unit with another one, as well as unknown fees for data recovery. So as far as I'm concerned Seagate is off the list of reliable vendors of anything. Lesson learned."
1,Don't buy,"Don't buy this unless you don't mind the constant clock-ticking in your hard drive as the autobackup works in the background. Actually, it does not work in the background. It's very annoying."
4,Great external HD!,"Fast and silent, I love this external HD. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the software expires after 30 days. I love the col orange glow (reminds me of the same color of my dashboard in my 2003 Infiniti g35 Coupe). Only thing I didnt like is that there is no flashing light for HD access. Maybe Im just old school but I like flashing lights! Access is quick and this serves as a network drive for a desktop, laptop and my Xbox 360. I'm impressed ! Also, the drive I purchased had a switchable plate for usb 2.0 and firewire connections. This was much appricated as all my usb 2.0 ports are taken up. I installed a 3 port firewire card foe my sony DCR-pc105 camcorder and plugged it into one of the free ports. Great speed and ease of connection!"
3,rowing faster but train with more brain,a few of the articles were below the scope of this book. But in general it is interestesting and pertinent information
2,Rowing Faster,"This book is not made for rower athlete, is more dedicated to rower coaches. Is has too much technical information tat athletes are not familiar with."
4,A wonderful book!,"Perhaps the finest book I've read on the practice and history of Japanese Swordsmanship.The text is clear, the pictures are accurate and the information is priceless. As a Sensei of IaiJutsu swordsmanship, I highly recomend this book."
1,Needs more detail,"Although this book has a good plot outline, it leaves it like that-- just an outline. I found it hard to imagine the setting because of the lack of detail.The characters are not explored at all, and I couldn't relate to any of them. The major characters were uninteresting and lacked detail.This book, while based around a very moving historical event, is one of my least favorite books."
1,How can you tell....,"if it's a good movie when you can't hear a word being spoken. Terrible, and I mean brutal audio makes it impossible to make out what the characters are saying. DVD's like this are more frustrating than they are worth the effort to watch. It's only a movie for God's sake! I should be able to hear it. 25 minutes was all I could last."
3,"More like ""Slap Happy""...","In 1964, The Beatles were the biggest thing to hit America since....Elvis Presley.In 1964, Elvis Presley was making movies. Among them for this year were GIRL HAPPY and TICKLE ME.The irony is that the ""King of Rock and Roll"" was making these second (and sometimes third) rate movies. Following the formula of G.I. BLUES and BLUE HAWAII (and countless others afterward), GIRL HAPPY puts Elvis in Fort Lauderdale where he is assigned to look after a mobster's daughter, played by Shelley Fabares.The movie isn't the worst Elvis picture, but it's sure not as entertaining as his 50s pictures or even VIVA LAS VEGAS.The songs are quite trite in this picture, there really are no standouts (Only ""Puppet on a String"" comes close).But, for a lite little comedy, GIRL HAPPY does deliver. Just don't expect too much from this other than a piece of fluff."
4,Boxed set of Elvis Movies,It included many of the movies we were looking for and seems in very good condition. We have not watched them all so we are unsure if all work well but we are pleased.
3,Elvis at the Space Needle,"One of Elvis Presley's better musicals, ""It Happened at the World's Fair"" benefits from its Seattle locations, some decent songs (notably ""One Broken Heart for Sale"" and ""They Remind Me Too Much of You"") and a terrific fight scene. Elvis delivers a good-natured performance in this entertaining travelogue. Directed by Hollywood veteran Norman Taurog, the 1963 production was Presley's first post-Army assignment for MGM - followed by the dazzling ""Viva Las Vegas."""
4,ELVIS DOING THE CLAM!!!,"Excellent Elvis vehicle, Great music for the flick as well. unfortunatly the last of the quality Presley movies. Some great scene stealing from many good quality actors and actress. Good outing for Presley although he should have been able to retire after this one."
3,Must Agree With Hunter,"I love Elvis, but I agree with Hunter on the packaging. I've never bought a boxed set that came with different type and size cases. The two larger snap cases do not fit in the box. I thought the guy I purchased from had re-packaged, too, but he said he didn't and I guess he didn't. I have a huge collection and this is the worse packaged. But, I love the movies so I gave it 3 stars."
4,Girl Happy proves fun for Elvis fans.,"Okay, say what you want about Elvis Presley's movies, but some of them were actually a lot of fun. Girl Happy is one of those. Elvis and his band travel to Fort Lauderdale for the annual pilgramage of college students for spring break. He is there to perform at a local club and to keep an eye on Shelley Fabares, not a bad job. Fabares adds some extra zest to this forumulaic Elvis movie. The songs are pretty good too with the title track along with Cross My Heart Hope to Die, Puppet on a String and my favorite, Meanest Girl in Town in which Shelley shakes things up, literally. I remember going to the local theater when I was about 13 or 14 to see this movie, then I bought the soundtrack to it and played the grooves off the record. This movie is a lot of fun and can be pretty nostalgic as well as a bit of a piece of pop history."
4,A fun Presley movie with a decent script,"I recently bought Girl Happy and saw it for the first time. I have seen most of Elvis' movies, and this one was actually one of the better ones considering the standard Presley formula.The tunes are pretty good, Elvis is one the beach with pretty girls and the storyline of babysitting their boss' daughter while on vacation in Ft. Lauderdale was neat.It is a fun movie designed to entertain, and it does just that. And Elvis breaking into a song is more believable since he is the leader of a combo, not a race car driver or a frogman.Elvis and Shelley Fabares have great on-screen chemistry, nearly as good as he and Ann-Margret from Viva Las Vegas.Sit back, relax and enjoy two hours of fun in the sun with Elvis, doing the Clam, speeding through downtown Ft. Lauderdale pulling a boat, getting into fights, breaking ""into"" jail and later escaping dressed as a woman, courtesy of a quick change with help from a stripper!"
1,Frat boy/Cutesy girl Hurl Fest,"This has the best of the mindless fun boys meet cute girls type story. You couldn't get more brain dead, cheesy and sickening than this. And talk about reducing Elvis to a boyband artist.I thought Double Trouble had an awful story mostly thanks to ultra-cute ""Jill"" in that movie, but this one is worse. The usual 'we're cool"" because we're wise cracking frat boy wannabes with lame tunes and girls.As far as Elvis movies goes, the fun ones are really Stay Away Joe and also Live a little. Do the clam is a good song but so long as you stick to the audio and not the movie scenes with Elvis at his Justin Timberlake best.The serious ones I have temporarily forgotten because the awfulness of this one has clouded those out."
2,eh,The novelty of seeing Elvis fulfilled within 15 minutes. It was pretty much a big ad for the most part.
3,search for this video for my collection,Hi i am collecting elvis movies for fun and as a hobby! I need these title (change of habit........ easy come easy go... girls girls girls............. harum scarum..... loving you.... it happened at the world fair............ wild in the country... I leave in Canada Quebec and i am waiting and hopping for a answer.......thank you merci beaucoup.... LUIS
1,Superior Beach Movie - Inferior Elvis Movie,"After rising to dramatic challenges in movies like ""Flaming Star"", ""Follow That Dream"" and many scenes in ""Roustabout"", etc., the Hollywood assembly-line yielded this fairly entertaining but hopelessly dated Presley vehicle. Too bad that several '50s-styled rockers (""The Meanest Girl In Town"" [picked up on by Mr. Bill Haley as ""She's Evil""], ""Startin' Tonight"", and ""I've Got To Find My Baby"") are marred by cartoonish characters sharing Elvis' spotlight."
4,GRAND OLD FUN,ELVIS WAS PURE ELVIS...MUSIC WAS GREAT...PICTURE AND SOUND WAS EXCELLENT. THIS IS THE WAY TO VIEW OLD MOVIES...ESPECIALLY GRAND ELVIS MOVIES.
5,MY FAVORITE ELVIS MOVIE!!!!,"This is by far my favorite Elvis movie to date. It's just such a fun spring break movie with girls, beaches and most importantly, Elvis. I have been watching this movie since I was kid. My grandmother was a huge fan and loved watching his movies and got me into, not only his music but also his movies. I have been searching over the last few years for this on DVD. And now the day has finally come, it's here YEAH!!!!"
5,Elvis DVD Movie Collection,"Very satisfied with the product (i.e. Elvis Movie Collection), the timely delivery, and the recipients response to the gift (always a bonus!). Thank you for making my shopping simple, efficient, and holding up to your end of the bargain!*Kristin"
3,Great to have but could've been better,FINALLY we get the last of Elvis' movies on DVD (except Elvis On Tour)...Charro looks great! The others look OK but several song sequences are OUT OF SNYC! Who's in charge of quality control??
1,Very Dated Presley movie.,"Although this movie still holds great appeal for fans, and does have a fun plotline and some real 1950's styled rockers (actually mixed better for the film than for the soundtrack album!), it is tough to watch Elvis try to do his thing while always surrounded by cartoonish characters - he's never properly spotlighted in the production numbers, one which includes his first really ludicrous lyric, ""Do The Clam"", a number which nonetheless has a fantastic duelin' guitar & sax. (Interesting sidelight: Mr. Bill Haley also cut the uptempo ""The Meanest Girl In Town"" as ""She's Evil"", PRESUMEABLY after hearing the soundtrack). [Movie has High Embarrassment Factor of 8]."
1,All these reviews are not for this item.,The 1 star was to get everybody's attention. All the reviews for Elvis 75th Anniversay DVD Collection are for some other titles and also VHS. Where are the reviews for this DVD item????????
1,Dated even then.,"I saw this picture three times back in '65 and enjoyed it each time. The Fort Lauderdale setting and spirited songs (many delivered in '50s style) was enough to bring me back. But today, although it is still regarded as a ""fun flick"", I *avoid* it each time (along with ""Spinout"")."
1,DVD's & packaging appear used,"When I received the Elvis DVD collection the box was in poor condition. Also, the DVDs appeared used and/or copies of the originals. Each DVD came in different packaging and some of the DVD's were missing a DVD label on them. Not the quality I expected for a DVD collection. I bought them for a christmas gift but after receiving them I was too embarassed to present them as a gift. Quite disappointing. This was the 1st item I purchased an Amazon item that was poor quality."
3,VHS movie,"This item was in very good condition when I read the profile, received item today was in clamshell case but movie not in good condition. Will not purchase from this seller again.Thank youRita"
4,fun to watch,"My granddaughter has fallen in love with Elvis (she's gonna be 9) and there are certain movies of his that she wants for her collection and this one happens to be one of them and I can't find it anywhere! I called Blockbuster customer service and for whatever reason this movie is out of print as of February of this year. Their only suggestion was to rent it and make a copy of it! I see that there are alot of others who would also like this movie so until (if ever) they re-release it, this is the only way to get it or wait and see if it comes on TV and tape it.How in the world can they stop releasing any of Elvis' movies?I wanted to give my granddaughter this movie as her birthday present but now I don't know if I can."
5,The best soundtrack of Elvis in the 60's,"This movie is, to me, the best Elvis did in the 60's, surpassed only by Viva las Vegas. The soundtrack is great, the majority of the songs belongs to good old rock'n'roll, and the presence of Shelley Fabares is also exciting. In this movie is pure electricity between her and Elvis(the briiliant ending when Elvis, dressed in black, sings a reprise of the beautiful title song, and Shelley dances with him). The Meanest Girl in Town, I've got to find my Baby, Do the Clam, Startin'Tonight, Spring Fever and Puppet on a String are songs that reveals the true potential of the King, very far from the poor quality songs from Harum Scarum, Kissin'Cousins and others. It is a very entairtaining movie and in my country(Romania) still remains the most cherished Elvis's movie. I saw this film 20 times and I knew many people who likes to see it one more time."
4,Unique and thought provoking,I had the opportunity to read this book and my wife read it shortly thereafter. It's an excellent discourse and I recommend that couples as well as women and girls alone read it.
2,A psychological book!,"I am very disappointed with this book, because, according to the information given by my fellow citizen Paulo Meira de Vasconcelos, the book would offer deep visions of the Cult of Yia-Mogun or Yia-Mi Osoronga. And it is not that that happens, a lot for the I thwart, superficial indications are just pointed in the book. It is not a book for people that look for a real knowledge in the Cult of the Mothers... Unhappily, it was used as reference, greetings to the Mothers, done in Bahia, when invocations and Prayers traditional, still used by true priests and Priestesses, that know the Real value of Yia-Mogun they could be mentioned in your totality, without there was a secret break! Now, of the psychological and social point of view, he is really very good."
5,Great case study book,"This book is a very good case study book for anyone interested in business. I am a professor at a university and I will be using this book for a contemporary issues class. The cases are short and without financial information, so they are simple enought for most people to understand and analyze. Great read."
2,Horrible book,"This book is actually three short books in one volume. The first one is a very interesting interview with Jim Thompson's publisher. Well written.Next up: : ""Child of Rage"" a very disjointed, horrible novel. Not up to the standards of Mr. Thompson's other work. If you have not read Mr. Thompson, may I suggest ""The Killer Inside Me"" or ""The Ripoff""? (Certainly not this piece of trash!)Finally we get a novelette ""To See A Man About a Horse"" which is essentialy ""Child of Rage"" from a different Vantage point. Better written. I somewhat enjoyed this one.In summary:Interview: 4 starsChild of Rage: 0 starsTo See A Man About a Horse: 2 stars.Average:2 stars"
2,Builtins bad or fail after time,"ADI AD1888JCPZ High Definition Audio: scratchy sound from the start.Marvell 88E8001 Gigabit LAN: controller died. Not seen any more by XP or Linux(Knoppix,Ubuntu)Does run Core 2 Duo okay. Can't speak to overclocking."
3,Boring but informative,"Ceaser provides a less-than-engrossing account of the three major changes in presidential selection processes throughout the history of the US, starting with the founding fathers, moving on to Martin Van Buren, and finishing with Woodrow Wilson. The author wrote it as his Harvard thesis, so that should be some indication of how interesting the book is. I read it for a college course on the Presidency, and it was very informative, but not exactly pleasure reading."
5,Terrific product!,"Very easy to install; we used the existing hooks in our house and garage originally installed for the laundry line. Our medium-sized dog is neither aggressive nor a 'puller', so this size trolley works well to keep him outside with the family. He has plenty of room to move and explore, yet is amply contained and safe."
2,Kinda Cheap,Thought this was a great deal until I received it and found that the pulley assembly is completely made of plastic that is sure to break soon and the clasp's are rusting and are very hard to open by next spring I am sure I will need to buy a better quality dog run
3,Overly complicated,"The instructions that come with this are impractical. You'll end up Rube-Goldbering this item to your needs rather than installing as instructed. I don't know why they bother with the pulley at all- the 10ft leash with its metal ""loop"" connector things slides just fine across the 50ft line, no pulley needed. The 50ft cord comes with no ends on it whatsoever, you need tools to hook it to the included clamps, I wish the 50ft had the same ends as the 10ft cord and this would be perfect."
1,3 MAJOR COMPONENTS DEAD...WOW!,"Laptop was over $2000 when bought new. Came LLOOAADDEDD with junkware (e.g., worthless demo software). Took hours to remove all of it. So far: 1) graphics card, battery, mouse key are allll broken just after warrenty expired. All components are SUPER cheap. This laptop is the worst constructed, engineered piece of crap I've ever used and guess what, I paid premium price for it! Expect no more out of Sony."
2,"Gorgeous screen, impossible battery life","The screen is gorgeous, almost liquid, and the PC runs fairly fast. It is lightweight and looks good. But the battery life is so bad that I would never, never buy this computer again. It used to last about 90 minutes on max power saver mode. Now, a year later, it lasts less than an hour on power saver mode. If I go for full screen brightness, it's gone in 30 minutes.Also, the quantity of crapware that Sony puts on is stupendous. It took me hours to remove. Then, there was a repair needed, so I sent it back to Sony, who fixed the machine, wiped out my hard drive, and sent it back, guess what, reloaded with all of the crap."
1,SHAME,"Sony is very well know for their high quality notebooks, nevertheless this model is a shame. Let me be very clear this model is a outrage with sony clients.* It takes forever to start.* it has more than 40 unuseful trials (Thats right 40, I am not kidding)* It does nto have bluetooth (The cheapest mobile phone in the market may have it)*Premium Price*When you open IE (4 tabs open eachone of them is a advertisment. something like Buy Adobe, Buy smartdraw ....)SONY THIS IS MY LAPTOP NOT YOURS. THIS IS FOR MY PERSONAL USE NOT YOUR ADVERTISEMENT, UNLESS OF COURSE YOU GIVE ME IT FOR FREE. BUT I HAVE PAID ALMOST US$ 2000SONY YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED."
3,Uniform complaints,I considered buying this computer. But uniformly everyone including C Net and PC magazine have same complaints about the junk that Sony puts into this fine computer.(Hope SONY is listening). Did anyone hear about the Mac coming out with a very light weight small screen SONY killer?
3,Good Training,"Good price for an educational mass set, could use a decent box but other than that its OK for a brass not for trade mass set"
5,20 STARS......MUST READ!!!!,"I read this book and went on a fast for a week. I wrote down what I was fasting for and Prayed over the list. You would not believe the results!!! I am making it a habit to go on a Fast at least once a month and when the Lord leads. This book is a must read, because he tells you what he experienced because of Fasting. If you are like me, you want to know the truth and he tells the truth and uses scripture to back it up. If you want to go higher in God, purchase this book and start studying the scriptures on Fasting. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"
2,Not what I expected,The book was mostly about the authors personal experiences and doing miracles. One page on how to fast. Not really want I expected.
3,Fast to Hear Him Now,"I was looking for a book to learn about fasting. This is the book I found on Amazon. I was not disappointed in the least. Not only does this man know about fasting, He has lived it and there is much fruit to what he has done. He gives practical advice and wisdom to allow you to walk out this lost practice in our culture. There is power in this walk with God that has gone untapped. Tap into it and you will understand that there is more to this Christian walk than just fire insurance and waiting to die just to go to Heaven. There is more, try a fast and prove Him."
3,Don't believe the hype,"OK-I understnad that Family Man is one of the best bassist's of all-time. But, This CD is just not that good. To begin with, it's all the leftovers that were not strong enough to make the original albums. I would only buy this as the last piece of my Wailers collection."
3,Don't blieve the hype,"OK-I understnad that Family Man is one of the best bassist's of all-time. But, This CD is just not that good. To begin with, it's all the leftovers that were not strong enough to make the original albums. I would only buy this as the last piece of my Wailers collection."
2,Don't buy if you are a Newbie,"This set is designed to help you manuever in China if you are traveling. Although, I thought the concepts and areas it touched on were helpful, I found the instruction pace awkward to person new to the language. Many complex statements require more than one time to hear and repeat. I was frustrated because the CD did not allow me to go back to the exact place that I was listening. The narrator would say the phrase in english then in Chinese, briefly pause, then go to another phrase. My gosh, I wouldn't know if I was even close with some phrases. I think you've had some exposure to Chinese this might be helpful. If not, look at First 100 Words in Chinese."
5,Quality Calipers,"Sturdy construction, comes with a hard black plastic sheath that includes centimeter markings. Simple device, reasonable price, and has been a useful tool on my medicine rotation."
4,dood quality for money,Excellent service - speedy delivery with a report of when and where to expect my goods. The calipers are of good quality and really useful for ecg interpretation.
1,Junk,Very cheap and crappy you can buy a better pair at any local college or tech school for less than what they sell them here. Should have believed the other reviewers.
3,Works fine..,"I guess I thought it would tighten down so you wouldn't lose your measurement, but it doesn't. I don't think any of them do though."
1,"Oh, pleeeeaaaase","Sheesh... I've been living in Paris for about 7 months and got this book from another ex-pat. I thought it would be fun. I think it was really an excuse for the author to meet well known French women and get into exclusive/expensive stores. I found most of it to be pat, over generalized, contradictory and highly stereo-typed. The book describes a small percentage of French women, primarily the elite, but not necessarily. The average french woman is not as different as the book would have you believe. Yes, there are some truths in there: you will rarely see any french people, male or female, wearing sneakers unless they are on their way to or from some form of exercise. Yes, you will rarely see clinically overweight people, male or female. I think the author should have focused more on her own experiences and generalized a lot less. Peter Mayle did a much better job on this and his books are much more enjoyable."
3,mildly entertaining,Nothing new. The book is just okay. Not as amusing as I thought it would be. Enjoyed Paris to the Moon a lot more.
3,burns,I liked it. Didn't get the results I had hoped for. My head felt like it was on fire. My ends turned blue.
5,Julio,Enjoying 1100 Bel Air Place. Reminds me of younger days. Very good sound with lots of good memories.
1,I was embarrassed,"I needed a Spanish music CD for my Spanish class, so I bought Enrique Guzman's. When I started to play the CD, my entire class started laughing,and eight people simultaeneously said, ""What the heck is this?"" To make a long story short I was humiliated in front of my whole class. The music was a very poor attempt to immitate some American music at the time. It was a very noble idea but some of the words don't translate into Spanish and rhyme at the same time. It was a great attempt, but I can't reccomend this CD."
4,Pigs in a Blanket,"I first saw this movie in its theatrical release. All of my work peers saw it as well and it seems that it was all we talked about. Yes, it was starnge, but oddly comical as well. Someone even had a dinner party serving up some of the Shelly Duvall's character's favorite recipes. It was a truely visionary and idiosyncratic Robert Altman movie and was compared to Bergman's ""Persona"". I taped it from t.v. once, but it was so cut up and disjointed that I eventually taped over it and decided to wait until it eventuall came out on video. And now I've ordered it and I'm so excited. Can't wait to see how it has held up."
5,"Strange, dreamlike, and disturbing","Very weird psychological drama from Robert Altman, featuring Sissy Spacek as a mousy woman who befriends the talkative but equally unpopular Shelley Duvall when they both work in a rehab center. As the roommates increasingly crash and have conflicts, they enter into an odd connection with a third woman, who makes disturbing art when her philandering husband is off....well, philandering. Atmospheric and bizarre but tame enough to get a PG rating."
5,(Salad:is to:Dressing) as (3 Women: is to: Confusing),"When i first watched 3 women, i wondered what i was watching? I enjoy Sissy Spaceck and Shelly Duvaull is good too, but what in the world is this movie. It reminded me of an acid trip. Even though it was strange, the plot was very original, it sent out some messages, and the acting was superb."
5,Just to clarify...,"This film is absolutely wonderful. For the reviews who didn't like it or understand it...SPOILERS...The whole film was a dream (at least, my interpretation). Just like Mulholland Drive, where the first 2/3 of the movie was a dream. If you look at again in that way, you will ""understand"" the film. Do we all really understand all of our dreams?"
2,Stop projecting and SEE what a pretentious film this is.,"Altman may have been the most over-rated filmaker in the United States. What we see in this film is the work of a person with superb technical skills being applied by one with the vision of an ambitious film student. Disolves are disjointed and ambiguous---not ""because they are meant to be"" but because Mr. Altman has lost all sight of his narrative. This happens ALOT. No excuses, Mr. Altman. You are stillriding on your ill-deserved rep. For excellent film-making see ANYthing by Jaques Tati. Nuff said. And to all you out there, impressed by this film: what WAS going on in your life when you saw it, and were SOOO impressed?"
5,Phenomenal. Stunning on every level.,"This movie is what the 70's seemed like it was about. Incredibly drawn characters, fascinating, in depth character sketches, and just plain incredible filmmaking. Like I always say about most reviews, if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all. This is just amazing filmmaking, from the cinematography to the acting, to the directing. Wow. When Shelley Duvall comes down to the party at the pool. Unbelievable! Her dialogue is so amazing you just can't believe it. Completely specific to that character. If only they could make movies like this today. But alas, they don't."
5,I love this film.,"The film's plot is filled with twisted, violent images of the harsh desert landscape setting and the artist's (Janice Rule) writhing paintings on the bottom of the swimming pool. The film's characters are rootless, lonely people seemingly swept up to this miserable place because they have nowhere else to go and they bond together because they have nobody else to turn to. Spacek's Pinky latches onto Duvall's Millie not just to be her friend but to be her. Dominance in relationships flies back and forth but finally comes to land perfectly in an ending where all the plot pieces come to a satisfying resolution. In my view, the film is a classic work of art. It was a treasure to find it on Amazon."
3,Only in dreams,"The dreamiest and most oblique of Robert Altman's '70s classics (granting that IMAGES and QUINTET cannot plausibly be deemed ""classics""), 3 WOMEN is a compellingly weird bit of self-indulgence from the deepest recesses of Altman's brain. In fact the director has revealed that the genesis of this movie was an actual dream he had, and it shows in the movie's atmospheric visuals, deliberate pacing and aura of mystery. Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA also seems to be an influence, as this film encroaches on similar territory of two women living together whose identities seem to merge in ambiguous ways. The pairing of Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall, two of the most unique and odd female presences in '70s cinema, contributes to the offbeat personality of this ""only-in-the-70s"" American art film. I wouldn't call it one of Altman's best, but it's a fascinating artifact of a period where such compellingly weird bits of self-indulgence were financed and released by the major Hollywood studios."
5,Willie/Millie/Pinky/Edgar,"In a desert swimpool,pregnant Willie paints Egyptian style images of powerful males who stand alone & females writhing in anger. In the real world nearby,this is thinly disguised by ritualized social behavior. Enter lonely Millie(ShellyDuvall)who tries too hard & people could care less. Enter Pinky (Sissy Spacek) who forgot to grow up & wants a big sister. Briefly they enjoy a tiny world of their own. Enter Hollywd has-been Edgar who ignores wife Willie & wants to play Tarzan for Millie & Pinky & it all hits the fan. Great acting,satire,mean spirited"
4,Spirits and Celebrations,"I'm kind of mad this book is out-of-print since I read it once at a library and haven't been able to find it since. This book is filled with anecdotes and spiritual quests, as well as a large selection of spiritual traditions celebrated throughout the world. This book gives you a brief glimpse at various indigenous holidays throughout the world. Worth picking up if you find it by some miracle."
5,Out of print? AWFUL,"This is a wonderful American book. It covers celebrations from all over the world and is incredibly diverse. Teish not only gives the reader an insight on the religion of her family, Oshun, she embraces many of the customs and traditions of the earth-based religions of the world. This book is a MUST have if you are a student/practitioner of any earth-based faith/path/religion."
5,Great for learning,I like to keep my sailboat in tune. This book gives good information for the beginer on how to tune and rig your sailboat. Take a sailing class and get this book. You'll be ready to sail safely.
5,Excellent sail tuning guide,"This is one impressively written book. It is concise, yet very illustrative and well-organized. I just started sailing a few months ago and have been reading several books. This was the first book that focused on sail trimming and rigging that really presented the theory and application in a reliably logical manner. I do think that one needs to have quite a number of hours of sailing behind them to truly understand this book as it presents some advanced trimming concepts (I would not have understood any of it day one). But if you have mastered the basic concepts of sail trim and points of sail and are now looking to get the most out of your sail plan, then you should buy this book. You can take it right on board with you and experiment step-by-step in various winds and water conditions."
2,What about the simple stuff???,"I've been sailing for years and just got by knowing the basics. I decided it was time to get better at tuning the sails so I got this book. It's way too advanced for me. I wanted to know the basics--when to use the boom vang and how, when to use the genoa travelers and how, sail shape to shoot for and how to get it. What I found was excruciating detail about ajusting the forestay, the scientific explanation of all kinds of stuff, and very little basics. It's not a thick book, but the nature of the writing makes it a very very slow read. If you've been racing for years and want to get that extra 5% get this book. If you want some straightforward general pointers on improving how you tune sails look elsewhere."
4,Almost Terrific,"I hope that Ivar improved the organization of this book for the more recent edition. I had to skip around between several different sections to ferret out how to manage helm balance, and its relationship to changing jibs and reefing the main. He should also update his aerodynamics section to show total force always behind the cord of the sail. I've sailed sloops for years, and I still learned a lot from this book loaned to me by a friend, including how to manage helm balance. I'm here to buy it so I have it in my seachest."
3,A very graphical explanation of rigging and trim issues,"The graphics are very good and convey a lot of good information, yet I have trouble agreeing with much of what the author is recommending. It is another case, for me, of not liking the sailmaker's point of view. Examples of my disagreement include his recommendations regarding the use of the vang and the trim of the spinnaker."
1,I want my money back!,"The book is hard to follow and the topics are vague and shallow. The first edition was about Internet sites, from adult to gaming and everything in between. The second edition includes security topics? I think Wallace is out of his league and I want my money back!!"
4,"Very good book, but almost the same as the frist...","Don't get me wrong ""Steal this Computer Book 2"" is very informal and a good read. But I have the 1st edison and I was going to buy the second one but thanks to book stores, I read a little of the 2nd edison and to my amazement they were ""Alot"" alike. So if you got the frist one I wouldn't buy the 2nd edition...But on the othere hand this book is Great. With many storys ""True or Not"" Are very interesting, and give you alot of ideas of what you could do ""With time on your hands."" Also, I like how the author gives you links to sites where to get more info/programs for the articles in the book.But if you don't have this book. ""Buy It!"""
3,Pickup a copy of...,"It is a very good book for a beginner and it include a useful, although somewhat dated, CD too. The book will tell you what they won't tell you about the Internet. It will give you just enough information to be dangerous which is all you really need, anyhow. Remember, they will WIN the war but YOU can make the battle costly! A superior Wang for a inferior Bang!;-)Selah,Chess"
1,One of the Most Obsolete Books Ever,"The copyright date of this book is 2001, but if feels like it is 1985. The author mainly dwells on security issues for DOS, but he occasionally mentions ""newer"" operating systems like Windows 95 (sic!). Why the word ""internet"" is prominent in the title, is beyond me. What is said about the internet is little and shallow. Windows XP and MacOS X are never mentioned and everytime Windows 2000 is briefly mentioned, you can feel that the author adds it, just to prove that some things in the text have been updated at least once the last 10 years. The accompanying CD contained not one single program that interests me today."
2,Thick yet thin.,"This book would be great for someone about 12 years old with an interest in computers or someone who doesn't know anything about the internet. If you consider yourself a geek then this book is not for you. Some of the history in the book is very interesting, but that history can be found elsewhere. This book doesn't cut it. If I could go back in time, I would buy ""Hacking Exposed"" or some asm book. Believe the bad reviews from other reviewers. I didn't."
3,Great... 5 Years Ago,"I would have loved to have this info 5 years ago, if I was a beginner. This is a must for script kiddies and people who like to dink around with others. Explains trojans, scams, and minor script kiddy things well. Good for beginners."
1,Cliche and useless,"This book is heavily based on stereotypes of older women and younger men. There isn't any useful information here for women or men. Nothing in the book is new, interesting, or fun."
2,Go get a pedicure,"I've dated several younger men, and this book was very much a disappointment, and bordering on insulting at times. The author tries to use a humorous take on the subject, but does not succeed. Save the $[...] and get a pedicure instead."
2,Cougar,I can't even remember why I bought this book in the first place when I was single. It's just not for me. Maybe I will give it to my mother-in-law.
2,You Go Grandma!,"Length:: 8:32 MinsHi, Bernard Chapin saying hello and here's my review of this book...which is assuredly a contrarian view."
2,Guys have a little self respect....,"When I was young and out playing, I had a bit more self respect than to prey on older women, who for the most part were pathetic and needy. There were a couple of bars in Houston that were notorious for the number of older unattached women present, who would go home with you pretty much for the price of a drink. I was no angel, but I drew the line at that. My friends had no such compunctions, but I found the whole atmosphere demeaning and pathetic. This book seems to make it stylish and has given it a cache', kind of like Clinton did with casual oral sex."
5,Liberty has never been so clear!,Excellent reading in this pamplet that describes how blinded we are and how close today resembles the tyrany that the founders were fighting against. Every American and Human should read this.
4,Good reading,If you want to know a little more about USA's history then read this book. I know most dont care or have the time but this is a good book.
5,Paine's common sense,"Thomas Paine's clear and concise writings make him one of the greatest political authors of his time. Basic thoughts of freedom and democracy, that seem so common place nowadays, were brought about because of Paines ""radical"" ideas. His books Common Sense and The Rights of Man were written not just for the political philosopher but also for the common man. Both the aforementioned books played a big part in the American and French Revolutions."
3,Not Nearly as Brillant as Expected,"Of all the great thinkers, I thought Paine would have some great, original ideas to speak about. Its just a bunch of big words, slightly fastidious. I wasn't personally impressed..."
5,Jesse Stone's NO Remorse Review,This character fits Tom Sellect to a tee. The story is very good and the ending is just right. There are more DVD's in the Jesse Stone collection and I would reccomend the whole bunch. All the stories run along together and all the actors fit the stories. It is for all mystery readers and also ones that like a neat ending. There are not so bloody and over sexed. It has just the right amount in each story.
2,"Uh oh, Jesse's lost some mojo.","John Updike famously said, ""Ted Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill."" That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. Then came ""No Remorse"". It isn't terrible, but it's lost some of the appeal. Here's hoping Jesse gets his mojo back."
3,It's ok.,If you have been following the Jesse Stone Series of shows you will like it as it continues the story. I don't think it is nearly as good as the earlier movies.
5,Enjoying Tom Selleck,"Another Great Tom Selleck Movie.Jesse Stone once again is butting heads with Paradise city council and helping his friend, Captain Healy in Boston.Suitcase is now acting police chief of Paradise. Rose and Suitcase are the only two working at PPD.Captain Healy is still recovering from the injuries he sustained in ""Jesse Stone: Thin Ice"".Great series of movies. I can hardly wait to see more."
5,Movies better.,I just read two of the Jesse Stone novels after seeing the movies. The movies are much better. Tom Selleck adds a dimension to Jesse Stone that Robert Parker didn't. The other characters are also better.
5,Jesse Stone,We own all of the Jesse Stone movies. This is a nice series to follow and keep up with. Tom Selleck is great in them.
5,Jessie Stone series,"One of the more interesting movies in the series. Keeps you guessing with a ""who done it"" type of theme."
5,Jesse Stone TV series,My daughter and I love the Jesse Stone TV movies and are collecting the series.
2,Script Remorse!,"Just watched this DVD. I love Jesse Stone movies, but the script of this one was very lame. Every Jesse Stone characteristic and saying from all the other movies that had been established was brought up in this movie--and done so in a very obvious way. Sissy offers herself again to Jesse. Hasty's tie lights up. Jesse is drinking and everybody's concerned. Jen calls, and Jesse and she have the exact same conversation you've seen in all the other movies, etc., etc. Jesse goes to his shrink and they talk about drinking....again. The conversations in the first part of the movie are very mechanical. The last third of the movie flows much better. If you are a Jesse Stone fan as I am (I own all the other movies) I would encourage you to rent this one, but not purchase it. I'm not sure you can take this one twice!"
4,Jesse Sone No Remorse,"I love all the Jesse Stone movies and No Remorse does not disappoint. Tom Selleck delivered a stellar performance as always. But the movie is great, beyond Tom Selleck. Love the mystery, love the inter-relationships, love the settings"
1,Disappointed,"I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck in general, and have really enjoyed the Jesse Stone series. I have eagerly looked forward to each new installment, and was disappointed in this most recent episode, ""No Remorse.""It seemed to be Jesse Stone ""light,"" without the substance, angst, and depth that most of the previous episodes have displayed.The story and characters was not as developed, and the conclusion was abrupt and unsatisfying.I'll give the next epsisode a chance, if there is one, but now with a lingering hesitation that I'd not had before."
5,No Remorse,Love the Jesse Stone series. Received product quickly and overall was a pleasant transaction.
2,Not as good as the first five,"OK, you have to get it to complete the set, but this one left me a bit cold, and at $16.00, you want your money back (or at least half of it).This was an obvious try at weaning everyone off of Jesse Stone as there is no place to go from this point.I would wait for a price drop on this one."
4,No Remorse,"This is a continuance of the Jesse Stone books and movies -The story line is (Stone) has been relieved of his duties (temporary suspension) and finds himself helping another precinct as a consultant - it peeks his interest and he is very effective.While back at Paradise they have their own problem with solving recent liquor store robbery at the same store, with very short man power - as the City Council refuses to give in and let them hire another officer. Stone finds himself helping out both in a very unique style.... Worth watching. Enjoy the little bits of humor and relations with other characters...Watch and enjoy - but you should see the others prior to this first..."
3,disapointing,"I watched this movie on tv and was quite disappointed. It left you totally hanging at the end with no mention of an explaination or mention of another movie to finish this one. I bought it because I have all the Jesse Stones and wanted it for my collection. I do hope they continue the series, I would like some closure on this movie!"
1,Go back to the old way!,"The first four movies in this series were great. The music, the plots, everything about them.I don't know what changed, whether they quit following the books, changed producers, directors, writers or what, but the last two, including No Remorse, are far below in quality, characters, plot and music.Please go back to the writers, directors, producers, and music used in the first four movies in the series before you kill off this franchise.Order the first four in the series, they are 5 star all the way. Stay away from the last two."
1,Jesse Stone: No Remorse,"Since I have always enjoyed the Jesse Stone movies, I was looking forward to this one. What a letdown. The plot was weak and had no real ending. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,A little disappointing.,"I have seen these movies and I can't help but notice how much they diverge from the Late Dr. Parker's work. These movies have taken on an almost surreal element. In one, Suitcase Simpson gets shot and, it would seem, gains some form of precognition. And it gets more bizzare from there.If, in the first few movies based on the actual novels, the storylines had not been scrubbed, for the most part, this might have been an entertaining series. I just don't feel that the characters are true to what Robert Parker created."
4,Remorseless,Highly enjoyable Jesse Stone movie. Tom Selleck delivers a quality character in an engageing story. The movie is well worth the money spent.
3,"Don't mess with a good thing, Jesse","As an avid Jesse Stone/Tom Selleck fan I couldn't wait for the next- bigger than life- Tom Selleck portrayal of my hero. Tom is the perfect Jesse.......or was. The last two Jesse Stone installments lack the finesse and strength of the real deal. My family actually had a gathering in order to watch this movie..........no one was happy. Added to the muddy, confused plot is a cliff hanger ending which left us all shaking our heads and wondering why anyone would mess with the marvelous, clean stoytelling of Robert B. Parker.If you are purchasing this video based on the past movies be forewarned.........it is not the same. Tom Selleck is wonderful as Jesse but this Jesse is not Robert Parker's Jesse. Neither ""Thin Ice"" nor ""No Remorse"" have the pace, appeal or clarity of the previous Jesse Stone movies. I sincerely hope Tom and crew will do at least one more in honor of Robert B.Parker and pull it all together."
5,just another hit,"Love the whole series, love it. Tom Selleck is just a fantastic actor and he delivers time and again. you'll love it too!!"
3,It is recommended,not bad and is recommended. The pratical test software attached helps me to review important issue for study.
3,Lots of Destruction,Scene after scene of things being blown up! The characters were not well defined. I was disappointed. It was hard to follow since I hadn't seen the previous tapes.
1,Scam,"Buyer beware before ordering this! If you're a fan of Lillian Gish, D.W. Griffith and great films in professional high quality, you're getting none of the above with this scam, this absolute sham. Instead, you get the 1934 version with Colleen Moore. Why the seller doesn't present it as such (even the horrible packaging doesn't) is beyond me... I hope this product gets dropped immediately."
3,IMAGE EDITION!!!!!,"The low rating is for the DVD presentation, not the film. It's great to see a restored version that looks quite good, but the thoughtless and disrespectfull replacement of the opening studio and title segment and end title are enraging. It is probably due to the print given to UCLA by Sherman, but the orignal titles are on the low budget releases of this film. This release would be ok to listen to the commentary, but I would just as soon watch an old beat-up print for the originality. ""Another"" film that would have made for a perfect release ruined."
1,The Scarlett Letter (DVD),This movie was terrible and was purchased to assist my high school student while reading the book. The movie was not helpful for my student. I would not recommend this purchase EVER!The Scarlet Letter
2,Lame but better than Demi Moore,"I am going to disagree with the previous reviewer. Humor is completely inappropriate for The Scarlet Letter. Hawthorne's novel exuded unremitting gloom. I have not seen the silent version for many years but feel it was superior to this one if memory serves. This 1934 entry has perfectly dreadful acting from nearly everyone. Colleen Moore was an actress who did not transition well to talkies. Her style of acting is all too similar to a silent movie performance. It is overly emotional. She does not deliver lines well either. I use this film version in my English classroom because it at least sticks to the main story line of the novel. Another reviewer on this site regrets the omission of the courtship scenes displayed in the silent version. No such scenes occur in the novel, which begins with Hester's punishment as does this film."
4,"Second only to Snoop Doggy Dogg's ""Doggy Style""!","Listen up, all you rap wannabes: I'm talking to No Limit, Cash Money, Bad Boy, and all the rest of the no-game rap artists out there who produce nothing but crap - take a lesson from Dr. Dre, whose flawless production, brilliant execution, and incredible musical ear make for one of the most listenable albums on the face of the planet. While the lyrical content is most certainly objectable, the phat beats, dope rhythms, and soul-grooving harmonies leave no room for improvement. Dre is on top of his game with this album, only to outdo himself on his next work, Snoop's ""Doggy Style."" Buy this album!"
1,This cd bites.,"This one of the worst albums& rappers ever, He's a way better producer than rapper ayways, he has no skills. This from a true Eazy E fan, and i hated it when he dissed him like that I'm glad Eazy struck back. Eazy E forever!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Dre is a no talent rapper, who is all talk","This cd would be pretty phat if there was no Dre. Day. The only reason Dre made that song was becuz he was jealous of the E.Get Its On ""Dr. Dre 187um Killa"" by Eazy- E, THAT CD IS DA BOMB. RIP Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright"
1,Don't waste ya $,"The stupidest rap album.So i ""fu**ed wit dre day"" and watcha gonna do?Eazy-e iz the phattest rapper ever.Go buy his cd, it called It's on [dr.dre] 187um killa. R.I.P Eric Wright 11523"
2,chronic sucks!!!!!!! eazy-e rules!!!!!!!!,one. i can't believe dr.dre had some good lyrics and sound effects but some beats suck.
5,HIS BEST SOLO ALBUM.,"This is old school rap at its best.Some really great beats and alot of classic songs here.This is dr dre before he sold out and signed those two clowns known as eminem and 50 cent to his label.Those two losers would be shoveling horse manure if it wasnt for dre.To conclude,old school rap is pretty good and hip hop sucks."
2,Album was in terrible condition,"Described as new, but upon arrival both vinyls in the album has chips along the edge. Very unprofessional. Never ordering vinyls from Amazon again."
5,EAZY,"THIS ONES A CLASSIC, NO DOUBT A BOUT IT BOUT IT, BUT EAZY E WAS THE MAN. DRE SHOULD PRODUCE MORE THAN RAP. RIP TO BIG PUN, EAZY E, FREAKY TAH"
5,ONE OF THE BEST RAP ALBUMS EVER,"This album is awesome. It has four of Dr.Dre's hit singles including ""Let Me Ride"", ""F**k Wit' Dre Day"", ""Nuttin' But A G Thang"" & ""Lil' Ghetto Boy"". None of the songs are boring or lame. Every track is a banger. If u don't have it, get it A.S.A.P."
5,best solo album by any member of N.W.A ( Tha Shiznit),This album was released in 1992 under Dr Dre's newly formed record label called Death Row Records. This was Dre's first album since his albums with N.W.A and in my opinion Dre is the most talented rapper ever not just for his lyrics but because he has the best producing talents of any one ever but of course 2pac and Eazy-E are better lyricaly. This album is packed with hits and I recommened that any one who is a true rap fan go out and buy this album. P.S F**k Ja Rule. Westside 4 eva mutha f**ka.
5,str8 gangsta classik,this alBum is tha Best of tha Best i like this alBum lotsan all tha trakz i like not one songz is not rite they all arethis is tha Best alBumz that kame out tha 90's
5,IT'S THE D.R.E.,"A Classic album. It is one of the best Debut album Of All Time, AND ONE OF The Best DEATH ROW Albums. Snoop Dogg & Lady Of Rage are guests On This album ALOT"
3,Good when I got used to it.,"I was used to the style of newer rap, and it took a while to get into this album, but when I did, I realized how catchy it was. In fact, I'm listening to it right now"
4,BRLLIANT GANGSTER RAP ALBUM,"ALthough many may argue that Dre isn't the greatest rapper, my opinion is that he has a great presence on the mic. He can also bust some great lyrics even though he hasn't written all hi own lyrics over the years. Subject matter is limited but it's meant to be like that. Dre is rapping about gangster topics. Snoop is at his best here and RBX is just brilliant. However the outro and the bonus track suck and shoul've been left off the album. The standout tracks are Stranded On Death Row, Lil' Ghetto boy, Let Me Ride, F Wid Dre Day, Deez Nuts, Lyrical Gangbang and High Powered. If you're into gangster rap this is recommended."
4,DR. DRE HAS BEEN MADE EVEN BETTER !,"The Chronic is Dr.Dre's first and most popular album. This edition has had all of the songs remastered so it sounds even better. But don't worry, none of the songs have been altered even though it has been remastered. A MUST 4 DRE FANS !"
1,my cousin hates this cd,my cousin gave me this cd to trade in. dre has the warped up beats. this cd got the rainbow sound. my cousin can't see that. i'm not trading it in because it is too much of a good cd. my cousin should understand that.
1,What a load of rubbish!!!!!!!!!!!,"oh my god!!!! i listened to these reviewers and bought it, too my disgust it was so awful it made me go back to the shop and try and get a refund!!! HOW CAN ANYBODY SAY THIS ALBUM IS GOOD?? if you want a decent album of Dre's, then buy 2001, tis much better!! AND WHILE IM HERE, TUPACS GREATEST HITS ALBUM IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER, NOT THIS PILE OF HORSE S###TUPAC IS GOD"
1,STUDIO GANGSTER at best.. check out Drake or Lil Wayne for good rap.,"Wuz up fellaz?? you know, I hate hearing people talk about how Lil Wayne and Drake aren't good rappers and how I should check out Dr Dre's ""The Chornic""... oh boy! I couldn't get passed the 4th track without turning this off! The beats are wack... the lyrics don't make any sense... and they don't rap about ex girlfriends or rims!! True rappers like Lil Wayne write good lyrics and dope beats! I can't believe this guy is even popular... what has Dr Dre and Snoop done for the rap game? NOTHING!For good rap listen to Fred Durst, Kid Rock, LIL Wayne, and Drake."
4,The Chronic,"The Chronic (intro)Dre Day 8/10,Let Me Ride 8/10The Day The... Took Over 8/10Nuthin' But A G thang 7/10Deeez... 9/10Lil Ghetto Boy 8/10A... Witta Gun 7/10Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat 8/10The $20 Sac Pyramid (skit)Lyrical Gangbang 7/10High Powered 7/10The Doctors Office (skit)Stranded On Death Row 7/10The Roach (The Chronic Outro) 6/10... Aint... 10/10"
4,The beginning,"The album that single-handedly knocked the doors down for the g funk era. Perhaps the best sampling by any artist showcases the prodcuer that dre would become. The album itself is classic with songs that epitimized street life like ""f###ck with dre day"", and ""the day the n*****as took over."" this highlights the album but it does have maybe one or two weak spots where the music drags due to the elongated prequel intros. It is a shame that Dre coulnt have done more than he did. The chronic 2001 was a good lp but his talent could have gone far beyond than just producing bad artists like eminem. A classic album such as this is more than worth the money I paid."
4,Good Album,"I'd like to say a few things, yes this is a great album and it is a highly recommended album for both the new and old fans of hip-hop. But let me make one thing clear....DRE DID NOT WRITE MOST OF THE TRACKS!!!!!! Yes thats right, he had A LOT help. He had The D.O.C. as a cowriter and MF Grimm as a Ghostwriter. Now with two great lyricists like that, and Dre's fantastic production, how can you not have a classic album? Another thing that I find very interesting is that how can a rapper that said this in one of his previous songs ""I dont smoke weed or a sess. Cause its known to give a brother brain damage."" (from:Express Yourself) make a album named THE CHRONIC (a high grade of Cannabis)??? That to me makes NO SENSE! But hey what can I say it's a great album, buy it, but by no means claim that Dre is one of the best rappers."
2,I find this a waste of money,"(NOTE : 2008 Update on review) Just likeDoggystyle Dual Disc, I find this Dual Disc re-release to be a complete waste of money. I feel That The DVD side was lacking when it came to the videos. I would think that the videos would have the explicit song dubbed over. And I thought that they would add some remixes album's singles. Not only that but just likeDoggystyle Dual Disc, the digi pack packaging falls apart way too easily and the videos appear on the later released15 Years on Death Rowwhich is a better set to buy. So if you have the original, don't bother upgrading. It would so be a waste of money if you ask me. This is a cheap re-issue."
5,the best hip hop album ever made,"Dr. dre is an excellent producer and talented rapper. He uses his dawgs to help out on his trax and it wurks out marvelously. This is the BEST RAP/HIPHOP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME. Every song is a 5 star one. buy this cd, it is excellent. It shocks me how good an album could be"
2,Nope!,OK Dr. Dre was and is one of the top in rap game but this album sucks! Do not buy it if u want to save ur money! Only buy it if u r a hardcore dre fan (UNLIKE ME)
2,DIS CD IS TERRIBLE,"i jus recently bought dis cd and i think its terrible, its jus got no quality beats to it, i only like 2 tracks on tha chronic cd, i am dissapointed in this cd, a major reason why i bout this cd is because ppl on this website said it was great i took ur peeps word and wasted my money on it. if u like rap and hip hop on tha radio 2day, then i dought u will like dis cd. dont buy it its a waste of money. im a major 2pac fan and i wanted to buy a cd that wasent related to 2pac cause thats like tha only cd's i get/ so i tryed to increase my cd collection with this cd and ill see now if i can sell it and if i get lucky ill get 5 bucks fo it"
3,The end of rap as we know it,"This cd marked the end of rap. It introduced Snoop Dogg, who had talent but choose to waste it on crappy commericals, movies, and tv. Dre then goes and introduces Eminem to the world, and it forever ruins rap. It made rap a joke and ever song to every come out that people gobble up was basically a thought from this album. I dont know if he did it because he couldnt get his career on track or he needed money really bad, but it was the lowest point in rap to me. I respect Dre but I will never acknowledge him as a king in rap, that honor will go to the RZA. He didnt waste his talent on crappy white boys and he has always been sharp, unlike Dre. RZA is the king of rap, not Dre."
4,This Cd Has 2 of the best songs ever recorded by Death row,This Is A baddass Cd By David Chavez VIVA LA NOria Hell Yeah MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO!
4,"Ah, memories...","I've never been a huge fan of rap, but I will admit to liking The Chronic. Rap hasn't sounded as good since (except for 2pac). There's an almost nihilistic quality about it... something lacking from today's generic, pre-packaged fluff. Plus the sampling is pleasing to the ear."
4,WHAT A GREAT CD,"Dr.Dre's first solo album is a sucess. His rythms and tunes, are so interesting to listen to and I always play his CD. Unlkike other, CDs, his does not get boring, and it is a real vacation to listen to him. One thing I love about Dr.Dre, is his variaty of different artists in his album. It makes the album that much better. It gives a different flavor of styles, and it gives other artists the time to shine. This album was great, and is a classic in the world of hip-hop. You have to have this album to be a true rap fan."
3,IT was good but not great,This is my boy DRE yeah u know him from CALI LUV wit Tupac He comes out wit dis and l gots it on tape instead of CD but its great it is a great album. He did some good stuff with his openin 3 songs but he sorta tailed off in the last portion of it he mixed some greatness in with his song Bitches ain shit its a great single l love it anwayz this is a for sure buy I reccomend it to e'body
3,"there are some classic tracks, but this is super overrated","don't get me wrong, there is some AWESOME stuff on here, but there's a bunch of trash on here too. this is one of those things that so many people like that others might feel afraid to say they're not super into it. ""let me ride"" still has, no questions asked, the best hip hop beat ever made."
3,3 times dope,It was really all about Snoop cuz Dre can't really flow. The lyrics are good and all that but delivery is weak. Snoop on the other hand can say anything and it will sound good. The beats are decent and sample usage are on point.
4,Clean Dre,"This is the clean version of the classic Dr Dre album The Chronic that you can get at Wal Mart. The only songs I really like on it are Dre Day and Nothin but a G Thing, but if played straight through is just as good as those 2 singles. Sug Knight is still in jail on death row right now."
5,priceless,"These recordings are beautiful gems, taking as back to our roots and remembering that out culture is indeed a beautifully diverse melting pot.As always, one can expect A-1 quality on these recordings, as is true from practically everything Alan Lomax made.Listening to these tracks will better tell the tales and the review better than I can. Any lover of American roots music will be enthralled by this disc and the rest of the collection that goes with it."
3,Camera is good.. but pictures are not,"The camera might be worth the price and has lot of features. But I was not happy with the shots taken in the night with flash. Its fuzzy. The daylight photos are fine. But the night shots taken with light and flash, doesnt have clear pixel. It should have given better picture for the 6 MP. I earlier had a 4 MP Canon which used to give better pictures. I returned this product back."
4,Great value...,"I bought 2 Olympus cameras for Christmas, the FE-180 for my in-laws, and the red Stylus 750 (Oh so stylish). I paid twice as much for the 750, but on Christmas morning when we were trying out our new cameras, they took to a novice point and shoot user the same photos. If anything the FE-180 was easier to start using had the same shooting guides as the more expensive model, and the convience of AA batteries that are easier to find if you forget to charge the Lithium one on the 750. It doesn't have as many manual settings, but for my in-laws first digital camera, it has worked out perfect."
2,Fuzzy pictures,"The FE-180 seams to have a major problem with the picture quality in this camera. A review at CNET says the pictures are soften but that's a politely way to say fuzzy. I took over 100 pictures indoor, outdoor close up far off and in some shots the pictures are clear but non of them are sharp.I got a lot of out of focus shots and tried using the digital stabilizer mode called DIS which is really effective in low light scenarios. But I could never get a sharp picture.Another issue I have is that after you take a picture it only stays in the display for about 1 second. If I want to view the picture I have to switch to the viewing mode, making sure my subjects were looking at me. I returned it getting the Canon Powershot SD600 which works perfect; it's worth the extra cost to take pictures that last a lifetime."
2,NOTHING NEW,"I BOUGHT THIS THINKING IT WAS THE MOVIE RAW FOR 30 DAYS, SORTA A REVIRSE OF THE MOVIE SUPER SIZE ME WHICH WAS FANTASTIC. I WATCHED THIS AND IT WAS SEVERAL WELL KNOWN PEOPLE TELLING YOU ABOUT GOING RAW, I HAVE READ SEVERAL BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT AND THIS DVD HAD NOTHING NEW IN IT. I WOULD SAVE MY MONEY $29 AND GO ON LINE OR YOU TUBE AND PULL UP DAVID WOLF, YOU TUBE HAS DOZENS OF RAW INFORMATION"
5,I knew nothing,"All these cooking shows on TV, they really are nice, but cooking food really destroys the nutritional value of the food I've been eating all my life. The process of packaging food destroys the food I've been eating also. For decades I have been filling the VOID (my stomach) but I have not been eating nutricious food. WE ALL can benifit emensely if we shop at farmers markets or grow our own food. It is a bit more expensive, but so is medical care and treatment for having a bad diet."
5,RAW FOR LIFE:THE ULTIMATE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF RAW FOOD LIFESTYLE- DVD SET OF 2 DISKS,"I have Diabetes Type 2, and I am currently swinging accross to vegetarian diet, so it is very appropriate for me"
2,Not moving,This is okay. If you want to hear people talk. Is it great!!! Not at all. it is a lot of interviews with 6 different Celebrity & Expert interviews.
4,"good raw food info, but not WOW","It was good, not great. Had some good info, but not nearly proportionate to the cost. Has some really good points of view, and information, and interviews."
5,Please reprint this series!!!!,I've had a hard time finding these books in good condition. To the publishers out there please reprint the flashing swords anthologies! Hardcover would be preferred!
4,Needs better examples,"Best book I've seen on the subject of POSIX thread programming. My only criticism is that the examples are lame. They excercise the API calls described in the preceeding text without adding any helpful context, insight, or details.The author would have done better to provide one or two fairly complex case studies as examples, with analysis of their design process and tradeoffs. Instead there are small examples of every little detail of the API, that they add nothing of value to the book.That criticism aside, it is a well-written, useful book, which I highly recommend."
2,Interesting...,"I really enjoyed part one of this collection, but part two spirals off into insanity. I couldn't finish it."
1,Dry and boring -- no emotion and the main character was robotic,"I'm still trying to figure out how this book got 5 stars; it was so drab. The main character just had no feeling, no emotion... she was incredibly robotic. It all seemed thrown together. The only thing that made me finish it was the hopes that maybe something great would eventually happen; it had to have something to earn those 5 stars that all the other reviews left, right? I was so disappointed in this book. For anyone else who felt this way, go read Charlaine Harris (Sookie and the Grave Sight books are phenominal and blow Pike's book out of the water), or Patricia Briggs -- pure entertainment."
1,Hated it,"I'm still trying to figure out how this book got 5 stars; it was so drab. The main character just had no feeling, no emotion... she was incredibly robotic. It all seemed thrown together.

I was so disappointed in this book. For anyone else who felt this way, go read Charlaine Harris (Sookie and the Grave Sight books are phenominal and blow Pike's book out of the water), or Patricia Briggs -- pure entertainment.I personally think Alisa is a hypocrite, bragging about beautiful she is and how many men fall for her."
5,Best Book Ever!!,"A 5,000 year old vampire thinks she's the last of her kind. One night she finds that a detective had found out her bloddy secret and kills him with out knowing how much he knew. Now she must become a high school student to befreind the detective's son. Falling in love with the young boy, her past will come to hunt her and her actions will change history"
4,my review??,"this was a totally good book, im a huge Pike fan. it starts of good and ends better. its a good start to the series, i think it could live with out as much gore, but thats what PIke does i suppose... if you dont mind crudity, (hope this is a word lol)or gore, this book would be good. if you like this, check his others."
5,Survival..,"This is probably the greatest book I've ever read.Pike does a good job of making the storys into both past and present times, also Pike knows what his reader wants to read, The Last Vampire is at least a 5 Star book and I recommend this book to all fans of Horror."
5,Truly a collection of his best works.,I do not see how anyone could rate this book any lower than a 5 star. Such compelling writing. I truly was moved. The way he lead you on with Sita's daughter Kalika. The surprises around every corner. And the ending. Oh book six was so moving. My I have to say that a good book you can't put down. But the best book MAKES you put it down because it is soo good you can't go on for a bit. You have to stop and consider or reread what has happened. He could not have come up with a better ending. The epiloge was a great way to end it with Seymour. You have simply got to read his whole series. The whole shabang of things. From The Last Vampire to The Last Vampire 6: Creatures of Forever. You will never regret reading such a book. My compliments to Christopher Pike. As I young writer you are such an inspiration and I truly could not compare to your work. Read the first collector's edition and then read this one. You won't regret it.
5,Great Book!!!,"This book is so good. I mean it is sexy, fun, and a page turner. Sita is a great character (although Sheila from Remember Me is my fav)! Still this is a must read. I can't wait to read the sequal."
3,A Decent Read With An Ego,"Reading this book in the 6th grade left me awed. Reading it now leaves me bored. The highlights of ""The Last Vampire"" are when Alisa dips into her past and tells of her family and life as both a human and a vampire. However, the present day (which most of the book is) is one long ego trip. Alisa continually goes on about how great she looks, how cool she is, her unique abilities, her power to seduce, and drags on about this. It is very annoying. I would have to recommend not getting this book unless you like narcisstic vampires and can't afford sleeping pills."
2,Let down,"I got really into Volume One in middle school and recently reread the first one again, liked it again and decided to buy the second. Whereas the condition of the book was great the quality of the story in the second volume was a big letdown. It was slightly hodgepodge and confusing. It's too bad because I really enjoyed the first volume."
3,Interesting Vampire Story,"The Last Vampire is a good horror novel, but fails to draw you in completely. The main character, Alisa Perne, or Sita, is a stunning, petite blonde who has lived as a wandering vampire for five thousand years. It gets tiring hearing her talk about how beautiful she is, and how she knows men love to look at her body. It is also tiring as she lists endless super-human traits she owns that make her invincible. Pike seems like he just couldn't stop listing abilities. His writing is flawed in places.What makes this story interesting is that Pike has removed the setting from Transylvania to a place no one associates with vampires - India. And he works in Krishna as a character. You know - the blue dude with the flute whom Hare Krishas worship.I will read the rest of the series, but Pike has failed in creating a heroine that readers can relate to and root for. I get tired of all the men eating out of her hand."
5,Excellent! Awe-Inspiring! Brilliant!,"This is by far the most brilliant book I have ever read. Knowing that vampires are not what they are, like most books tell made me impress with this book. I'm disgusted with the lie that vampires have something in common with coffins, crucifix, garlic.. etc. Most of that I belive is not true. Anne Rice's bores me, Bram Stoker's disgust me. A very good start with a very impressive ending. Magnificent plot. Intriuging facts!Highly Recommended!"
4,very comfortable,"This is a great pillow, very comfortable, especially for people who sleep on their stomachs - as i do - it's not too thick or too thin - and i have had no allergy problems since switching to this pillow!"
3,Not a favorite,"I have ordered many CD's of gospel music, and while there's some good songs on this, I would say the quality of sound is not what I expected. A little disappointing."
1,have not received this product,I have not received this product after over a month or ordering - please investigate. I do not know from whom this was ordered.
3,Love this bright shade of yellow!,"I found that the plates were in great condition. However, I wondered why the lines were not as defined as they were in my Fiesta dishes that I already have. Could this be a second? The color matched my dishes and I found no problem with the size."
1,Dimensions are different,Beware...the dimensions of this item are not 12 inches as stated. It is actually 10 1/2 inches. I was told that the 12 inch plates are no longer available from the manufacturer.
3,"Slow, plodding, shines at times","I enjoyed much of this novel, but I have not been swayed either in finishing the book or by the lofty reviews that this is a great book. It's a good book -- it's solid, but not spectacular. Tilman is a fine character, a young man who knows from a very young age that his role is not to live in one place, but to roam. His sister Klara absorbs the family's obsession with carving in his absence. She falls for the silent Irishman, Eamon, and watches him go off to war.Eventually a few of these characters make their way to Vimy to participate in the completion of the memorial -- an insufferable pilgrimage that to me does not work at all. I understand that Vimy is the crescendo of the novel, but to me it's an unlikely and uninteresting finale."
1,lack of info,Amazon should make it mandatory to list whether an audio is abridged or unabridged. How discouraging torealize that one has spent quite a lot of money for an abridged story. No one can write a review on parts ofa novel that someone else has edited. very disappointed
5,Should not be viewed with hatred,"DC 9/11-Time of crisis is not, as some have said, a propaganda film about the Bush presidency. It is a docudrama of the events and aftermath of the worst attack on America in history. Behind the scenes we see the strengths of this president and why he is and will continue to be strong. #1. Choosing talented and dedicated people to fill cabinet posts. #2. His ability to listen to them but in the end make the final decisions. And #3. His unabashed faith in God. When viewing this film bear in mind that it is history, not mere entertainment,education,not propaganda."
2,A funny piece of work.,"This movie is funny. I'm not even considering my political view in this.The actors look nothing like the people they try so desperately to portray. The actor does a better job on Comedy Central then here. But it's so comedic that I'm shocked they didn't sponser this. With the exception of the Con. Rice, the people don't act nothing like the real-life counterparts. When it's not funny, it's depressingly bad.I cannot give it one star, as I laughed too much. But I feel three is too much. So two stars it is."
1,Are you all serious?,"Many of these reviews tout Bush as a hero. I remember the week of 9/11, and I also remember Mr. Bush reading to elementary school kids in Florida instead of leaving while 9/11 proceeded. I also remember Mr. Bush hiding out in a secret bunker for a couple days until it was all clear. This is heroic???! Rudi Guiliani was MUCH more of a hero during this crisis than the president. Where is his docu-drama?! At least Mr. Guiliani stayed in NYC and tried to maintain order and keep the people calm. Why is it that we, in America, do not quite understand the definition of a hero. I would rather spend my hard-earned time watching Wonder Woman instead of this tripe. Now, SHE was a real hero!"
1,"""This is how we remember it. This is how it was.,""","The person that said that scares me. ""This is how it was""? Were you there? Because the people who made this film weren't. It's largely stuff said in meetings that nobody could possibly know about. And worst part is there is a scene faked where the media is involved. The scene where Bush is crying on the telephone. The media is there filming it. That never happened!And this Bush is just ridiculous! I WISH Timothy Bottoms was the president! He's a heck of a lot better than the real Bush! The Bush in this movie has plans. He has ideas. He has morals. He has a brain. He has a spine! All things the actual president is lacking.This is just a dumb movie."
3,Extremely well-made and quite riveting.,"Timothy Bottoms returns to the role of George Bush he originated on Comedy Central's ""That's My Bush!."" from the producers of South Park.This is no comedy though.I'm neither a republican nor a democrat and it's ashame that people view this film in a partisan manner, because that's not its purpose. This film was made by the same network that got so much heat for making the Ronald Reagan movie starring James Brolin. I might also point out that Showtime is far more liberal in it's programming (re: Queer as Folk, The L Word, etc) than HBO and it came to a shock to many people that they were even remotely involved.People should look beyond partisan politics and watch this riveting account of the days following September 11th. (...)"
1,...and you think bush tells lies...,"...for all the time they took to perfectly cast this film, you think they would have gotten some of the facts straight, as well...bush was not the hero that day, or any day since...have we forgotten that it was new york mayor rudy guiliani who held new york, and the country, together, while bumblebush was paralyzed with fear and cheney was locked away in his cell...after all, time magazine voted guiliani their man of the year, not 'w', and to consider this film anythng else but pure fiction is a disgrace to the memory of all those lost that day, as well as, all those true heroes who tries their best to help others survive..."
1,Died after 2 months of use,I bought this drive in September and it died already. Contacted Customer support and Seagate is sending another drive since there is a 5 year warranty. I'm just thankful my data was also backed up on another computer so no data has been lost - would have been much worse if my files had been lost.
2,Not Compatible with Mac OS X,"These are quite, affordable drives, but unfortunately, they are not compatible with the Mac as claimed! They do work, but only at USB 1.1 speeds. For some reason, the Mac will only recognize these drives at the slower USB 1.1 speeds, which means it would take 50 Hours to copy the content from the drive to another drive - totally worthless for any kind of archival purposes, which seems the main reason for these drives to exist.You can find work arounds for the 1.1 speed problem, but I've not been able to get my Mac to mount these drives at USB 2 speeds. Most unfortunate since I bought two of these units. So if you have a Mac, try another solution!"
3,Works good as a back up over USB 2.0,"Although this product states that it requires an ""USB connection"", you really need USB 2.0 connection. When I connected this drive to an older but still capable machine (3.0 GHz Intel single core / Windows XP) via USB 1.1 connection, I got a series of write cache / delayed write failure. After connecting the drive to a newer machine with USB 2.0 connection, the problem went away.Also, if you are planning on using this drive as another drive for every day use, you will be disappointed with the speed. It is good for backups and storing files / programs that are not frequently used. The real read / write speed even with the ample cache it boasts is not good enough for storing frequently used files."
5,Great Product and a Great Buy,"This was a great buy. The Seagate FreeAgent 500 GB is about the size of a book. Sits on my desk top and takes little space. I plugged it into a USB and it was ready to backup and save me in case of a Blue Screen of Death. I am happier with it than the big unit it replaced. The service and price were just great.Don't lose your files, pics and music the Seagate Free Agent 500 GB will save your butt. I would reccomend this item from this seller to any one"
4,Great Warranty,The product worked fine for about a month and then stopped. Fortunately the warranty information is stored online and lasts for 4-5 yrs. Just be sure to save the original packaging if the product becomes defective. This way you won't have to pay for more should the product become defective and you need to send it out. It has not been an unpleasant experience so only 4 stars. It would have been 3 but 5 yrs is a good deal on a warranty I didn't have to pay extra for.
3,"No Bells, No Whistles, No USB","500Gb for under $100 wasn't too bad a deal, but I am disappointed that this unit has no on/off button, no other buttons, and especially no additional usb connection. So bottom line is you get to use up another usb port, and with today's hardware demanding the usb ports, it causes me to have to buy a usb hub. it also has a light bar indicating read/write activity that spans the whole front side of the unit and is totally unnecessary, and sometimes distracting. And the light just pulses with no rapid or direct indication of the read/write. But with that said, I have had the unit a couple of weeks and so far so good. Let's see if it does better than the comparable WD My Books that crashed on me after less than 6 months. So bottom line, if you want 500Gb cheap this one should do."
1,"BE CAREFUL, THEY DIE EASILY!","Well at first it was awesome, with the amount of space it held, but be warned. Mines died after 1 year and well... let's say I had A LOT of priceless pictures of my family and the sort, and it all just went away. DO NOT flip the drive upside down, it will start clanking and boom you're doomed. Good Luck but I'll never buy another seagate."
2,"Too big and buky, poor design","I needed a removable hard drive to backup my data and then store off site. I bought this and theWestern Digital WDH1CS5000N 500GB My Book Home Edition External Hard DriveAfter using both for the last two weeks, I clearly prefer the Western Digital. It is, or was when I bought it, $20 more. However, it has firewire and can be daisy chained. A very nice advantage.The Seagate is a much taller drive and has that funky base. It seems more likely to topple over, although it hasn't. I can do without the slowing 'flashing' activity light bar on the front too.I'm not sure I'll go through the trouble to return it but I definitely recommend the Western Digital over this one."
2,'Data Mover' and backup software a trial version only,"I read the box over and over to make sure I understood what capabilities this drive had besides just being a large hard drive. The data syncronization, backup and versioning capabilities were the biggest selling points for me. The device was touted as a 'Data Mover' rather than a drive. I was very disappointed to find out that the software that does everything the box promises is a trial version. Plan to spend another $30 if you want any of those capabilities. It also seems cheap that an eSata cable is not included. Otherwise, the drive is quiet, looks cool with the lighting and does not get as hot as other reviews have indicated. The drive is good, but don't buy it for the Data Mover functions promised on the box. The advertising seems very misleading."
3,good and bad,"i purchased the hard drive to transfer programs from my dvr to hard drive. it seems to work fine, it has no on off button, so that when it does not work, i have to unplug unit and replug it and then it works. for the price i think its a great deal"
1,Die in one day... I would rate 0 if possible,"Got this last week, plugged in and used it last night, and then started to trasfer my files to it. After finishing transferring all my data to the device, it died... Tried troubleshoot for three hours, tried it on two of my computers, both could not detect the hard drive, and off course, no way for me to get my data back... I would never ever by Seagate's product anymore. Painful experience..."
1,The worse piece of hardware I have ever purchased,"Not only is it the worst piece of hardware I have ever purchased but the software is worse than the drive.My computer refuses to restart or load OS when the drive is connected via USB. I connect it as a second back up for data, pictures and videos via drag and drop then use the 'safely remove hardware' app to remove it when I am done. I only load a couple of gigabytes or so at a time so it won't overheat. The rest of the time it just sits there useless.I've had a Western Digital My Book for 3 years and have not had one problem with it but it was starting to fill up so when I saw this drive on close-out for $40 I jumped on it. I trusted Seagate to sell a quality product, was I ever wrong. I don't know how this piece of junk ever made it on the market."
1,Not a good product,Our 500GB Seagate failed in less than a year. We had to have a professional data retriever grab what was saved on the drive. To our expense of course. I wouldn't recommend this brand to anyone until they increase the quality.
3,Seagate 500G USB External Drive,"Drive works great, however the SW does not support Mac and the big thing was that it's not firewire. USB2 is OK but I would have preferred firewire. The discount price from Amazon however made it an excellent bargain!"
1,I lost over 7 years of data...,"I didn't knew that with a little fall over the table...obiously an accident i had, the drive just refuse to work, stopped working, cant be recognized anymore, emits a low buzzing and beeps every once in awhile....with all my data inside with no chance to return it to my pc, about 7 years of data. Then i just fell in anger and destroyed the drive...i think not even 10.000 years of warranty can cover that....BTW, no more seagate products in the future, at least not the freeagent."
4,Good stuff,"As a lot of peaple said, the capacity is only 465GB, because they count 1000000 Kb = 1 Gb. Is a lilte bit big because of the base. Excelent waranty and good product."
4,Great Product,"Great hard drive. Really quite and super fast. I originally bought a 250gb and wanted to save it as a backup so I ordered a 500gb my book. The mybook conked out in the first two days so I returned it and bought the seagate 500gb from Amazon. Needless to say, I should of just stuck to Seagate in the first place. Really guiet and dependable and great price. I recommend it to everyone. I use it to hold all my music while I DJ with Serato.Also, the warranty is great. I think like 4 or 5 years. Can't beat it.Great Buy!!!!"
2,Ok on the PC side / Terrible for Macs,"That's what this comes down to..USB 2.0 and the speed of this drive seems ok when used on a PC.However, when formated for the Mac, it is very, very, very slow.Frankly, the indicator lights are HORRIBLE!! and that is on either Mac or PC. You can't tell if the drive is writing files to the disk or not. Just a very poor overall design and performance.Look more toward Maxtor drives for better design and speed."
2,Drive worked fine until it died,"I had this drive hooked up to my MacBook and MacBook Pro, and never had a problem with backups using Apple Time Machine. Everything was seamless and in the background, just how I liked it. I never really accessed the files on there, but just liked the peace-of-mind that came with having a year of backups available (80gb of music, 20gb of photos, etc.).Fast-forward to recently, when Time Machine started giving me errors about backups. After trying to delete old backups to make room (I wasn't sure if that was the issue, but I tried) and reformatting, eventually the drive was no longer recognized by the computer. Using Disk Utlity to verify/repair disk, and also to completely reformat it were all exercises in futility. From what I can tell, the drive is completely dead, all backups gone. Luckily, I don't anticipate needing my old backups, and have all my important files on my computer, but if I had important files on the drive, I'd be pretty peeved."
2,Poor quality,"I have had this for less than a year and it has started making a noise and will not work anymore. The technical support pages offer no help; they merely say that it might be a problem. Really? I thought it was supposed to stop working...I would suggest if you really need a lot of storage for cheap you can look into this, but it is not trustworthy and rather than being a backup for your data, it ends up being the thing that needs to be backed up."
1,not reliable,"I bought this just a year ago on Black Friday Sale. I bought this just because it was a good price, big capacity, and good appearance. I regret that I didn't do research. After a year of use, I lent this to my friend along with my other externals. I plugged this into my computer and the computer did not recognize this just like the problem other reviewers faced. My friend might have tipped it over or used it too long that causes overheat. But my other 3 and 4 year-old externals were fine although they were treated the same way. totally junk.it does start spinning when i connect USB to a computer, but it stops spinning after 10 seconds and never get recognized by any computer I tested (XP, Vista, and Mac). So I opened the enclosure hoping that SATA HD is still fine, but unfortunately it was the HD that failed. It has a 5 year warranty, but why would I wanna have another piece of junk that I cannot trust? I will see if I can get any kind of refund instead of a junk replacement."
5,Works very well and feel comfortable to introduce to friends,Works quiet. Big space. Install super easy. 5 year warranty. Have been using it for nearly one month. Works very well for me.
3,"Love it, BUT...",Its great. It's fast. Its not PC/MAC compatible...you have to preformat it to one or the other... :(
1,Horrible,"This Seagate drive was truly a horrible experience. First there is very little information that is included with the drive. I was able to transfer 40 gbs of data to the drive. After shutting down my computer, I thought all was well. The next morning upon booting up, the computer no longer recognized the drive. I tried this on several other computers and nothing. I also noticed that the connections on the unit were very flimsy. Suffice to say I had to go in and remove the hard drive from the flimsy case. Also the hard drive housing brain malfunctioned...with all of my data on it. Horrible Horrible external hard drive. Stay away if at all possible if you care about your data."
2,Not so good...,"Well, I have always liked Seagate drives because they are the last ones with a five year warranty. Problem is, you are going to NEED that warranty with this type of drive, mine failed in four weeks. There is no cooling system, just passive air vents, so the controller board overheats and the drive starts failing to communicate with the computer properly. Once it fails completely, kiss your data good by as Seagate will ONLY ship you a refurbished drive. They offer to ""recover"" your data, meaning they will take the time to copy it off the old drive, at a very high price. If you open the unit to get your data out before you ship it to them you have voided your warranty... Next time I'll get a LeCie with a one year warranty and better history and track record... This was my last Seagate. Too bad, I liked them."
2,Well at least it's got 450GB of usable space,"I have two of these now and I can say that I do some what regret the purchase. I use these on both windows and Linux based machines with minimal problems. The one issue I've constantly run into with this disk is that it `automagically' goes into power save mode.This is very problematic on Linux based systems as linux detects the disk as having failed and marks it as read-only.The other downers about this drive are the fact that it still uses the 1980's style wallwort power supply, and it also uses the smaller USB connector (Which makes no sense).Speed:This disk does claim to be 7200RPM but I highly doubt you'll ever see any benefit to it.Comparing this against _MANY_ of my other disks, this is one of the slowest USB disks I own. I average anywhere from 3 to 10 megabytes a second transfer rates.Comparing that to 10 to 18 megabytes a second on just about every other flavor of USB disk I own."
1,Kaput Seagate,"Oh, to learn a lesson the hard way when buying an external hard drive like the one I had with this Seagate 500GB ""Free Agent"" external drive. At one time I had too much music on my computer and ran iTunes off of this drive after I had put everything I had on it. I also transferred RAW photos from a trip to Germany.What I found out was that it is a good idea to have a backup for my backup. I ran this thing for a month, treating it well, and all of a sudden it just stopped working. Music and photos gone in one second."
2,only goog for a year,"It worked fine for about a year, but after that it stop working and i lost all my files."
5,Great external hard disk,Just bought this hard disk a month back..Looks great for the price.. No probs so far.
1,pure TRASH!!!,"i think its a good idea to have at least 500gb to do your thing, but not at this expense. i purchased the drive and moved about 100 gb of music and movies. 10 hours later, everything was gone...i made a few calls to tech support, who seem to want to give me the run around instead of replacing the drive. they talked to me like i didnt know what i was doing. u can train a seal to use a plug and play drive. then he told me it must be my Mac. i dont think so brother. i have about five external drives and they all work well with my Mac.. then he asked me did i really put any files on the drive.....WHAT??????? those guys at seagate are clowns. save your money. im going to use my drive when i go to their headquarters and show them how much it cost to replace a window..."
1,"Ok on PCs, not so good on Macs","I have been attempting for some time to use this drive as a backup for my Mac. Ideally, one would like to drop large folders on it, containing, say, your photography archive. Unfortunately, the drive eventually times out and gives various errors. When this happens, I cannot umount the drive or to get DiskUtility to verify it. The drive basically can't be written to until I reboot. I have reformatted the drive for Mac HFS, twice now, yet the problem remains.Seagate support did not respond to my email.I am extremely disappointed with this drive."
5,"Great product, fair price","I bought this 500 GB external hard drive to back up my data, I've had it for a few months and all I can say is that I'm very happy with it. The write speeds are very fast, 500 GB is a lot and I say a fair amount for around $100. The build seems solid enough, although I'm sure there's external hard drives out there with a more solid, compact, space-efficient build with better materials, but this one will do. Very attractive case, I really like the orange light on the side. Powered by an outlet plug, so this is not for those who are looking for externals only powered by USB. I like the software it comes with, the sync features are very useful, good brand name, great product!!!"
4,good deal,"I got this for a good price and it performs well, without any sound.The only issue is its upright design, which at times creates problem for space."
5,"Fast, quiet, stylish, easy to use.","I own this drive for about two month (FreeAgent Desktop 750 Gb). It may not be long enough to say how reliable it is, but so far I had no problems.It has everything that I expected and more. It's fast, very quiet, stylish, very easy to use. It never gets overheated (like some reviews say about Pro version), although I use it quite heavily.My previous WD external drive I had to return, because it was very slow and prevented my PC from booting. Never had this problem with this drive.It took me some time to accept that this drive doesn't have On/Off button, but then I realized that I actually don't need it. It starts and shuts down automatucally with my PC, and this is OK with me.So in general - excellent drive for most people, although probably not for professional. But it's a Desktop version, not Pro."
5,"Great Price, Quiet and Fast","I'm using this drive for backups on my Windows Vista system and am very happy with it. It is very quiet, quite fast and was a great deal for the money. It was also easy to setup. I just plugged it in, it was immediately recognized and I was able to use Norton Ghost to backup my drive. Note that I can't speak about the FreeAgent software that came with it since I'm not using it."
5,This is an amazing Product,"I just can't ask more... a slim n sleek, stylish and fat capacity device... don't dream to have more than this... an absolutely stunning look and performance... this one should get no less than 5 stars"
2,Very Unstable Design,"This drive has a very poor, bulky, and unstable design. The pictured base does NOT come off and you are forced to stand it precariously on end, which is a big tipping hazard. And lo and behold, if tipped, of course it encounters mechanical hard drive failure which would cost $1000 for data recovery."
1,Not reliable at all. Please dont waste your money.,"I had this drive for 6 months and kept backing up data periodically. But the drive stopped working after 6 months and I had to format it entirely to make it work. I lost personal pics and a lot of stuff because of this drive.My recommendation is to never purchase it and if you already have it, don't use it to backup your data. You will be greatly disappointed.Update. Within a year it crashed and could not access the data at allVery unreliable"
1,Avoid This Product,"Please avoid this product. This past week, I dropped the drive about two feet ONTO A CARPET FLOOR as I was rearranging wires. Now it gives off a periodic beep and a constant hard-drive type hum, is not recognizeable by the PC at all, and is essentially dead. The problem is that I recently downloaded many, many GBs of irreplaceable data onto this drive. I suppose the mistake was mine to think I could count on such a simple product to be that reliable, but I guess the point is if you are planning to use this device to store data you can live without, by all means, go ahead. However, if like me, you would be virtually devestated at the loss of the data you might store on this, please avoid at all cost. I have no bone to pick with Seagate/Maxtor- I am just basically numb right now to think one tiny drop onto carpet would erase months of work in the blink of an eye. It's gone."
1,"Looks lovely, but dies after 8 months","Like other reviewers, this drive died on me. I didn't notice it getting hot, but one day it just quit. Multiple utilities on Windows XP and Mac OS X Leopard couldn't get the volume on the disk to mount; repairing was out of the question, since who wants to use an unreliable disk as a back-up?The case is cute enough. But, from the reviews, I just guess the thing doesn't work right. I have other backup drives that have lasted a lot longer"
1,Seagate disappointment,The Free Agent line of Seagate external hard drives are a big disappointment after having the previous Seagates that are PERFECT. The power adapters do not work and therefore you can't use the device. Tech support is done by foreign middle school students who are nice but don't know what they doing.
4,satisfied customer,"The devise has been working reliably for the past 2 months. The only drawback I see is that the included software does not work to backup remote files, but it is possible to work around this issue. Overall, good product, great price."
4,Not too shabby,"I read a few things about this drive before I bought it, but I also know the Seagate name, so I decided to take a chance. Even as a ""Used"" unit, it is functioning perfectly, even after being dropped TWICE (thanks, kids!).The only ""con"" I can think of at the moment is the fact that it DOES get a little warm, with the fan assembly being on the bottom, but periodic checks show that I still don't get enough heat to heat my coffee, so I guess I'm happy."
1,Not a quality product,"Boy, this driv sure liiked good on paper. Good price, good reviews, well-known name, etc. I wish that I did more research.To start off, the fact that in most cases this device can't back up photos is a known error. You usually receive a message that ""hidden file"" backup is not supported"", even though in many cases your photos aren't ""hidden files"". When you remove this property, they still can't be backed up automatically. Of course, you can do a Copy/Paste, but I purchased the item so I wouldn't have to do that. The device allows you to customize a script to specify what files you want to back up, and how often, but within an hour, the system loses the customization.All in all, a disappointing purchase. Returned it for credit in 3 days."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this hard drive to back up all my important pictures and videos. A year later, it doesn't work. Seagate sent me a new power cord, but unfortunately, that didn't fix the problem. Data recovery is not covered under the warranty. Goodbye memories!"
5,No problems with this drive,"I bought the FreeAgent about a year ago to back up data, photos, and music files on my new desktop. I haven't had any trace of a problem. It's been reliable and quiet for as long as I've had it. I've had no problem with the computer finding the drive or losing data. I'm looking to buy another one for the new desktop I just purchased."
1,WORST DRIVE IN THE WORLD !!!!!,"AFTER READING THE OTHER REVIEWERS TELL THEIR STORIES ON THIS AWFULL DRIVE, I MUST SAY THAT I HAVE LOST TWO DRIVES IN A WEEK.SAME PROBLEMS OF OVER HEATING. I TOOK ONE OF THE CASES APART AND PLUGED THE DRIVE IN A NEW CASE AND IT WORKS. SO I WAS LUCKY WITH THIS ONE. THE OTHER ONE I WAS NOT SO LUCKY IT WAS DEAD,I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW A COMPANY WOULD PUT SOMETHING SO AWFULL OUT ON THE MARKET. IT'S BEYOUND ME.TOO BAD AMAZON DOES NOT OFFER A O AS A RAITING BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS DRIVE DESERVES."
1,Dont get for a portable option,"I bought this so i could move back and forth between my desktop and laptop. After 4 months it tipped over onto the carpet beside me. Maybe a couple inch fall. Stopped working, cant be recognized emits a low buzzing and beeps every once in awhile. I called seagate yes they will send me a new one, If I send it back to them. But all my photos, GONE everything gone. Can i get it back. Sure if I want to pay $700.00-$3000.00 We dont have that kind of money. So I asked if I could go someplace cheaper to get it back, sure I can but my warranty will be void. So My complaint is why make something that is so unstable and can just knock over. I would never buy this again. Totally unrealiable if it knocks over you've lost everything. Maybe they should put that on the box."
1,"Twice bitten, twice shy","I have always in the past held Seagate products in high esteem. So when I needed a new hard drive to serve as a scratch disc for Photoshop, I purchased the 500gb FreeAgent USB drive. (The scratch disk if just used for temprary files - I wasn't actually storing any full-time data on the drive.) Within a month, it had completely died. I returned it and exchanged it for a new one. It completely dies within 10 days. First time, maybe a coincidence, but after two in a row have tanked... well, good thing it was only holding temp files, not anything important. Next time around, I'm certainly NOT going with the FreeAgent again!"
1,junk,"We purchased this hard drive for our son. He used it with his lap top. It was sitting on a coffee table when it was knocked over. A fall of about a foot. The hard drive motor froze. Seagate informed us it would cost $700 to $2200 to retrieve the information from the hard drive. ??? Yes, $700-$2200!!! Upon investigating a cheaper way to go, I found out this is an ongoing problem with Seagate products. Tips and falls will break the motor. This is the real world folks. Things fall over. If they can't make a product that lasts, buy something else. This site made me choose a star but I won't even give this product one star or Seagate's customer service. Nuf said..."
1,Drive won't stay on,"This drive goes right back to CompUSA, prepaid return. Extremely flakey. Stayed connected long enough for me to create a huge backup; now it flickers on and off, and every time it flickers on, the FreeAgent software wants to reinstall itself. I went to lunch, came back to find 16 copies of the install launcher running. Now I wonder if I can ever get the drive to stay on long enough to erase my backed-up data before I return the unit. Shame on Seagate for producing this piece of junk!"
2,my 2nd,so my 2nd drive has crapped out as well. Now if it gets detected at all the files are in the folders for about a half hour then they disappear totally.Suggestion: HP HD5000S Personal Media Drive 500 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive right here on amazon for 160$
1,Bad Practice,"I bought this product three months ago, it recently failed. None of my computers recognized it and there was absolutely no power going to it. They told me I just got a ""bad"" hard drive and that I would have to pay ~1,500$ for data recovery from them, even though they produced the product that failed. The also kept me on hold for 2 hours to get another external hard drive, which I never got."
3,Lasted a little over 3 years,"I bought two of these, for my wife's and my Macs. One has died after a little over 3 years. I suppose that's more-or-less reasonable life. They are both very quiet and work(ed) flawlessly in Time Machine mode. The one that died simply would not register, i.e., the computer could no longer see it. I tried a few things but without success.Second one seems to be doing fine. I'll try to update this if (when) it dies.I didn't lose any valuable data; everything is still on the computer and my wife and I backup to each others machine every so often. However, if you have valuable data, don't trust it to a single backup."
1,Lost all my data...,"This has been the worst product I've bought in a long time. I was using it to back up my extensive collection of photographs. I knew I should be backing up the pix in case something happened to the drive. As I'm backing up irreplaceable pictures, the drive starts making crazy noises. Next thing you know, the computer doesn't recognize the drive and I can't get at it at all. Have tried everything I could find or think of to save my data - to no avail. Have even busted the unit apart and reinstalled the drive in a new casing. Now it spins, but still can't get to the data. I haven't given up yet, but this stupid thing has cost me hours of my time and is holding my priceless data hostage. Do yourself a favor and buy something else. Also, don't wait to back up your data to a second media! Backing up sooner would have saved me a lot of heartache. (Unless the multiple backing up caused the problem...)"
4,"Small,quiet and easy","The smalll unit it is nice piece of equipment, quiet and solid. Based on the other experiences I think that it is ok to use as a back up disk. Get warm after 30 minutes, no hot.Easy installation and fast data transfer. I would like to see what happend after one year of use."
5,Perfect,"So far, this seems to do exactly what I'd like an external hard drive to do. I plug it in, it's instantly detected as a ""USB Mass Storage Device,"" and then I can use it like a regular hard drive. It doesn't require software, it's quick, and it's quiet. The only sound it makes seems to be a low-pitched humming, which is barely audible. It's only about the size of a TV dinner, and the upright design is excellent for conserving desk space. I can't think of anything more I could want in an external hard drive!"
5,External Hard Drive,"I found this hard drive to be extremely helpful for storing all my documents, back up data, and music. It has really freed up my computer, it was nearly full. The package arrived very quickly and was easy to setup. I am very happy. I definitely did not have buyer's remorse. The price was right. The great thing is that it works with both PC and Mac intermittently, because I have both systems. This is a true item of convenience; your not sure if you need, and when you get it, you wonder how you lived without it."
5,Seagate External Hard DriveWorks Great,"Works Great! Easy to hook up,Freed up lot of space on computer, now it runs faster!!"
1,dont buy,This is trash I dont know who rates this device as 5 stars I have had this drive for 3 years every year it has been sent back to seagate. not to mention the device disconnects if you are transferring more than 3GBs dont buy this
1,Horrible!,I bought this last year and i am having the same problem as many others are having. It overheats and stops working properly. Don't waste your money on this product. Do a Google search for Seagate Freeagent 500GB problems and you will see page after page of people with the same problem.
1,terrible drive,"i have three computers and this drive has had problems on all of them. if i leave it connected and restart, the drive does not show up on my computer. it seems to only be recognized when i plug it in one out of every 3-4 times. nothing but problems from day one with this drive. also does not shut itself off when not in use like western digital's mybook or the buffalo drivestation. i have several external drives and have never had this much problems till i got this hard drive. i would rate it with a zero but there is no option on amazon for that."
1,Bad Drive,"I purchased this drive for Time Machine. After about one week it would not ""awake"" from it's sleep mode. I can plug it in and the light comes on, pulses but will not mount on the computer. Have tried reboot, unplug & replug but nothing works. Worst part is that my financial data is on the drive and I hesitate to return it to Seagate for another. Can not recommend this drive to anyone and would not buy another!!!"
1,Don't Buy This Drive!,This piece of junk broke without warning just 3 months after purchase. Seagate will replace the drive but NOT the data lost due to breakage -- and the data is what's important! Would need clean room recovery at thousands of dollars to recover data. Save yourself the hassle and buy from a different company.
1,Seagate Exteranl Hard Drive...BAD,"I purchased this drive about 5 months ago and it crashed, tech support is almost useless and I found thousands and I mean thousands of other users experiencing the same problems. Drive wil not mount. I also own 2 more Maxtor external hard drives own by the Seagate company and they also have crashed within less than a year of using and they are also not detectable on my Mac OS operating system. If you buy one Good Luck!"
1,failed after 30 hours,"I only use this device for back-up and ITunes. Otherwise I leave it unplugged. It failed after an estimated 30 hours of use. And prior to that it was unstable. Symptoms which preceded complete melt-down included:1. When I shut down while the drive was plugged into the computer, the system would just sit there forever displaying the 'shutting down' screen until I disconnected the drive.2. ITunes would be extremely slow at times.3. ITunes would refuse to close or not to start up.If you experiences these, it's not your computer or ITunes that is failing, but the drive."
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"waste of money. bought this product last year and now it's not working anymore drive does not power anymore. Seagate sent us new power adaptor but it still doesnt work.Now all my files are gone and Seagate will charge us for data recovery!!! shoot!!!if you use this for ""backup"", make sure you have a backup of your backup files!!"
4,good for the price,"I payed 100 bucks for this one and works pretty well.pros:-usb and SATA conections-cool design-fast-touch sensitive on/offcons:-too bright, u'll want to turn off this baby after a while of extreme neon exposure.-in usb mode, everytime u turn it on, takes like 5 minutes to load the data.bottom line, it does its job and i recomend itt"
4,Reliable!,"No issues yet. Easy set up, ""plug and play"". Odd shape/stance, and bright orange light. But again, very reliable. Highly recommended!"
1,Skip the Seagate,"Had it for one week and it will no longer power on.Shame on me. I had 12GB of movies of my two kids crowding the SD cards of my mine and my wife's phones so I transferred the files off of the phones and onto this drive. I should have just burned the files.From what I can tell, the problem is a power issue. The drive simply stops powering on. I've tried using a new power adapter but, still, it's a no go. There's been some who have luck breaking open the base, pulling out the drive, and purchasing a new drive enclosure to access drive contents.There seem to be near about as many 1 star as 5 star reviews on this product and that's quite telling. Myself, I'll stay away from Seagate drives in the future.Best of luck."
1,not worth the money,"I bought this external hard drive to store my downloaded musics, videos and personal pictures. At the start the hard drive seems OK. However after a couple of weeks, it suddenly unaccessible! It has power but the computer cannot detect the hard drive. After several frantic call to the Saagate Customer Service no possible solution were offered. The hard drive is now served as a very expensive paper weight. Do waste Your Money...."
1,D-Link?? Should be D-STINK,"I am very disappointed in this unit, especially since they make such a great router. It has NEVER worked right despite all the tech support calls and e-mail I have made and sent. Don't waste your money. Get a high range 2.4 GHz antenna instead."
1,"does not work, even with other D-link products...","would not work with 624 D-link, even after several phone conversations and hours on the line with dlink technicians. the techs couldn't offer any solution beyond what was written in the instructions and worse, they clearly did not care whether it worked or not -- they could not wait to just tell me to ship it back to amazon where I bought it from so they could get off the phone... it was disgusting."
1,Not worth it,"I did not have the set up issues the other reviewers mentioned. In fact, I followed the instructions of one reviewer and my set up was smooth and simple. Problem was the PC I was trying to obtain better high speed access on did not pick up the extender any better than the DI-624 router."
1,Just go with a different company!!,"I had the worst time working with my D-Link wireless router. After talking on the phone with several different customer service representatives, I was told that I should purchase this 800AP to extend my wireless range. I went ahead and bought it. After hours trying to get this thing to work, I called the customer service number, and got some help. After working with them on the phone for a couple more hours, I was then told I did not need the range extender. I was very furious because I kept getting different answers.If you are thinking of improving your wireless router, just upgrade to Wireless G, from a different vendor!If you really want this range extender, let me know, Ill send you mine!"
1,Terrible product,"I tried to use this as an extender for a D-Link 624 router. It works fine for around a half hour, then loses the connection to the router, disabling the internet connection of all computers on the wireless network. Repeated hard resets and rerunning of the setup utility are required to get it to work for another half hour before it dies again. Updating the firmware had no effect, and I don't have time to mess with tech support, so I returned it to Amazon. Instead, I bought a Hawking HAI15S directional antenna for my D-Link router, which improved my signal significantly, obviating the need for this range extender. It's also much cheaper."
1,"Like it's sequil save your money, but",The sum total of the book is buy life insurance as a hedge on the Death Tax.
3,Could Have Been Better,"The book is filled with lots of good information. However, I found his efforts to be humorous and keep it light and breezy distracting. Also, his one size fits all recommendations, in the real world are sometimes, absolutely, the wrong approach. Estate planning is an area where competent experts can add real value. Hopefully unbiased experts in addition to the insurance agents he so admires."
4,"Well worth the price, humorous and light but real worth the read","This book is well worth the price. it is a very easy read. In fact, I would say it is humorous, and breezy....no small feat since , and that means something when many books in this area are like reading economic text books in University. This will help teach you how to keep Government away from your nest egg."
4,Little known retirement bombshells,"This book outlines what boomers (and others) should know about their retirement finances. Few know what the problems might be when they transfer or start accessing retirement money. Fewer still will bother to find out and even fewer will act on the information. What ""The Retirement Savings Time Bomb.."" discusses is how to prevent unneccessary taxable acts when accessing the money and even how to access funds early (before 59 1/2). Finally, he talks over reasons for converting a regular IRA to a Roth IRA if it makes economic sense and how to minimize taxation in the long run. If I have one critical comment about the book, I feel the information is directed toward individuals who have more retirement savings than I. Regardless, I still will benefit from the information provided."
4,A good retirement book,"I saw this first as a TV special on PBS and decided to order the book. Skimmed it once and got some good ideas. It is a book that needs to be studied and highlighted in places. I need to re read it to get the information more securely in my mind. Definitely recommend it to the person about to, or just retired."
3,ABBYY OCR software doesn't load on XP platform,Good quality printer at a great price. It is easy to setup and run. One problem I have with downloading the software is that the OCR portion did not and will not load because of a problem that it senses with the InstallWizard. The other problem is that it doesn't read a Word document as well as it should. The color on the printed copy was the wrong color with horizontal lines running through it.
1,The worst printer I have ever owned.,"This product is above and beyond the worst computer product i have ever owned. The paper feed is just plain idiotic, it pulls paper down crooked and so photocopies and print jobs are horrendous. You will waste more ink and paper waiting for this thing to properly feed. This product was a disaster, go with hp, cannon, or some other ESTABLISHED printer company. You get what you pay for with Lexmark... JUNK."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't often write reviews, but this product is so bad that I feel I have to warn people. We've owned this printer for about 2 years. We've had it completely replaced once and the new printer was plagued with the same problems as the first one. About 1/3 of the way into a printer cartridge, the black ink stops working. We've bought numerous printer cartridges, from different places and its always the same. LExmark replaced the printer once...we still have the same problems. I have spent COUNTLESS hours on the phone with LExmark ( I would hate to know how many hours) and they never come up with a solution. So, we always go out and buy another cartridge and it works fine for a while and then all of a sudden, no black ink. I literally HATE this printer. ITs been nothing but a headache. Please stay away from it."
5,eXitSource 2001,"We travel often during the year to NASCAR races and pull a 24ft trailer. The eXitSource is a MUST to find stores, gas stations, RV parts stores and ESPECIALLY where the to dump the bathroom and water tanks. There are many states where the dump stations are not provided so to find one ahead of time is important in the planning. We have used the Exit books for years and would not be without it."
5,eXit Source,"I had previously posted a review and provided incorrect information concerning the listing RV dump stations in the eXit Source, they are in fact listed in the Trailer Life Directory which is another must for any travelers with RV's. Trailer Life is great for looking for Camp Sites ahead of travelling."
2,Author Poorly Reflects Glory,"From the first page of this book it was obvious that the author had some deep-seated resentment of Pamela Churchill Harriman. Bedell-Smith seemed to seek out only those who did not like her. The author also contradicted her facts on more than one ocassion. The first one I noticed was about her father, she said he never leared to drive, two pages later she has him driving to deliver milk after the war. There are many other misstatements like this in the book.I also wonder why Pamela was so bad. Men have repeatedly reinvented themselves over the years and people think they are great. Pamela did what she had to do to get ahead and more power to her."
3,Interesting but disappointing!,"I finished this scintillating book with one BIG unanswered question - what did this woman have or what did this woman do- that attracted so many rich,powerful men! The author certainly spent a great deal of time researching the life of Pamela Harriman. The book at times reads like a chronicle of daily events, But it never answers the BIG question. Maybe there is no answer. Maybe Pamela Harriman's free spirit was what attracted her list of men.The one insight that the book did provide was the corrupting nature of money & contemporary politics. This part of the book made me angry & just reinforced my cynicism about politics in general. Maybe, for me, this was the redeeming feature of the book.But I still am left with my BIG unanswered question. Maybe someone out there can provide the answer for me. Review of REFLECTED GLORY by Sally Bedell Smit"
5,20th century female version of the vintage Machiavelli,I have not read such a good biography in a long time. Ms Bedell is neither enamored nor appalled with her subject (a sin that many biographers commit). Her well-researched book has a good balance between the broader historic narrative and the focused portrait of the controversial individual.
3,Good for What it Is,"This book is the type that I begin reading, and by the end am angry with myself for wasting the time.I purchased this book out of curiosity about Mrs. Harriman's life. Certainly the author dug up sufficient dirt on the subject to satisfy the most 'enquiring' minds.As with another reviewer, I am still mystified as to what so many famous men saw in this women. Not particularly attractive for most of her life, she apparently had a female magnetism that escapes the written page. No surprise, many women have had that ability. It doesn't read well for the male of the species, many of whom appeared as pawns to this woman's machinations.Ultimately this is a rather depressing book. Like others, Mrs. Harriman is in the end old, alone and a rather pitiful character. What a ride while it lasted, though!"
2,Too much information,This book was my book club's selection. I tired of Pamela Churchill's affairs early on and found the book read like a textbook. Two redeeming factors were the knowledge gained as to how the English lived during WW11 and the insight into so many of the impressive players at that time in history. Also it appeared to be well documented.
3,A secret agent on the trail of UFOs,"This books is an old spy novel from the James Bond era of the 60'swhich actually talks about UFOs in an intelligent way.Nobody believed the governments reports on them.Nobody does to this day...Here we have a Soviet plot designed to make America look bad inMexico of all places. With hippies all around andMexico being the drug smuggling capitol of the timestories of flying saucers just weren't getting a lot of playcompared to the Beatles Yellow Submarine.The Matt Helm series was turned into several movies in this era as well.Here we have him wondering around Mexico investigating phony -baloneyUFO stories with his latest girl friend.The ending is somewhat strange,but mostly not very idealistic.I kind of enjoyed the straight talk on UFOs in such an unexpectedplace."
4,Great value for this book,"This book is mostly a historical account as Seaside, the development in the panhandle of Florida, is being developed. It mostly shows photographs of the different houses built so both architects and designers can get an intimate view. It is a great book as a reference for building in the Florida vernacular..."
2,Disappointing,"I have an abiding interest in homes on the sea. I've ordered a batch of them. When I saw this book, I assumed that it was a book about a variety of seaside homes of varying architectural styles. I was disappointed to find that it was a book about a single community in Florida, most of the homes being done in an architecturally consistent style. If you're looking for a book of relatively contemporary homes in Florida, this might be of interest to you, as it's well done from that perspective. Otherwise, I'd look at the other available titles, many of which are quite beautifully done."
1,Eforcity Wall AC Travel Charger for Kyocera K612 Strobe / KX21 Switchback / Dorado KX13 / Candid KX16 / Xcursion KX160,This charger is horrible!!!!! I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!
1,bad deal,"My daughter has had this charger for approximately a month, and it has already broken. It seems cheap to me!"
5,"Excellent, concise, read it!","Though it is a very slim volume, Schrecks Compact History is well worth the read. If you have any interest in Church history, read this as a good beginning book. It is not too complicated, but is detailed enough to not be boring or condescending."
2,The Compact History of the Catholic Chuch,"For what I wanted, it was a bit too compact. It was well written and for someone what had a larger knowledge of history, it woud be fine."
3,the history of christan church,this book is aneye opener to all catholic fathful all over the world.inshort the best sofar.
2,The Compact History of the Catholic Church,"Too short and cursory to be either readable or informative -- a ""cliff note"" treatment of the Catholic Church written with a pro-Catholic bias that makes it read like Sunday School material."
1,A shameless fairy tale,"If you want to get an idea of the infernal institution that was the Catholic Church, read about the Abigensian Crusade where the Church massacred most of the inhabitants of the south of France. Read about the ""Holy"" Inquisition that burnt alive at the stake hundreds of thousands of ""heretics"". Read about the medieval popes. Read about Alexander VI; the most corrupt pope in the history of the Church. Read about Julius III who was involved in the worst homosexual scandal in the history of the papacy. Julius III picked up a 13 year old male prostitute off the street and made him a Cardinal. This book is not worth the penny that I paid for it."
5,Invaluable resource!!!!!!,"This book is a must-have for anyone concerned about the state of employment for people with disabilities in America. Professionals, families and persons with disabilities would benefit tremendously from buying this book. Griffin and Hammis illuminate a whole new approach to developing, running and sustaining self-employment initiatives and do so with a flare for excellent writing. From systems change, to funding and social security work incentives, this book can make it easier for an entire section of our population to work, earn and live the American dream. Buy it, you won't be sorry!!!"
5,Making Self-Employment Work for People With Disabilities,"Once again, Cary and Dave did an outstanding job of taking on the complex subject of self-employment and breaking it down to a level that readers can grasp and move forward toward self-employment opportunities for people with disabilities! You two are amazing!"
1,Unspeakably Bad,"I am not great at logic games, and after completing a general LSAT prep book I decided to buy a logic games book to really hone my skills. Unfortunately for me, I live in South America and quickly bought what seemed at first blush to be a decent prep book, online, and asked my friends to bring it down when they came to visit. This book is badly, carelessly put together, as other reviewers have amply shown. I don't have the time or option to get more prep material, so I just have to struggle through with the few more reliable practice logic games available elsewhere. What a disappointment.Shame on McGraw-Hill for billing something so error-laden as a beacon of hope to desperate LSAT-takers."
1,USELESS,"This is a waste of your money, but most importantly your precious prep time. I thought there was something wrong with me in the beginning, but after a series of wrong answer match and typos I knew it wasn't me. I don't really care about the money, but I really regret the precious time I spent on going through this book. I don't know why this book is still in the market...."
1,NEVER TRUST ANYTHING FROM McGRAW-HILL,"I have a few comments about this book.1. The book's cover says, ""McGraw-Hill... America's Leading Educational Publisher"". With the typos and errors in this book, no wonder America's educational system is so far behind even some 3rd world countries.2. The book's cover says, ""Curvebreakers. Created by students at Harvard Law School."" With the poor editorial quality that was applied to this book, if this is the standard of Harvard... (Laugh)... again, no wonder our educational system is so far behind.3. This book needs to be recalled because it dupes the public into believing that it is something that it isn't, i.e. a good LSAT preparation book. Believe me folks, it's only good to use as kindling for a barbeque or for your fireplace... DON""T BE FOOLED AND WASTE YOUR MONEY AS I WAS.M.W. PaulHeidelberg, Germany"
1,Stay away,There are a ton of typos in this book and the logic games are frustrating enough with no typos. It is not worth your money.
2,Helpfull but riddled with errors,"This books techniques are very helpfull for the logic games section. This book however, is so filled with typos and mistakes you can hardly trust any answer they give you!!!!!"
1,STAY AWAY,"This book is FULL of typos that render the book confusing and useless. Don't waste your time, or your money."
1,Read Reviews Before Purchasing,"I wish I would have read these helpful reviews. I just spent the last month using this so-called study guide. It is very poorly written with many errors, which have alreay been noted. The thing that upset me was the lack of explanation for the answers. Don't get suckered into buying this book. DOWN WITH MCGRAW HILL."
1,Atrocious,"Maybe they don't want you to do well on the LSAT, because if you did, despite encountering this book, and you became a lawyer, you would want to sue McGraw-Hill."
1,Appaling,"What the $%@! Are the people at McGraw-Hill trying to pull? How did this book get on the market? And just who wrote it... A deranged lunatic? A filthy sadist? A pack of dim-witted monkeys on acid?The book is littered with errors. I started finding them almost from page one. Typos I could care less about, but the answers they give to the sample questions are frequently wrong. It's so bad that when one of my answers matches the answer in the book, I worry that I have done the question wrong.My exam is coming up in a couple of weeks... I can still recover from this mistake, but I sure would like my time (and money) back from this catastrophic disaster."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.,"McGraw-Hill should be absolutely ASHAMED of this product. This book had so many errors, it was laughable. By mid-book it was clear that I had to be on guard for incorrect answers (yes, plural) on pretty much every single answer key (though the vast majority were typos). If I hadn't investigated typo answer choices, I would have been led to believe that tests had been completed accurately when answers were in fact wrong, or inaccurately when answers were in fact correct. (The answer key frequently listed ""B""s for ""A""s; ""C""s for ""B""s; even ""F""s instead of ""E""s when there are only answer choices A through E!) A total waste of time and money.Instead: Ace the LSAT-Logic Games (wonderful book)"
5,Los Tres Diamantes-Boleros Clasicos-Vol.6,"Mexico's romantic trio Los Tres Diamantes have been singing for over 4 decades. The unique sound of their leading guitar has never been equaled. Their golden voices have made them internationally famous and in 1950, they were signed by the Walt Disney studios to record the sung portions of the musical background of the spanish version of their western cartoon classic ""Pecos Bill"". During the 40's and 50's Los Tres Diamantes recorded in Mexico for the famed RCA Victor Mexicana, label. Perhaps their greatest recorded hit for this label was Gabriel Ruiz ""Usted"" in 1952. In this ""Orfeon"" label compilation, old favorite boleros like ""Besame Mucho"",""Solamente Una Vez"",""Quiza,Quiza,Quiza"", ""Jurame"",""Quiereme Mucho"",""No Puedo Ser Feliz"",""En Nosotros"", ""Buenas Noches Mi Amor"",""La Luna Dijo No"", and ""Un Mundo Raro"" can be heard like never before, in the captivating voices and style of my favorite mexican trio, ""Los Tres Diamantes""."
3,Hopeful - but ultimately disappointed,"I am a big fan of Mark Victor Hansen and have always been impressed with his results. This is a man who has built a publishing empire, and who is filled with ideas and new projects. I've enjoyed many of his other books and was hopeful about finally hearing an audio from him. Unfortunately I was disappointed with this effort. Although the audio book contains some inspiring thoughts and Hansen is certainly enthusisastic, I found his presentation somewhat disorganized, and there was no clear order or description of where this program was going. Mark Victor Hansen seemed to be speaking much of the time ""off of the cuff"" and the presentation frequently rambled before he returned to the point he was trying to make. I must say I was not very motivated. If success and self improvement is in your blood, this audio is worth a shot, but I would try the library before you invest."
1,not for everyone,I rented and listened to this audio disc at a tough time in life where I needed some inspiration.He delivers his message in such an overly enthusiastic tone that he came off like a salesman trying to convince you to join a pyramid scheme. I felt the book had some good advice like keeping a journal and being honest with yourself about your dreams but the delivery of the message distracted from the content. His enthusiasm for himself and his stories is not easy to listen to if you are experiencing troubled times. I was hoping for something more down to earth.
2,Didn't do much for me...,"I did not like this book. I realize that the loose-knit text is supposed to be carefree and playful, but I still have a problem with children's books that use bad grammar. (Sample text: ""Morning has hugs/Toasters have plugs... Spoons have beat/Hands have eat... Noses have blow/Feet have grow..."" ) I think that infants and babies are hard-wired to learn language, and we sell them short by writing books in so-called ""baby talk"": why not just make the extra effort to find a way to make the same point or evoke the same mood while also using good grammar? Also, this book just doesn't seem very inspired, more like something that was cranked out just to have a new book on the shelf. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,No Windows 7 driver,Can't get my new laptop to recognize a serial transcription pedal plugged into the USB via the Belkin because there is no Windows 7 driver. It's not mentioned on the CD that came with the cable. Nor is there a Windows 7 driver available on the Belkin site. Works fine on an old XP machine but that's not the one I bought the cable for since that pc also has serial. Windows 7 has been out a while so I wonder if Belkin even plans on creating drivers for that OS for its existing cables.
1,Junk,"Like most Belkin products, this is a piece of junk. The prod. description says it supports macs. Dont believe it. It doesnt. You find out after calling their tech support that is only support OLD Macs.And you cant return it if its been opened. What a ripoff!"
3,"""Works"" with Win 7","Microsoft and Belkin both state outright that this product (the F5U409) does NOT work with Win 7. Despite this, as some reviewers noted below, there is a driver on the Staples site -- seemingly for a different but related product -- that will work. ([...])Unlike some of the reviewers below, I don't think ""being functional"" is enough to command a 5-star rating, especially when used with Win 7. That's even more true at the ~$40 price point. Since Belkin's lack of support for win 7 seems to be deliberate (as evidenced by the other products with similar chipsets supporting it), I would strongly recommend finding a better product elsewhere for win 7, unless you're desperate like I was when I got it!I do have to give it credit for the one nice touch: status, read, and write LEDs. This can be very helpful when debugging connection issues, rather than being left to guess whether USB is flaking out, whether unprintable characters are being sent, etc."
1,Do not buy,Belkin's support for this product is nil. Not Windows 7 compatible and even XP has troubles uninstalling the drivers. Avoid this product!
1,Doesn't work with OSX 10.6.4,I was unable to get this product going with Mac OSX 10.6.4 (on a MacBook Pro 5.5) - I ended up using my old Linux laptop to get it working. (I use this for connecting to Solaris Sparc servers).I'm going to get the Keyspan (also on Amazon).
1,Random BSOD under XP,"Have had it for ~3 months and about 15% of the time when accessing the device under XP SP3, I get a BSOD. Eliminated rest of setup and narrowed it down to Belkin drivers, on two different laptops.I've had good service from Belkin in the past, this is the first junk & a waste of time for me from them.If you're serious about your task, consider a non-USB serial port solution. See:http://forums.lavag.org/USB-to-Serial-adapter-problem-t8778.html"
3,Doesn't work with Kernel Debugger,"Bought this so that I could run Windows Kernel Debug on my laptop. Was unable to get it to work well. It kinda/sorta worked but was really slow.Replaced it with a Tripp Lite Model U209-000-R and so far so good.So I don't want to say this is a poor device, it just didn't work for the maybe ""special"" case I have."
5,Excellent book for Toddlers,"My two little grandchildren love this book. Both were ""biters"" until I got this book for them and started reading it to them.Now in the rare incident where one bites the other, there is an immediate apology, with the saying I taught them. ""Teeth are not for biting, I'm sorry, and then there is a big hug. I don't even have to remind them and they are only 3 1/2 and 22 months."
5,helpful book for biters,"My 2 year old daughter started biting me (mommy), grammy and her teacher when she wanted attention. She loves books, so I thought I'd give this one a try. So far, it seems to really be helping. A few times the book says something like ""Biting hurts! Ouch!"". She likes to say ""Hurt, Ouch!"" as we read the book. Then the book gives a few suggestions for corrective behavior, including asking for a hug. When I see (or feel) her getting ready to bite, I've been able to correct her by using the phrases in the book and then asking her if she wants a hug instead. So far, she hasn't bitten me again!"
5,Helped Our Biting Problem,"My son was having a problem with biting in school. This book really helped him. He loved it, and we read it every day. Soon after the biting stopped. He still likes to read it."
5,"Cute book, message works!","My son had a real problem w/ biting, but after reading this book over and over, I really saw a reduction. It's a cute book, great pictures. Def would buy it!"
4,Consider Age Appropriateness,"My son (who is just under 2) likes this book. He will even use some of the phrases from it after he bites! I was hoping (although certainly didn't expect) that this would stop the biting by giving him a different way of hearing about biting. It didn't. So, while this is a good book, don't expect that this alone (or probably even this along with a bunch of other things) is going to stop biting altogether."
3,No Bite!,"I bought this book because we've had a run of biting at the daycare center I work at. I was hoping for more of a story for the kids to relate to, but I think it's helping. We try to read it every single day, but 9-12 two year olds are more interested in the doggie in the book then hearing the story. Everytime I read the line ""teeth are not for biting"" I have the kids say ""No bite!"" just to push the point. It's a good sized, sturdy book with large and simple pictures the kids enjoy."
5,great book,"My son, 28 months, loves this book and it has really helped us. He really likes to hear this book, reading it over and over again. And he seems to be able to relate to the phrase, ""ouch! biting hurts!"" It has given us good opportunities to discuss the problem and to discuss what else could be done instead of biting. We have been very pleased."
2,too wordy,"This is the only book on biting that actually attempts to talk about biting - which is great that they attempt to address it. The book starts off good, but after about the 2nd page, it gets too wordy and my daughter won't sit and read it. The concepts are great, but the delivery doesn't work for young toddlers."
