4,high school problems,the book was a good book it shows what high schools students go thorw in there life what there dealing with and it shows how should handle the problem and what happend if you dont handle it the right way problems get bad by not solving the problem and she showing you all ways find a way to solve a problem before something turns bad.
5,TOAT/lynda,This book made me cry because I could feel the pain that Andy was going through. I don't know what I would do if I loss my best friend.When I started reading this book I could not put the book down so that should tell you that I really liked this book.
5,wow. best book ever.,"hey there. my name is jojo, and i read this book in the 7th grade, and it is the most amazing book i have ever read in my life. This is the most emotional book i have ever read and i love love LOVE emotional novels, becuase it makes me realize how greatful i really am for the things i have. I have told my family, and some of my friends to read this book, and now im gonna tell you. please please please read this book!! its amazing. after i read it at school, i came home and told my parents thati was going to purchase this book no matter what happens. Saying that, my parents took me to barns and noble (heaven for me) and i bought tears of a tiger, took it home with me, and read it in an hour, and cried like a baby for about 30 minutes. This is my favorite book ever and im so glad i picked it to read in 7th grade,please read this book!!-jojo :D"
4,TEARS OF A TIGER,"TEARS of a TIGER is a sad book about a boy named Andy and how he goes through the death of a friend.The book is really sad and informative.The best part about the book is its conversational form.The beginning it's just a regular night at the game.After the game,the boys decide to go out for a couple beers Gerald didn't go because he thought he would get in trouble with his dad. Andy was driving when they ended up on the highway and crashed into a wall. Andy rolled out of the car and the rest of the guys managed to get out except for Robby,the boy in the passenger seat. He had his feet propped up on the dash and got his feet jammed in the window, making it impossible to get out. THIS BOOK IS A RELAY GOOD AND SAD BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL TEENS"
5,tears of a tiger,"The best way I can describe this book is with one word and that is interesting. What I liked about it is the way it caught my attention when they crashed. That part really got me more into the book. Their was also a part in the book that I didn,t like:when Andy left his brother. He killed himself, and when his parents split up. Tthere where two main characters I liked and those two people where Andy and Rob. The reason I like them is because they where best of friends and A ndy really loved Rob like a brother. I think it was hard for Andy to put it in his mind that Rob was gone and it was his fault ROB was dead. There where a few things i learned:drinking and driving really does kill; and if you do something harmful to yourself, or even kill yourself,other people will be hurt."
5,Tears of a Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger is aboutsome boys named Andy Jackson,Robbie Washington,Tyrone Mills,and B.J.Copper.They had just finished playing a basketball game.They won,So they went out and goy\t some beers.They were driving around,and all of them were drunk except B.J.Andy was driving, and Robbie was sitting in the front with his feet up om the dash board.They were weaving all over the place,and then they hit a walland everybody got out except Robbie.It was such a tragic loss to everybody.Everybody was getting over it except Andy.He was taking it bad .He could never get the guilt because he was the one that was driving.I am not going to tell you what happened at the end;it would ruin it for you.I would recommend this book for anybody who likes to read because it is one of the best books i have ever read."
4,Tears of a Tiger was a life like story about drinking a driv,This was a really good book. It tells you about what you might go through if you do the same thing as Andy. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that real people wouldn't talk with all that street jive. Overall the book was really good. The characters were life like. Also it is a good book for kids to relate to.
3,"great idea, mediocre delivery","I thought this book was put together in a really neat, original format. But I just couldn't get past the heavy-handed preaching and incredibly wooden dialogue. Kids don't talk like this and I felt it got in the way of the story."
5,Tears of a Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger is about a teenager named Andy. He was drinking and driving with three of his friends and they got into a car wreck. That is when Andy's life went down hill. Andy was left with all the guilt and pain that he would have to live with for the rest of his life.This book was spectacular. It is a very interesting book. It teaches you how to cope with things that you don't face everyday.I would recommend this book to any teenager that needs to know how bad drinking and driving is. Also, for anyone who enjoys poetry."
4,Teears of a Tiger,I think the book Tears of a Tiger is a very unexpecting book.See the book tells about four teenage boys who got into a car after thay had been driken and Andrew Jackson also know as Andy was driving at the time thay swerved off the road and killed the passenger Rob.Few the next few week Andy felt that it was his fault. Andy and his girlfriend broke up because she got tired of him.
5,tears of a tiger,"Tears of a tiger is a very realistic view of teenage life. It's about a 17 yearold boy that got into a car crash and he blames himself for killing his bestfriend. He turns away from his famillly,friends,and teachers. But at the end Andy just could not face life anymore so he just ..........well I cain't tell you that so read the book. I liked this book because of the news paper articles,notes,poems and conversations in the locker room,between the guys. I recommend this book for all ages because if you ae young then you will probably see what not to do if you get in that situation."
5,IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU,"Four friends celebrate a winning basketball game by drinking beer and wind up in a fiery inferno which results in one death. The driver has a difficult time accepting the death of a friend which he feels he has caused. This book provides an indepth examination of the relationships among the friends, family, and professionals at Hazelwood High School. This book offers a unique approach in writing; for example, the traditonal chapter format is replaced by classroom assignments, journals, personal letters, as well as conversations."
3,2nd and 3rd grade multiplication,Be advised that this book is the 2nd and 3rd grade edition for multiplication.
5,fabulous!,"this delightful cookbook, filled with charming reminiscences, informative food tidbits, mouth-watering recipes, and splendid pictures, provides a feast for the tummy, the mind, and the eyes! a stunningly successful collaboration by mr. villoresi and marie dalby (uncredited on amazon, but her name's on the cookbook's cover). the title labels this a holiday cookbook, but i found it to be year-round appropriate. surely a treasured addition to any foodie's cookbook collection!"
5,A gift.,This book was purchased for a friend who has an interest in Japanese art prints. I was surprised she didn't already have it. Book was as described
3,EARINGS,I purchaced 2 pairs of the same earings for my 2 daughters to give to them as gifts. I was disapointed that both earings game in ONE gift box. How hard would it had been to give me TWO gift boxes for TWO sets of earings?
5,Long lasting,Bought this for my wife as a gift more than 4 years ago and she still uses it often. Very practical and easy to carry.
2,A scanner that looks a lot better than its scans,"Allow yourself to consider this wretched product only if, like me, you can promise yourself to use it solely for simple text scanning, you can find it for under $30 or so, and you have ready access to a scanner that actually works. Otherwise heed the many warnings from other reviewers. If you rely on this thing to scan graphics or photos, the banding and generally lousy image quality will induce the kind of regret normally reserved for those who allowed themselves to be photographed wearing those fluorescent legwarmers back in 1983."
3,Very poor software,"I know a bit about scanners, I've used two of these HP see-throughs for thousands of scans, and I don't expect the software that comes with peripherals to be five-star stuff. But the software with these HP scanners is just astonishingly bad. And I don't mean the extra photo-editing software, but the basic driver stuff that you can't easily avoid. I wrestle and wrestle to get a kinda-works solution. It takes an amazing amount of fussing around, and then it doesn't do what you just told it to do. The hardware is fine, but the software is just unbelievably incompetent. A very shoddy, bait-and-switch, rip-off kind of product. Its designers should be replaced with professionals."
4,Very good deal for the price,"This $30 refurbished HP ScanJet 4600 has performed very well for over a year. No hardware or software problems scanning or printing. I have scanned and enlarged postage stamps with excellent results on monitor and when printed. Not perfect color matching of course, but very good for the price and my needs."
1,HP Trashware,"I bought the HP ScanJet 4600 because I need to scan material from books. The see-through concept is perfect for teachers like me. However, the scanner warms up very slowly. The HP software is astonishingly bad. (Only install the basic driver. Skip Readiris.) The scanner only does simple black and white text scans reliably. After about a year, the hardware stopped working. (More toxic waste for the landfill.) Thank you Carly Fiorina, HP chairman, (given a going away present $21 million when canned in 2005.) I really like spending my meager salary on trashware."
4,It's ok...,"This scanner is ok...but there are some problems, it's not compatible with hp image zone... so you have to unstall hp image zone and install their less advance version that is included in the CD. Also if you scan in high resolution about 1200DPI it's going to be very slow and most photo editing program can't handle that much. Well, scan book is great. You will have to use Readiris 8 that's included in the cd, but I have Readiris Pro 9 that came with my HP LaserJet 3015. I'm only 11 years old and I already know how to set up a wireless network, installing PCI card or what ever card, upgrading the processes, install new device."
3,Not Mac compatible!,"I've had this for many years. I'm now scanning consistently, but only by booting my Mac into Windows (via bootcamp). Previously (before the Intel Macs), it worked erratically in the various versions of Mac OS. They just don't support the Mac. The software interface in Windows XP Pro is very basic and limited. This is the only way for Mac owners to use it. Scanned files can be placed in the shared documents folder. Other than this huge problem, the physical form factor is clever and helpful when scanning large drawings in tiles."
3,Sudden failure,My scanjet had worked just fine but suddenly cannot communicate when I try to start it up. I just installed it on a new computer and get the same error. HP never follows up on my request for support.
2,"hot looks, mixed performance","Doesn't that pretty much sum up the problem with every piece of technology today? Our products look good (or better) but the behavior designed into them is aggravating. CRAPPY SOFTWARE KILLS PRODUCTS!This thing takes too long to warm up. It takes too long for the lamp to return to it's starting position, it takes too long after you see the preview image on your monitor to give you back control. I have piles of stuff waiting to be scanned and I cannot wait for this device to catch up with me."
1,Could not get it to work properly,"The software that comes with this scanner is horrible. I couldn't get it to work properly with the scanner after reinstalling it many times and reboots. For some times when the scanner did work, the scanning quality for pictures was good but that was about it. Tried HP Customer support and they pointed me to TWAIN driver but that also didn' help. The scanner would just stop in middle of scanning and then nothing would work until I would pull out the cable and retry it many times. Didn't have much time and patience to waste more than one day on this beautiful looking useless scanner so returned it. Maybe it was just this peice that was bad, but still I think its not worth even $30 that I spent."
1,"I wish ""0 stars"" were an option!","This scanner is a piece of garbage. Literally. I had to throw it out after only 2 scans. There was some ""fatal hardware error"" that left me and the totally unhelpful people at HP totally mystified. Lucky for them and unlucky for me my warranty seemed to expire about 30 seconds after I bought the product. This horrible scanner made me think twice about ever buying anything from HP again. People tell me you get what you pay for and I should have expected to get a crappy scanner for 30 dollars. Maybe this is true, but I was expecting poor image quality and slow scanning, not a complete lack of scanning ability."
2,Save your money,"I was really disappointed in this movie, slow, and boring. Love Fred Hammond's music, but I could not give this away."
2,Just okay,"It wasn't very good. I didn't hate it, but just wasn't what I expected. It was long and some of the characters were just silly/stupid."
3,Wholesome movie,"This was a good wholesome movie for the family to watch together. It is a Holiday movie but with the message it can be watched any time of the year. It was thought provoking and made you laugh while being a little too dramatic, but the issues and situations was real life. Would love to see more of this type movie and I am sure with the next one Fred Hammond will take it to the next level. If this was Fred's first time I give him thumbs up for a good job. Bless you Fred in all you do!"
3,Fred done diddit again,"This play was well written. I mean Fred doesn't act as well as he sings, but there was enough suspense to keep me watching. Some a his singers, specially Pam Keynon Donald can really act - she was so funny LOL. Great cast, and to really recognize the personal stories that were experienced during the making of this production is really amazing; friends and family members' dying and all. Job well done. And the singing is tight. Not as much as I'd expected but twas good enough."
2,thumbs down,"This book is written for people showing in Britain. It is not particularly helpful for those that show in the US. The author is in a unique position that is really unrealistic for most of us, e.g. her husband built her trailer. Her idea of a shoestring is quite a bit different from mine!"
2,Disappointed,Monday Morning Leadership - 8 Sessions You Won't Want to Miss was a great book. This one does not measure up...
3,A real exercise in Time Travel,"back in the 60's these pseudo scientific soft core porn ""novels"" were all the rage - faux interviews that allowed the author to be oh-so-scientific and also oh-so-racey.And stewardesses were seen as the sexiest of them allIf you're a die hard Lawrence Block completist this book will give you a few pleasant moments - but mostly nostalgia for a long gone past.Enjoy - but don' take any of it too seriously"
5,Great Book,"Drawings of the homes in this book are Very Good. Also, the information about each of the buildings is well researched and easily readable."
1,bird bath deicer,"This looks pretty flimsy , though it seems to do a fair job. My concern is that it could be easily damaged or punctured since it is basically a coil with aluminum foil covering it. There is no UAL label on it . Maybe it isn't covered under the law ?I would buy a better one even if it costs more."
1,what the HECK!!!!!,Ok here is how it goes this double feature was a double boredom. It seemed to drag on and on and on. You get my meaning There was no action and if there was I missed it and Island fury should have been Island boredom. Most of the time you are confused between the flashbacks which I am still not sure why they were in there and what is going on in the present My advice run the other way before you waste your money.
3,Long But Satisfying,"Entertainment or truth? ""UFOs and Close Encounters"" blurs the line between what we think we know and what we wish to prove. Offering nine sections of interviews, reenactments and archaeological examination, the film delves into the theory of aliens moving among us. Will viewers believe it? Perhaps not, but the case made is still quite compelling.No more so than the presentation of the famed Billy Meier story. It is here that the film makes its most credible findings and the audience will appreciate it.What they may hate, however, is the long run-time. ""UFOs and Close Encounters"" clocks in at over 500 minutes. Watching it in one-viewing would be difficult for even the most enthusiastic of conspiracy fans. The DVDs must instead be scheduled between work, school and other obligations; which can make the experience awkward.Is the material worth the effort? Yes. Will most be able to justify devoting that much time to it? No."
4,Very thorough,"SO much information it's almost overwhelming. A lot of lecturing, reinactments, etc. If you are into that sort of thing, this is very much worth it. It's nice to have so much information in one neat set, rather than having to search around and buy a bunch of DVDs to get the same info."
1,Good video cover and that's all,Look like one of those b movie cobbled together sell out to the ufo seekers. Not very enlightening to the phenomenon.
4,great presenters with annoying audience,"Brilliant and amazing information. But right when it gets interesting, someone in the audience has to cough or sneeze or move papers, or do something to distract from the presentation. Frankly, Im suprised that all these brilliant people dont move their symposium to somewhere in the US, where they have better facilities with more advanced graphics, and able to not have to hear the rude audience's bodily functions."
3,"Good printer, Poor wireless","My first response was to echo the experiences of another reviewer. You cannot fault the print quality, but one is led to wonder whether the premium paid for the wireless capabilities is worth it? You can get the same print quality (same printer in fact) without wireless for about $100 less.The wireless features do work, but it does occassionally lose the DHCP lease, and the correct way to setup WPA is hidden deeply in the HP support pages (www.hp.com). Its not for the faint of heart. If you run an open network without passwords of any sort, then this printer will likely work very well and easily (but you are clearly not thinking straight, as that is an open invite to get your network attacked). Be prepared to struggle a little if you are not very network savvy."
1,very frustrating,"Like one of the other reviewers, I am returning mine after 2 weeks of countless hours on the phone with HP tech. support, whom could never fix the problem. The software had problems loading up, then it did not want to work with my router's encryption, and when it did finally work it was totally sporadic. One day it prints, the next day it does not.I have a new compaq laptop with windows XP, I bought a new Linksys router since HP said it must be the problem, they were wrong. I even exchanged my HP 5850 for a different one and it did the same thing.I have not seen any other wireless printers on the market so, like the other reviewer, I am going back to a regular printer with a print server!I am starting to suspect it is not compatible with windows XP. But that is just an uneducated guess."
2,I hope you don't need support from HP!,"I had some problems getting this printer to work on my Linksys wireless-B router. After hanging for hours on the phone to talk to an ""expert"", problem was still not solved. Failed to speak to anybody over there (yes, in India!) who's knowledge extended to 'how to start the setup.exe from the CD rom'. Very frustrating. Finally I started troubleshooting myself and found the problem. Because of the provided support (which is none) I would not recommend to buy this product. If you are a wireless network expert (or want to become one) give it a go. Oh yeah, printer does not work with your firewall on (Win XP), so you are exposed to hackers, etc."
2,Worst HP printer I've ever owned,"I've been buying HP printers for nearly twenty years, and this is the worst I've ever owned. (It's from the Carly Fiorina era, and it shows.) The error messages never seem to have been tested; I don't think I ever saw an ""Out of Paper"" message (crucial for a networked printer), though I don't claim to be able predict how it would react when it ran out of paper. I'm currently (sometimes) getting a ""Service Requested"" message on the web page, though sometimes I get only a partial page, and sometimes I get an ""opened"" error instead--still haven't figured out what those really mean.If anyone can recommend a non-HP Ethernet duplex inkjet printer to replace this, I'd appreciate it, but HP seems to have a lock on that market segment."
2,problems printing PDF files,"I am a Mac user running OS 10.3. When this printer first arrived about a month ago, its included software did not support USB connection to a Mac. This is a bad start considering how common the USB connection is. Finally, I downloaded the latest 2.5 version of the software, but it still does not fully support printing PDF filfes. I am a scientist, and many scientific papers are now published in PDF format. I cannot recommend this to anyone who needs to print PDF files on a regular basis."
2,Massive headache for Mac users,"Despite Apple's claim that the wireless HP 5850 color printer is ""Apple-friendly,"" it took an entire Saturday on the phone with both HP and Apple to configure the printer for use with Airport Express. HP's instruction booklet is insanely complicated--a far cry from Apple's ""Plug 'n' Play"" ease of use--even for a computer savvy Ivy League grad. Under the best conditions, with optimal signal strength and a speedy internet connection, it can still take up to 3 minutes after turning on the printer for it to be ready to print. It made me rethink my insistence on wireless technology--what's a few cords compared to hours of headaches, troubleshooting, and waiting with fingers crossed?"
2,Fair Printer,"While this printer does an excellent job printing text, I was disappointed in the quality of photo printing. Item was purchased because of ad that stated photo quality printing. WELL IT'S NOT! Packing it up to return it now."
1,WORST PIECE OF CRAP,"This is by FAR the worst piece of crap that I have EVER bought, now I have to waste my time repackaging this piece of sh-t to send it back. I could not install this printer to my linksys, customer support sucks! All you get is some guy from india who knows less about the product than you do!Seriously DO NOT buy this product! YOU WILL BE SORRY!"
3,You should have it already!,"I don't think you really need to buy this book, because if you bought FP2000, it comes in the box. I am just warning you of this. The actuall book, I'm glad they included it in the box, but I'm sure there are much better books out there. It is written by MS, and I think they're a little better on the technical side then at print."
5,Nietzschean charity?,"Phenomenal.This brief novel (""nivola"") absolutely blew me away when i read it. Knowing the Kierkegaardian and Nietzschean existential atmosphere De Unamuno was working in, I wasn't quite sure how the catholic angle would fit in, but De Unamuno contines to impress me with everything I read by him. ""San Manuel Bueno, Martir"" is the best thing I have read from him (also recommended, obviously, ""Mist"").Basically what we've got here is a kind of foundationless charity. Instead of turning with Nietzsche violence and the YES (after the collapse of what was), De Unamuno turns here to charity and tradition. Very interesting contrast. Good read. Thought provoking."
5,Hidden Things,"After reading Broken Things by Andrea Boeshaar, I was anxious to read this new book. It is a continuation of her Faded Photographs Series. The reader quickly loves Andera's characters. They experience the type of things that all of us struggle with. It increased my faith to read about how Kylie learned to trust the Lord and understand how to follow God's will in her life. Kylie had hard decisions to make. She fought feelings of betrayal from many people. Sometimes, she didn't react the right way, but the end of the book was satisfying. I can hardly wait for the third book in this series."
3,Cheesy but gory fun,"I know the adaptation of Jack Kethum's ""Offspring"" has it's problems one being acting with some of the characters ,costume and a few other flaws but I really enjoyed this gory little fun fest.I had heard so many negative things about it I didn't watch it right away but I'm glad I did.It's really quite shocking and very gory in parts and the gore was very well done.At the end of the day it's a movie I'll watch again."
3,Disappointing,"I hate to agree with the other reviews on this site, but Offspring is a big disappointment for Ketchum fans, particularly on the heels of The Girl Next Door and The Lost. Besides what has already been stated, I think the problem was that they waited too long to make this film and in the interim films like The Hills Have Eyes remake and countless other ""cannibal family"" movies had hit the screen, so the idea just doesn't feel fresh. I'm giving it 3 stars because Ketchum fans will probably want to check it out anyway, but overall it's too little too late."
1,What?,"Very choppy...disoriented...and confusing. I'm not really sure I watched a movie that made sense...from start to finish. I tried to understand what was going on...but even the police in the film didn't have a clue but for a alcoholic retiree. There was plenty of second rate gore and pain, but gore needs to be partners with a sensible plot. I couldn't find one. ""GHOST HOUSE"" should be ashamed that they placed this one in their horror collector's file. You've lost a lot of credibility with me."
2,CHILDREN OF THE CORNY,"The Offspring is one of those movies that's so awful you have to stare at the screen and keep watching to see if it can get any worse. It does. Cannibalistic, feral children whose idea of show and tell is disembowelment-and a simple disembowelment is a slow night to these kids. They grunt, stab, grunt, mutilate, grunt,and the quickly passed over reason for their existence is that they are the offspring of the children of a lighthouse keeper gone missing off the coast of Maine in the 19th century. I gave this movie two stars because despite the lousy plot, lousy script, lousy acting--the cannibal kids can't even grunt convincingly, the movie is so fascinatingly bad that everyone should watch it to see just how bad a movie can be. Oh scratch that thought----don't watch it."
4,not so well written but still absorbing....if this is your interest,"even with an inclusion of bunch of analysis about other's writing that I don't care about, this is an interesting biography and a cultural history with some sound insights into the people and the times of Mabel Luhan."
4,"Nifty design, nice scan, but a little slow","This scanner is versatile, compact, and makes great scans. It was incredibly easy to install on my 3.5 yr old computer (with Windows XP). In the short time I've had it, I've successfully scanned photos, negatives, and text using the OCR feature. The picture produced from the negative was about 3""x5"", but was adequate for my needs. The text scan was produced by placing the portable scanning screen over an open book. It produced only a few text errors.My only complaint is that it's slower than I thought it would be. It's still faster than my 3 yr old Canon, but not nearly as fast as the similarly priced flatbed HP scanner my sister purchased last summer. Perhaps when I have a big batch of pictures I'll still have to go to her house to scan them..."
1,"Nice to look at, poor scan quality","I have an HP Scanjet 4C that has been a workhorse for the past 4-5 years (It still works, but my new Macintosh doesn't support SCSI devices). So, in deciding on a purchase I chose HP again out of loyalty. Set-up on the 4670 was easy, the software acceptable (typical of HPs), and the scanner itself was beautiful. Unfortunately all images that I scanned were plagued with 1/2"" tall bands of light and dark areas. I found no way to remedy this and was forced to return the scanner for a refund."
4,HP4670 requires USB 2.0 hub on Dell 8300,"When the HP4670 was connected to my Dell 8300, the Intel 82801 USB Universal Host Controller reported ""Device Not Recognized"" and ""Unknown Device"". The solution is to buy a USB 2.0 hub. The software install reported error 1904, hpgwiamd.dll failed to install; this error can be ignored.Scanned photos look great. 35mm slides are cumbersome to swap in and out."
1,a beautiful piece of junk,"another reviewer said don't use this scanner for anything other than docs - mine won't even do docs consistently - more than one page is asking too much - even if the preview indicates it scanned the entire page, when you go back and check the pdf file, it is missing pieces of the page - and getting the image at all is hit or miss - I've had 8-10 scans in a row show up with nothing but a black screen - UNBELIEVABLE!!!"
1,TERRIBLE BANDING PROBLEMS,"i've bought and returned 5 of this scanner (both 4600 and 4670). all with the same problem with the banding no matter what i scan and it's not just on the image but the whole scan area. i'm on a mac powerbook g4 with all the trimmings and latest os.hp support is useless and all they can do is replace. but after a few of this nonsense, i made them refund everything. but since i love the design so much i thought if i just start over and maybe i'll get lucky. no such luck. i just opened mine and it's the same problem so i'm packing it right up and getting something else."
3,dino sore,"I have had this scanner for some time. Got it for its versatility especially with scanning from large books. I just confirmed with HP that it is not compatible with either Windows 8 or Mac Lion. and there are no updates planned at this point. Therefore, it unfortunately has gone Jurassic."
4,"Nice scanner, neat idea","I became fascinated with this scanner when I saw it in a local store -- the ability to take a scanning ""plate"" and put it over objects (a book or whatever) seemed like one of those ideas they should have done a long time ago. The design, which looks a little like a picture frame, is nice too -- you can use it to store favorite photos when it's not in use. Unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problems with the software and, yes, there are options to save settings in between settings (I suggest examining the help files or more fully exploring the software menus.) I tried it on an XP and MacOS X system and it worked well. Really impressed with the Mac support overall for the scanner. It's a little slower than I'd like, but still a nice package."
1,Seriously Flawed,"*Very* ugly ""banding"" lines. Ordered a replacement..same thing! Determined to be defective by objective party. (I use Mac 10.3.)"
1,FAR to slow!,"I waited 10 minutes for a scan of a bussines card in 600 dpi!!300 dpi scans fine but anything higher takes to long, with a bigger scan you can wait more than 30 minutes where my Epson takes 4..."
3,"Nice design, not sure about the scanning quality","I bought this for several reasons - the physical design, which both looks nice and doesn't take up too much space on my already cluttered desk, the ability to do panoramic scans by moving the scanner over the medium rather than the other way round, and the general technical specs. I've had it less than a day so far, and have mixed feelings. I haven't owned a scanner before, other than a drop in scan cartridge for Canon printer, and so didn't really know what to expect, but the quality on scanning photos seems poor. I suspect this is mostly due to the settings. For example, if you change the default sharpness from ""medium"" to ""none"", the results are much better. Of course, you can fix up a lot of this stuff in software afterwards, but I'd prefer it if I didn't have to."
1,Seriously flawed,"I loved the design of this scanner and needed to be able to scan both large items and negatives. Unfortunately, the scanner doesn't work properly. Negatives come out greenish yellow where there should be blue; light colored pictures come out with banding -- dark and light bands across the picture. Tech support seemed very aware of both problems and told me to return the scanner to the store where I bought it. Both phone and email support did not indicate that there was any fix for these problems. Too bad, as I really wanted this scanner. I hope HP fixes the problem; if they do, I'll buy it again."
4,Works great!!,"I'm a network administrator (among other things!!) and my boss decided to buy this scanner for my department. I do a LOT of scanning and I don't have any complaints about this scanner. We've had it for about a year without any problems. It's true it takes a while doing the first scan, because it has to ""warm up the lamp"", but after that it's very fast. It comes with some bundled software you can use to scan several parts of a large image and then put them together like a puzzle, but to be honest I rather use photoshop to do that job, and I get great results!!However, I'm giving it 4 stars because I think it doesn't scan negatives as good as it should; for documents it's excellent!!"
1,Dreadful: Crashed on both PC & Mac,I run a small imaging workgroup. This scanner seemed worth a try for scanning odd formats: textiles & orginial art.This is about the 20th scanner that I have installed over the years--the only one that would not function on either platform.Clever design: too bad that the hardware is so buggy.
1,$200 picture frame?,"Hardware is crap. Software is worse. Depending on original, output is fair to worthless with stripes and bands. No more business with HP."
1,Plenty problems,"I'm now on my third scanner of this type.The first worked for ca. 1 week until it went dead in the middle of a scan. I returned it to the shop and soon recieved a new one. This lasted for a month - and the same thing happened again. Well, today I recieved my third scanner, which worked fine - for 15 minutes!! Three different scanners, same problem. The design and consept is great - but that does not help at all. If i could rate this with 0 stars I would."
2,SLOW at high resolution,It is so slow when scanning at 600dpi or more and if you look very carefully you can find the color has a certain white and black patten because the scanner scanner the same place twice at higher resolution.I won't suggest anyone to buy this one and the 2 stars is for the style.
2,Not impressed,"These mugs are not enormous. They are a good size for soup, but they're not measurably better than similar I've purchased at a dollar store. There are flaws in the finish and I'm just not impressed for over eight bucks a mug. I guess it's all in the brand name."
4,A Charming Complication,"Because they are novels, all Regency heros & heroines must rise above some complications before wedded bliss is theirs. Blackwood's Lady is no exception to this rule. Blackwood, the hero, decides what he wants in a wife. Propriety is at the top of his list. Love & romance is off his list. Blackwood believes that Nicola, the heroine, fits his bill so he proposes. Nicola is about to refuse him when his captivating smile changes her mind. She accepts his offer of marriage. Nicola, however, has a unique hobby that her fiance knows nothing of. As the book proceeds, the couple fall in love as Blackwood discovers, to his chagrin, his lady's unusual hobby. Misunderstandings abound. But in the end, all is resolved. Blackwood accepts his fiancee's hobby & is willing to participate in it with her. This book was very enjoyable to read & I believe I would enjoy reading it a second time as much as I enjoyed reading it the first time."
1,Not very good,"I got it and after a week of trying to set it up I gave up. Why? Let me tell you, I took forever to configure my desktop to work with the router and than the wireless PC card would not work with my laptop no matter what I did and how hard I try. I did this for one week and than I took it back to the store and I got Linksys wireless AP cable/dsl 4 point router and wireless PC card to go with it. Best thing I've ever done. I got home, got it out of the box and in less than one hour I was up and running - wireless. It was simple and easy to configure, the CD did most of the work and it communicate good with the PC card on my laptop. If you looking for a wireless network - get Linksys, they also have 1 800 number for help and support and also Linksys has other wireless products. Great product and good price."
4,Cute,"These earrings are cute, simple, and elegant. I don't give a 5-star because I found the pole to be too short. I have lost the back of my earrings several times before even with longer pole, so losing it this time is not a surprise to me. If you don't mind stocking on some extra backs, or be extra careful on making sure that the back of your earrings are pushed tight against your ears, then this is a great buy."
3,"Nice mug, bad advertising...","In all honesty, this is a really nice mug. Well made, sturdy...all that jazz. However, I was definitely looking for something with at least the advertised 18 ounce capacity. Not a mere 16 ounces.Overall, I'm relatively happy with my purchase (it's a gift), but only because I cannot seem to locate a mug in this color that is larger."
3,Too small,"I got two of these mugs (one lemongrass and one peacock). They are very nice and well made, but definitely won't hold 18 oz. unless you fill it to the absolute brim. Then you can't pick it up! They will comfortably hold 14 oz.(I measured this), but not 18. I wish I had read more reviews, first."
1,Product is fine service is terrible,"Amazon does not tell you that they cannot provide this product. It does not matter what shipping you selected, it will be many months before your product arrives. You will receive the classic mumbo-jumbo about how it is the supplier's fault. No matter all Amazon is doing at this point is false advertisement. You do not find out that they cannot provide the product until after you have completed your order, totally dishonest! We ordered two of these cups first week of October and have been told to expect arrival in mid-or late December. I would not purchase these products from Amazon."
5,I wish I could get these is every color!,"I love love love fiestaware! When we moved to our first home I knew that I wanted my new dishes to be only fiesta. I decided to order the 5 piece set( with the small tea cups) in 8 different colors. I ordered as many of these large mugs that matched as I could find. We use them all the time. I use them for tea, coffee(they work beautifully with my k-cup machine) and even for soup and cereal sometimes. They microwave well and wash well on the top or bottom rack. I only wish that amazon carried all of the available colors in one listing! I have resorted to ordering from megachina in the past for my fiesta needs but really hate paying s&h when I have a prime account."
5,Great Mug,This is a great product! It allows you to take large quantities of liquid (18 ounces) anywhere you would like. The secret is the cup-like shape that contains the liquid as if by magic.I like big mugs and I can't deny!
3,"Okay, not great",The cup arrived intact but was dirty and seemed a little worn. I was kind of disappointed but not enough to return it.
5,Love Fiesta,"I had always admired Fiesta-ware and decided to finally purchase these mugs. They are awesome, bought several colors. It's excellent for soup and a lovely giant cappuccino! I also bought the storage canisters. One of the canister lids chipped, but it was also dropped, so you do have to be more careful with any stoneware or ceramic obviously. Very high quality and the colors really add punch to the kitchen."
5,"nice, big mugs with lots of uses","These mugs are great! We have a plum and turquoise mug. The plum was actually my first Fiesta purchase. We use our jumbo mugs all the time for all kinds of things (see: picture of baby bunnies in mugs). They're great for tea or hot chocolate, but also for soup, chili, oatmeal, mac and cheese, reheated leftovers, or even to use as a cute candy dish. I ended up with an extra turquoise mug and plan to make it into a candle. I see that a lot of people have complained about the size of the mug, but it has worked fine for me. We don't really buy the big cans of soup. When we do buy soup, we get the regular Campbell's kind that you add water to. If you leave out a bit of the water, the size of the mug is just perfect and the soup tastes better too."
1,"Sometimes, size does matter...","I'm with the hubby on a previous review. It's advertised as being an 18 oz. mug and it is most definitely NOT. Using a Pyrex measuring cup I found my mug holds 14 oz. A half cup short makes a big difference. Looks-wise it's okay, but it is too small for my purposes. I feel used."
3,have had 2 for a couple weeks and both handles are starting to break,"I love the size and color of these mugs, but the handles are already starting to break off (can hear the ceramic moving and can see a crack when you hold the handle). I'm not sure if the 2 mugs I bought were an anomaly or that the product is just poorly put together."
3,Thorough but uninspired,"There's no question that William Root knows what he's writing about, but I found this book rather dry and uninspiring. Still, it's well organized and formatted with lots of example hands and reading it would certainly be of some value to the improving player.I'd recommend ""Card Play Technique"" by Victor Mollo instead."
2,Worth about half the price.,This product came in an embarrasing sex toy advertised box. I was hoping to purchase a regular enema set that you used to see at stores like Walgreens. The red nozzles are cheap plastic. I really don't think it's worth this price.
1,Just doesn't work - shocking software,"Possibly the worst software I have seen; over 400mb and it just doesn't work. Have succeeded at wireless printing, but all other functions will not work wirelessly. Errors thrown up at shutdown. Truly horrid."
2,Software/Hardware Communication Issues,Great idea. Wireless networking. Yet have had two 2510xi's in the last month and have had communication issues with both. Technical Support has asked me to re-install the software 3 times on the current issue plus spent more time gettin incoming fax to work properly. Total time with Tech Support 12 plus hours and still have a system that doesn't work properly. Maybe best to wait until HP or other companies come out with wireless units available.
2,Don't buy it!!!,"I'm utterly disgusted with this item. It works beautifully 10% of the time, so so 20%, and flat out doesn't work 70%. I really don't care if it's the software or hardware - the whole product seems third worldly anyway. It's a real piece of crap. Don't waste your money.Bill"
2,"Half-baked product, terrible support","As other reviewers have written, the 2510 is a nightmare to install -- even when following the instructions precisely - for someone with a technology background. I pity the newbie trying to install this.I have had this unit for about three months. I can print wirelessly, which is why I purchased it. The software is a POS and locks up my laptop with XP (hpqtra08) every time upon shutting down. The other features like scanning have never worked well and I gave up on the support people who know very little or NEVER CALL BACK AS PROMISED. Faxing has worked o.k.Would like to read memory cards and transfer to desktop, but of course that has never worked and HP support can't figure it out after hours on the phone WITH technicians. If the software wasn't so BLOATED with so many BUGS, I would probably be happy with simply having a wireless, but everytime my laptop locks upon upon shutdown, I am reminded..."
1,Avoid this printer!,"I bought this unit for my home office. It still works, but the Software is terrible and I no longer use the wireless feature on the unit. It faxes and copies good enough, but printing and scaning pictures have not worked so well. I wish I had done more research on this unit and avoided all the problems and countless hours trying to make it work as it should. At one point I did have everything up and running, but it always would bog down and I would have to reboot the computer and/or HP so they could see each other and most of the time the HP unit would always freeze up. HP should have done the homework before selling this on the market."
4,"Wireless is just awesome, just awesome.","This printer breaks all barriers as far as convience goes. Just one wire, the plug !! No cables ~~ no need to keep the printer in the same room as your computer. YOU can put it where YOU WANT.. A+ for laptops..Initial hookup is not for the faint of heart, but if you just forge ahead with the setup, you can nail it... Once you install the drivers via CD or download them from HP's web sight, you're on your way..The overall quality is pretty dang good................."
1,Linksys router provided trouble,"I bought this printer 11 days ago... The printer appreared to have problems responding to my linksys wireless G router.HP's support is absolutely awful. I have spent hours on hold, just to be hung up on, and I have not found 1 person there who knows anything about this printer. I spent hours on the phone with them just going over the same things found in the basic instructions for the printer. They don't have any clue how to support this printer yet, and they have no clue how to provide good customer support at all.I noticed that the gentleman that discovered his router was set to G devices only was able to use this printer. I have it set to mixed mode and it immediately turns its wireless tranmission off. Maybe others will have better luck than I (I tried it with windows 2000 professional both wired and wireless and 98SE wireless). I'm taking it back tomorrow. I am wondering if the wireless chip is faulty in the printer (webserver on the printer worked fine)."
1,Piece of garbage...HP support useless,"Have yet to get scanner to communicate...either in wired or wireless mode. Spent 2 hours w/ 'tech support', if you can call it that, last night. Downloaded latest drivers/software....all &^*^# GB of it....still get the 'error communicating with scanning device'....totally dead in the water and HP saying they don't have this problem with wireless, only with wired, and have a fix for that...hey they should read a few postings....like I SHOULD have....you have been warned....it's worthless!!"
4,"Awesome hardware, horrible software","This is a phenomenal piece of computer hardware, though the software that comes with it leaves a lot to be desired. Under Mac OS X, you'll want to repair your permissions after you install the software. Under Windows XP, be prepared to have nearly a gig of hard disk space. The printer output is phenomenal."
4,Great Printer / Security Nightmare,"Bought and installed the 2510 on a home wireless network running both PC and Mac computers. Before you install shut off every piece of security you have on every computer, router, hub, etc. The only problem I had was trying to to turn the encription back on to my Airport Extreme Base Station. HP said that it was an apple issue and Apple said that it was an HP issue. I did finally get it to work. The printer works great and the instant share program that allows me to load a photo card and email pictures directly from the printer is nice. The HP tech told me that it nomrally takes him an hour to do a proper instalation so be prepared for some work."
2,Roll the dice on the install,"I bought this product, and returned it about 3 days later, after fruitlessly trying to get the 400+ MB of software to install.My installation would go about 75% and then die on a ""fatal error"". After several failed installs, I found this document on HP's site, which convinced me to return the printer and cut my losses:http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?product=303770⟨=en&lc;=en&cc;=us&dlc;=en&docname;=c00093927#Doc_ProcThe solutions offered here involve, editing the registry, manually deleting files, renaming folders, etc. I really can't afford to risk trashing my OS and breaking other software just to get this working. I'll look for a solution that's easier to use.The hardware seemed pretty nice, but I think it's a roll of the dice if the software will install on your system."
2,Great Hardware Lousy Software,"The PSC2510 hardware works great. The full software load option is ridiculous because it takes up lots of storage space on the hard drive and slows down my machine (HP Director).Not in this order, I have setup the printer in USB mode (The best and fastest working mode). I setup it up in Wireless and Wired networking modes which end up wasting hours/days of productive time I could have had. I experienced everything from setup issues to the printer losing its network connection.If you want to use this printer via a USB connection it is reliable. If you want to use it via networking, be aware and try some other model or brand!"
3,"Hardware good, software sucks baaad","Just like everyone else here, I have had this printer for going on 3 years now. The hardware works like a champ. NO breakage and whatnot but I have been having severe issues with the software not being able to properly connect to the printer via wireless. ALso after various software updates and uninstalls and reinstalls, it still has an executing installer that continues to reinstall the updates again and again. THe software install is gigantic and has lots of security issues and bloated with spyware."
3,Amazon programmers are dummy's,"I thought HP was annoying with their stupid printing software... Amazon allows you to type in a 500 word review for a product and when you go to click on a link for review guidelines...you lose your whole review. Idiots....the link should be a pop up window!!!! I dont feel like posting my stupid review now, I am so frustrated."
4,Life in a blink!,"As a legitimate proud of a the most faithful tradition of the Neo Realism tradtion, Tornatore returns to Sicily to undertake the task of telling us the life and times of a fervent believer of the new hopes of a better tomorrow.The man and his circumstances, disavenences through thirty years from his early youth until his early fifties. The film captivates and engages, and if it's true it lacks of the enraptured magic of Cinema Paradise, the movie will reward you, due its unforgettable and laughable vignettes all the way through, without loosing ends about the inner contradictions between the reformer politician and the old fashioned head of family.The marvelous introduction reminds us so much to De Sica's Miracle in Milan, where the fantasy and surrealistic images allows us to be part of his narrative scheme.Terrific cast, splendid script and amazing photography make of this movie a must-see. Don't miss it."
1,Aspect Ratio was changed on this blu-ray,"For those that care, this blu-ray version hacked the original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 to 1.78:1. If you want to see the film the way it originally was, you will have to import a blu-ray or dvd from another country."
4,Baaria,"Very nice movie. Touching and well made. Memorable, a bit confusing, still not sure about the way the ending ties to the beginning."
3,Served the purpose,I bought this for my son's playroom. It is very thin but looks good. You get what you pay for. The edges are unfinished.
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this book to supplement my QM grad course. It did a so-so job. The best chapter is where he introduces the 3-D picture. He introduces angular momentum very well. In fact his presentation is the most clear I've seen. Only have reading Morrison did the 3-D shro. equ. and how the ang. mom. operator comes into the picture click. Morrison does a good job with teaching the reader to deal in terms of eigenvalue equations (a thing he harped on a lot in his first book).There are downsides though. The biggest is that he does not cover WKB approximation. And his dealing with Perturbation Theory in general is not that good and the notation not helpful.Overall, it might be nice to buy if you need some help in QM 2. Another advantage is that it's not too expensive."
2,OK Scans But Poor Durability,"I'm going to keep this short. The scanner preformed well with all tasks except, as noted elsewhere, the Automatic Photo Feeder option and its many problems--failure to feed, jams, misalignment, ad nauseum. Seeing as how the APF is the main reason for buying this scanner, such issues become major concerns.But that's all been exhaustively detailed. My main complaint has to do with longevity: I've had the scanner a little over 2 years and it died dead. HP said there was nothing they could do but offered me a ""special deal"" of an upgrade. Well, their offer was indeed special, especially pricy. NewEgg offered the same scanner, shipped, for $65 less. Yikes.My last scanner, a Canon, lasted for 9 years before I decided to upgrade to the HP. The Canon was still working beautifully the day I got rid of it.Upshot: not happy with HP, product quality, supposed support, and product durability."
1,The auto feeder does not work!,"Dont waste your time on this one. You are buying for the auto feed mechanism but you will find that it works so sporadically that you would be much better off lifting the cover and scanning by hand. With the by hand method there is far less frustration. With the auto feeder you are tempted to try to make the machine do what the instructions promise it will do. This cost time and will undoubtedly raise your blood pressure a few notches.Dont waste your money. A good flatbed scanner can be had for $..., Why pay close to $... more for an attachment that has no value. Also there is no way to get anyone from customer service on the line if you also have a life that does not include being on hold and shuffled around. I'll never buy anything from this company again."
1,If you own a MAC RUN!,It took me forever to get this scanner working with Mac OSx Leopard.After I upgraded to Snow Leopard it broke again.The support for MACs is abysmal and as others pointed out the photo feeder jams constantly or will miss grabbing the photo forcing you to feed them in one at a time as well as correcting for miss alignment.Horrible absolutely Horrible.
1,It grew old quickly,"Scanning was difficult. ... and after a 1 yr the scanning was distorted. it is long, long, long gone !"
2,"Scan quality is good, the automatic photo feeder poor","The quality of the scan is good and the software is easy to use, but the photos jam periodically coming out of the feeder. I bought it specifically for the automatic photo feeder and that is the reason for the 2 stars. If the feeder is not important to you, then you will be happy with this scanner."
3,Do not buy this for scanning slides!,"Having boxes of childhood slides that I wanted to convert to digital, all of the product details showed this to be the one, for the money.The slide holder allows a scan of 3 slides at once, BUT... When you crop the 8 1/2 x 11 digital image down to one slide, and zoom in to see the image, the quality is worthless. The colors are gone and the resolution is terrible.Since I ONLY bought this for scanning slides, it is going back. The Minolta DiMAGE Scan Dual IV (2891-301) Film Scanner seems to be the right machine, and for only $279 vs $195 for this one.Works fine for images that are 3x5 or larger, but DO NOT buy it for scanning slides!"
5,Happy movie with Michael J. Fox,A great fun loving movie and Michael J. Fox is great in this old movie
3,It was fun,"no, not an academy award winner, but it was fun to watch, and it was light but fun entertainment. If you want serious, just wake up in the morning and live life. Othewise take a break with this movie, and just don't take it seriously."
3,Bad,"When I first watched this film, I actually enjoyed it.But after 10 years (maybe more) When I purchased this in DVD, I kinda hated it.There's no difference with this film and 'Working Girl'.Actually Working girl is more fun to watch and the story is more convincing.The film quality is good enough. It's a DVD not a Bluray or something."
5,Good clean fun & laughs,"A good plot that really could have happened in the 80s. Fox I dont think ever did a movie that the whole family of any age couldn't sit down and watch. One scene is a little perverted but can be passed over as ""they took a nap"". other than that I loved it, and have for 30 years."
2,"Classic 80's, but really really bad","Fox is OK, but the movie is so predictiable and such a farce of what business life is like!!"
3,"good comical movie, but that's all","If you want to wander over a fairyland, this movie is a good choice. I assure it does not disappoint you. Well, as for me, for 2 hours, all the problem of my life (job, boss, family, etc.) has disappeared into a comical world. But, when I watched it again, I could not help thinking it as a different movie. Story is simple, characters (though I admit Michael J Fox made a wonderful performance) are typical, and anyway there is no reality in it. So, I advise you. When your failure or misfortune discourages you, please watch this movie once, not twice."
2,You can keep your secret,"A Kansas farm boy (Michael J. Fox) travels to the Big Apple and rockets to the top of the corporate food chain through a combination of hard work and trickery. There is not a single convincing moment in this film. The performers work hard but they are hampered by mediocre, lackluster script and direction. The result is a standard sitcom situation stretched out for two interminable hours, with a ludicrous resolution. The soundtrack, which reminds one of the days when synthesizers ruled Hollywood and middle-of-the-road AOR garbage like Night Ranger seemed to blast from every radio, does nothing to improve the situation./"
4,1980's Corporate America at its best!,"If there's anyone out there who wonders what 1980's corporate America felt like, dressed like, and acted like, this is the movie for you! My favorite parts include: working out in the ""executive gym"", the ""I have so much work to do"" attitude of the executive lounge, and of course, Fox's midnight symphony conducting. This movie pulls the lead in TNT staples over the Beastmaster trilogy."
4,"OOOHHH, Yeah!",A pure fluff and fun movie with a rather clever theme. Helen Slater was a last minute replacement and her performance is a bit wooden but adequate for this very enjoyable film. A nice addition to the comedy section of your DVD collection.
3,Average book,"In my opinion, I think this is a very average calculus textbook. It lacks proofs for many theorems and puts too much emphasis on the graphing calculator and other computer technologies in both chapters and problems (what do you expect from some egghead in MIT?) On the other hand, all the information is organized nicely and everything seems accurate for a first edition. But I have seen better. In my personal opinion, Salas & Hille's Calculus is a better book."
5,excelent,"Nice book,good price,excellent.I love it.fast shipping.Book is as is description.Hard cover,and very good.Almost like new.Some minor things but basicaly book is ok."
1,the epitome of mediocrity,"This book is very poor. I give it a poor rating because the solution manuals that compliment this book are very mediocre. The solution manual that came with the book (It came bundled with the text at my college bookstore) seems as though it was hastily put together. Some answers are wrong, have typos, or even lacking altogether. The solution manual only covers chapters 1-12. The remaining chapters are covered in another manual...that's where the above problems are thrown into plain view. In the second solution manual, some answers don't match, are missing, or wrong. For example, chapter 13 has two sections that are flipped around, which shows the haste in bringing out this book. I have nothing good to say about these texts. When Calculus 3 is over this semester, I have 660+ pages worth of TP...that's the only way I feel the purchased can be justified."
1,"Oh Please, Motorola give me a break","This is rated up to 8 miles with just 1 watt of power, which is impossible. I have the Motorola Talkabout t6250 which also has 1 watt of power and is supposed to go up to 5 miles and it goes only 10 feet further than the frs .5 watt Talkabouts. The .5 watt frs only goes about .24 miles. Now they went from 5 miles to 8 miles with only 1 watt of power. COME ON MOTOROLA DO YOU THINK WE ARE STUPID. MORE POWER IS MORE DISTANCE."
3,This movie rocks!,"Soundtrack fits this flick great. Does anyone know that song that's playing in the car when Andy leaves the bar with the drunk woman (Judd Apatow's wife in real life!), the shell-fish and daiquiri woman?"
5,40-Year-Old Virgin,Purchased this as a gift. The recipient absolutely loved it. Item was shipped quickly and was packaged securely. Would purchase this item again.
3,40 year old virgin,"got this album for one song only"" believe or not"" but the album is ok for making your love of your life happy, so if you want it get this album your love will love you forever.."
3,answer to a kid's review,"the song that was playing while andy & beth were ""dancing"" is Red Light Special by TLC (on the crazysexycool album)"
2,Not worth buying,"I was very disappointed with this book. I had expected some wonderful recreations of patterns and designs I had seen in tapestries and photos of Tudor castles and medieval settings but very little of that is to be had here. If you are interested in it, check out a copy of this at your local library before purchasing, if you're still interested go forth and buy, but at least you'll have heads up on the limited nature of this collection."
4,tad bit dissapointing,"Scarface with or without the ghetto boys is one of the hardest rappers in the business. this is where most of his appeal lies. But also what drew me in to this one was more thought provoking lyrics than i had expected. Songs like ""No tears"" , or"" as i seen a man die."" make the listener hear but also feel at the same time. This same quality that makes this album worth buying is also its weakness. Weak lyrics provided in ""g's"" and ""one"", kill the lp's chance of joining classics like ""all eyes on me""and "" The croniic"" of the g funk era. The dairy is worth every penny though the best songs are ""no tears."" ""white Sheet"" ,and 'hand of the dead body"" featuring the rock solid Ice cube"
4,Preety Dope,"Yeah, Scarface definetely has the slow, menacing taunt that makes him such an effective ""gangster."" He is able to talk about the violent subjects of his albums with ease. Songs like No Tears, White Sheet and One Time show this. Yet, he's also got a more insightful, soft side, like I Seen a Man Die. His hardcore, street style is real, and even his softer moments are good, though there are not many. If you like gangsta rappers like Tupac, Spice 1, even Notorious BIG, you should like this."
4,"Doing what he does best, 4.5 stars","The only reason I can't give this album 5 stars is because that would put it on the same level with his latest album, ""The Fix"", which is an all-time hip-hop classic. That being said, this album is as real as it gets, a must have for Scarface fans."
4,Face's best,well it's between mr scarface and this for his best solo records. Face laid the foundation for introspective suicidal depressed ass rap. He did that style better than pac ever did.
3,It dies after less than 2 years.,"I helped my friend to set up this printer when she first got it. The set up is a smooth one, and it worked ok. But after lightly usage for less than 2 years, it just died. I brought it to the printer maintenance shop, and the technician commented this particular HP model is known to have the problem with its main board. He's run into quite a lot of them died of the main board. Of course, it's not worthwhile to replace the main board cause it costs US$80, about the same price my friend paid for the AIO itself."
3,"Better than nothing, but worse than my old HP t45!","This all-in-one came without a usb cable, despite the Website promise that it was included. And the software was missing a driver, hpgreg32.dll. When I went online to a live ""technician,"" he told me to create a text file into the /bin folder and call it hpgreg32.dll! When I asked him how a text file was going to turn into a critical driver, (water-into-wine?) he sent me to the HP download page--but the driver was not listed. So I went to the Internet and downloaded it from www.dll-files.com. the unit is slow, hogs resources, and delivers faded copy. As I stated in the title, this unit is better than nothing, but is not as robust as my old workhorse t45.Tech-support is either non-existent or non-us-based."
4,No USB cable uncluded,"This is my first multi-function printer. I bought this because it was the cheaper verion.The printer looks very cheap.The plastics used to make this printer probably cost no more then 5 cents.The perforamnce is not that bad.Printing a black/white document is pretty quick, and the colors isn't that slow.The copying on the otherhand is very slow.The good news it that it can take up to 15? pages instead of putting one page one at a type to copy it.It's a little loud, but nothing serious.To sum it all up, for the price I paid, $150 for the printer and $25 for the USB cable, this printer is okay.For the price I paid, I should of got a Cannon printer which included the cable and looked a lot better then this printer.Don't know about it perforamance wise, but, I think the cannon one is quieter."
1,BUY HP AT YOUR OWN RISK!,"No matter how good a product is, the company that stands behind it is just as important! HP Customer Service loses interest in their products shortly after the warranty expires. In fact, they simply DON'T SERVICE the product, they will only sell you an ""upgrade"". Unless you have a long extended warranty, I would not touch HP with a 20 foot pole."
1,Cheap & Quirky,"I'm on my second version of this machine which I bought because I could scan legal size from the glass. It's one of the few electronic purchases I regret.The build is cheap. Paper guides are loose and ADF jams easily. Carriage stalls easily. Noisy. The trap door to access the print carriage finally broke off it's little plastic pin...do I need to go on? HP's mindless customer service told me it wasn't a 'user replaceable' part and I'd have to take it in for service to replace this little 9"" piece of plastic. For quality and service, I'd have done just as well at a pawn shop.HP Director software is slow, bloated and hangs constantly, despite HP software updates (2GHz Pentium4 running XP with 1.5GB RAM). Even my poor ol' Canon with parallel printer cable that the HP replaced was better than this.Upshot is that I replaced it with a Brother multifunction (MFC-665CW) considering, for one, I have a 20 year old Brother fax/ans machine that still works just fine."
4,Great product at an affordable price,"I bought this recently. Installation was very very easy, just pop the CD and follow the instructions. Although it took about 30 minutes. I have read other people talking about problem in Windows XP, I would suggest them to get there operating system straight. Clean it up. I have tried printing several pages as well as copying and faxing. Everything worked fine. Print quality & speed is fairly good. One cannot expect a cheap AIO to behave like a laser printer. It is noisy but I don't thing that's too bad. It comes with too many software that one might not need. The best thing is the small footprint. The fax uses a two 2-wire telephone cord, but an adapter is provided."
1,HP Printer without the important thing,"Well, I support what Kelly said. There was NO USB cable. It is not a expensive thing to include. Will have to run to the store to get a USB cable?. That is crazy.Hope HP will not make cars and sell it without tires."
4,"Good item for the price, but boy is it LOUD!","We bought this all-in-one to replace three large items in my small office. I got it at a really good price.... we brought it home, installed it, only to find it making the loudest noises I have heard since dot matrix days! We compared it to our HP DeskJet (which we haven't yet removed) and there was no competition as to speed and sound. The deskjet smoothly slides the paper out, and is almost as quiet as a laser printer. This thing has the print cartridge roam back and forth across the page, and you can see (and hear) it. Watch out when copying... the feeder works well, but it makes this really loud whirring noise. We're trying to figure out if we should spend the extra ching for the next model up. I'm serious when I say it reminds me of the level of printers we saw 10 years ago. However, printing quality is fantastic and sound aside, this is definitely the best 'bang for your buck.' (but wow, what a bang!)"
2,HP5510 Scan button,"I've had my HP5510 for 4 weeks. So far everything works to my expectations except--when I press the scan button an error comes up on the LED: Unable to scan documents from Printer to PC. No Scan Options. You need to install or run HP software forfeature. Press OK to continue."" My system is 4 weeks old. I had a local reputable company put my system together. We uninstalled and installed HP software several times. Went to HP website-could not find a patch. Couldn't repair error. My last resort is to call HP which I haven't yet."
3,HP 5510 All in One,I bought this as a compromise since my last HP died after hooking up a defective USB2 hub. Wiped out the USB and parallel ports.This is a simpler product than the HP I had before but I do like the flat bed feature which my K60 didn't have. Print time seems ok. Everytime HP changes a product the print cartridges change so I have a stack of non-conforming cartridges in my desk at the price of $35 ea.My one complaint is that it is very complicated to set up to auto answer in fax mode. I have Vonage so I suppose that complicates it more.At $149 is doesn't seem to be cheap.
1,A Nightmare!,"1) The driver/software package is as large as a small OS. Sometimes it will print, sometimes it will scan. Most times it will do neither. Many times I have had to reboot to make the damn thing work at all. The driver package takes forever to install. Save your money, I wish I had."
1,What a piece of crap,I've been trying to get this printer to work properly for two months. I've been to HPs on-line chat support twice and cleaned everything and repowered and done whatever they told me. (Just TRY and get warranty service. Hah! There's a hoot!) The dang thing still mangles every other sheet it tries to pick up when printing.I don't need these hassles. Neither do you. I'm shopping for a Canon now.
4,Smells Like a Rotten Fish.... 2 Stars at the Most...,"Works good but software is lousy. After I installed the included software/drivers it increased my PC/XP boot up time by one minute thirty-five seconds (1:35). First it hangs up on the ""Welcome"" screen for about 30 seconds then on the desktop screen for about 1:05. Looks like the HP software engineers really dropped the ball on this one. The software design team that wrote the drivers and programs for the 5510 must have never attempted anything like it before as they clearly didn't have a clue as to what the hell they were doing. The size of the installation files were 100mb for just the drivers and 1 gigabyte for the whole package. All that being said the machine actually prints/copies/scans/faxes pretty well. I just wish HP would fix the terrible boot up speed problem. I would give this puppy a 2 star rating at the most."
2,Do NOT buy this printer!,"It took hours to get this printer working on XP Pro. (I also installed it on XP Home and had no problem.) The software is terrible - at least half an hour to install, and it kept failing with a generic ""fatal error"" which gave you no idea what was being installed at the time. Then it would go through a slow process to delete everything it had installed and then I would have to start over. After tech support suggested I reinstall Windows XP, I gave up on them. Finally got it working after cleaning HP entries out of the registry.Then, a couple days later, when I tried to print labels, the labels would not feed right. An obvious hardware problem. But, support kept trying to convince me that it was a problem in Microsoft Word.So, I returned the printer and bought a Canon MP730 which I LOVE! Easy install, great quality, separate color cartridges. .... but twice the cost. Still, I wish I had just bought the Canon at the beginning."
2,What a PAIN this plastic BRICK is!,"I want to ship this to Carly Fiorina's office with a NOTE asking them to stop ruining the environment! it started to JAM relentlessly, and INTRACTABLY (after useless time-wasting calls to HP's lousy customer svc department). It feeds n prints one page, and then 1/4inch into the second page it HANGS. beep-beep-beep....beep-beep-beep...TIME AND TIME AGAIN. checked with other who has this printer...guess what...SAME PROBLEM.BUT...good luck trying to find it on any support FAQ.Pls contribute to the HP/Fiorina bonus stock-trust fund by buying it and apying through the nose for cartridges...each one with a unique number!P. O. S.NEVER HP Again."
5,Great little machine!,"WOW! For the money, this little printer-fax-scanner-copies is a real jewel and a workhorse. I've used mine for a lot of printing more than anything else, and it has never let me down. I recommend it to anyone.5/09 UPDATE -- this model and subsequent models are not recommended. I have sent this model and others they have sent as replacements at least 6 times in 2 years. There is a definite design problem in the sheet feeder."
1,HP No Longer Manufactures Quality Electronics,"I've always purchased HP printers and they have proven to be indestructable. Not so with respect to the printer/fax/scanner/copier combinations. This is the second HP fax, etc. that has failed me in less than 2 years. I purchased the second HP fax. etc., machine -- shame on me. The ink jets are ungodly expensive, the ink smudges, and the scanner is a little fuzzy. Sorry folks that I don't have a more positive review for you."
1,Died as soon as the warranty ran out.,Worked fine for 14 months though I always thought the build quality was poor. Paper jams are hard to clear and it stopped working with envelopes after a few months. As a previous reviewer noted HP will sell you an upgrade of a refurbished replacement at a special price if you send your broken machine back. Now I know where they get the refurbished machines. I'm switching to Canon.
4,Absolutely worth it,"Printers have gotten inexpensive. Let's face it; the game is, cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills. I'm fine with that.For the $149 Amazon price, this machine actually *does* do everything I need it to: a fax machine for those rare occasions I need to fax a physical piece of paper. A great inkject that doesn't consumer *that* much ink. It copies and scans. I have used every function, am pleased with them all.Sure, it feels a little flimsy; it is a small machine meant to do work that you are used to seeing a huge piece of hardware accommodate in a standard office. However, it has held up well to some serious use in the past couple months, so that flimsiness isn't really even a complaint. And I work from an office in my home three weeks out of each month, so I am more than glad I can reproduce all the functionality my ""real"" office provides me.All in all, worth the money."
3,Stay calm and look for a USB Cable,"I made 2 of the errors most commonly reported (a testament of the unfriendliness of the instruccions). At first, I loaded the paper on the up side of the tray. Must be loaded under the upper tray. After I went out and bought the USB cable needed but not included, everything was ok until the alignment page was printed and it was time to do the scanning. I put the page as the picture on the setup poster, down, and just like printed top to botton, the machine tell me ""error"". On desperation I turned the page botton to top, and it was ok. Good printer, awful installation and setup time. Wonder if mac users have the process so hard."
2,You get what you pay for,"My biggest beef is with the scanner. The copier and printer work fine. They're a little slow, but it's an inkjet, so I didn't expect much. The fax is great, probably the best feature in the bundle. But the scanner is hard to install and hard to operate.Also, paper jams are incredibly hard to clear compared with other printers/copiers."
2,Was ok for 6 months,"This printer was fine until I changed cartridges and a contact was dirty. Now it won't quit printing alignment pages all the time. I have about a million now, and its cost me a fortune in ink. Every 3 or 4 print jobs and I get another one.I've spent hours with technical support, who keep leading me through the same old song and dance, disconnect the usb cable, hit some buttons, print another page I don't need, and scan. Voila it works! Case finished.NO IT IS NOT.The tech support people don't speak English and it shows in their grammar and inability to understand that my problem seems to be a variant on what they have in their knowlege base.HP would do better to hire native English speakers. I'll never buy another HP printer.Oh, they print fine, that is, if you want a million alignment pages."
3,software is bulky and not XP compatible,"the device works fine but the software is a major pain in the butt. it took me a few days to get it working correctly (esp. the scanner). and i had to download the latest software from hp with is an amazing 354 megs!! unbelievable. now i've got it working, but the software is huge, memory intensive, and is generally a pain."
1,"Excellent at first, but then it just goes downhill","I loved this unit at first, but after a little over a year of ownership, I wish I didn't own it! The ADF has continuously given me problems. My current problem is that printing one page it taking 10-20 minutes!!!! I was on the phone with HP trying everything to fix it to no avail. They decided it needed physical service, which as another reviewer stated, would cost about as much as it would to just buy a new one. I'm buying a Konica color laser printer and a Canon laser fax machine. I'll also be buying a separate scanner. This all-in-one idea doesn't seem to work long term. This is also my 3rd HP printing machine in 2 years. I think their quality has gone completely downhill."
3,Lost driver- help!,Good printer... but... I lost the driver CD and want to install to another computer. Please tell me where I can get the driver for Win 98 system. HP website says they don't have it. Thanks jpmacaroni-at-hotmail.com
5,Hercules Action Pack,"This pack provides a real sampling of the Hercules series, along with Xena and Young Hercules. If anyone has not seen these, this pack could very well get them hooked! The animated movie was entertaining as well, but I prefer the real thing. The only disappointment is the lack of chapter stops on the Hercules's Amazon Women and Lost Kingdom DVD, and the Xena Trilogy DVD. Using the fast forward is inconvenient, but does not detract from the stories!"
2,Needs More Description,"Kevin Sorbo made five Hercules Movies before the series was started.the circle of fire, the amazon women, the lost kingdom, in the maze of the minotor and hercules in the underworld.this package includes a cartoon and Hercules and Xena episodes. I would not recommend spending money on this package if you want the five movies."
2,This is so not cool,"What a gyp! It mentions having ""Young Hercules"", and in the movies summary it says that it stars Ryan Gosling who played Young Hercules in the television show, which is why for a minute I thought they'd *finally* put ""Young Hercules"" the tv series on DVD. But the series was not 93 min long in total (as mentioned in DVD features), and the picture leads me to conclude that the ""Young Hercules"" in this pack is the movie, not the television show, and that was starring Ian Bohen, NOT Ryan Gosling.Other than that typo that got my hopes up before dashing them against the rocks, I guess it's a pretty good pack to get, unless you're planning to get the first season of ""Hercules:TLJ"" on DVD, 'cause the movies are on there too, and then just getting ""Young Hercules"" by itself."
2,Too political,"I bought this book hoping to get some good info on solar power. So far it appears to be more political than actual information. As I finish the book hopefully I will get more information that I can use to become a solar producer for my own home. I live in the northern hemisphere (Oregon, USA) so am not sure how effective it will be here.I have an acquaintance living in a village in Mozambique who has built a houes that is solar powered. They have solar lights and power for the computer and electronic keyboard. They also have a solar submurseable pump for water that has caused some problems. It may have been the splice in the wiring. Would like more info to possibly help the other people in the village take advantage of solar power."
4,Theroux! Love him or hate him,"I happen to enjoy Paul Theroux a lot of the time, and this ""fictional autobiography"" delivers the goods. As usual, Theroux goes over familiar territory, Africa, Singapore, London and Massachussets, and makes one wonder which of his stories are real and which aren't. My favourite chapters in this book are his encounter with the royals at a posh function, (especially his Prince Phillip moment) and his pilgrimage to his hometown of Medford Massachussets, slumming with some locals who wouldn't know one of his books if it hit them on the head.This is as good introduction to this author as any book, although one would do well to start off with one of his travel books, such as The Old Patagonian Express (which is where I discovered Theroux). I found My Other Life to be much more enjoyable and substantial than his somewhat self-pitying My Secret History, written a few years previously. In fact I should re-read My Other Life soon, each page has some gems."
4,Insight and entertainment--what else can you ask for,"Theroux's fiction, while entertaining, often has lacked the intense obervation and insight of his travel books. This one has insight a-plenty"
3,"He Might *Say* It's Not *Him*, But...","But only in a post-structuralist sort of way. The self-consciousness makes this otherwise finely-written book uneven; it's a collection of memoir essays collected in a pastiche, actually, Theroux's version of *The Benny Poda Years* (or vice-versa). And after a while, one grows a little tired of the ""fiction"" pose in BOTH narrators'lives--after all, autobiography itself has a lengthy and healthy legacy of inspiring the Reader's suspension of disbelief."
1,My review of : My Other Life,"I thought the first half to be boring, I was bored with the English characters he knew. I was ready to put it down half way through then it picked up with his separation from his wife. There were a few very insightful lines that made it worth the price of the book. "" a brillant writers ability to enter the readers soul"" and ""How did they do it?"" also I knew what few readers knew, that you had to be that particular writer in order to write that particular book. I was very impressed with these two lines, something I always felt but I couldn't put into words."
3,Looks like a catalog.,"The book is good, but there're many cars wich aren't real sportscars, only tuned cars and kits. The book hasn't too much technical info, and sometimes 3rd level manufacters (Ginetta) have the same consideration as Porsche or Lancia. There's lack of color photos. But the book is fine and entertaining."
3,Hoping for Specifications with the car listings,Didn't have much statistical information. The general coverage of sports cars was great. I had no way to compare the information regarding all the vehicles. I guess I just wanted to much.
5,Great Resource,"I'd overlooked this resource before since it is somewhat dated. However, it is better than many more recent resources. In fact, much better."
5,Making your family business formidable...,"Partly a story about a fictional family, partly instructional, The $urvival Guide has been very useful to me as a family business member. Mr. Le Van's 39 questions are a wonderful tool for finding out where your family is, and where it should be going. There will be some work involved, but if you'd like for your business family to become healthier and more successful, this is a great book to start with.Then there is a really fun and instructive sequel named ""Families Money and Trouble"" that takes the same fictional family into the next generation."
2,lovely but too small,"I really like the looks of this bag and thought the dimensions would be perfect when looking on the web site, but it was much too small for my day to day activities, so had to return it. Loved the material and would love to own one in larger sized."
5,Disciplines of the Spirit,"The ""Souper"" Book Group at Emmanuel UCC in Sebring, Florida read and discussed Thurman's book, Disciplines of the Spirit. We found it to be a ""read"" and ""reread"" book. To gain the most from his deeply spiritual presentation the reader needs to do a fast read-through and then a line-by-line study with note taking. A healthy and interesting discussion was enjoyed by our entire group. If you want to grow spiritually, we highly recommend this book."
5,A Lost Cinematic Masterpiece,"I saw Wifemistress in its cinematic release years ago, and I still remember the wit, acting, beautiful cinematography, and evocative musical soundtrack of this ensemble film featuring Mastroianni and Antonelli at the peaks of their craft. The film is romantic, amusing, and engaging, and makes for a wonderful evening watching it with one's significant other. This film begs for restoration and re-release in its complete European release version on Blu-ray by Criterion."
4,Another Classic by the Great Dr.!,"This book was the second in a proposed ""trilogy"" of Hunter S. Thompson's personal letters. This book continues were the Proud Highway left off.Where did that leave off, well it was 1968 and Nixon was slowly becoming one of Hunter's people to pick on. This volume of letters were just as good as the 1st volume if not better! He writes to KREX TV in Grand Junction and complains about their programming or lack there of, and that was in 1968 and I want to do that myself here in 2001! He also writes Senators, Presidents, and Editors! We learn about his attempt to become Sheriff of Pitikin County on the ""freak power ticket,"" whether or not Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was fiction or real!All in all this book is great and anyone who likes Thompson should pick this one up and prepare to never put it down until you are done! I have to go and read his column on ESPN.com page 2 that is posted every Monday, titled Hey Rube!"
5,Prophetic,"Rather than go on about the good doctor's ""twisted"" or ""demented"" genious, which is well documented (and definitely warranted), I will only say that I find his social and politcal insight amazingly accurate. His social commentary is as valuable today as it was to friends and collegues in the late sixties/early seveties. Other than some choice letters to fans and associated ""enemies"", the rant about the Duke is my favorite, as it says the most about a large part of US culture."
3,Background reading needed,I'm sure this would be interesting if I had read more of Thompson's books before this one. It does fill out a portrait of a man that rings true with his reputation.
5,"Sometimes choppy, but it is also brilliant like HST","Hunter S. Thompson's book here is really a collection of letters he wrote to various people, some in the literary business, to friends, family, some fans, etc. On how much you like the book depends on how you follow the letters' paths, but Thompson die hards (like myself) will find some interest here, in particular with his correspondence with Oscar ""Dr. Gonzo"" Zeta-Acosta with his letters also included making their segments worth the buy alone."
5,FEAR AND LOATHING IN AMERICA,"THE MORE I READ THIS BOOK, THE MORE CLEAR THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM IS."
5,Granddaughter sees the Titanic,My granddaughter became interested in the Titanic with TV movies and with my going on a cruise this past year. So I ordered Inside the Titanic for her. She was really impressed with the cutaway pages and being able to see inside the decks. She really wants to go on a cruise now (except not on the Titanic!).
3,Disappointing Inside Study,"Yes, the book is big if you measure the cover, but the substance was disappointing. Titanic was the largest moving man-made structure when it was built and I wanted to see more of that structure; how it was designed, how it was built, how it worked. The book contains nice cartoon drawings of people standing various places, with stories about their circumstances."
4,Giant Cut-away Book,"It was a very interesting book. As the title indicates, it shows numerous cut-away pictures of the inside of the Titanic. It was nice to see where dining rooms, sitting rooms, the gym, the pool, etc were in relation to each other and the cabins and state rooms of the passengers. Good book for middle school aged children."
4,Visual Eye Candy,"This is big hardcover cutaway picture book about Titanic geared for young children. It is well thought out primer book with just enough details and cutaway drawings to make readers, both young and old, to make them want know more about this magnificent ship that lasted only couple of days in its maiden voyage.With that said, I kind of wished the book could have little more cutaway drawings that show closer up details of ships interior. :)"
5,The Birth of the Next Movie Legend,"Once again Kaya Savas and company have taken us all on a adventerous ride of mythic proportions. A tale of lust, love and intrigue, this movie has it ALL. A whirlwind of adventure from start to finish, I could not put my laptop down, but had to watch the entire movie through without getting up TWICE. I had always wondered what I would put on my gravestone when I died, now I know. A 30 inch flat screen TV with this movie playing in an infinite loop so that all the ages of man are allowed to bask in the reflective glory that is a Sincere Prospect. Bravo Mr. Savas, Bravo!"
1,it does not work,this came in a box with all the right paperwork. unfortunately is did not work. There is a spring just lying in the bottom of it and 2 rubber parts that probably should be attached to something but I do not know what.I am not happy with this product.
1,I hate this HP PSC 1350 PSC!,"I have had this printer for 3 years, and when it works it does just fine...When It Works...rarely!I consistantly get an error msg stating my paper is jammed when it clearly is not, it resets and resets and resetsover an over and over again when all I want it to do is scan or print or copy. The ink is expensive and when itdoes manage to work it is so loud and clunky that it shakes my whole desk. I cant wait to find another printerthat actually works, when I do, I honestly will throw this one out of the window!"
3,Noise Concerns,I had no problem installing this printer. The picture scans came out fine; the picture prints came out great; haven't tried the copier. My main concern is the noisiness. It makes a lot of loud clicks between prints. I will be exchanging it for another one of the same model to see if it is the model or this particular printer with a problem.
2,"Laborious software, grainy scans.","I'm using Mac OS X and find this printer's software anything but user friendly, especially compared to my older, cheaper Lexmark, which also scanned better. This unit's scans are okay for text, but I can't use them for photos that I want to show people. The print quality is outstanding with the purchase of the uber-expensive photo cartridge, but you're better off buying an HP printer and a separate scanner, because this one is a pain. The card reader is brilliant however, with seamless integration into the OS."
3,Great size!,"I purchased this to replace another similar printer that uses the same cartridges, simply because I had new cartridges when the other printer died. The printer is nice and compact, I love the size. The print quality is not too great, but is fine for everyday stuff, not so great for pictures. I spent more on the cartridges than the printer so it's fine."
5,"For the price, best all in one you can find.","I bought this All-in-One when I purchased a digital camera, because I knew I'd be needed advanced printing cabilities and my old printer just wouldn't cut it. HP had a well-deserved reputation in printing and imaging, and this didn't disappoint.For the price, I've found the quality to be really what I've come to expect from HP printers. Colors are sharp, crisp, and the copying quality is above what I'd expect.(it's not for use on mass-quantity copying, but hey, for a single doc or coupla pages, does a fine job) I do recommend getting a USB cable with it, because the one I purchased did not include that, but that was the only real 'glitch' I found in purchase.All in all, if you want a quality printer at a reasonable price, you can't beat this model."
4,"Great printer, but beware the ink prices!","I was thrilled to find a multifunctional printer for such a good price. It prints gorgeous photos even without the special photo ink, the scanner is the best I've used so far, the copier function is super easy to use, and the card reader was a nice surprise (I thought it was only for printing directly from a memory card - turns out you can use it to open files from the card on your computer). I haven't used the proof-sheet function yet so I can't comment on that.I only have two gripes with it: 1. the top of the scanner doesn't come off - this would make it a lot easier to scan/copy book pages or other things that aren't completely flat or are larger than the scanner itself; 2. The ink costs a small fortune! Even at a military exchange store, where prices are usually pretty low, it's $25 for black, $35 for color. I guess that's how they make up for the low price of the printer itself!Overall, though, it's such a great item that I had to give it 4 stars."
4,Nice performance in a small package,"The PSC 1350 is a small printer that does most things quite well. I especially like the photo proof sheet feature that allows you to preview all the shots on your cameras media card, color in the circles below the ones that you want to print, pick out the size and features, scan the sheet and wait for your customized pictures to print. Very easy to use and the quality is quite good."
4,capable printer,"Out of the box this is a good looking, small, multifunctional printerThe software took an extremely long time to load. It spun my cd-player the slowest it has ever gone, crawling to occasionally stopping. You'd think that people who were smart enough to design this could hire some good software writers.The scanner ran well when I scanned the test page that automatically came out of it. Haven't tried scanning photos yet but I think it will be good enough for what I do with them.Prints very nicely and quickly. Not that noisy either except for a grinding noise at the end of a scan that someone else I think has mentioned. I hated my Lexmark from the moment I got it for free with my Dell computer. Glad to get back to HP which I think are fairly bullet-proof."
1,terrible printer!,"Absolutely horrible!! After installing and unistalling several times, I finally took it back to the store. Brought new one home..after two more times installing and reinstalling, got it working or so I thought. Prints when it wants to, not real good photo print quality, ok text documents. The software that comes with the printer sounds like a nice idea but more than half the time the pictures stop downloading (even with very small sizes and quantity) I will never purchase from hp again"
3,Great printer; not a very good scanner,"The HP PSC 1350 is an excellent color inkjet printer. Text and images are clear and vibrant.Unfortunately, the built-in flatbed scanner leaves much to be desired. Colors come out looking ""washed out"" or inaccurate. The images are blurry, and if you apply the built-in sharpening, the edges become jagged.Nevertheless, the scanner is good enough for making quick black & white copies like you would with a Xerox machine. Just don't expect it to be good enough for photographs. Get a real scanner for that."
1,Scanner stopped working,"My all in one has worked great for years. Now the scanner comes up not found. I can print and copy. But no matter what I do I can't get my computer to find the scanner. It's not the computer, it's the scanner. I see a lot of HP all in ones with the same problem on the HP blogs. I like to scan pics etc. Now I can't do any of that."
1,"Terribly slow scanner, horrible drivers/software","We purchased this printer for photo scanning and were not very impressed with the quality or the speed of scanning.Pros:1. Card reader on the front easily accessible2. Quick printing for text and high quality photo printing (not scanning)3. Sleek design and small footprint.Cons:1. Terrible drivers/software and very large installa. Windows wont load properly if printer is turned onb. Software freezes a lot and computer has to be restarted2. Scanner is very loud and slow3. Driver update software is annoying, too many pop-upsOverall I would never purchase this printer again or recommend it. We are switching to a Canon printer due to the drivers and sofware."
1,broken after 7 month,The printer was OK before the cartridge axis broke after 6 month of normal use. I am not expecting such poor build quality from HP. Very disppointed.
2,Never got to use it; software problems,"crashed my system, took four hours to install...unistall...install...unistall!HP, I love your products, but the software must of been designed on a friday, or a monday! BAD QUALITY!!!"
2,"HP PSC 1350 All in One Printer, Scannder, Copier",It did not work any better than my old printer so I wish to return it. How is that done????
1,Worse than useless,"This printer - apparently it was used - jams constantly, even after re-installing and buying new ink cartridges. I am sending it to the recycling center along with other obsolete or non-usable items from the office. What a waste of money and time. Lesson learned I guess."
1,"Terrible printer, please do not waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I purchased this printer for my son and have been nothing but dissapointed....this printer has stop working completely...I thought maybe it was out of ink and purchased new cartridges which was not cheap just to find out that it still would not work...I have never ever been so frustrated w/a printer. My daughter has a Lexmark and has had it for awhile and it works fine...I wish I would have invested my money in Lexmark instead of HP...but it sounded like a pretty good printer but boy was a wrong about that!
1,"Was Nice, Before it Broke","This was a nice product, until it stopped working, just after the warranty ran out, of course. It stopped reading the black ink cartridge, and it doesn't print at all without it."
1,No Printer Cable included!,How can they sell a computer and not include all parts needed to make it work -- where is the USB printer cable! It's late - stores are closed - and I'm stuck with a worthless piece of plastic next to my computer and documents I need to print. Give me a break HP! I guess the price of the printer is really $20 (for cable) more than advertised. Be aware!
1,Very Disappointed,"I always have found Hewlett Packard printers to work well, but this printer is the exception. To start, it doesn't come with a USB cable, so that adds more money onto the total. Second, it is extremely slow, much slower than the specifications say. My biggest complaint is that it will not print certain formats, such as powerpoint slides and some pdf files. Instead of text, it prints out those annoying little boxes. As a student whose lecturers use these slides, it is extremely disappointing not to be able to print them out at home. I can't tell you how much paper and ink this printer has wasted because of this problem. I have not had a problem with the copier or the scanner, but the printer part makes the whole thing not worth buying unless you're okay with just printing in select formats."
5,Why I like the HP 1350,"There are many things I like about this all in one printer, having used a number of them at one time or another. This all in one suits my needs very well. I do newsletters for my senior center and print a lot of photos. I am able to scan, copy and paste almost at the same time. We are relatively happy with the photo quality but sometimes there is streaking which may be the paper.Nathan D. Simmonsnatsim8@hotmail.com"
4,Great Little Machine,"I was never a big fan of inkjet printers, but when the salesman snapped my picture and then printed it out on photo paper - I was amazed. Even on plain paper the prints were unbelievable. Needless to say, I had him test just about every HP inkjet in the store and they all performed extremely well.I chose this model because I liked its small footprint for an all-in-one. The software takes a long time to load but is well made and works well with the unit. Although you don't even need a computer in order to print out your photos.Would have rated it 5 stars if the unit allowed you to print borderless 8x11's like the other HP stand alone printers. Very happy with my purchase."
5,Great for the money!!!,"Installing was painless. I don't know why so many people are complaining about the setup. It was super easy. You have to make sure you install the software before you plug the device in. It states this cleary on the instructions.The scanning is very simple to use. I think the quality is very good. Also, the copying is faster than I thought.How nice it is to have everything in one unit!The guy at the store warned me that it didn't come with a USB cable. I would have been very upset if I have got all the way home and I couldn't use it due to HP not including such a vital piece of equipment!I'm glad I didn't read the horror stories on this forum before I bought the 1350. I would have missed out on a great product for a great price."
3,"jack-of-three-trades, master of two","let me say this: if a scanner's what you're looking for, and you have the slightest bit of concern as to how your photos look once you scan them, you'd be well advised to look elsewhere.i bought the psc 1350 from a local retailer and was sorely disappointed in the scan quality. there is almost no dynamic range in the colors; the blacks are far too black and the whites are far too white, with little definition between. it's simply not a good scanner.if scanning is merely an afterthought for you, bear in mind that this machine pretty much does what it says; it's easy to set up and it prints and copies admirably. but if you're like me and intend to actually use the thing for all of its advertised functions, then you'll be bringing it back to the store within a week like i just did.good luck!"
4,Pretty good workout for intermediate/advanced exerciser.,"I picked this up at my local library looking for a decent cardio workout to do at home. Its not super challenging, but I broke a sweat and felt pretty good afterwards.Some things I liked: Some moves help build balance. The moves build muscle while being a good cardio workout.Things I didn't like: Warm up was too long. Some of the combo routines were too slow."
3,Maternal Instincts,"I give this movie 3 stars. Delta Burke plays a woman who is troubled by the idea that she may not be able to have children. She visits a fertility specialist to seek a cure. Dr. Eva Warden examines her and finds cancer in her overy. She consults her husband, who gives consent for a complete historectomy.Tracy wakes to find that her dream of a child is gone forever. Something in her mind snaps and she begins killing off the people involved one by one. Her last target is Dr. Warden herself. Using any plan she can, she is attempting to destroy her life and steal her baby.She even lures Dr. Wardens husband off on what he thinks is a job and plans to kill him.This is a pretty good edge-of-your-seat thriller that keeps you wondering what will happen next."
4,It was a really good movie,I really enjoyed the movie. The actors were exellent and the subject was really intresting. Beth Broderick played her role very good. It was just a great movie.
3,Indispensible Historic Work,"I've listened to the first half of this volume twice as an audio book and the second half once. Now, reading through the book allows me to highlight significant passages to use in teaching situations. Durant is both detailed and clear in his writing, making his work especially readable for lay-historians like myself.Nevertheless, he is an unbeliever and makes ""higher criticism"" arguments against the Bible, many of which have been dropped in the 70 years since Durant's publications due to new historical/sociological and especially archaeological evidence, which have confirmed the accuracy of the scriptures."
5,"A reader from Belgrade,Serbia,October 29,1999",This book is excelent ancient rome history book.It is impossible to be not impress.
4,"GOOD, BUT....","Stracynzski's first novel, which he admittedly wrote because he wanted to read a novel like this one, is a mixed blend of horror, Indian legend and paranoia. The charactes are pretty well developed, although Eric's is a little discombobulated at times; Liz is also a little opaque. However, once the novel gets going, and it takes a while, you're hooked on who is going to get possessed next, and how will Eric defeat the demons? I was disappointed at the ending in which the identity of the first through isn't revealed.However, it is reminiscent in ways of SALEM'S LOT and THE STAND, and is a very interesting novel."
3,Taut thriller,"Although formulaic (as is most horror), this one has the advantage of being written by Babylon 5's creator and primary writer. The result is a tightly-plotted thriller, with people given enough character to make them real. Set in a sleepy town in the Northeast, the main character turns out to be a guardian, with hints at the end of a much larger playing field. Like many quest novels, this guardian doesn't understand his heritage and must find it before he can turn the tide of the ancient evil. But he is no callow youth, but rather a mature man, confused and tormented by a talent he doesn't understand and can't control. The focus is on the people and how they react to the situation, rather than the evil itself. A better-than-average horror tale."
3,"Very enjoyable, but could have been so much more!","I love JMS's Spider-man and Supreme Power and Rising Stars comic books, and I definitely enjoyed reading his first book. However, I kept expecting a bigger payoff, a deeper story, and more engaging characters. The ""team"" that battled the demons were interesting, but I felt that they were very ""by the books."" What really would have hooked me was more insight into the demons that were hell-bent on taking over the town. Why exactly did they want this small little town in Maine? Who exactly was the head demon? And the ending was also a bit of a letdown. BUT, the novel had enough interesting ideas and cool fight scenes and dialogue that I'd definitely recommend it! I'd love to see what JMS could do now with a dark horror novel, after years of honing his craft!!"
3,Okay for a first try,"I bought this because I love Straczynski's comic book work, especially Midnight Nation. But the novel was slow and unimaginative. The characters are well developed, the dialogue is great, but the story just sort of flops about like a fish out of water, not knowing what to do next. The real meat of the story is between the priest and the demons, and even between the priest and the professor, but we're forced to read about some guy who has telekenetic powers and sees shadowy demons and blah blah blah. The priest story should have taken precedent. Still, he's a gifted writer and I've read a lot worse. For my money, pick up Midnight Nation, it's a much better romp through the world of the undead."
4,Great information,"Want to buy a home? This book will tell you why you should. Definitely biased towards home ownership, but for good reasons. Very informative and easy to read."
1,There are better...,"I read Eric Tyson's book and the best book on the market, 100 questions every first-time home buyer should ask...Both books were above average and superb, respectively. I read this book in between these other two books and was thoroughly disappointed. If you are looking at getting into buying and selling homes, then this book may be for you. There was a heavy focus on improving your home and then selling. If you look at the preface, the author tells you that he has moved quite a few times, which should give you a hint about the vibe of the book. He is interested in fixing up houses and selling. The whole book wasn't about this, but the info that didn't focus on this was not explained as well as either of the other two books noted above. Simply pass on this book or at least borrow it from the library so you don't waste your money."
2,Felt like I was in some sort of salesman seminar!,"This book just basically lists chapter after chapter everything that can go wrong ... when buying a house. Fine, that is the title after all, but I didn't find it very helpful. It seemed like a sales pitch to me somehow (how to get the best deal, etc). It isn't until the last chapter when they say the biggest mistake of all is ""being too afraid to buy because of fear of making a mistake."" Well, after reading that book how can one NOT be suddenly afraid of all that can go wrong???This book is definitely not good for newbies to the house-buying market. It just freaked us out way too much. A better book for newbies is BUY YOUR FIRST HOME by Robert Irwin. His was informative and reassuring somehow. It walks you through the facts without freaking you out about every possible thing that can go wrong, which I found much more helpful."
4,Great idea,"I liked the layout of the book, you can open any page and start reading about various mistakes and how you can avoid them. There are categories, and related items are grouped together. I would highly recommend this book."
5,The great equalizer plus fun to read,"Great book, fun to read. Really gives you the inside info to make sure your realtor, mortgage lender, and lawyer aren't taking you for a ride. I read four books on homebuying (Dummies, 100 Questions, Tips and Traps) and got more down-to-earth practical advice from 106 Mistakes than all the others combined. If you like real life examples instead of vague generalities, you'll find that this book delivers the advice you need. At least it did for us!"
3,"Good examples, but not enough follow through","I read this book in conjunction with ""Home Buying for Dummies"" and while it gave the better examples of what could go wrong - it did not give enough information on how to avoid and/or solve the errors.I really enjoyed reading the true life experiences other home buyers had. The book tells you what to look out for but it just did not give enough information on how to fix the problem. Maybe the next edition can expand more on the ""fix it"" portion."
5,Best book on homebuying(even for pros),"Even though we're experienced homebuyers(4 homes in 22 years), on the advice of a friend we bought this book and one of Eldred's other books. Both were full of information and tips that caused us to investigate our home purchase with far more detail. Having been burned twice in the past, we figured "" an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" We were not disappointed. We reccomend this book not only for first-time buyers, but also to ""pros"" like us who have realized that even serial homebuyers need to pay attention to potential mistakes that are all to easy to make."
3,"Good, but best as an adjunct.","Gary Eldred, The 106 Common Mistakes Home Buyers Make (Wiley, 2002)Reading this on the heels of Ilyce Glink's book may not have been a good idea, or it may have been a great one. I'm not sure yet. The two mostly cover the same ground, though Eldred never even brings up the possibility of buying a home without a realtor (Glink glosses over it), and Eldred does get into a little more detail about a few things. He also has a more cynical attitude towards the subject than Glink, but then looking at the books' titles alone should convey that well enough.A good adjunct, but not sure it would be as good a stand-alone tome; Eldred misses a few beats in telling you the options you have while he's too busy shutting the door on the options you should avoid. Best read in tandem with Glink. ***"
3,Not as good as I had hoped...,"Though the basic information was valuable (how to buy a home if you're cash poor, for instance, and the solid examples of how a home purchase creates wealth), I was disappointed in a significant portion of the book. The author makes recommendations (determine if selling prices in your neighborhood are going up or down, if the city you're buying in is in economic decline, what are the unemployment rates, etc. etc.) without ANY guidance as to where to find this information. This book purports to be for the novice homebuyer...and we novices need to know how to go about these tasks!"
5,Worth every penny!,"I was a total newbie regarding homebuying when I bought this book. It was fabulous, and I've never regretted the purchase. It explains everything you need to know, helps you to sidestep pitfalls that you may encounter and is in general, chockfull of useful information.It's easy to read and understand and went a long way toward calming my 'first homebuyer' jitters. I also brought HomeBuying for Dummies at the same time. Whatever I couldn't find in one book, I found in the other. If you're a first time homebuyer, GET THIS BOOK!"
3,not bad,"I cannot quite give this my strongest recommendation. In my opinion, Eldred exaggerates the value of leverage (being able to buy a large house with a small down payment).Part of my hesitancy may be that I tend to prefer books that take something other than the realtor perspective. Examples of books that I like are Randy Johnson's book on mortgages and Myron Ferguson's book on home construction, each of which delves deeply into a topic and is highly educational."
2,Grossly exaggerated!!!,"This book is written for the benefit of real estate agents. I am constantly irrated by the author bragging on how real estate would make money. Based on what? His calculations are seriously flawed to a point that it is not even funny. He assumes one does not need money to maintain his/her house - no money out.I did a simple calculation which assumes $180,000 house with 10% down and 3.25% property tax and 6.5% interest rate on 30 years term. The out of pocket money WITH tax credit will run you up to $1100. If you add lawn mow, cable, water, electricty etc., you know what I am talking about. This is the money down the drain. You house needs to appreciate at least 9% to just break even, and how can the author say 4% appreciation rate would make you money?I give it 3 stars because it does provide some good comments like priorities you need to list out before you buy. It is still a good read on many other topics. I just hope the author can save his sales pitch."
1,A Relic of the Housing Bubble,"This book was not at all what I expected. Instead of dispensing cautionary advice to help the buyer avoid pitfalls, the author devotes much of the book to the most irresponsible sort of encouragement to buy a house almost regardless of the buyer's circumstances. I suppose it may be of some academic interest to future historians documenting the mindset that led to the housing bubble and bust, it is certainly not of any use to anyone buying a house in 2012. I cannot understand why this book is still in print.I actually requested a refund from Amazon, which I rarely do. They promptly credited my account and didn't even want me to send the book back to them. I guess that pretty much says it all."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this thing. It leaked, which I stopped after much futzing with...only to have the electrical short out *externally* at the connector-wire junction due to internal partitional leakage.don't waste your time or money."
3,Good,"this has some great steps and good ideas; however, it'll take a while to get some of the more acrobatic things on here... have plenty of space, and have a partner near by to help with a few of the harder movements to make sure you don't hurt yourself"
3,"Breakdance, Step by Step -- It was okay!",I purchased this video to learn some steps to teach my students at school. I found the video's quality to be quite low and a little cheesy. Some of the steps were easy to pick up and others were difficult. My students got bored watching the movie 5 minutes into it. The pace was very slow.
5,Awesome,"This dvd is awesome, lots of guidance, very detailed, heaps of variation of footage, well explained. It has videos of breakdancing, popping and some hip hop. I recommend this dvd before you get any other breakdance dvd."
3,It is OK,"You will learn as much as being in an online breakdancing forum for at least an hour a day. The dvd has the explanations for the moves so that you do them the correct way, but it doesn't really help. If you really want to learn how to bboy look for friends who do it so they can teach you."
1,NOT SO GOOD,"This video looks amatuer in the way it was shot. It looks like it was filmed in someone's basement or backyard. Also, the language is so street I barely understood what they were saying (not everybody is a street kid english please!!). Very disappointed and definitley not worth the money!"
2,Decision on GOODTIMES,"DECISION AT SUNDOWN (1957) is one of Randy Scott's last great westerns. I really wanted this tape, especially as it had a giveaway price, but unfortunately the maunufacturer is GOODTIMES.They issued videos at slower tape speeds and without HiFi sound. Picture clarity of their product is always degraded, and unless your VCR's audio head is precisely aligned to GT's dubbing machines, the sound isn't all that clear either. Alas, alack and alarum!Despite there being no other available tape of this movie,my decision on GOODTIMES was.......... NO."
5,Easy peasy,The directions online were a snap. Only issue I had was with my owners manual and the layout of the fuses. Once I got that straight it worked like a charm.
5,Good unit for the price,"I got one of these about 3 months ago. Put it in my rack. It has worked perfectly.The load indicator is nice. It goes to full at 85% capacity, which is probably a good thing (to prevent you from looking only at it and adding more equipment).The software offers a logging feature, which is nice (no graph, though I suppose you could save it to a text file, and import it into a spreadsheet if you want).Only drawback is that, when you open the battery door to change the batteries there is a warning that the battery circuit is not isolated from the AC, and could be hot. Certainly made me shut it down before removing the batteries. This would make me wonder if it was hot swappable. (In my case I needed to relocate the unit in the rack by myself. So I wanted to remove the batteries so it would not be so heavy to fit into the rack. Since I was moving servers around I could shut them down too without issue.)"
4,Part two of an unfinished trilogy?,"Larissa would have been a fine stand alone novel. The parts dealing with Shade felt a bit forced. This was a good story with a slow start. Larissa becomes a more interesting character as the book goes on.In comparison with the previous book, Shade, this novel was simply better written."
4,Great collection,"A great collection of flying stories collected to span a period of aviation history in the far north. I enjoyed the book, and thought that the author did a good job of picking the stories to reflect not only humor, but some of the dangerous aspects of aviation. A very good collection and highly reccomended.Another good read of a seldom mentioned segment of Northern aviation is Flying North South East and West: Arctic to the Sahara"
1,There are better books available.,"This book has a lot of cute illustrations with Spanish dialogue, however, there is no translation given so if you don't already know Spanish, you wouldn't know what the Spanish words say. You cannot get the meaning from the pictures. I can't see how it would help you learn Spanish if you didn't already know it."
2,not impressed,"The frame looked good, but when I went to take it out of the box, I noticed several (all but two) of the fronts of the frames were falling off. I had to hot glue them back on before I could give the frame as a gift."
1,Disappointed,"Received the frame with multiple damages. Two of the flimsy metallic coverings had becomed unglued on arrival, and one of the glued frames was scratched. Since this was purchased as a Birthday gift, it was unacceptable for presentation. I have since tossed it into my garage, as it is not even worth the effort to repackage and return it. I expected better."
3,"Wonderful arrangement, cheaply assembled.....","This frame was exactly what we needed for our family pictures. Six families, three horizontal and three vertical. When the frame arrive both the packaging box and the original box were banged up during shipment. When the boxes were opened the frame looked flawless.....until we lifted out. The top frame is glued to the backing which is glued to each other......needless to say we had to glue it together instead of returning the item because it was a gift which was being presented two day later. It turned out beautifully."
4,Good product,I am very happy with the product and delivered in perfect condition. It has very rich look.
3,get Golden Unplugged instead if you must,"The quality is pretty bad on this. If you must have this unauthorized bootleg, get The Golden Unplugged album."
1,Stay away from this machine!,I am a computer consultant and have been asked by three different customers to install this device.IT ALWAYS FAILS!I normally recommend HP equipment due to their high quality and USUALLY good support.I now recommend ANYONE who wants one of these to look somewhere else.
1,Junk,"I have now decided that this is the last HP product I ever buy. Terrible software, doesn't work as it should. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
2,Poor software and tech support.,"If it wasn't for the update that HP automatically sent to me I would have given this printer 5 stars. Everything worked perfect until the update installed. Now I can't fax or scan from the computer. I have to print my stuff out and manually fax. I have to use the scan button on the device to scan. Also, I can't use the share driver on my other computer. I have to use the 990C driver. I have worked on PC's since they first came out and this one has me stumped. I removed every trace of HP from the registry and reinstalled the old driver, but it didn't help. HP tech support just has canned support lines, nobody seems to have solved this short of fdisk and reinstall WindowsXP. Their 4 level uninstall utility is a waste of time. Don't buy this unless you know how to turn automatic updates off. Other than that this thing prints, scans, faxes, and reads memory cards great."
5,HP products are great,"My computer came with a Lexmark printer,copier,scanner,fax machine.It was junk.I still have it brand new in the box.I got this HP machine and it's great!"
1,impossible to install on my pc,Three days spent trying to install this printer...AND IS NOT OVER !!! No help from the first level HP support which told me just to reinstall from a clean machine (WOW)!I'm going to give back this non functional product to the producer...maybe asking to my lawyer how to do it.Of course I suggest you all to buy another thing !!!
5,Amazing!!,"I'm a satisfied customer. This unit prints amazing photos and also works great as a great all-around printer, fax and copier. I love the way it prints from digital camera memory cards and I can view the photos on the unit's LCD before deciding to print. This product is easy to use even for a beginner like me."
1,Drivers destory a potentially useful product,"After having a customer bring her computer in 3 times due to the operating system having been corrupted, I discovered that she had been installing the drivers for this printer each time she took her newly repaired computer home. I attempted to do an install of the drivers myself, and found that the drivers cannot be installed independently of the software, and that the software is horridly bloated in terms of installation space and processor usage. I highly suggest looking to another manufacturer for a Printer / Scanner / Copier that will meet your needs."
1,Avoid at All Costs!,"Reasons to Avoid:1. After only 16 months of light use, hardware broke2. As it is out of warranty, HP will not replace, and furthermore can not even provide a local (Southern California) service center at which to have the unit fixed. Both the person-to-person and online support list businesses that explicitly do not fix all-in-one printers3. HP software does not play well with graphics, greeting card, or digital camera software4. HP software requires frequent reinstallations.5. Envelopes, in the majority of cases, do not feed straight into the printer, requiring multiple attempts to print an envelope"
4,Great printer! Just one flaw...,"One flaw: the paper type autodetect doesn't always work correctly, despite using HP paper. I finally figured out that manually selecting Normal paper fixes the s-l-o-w printing problem I was having. Another reviewer said he fixed this problem by uninstalling and reinstalling the HP software; that didn't work for me. I took off 1 star strictly for this flaw.Outside of that it's been a great printer. Installation was trivial on WinXP Pro SP1 (Athlon 64, lots of RAM and free disk space). It's soooo nice to have printing and scanning with only 1 USB cable and 1 power plug, not to mention 1-button copying. As always, make sure you've got all the Windows Updates installed before installing the HP software and temporarily disable your virus scanner."
3,Worked for a while,"This was a used product, so I didn't expect much. However, I had several PSC2410 printers, and wanted to make use of my stock of print cartridges. The printer worked when I bought it; however, it jammed up. I followed the printer instructions for ""unjamming"" - but it no long will feed paper without jamming. I use it as a FAX machine (that still works okay. I guess the lesson is - bite the bullet - buy a new printer (they also have more features, like WIFI)."
1,Still Unable to Use It,"I have now spent more than 20 hours installing, uninstalling, and working with HP tech support. I have almost 50 pages of technical instructions printed to guide me as I flounder through the process each time. To date, I have been unable to use this product, so I must rely on my old printer which, fortunately, I did not disconnnect. I think the programmers who wrote the install disc should be jailed. But I have friends who have been able to install this piece of junk, and I am determined that if they can do it, I can do. I'll keep you posted."
1,Not very impressive,"I have used this printer moderately for about the last six months and then last week, it just stopped functioning as a printer. It would still copy, but that was it.I spent considerable time on the phone with HP and they finally agreed to send me a new one (it arrived within 24 hours).I doubt this one will hold up any better by the way it sounds. I would recommend avoiding this product."
3,Difficult installation,"Very nice ergonomics -- e.g. small footprint. Difficult installation, at least for XP Home. Very poor power management. Can't comment (yet) on print quality and performance. Regarding the installation, the device appears to the computer as multiple USB devices (memory cards, printer, scanner, fax, etc.), and you must install the drivers for each of these. The installation instructions do not state this. Regarding power management, unlike my Canon printer, there is no way to configure the HP to power on when a document is printed and to automatically power off along with the computer."
4,Awesome photoprinter!,"With my Sony 7.2 the HP 2410 rocks as a photoprinter! As a copier, halftones and grayscales come in remarkably well. It's a bit slow, but the photo-quality more than makes up for it. It's been very reliable except for occasionally dropping faxes. We've been more than satisfied for the price...TWO THUMBS UP!"
5,I just loved it !!!,"I just bought this printer today and I loved it. I did not have any problem installing it as others might have. The printer produces great quality photo as well as color copy. I haven't tried the fax yet. So far, I just love it !"
1,Do not give your money away,"I would give -5 to this printer but the minimum is 1. I've had this printer for 4 years and trust me, I have printed no more than 100 pages. Once I tried to uninstall the software and there was not way to do so. I had to download a file from HP online and then I could remove the software. When I wanted to install the software again, because I needed, I put the CD on the CD Room and it started giving me a ""fatal error"". I went to the HP web site and downloaded the setup from there. After I installed it, my PC was pretty slow and giving me errors. I wanted to do a system undo and I found that the HP software was updating every day and changed my PC configuration. Then, the printer started asking me to replace the ink. I replace it and installed the software again (thirst time) and now what it prints are codes and errors. ENOUGH!. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY on something like this printer. Sadly it still is on my desk, meaning that this story hasn't finish."
1,Beware this machine,"I only gave this 1 star because the review requires a star for publishing, 1 is too much.I've never written a complaint or a review until I had the misfortune to purchase this machine. I am a HP user, this being my 6th HP printer. I have it about 6 weeks, to give it a chance because I wanted HP, but found myself so frustrated with it by day 2 that I wrote to HP then... I still have not had a reply from them.The software is too large and there is no option to just use the drivers. I find the color isn't up to my other 2 HP printer standards (720C and 1220C), it being quite dull in comparison, and the speed is 0 - sluggish. I timed my first print run and cried and that was using fastNormal. Also, for some reason it would occassionally only print 3 or 10 copies if asked for more (example 70+), not a reliable machine.I have no solutions but had to get this off my chest - buy something ""anything"" else. I love my 1220C but will be moving to another brand now, goodbye HP."
2,Just Read Psalms,"I was very bored with this devotional. I had read Psalms several times and thought this was a great way to dig deeper into the meaning of the individual Psalms. Although the author included some great additional information regarding things such as who wrote the psalm, place it was written, meaning of certain words, circumstances in which it was written, etc, the devotional apsect of it I fould child-like. The questions were not in the least bit thought provoking, rather it was more like filling up space. The daily study begins with asking you to circle certain words that appear over and over throughout that day's Psalm, so you find yourself more concerned with finding the hidden words than you are in understanding what God is trying to show you through the word. I was actually somewhat relieved when the 30 days were over. I reccomend that you just read Psalms, and don't bother with the study."
4,Good Food,"Perfect for daily private study or with a small group. We're using this book in Sunday School. Each lesson takes one Psalm and makes it a nice, easy-to-digest spiritual meal. Each lesson takes one of 30 Psalms apart. For each study Psalm, the questions explore what it says, what is means, how to apply it to our daily lives, and how to praise God and pray specifically. The Psalm comes alive and becomes relevant to current struggles and blessings."
4,Great Guidance,"I found this book to be really helpful in guiding me through the Psalms. It helped me to apply the Bible to my own life. I love to journal and writing things down helps me remember them longer so this book was perfect for me. It was a great introduction to the Psalms that I have never read before. The author encourages you to let God speak to you and to take out of your time in this devotional what He wants to teach You. There are a lot of questions so those who don't like to write probably would not care for this book. It also requires a lot of thought so those looking for a ""quick devotional"" would probably not care for this either."
5,great personal or group study,"this Bible study is perfect for anyone looking for lasting peace. i amhoping she writes a sequel, i believe several people will benefit from this book"
2,Disappointing,If I could have seen book in person I would have realized it was not what I wanted... Mostly just questions. I thought it would give more teaching.
5,Wonderfully Epic,"It's hard to find a proper word to describe this great piece of literature, but I guess it can be just placed as EPIC.It is truly wonderful, one of my favorite since I was younger, so no question I had to have it in my Kindle.A MUST READ TO ANYONE"
5,Mr. Lincoln's Kind Way,Ms. Whitlock's Third Grade ClassMr. Lincoln tries to help Eugene from bullying other people. Eugene was interested in birds and Mr. Lincoln talks to him. Mr. Lincoln wants to help children. Eugene's father tells him not to be nice to other people. Eugene is a racist.The book is very interesting; you should read it.
3,Just what I needed,"This is just what I needed for my auto adapter. This is packaged in the white ""iPod"" line, but the cable is not white. I was disappointed in that.However, appearances aside, it works well."
5,Perfect reading lamp,"This lamp is a great buy for the money. The base is very heavy and sturdy. I've gone through 3 different lights trying to find a good reading lamp that won't light up the rest of the room and disturb my husband. This one is high enough to set next to the couch, takes normal bulbs so I don't have to spend $25 on a replacement like another lamp I tried. Plus it looks great!Nearly three years later and The lamp suddenly started tilting. I've had to take it down because the bottom pole has separated from the base somehow. I loved the lamp up till this point, but I'm disappointed that it has broken like this."
2,Not terrible,...but not nearly as good as the taffy from Scott's Cakes available on this site. Next time I will be re-ordering the latter.
4,"Great taste, odd colors.","Taffy had a good taste, texture, and size. My only semi-complaint was that I was hoping that the colors/flavors would be traditional and they weren't. Pic looked like normal taffy, product had a more tropical color scheme. Used these as a wedding favor in a paper bag, so I doubt any one noticed."
1,Bores my 3-year old,"This DVD is just a hodgepodge of songs from other discs. I presumed that it would at least have a storyline, because the cover appears to show an ""American Idol""-like stage. Not a bit of it. There is not even a pretext of a storyline. Each song is about 30 seconds long, and they are just strung together back to back.Very disappointing. Avoid this one."
2,Disappointed with Amazon on this one!,"My daughters (11 to 4) love Dora and we have about 15 Dora DVDs, but I was highly disappointed when I popped in this one for my kids. If I would have known it was going to be a recap of songs instead of the usual adventure that happens, I would've steered clear of this title. Thanks Amazon for dropping the ball on the Product Description for this DVD when I ordered it, and 2 months later there is still nothing that describes this as a rehash of past songs. I wouldn't recommend this if your kids are Dora fans because it is not what they are used to."
4,Great CD!,My 5 year old and 3 year old both love watching Dora and singing along. Great cd for children who like Dora and love to sing. It is a big hit in our house!
2,Not pleased,"I like the product; I've used it for years. However, I thought I was ordering 3 items (my mistake, I guess). The item weighed 5.2 oz, cost $2.99, but I was charged $11.45 for shipping (US Postal Service). I think that is excessive--just a sneaky way to double the price!"
3,Not the best product on the market,"Despite being an Aussie product, and very inexpensive, there are much better products on the market, that make this particular one ineffective.I've tried it on dry hair, I've tried it on wet hair.It doesn't seem to do too much, versus it's claims.Redken is much better - see smooth down, particularly if you are planning on leaving this in.The key to not having frizzy hair, is really to lower the ph.This product is not ph balanced in the right direction to directly effect the cuticle. It depends on oils and silicones to weigh the hair down.Thumbs down."
3,Nice but not my favorite...,"My favorite part is the smell, its light but very nice. The cream is very thick making it hard to distribute evenly, but it does seem to work to avoid the frizz. I still prefer the liquid type better, even citre-shine. But for that price and a nice result, it's worth trying."
1,this was the worst,This was the worst example I have ever come across.I'm a college student and this set of books is what we have been using in english to brush up on grammer. As you may notice mine is still awful. My entire class is extreamy frustrated and highly dissapointed with this poor excuse of a tex/work book.I think it is wort nothing more than 0 stars!!!
5,Calphalon One Infused Anodized Saucepan with Lid,Gave it to my mother for Christmas. She loves it. Mom got rid of other pans of similar size -- she uses this one exclusively.
4,Onyl two things are in the way of this one getting 5 stars...,"First, this is a double CD, and all the tracks would have very easily fit on a single disc. Second, it's missing his razor sharp early 70s remake of ""Chantilly Lace"" in which the Killer asks ""How 'bout you pick ME up at 8 and don't be late?"" Other than that...original recordings are here and that beats the pants off so many other collections where new re-recorded versions are substituted for the originals...other than that, to quote the title of one of is other albums: all Killer...no filler."
4,Great espionage thriller. Full of intrigue and double agents,"This is one slick & smart cold war thriller. There is intrigue, double agents, action, and an intelligent plot. The direction and soundtrack is very good, creating the proper environment for a very good cold war cloak and dagger ride. Edward Woodward is great in this movie and the characters are human and complexed. Good believable action. If you loved the old Bond movies classics you have to watch this one. The ending is unexpected. You really don't know what to expect and who will come out alive. The movie is set at the height of the Cold War with a an intelligence cat and mouse game between British Intelligence and the KGB. The movie starts quiately with the capture of a a KGB spy in London , and from there it just gets more and more intriguing. This a serious spy movie for the serious spy movie fan."
5,Hip Hop History,"This documentary is on point. Directed by GeeBee & if you don't know who that is, you should definitely watch this & peep game. It's fun to watch all the old footage of the Clan. The dedication for Ol' Dirty is dope & heartfelt. Plus, you get a few videos on the bonus features; Protect Ya Neck & Method Man (bootleg version)...if I remember correctly. A definite must-have in any Hip Hop head's collection."
3,Slight dissapointment,"Like most things lately from the WU, or Wu related...fairly shoddy product....I was hoping for an in depth documentary experience, and some rare footage...plenty of rare footage from the early days....but production values drop off early and even with decent interview candidates,Divinie Diggs being particularly vociferous, this was overall a very disapointing product...especialyl considering the sense that the maker is quite a fan. Maybe that was the problem.....needed to be a bit more objective, and the focus on ODB as being the sole reason for the 'downfall' of the group was a shallow analysis.....hopefully something better will come out late.r...not awful by any means, considering the dearth of similar product,, but definitely dissapointing."
3,Pretty Good Wu DVD,"I'm glad I bought this DVD. There's decent concert footage of the WU and some details that you might not be know about their story. The scenes discussing ODB were particularly moving and informative.According to Papa WU, Dirty actually set himself on fire while he was incarcerated so that he could be moved from general pop. to the mental ward.The intereviews were good and the quality of the DVD wasn't bad at all.Overall a good edition to my DVD library"
5,Great Time,This hammock is great. It fits two adults very comfortably. We have a lot of great times in here. Nice way to enjoy reading and just relaxing the outdoors. Easy to use.
1,Questionable Authority.,"Warning: Neither of the authors of this book as a degree in Naturopathic or Holistic medicine. This book is like advice from the neighbor lady. Take it for what its worth and consider the source. I read it and am glad I checked it from the library. Part of a good education is to always question the authority of those teaching or giving advice. Clearly, in this case it just isn't there."
4,Good book!,"This book is a horror about a 12 year old girl and she is supose to stop the darkness from destroying every thing.In this book a new enemy has emerged who is some angel girl/monster that all most killed the 12 year old's(sorry I forgot every one's name I read this book a year ago) father! Even though I'm in to cute shoujos a good horror never hurts!How ever I recomend this book for some one 13+ and older for some Languege,Violence, and Nudity( accullaly the only nudity in this book is that the angel/monster girl doesn't wear any cloths)."
2,Narrow mindedness at its best!,"As a black female, I was excited to finally read Michael Honey's book. However, it turned out to be a major disappointment. Honey's extremely slanted view skews history to the extent that most readers will be turned off by this work. Honey totally discounts the importance unions had in achieving equality for blacks, a major blunder according to any historian. While Honey has a great grasp of the English language, his book should not be counted on for accuracy. Readers will find, after researching other literature, Honey's arguments should not be repeated. Save yourself some time and pass on this book."
1,"Does not work, do not buy","I used Unique Septic System Digester, and Unique Drain Opener. After eight applications of the products, my drain is still clogged. I can only conclude that this product is a scam."
1,Onesided,This book does an excellent job at ignoring all the harm religion has brought us and instead contributes all the positive influences in our socio-economic and scientific development to religion. Which is quite ironic since until recently pretty much everyone was at least on the outside religious in a society that did not accept (nicely put) a different mindset.
4,"A collection of many of her best, not greatest songs","One of the truely dedicated and talented women in the music industry gave this cd some reasons to listen, but not treasure. Some of her best songs come from her original recordings."
2,Not a solution for all.,"I read this book in preparation for two speeches I had to do at university. Although what the book said (like adopting the communication orientation and not memorizing your speech) sounded really good and believable on paper, in reality, the book just did not work for me. I still got nervous during my speeches (I think in my case my subconscious or my nervous system is just too used to respond nervously to public speaking) and have since looked for other approaches to lower my nervousness. My mother also read the book and still got noticeably nervous during a speech she had to do. I don't think it is enough and more specific and intensive techniques are required to eliminate fear of public speaking for some people."
1,One of a Kind.....A Classic,"This book tells it how it is. With the helps I have overcome many of the fears of public speaking. I can preach with a confidence that I haven't had in many years.This book is a must in anyone's library as it shows that speaking is just conversation that has only one person speaking to a group of people.Buy this book, you will be thrilled at the outcome.Ed Thompson"
3,It is just perfect for the price I paid!,I received it in the mail about 2 weeks after I ordered it. The pages were a little crumpled from obviously being wet some time ago but overall I was satisfied. It was better than trying to buy it from the bookstore.
3,Good Book,"Different Dragons by Jean Little was a very good book. This easy read was about a boy named Ben who has to visit his Aunt Rose for a while. Ben is afraid of a lot of things, people, new places and dogs. Ben really hates dogs. Aunt Rose surpises Ben with a big dog. Ben is very scared of the nice dog. I won't tell you the ending. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that at some points it could get boring and it wasn't a very original story."
2,Disappointing Book,"This was the first WW2 book I read that I was not happy with. The previous reviews gave a false impression as to the content of the book, which was the original reason for my purchase. The book is nothing more than a ""directory"" of names of those personnel that served in the camps---no pictures at all! The photo section was not impressive, except for several photos of Auschwitz-Birkenau. This would probably be better advertised as a history reference book, don't expect anything more than cold, hard facts here."
1,I would better avoid these boots,"Bearpaw Womens Leather Cowgirl Boot - Style 635 WestinI do not like the boots. Despite of the fency look, they are of poor quality. The soles are copletely sleek, I felt slippery even on rug. And the leather feels like a paper. I returned them immediately, but the order cost me a lot sending them back and forth.Avoid buying the boots online."
4,great cowgirl boots,"I love these COW GIRL boots. The price was right, they are comfie and lots of compliments"
3,Look good,"I was pleased with the quality and look of the boots, but they really are not a good fit for me. I mostly wear them for show, and usually take them off and go around in stocking feet."
1,cute but I can't wear them,"These shoes are super cute, and they look really nice in my closet. Unfortunately, I can't possibly wear them. I even took them to be ""stretched,"" and they were stretched as much as possible, but they are still way too small. I wear size 10 but size 10 is usually slightly big on me, so I would say these definitely run small and better not buy them in size 10 if that is actually your size."
1,The Ultimate Beginner Acoustic Guitar,"This book just contained a minimum amount of information to get started playing acoustic guitar, a few chords and that's about it. I would sugest bying ""Guitar for Dummies"", which contains a lot more information and some songs to practice with. Bottom line don't waste your monney on this book."
3,Thought I Was Getting a Little More Than What I Got,"The book is a good book to start with but it came with a cd that isn't that helpful. I thought it would be a dvd, but it wasn't. It just seems like a dvd of the lessons would have been more practical and not a cd for a beginner."
3,not the tfo!!!,product arrived when it was supposed to but not the product they are advertising.. no were near as bright as the tfos are... spend a little more money and buy the tfos
4,Episodes Included,"Hi, this is a great DVD and includes this episodes:""Fairly OddBaby"" (TV Movie)""Mission: Responsible/Hairicane""""Open Wide And Say Aaagh!/OddPirates""""The Odd Squad/For Emergencies Only""""Land Before Timmy/Cheese & Crockers""""King Chang/The End of The Universe-ity""""Fairly Oddlympics"" (22-minute Episode)""Sooper Poof / Wishing Well""""Wishy Washy / Poof's Playdate"""
4,Made For TV,This was made for TV. If you keep that in mind and don't expect a full blown Hollywood production you will enjoy this film. Solid acting top to bottom.
2,Overrated,"Others seem to have enjoyed this movie, but I found it unwatchable. And I am intensely interested in the subject matter.Hard to believe this thing was made as recently as 1987. To me, it has the feel of a B-movie from the 1940s or even the 30s. Bad writing and bad acting. I admit that I lack that nostalgia thing when it comes to film -- I want my movies all to approach the modern standard of being convincing and realistic. I just have no taste for the hoaky and the contrived. And I expect actors to be nuanced in their performances, not like amateurs in a skit. It just looks very, very old and second rate even for something old. In my opinion, it is nowhere near as convincing or as appealing as, for example, ""The Waltons,"" which was a period drama depicting the same era. And they turned out Waltons episodes weekly without -- I am sure -- anything like the budget of this junk."
3,Ford,"Excellent movie. The only disappointment was the quality of the movie. It was very grainey, as if it were copied too many times."
2,Where's the history of Ford?,"If your a car guy and looking for some detail on the history of the Model T's development look elsewhere. I was expecting some time devoted to Ford's other cars before the T, like the model's K, N, R, and S but I saw none of that. To my mind all the joy of this man's career centered around his Model T. In this movie the Model T, which was developed after many months in the experimental room at Ford's factory, basically appears out of thin air. Henry's son Edsel Ford was a real gentleman who did an awful lot for the company but none of that comes through either. He is portrayed childlike when in reality he was a brilliant executive. This is Ford for a TV audience at the usual 8th grade level. All the good stuff is left out and all the sensationalism is left in. Edited severely and in better hands, with the inclusion of the brilliant job that Edsel's son Henry Ford II did, then maybe the Ford's would of had their due. Has any one American family accomplished more?"
3,Twists Funny on ear lobe.,Beautiful silver Daisy but the earring latch turns so you see the back of the earring rather than front. Kinda sticks out... I attached the earring to a French Hook and it lays nicer but looks a little rigged.
1,Poor research may mislead viewers,"It is unfortunate that the producers of this video did such poor research on the subject material. The unsuspecting viewer may be easily misled by the accusations made. An EXCELLENT (thoroughly researched & documented) response to this video has been published, entitled 'A Response to the Video: Seventh-day Adventism - The Spirit Behind the Church', by Bob Pickle. It is available on this website or at www.pickle-publishing.com. The truly serious seeker of Bible truth should acquaint himself with both sides of the story."
4,Good expose about neo-'christian' cult that poses as REAL religion,Jeremiah Films has done it again. Be sureto see their films about Mormon & JehovahSicknesses Cults as well! Should be shownto all children who may come into contactwith these sincerely misguided folkes!
2,Not one of Herbert's best,"Having read most of Herbert's works, I found Survivor lacking some of the elements that have attracted me towards his writing over the years. In Survivor, once again, you have a middle age male heroin. However, in this novel, things are a little abnormal as instead of trying to save the world from a supernatural phenomenon, he is searching for some kind of inner truth in why he was a survivor of a deadly plane crash. For its time (1976), the concept of the novel was original and reflecting back, I enjoyed the premise. However, I found reading the novel quite taxing and I struggled to finish it. If you enjoy Herbert, try reading the Fog, Shrine, or the Rats trilogy. I enjoyed these novels much more than Survivor."
2,Didn't like this one at all,"This was a disappointing horror novel by Herbert. Its about a demon on the loose after a plane crash. I didn't like the religious tint to the story and the demon wasn't scary either. Maybe one or two scenes were kinda scary in the whole book, thats it. Its a rather dull story actually. Try his other novels, such as ""Creed"" or ""The Rats"", those are much better."
1,misleading,"This book is full of inverted acronyms, such as USAD instead of USDA, and TRAP instead of TARP, . The author also uses language not found in the referance guide- some of the questions are misleading or wrongly worded or answered in the key. I would recommend caution."
2,Good sample questions but disappointed in overall value,I purchased this product to get some sample LEED-NC questions and study material in preparation for the LEED exam. The sample questions are helpful and I will definitely be using them to study. A large portion of the book is data charts which I felt were overpopulated and the quality of the print made them hard to read; I will not be using these at all due to format and readability. [...][...]
1,Study the Reference Guide Instead,"I agree with the other criticisms, i.e., typos, inverted acronyms, inaccuracies, etc. The book sample exam questions were riddled with poor ones. For example, it tested you on the ability to know Credit 4.2 with no title, whereas, the exam doesn't require you to memorize the credit number without a title. I did pass the test but, found the book to be a poor study guide. Instead, the Reference Guide is by far the most valuable aid. I used other practice exams and found them to be more helpful, and similar to the actual exam. As others have indicated, don't buy this book since the exam has changed."
1,LEED Exam Candidates Beware,"While this has been a useful study guide in the past, the LEED exam changed significantly on July 1, 2009. Anyone planning to sit for this exam should be aware that this material may no longer be as relevant."
2,There are far better guides for the price,"This guide is somewhat useful, but I can't understand why it has such a high overall rating. This marks the first time that I've been so disappointed with an Amazon.com rating, and thus the first review I've written.Here are some of the guide's shortcomings:1) It is merely a long set of charts and tables that contain the information from the LEED Reference Guide. This, followed by hundreds of mediocre sample questions. No exam tactics, study suggestions or mnemonics to speak of.2) It is riddled with typos, errors, and mistakes. Several answers for the practice questions are wrong, too.3) The practice questions are often too easy and there are no explanations for the answers given (although to its credit, it does direct you to the page in the Reference Guide that it refers to -- some of the page numbers, however, are misprints as well).4) It's expensive! I've found several other guides at comparable or cheaper prices (some are free) that are far more helpful."
1,Was this book even edited??? Author need to learn tech writing.,"The author has no technical writing skills what so ever. Information is grouped with no logical order. Headings don't match up with the information below. Information is repeated over and over. I feel like this book was written so the reader can understand what its like to have ADD.For some reason almost every sentence has a word or two underlined and in caps when they don't need to be.""The registration fee must be PAID on-line""""4. The third step is the project AWARD certification"" (and yes the third step is number 4 on his list COME ON!!!!!)There are spelling and grammar errors everywhere; he probably didn't realize that spell check doesn't check words that are all caps."
1,misspellings and emphasis on wrong material,"Misspellings and emphasis on wrong material. There was one code question (out of eighty)in the actual exam. The practice test at the end of LEEDPASS had one code question per every five. The book will mix up affirmative and negative statements, saying you should not do something when you really should."
4,One of the Best Books For Young Children on this Topic!,"My daughter (toddler) got this book for Christmas, and asks for us to read it again and again. She also enjoys looking at the beautiful illustrations all by herself.The book explains what every kindergarten student should know about the Presidency by using animals to grab the attention of young readers. It is not over simplified, leaving plenty of room for questions and looking up supplimental information.There are not a lot of resources for parents who have very young children interested in government. The books in this series are very age-appropriate and informative. Even if your child is not specifically interested in government, it is a good story with some beneficial information."
5,Best in class beginners Oracle 8i primer.,"Given that this book came out late in the product cycle for Oracle81 its no wonder that it is the best in class primer for sales people and dp professionals new to Oracle81. The examples ALL work and the style and presentation are easy to follow and are based on real world installation and development. The structure of and presentation of a development project from business requirement to application maintenance and tuning is a practice that other authors should be willing to adopt to add clarity and understanding to people new to the environment. It needs a CD for the examples. This book would be a great classroom text, especially if accompanied by a good reference manual. Thumbs up to Mr. Hotka."
1,Not a good buy,"I own every Oracle book that has been published in the last 5 yrs on Oracle. I am a Database Engineer. This book is a waste of money. The author (from quest software) should have at least provided a CD with the tools that he used throughout the book. I am big on tools that make my life easier, but to use third party tools is a waste of time. Oracle comes bundled with some fair tools, the rest you can download. I bought this book before I really looked at it, only to realize it added no value to the subject. As a seasoned Oracle veteran (10 yrs)...Don't waste the money...."
4,Feeding problem,"I have had the same problem with the toner but my toner lasted from Dec 27/04 until April 6/06.I replaced the toner and then I was back in business even though there was ink in the cartridge.I have been printing a lot of business cards of late and after doing about 50 through the front slot, the regular feed no longer works. I have no idea what is going on with this. The warning light comes on, I press the button and it does one more. It keeps printing one at a time. Not the fastest way to print 20 pages."
4,So Far So Good,"This printer is easy to install in XP, and is a bargain. I am concerned about Brother's reputation for failure after 1 year, and hope that they have corrected this defect with this model."
5,What a great find for quilters!!,"This book was purchased for the outlines needed to quilt my projects,It serves that purpose and offers a wide variety of designs, from easy to intricate.Many of these designs are able to be used for other crafts also."
3,Hand quilting patterns,"I was hoping for more instruction, but this is just what it says, hand quilting patterns. My copy was musty and old, but I did not pay much for it, so no real complaints."
4,Quilting patterns,"This is a good basic book for quilting patterns. It doesn't go much beyond traditional patterns, but it is definitely a good resource to have. Recommended."
5,Nothing but patters,Usefull book. Plenty of nice patterns. No text. Many may wish to copy them out of the book to larger formats. Very pleased.
2,Wish it was on removable sheets,"Nice heavy paper patterns, can be traced if needed. But I would have liked it better in some type of removable binding. I hate to destroy the book just to copy a page."
3,Only source that I've found on this topic,"Awfully wordy, but where else can you find out about pot hole repair or setting up a neighborhood road association? Skim the first chapter, and then get to the heavy duty stuff comparing methods of road repair and varied techniques for different problems. Useful for rural residents struggling with disintegrating driveways. Great charts and a glossary."
1,"Bad, sappy, boring, sexist, poorly written.....","If you like sappy, bodice ripping, poorly written romance novels then buy this book. But if your taste in reading is higher than books that feature Fabio look-alikes on the cover, then don't waste your time. It's also sexist. I don't appreciate authors who propagate the vision that the world is completely hostile to women, and that everything is a man's fault, which is apparently what the author thinks. I kept reading it hoping it would get better, but it didn't, then I decided to finish it just so I could write an effective review. It was so bad I returned it, and I never do that..."
1,Power supply faulty,"Built 11-2007...bought 2-2008...power supply failure 7-2009 after 17 months of very little and moderate use..Very dissapointed in obviously faulty manufacturing after seeing so many others with identical problems. I used to like Westinghouse products. Since they will not back up or fix, to hell with them."
1,Better Buy Extende Warranty Because Everyone is Having Power Issues,"Wouldn't suggest buying this monitor! After about 18 months with very limited use of the monitor, the power went off one night and that was it. Nothing else works and it is out of the 1 year warranty so Westinghouse won't do anything about it.Searched the internet and found a long list of customers that had experienced the very same problem that I had.BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,Poor reliability,"We purchased an sk-19h210s at Sams Club 14 months ago. The set has been used about an hour a day, we have very stable power and this unit was on a good quality surge protector. The tv recently stopped powering on (for a bit the LED pilot would light for 1 sec and then shutoff).If you have read all reviews here in Amazon you'll see that 50% of the reviewers are extremely unhappy with the reliability of this set.I have called WDE support and they said it could be a power convertor - there are no recalls or other customer sat programs. I am researching this and asked for a callback from a supervisor, to escalate the high failure rate complaint - and will report back.[............]Well - that is a pretty loose argument - but even if I am off by 90% - I paid far too much for the value of this Westinghouse appliance."
1,caution: do not buy a westinghouse tv!,"when my first westinghouse flatscreen tv lost audio, it took over 9 weeks to get a replacement refurb unit. the new unit promptly lost the picture.in the interim, the company has switched to a non-human farce of a ""customer support"" system. it's a telephone message that promises a response to email inquiries within 24 hours. well, i'm on 5 days and counting - no response to the web form, email or phone messages.still waiting for that response from westinghouse, as well as for tv #3.there are other brands out there, folks. don't go with westinghouse if you know what's good for you. it would be worth twice what i paid for the tv to have avoided dealing with westinghouse customer service, not to mention a whole series of non-functional televisions."
1,Garbage TV,"This unit just up and died, 1 year after I purchased it...cheap as Westinghouse is....they are not concerned with helping to fix it either....Good luck..."
1,TV power failed just after warranty expired,"Add me to the list of unhappy customers - the power on my set failed after 15 months, and as with most people, I hardly ever used this TV. I'm having it fixed at a Westinghouse-approved service shop for $150 (funny that Westinghouse said it should cost only $20-$50, but I couldn't find anyone to do it for that price). It seems to be a relatively simple fix (some sort of cap on the power supply board) so if you know anything about TVs, maybe you can do it yourself (some techie websites give the details on how to do it). As with most people, I called Westinghouse and they denied this is a problem, even though the internet is full of complaints and the repair shop said it is a real problem. This is the last time I will buy anything from Westinghouse."
1,Westinghouse SK-19H210s,"Our 19"" Westinghouse story is nmuch the same. Purchased for a guest room so was used lightly. Suddenly would not come on anymore with remote but then would turn on by itself. Seen where someone replaced a capacitor on the power supply to repair but other then that this set will be destined to become a boat anchor. Would not recommend this unit."
1,Short Life,Purchased this t.v. for our daughter to play her Wii on. The television only worked for about 13 months before dying. Sincerely disappointed.
1,dont buy this tv,this tv was a decent tv for my kids room at the begining but all of the suden within the year it stop working i contacted wh and they told me just to buy an other one because the repairs would be the same as buying one. if you want to buy a tv that only works for about year buy this tv.
1,Worst TV Ever.,Died right out of warranty. Power Supply Failure. Anyone heard of a way to fix it?So Angry.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE! Unit WILL break just outside of warranty.,"Purchased this TV in May 2008. In August 2009, power supply went toast. I should have done more research before purchasing this Westinghouse product. Therefore, I'm writing this to do all I can to warn everyone not to buy this TV. Do your research - you'll find many many others in the same situation as me.Avoid!!"
1,"Waste of money, poor reliability","My mom bought this TV new, and a little over 1 year later it would not turn on or make sound, other than a very quiet ticking noise coming from the internals. I tore the TV apart and found a bad capacitor on the power supply board (2200uF 10V DC). I got a high quality replacement cap for $2 and soldered it on, put the TV back together and it works fine. The picture color is very poor quality in my mind, but I am comparing it to a $2000 Samsung top of the line LCD TV. My advice is do not buy this TV, there is a 90% chance it will fail with the same problem."
1,DO NOT purchase this TV!,"I had this TV for exactly 10 days after the 1 year anniversary and it just stop working out of nowhere. TV was only used maybe 2 hours a day. I went online to see if anyone else had this problem, and found hundreds of complaints and lawsuits to Westinghouse as it appears not just this TV, but all of their TV's stop working in a period of 13-18 months. Please save your money. If you want to read some of the complaints, go to [...] and see for yourself.Repair costs more than what the TV did."
1,Run away!,"I paid over $300 for this TV just 15 months ago and it's already broken. Not just pining for the fjords, but dead! I wish I would have seen the other reviews before my purchase, but I figured the Westinghouse brand was a good bet."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV........,"Please go online and research this TV before you even consider buying it! There are 100's of very upset people like myself who has this piece of JUNK tv! My children received one each (2 bought) for Christmas and the first one died after 14 months (2 months after warranty)then the other died 2 months later. They both just died, screens went black and nothing, no sound, just nothing. I called Westinghouse and was told that they ""haven't had any complaints"" which was a LIE!! There are 100's of them online and people even thnking about a Class Act Lawsuit. Take my advice and DO NOT buy this tv unless you want to throw $250.00 away or in our case $500.00. I will NEVER buy WESTINGHOUSE again!"
1,Another lemon for the stack,"Westinghouse SK-19H210S 19-Inch LCD HDTVDO NOT BUY THIS SET, EVEN IF YOU ARE TEMPTED BY THE LOW PRICE!Mine lasted 1 year and 1 1/2 months, before going totally black. Since it's 1 1/2 months past the warranty period, there's nothing that can be done, other than out of warranty repair, if that will even work. This was a bedroom TV, the sound was lousy, but fine to go to sleep by. On the plus side....the Sleep timer did work well."
1,POS! - AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!,Died just after warranty expired. One star rating is one too many but it made me give it at least one.
1,Complete Trash. Stay away from Westinghouse.,This TV was turned on for less than an hour less than 10 times in the last year and a half. It will no longer turn on when the power button is pushed. Stay away from Westinghouse. Waste of several hundred dollars.
1,Died in 2 Years,"Don't waste your money. After 2 yrs., our Westinghouse SK-19H210S died. Same problem as other reviews. A product life of 2 yrs. for a TV is simply unacceptable. Our landfills are already overflowing with hazardous waste. Westinghouse used to be a trusted brand name. Not so anymore. We'll never buy another Westinghouse product of any kind."
1,Stay away at all costs,After 6 months of use the power supply started having troubles. You would have to un-plug from wall about 4-5 times before the TV would turn on. Soon after the speakers stopped working so we ended up plugging in powered PC speakers to the line-out.Read many reviews stating the same power supply issue.
1,Expect short life span,"Bought this model less than 3 years ago; moderate use in my home office. It just began acting up this week when the blue front light would come on but no picture... several attempts to power cycle and try again was usually successful after 2 -15 tries....but kept getting longer and longer between successes. Tried multiple inputs but even the on-screen menu wouldn't appear during this time. Sometimes I'd get a quick white flash, then nothing. Westinghouse customer service on-line was not much help... looks like its ready for the recycle heap. I expected at least 5 years from this unit."
1,Dead,"This unit was purchased at Sams. After about fifteen months of occasional use in the kitchen the unit wll not turn on. Dead as a door nail. I haven't contacted Westinghouse yet, but I'm not hopeful that they will stand behind it since the warranty expired two months ago.Also, from day one, any time the power blinked, the unit would turn on all by itself."
1,buyer beware,"This product died about 3 weeks after the warranty ended. The power supply died, and the estimated cost to repair is about 225-250 dollars. This seems to be a common problem."
1,Failed after 14 Months,"After fourteen months of VERY light use in the kitchen the unit wll not turn on. Dead as a door nail. I haven't contacted Westinghouse yet, but I'm not hopeful that they will stand behind it since the warranty expired two months ago."
1,Bad HDMI,I bought this at Target and after 60 days I tried to hook up my blu ray player via HDMI. It never would work and so I sent it back to Westinghouse and got a refurb in return with dead pixels and a scratched screen. I sent it back again and got another refurb in o.k. shape and it still has the same HDMI issue as others have mentioned on forums. You have to turn off your player and back on 4-5 times just to get a picture via the HDMI. Very dissatisfied with Westinghouse's poor customer service and products. I would give it 1/2 star if possible
1,Do Not Buy This TV,"After the warranty expires the tv goes dead. It took mine about 2 months after it expired. Here's how it happenes...TV is turned on; I try scrolling up a couple of channels; TV freezes; All of a sudden remote isn't working; I try pressing buttons on the TV itself which gives me the same result; Unplug and try to turn back on = dead. We have only used this thing in the winter months in our downstairs. After reading some reviews it seems that this is the common issue with this product. If you want to get rid of $250 fast, just take your money and throw it out your window. I will never again buy a product with the name Westinghouse on it. Westinghouse = Junk"
3,you get what you pay for,"GOOD -- PRICE, BI-PLATFORMED FOR TV AND COMPUTERBAD -- NOT TRUE 16:9 (16:10), ACCESS TO DIGITAL QAM DIFFICULT, VIDEO AND AUDIO MEDIOCREFor a cheap utility hdtv that can double as a vga plugged computer screen (or visaversa) as in a home office, this screen is a really good deal for the money. However pix and audio quality only mediorce and the viewing range on the lcd limited.16:10 slightly distorts hdtv pix, elongating images by 10%.CAUTION: You can not key-in digital channels directly on the remote, even though it has a dot key.The only access to Qam digital is via on screen menu and then you can only access channels directly through the onscreen programming guide. Lots of key strokes. NOTE QAM is important, since it allows access to local HDVD channels without renting a box from cable or satellite."
1,Piece of crap,"As all the other posters who had it fail at about 14 months - ours just bit the dust. At first it would turn itself on at random times, then it wouldn't shut off, now it's finally just dead - won't turn on.I'll likely replace the capacitor that is causing the problem - it's well documented and I have the needed skills and tools - but it's disappointing to say the least. Westinghouse used to have a motto of ""You can be SURE if it's Westinghouse"" (referring undoubtably to the 55 year old refrigerator I keep my beer in) - now you can be sure that it's a piece of crap if it's Westinghouse."
2,Worked Great until It Didn't,"The TV worked great for 1 year and 1 week. Then it stopped working altogether. It is almost like it is programmed to last until the warranty period is out and then quit, forcing another purchase. Well, Westinghouse won't get my money again. Unbelievable."
1,DO NOT BUY WESTINGHOUSE PRODUCTS,"Same problem as everyone else..., the television set no longer works. It was an absolute waste of my hard-earned money. I remember the days when Westinghouse products were a good investment..., a thing of the past. DO NOT BUY WESTINGHOUSE..., DO NOT BUY WESTINGHOUSE..., DO NOT BUY WESTINGHOUSE..., DO NOT BUY WESTINGHOUSE...,"
1,yikes :(,"IT was a nice TV, I have had this TV for under 2 years, and well more of the same theme as i have been reading, one day the video mode would start switching, then cable company remote would no longer power the unit on, dispite reprogramming it. The it produced to when powering the unit on would only give a little blue light and about 10 minutes later the TV would come one. After doing very little research, I found there was not point in calling Westinghouse and I am guessing they resolved the issue by ignoring it and pulling the TV offf the market. I know when you buy a cheaper TV you get what you pay for, but this is inexcusable."
1,Quit after less than 2 years of almost no use,Same problem as many others. Google the model to view an unbelievable amount of problems with this model. With such a serious problem with quality Westinghouse should have recalled the unit in an attempt to salvage their reputation. From what I read on line they are unresponsive so I see no reason to waste my time on the phone with them. Out to the curb for trash pick up with this TV and to the store to purchase another - a different brand of course. I would suggest that Westinghouse change their name.
1,Should have done more research,"I got this TV on sale 11/08 through another site where it had decent reviews. At first, I was very happy with it considering I didn't pay much for it. Like many others, after EXTREMELY light use, I tried turning it on today & it won't power on :-("
1,Zero stars should be an option,"This unit was great... for the first 18 months or so. Now, it's pretty much a sorry excuse for a blackboard."
1,Died after 23 months!,TV failed to turn on after 23 months of extremely light use. We'll never buy another Westinghouse product again!
1,Not Practical @ all,"This book is completely un-useable! I wanted a book I could use to play pranks on my friends and enemies - this publication contains ""crimes"" which no one in their right mind would endeavor to achieve without ending up in the can. It seems like Hayduke wrote it because there is a lack of ""practical joke"" books on the market and he knew it would sell regardless of the content - which is inane and mindless. An example of a totally ridiculous one is spreading some ""human feces"" on bread and feeding someone a [pooh] sandwhich. This is about as good as the book gets - and who is going to try that one?! I'm so upset that I actually purchased this God-awful book.Advice for all you pranksters - If you must buy a book in order to learn practical jokes you can actually ""play"" get The Prankster's Ultimate Handbook by Erik Buckman. The gags within are all playable, enjoyable and it is truly a very funny read as well."
4,It was alright,"Personally i have bought the book and found most of the information pretty funny, And i have been reading some of the other reviews and it irritates me of how people are trying to buy the book for Practical jokes to play on their friends, well think of your own jokes hows that? Hayduke specifically says in the book ""However, the tricks, scams, stunts, cons, and scenarios presented here are done solely for informational and amusement purposes only"" and he goes on like that and even suggests a book for actual practical jokes. Granted this book is not useful for finding ways to prank your friends/enemies, but it is quite the entertaining read."
2,Mostly boring,Took me ages to read. Sometimes a bit funny but mosly boring. I don't like Trump but the person interests me. The book is as much hype as the Trump himself.
5,"Excellent, funny book",I read this over the Thanksgiving holiday. It was a perfect vacation read and a picture of Trump that must be driving Trump crazy! I laughed throughout and also got a good idea of what the Apprentice host is really all about -- he's error prone and a klutz when it comes to business. This is a cross between a biography written by a comedian and by a journalist. Great stocking stuffer!!
5,"Trump, New York, Hollywood, $, Truth!!! Great!","Just finished this last night. Corinne Smith is a long-time Trump book reviewer on Amazon and I agree with her review below -- this is the definitive Trump book. It is clearly, entertainingly written and takes you ""inside"". Inside Trump is a weird place, but larger points are made: about New York, real estate, America's celebrity fix, media manipulation, and Trump's own zany personality. LOVED IT! Sounds like the CD has problems though -- may pass on that."
2,Billy Elliott - The Movie,"Bought this video as a gift for my 10 year old boy, who is a dancer.Had heard good things about the Theatrical Version sothought would see the video.Heavy British Accents and lots of profanity notsuited for a young child..."
3,rental schmental,i thought this movie was pretty funny when i watched it. i'd watch it again but buying it seems a little excessive.
5,What a Classic,"What a great English film. I've seen it twice now as well warrented. Perfect casting by the boy that plays Billy Elliott. Great movie about acceptance. Yet never over done. Billy's teacher is a good actor too. Hats off. This is not as many English films are, harder to follow the humor or more even the culture. This film Is almost americanized. A must see once for all."
2,Wouldn't work in my players,"Because this DVD was released in a different 'region', it would not play in any of my DVD players. I have never experienced this problem before. We had to play it on the computer and the sound was almost inaudible. We had recently seen the play, and my son really wanted to see the movie version. It was quite a disappointment."
2,great movie bad dvd,the movie is great but you can barely hear the actors talking. the music is blaring. something had to be wrong with the dvd.
5,Real Emotions and Real Fun,Exceptionally good acting and display of exceptional emotion by a fourteen year old actor. Great story and will have your toe tapping and your heart urging Billy on.
5,Brilliance is spelled B-I-L-L-Y E-L-L-I-O-T,"What's not to like about this film. It is a masterpiece in every way. It shows that a boy can participate in something that is generally reserved for girls and not be a homosexual. In fact Billy's friend was there to show that Billy was not gay but that he accepted his friend for who he was. It showed that even the most intolerant of parents can be turned to support their child once they see how much it means to them and what talent they have, even in the worst situations. All the performances where great from the adults to the kids. Jamie Bell was a master a ""Billy"". I'm glad to see that he has become an A-list British actor and that he is getting so many starring roles. He deserves it, his acting is golden. 10/10 all around for this move, which in my book is a timeless classic with a great message, and a must watch for anyone with an ounce of tolerance."
5,"For all those who has a passion for art, or not","A story about a boy who finds his dream in an unexpected turn. Detained after a boxing match, he discovers a ballet class and trades his boxing gloves for a pair of ballet shoes. Set in the mid 80's in Northern England where his family was entangled with a bedlam strike, he heads off to his classes despite the father's detestation. The film captured the devastation of an impoverished family of that era. And the delivery of Jamie Bell's (Billy Elliot) character and ingenious performance utterly depicted a child's vulnerability and rising amongst chaotic fragments in this world. You can't help but be invigorated by this child's passion."
5,It is impossible not to love this wonderful film,"Yes, it may be just the slightest bit manipulative. Yes, the stakes are raised SO high that one has no other choice but to cheer loudly for the hero. Yes, some parts feel extraneous. But you know what? These flaws I only noticed in retrospect. Viewing this movie was one of the ultimate pleasures of my life. It is beautiful, funny, heartwarming, tear-jerking, and wonderfully done. Jamie Bell gives one of the best child performances to date. The final moment of the film made me cry like a baby, as did several other moments in the film. Are certain elements gratuitive (the friend, the grandma)? Maybe. Are they distracting? No. The film is so well shot and so well edited that even the slower parts flow brilliantly with the rest of the film. I am a voting member of the Academy, and this was my pick for Best Picture (certainly more enjoyable than Gladiator). This movie is The Full Monty times 10!"
2,Disappointed,"After all the wonderful things I heard about this movie, I was really excited to see it. Needless to say, after watching it on VHS, I was very disappointed. The plot was formulaic, the scenes seemed contrived. There wasn't very much character depth and development, and the acting could have been better. Some of it just didn't make sense within the flow of the movie, as if certain things were just thrown in for the sake of making the movie longer.I don't want to trash a movie that everyone else seems to love, but I honestly don't see the appeal. However, my boyfriend whom I anticipated wouldn't like the film at all gave it favorable reviews, so I guess it does have some sort of mass appeal.Overall, I guess my expectations were too high from the beginning. It's a cute, feel-good movie, but I don't think it's deserving of all the acclaim that it's gotten."
3,tell me something new...,"do what you love, that's the movie. have known it for 15 years. been there, done that. please show me something new."
1,Why does everyone like this movie so much???,"I recently purchased ""Billy Elliot"" on DVD because it had great reviews, and somehow it had missed showing at all of our local theaters. Once I saw the movie I realized why it never made to our local theaters. The movie isn't anything special. The cinematography could have been much better, especially the audio (I found myself having to adjust the volume constantly) as one scene is extremely quiet while the next is extremely loud (very annoying). The story was very predictable. All in all, a very disappointing purchase."
4,Wonderful story of hope,"A very good movie to watch with your children - not just for the cultural differences for an American kid, but the similarities in anyone having an uphill struggle to pursue a dream. A young boy in a tough Irish neighborhood dreams of the unconventional - to dance. He hides his desires from everyone, especially his father, but is found out and suffers for it. The story is told with touching acting, and yet, there is a huge goof you rarely see, when the camera caught the boom mike in the shot and no one edited it out or reshot it. Bargain basement filming techniques, I guess. However, as much as it glaringly makes the viewer ""fall out of the picture"" and remember it is only a movie, the story is still one I would recommend highly for anyone."
4,A great English film!,"I was surpirised to read that in many american reviews the accent was mistaken for IRISH! as a proud citizen of the north east of england i would like to confrim that it is a strong GEORDIE accent which originates in Newcastle and has traveled to Durham.the film is very moving and shows how times were hard in the mid 80's during the iron lady's government.Jamie Bell is fantastic an thoroughly deserved his BAFTA,for which he beat the mighty Tom Hanks!. Once you get past the over used F~~~ word it is a joy to watch, the sound track is brilliant. Just dont expect anything to be sugar coated, its not that kind of film."
5,Beautiful & Outstanding Performance!,"This is a beautiful film, warmth, sensational, and it may even make you cry. The film also makes you feel complete: it starts with young Billy's kiddie jumps while he's making his breakfast, it ends with grown-up Billy's beautiful ballet jump while he's already a superstar ballet dancer performing the Swan Lake. The storyline is straight foward but the details between the father and son's bonding, the confusing friendship with Billy's sweet gay friend Michael, are very well done. Jamie Bell (as Billy) did an outstanding performance in his debut. Undoubtfully, his acting, his dancing, his enthusiastic performance, really make this film truely alive! Billy Elliot, FIVE STARS!"
5,Touching Story,When you find a story line that impacts your thoughts and attitude---it's worth seeing. Billy Elliot has a great story line about acceptance and unconditional love between a Father and Son.
4,Gotta dance...,"Like ""The Full Monty,"" this film is a comic (but in no way belittling) treatment of hard times in a socially-challenged small town. The accents are thick and some of the cultural references are a bit curious, but there's no denying the true heart pumping through the story.*** Billy Elliot is an 11-year-old boy who secretly ditches his boxing lessons for ballet class. His father and older brother are both participants in a bitter miner's strike gripping their town in northeastern England. The whole family is also still in recovery-mode following the death of Billy's mother.*** Billy's exuberance and talent (and actor Jamie Bell's) are such a joy to behold. It makes it all the more poignant when he has to face his dad and brother's discovery of his dancing (as the audience knows they must). Billy is the title hero here, but by the film's end, every character has made their own stunning contributions."
4,Dancing and distress,Billy is a wonderfully happy and energetic boy with a great talent. This movie is uplifting but realistic and I suggest for audiences over 14. I thought it might be something I'd like my 8 year old grandson to see but too much profanity and the 'F' word.
5,billy elliot -wow,"My whole family loved this video. All emotions were used up in this film. Even though the dancing made me want to get up and dance along, I was entralled by the lifelong friendship of 2 boys, the changing relationonship between Billie and his father and the struggle of the family going on strike from the coal mines. We laughed and cried and cheered. But mostly ""We Loved to Boogie!"""
4,Call Him Fred,"Sound familiar? Who doesn't have it? A stubborn father. A middle or working class lifestyle. A self-absorbed sibling. Pride. Ambition. A cause. Mesh all of these things you get the standard life. Mesh all of these on screen, and you get ""Billy Elliot"". Set in 1984 England, it's a simple story of a boy who loves to dance, discovers he's got a talent for it, secretly learns how to dance, perfects his dance, and lives through (in the most childlike yet percociously adult way possibly) a series of trials (ie., townspeople's and families angry reactions) and achieves greatness. But it is a greatness that brings perceptions in line; it brings townspeople together; and, most importantly, it brings a family together, one who learns that perceptions are moot and hope and striving for a better life should be welcomed and pursued in any shape and opportunity. It's a great story, with solid acting."
5,A movie about passion,"I found such uninformed reviews about this movie that I have to respond. Those of you who don't get going from boxing to dance really have not watched this movie with any shall I say, insight ..I think that you should watch it maybe more than once .. perhaps with the sound up and it's preferable if you speak and/or understand the english language.And if you don't understand a young artist's struggle .. don't watch it .. move on to one of Arnold's movies ..I teach drama and work with a lot of theory and question about purpose ..This movie moves me and my students etc that I recommend it to all!"
1,Rubbish. Load of Junk!,"This DVD never worked. The supplier is selling bogus products. ""This DVD could not be properly authenticated for playback."" It is not a genuine product. The Billy Elliot synopsis worked but was just a copy of text from Wekipedia. Nothing else worked. Give your money to charity rather than but this bogus product."
5,Billy Elliot = A movie for everyone with a dream,"At first I didn't want to see this movie, but I am glad that I did. Like Billy, I had people that didn't think I should be a dancer because of certain reasons, not quite as severe as Billy though. He found the courage to push everyone aside and go the distance. I thought that Center Stage was a good movie filled with dancing and such, but Billy Elliot is better in my opinion because it shows that guys can have a passion to dance even more that girls."
5,Billy Elliot,I have had my eye on this movie! I already have it on DVD but it was just one of those movies that I needed on Blu-Ray!!!
3,A bit confused,"I'm not sure exactly how the movie arrived at the end. Billy starts out boxing, and ends up doing ballet. I didn't get it. Boys are supposed to do things like boxing, and girls do things like ballet. I think this movie is about a confused child that needs some strong, male direction. Perhaps the father should have been more careful with what he exposed his son to - definitely makes you think (I love movies that make me think).Regardless, Billy sure was a graceful dancer and it's a shame that dancing is for girls; Billy is SO good at it (why I bumped the rating up to 3 stars). If you like movies that will make you feel excited, confused, and dazzled by dancing boys - WATCH IT!"
1,Winnie the Poof does Flashdance ...,.... but you don't need subtitles to understand Jennifer Beals' dialogue.
5,excellent movie,"Worth every second that I watched. Julie Walters, Gary Lewis and Jamie Bell are flawless."
4,"Sweet, funny, lovely and spontaneous...","This film breaks your heart, then fills it up again with the hope that young Billy Elliot can indeed make a better life for himself far from his British mining town.Jamie Bell is an unrefined gem, raw and energetic in the title role, and this film's exploration of gender roles is handled with exquisite taste and sensitivity, gently mocking stereotypes but also offering touching examples of courage and grace from unexpected sources.My only major criticism would be the film's epilogue. Tacked on, perhaps, to give a sense of ""closure"" (complete with all-grown-up versions of several lead characters), this section felt wholly unnecessary, and definitely coloured my perception of the film as a whole.But even the end wasn't enough to mar this film in my mind, ... Definitely one worth adding to the collection..."
5,a triumph of human spirit,"humourous, inspirational and touching. an emotional and powerful journey that is both familiar and haunting to humankind. Only the light of faith, love and honesty can guide us through the darkness."
1,billy elliot,"The movie was in very good shape....except...you could only play it on a vcr in the United Kingdom! It was for my grandaughter and, as she lives a distance away, she did not return it to me. I am very disappointed! This grandaughter has been taking ballet lessons for 6 years and saw the play in New York. She had never seen this movie. I am very displeased and will not buy from this seller again."
2,Billy Elliot DVD,Loved the Movie. However DVD was of poor quality as it stopped or jumped ahead a large number of times.
5,INSPIRING AND BEAUTIFUL!!,"This was a fantastic movie. It had a really good message and the story was wonderful!! The acting and dialogue was magnificent!! This is one of my favorite movies, buy it!!"
5,Great resource!!,"I was recently doing a school report on cathedrals in france and i came acrosss this little gem. It is packed with information on both romanesque and gothic architectural styles and is not only educational but also very intriguing. After doing my report, i continued to read this book and to learn more about architecture. I reccomend this book because it is both informative and well written."
5,I love this poster!!,"I bought this for my boyfriend to send to him while we're apart. When we move in together it'll be the first poster we hang on the walls. Our first date was us seeing this movie so it means a lot to us. I wouldn't hang any other one on the wall, it's the most unique I've seen. I love it!"
1,Waste of money!,"My oldest son has a pillow that is shaped like a bus that you can record messages on. He LOVES it. My younger son does too..thus lots of fights. So when I saw this pillow I jumped on it. Words cannot express how disappointed I was with the quality. First, the pillow is pretty small, and the the recording device is like this giant box right in the middle of it. So, not too fun to cuddle with. Recording the message is like learning Latin...then when I finally got it recorded, the quality wss so poor it wasn't even fun to listen to. It was scratchy, like the speaker was blown. Needless to say I returned to Amazon for a refund....my search for a quality recordable pillow continues.... DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!"
4,"Great Book, helped out a LOT!","This last spring, my husband and I spent two months in Denver on a business trip. We purchased the Insider's Guide to Denver before we left, and I did a lot of reading before we departed. So when I got there, I already knew a lot. Then, while we were there, we used this book everyday. The maps were outstanding, they helped us navigate the whole time we were there. We also used the restaurant section a lot, and the activities section. We were never without something to do, because if we found ourselves with a free moment, all we needed to do was whip out this book, and off we went to another great place. This book has many creases in it now, and it was the greatest book we could have bought. I highly recommend it! The only thing was I found some things had changed since the book was last updated, and it could use another edition."
4,Good basic exegetical study,"This is an excellent overview of the imprecatory Psalms. It doesn't go through all the Psalms, but enough of them to give a sound theological framework for their interpretation. I would highly recommend the book. It is very balanced and it deals squarely with the issues in the context of all of Scripture."
4,Working my way through the book...,"Enjoying the book very much after receiving it as a present from my mother-in-law. My soon to be 11-month-old loves the recipes for carrots, broccoli, spinach... and I like the recipes, too-- so we share some of her veggies and add some of mom and dad's salmon or chicken, and everyone's at the table and happy. I'm also amazed at how much less expensive it is to prepare organic, healthy baby food."
5,Historical accuracy triumphs over politcal correctness!,BRAVO! This book is long overdue! Finally historical fact is placed over group think and pressure groups!
2,Questions about Bacque's work,"As with Bacque's book Other Losses,a panel of historians assembled to contest Bacque's charges. According to his opponents,Bacque arrived at the figure of 5.7 million dead by counting certain population statistics twice,and then when the 195O census fell short of his inflated numbers,treating the difference as deaths. The German historian Christof Straub denies Bacque's claim that Eisenhower prohibited Germans from bringing food to the prisoners;he says that churches were permitted to feed prisoners. An American veteran cited in Eisenhower and the German POWs said that townspeople brought food to the camp where he was stationed."
2,From BYRDS Fan's in CALIFORNIA,This CD had some of the best songs we have heard by THE BYRDS. Some of the songs had the sounds of the early years of the (four members) BYRDS Group. Some of the songs were also some of worst songs we think we have heard by THE BYRDS. The songs by Roger McGuinn's Thunderbyrd Band sounded the best and the last three songs sung by McGuinn/Hillman/ Clark were like the BYRDS of the late 60's and 70's. The sound quality was not that great. If you are a truly a BYRDS fan you probably would miss out if you did own this set.
5,Origin is great,"'Origin: You too are from Israel, You too are the People' is packed full of information that proves the identity of the lost tribes of Israel - Yair really knows his stuff on this subject. Recommended reading for sure."
3,It's ok. Same beat over and over...,"I bought this cd thinking it was going to be like ""El General"" or ""Nando Boom"" type of music, but unfortunatley, it wasn't. It sounded like if it was the same song playing over and over, exept that it had different words. Overall is good, I guess.If anybody knows where to buy a ""Nando Boom"" CD, please let me know. Thanks."
4,Inspired by Loco,"Locomotive being one of the most liked objects from my child-hood, I purchased this book from a local store, which surprisingly elevated my inspirations to find more and more details of the histories and the transformation of the locomotives from the ancient times to the latest super power engines.The book illustrates the locomotives in a pictorial manner having clearly categorizing them in forms of sub continents and great rail routs. each picture and zoomed-out pictures of the locomotives are explained to the detail specifications of the Date of Origin, Builder, Clients, Gauge, Driving wheels, Capacity and Total weight.The book mainly classify its details as The birth or railway, The golden age 1900-1950, 1950 to Modern day.This book is recommended for Loco lovers."
5,I love these plates.,I needed two of these plates to complete a set for my kitchen. I use them in the microwave to heat food up because my regular dinner set gets very hot in the microwave. I love these plates because they are easy to take care of.
4,Witty send-up of literary scene,"Ms.Powell disects the world of writers and lays them out on a slab for all to see. Takes you through one writer's bestseller and its consequences on those around him. Reminiscent of Capote's ""betrayals"" to his society acquaintances. Entertaining and witty as any of Ms. Powell's novels always are."
5,"a charming novel, highly recommended for married people","A quirky novel about how the ghost of Calvin Coolidge saves a happy marriage. This story is about China, about being an American, and about facing moral challenges. And it's humorous -- because the reader knows more than the narrator does. It also tells how community can step in to keep life in order. Finally, I like its portrait of marriage. So much of literature focuses on pursuit rather than maitenance, and now that I'm married I'm interested in the former rather than the latter."
2,Not too good,"First of all, this is not the all time worst book I've ever read. But it's CERTAINLY not the best. I can't see why it won a Newberry. It's mostly uninteresting and has a weird plot with no emotional or mental value. I find that reading a book about a kid who becomes friends with a guy who grows onions to be boring."
3,Onion John,"I read Onion John. This book is about a person named Andy who made friends with a man named Onion John. Onion John does not speak any English, but Andy soon learns to talk Onion John's language. The whole town builds Onion John a house, however he doesn't know how to use the furnace. He ends up burning down his house. Onion John runs away and never comes back.This book was OK. It really did not have much of a point to it, and it did not have believeable characters. The overall book was easy to read and understand, but it did not hold my attention. I would not recommend this book."
1,Bad!!,"This was for a school project. It was really boring and unrealistic, nothing happened that was half-way good. I'd rather read Jerry Spinnelo or Jenny Nimmo."
2,It was boring,"Onion John takes place in a city called Serenity,about the mid 1900's. It's about a boy named Andy who was at a baseball game and met Onion John. Andy and John tried crazy ideas together,like making gold,and fumigating. Andy and John were best friends until Andy convinced Onion John and Andy's father to become friends. After that the people of Serenity built him a new house. He burnt it down the next week because he didn't know how to use his new stove. Onion John is a man who can't speak English. It was a really boring book and didn't make sense in some parts."
1,Erin W. review is wrong from Dannie p.,"Greetings! I am here to write a ""contraction"" so to speak, to erin w.'s reveiw of Onion john! I have found 3 statements that are untrue and unsupported by any facts in thw book. Though a newberry award winner, onion john can be improved in many ways!So please erin w. know what you are talking about before you write a review!"
1,Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooring!,"I am in 4th grade. This book was so slow I couldn't finish it. If you want a good book, try Hatchet. I can't believe I couldn't rate this book with a zero. I would like to be on that Newbery Committee to select good kids books like Wayside School, anything by Roald Dahl or other Louis Sachar books."
2,Just never exciting,"Although maybe a trifle interesting, this book just never got exciting! I kept on reading it hoping that it would, but near the end I realized it wouldn't. Also, the language is almost too simple. And building a house for someone in one day? Hey, didn't the concrete need to dry before they could continue working? This is just one example of what's so unrealistic in the book. Maybe I was just too old for the book (I was 14 when I read it, I'm 15 now.) E-mail me if you want to with your different(or same) viewpoints."
4,Very useful for those interest in oxide properties.,"The book I used was a translation of the 1969 Russian edition by C. N. Turton and T. I. Turton. It is an extensive list of tables of the physical and chemical properties of all of the oxides. It is very useful; however, it should be updated."
4,Elvis gets the ID.,It was everything I expected. Most interesting. This is a follow up to the documentary on PBS.
3,The Church is not that secretive,This book demonstrates open documentation from the Catholic Church on important social issues. Institutionalized slavery was a given in past ages. the Popes of each age issued statements progressivly in favor of humane treatment of slaves to the eventual abolition of slavery. The author has a tendancy to soft-soap some of the history. I find that disappointing. A strong organization does not need to cover up. Admission of errors is a sign of maturity and strength.
2,No instructions when you really need it,"Maybe this thermometer is good. I wouldn't know. I got it in the mail and used it a total of 3 times for my toddler. When I really needed it in the middle of the night, it started blinking an upside-down triangle. Since there was NO manual, I didn't know what that meant. When I mean no manual, it came in packaging and that's it. Nothing else. Luckily I had a backup thermometer. I finally found some online manual through the ADC website, which showed that the battery was weak. FYI, you need a really small screwdriver and the small battery type is not easy to find. It's been 2 months and I'm still periodically working on getting this back to work. Bottom line, I'm a minimalist, but sending me something with zero instructions really sucks."
5,Can take a beating well,"Less than two weeks after I got this thermometer, I left it in my scrub top and put it in the laundry. I saw it in the washer afterward, took it out and removed the battery. I didn't touch it for a few days to give it a chance to dry, put the battery back in, and now it works just fine again. I don't know if it would fare as well through the dryer.As far as standard use goes, it has a pretty fast read, and it seems to be accurate."
1,Defective product,"I have purchased this product with great expectation. But when I opened the box, the thermometer did not work. There was a strange sound but the device did not indicate any number. First, I thought it was due to the battery but later realized that the cables within the device were not welded at all. This must have been a defective product. I have read similar complaints in the product reviews, and am really, really disappointed!!"
4,Accurate measurements but no choice of F/C,"Overall it's a good piece. Easy to use, measurements are accurate, waiting time is just 8 seconds.. The only con is that the manual suggests one can choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit, but in fact it's impossible (or may be I got lucky and received one that doesn't work properly?)"
1,Don't buy this one,"I read all the reviews and decided upon this thermometer. Big mistake. I have arthritis in my hands that isn't yet severe, but makes gripping a bit difficult. I had to struggle to get the sheeth off. There wasn't enough unsheathed thermometer to give me space for a good grip. It worked OK as far as temp was concerned, but it was difficult to shut off. You have to push in on the end of the thermomether, and it kept turning off and on again. After months of wellness, and therefore no need of a thermometer, I took it out this morning to use, and it would not turn on. I struggled to get the cover off to check the battery and can find no way to change it. The thing no longer turns on, so I went back to one of the old mercury ones left from my childhood. Very disappointed. Save your money. I think the designer was more interested in making it look like a cool sort of space probe than on whether it was actually usable. Must have been a Treky."
5,"Easy to use, and read.","Some of the previous reviews of this item alerted me to a possible problem with changing the read-out from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The tip given was to hold the key as instructed for 5+ seconds, and it worked. Now it is set to Fahrenheit and no issues. Seems to work and seems accurate. Great item to send with your student to campus, so when they ""don't feel well"" they can take their temp. and know if its something to see a doctor about or just ride it out."
1,waste of money,"i did some research to find the right thermometer and this was a going one on Amazon. I got it and when my 7 month old daughter had temperature, each time I used it within one minute, the temperature readings showed different numbers. It was extremely inconsistent and a waste of money to purchase. If a child has 104 temperature the thermometer should read very near that each time you take or double check the amount and the numbers should not fluctuate, its not about moods."
4,It's works and it's cheap....,"Seems to be fairly accurate and is quite fast. Usually, it's less than 10 seconds for a reading. The loosely fitting plastic cover could have been engineered for a better fit, but otherwise it's great for the meager price tag."
1,Dud?,"It doesn't seem like most people got a dud like I did. I got ONE temperature reading out of it, and that was it. It no longer cooperated. It would turn on, but would not make any reading. It still has it battery in it unfortunately and turns itself on for no apparent reason. I've had it for three months, and it still continues to turn on/off on its own."
1,Weak.,"This thermometer was very accurate and easy to use in the 15 minutes that it worked. Regrettably, it also is not returnable."
3,Met my needs,Pros: Does what I needed it to do (take my temperature). Seems to be plenty accurate.Con: The button that turns it on and off is very difficult to press.
2,"Terrible instructions, no beep signal","It is next to impossible to tell from the instructions how to operate this thermometer. Examples: There is no beep to signal when the measurement is complete, the on - off switch seems to work sometimes but not others and one can't tell when, the display shows an ""L"" at times but this is not shown in the instructions (and since its brand new, I assume this doesn't mean the battery is Low). I wish I had paid more attention to the fact that this item is nonreturnable. I will probably throw it out and not order anything in the future without checking Amazon's return policies first."
4,Apolitical and even fairly mundane,"This was a well done documentary. From the description and the subject, you'd expect it to be very anti-war or a political film, but it is not. It entirely avoids politics and merely illuminates the business of selling armored cars. It's not even that interesting since there arent too many details of how the cars are made, how he got into the business etc. The best parts are the daily life scenes in Afghanistan and Iraq."
4,Wonderful fiesta go along......,"I hesitated to use these mugs when I first received them. Now I use them exclusively as our everyday mugs. They are a nice heavy weight ceramic that helps keep our coffee warm, they do not chip and wear beautifully. I and my husband do not have a problem with the size of the ring to hold our mug as the other reviewer did. I would have given them five stars if they held more coffee as I prefer a big mug. These are simple and elegant in their design as all the fiestaware pieces are. You can't go wrong with these if you are a fiesta fan!"
2,Not practical at all,"Although this is a very interesting book that cointains info that may be very valuable for some people, it is not what it promises to be. It says ""A Practical Guide to Sustainable Communities"", but, as the author explains in the foreword, the initial idea for the book changed on the way while he was writing it.If you are somebody who whats to build an Ecovillage, who wants practical advice about others experience, getCreating a Life Together: Practical Tools to Grow Ecovillages and Intentional Communitiesinstead.If you just want a nice magazine-style book for a tour visiting many of the more succesfull ecovillage experiences in the world, this is a great book.I just give 2 stars because the subtitle ""practical guide"" is misleading. If it not were for it, I would give it 3 and a half."
1,Not at all what I thought it would be....oh well.,"This book offered nothing new or enlightening about sustainable living. However, if you are looking for a book on hippie communes (i.e. communal living), than this is the book for you. That about covers it."
3,Easy Cozy Read,"I have read a number of the Aunt Dimity novels and intend to read the rest. They are a nice light distraction for someone, like me, is too stressed right now to read more ""serious"" literature. The novels are formulaic, pleasingly so, like the old Nancy Drew novels, except more adult. Lori is once again away from home in an old house, unexpectedly snowbound with two strangers and a somewhat wacky-seeming old retainer. She has of course brought her faithful stuffed rabbit, Reginald, and Aunt Dimity's journal. Of course, whever Lori goes, mystery is sure to follow. This time it has to do with the past. One thing that I did find annoying, as another reviewer pointed out, is that in every book, Lori is swooning after some handsome male she encounters. In this one, she seemed to have gone overboard with lust. I would like it better if the author gave Lori more loyalty to her wonderful husband. A little mild flirting once in awhile is okay, but for heaven sake, give her some self control."
5,more than skin deep!,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends AM I A COLOR TOO? as a big picture book, superbly illustrated by Gerald Purnell, on a touchy subject: how to explain the ""race"" of children borne of ""mixed"" parentage, when ""Other"" seems so dismissive.Here, young Tyler wonders why we focus on the color of our skin rather than the person inside. Through his eyes we explore the common labels of Black & White, & if we come in, see, smile, sing, dance in all colors of the rainbow, why do we separate people, like shoe boxes, into only two?"
5,"THE ""SPIRITUALLY [my addition] SLEUTH SISTERS'"" STORIES","Wow!!! What a great Christian anthology of four novellas from GREAT authors who weave their own lives into four mystery novellas that are challenged to be written and published by a ""Professor Drake"" who has led their [imaginary] Convention about just such a topic. All four of these novellas - and excellent tie-ins ""Prologue"" + ""Epilogue"" will bring you to page turning this book in one and a half days. (Yep! I counted it just for you!) What a great idea for a gift for your favorite someone or for yourself. I really loved this one. And it already had my favorite author in it as one of its authors (Susan May Warren.) The others are newcomers to me up to this point but believe me I'll be back for more! Come and get it! You won't be sorry!"
5,love it,I think this movie does a great job at showing what really happened. I had to watch this for my class and I can honestly say this is one of the films where I still mention it to this day.
3,Hanging!!,"I did not realize that I had read this before, if you are into people being hanged (hung) by a crazy person then you might enjoy this book. Not for the sensitive!!"
4,Don't judge a book from it's cover.,"Meet Dan, a city gang member that is trying to striaghten out his life. But when one of Trixie's friends is badly hurt all eyes turn on Dan. Did Dan do it? What about the moutain lion? All these questions are answered in one of Trixie's greatest adventures. Trixie also learns not to jundge a book by its cover. Trixie Drew; age 13"
1,Deadly to PETS!,"This stuff works well, BUT it almost killed my 60lb Yellow Lab!!! There are safer alternatives that work as well and are as easy to use. Please BEWARE this product has a flavor additive dogs like! Try Sluggo instead.Monterey Sluggo Snail & Slug Control For Organic Gardening - 2.5 lb Shaker Bottle LG6500"
1,Holy Cheapness Batman!,"I've been taken a few times, and this was one of them. This was a cheap thin styrofoam molding overlaid with a paper print of the whitehouse, and then cut into a ""zillion"" repetitively shaped pieces that could hardly be classified as a puzzle. My grandson & I worked for hours on it; then called in reinforcements from a neighbor who is a Puzzle Pro. After 4 or 5 hours, the neighbor went home shaking his head. We finally stuffed it all back in the box, threw it in the trash can, and ordered the Legos Architecture Whitehouse. And to think, it cost me over $45 with shipping to get this piece of trash. Never again!"
2,Present for a friend,"Present for a friend, I personally do not like it at all. Maybe it is an old classic"
3,EL MEJOR DE TODOS,"ME ENCANTA CAMILO, SIN EMBARGO, LO CATALOGO CON 3 ESTRELLAS PORQUE ESPERÉ QUE EL DISCO TUVIERA AL MENOS MAYOR INFORMACION DEL CANTANTE COMO UN FOLLETO O RESEÑA, PERO NO ENCONTRE ESO. SIN EMBARGO, CAMILO ES EL MAS GRANDE DE LOS CANTANTES DE BALADAS ROMANTICAS PUES SU TIMBRE DE VOZ ALCANZA NIVELES INSOSPECHADOS Y LAS LETRAS DE LAS CANCIONES TOCAN HASTA EL ALMA MAS MACHISTA Y DURA."
5,The Best Album,This is the best album ever put together by an artist. Contains 2 CD's with classic songs by Camilo Sesto that inspire and bring back some very good memories. I purchased this CD as a gift and could not part from it after I listened to some of the songs. This is definitely a bargain and you will not be disappointed with this buy.
5,Spellbinding,"Hannah has created the highest form of art- that which moves the listener to the point where they wonder how music so magnificent can actually exist- and it does. Subterfuge's lyrics are intricate rhymes woven into rich melodies- melodies resonating with deep stellar texture and overlapping harmonies. Each song on every album Hannah released is a rare gem, each with its own iridescent tint and polished surface, reflecting intriguing worlds. Her lyrics stretch far beyond the limits of conventional imagination but yet speak so well of life's realities. If there is a Muse of Music, she has clearly chosen Hannah as the vehicle through which perfect songs are to reach our society. Where angels sing in the dark woods of hopeful beauty, there you will find Hannah's songs playing in the trees, and sonically walking with you."
1,False Advertising,"I bought this product for my children who were very eager to watch the life cycle of ladybugs. The back of the packaging shows the children how to order the larvae online, how to expect them to pupate and then to watch the adult ladybugs.The problem arose when we opened the box. A bright yellow piece of paper informed us that as US customers we could not purchase larvae, instead we had to purchase live bugs. This completely defeats the purpose of this product.I take umbrage at the packaging promising one thing and the product delivering something different. This product should not be sold as is."
1,Very little about printing,"I picked this book up at the library (fortunately I didn't buy it) because I'm interested in printing my black and white images. I was surprised to find that printing isn't addressed until page 147. The section on printing amounted to 10 pages in total, out of 160 pages in the book. The title of the book should be ""Black and White Digital Photography"" -- the word ""Printing"" doesn't belong in the title."
2,Not a very useful book,"I do not recommend this book to anyone who has more than very basic knowledge of the computerized digital process. In addition, the book contains nice examples but no useful ways to get there on your own. I have purchased the book and read it but did not find it useful. I was disappointed."
4,Excellent Introduction to Lagrangian Mechanics,"I used this book for a semester long junior level classical mechanics course. It was a very good introduction to Lagrangian mechanics. The early chapters had me revisiting my freshmen physics book just to re-familiarize myself with concepts since it had been over a year since I had taken any physics courses. However, after doing that I found this book to be easily approachable. Some of the problems can be pretty challenging and may often involve clever mathematics tricks which made me question why Taylor was making me jump through all these hoops when the primary emphasis should be on physics and not mathematics."
4,The classic text for a good reason,"This is one to hold onto long after you're done with your Intermediate Dynamics class. It focuses on Lagrangian mechanics and rotation of rigid bodies, but it also covers orbits, chaos, special relativity, Hamiltonian mechanics, etc. It's good to have as a reference, because the explanations are generally clear and thorough. The problems are decent, though in my opinion they tend to focus overly much on proofs and derivations.There is far too much here to cover in one semester, but each chapter is well laid out and makes sense. Some of the examples are useful, but don't be afraid to skip them if they seem unnecessary."
5,Easily one of the best classical mechanics books on the market,"This book does a great job of covering classical mechanics in a manner that is approachable by students but that also has the level of rigor required in a higher level course. I suspect most students can breeze through the first five chapters in a week or two and then move on to the meat of the subject. However, I wouldn't skip the beginning chapters completely. There's some good stuff in there, like the discussion of the damped driven harmonic oscillator, which many students may not have ever analyzed, and the concept of center of mass coordinates."
5,An excellent text,"This textbook is comprehensive, clearly written, well-paced, and thoughtful. Taylor clearly is an experienced professor and understands well how to convey material to students. Whether this text is required for your intermediate/advanced undergraduate classical mechanics course or you are someone who wishes to brush up on mechanics, this is the book."
4,Academic Yet Accessible,"I purchased this book for a class at University on women's social history. It is the first of its kind to follow the lives of Chinese-American women from the late 1800s when Congress placed strict regulations on Chinese immigration through the War Years. Compared to most history texts, I found the writing accessible and the stories intriguing. I do not consider myself a feminist, and I get annoyed when textbooks about women's history go preachy about their subject matter, and this book avoids that, maintaining academic distance without being remote in tone. This is a book I will actually probably keep after the course has ended because it sheds light on a minority group not often considered in the context of oppressed minorities, and does so in a way that leaves a lasting impression without putting the reader to sleep."
3,Good information,"The book provides good information with a huge bibliography. It's very complete, and factual. The writing is good and provides a great overview with real quotes from real women of the time."
4,Educational AND Fun!,"At first the size of the book was a bit daunting, but I found myself sucked into the lives of the Chinese women as they navigated through American society. I also appreciated Ms. Yung's use of her own family to weave the history of Chinese women in America. I look forward to checking out Unbound Voices as well."
3,Useful,"I found this a useful book in better appreciating that the NT was most likely written in Hebrew, and not Greek which is commonly believed.In my opinion this was the best part of the book and the writers use logical arguments to support their claim.Do I have a better understanding of what some of Jesus sayings are as result of seeing the Hebrew translation? Not really. And that's the downside of this short and quick read."
5,Foundation Truths,Great for seeing into the Foundations of the Lord's Words and the Hebrew was his spoken language.
3,Ok,"Not exactly what I expected, but it is a good book to have on the shelf when needed. Not one I would buy again though if borrowed and not returned."
2,Interesting but lacking in useful details,"I looked forward to reading this book but am left with the feeling its more of a sophomoric essay than a useful guide to interpretation of the gospels. Its repetitive in its statements of evidence that the scriptures were of Hebrew origin, using the tried-and-true 'and this fellow said it was and so did that fellow...'. It has only a few examples that it repeats across several chapters. The whole concept that understanding idioms will help in scriptural analysis is certainly significant but this book lacks the depth required for it to be useful. I am hoping the author someday uses this tool in a serious manner and publishes his work."
3,Get it if you can,"This version of Shaolin & Wu Tang is released from Hemdale Home Video. The back cover indicates, ""Dubbed and Subbed"". Dubbed alright, no subs at all.Quality appears to be a DVD-R at best of a VHS heavily used.1.33:1 so much of the action is cut off (I had the original VHS from the 80's that got damaged).Great movie. Worth the purchase if you can't get a hold of a better quality disc"
3,A lot of work to put together,I bought this for my son's room. It does a nice job hiding all his little things in the doors. It works well with a childs room.It was a lot of work to put together...tons of screws and took a good 2-3 hours and I put together a lot of stuff. It wasnt a problem but a long time. Then my son stood on one of the bottom doors and it broke away but I was able to fix it..make sure it is for a child at least 4 so they will know not to use it as a gym.
1,Previously owned part swaped in return from previous buyer.,"When received, the package had been previously opened. The circuit board was so warped it looked like an arc and would not go in the slot. All the memory chips were snapped in half while still attached to the board. It would appear that the item might have been a previous return and got swapped with a defective part. Whom ever pulled the order and shipped it never opened the package and looked at the part or it would have been obvious to its failing.The return was simple but it took a while to get my refund. Almost 2 weeks.They are on my personal do not buy from list."
5,Ellen Tebbits,"My favorite book that I read this year is Ellen Tebbits. It was wriiten by Beverly Cleary. Ellen is in a ballet class. Her teachers name is Mrs Spottford. Mrs. Spottford's son is Otis Spottford keeps teasing her. Her problem is that it is cold outside and book tales about having winter underware. At her bllet class she tries to get there early and she finds out that there was Austine. She was from Califorina.She always talked about it then when Ellen got her ballet costume on, her underware started to show and her ballet uniform started to rip."
2,"Wonderful book, AWFUL voiceover","A caveat: this is a marvelous book -- I adore it. However, the actress reading it delivers the worst performance of a children's book I've ever heard. For reasons known only to her and her director, she chose to voice Austine as a geriatric New York male with a learning disability. Every time Austine spoke, it completely ruined the book for my family. Even my KIDS noticed how incongruous the voice of Austine was: ""Mommy, why does Austine sound like an old man? What's wrong with her?"" Truly, truly awful. So be warned -- a fabulous story, a horrific read."
3,Ellen and Austine,I chose this rating because I like when they broke upand got back together. I also like the beginning at the dance class because it is funny that they both wore winter underwear.
5,Hair rinse,Love it! Exactly what I wanted to help cover the gray in betweentrips to the hairdresser. Easy to use and not messy.
4,No complaints VERYY good other than...,"i would absolutely give this five stars because it worked great other than the horrible funky ""weird steal bread/dried up playdough"" smell and i could not get rid of it i hated it but other than than i loved peoples reactions when i told them it only lasts it for a day i loved the compliments i got if i could hide that awful smell (in the beginning of the day i HATED the smell but by the end of the day i got used to it and it then made me hungry for a sammich) it would be a perfect product i have light blonde hair but darker hair underneath naturally and it all came out."
5,Magnificently Sung,"The is a beautiful recording. Corelli was and is probably the BEST Chenier you'll ever see or hear. A tall, handsome man with a magnificent voice. I have seen and heard many Chenier's but this is by far the best. Not to be slighted, Capucilli's Gerard and the rest of the cast do an outstanding job. Beautifully filmed."
3,Not that great,"When I saw these earrings, I thought they looked so shiny and cute. Unfortunately though, when I got them, the silver was tarnished and they didn't really look like the picture."
1,Not even close,"I decided to try this when my Sansa clip LCD failed. As I disliked some of the media organisation of the clip, maybe this would be better. Not even close. Very poor access design, low res lcd screen and non intuitive button use. I simply could not get it to play simple mp3 files. 3rd rate documentation was no help. Going back to the Clip."
4,"Does the job, but not waterproof","I use this to keep my dog from running through my garden. I works very well for that, however,you must remember to cover it up when it is raining (or leave it in some sort of a shelter), or it will quit working. I actually think the manufacturer should do a better job of weatherproofing it, as the item is intended for outdoor use, isn't it? Still, I am purchasing another one."
4,A truely shocking product,"This product delivers exactly what it says it does. The dogs are keeping clear of the chicken yard, and we haven't lost a hen since turning it on. Having experienced it first hand, I suspect a truely stubborn goat might not pay it attention, but the dogs want nothing to do with it!"
1,Be wary using this fence charger around small animals,"I bought one of these to use in a small pen to train piglets to electric fence before putting them out to pasture. Since they had never been in an electric fence before I had to put ElectroNet woven fence up to keep them from charging through it the first couple of times they got shocked. Well, they got tangled in the fencing and unfortunately it killed both of my 7 week old registered Tamworth piglets before I even got their registration papers sent out. I only had them here for a day. Now I am out $600 and have to find a charger with an intermittent charge so I don't kill the next 2 piglets I buy. Not only that but I'll have to drive over 10 hours to buy more piglets if I buy from the same breeder..."
1,Electrocution,"5 strands of a couple hundred feet worked through the rain, an ice storm, etc. Really got it to protect chickens from neighborhood cayotes and dogs which broke through the strand and haven't seen it since. BUT the fence will ELECTROCUTE, did zap some growing Rooster (even though I had explicitly told him to stay away), at least I can find them now though, instead of disappearing, but you probably want a lower amp fence, it's not everytime as I've seen them fly through it, and only been the last couple of days that they got fried. Fence has been up over a month."
5,used for years,We have used these for many years in our cattle sorting chutes. The Fi-Shock SS-525CS work very well for this application.
1,Lame,"I was very disappointed with this product. It doesn't have a blinking light or clicking noise to let you know it's working. After much effort, we found out that the product didn't even work. I may have just gotten a defective one, but I was still disappointed that it lacked a way to tell you if it was on."
3,Works fine but is not for long runs or degraded wiring,"I use this on a small 2 ac field wired with electric fence rope. It works OK but the wiring must be in good shape. I would not use it for bulls, but it works fine for horses."
4,Another excellent collaboration,"Although quite unknown in Holland I was advised to buy this album which I obviously did. No regrets. At the contrary even. What an appealing album this is. It's almost as good as the one with Elvis Costello, at least from my perspective."
5,mmmmm - delicious,I saw this concert on Soundstage - im a long time fan of Bacharach - i didnt know Ron Isley - id never heard him perform solo - but his voice was so smooth and mature i asked everyone at work who the singer is - and one girl who is a big fan of his identified him to me - Dionne Warwick is the only other singer ive heard perform these songs with such depth - most of the songs are slowed down and very introspective - the arangemnts are ravishing and not cloying
5,WARNING: The sound of Isley's voice might incite fertility,"Ron Isley, I see that your Breeding Assistance Program is still in full effect.Clearly, between the 70's and 90's there weren't enough children conceived while their parents heard the sound of your voice. So you are at it. Again.In Between the Heartaches, Anyone Who Had Heart, Love's Still the Answer, Windows of the World, A House Is Not A Home, This Guy's In Love With You, how can you not fall in love, be fruitful and multiply?Combine Isley's vocals and on point phrasing with the stellar melodies of Bacharach, the strong and longing lyrics of Hal David, the PERFECT arrangements and the fabulous orchestra and you have pure magic.I don't think that I can do an adequate explanation for each song, but do yourself a favor. Buy this CD!Also, PBS taped the live performance which was even better than the pitch perfect CD if you can imagine that."
2,Bach to the Isley,"Ron Isley has the ache the yearning the whipspered voice that should cling to the understated melodies of Burt Bacharach. It doesn't. Dionne Warwick, Carpenters, heck even Elvis Costello has deeper interpretations of Bacharach/David songs. The show case song, ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"", was never a great B/D song and Isley's slow ""new"" version just makes it sound like American Idol gone blooey. There are no new arrangements here that are worth anything more than a passing nod.Burt Bacharach has nothing left to prove, Ron Isley has sung more romantic songs on his own records/cds than one possibly can. This Cd is for completists"
3,What could have been.,"Bless his heart,he really tries! Don't blame it on Mr.Bacharach, but Mr.Isley just doesn't have the vocal chops to pull this stuff off.Imagine Dionne, Jackie, Luther, or even Elvis C. revisiting some of these great tunes and arrangements!"
1,Not Burt's Best,"Lovers of these great Bacharach ballads beware.Here's another one of those music treatments in which an overly lush singing style almost completely overwhelms the lyrics.It put me in the mood to unearth some of my old Bacharach discs so I could sit back and enjoy the wonderful stories that unfolded in their words. The new Rod Stewart stuff shows how to perform ""oldies"" in a new style and still do justice to the lyrics."
5,This is a great flashlight,This is a great flashlight. it's solid and very bright. I did order the wrong replacement bulb. It uses the small plug in type so be careful.
4,Works well,Got it for my hubby. He likes that the light beam is adjustable. and it's large enough it's not easy to lose. lol
1,button no good,i really like this flashlight until the little button on top broke and it didnt work anymore what is thepoint to having indestructable body and a flimsy button i guess ill have to buy another brand in the future
5,GREAT DVD SET!,We bought this DVD set for a friend of ours that is overseas in Iraq. It has brought many laughs for the unit and our friend absolutely LOVED it! They have gotten a kick out of the episodes and all of the little gadgets that came with it!
3,Good for the ultra fan but little more than that.,"The DVDs do not include any special features; considering that all episodes may be watched on the studio's website, the actual DVDs are of little value to someone that normally has a computer with decent internet access (in the US at least). The box includes some things that are worth little more than a slight glance, a plastic pimp chain, a badge etc. There is a slightly entertaining story that was featured in one of the episodes not on the disks. The big picture is that unless you are a collector of some sort, the collection is not worth buying. There are some very entertaining episodes, but because you can see them all for free, it's not necessary to buy the DVD for the average viewer."
5,Great product,Hot plants is worth the price. it really helps when your libido is down and you want a boost in your love life.
3,Better than nothing,With menopause comes vaginal dryness. Bummer! This product seems to help me a little with that problem. However that's about all it does for me. I can't really say it helps me to feel more horny or anything like that.
2,NO INCREASE IN MY LIBIDO!,"Being over 50, I had high hopes for this product. I so wanted to recapture that excitement with my husband. I tried it for 2 months, taking as directed. I noticed no change whatever. I'm still in love with my husband and he with me regardless."
2,"It helped her, ....","Well she said her hot flash symptoms are less intense when taking this product. I don't know if the supplement does everything it claims, but it did have some effect on her. Maybe a placebo effect, I'm not a Dr. do I can't say for sure ;)"
4,Works well.. So I hear!,My homeopathic dr told me about this after I told her my lack of desire. I had been taking it for 4 days and then I hurt my back and I've been in bed rest for a week... So now i haven't been taking it but will start once I'm back to feeling normal :)
5,Make Doll House Special,Wonderful book. Author explains clearly and has great pictures to follow along. It is one of my go-to books that I use often.
5,Beautiful Well Made Hammock,"Hammock arrived promptly and well packaged in excellent condition -a very beautiful hammock of excellent quality. It is indeed a Mayan weave style hammock -the type that basically wrap around you so you could sleep in them without the fear or rolling out. The quality of the weaving & knots is very nice and the design is more elaborate than most for a great price. It really is a beautiful piece of work. Unfortunately the frame we ordered (Big Daddy Wood Frame) from a different vendor was too small. The Mayan is a standard 13 ft. hammock requiring a 14 ft. frame or bigger. The Big Daddy is only 13 ft. The frame would have been much harder to return, so, unfortunately, had to return the hammock. Because of that, can't comment about durability or fading. Designed for Outdoors was very helpful with return. I would definitely recommend both the hammock and Designed for Outdoors."
3,Interesting insights,Nice video to learn more about the current TDF winner. I have a lot of respect for Cadel after this year's efforts.
3,Good for a quick read,"This is definitely a must-have for the devoted Hagaren fan, but it can wear a little thin if you're expecting to read something above middle-school reading level. Inoue succeeded in keeping the characters true to Arakawa's descriptions, and the translator did a worthy job as well, but the language is so simple that the book can be easily read under a couple of hours.The translator unfortunately made some errors concerning Hawkeye that would drive the anal-retentive fan (ie me) insane. We all know that Hawkeye is a First Lieutenant, yet she is regularly refferred to as ""Captain"". It's even worse in the second novel where she starts out being a 1st lieutenant, but is randomly promoted to Captain, and then demoted back to 1st Lieutenant. Viz could use a little work with their editing, methinks."
5,Buy it. Buy it now!,"I really enjoyed this book. I prefer it over the first one, but mainly because this one is truly new content. If you follow the anime, you already know the plot for the first book from some of the early episodes. It's certainly an easy read, but there's nothing wrong with that. Plus, pretty much everything I've read that has been translated from Japanese reads this way. It's no less enjoyable for that. The character interactions are a bit off from my impression of the characters from the anime and manga, but not so far off as to be distracting. It's a must have if you are a fan of FMA."
4,FMA Vol 2 The Abducted Alchemist... fine book,"Makoto Inoue does a fine job with this one too, and I really enjoyed it. But I felt that something was missing that couldn't get me right ""into"" the book. I was hoping for some plot twists.Anyway, it's very good and entertaining, recommended for FMA fans. Loved the first one much more, though."
4,FNP exam prep,"This book has lots of great example questions for the NP exam. There are explanations for all of the questions that let you know why a certain answer is ""more"" correct than another one. My husband and I both used this book as prep for the ANCC exam. It's a very useful tool."
5,Great review book!,"I just got finished taking my Adult NP certification exam with the AANP and I think that this book was EXTREMELY helpful! I did use a couple other books and did the Fitzgerald Review but this was in my opinion the best for me! There are a ton of questions and it is so helpful to see the rationale. By the way, I passed... that is why I am recommending this so highly!!! :)"
4,Great Q/A book!!!,"This book served as an excellent addition to my study material. I had completed the Fitzgerald review course (Highly recommended!) and ordered this book to supplement my study. It was GREAT! It is a truely Question/Answer book. Questions on the front of the page and answers on the back. It also included 4 practice exams. They were very tough exams and made me really dig for the answer. Very similar to the boards!!Great at teaching you how to eliminate answers.I would highly recommend this book for anyone sitting for the Adult/Family boards.By the way, I passed my boards--and this book helped!"
3,Just okay,What I like: variety of questions that were not touched upon in the APEA review book. Good rationales given for correct answers.What I don't like: No separate section on pediatric questions. How can you have an FNP exam prep with no peds? Would have liked more questions in each section. There are about 30 questions per section/disorder topic.
5,Great resource for studying!,"I used this book of exam questions and explanations from cover to cover along with the Margaret Fitzpatrick NP Study Review Course for a month prior to taking the AANP exam. I passed and felt I learned so much through this process. This book could probably be a little more current, yet I found so much information that certainly doesn't change from year to year with practice theory, assessment, and care. A stressful process and exam!"
4,family nurse practitioner certificate prep exam,"it was good, but a little easy. I liked how the answers gave you much more than just the correct answers (they also gave you a little more info that could increase your knowledge about the topic). however, I would recommend for an NP prep guide the following: Family nurse practitioner, certification review by Kidd, Robinson and Kish. this one is much harder but I think it will prepare me for the final exam!"
4,Good study tool,"This book was full of challenging questions and was a useful and helpful study tool. Fitzgerald's was by far the best, but this was a good addition to practicing test questions. I used 4 practice question books and would rate this as #2 out of the 4."
2,Not the best Lurrie Bell,"This is not the best Lurrie Bell record, by far. The heavy-handed, slick production and over-funky band really gets in the way of what Lurrie does best, which is play straight-ahead blues guitar. Check out his releases on Delmark instead..."
4,Great product!!!!,"I liked this drink, but not as much as I liked all the other flavors of Big Train iced coffee. However, if you like the malt flavor this won't disappoint.Take care, TJ"
3,Not as pretty as seems.,I found this not as good as the picture. I thought the blue in the picture was breath taking but the ring it's self is dull.
3,One wash and the initially luxuriant appearance is gone,"The sheets (and accompanying pillowcases) look great -- when they're just out of the package. Luxuriant and classy. But after one wash, they are starting to look like my cheaper sheets. The initial sateeny gloss just washes away. Alas, that was also true of the 500TC pillowcases from SmartBargains.com, but at least they keep their hefty yet smooth feel. Only the Joseph Abboud (sp?) sheets from SmartBargains.com [without pillowcases], of the ones I've tried so far, have really kept their elegance after washing.So: a rating of 5 before use and wash, a rating of 1-2 after. Average: 3."
2,"Nice sheet, not durable.","I have purchased 2 top sheets and one fitted, king size white. They are nice and quite confortable. I am afraid to report that after washing them 4 times (machine wash, cold water delicate cyle and tumble dry low) both top sheets presented small holes. This is quite disappinting!"
3,"Buy a size larger than your bed, there is a reason these sheets are $9.99","I read the other reviews about how these sheets didn't fit well. Then I realized this was probably why they were reduced in price.I simply bought Cali/King for my king mattress and they fit fine. So, buy a size ""up"" and tuck if you have to. The bargain is great!To avoid shrinking, wash in cold water and line dry if you can. If you machine dry them it's best if you use a cool setting. This does help them retain their finish & fit.If you treat them like typical sheets and throw them in the washer & dryer on ""Hot""... Well, you'll get what you paid $9.99 for."
3,About these sheets...,"It's just OK. I love the periwinkle color, but the sheet tends to attract lint and pills up a bit after a few washes. I also have this sheet in 360 thread count and would recommend that; the 360 is much better."
4,Great sheets for the price,"I bought 4 fitted and 4 flat sheets back on 2004. Though they are thinner than most sheets, they have remained very soft and smooth. I have had no pilling and no shrinking in almost eight years of use. While some have been retired due to rips and tears, two sets still remain."
1,Awful pilling,These sheets felt nice to begin with but began pilling within a couple weeks of use and after a few months I have finally given up on them because they are so scratchy.
2,Very Hot,"The product smells nice, but if you have sensitive skin...Do Not Use This Product!!! I had to take 4 showers to stop the burning."
5,Great CD,"De CorazónThe CD arrived in a timely manner and in great shape. I recommend this CD and artist if you have never heard of Gilberto Santa Rosa.The CD includes early songs and later in his career as a singer, yet his songs here are timeless. They call Gilberto the gentleman of Salsa for a reason, he is awesome."
5,"What a great CD! Intimate, Energized, & Sexy","This CD is one of my very favorites - Red Velvet Slide has such great style & talent. Their music is intimate without being sleepy. There is a lot of great energy in every track. I've listened to this disc on road trips, painting a room, and while entertaining friends... it is always the perfect sound. The lyrics will really grab you and the music is incredible. Monsoon is a passionate CD that I highly recommend!"
5,Already purchased another set!,"Very good quality. Purchased another set after using a pair for my other car. These do not get rusted, even when my car is full of road salt."
3,Serviceable and Sharp,"I bought a new car back in May but didn't want to be a moving advertisement for the dealership, so I needed something simple that wouldn't rust to frame my plates. These are cheap and thin, but for the price I don't see anything better. They've been on my car for six months now, and they still look new. Granted I take good care of my car so your mileage may vary, but they're not broken or rusted. I was worried at first because the cut edges on the back of the plate sit directly on the paint, but I put on some of those little cabinet door protector nubs and they've stayed on fine, protecting my paint. I wouldn't affix this without them, unless you don't mind scratches."
3,Good frame for the money but.....,"In photos, this frame looks exactly like the one I purchased for my wife's car for $25 online. Well, it is the same design but the metal is much less thick. Not to say, it's flimsy, but I'm sure it wouldn't hold up to being bumped by another car. But at that price I can always get another one. It's just the front one that might be in jeopardy."
3,Mixed Results,"The quality varies widely among these units. I own two of them. One is set up for a really tremendous amount of gain and consequently blew its metering circuit soon after being put into service. The other came new in the box with a defective meter but has gain more in line with what one would expect in this type of preamp. Engaging the OPL circuit or not makes no discernible difference in the metering function or much of anything else.The high gain ""version"" (I use the term loosely) can of course introduce a lot of noise into the signal. The more typical unit operates very quietly. It is easy to open the case on the Tube MP for exchange of tubes but good luck getting it properly closed again.For $30 or so, it is potentially a useful device in a home studio, especially if you want to supply phantom power to a condenser mic. The Tube MP is a better phantom power supply than most other devices in its price range. However, be prepared for anything."
5,can't beat the value,"This is perfect for what I wanted - a tube preamp to give a little color to my condensor. It also works great to add a little crunch to my guitar (I mic my amp with a Nady ribbon mic, and it also helps to boost the signal for when I don't want to make my roommates hate me). I did swap out the tube it came with for a Sovtek tube that was in my bass head (I put a Groove tube in the bass head), and that was easy to do, but the stock tube sounded good as well. For $30, any home recordist could almost not afford to not buy this."
2,Hum Drum,"It's good preamp, it really boosted my signal, which is what I wanted it to do, but it recorded such a loud hum that my recordings were useless."
4,Use it properly and it'll do good,There's a proper way in using preamps and this ART TUBE MP module makes it so easy for amateurs. Too bad they had to discontinue this particular model. Get it while stock lasts at Amazon. Pay no more than $30 for this.
4,Great product!,"This works better than expected. clear audio and good amp. 4 because it runs pretty hot, so that worries me a bit. Hot enough that it melted the glue holding the foot pads, and started to slide a little bit."
2,Too Much Hum,"I like the warmth that the preamp adds, but the 60hz hum at any setting is excessive. Yes, I tried changing cables, checked and rechecked connections. If you're thinking maybe I got a defective one, well, possibly. If that's so then the my 2-star rating goes towards poor quality control."
3,"I loved it, but it died ~5 months later","I loved it for recording. I had a sm58, but it just didn't have enough gain on my tascam USB-224 audio interface. So I bought a MXL V63M condenser mic and the Tube MP pre-amp. Great sounding combination, really helped to improve my recording quality. Bought it 11/24/07. Last night (04/17/08), I went to use it and -- no power! Bummer. Now, I have to check if it is under warranty and see about a replacement. Cheap and effective -- but if it dies this early, then the lower cost is now offset by all the replacement hassles. Heck if I have to drive to guitar center (it was shipped from Musician's friend) there's $15-20 in gas. Dang, back to the sm58 for awhile.Kevin"
2,Not much of an preamp,I bought some flat piano pickup mic's and attached then to the underside of our church piano. I installed this preamp to them and ekkk the noise coming from the mic's was terrible. I did everything I could to clean up the sound but to no avail. I finally just had to remove this preamp from the system and there it sits till it goes on Ebay as I have no use for it.
1,Worked OK - until it stopped powering on.,"After about 3 moths into owning, it stopped powering on all together. The AC adapter seems OK when testing with other devices. No lights, sound - nothing. A quick cruise through various forums and it looks like these cheaper ART units are rife with issues. So just know that you get what you pay for in this instance.So, it's back for RMA."
3,Sounds great! Until the tube goes in a few months. :(,"This device has a tube in it which will go out after a few months of HEAVY use. I ran it 12 hours a day, at least 5 days a week. As soon as I get a new tube, I'll side grade the unit for occasional ""special use"".It really does sound great, but keep in mind, tubes don't live for ever."
1,hmmmmmmm,looks good. feels good but it is a hummer on sensitive electronics. tried using it with a heil mic on a icom ic2820h and it is not good. for the price i tossed it and will buy a solid state unit that runs on DC only. no AC no hum. to bad it want a hummer. those are good
1,poor performance,"i know in a low price product ...if you just want that ""dirty vintage noise"" of analog machines you can use it for thatit`s no good enough for make a decent recording ..."
4,Works well and price is good!,"I needed a mic preamp and after visiting local music stores, I had reached the conclusion that I just couldn't afford one. I saw this and decided to take a chance. And it paid off.This preamp works well for me. I have been impressed with the performance. It is well constructed and well worth the price. This one is a keeper."
2,Too noisy,"Sorry, can't use it... i did buy two of these and both are just too noisy. I replaced them with a Golden Age Pre-73 and it was night and day as far as noise levels. The Golden Age is silent.Can't say it's worth even using it for any purpose really. I also bought the Rolls and it was quicker."
2,"barely so, so....","if you can find it for less than 35 dollars,think of it as an interesting toy or experiment boxto do the folloiwng.......stick in your geetar, synths, bass,etc...or any line level source....... most DYNAMIC mics and a few cheap Ribbon mics, get some boost...NOT recommended for most all condenser mics...yes, you will get CONSTANT hissing sound...making the s/n appear tobe around 60-70dB...or so...butyou do get a CHANGE in sound character...sometimes, good, sometimes not.depends on mic or input.sothats what it is.maybe have a bit of fun with it.most mics, even if you record the results...with and withoutthis box,,, u will hardly be able to discern the diffference for most of youexcept for Definite addition of hissing noise... due to bad passive parts anddesign mostly...butit can be fun.see u."
4,Cheaper than Rockbox,I attached my microphone to RCA A/V receiver without any problem. It is mono though--only left speaker has sound.I recomend my friend to attach her microphone to RCA of TV.
1,Hmmmmmmm.,"Reviews I found online suggested that these units were prone to hum, and yes this one did. I returned it and bought the ART Tube MP Project instead."
3,Got a defective one: Humming all the time at any settings.,"I'm a singer...Just hooked it up, (I'm a technology kid as well) anyways, I hooked it up correctly, heard the mic on play back, didn't touch any button or knob, just a bit on the input and output and I heard a terrible humming noise via Audacity Sound software. Eventually I heard it on playback via headphones.I must have gotten a defective unit which is sad because I really had high hopes and high hopes of making my singing covers sound better/warmer. Hope that my exchange that I get in a week or two works perfectly... I have a tight budget but come on don't fail!!!"
5,a great resource,"I have just gotten familiar with the wide variety of hostas when we recently did some landscaping. This is an excellent, outstanding, fantastic book to use. And at a great price through Amazon."
4,an informative work but not an encyclopedia,"The author makes a concerted effort to bring to you the vast numbers of hostas available today in a concise way. The book is designed to assist you in finding the hosta that best suites your needs. It does not meet the definition of an Encyclopedia, the species and cultivars are not arranged alphabetically, however in alphabetical order by the way they look, an informative work but not an encyclopedia. So the name of the book is yet another marketing ploy. For me, I can only use the book by way of index. It does have some information that's hard to find elsewhere. They make a darn good hit at getting info on some of the best hostas available and some that are barely available. It is not a five star book but it is a solid four star. The pictures woo the ladies but men want content, we know that a hosta may only look that way for one week in spring."
4,"Hostas, a bargain","This book is a valuable asset for every Hosta collector. Moreover, it is much cheaper than if I had bought it in Europe, where the price is 50 !Thank you Amazon.com"
1,book resources,"Hi, this is Shirley Lynn Scott. Just saw this review, and want to point out my Crime Library article on Mary Bell was written in 2000. If this book was written in 2004, then the author may have unfortunately relied on my article without proper reference. I'll have to check it out. Thanks!"
1,Terrible,"No wonder the author didn't put his name on this book. I wouldn't wnt my name on it either.In addition to several typos and grammatical errors, the language is misleading. It's like reading an opinion piece, not a factual account. The author often ignores or barely seems to comprehend abnormal pathology.I'm embarassed that I bought this book and hope that my psychology teacher never finds out. Wikipedia is a better source than this."
2,Not too exciting,The music is bad - real bad. I had to run at 2X speed without sound to get through most of them. As a film student I wanted to explore early film and try to see the roots of development and experimentation.I was disappointed in most of the movies as I was looking for early innovations in film making. I only saw them in Manhatta and H2O. These two made the disk purchase acceptable.Manhatta has some innivative shots and lighting study. It was able to tell a story of greatness without words in spite of the terrible music. Interesting early camera placement and angles.H2O had some fascinating play with light and water reflections. I was mesmerized.
3,Kino's scores suck,"The musical accompaniment for most of these seminal avant-garde films is very bad. A previous reviewer mentioned that it was done by ""the best in the business."" Well, I am of the opinion that, unfortunately, there are not enough interesting minds in that business (silent film scoring), or at least not enough employed by Kino Video, to make for a competent collection.There is electric guitar (Creed-style riffing!!!). There is arbitrary ""Frenchy"" sounding music. And yes, there is even some dreaded Casio keyboard ""vox"" effect.Who could possibly think that keyboard ""vox"" was a good idea? Not me.These films, like all those Kino releases, are rare and under-appreciated, and worth owning on DVD because this is the only way you'll get them. I only wish Kino appreciated them enough to pair the films with either a) historically accurate or b) competent scores."
5,You got to read it!,"It was one of the most powerful stories i have ever read. i have not seen the movie before, but the book was great. Sister Helen Prejean's outlook on the Death Penalty made me relate to her. I never really understood what the death penalty really stood for, now I know. i understand executions and the ""revenge"" which we justify by labeling it ""justice."" And it is very VERY devastating and sad...but we are only human. I am strongly against the Death Penalty due to moral issues and I believe EVERYONE should get there hands on a book like this. Even if you don't agree with my opinion, at least it provides an overlooked aspect of the death penalty. As the adage goes ""ignorance is bliss"" but then again, so is death. This is one of the greatest books i have ever read. It is a fast read. You may even shed a few tears when you get to the end - like I did. I hope everyone will read this book and enjoy it as much as I did."
5,Must read for all Americans,"An excellent overview of Capitol Punishment in the United States. Helen PreJean details her dealings with death row inmates, offers vital statistics and accounts of the cases. If you believe in the death penalty, read this book... you may very well change your mind."
3,The movie was better,"The movie, which I loved, inspired me to buy this book. Book was OK and, of course, had room for the intellectual arguments against the death penalty but I found it lacked the emotional resonance of the movie. I also dropped the book about half way through for a month. Something about the writing didn't grab me -- Sr. Prejean's tendency to repeat herself and to telegraph her punches?"
5,Not Always Innocent,"My friend was also raped by this monster.He was not the man the movie descibed him as being.He was GUILTY and he was a brutal demon, not his friend as the movie and book tries to make you believe.If this was your daughter, wife, sister, friend, etc. would you feel sorry for him? I think not. He is in hell, where he belongs."
2,Keep on killing them!,"I have been reading true crime stories for over a decade, and after reading over one hundred of these books I became a staunch death penalty supporter. This book was presented to me by someone who disagreed with me, who thought that reading it might change my mind. It hasn't. Sister Helen is obviously a very dedicated individual and I commend her for her passion and respect her views, like I do anyone else's, but I feel that she is simply wasting her precious time with these inmates, time that could better be spent with children to ensure that they themselves don't wind up on death row one day. These vile, inhumane creatures chose to do what they did, so let them suffer the consequences. If one of the consequences is death, so be it. If they are prepared to take someone else's life, then they should pay with their own, and it is about time that the rights of the innocent victims of crime and potential victims are placed ahead of the predators."
5,Touching story,"This is a very touching story and for those who saw the film, it will be interesting to know it from Helen Prejean's point of view."
1,I really really dispize this nun!!!,"I am against capital punishment. But this NUN could give a damn about the victims. So whatever she has to say in this book just resulted in me hurling this waste of paper at the fireplace. Yes, I know everyone has a right to thier opinion. So Sister Helen has a right to hers even though she a holier-than-thou (fill-in-the-blank). So, I'll step down from the pulpit now...."
1,this book sucked,this book was too hard to understand and too hard to follow. I would not recomend this book to anybody.
4,"""Books to Check Out"" is the Book to Buy","I always seem to find books I want to read before I find the money to buy them. This little book is great because I can write down the title and author to remember it later. I don't have any problem with the amount of space in it. I think the makers of the book intended users to use as many lines as they need to write down titles. In addition to being useful, this journal is also pretty cute. I keep it with me in my purse all the time."
3,Books to Check Out Journal,"Things that I like about this book:- Pages are thick and great for writing on.- I love the size. Small enough to be out of the way, big enough to write in.Things I didn't like:- There are ""Chapters"". Books To Read, Favorite Books/Passages, and Books Borrowed/Lent.- Coupled with the fact that the book has a ""T"" style grid inside. Either you ignore the line in the middle of the page and write over it, or you don't have enough room to right out an entire passage.All in all, though, I do use and like this book."
3,A good idea but...,"I saw this on Amazon and liked the idea. I found this book at the local Borders store and looked through it. There were a few similar books that I also looked at but none of them fit my needs exactly. They all have too many categories,some of which I would never use, such as books lent and book club. Also, there is limited space to write in entries.So, instead, I purchased a small blank journal. This book is the same size as the others and it's much more pleasing to look at. There is a ribbon book-mark and an elastic band to hold the book closed. A pocket on the inside of the back cover is the perfect place for keeping my Borders rewards card, bookstore gift cards, and coupons. The only problem is that I was so excited about starting my lists that I didn't properly plan out how I wanted my books organized."
5,Adorable,"Any kid would love this toy. I bought it as a gag gift (see [...]), but it's almost too cute to give away. I'm seriously considering getting another, just to have one of my own.As for the toy itself, it's very plush. It's definitely a cuddly toy, and is safe enough for a small child to use. It's well made, and even the eyes are well-detailed. I definitely recommend it."
4,A distinctly modern-sounding voice from 400 AD,"This translation and commentary offers a significant glimpse into early Christianity, written around 400 AD by the articulate churchman Pelagius, who was later denounced for opposing Augustine's doctrine of original sin. Here we have an interpretation of Paul's letters as many early leaders viewed them. Paul's praise of female church leaders is affirmed rather than corrected: ""even today women deaconesses in the east are known to minister to their own sex in baptism, or in the ministry of the Word"". (p. 150-151) Freedom is upheld as a Christian value, not deplored as a sin. Basically, Pelagius sounds far more like a modern Christian than his detractors. He is also more in tune with the expansive spirit of primitive Christianity.-author of Correcting Jesus"
3,Beautiful Photos,"If you are looking for inspirational photos of gifts, this book is for you. I was impressed with the quality and number of different photos Carolyne added to this book. The book fell short for me because it wasn't descriptive enough. I wanted more step-by-step guidance."
4,Great book but expensive,"This is a beautiful book with very clear instructions for each beautiful project and with wonderful pictures. It gets the creative juices flowing. However, it is expensive for a one-time read."
1,Pretty photos but no ideas or instructions!,"I love Carolyne...and have been dying to get my hands on this book. Unfortunately, there was nothing here in terms of step by step or---actually---any instructional text at all. It was all like, ""I love green and purple together"" followed by a gorgeous photo.I was expecting some fresh ideas and also steps on actually creating what's in the book."
3,Gift Wrapping NOT on a Budget,"There are beautiful things in this book, just like there are beautiful things in Tiffany's. The materials used in this book are absolutely extravagant, and if you have the time to find them and the money to buy them, I say do it! But most of us do not have the means to buy outrageously expensive paper and fabric to wrap stuff in. To be fair, anything looks good in swathed in luxurious material. But it would have been more helpful to have a book that used simple items to create spectacular wrapping. That's creativity."
5,Seriously awesome shorts,"I'm in a hurry, but these things rock. Buy them, you will not be disappointed. Quality cloth (light, airy, and soft) and good workmanship, good comfortable fit."
3,Izod mens shorts,"I thought I was buying the IZOD pleated microfiber ""GOLF"" shorts with the expandable waist, but not so. They are not what I wanted, but they are OK."
3,stone dust pleated shorts,Shorts were made in Cambodia. Material is soft and feels light and has a microfiber texture.the sitching around the waistband is sloppy.I am somewhat satisfied
1,:(,"Christian has a past that has kept him from his hime town and his family, but now he is back. He is enchanted by his new secretary, Emily. Emily and Christian are drawn to each other in every way. Emily, however, starts to have doubts about the man she is starting fall in love with when everyone in town, including her own friends warn her away from him. The stories of his past are not pretty, but she can also see Christians side of things. Her doubts about Christian are more closer to home when the beautiful housekeeper makes no secret of her affair with Christian. Emily seems to find the man guilty without even asking him about it.The story falls flat. It was hard to become interested in the characters. Christian seems hard and closed off. Emily is fickle and a bit weak. It was hard to imagine the two of them together."
5,Tastes Great,"I bought these for some camping food and they have exceeded my expectations. All you need is some hot water, let it sit for about 10 minutes and it's ready to go. The only complaint is the price, so I can't afford to buy many of them, but if want something that's easy to make, feeling lazy or just want to spoil yourself with something that tastes great they are a great item to have."
3,Masterpiece deserves better mastering,"This is a timeless classic of very heavy and unique rock form the early eighties that features Chris D.'s incredible vocal preformance; maybe his best, maybe tied with ""Forever Came Today"". The compositions, the band, are all top flight. Unfortunately, this CD sounds like it was mastered from a scratchy Lp! Not even a good Lp. Some of it is bad enough to be distracting, and that is way too much. The bonus material, which is excellent, sounds much better than the original Lp material. A sky full of stars for the music; a cloudy starless night for the sonic presentation."
5,One of my favorite albums,"In my opinion, this is the Flesh Eaters at their best. And one of my favorite albums still today. This cd includes bonus tracks which are JUST AS GOOD as the material on the original album... which was better than 99% of the stuff that is coming out today that wants do much to be like this, but never can.All you young ""punk"" and ""alternative"" bands can choke on this band's dust left for you... cause obviously most of you never even took the time.This is one hell of a band, one hell of a singer/songwriter, and one of the best albums ever made."
2,Crappy Quality and Shameful Support,"FIRST AND FOREMOST: The content is spectacular, as you probably know. The package is terrific, with a high quality booklet with character studies and background art.THAT SAID: Several of the discs don't work -- they freeze, stall or don't load. I tried my computer, my cheap dvd, and a friend's top-of-the-line Denon. The vendor replaced it once cheerfully, then refused to do so again [did offer refund]. Warner Bros videos sent me a blow-off reply saying they didn't manufacture it and didn't sell it, so they won't support it. The manufacturer? Who knows and who can tell. It's not listed.AND OF COURSE: My favorite episodes are on discs that don't work on either of the two packages I have.IT MAY BE WORTH A TRY: But be ready to return it."
4,gift,"it's hard for me to write a review on this product as it is a gift. as long as the recipient is happy, i'm happy"
1,WAY OVER PRICED,They were selling this for 90$s! Now it's over 200$?! WHAT?!? You can buy the separate seasons for like 15$s each totaling to 60$ To have basically the same thing. Why would I pay more than double to have the same thing?
5,Superb series!!,"The animation is top notch, and so are the scripts, the performances and the music. This is a landmark in T.V cartoons, because this will not only appeal to children but to adults as well.Besides buying this set which includes the complete series in such an elegant presentation and at such affordable price is a no-brainer.A must for anyone remotely interested in animation or super-heroes."
4,Gold Standard of Batman animation,"If you are a true fan of Batman, this is the series/boxed set you must own. The stories are true to the Batman ethos and the graphics are stunning. Not a little kids cartoon."
5,"Great price, perfect condition","Not much to say. Got it for about 5 dollars over the price I last saw it, though it had been out of production for months so of course there's some mark-up. Compared to the others though the price was great and I got it with no damage at all and still in shrink wrap."
5,Fantastic Package,"Others have reviewed Batman TAS in detail, but I just received the Complete Animated series and have to comment on the packaging . It is the nicest, most extensive package I have ever seen for an animated show and the scrapbook it includes, while not long, is a fun read. Furthermore, this package includes all the extras from the previous releases plus an additional DVD. For most movies I find the special features and commentary to be dull, but the creators commentaries for this are a treat for fans like myself. At this low price, any fan of the series should pick it up immediately."
5,What a wonderful bra!,"I found this Olga bra at a discounter, but there were only two in my size. Couldn't find it at a department store, but thankfully Amazon has it in my size and an array of colors, so I've ordered more. This bra is blissfully comfortable. The fabric is silky. The straps are padded, which is mandatory for me since I have a problem with one of my shoulders. The wide band has three hooks, and stretches all ways for total comfort. It's tagless. I'm not constantly tugging on this bra, it actually stays in place! Love it!"
2,Straps are really long,"The actual bra is pretty good. The problem is that the straps, even when adjusted to smallest, are very long. This defeats the idea of holding the ""girls"" up in place. I now know what the joke about being a 36 long refers to. Only buy this model if you are handy and can shorten straps."
3,olga bra,"Its. a good bra, but i need a padded bra and this one only had pads around the underwire. Overall its commfortable and a really good bra."
2,MZB fanatic begs to disagree,"I can't believe the reviews I just read. I'm a Marion Zimmer Bradley fanatic -- AND a lesbian, so don't think it was the theme that threw me -- and I HATED ""The Catch Trap"". It's one of the four worst books I've ever read (the other three being ""Sar"", ""Unbalanced"" by Lass Small, and all that ""Magic's Prattle"" garbage by Mercedes Lackey). If you like lots of badly written melodrama and angst, this book is for you. Two closeted gay men who happen to be circus performers stagger around feeling tortured because they scarcely dare love each other. This doesn't even succeed as soft porn. Bad, bad, bad. Go read ""Mists of Avalon"" or ""The Shattered Chain"" to get the taste of this awful, awful novel out of your mouth."
3,Boring! Bad! Poor Closet Cases!!,"This book has got to be one of the worst Novels I've ever read about gay men. Being a gay man I would never be in a relationship as bad as these two had. Talk about two closet cases. What a mess. Then they decied it's time to move on because they didn't get along..well, several years later they meet up again, one has spent a few years in the army..don't ask don't tell...the other got married, and while he's married..they start up again. And it's like reading the same thing over and over again, they fight...have sex....they fight....have sex....they fight...have sex...please!!! Do yourself a favor don't read this book. If you want to read a great gay novel read The Front Runner...one of the best!! Marion stick to Avalon..leave the gay writing to the Gay Writers who know what they are writing about!!!!!"
1,"Horrible, Trite, Smarmy and Forgettable","As a gay man, I really looked forward to ""The Catch Trap"" as one of the few love stories that would really speak to me. Instead, I found a book full of unbelievably shallow and sacharine characters with little to no appeal.Aside from the circus setting, I found the two main characters so stereotypically sappy as to be laughable in all the wrong places. I felt insulted at every turn of the page as the two boys/men toggled between love and hatred of themselves and each other.Admittedly, I'm no fan of Bradley's writing, and ""The Catch Trap"" is the perfect example of why. While I understand from many a friend I've discussed this with that I'm of a minority opinion here, I can't help but recommend that this book NOT be read...by anyone."
5,One of my all-time favourites,"This book is certainly one of the best books I have ever read -- and I have read it at least 3 times. Zimmer Bradley really did her homework. The atmosphere in the book is beautifully depicted. You can almost smell the circus. You are drawn into the story, unable to put the book down.The love story between Tommy and Mario/Matt is essential, yet Zimmer Bradley manages to tell a gay love story in a way that appeals to everybody (who is without predjudices, that is of course). Longing, the difficulties of growing up, beauty, ambition, loss and sacrifices that need to be made mix together and really make you suffer and ""live"" with the characters.I was 14 when I first read the book, and still now, at the age of 25, I love it.The German translation is very good as well, by the way :-)."
4,"Melodramatic, but engaging","I really don't understand the hate some feel for this book. It accurately depicts the angst of the closet at that time. The gymnastics, the ethnic passion, and the romance may be over the top for those expecting a contemporary attitude, but I enjoyed it a lot. I've read it twice. The protagonists are sexy, conflicted and defiant, eventually. It's one of the great 'old style' gay novels. I don't know why it hasn't been made into a film, not that that justifies a novel's quality."
2,Emmanuelle Trilogy Censored,These movies have been censored - which are a shame. The original movies had more scenes than the ones in this setNadim
1,Got wrong item,"I ordered the Fiesta cinnabar cereal bowl to replace a broken one. What I got was a chocolate color small bowl, not even close to what was pictured. The chocolate color bowl is much smaller than the cereal bowls, I don't know why they advertise one thing and send out another, but I've noticed other reviews say the same thing.Since those reviews are no longer here, I assume they just relist to get fresh reviews. I'd send it back but I've already spend almost six dollars on shipping and sending it back would cost more that what the bowl is worth. Guess I'll use it for the cat's food."
1,"Did this listing say ""used""?","The cardboard box these came in had obviously been opened before and closed with scotch tape. The carrying case was damaged. It had a big rip on the left side that meant that the cardboard ""wall"" on that side fell out. The dominoes were okay, but it looks like they may be a used set that someone bound with cheap shrink wrap.I got these dominoes for myself as a little Christmas present. I'm really glad that I wasn't planning to give these to someone else. I would've been really embarassed."
3,"Large enough but a little ""chintzy""",The costume fit fine...even ran a little large but it is definitely NOT a high quality product...served its purpose for a one day event.
4,Amazing Easy Recipes,I bought this for my wifes' birthday. She watches Paula on the food network often and really likes her style. My wife has made a few of the dishes from this book and they are really great. Easy to make and easy to clean up (thats my job). I highly recommend this book for the cook who wants to try something new.
3,"Not bad, but . . .","I love Paula Deen's show on Food Network so I was looking forward to receiving this cook book. I was disappointed however, that most of the ingredients she uses in these particular recipes are pre-made. Reminds of ""semi-homemade"" and I don't like to cook that way. I use raw, unprocessed ingredients in my cooking so this wasn't what I wanted.It reminds me of the recipes you get from Kraft, CoolWhip, and others. There are a few I might try, but overall, I didn't find it a great cookbook."
3,Lady and Sons cookbook set,I watch Paula Deen's show on TV and love it. But I was disappointed in the cookbooks. The recipes are packed with fat and not a good choice for people who have high cholesterol or those who are watching their fat intake.
2,Ladies and son,"I was suppose to receive The ladies and son,too! The book A whole new batch of recipes from Savannah, I never received. I got the first book,very nice, Like I said I never recieved the second book. Then I got an e-mail saying it had been sent back from someone else to Amazon.My credit card was credited for it. So I probably will have to re-order or buy somewhere else."
4,The Lady and Sons too.,"I live in England and so had never heard of Paula Deen before. She was recommended to me by an American friend in California, so i thought i'd check her out. I found that in this book, although the recipes look really homey and good, and they are pretty simple, they are for huge amounts of people! I had to reduce everything down from like 10-12 people to 4 as i do not have that many people in my family! I did find it difficult when it came to the branded seasonings, but got my friend to tell me how to make a substitute, so it went fine. I would recommend this book because it is simple home cooking for the normal person, not the experienced chef! The terminology she uses is easy to understand, and her story in the beginning is so sad."
5,Something of a winner here!,"Seems the buzz is all about this book and for good reason. Clearly written (crappy cover from Putnam) and full of insight and wisdom, I couldn't put this puppy down. Why isn't this on the bestseller lists? Why didn't the publisher push this title, instead of letting it languish, as they obviously did? Well, that aside, it was worth every penny and its a lot cheaper to buy it online than go to a bookstore, where it generally can't be found."
1,This book was the worst book I have ever read.,I do not know what people are thinking when they give this book a positive review. I could hardly force myself to finish it and I wouldn't have if it wasn't this months book group selection. What terrible writing! Did this guy have an editor? If you like metaphysical fiction stick with Richard Bach or Mary Summer Rain or any number of authors who know how to write. I cannot express more strongly how much I hated this book.
3,"Finally, A decent piece of Fiction!!","Although this book strays far from actual history or reality, the author, Bradley, certainly has a knack for this ""new age"" fantasy. It was very enjoyable reading, written by the Maharaja himself!!Splendid Cover!!! Our hats are off to the designer for such a piece of art."
2,"Fun reading, Awful writing","This book is a ride into New Age make believe that was enjoyable, however, it was horribly written. You are able to see how this author is good at STORY telling with an imagination to match by visiting his web site. I liked the parts about ""Don't sleep with your students"", as well as his paranoid delusions with the FBI, CIA, UFO's, and so on.I have never experienced so much hatred as he has posted on his sight yet he claims higher spirituality.Well... the book was interesting as well as the author (A typical ""New Age"" writer dealing with his own contradictions of spirituality and real life aplication). Someone should let him know the new age movement removed itself from any credible social ranking with the types of people it attracted and thier exhibition of genius. (Cults, Suicides, FRAUDS)......hey DB?.Thank Heavens you know where to go to find the mentally unbalanced, but who would really want to? Lets just keep them corralled up!!"
4,Great Subwoofer Cable!!!,"Great product! Connects good to both the subwoofer and the surround decoder. Good sound output with no interference or distortion or humming. The length is also modest enough to reach towards the back of the room if you are planning to put the subwoofer there. However, you would need to measure the distance of the subwoofer properly. This cable is only 25feet and reaches the back of a small to medium-sized room. For bigger rooms consider longer cables."
4,Great value,"This cable works exactly as good as any decent cable. The ends are tight and secure, the shielding is good, and it's just long enough to place the subwoofer anywhere in the room. The THX certification gives me confidence that the signal is being transmitted without any loss or interferance."
5,direct useability of text,"This book offers clinical critiques of actual cases using a teaching format which defines each case presented with the type of therapy theory employed by the therapist. My personal favorite is chapter 8, ""Fat Lady"" by Irvin D. Yalom. It is existentialism at its brutally honest best, and shows clearly the human side of the therapist's countertransference and growth through that countertransference. I found this book to be quite an asset for understanding the practical differences between the various counseling theories. It greatly compliments and illustrates the theories in a very readable context."
3,Very Difficult text to read,This text in my opinion was a very difficult text to read and i found the chapters to be too lengthy. Can be a turn off for beginning students.
5,"Makes a Lovely Cup of Tea, Indeed","I love this stuff. I'd been drinking Twinings English Breakfast for years. When my Mom asked for Christmas gift ideas last year, I mentioned loose tea and told her that was my favorite. I opened gifts on Christmas morning to find my first bag of Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea -- she hadn't been able to find Twinings loose leaf.I make it using an individual french press mug set (a Christmas gift from my brother a couple of years ago!), and it's the best tea I've ever had. I liked it so much I didn't even think twice about ordering the box of 6...and I may be asking for more by the time Christmas rolls around again!"
2,"OK, but not special","Taste very similar to Lipton's loose leaf tea. If you prefer the kind that looks more like chopped leaves than something that's been ground & almost looks like coffee, this isn't for you."
2,different listening,"I couldn't get into this, but I'm sure it's good. I gave it to a friend andshe liked it. Just not my type of book. More into thriller mysteries."
3,Great movie - horrible monster,"This movie had everything going for it as a low-key horror film. The acting, the direction, great plot, it's all there. But the CGI ""larva"" are so horribly, horribly rendered that it's hard to take any of the good parts of the movie seriously. There is no excuse for doing so much to make a good film and then making the most idiotic CGI creatures, they simply do not look remotely real."
2,Not every instrument in each song,"I bought this book to get arrangements for my bluegrass band. The tag line for this book is '...Arranged for Fiddle, Mandolin, Banjo, Buitar, Dobro and Bass'. I was very dissapointed to find that for most of the songs, there weren't any arrangement for Dobro at all - which makes it quite useless in my band setting.The CD contains the original recordings of the songs."
3,Easy for little guys,My son got this for Christmas and he played with it for about 30 mins. and it stopped working. We took it apart and the wires had melted. It might have just been a fluke. I wish it would of lasted longer because he really had fun with it.
1,Zero stars weren't an option,"Biddulph has not distinguished himself with this novel. Ideology trumps character and plot over and over in this ""novel"" approach to proselyting literature. Adventure, excitement, profundity? Nope.Mr. Biddulph should stick with his fundamentalist screeds on the anti-science, homophobic Meridian Magazine site, where poor writing and abysmal logic are rewarded."
4,Good overall review of pharmacy calculations,"This is a recommended textbook where I work. I like the fact that it teaches concepts vastly differently from the required textbook that I teach out of....Thus, students who are unable to understand one way may be able to understand after using this text. I also like that students can write and practice problems directly in this book."
4,I like it,"the book explains all the problems. THe answers are right after each set of porblems, not at the end. It is clear."
2,Hardly about Himmler,"I bought this DVD hoping that, since all the documentaries I've seen up to this point that have been supposedly about a said specific member of the party, or inner circle for that matter, generally tend to stray off topic, would actually be specifically about the person or at least give me new information that perhaps I didn't know and also in hopes that since it was so new would maybe even have new information but that was hardly the case.This DVD unfortunately (as most other Nazi related docs. tend to sway) Is mostly about the living conditions the jews had to endure in the camps etc. There are a few interesting aspects of it about the man himself but nothing I haven't read or seen somewhere else several times before.Comparatively, it's hardly about Himmler at all."
1,Heinrich Himmler Anatomy of a murder,This is a poor documentary. I think they wanted to do a documentary about Himmler after all they got his grand niece involved and then instead of getting an insight into his personal life they just blow over it. For instance he had a second wife and two children. He had and older and younger brother. You can learn more about Himmler by investing your money into buying Hitler's Bodyguard. I can't stress it enough this is a waste of time to watch you learn nothing.
4,"Heinrich Himmler, Anatomy of a Mass Murderer",Excellent insight into the mind of a mass murderer. This is an interesting film and very informative for any history buff.
1,Poorly written and very tedious,"This book appears to be very poorly written, I can only assume that English is not the native language of the author or that it was poorly translated because there were numerous typographical and grammatical errors. I found many irregularities and inconsistencies e.g. Johnny supposedly bought his flight ticket to Amsterdam in the United Kingdom and yet the price was given in Dollars ($90), suggesting that the author was unaware/ignorant of the local currency in that country (Pounds Sterling).The author claims that this is a travel novel about Amsterdam and yet he gives no insight into best tourist attractions etc. The novel focuses mainly on Johnny's obsession with women and gives the impression that he is completely socially inept.In my opinion this novel is best avoided as it gives no useful information about traveling in Amsterdam and focuses on relationships with women."
1,Excessively verbose and very tedious,"The style adopted by Kim is excessively verbose with very little descriptive information about the sites of interest in the Netherlands.The story tends to drag on and takes a long time to get anywhere. The main character in the story, Johnny, comes across as a philistine with extreme views i.e. anti-semitic. Johnny appears not to be interested in sampling the local cusine and sticks to fast food.The novel is full of errors e.g Rembrandtplatz instead of Rembrandtplein.If you want to read a good travel novel giving insight into the Netherlands then I recommend that you give this one a miss!"
1,Simply awful!,"This was the worst travel novel I've ever read. There was very little information about the Netherlands or Amsterdam, instead the novel focused on a series of puerile sexual encounters, based on the prurient fantasies of Kim.The main character, Johnny, came across as an uncultured idiot with an annoying propensity for being 'preachy' and overbearing. The storyline was very predictable and there were no twists and turns to keep the reader enthralled. I found many irregularities and inconsistencies e.g. Rembrantsplatz instead of Rembrantsplein.I would urge all readers to avoid this book; it really is appalling in every sense of the word."
1,A real disappointment,"As travel novels go, this was one of the worst I've read. The story line was predictable and boring with very little action to entertain the reader. After the first chapter I became bored with the constant inane dialogue from Johnny, the main character. I found Johnny a very irritating character, completely lacking in both culture and manners. Johnny spent most of his time forcing himself onto the local girls in the desperate hope that he could lure one into bed. The characters in general were unrealistic and readily divulged personal secrets to strangers. In reality it is very rare for anyone to tell a complete stranger such personal information.I found many errors e.g. street names in Dutch cities given fallacious names and basic typos such as one discovered by the first reviewer i.e. ""the music backend me"".I think that most readers will find this novel a terrible bore, therefore its better left on the shelf."
3,eh,"the studs are too far apart and the backside's not dyed black. It's barely long enough for my 6' 2"" self. If you're tall and like to hang your axe down around you knees it won't work for you. But hey, the price was right."
5,Magicians,"If you are a budding magician or someone who likes and appreciates ""real magic"", you'll love this book. The author takes great pains to explain how each trick is accomplished and better yet, he explains the entire process. Part of the mystique in performing any trick is the banter and body movements performed by the magician. Mr. Tyler explains how the entire ""performance"" is executed, not just the trick.I highly recommend this book as a personal reference book or a great gift that will be enjoyed by all. After you read it, you'll be hoping that there is another version in the works . . . gimme more!"
3,Basic Mathematics,Basic Mathematics is an informative textbook teaching the basics of mathematics. It has good examples and easy to understand explantations of fomulas. I would recommend this text as a refresher before jumping into a more complex subject.
4,Good book for someone who hasn't had math in over 20 years,This book is great with examples and practice problems and to top it off it has a cd with step by step instructions which is very helpful for refreshing your memory after being out of school for such a long time.
2,Nice but too old,"The book was in great shape and arrived as requested, the very next day, but it was too old an edition for the class I was taking"
1,Disappointed,"Bought the book used. VERY, VERY disappointed. The package came not completely secured. And half the book, the pages at the top were stuck together. While going through to unstick the pages from each other, alot of them got ripped or completely ruined. BEWARE of used books!"
1,Disappointed,"This movie lived up to what was written on the case, but was quite strange in its setting and was boring at times. We really didn't enjoy it and fast-forwarded through parts to see the conclusion. Conclusion was the best part. Disappointed."
1,waste of time,"I could watch Christmas movies year-round. From the description of reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. I love movies that encourage people to pull together, especially at Christmas. The plot was slow, the acting was terrible, and the story just never took off. Don't waste your money buying this one."
4,Must see movie for people who love the Cape,"For anyone who has been to the Cape, particularly in the off-season, this quaint movie will bring you back. There is a lot of scenery from mid and lower cape areas. The acting is well done and the storyline wraps up the loose ends in the end. Catch Sean Brennan and Dave Hickey playing throughout the Cape during the summer season at O'Shea's Olde Inn on Rt 28 in West Dennis (the Olde Inn in the movie)."
5,Keeps Christmas True,"My husband (at the time boyfriend) went and saw this the Christmas it was in the theaters. Neither of us are Catholic, although my husband did grow up Catholic. Also neither of us knew anything about the film. It was so touching, so thought provoking, and no matter what Christian faith you belong to- this will touch your heart."
4,Touching Christmas Movie,"I watched this for the first time at O'Shea's (very recently in fact). In recent years, it has been a tradition for O'Shea's to play it for some of their patrons. Being a fairly new patron myself, it was fun to see some of the regulars and another friend of mine in the movie!The movie focuses on a small community, and their suffering parish. It is comical, yet it touches on themes that resonate in today's society.Shot right here on Cape Cod (on a shoestring budget it seems), and using local talent, I think this is a fun movie that brings out the Christmas Spirit in both the viewers and the actors on screen."
3,Inconvenient mounting,"The cup holders are mounted right above the emergency brake handle, making it quite inconvenient to put the emergency brake on. With it mounted, you cannot fully engage the emergency brake without hitting the cup holder and if you still have a fully functional (locking) center compartment, it looks like you would have to remove the clip that holds the cover down. Mine was already broken off so there was no need to do it, but it looks like it'd be required if the clip was there."
3,Ehh,It's better than nothing it's not really that sturdy and it won't hold bottles and you gotta shove styrofoam down into it but it does hold cans good.
2,Not for me.,"This cup holder doesn't work very well for my needs. When installed, you can only pull up on the parking brake about 1 or 2 clicks (not really enough to engage it). If you accidentally pull up too much, the screws break through the plastic (washers would probably fix that problem). But also, the holders are not really wide and deep enough to hold much more than a 12oz can. And if the can is full or your cup is taller, expect your drink to fall on your lap, or in my case, the passenger's lap. 2 stars out of 5 because it looks and works as advertised. Just not for me."
1,Restricted Break Lever,Your unable to pull the break lever all the way up. I had read that in a review but I thought I would be able to modify it - now I see that's not possible. This is a bad product.
4,Good Gift for my sonI,"My son very much enjoys the Heeleys. He has gotten pretty good at scooting around. They tend to make me nervous though. After he had them a while I read about all the injuries associated with the shoes. Alot of stores don't allow kids to use them (Denver Zoo, school, library, etc.) so that makes them not quite as fun. I don't allow him to use them on our hard wood floors out of fear of a large scrape on the floor from gravel getting caught in the wheels. Overall, my son has enjoyed them but I am not sure I will replace them when he outgrows them."
4,Powerful Read for Those who Teach Girls,This book is a required text in the Ed.D program at Liberty University. Very interesting read. Easy to understand. Good resources.
4,Answers to an eras problem,"This book does an excellent job of identifying, articulating and fleshing out a problem that is so ingrained in our culture, that few people realize what a problem it is. Often it is only hindsight that offers the insight that this book gives regarding the toxic levels of violence in our society. Hopefully, this book and books like it will offer a new, more sophisticated and enlightened way for humans to solve problems. Because it is all fun and games until someone loses and eye."
2,I was expecting more.,"After reading an article on girl violence in Newsweek, this book was sited as a great resource to further understand this emerging problem in schools.Too bad it didn't live up to the hype. Far to many repeats of already stated information...the book was like reading in circles.By far the most unforgiveable crime was the lack of examples provided. Several introductory pieces were used...all of about 4 or 5. Granted, my main reason for reading this book was to read the sensational horror stories, but the book completely bailed on providing us voyeuristic readers that guilty pleasure! I was also curious about the relationship of violence in regards to feminism and the new ""Sheroes"" of pop culture such as Buffy, The Bride from Kill Bill and other mentions (Alias, Catwoman, etc.) but they were lightly (and I'm talking a few, faint sentences) touched upon."
3,Almost right. . .,"These earrings are so pretty, but they are just a tad too long to sit on my ear correctly. They sit against the rim of cartilage above my earlobe holes and sit crooked. Not sure if I just have small ears or if others have this problem. I wish they were a couple of mm smaller, then they'd be perfect."
1,You'll need 6,Since they last about 3 months before the piezo electric igniter quits snapping properly.
5,Outdoor Lighter,Unfortunately the filament broke off after limited (20 times) use. I would not recommend it.OriginalBest outdoor lighter for the price I have found. I dont have any need for the additional clasp but Im sure it makes the lighter watertight. The wire filament is a little delicate so you have to be careful not to touch it. That seems to be the only difference between this lighter and one that is much more expensive.
5,Great Primer on an Important and Relevant Topic,Professor Berry does an excellent job of introducing a fascinating and complex theory. His synthesis is clear and thought provoking. After reading his book the reader feels like he can discuss the subject intelligently. It also provokes interest in reading the primary texts of several of the most interesting thinkers our world has produced. This book is for anyone interested in philosophy that is extremely pertinent to our modern age. Much of our society's thoughts stem from the writings of the Great Scottish thinkers. Enjoy this book!
5,aFISHianado,"This book is the first Seafood book that makes it easy for me to want to even ty cooking fish at home...the guidance and expertise are superb, the recipes are easy and they work...this book sits on my kitchen counter and is TIMELESS! A must for any real cook"
1,Reads Like A Bad Textbook....Don't Waste Your Money,"This one is a looser...reading it made me feel like eating hard-boiled cork. Brown seems to think that everyone has a restaurant-size kitchen with all the gadgets and tools, and BIG budgets. There are also quite a few errors about seafood. Bad organization also made this book hard to read and very confusing."
1,disappointing and sinister,"I bought this book before I looked at the sample pages of text or illustrations. The rave reviews of ""mystical"" made me expect something more beautiful. I was also hoping for a story of love transforming a cold-hearted creature.I found the illustrations not beautiful but sinister, and too scary for our school's population of age 3 up. Also, the witch never seems to regret her previous pattern of coldly killing innocent sailors, not to ""love"" them below the sea, but just to kill them.The ""love"" between the sailor and the sea witch is very superficial---they ""love"" each other's eyes. To counter a culture which overemphasizes appearances, I look for stories in which people have deeper qualities to love, such as kindness.I feel I wasted my money on this book, which I will not keep in our school collection. If you are trying to teach kindness and compassion, this book is not a good choice."
4,It's time for a party!,"As a young professional who enjoys entertaining & misses all of her friends being together all the time, this is a great book! It is full of creative ways to have a great time without digging deep into your pockets. The book is light hearted and can easily be used by anyone, but cherished by the true sorority girls!"
1,is this the music of a man or a marketing team?,"What upsets me most is that I don't feel like there is a real person behind 'Toby Keith' - he's just a marketing campaign - his whole personality seems so ridiculous and concocted - like he's some moronic hillbilly made up by some record company executives to take advantage of American anger over 9/11 and sell albums to those in the lower IQ brachets. It just seems you'd have to be an ingnorant fool who has no appreciation of music to buy this ""artists"" materials. Thanks."
1,YAWN is it done playing yet?,"Didnt like it at all, nothing new sounding on this latest cd from Toby Keith. His music isnt country enough for me. Its usually the case where an artists gets better with age but Toby seems to have reached a bottom with Shock and Y all."
1,Awful,"A friend of mine recommended it to me. I didn't like it at all. He got the title right. Shocking. The Taliban Song is the one I hate the most. Stupid and ignorant. Hearing the audience cheer when he sings about bombing people is shocking. It is beyond me why they think it is ok to kill people and it is the right thing to do. He claims he 'prays for peace on earth every night'. He can't be serious. The other songs are forgettable. Bland drivel is the only word I can think of to describe this album. I don't mean to bash TK fans who say it is a good album. That is their opinion, but they cannot convince me that this album with idiotic lyrics is a Country album and a good one. This guy is not in the level of Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson or the Dixie chicks. He has a long way to go for this sort of comparison. This album is not for me. Not worth adding to my cd collection. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
5,Love this one!!,"First of all - this is a great cd. Toby Keith just keeps showing he's got what it takes. He is for real! For ali207, hey - have you ever heard of freedom of speech? The problem with people like you is you don't even listen to these cd's. This artist just offends you so you need to continue to be a 6 year old name caller. You must be one angry person. Nobody is pushing their music on America. Toby Keith sells alot of cd's. It's called CAPITALISM. If people didn't like him, he wouldn't be #1! Grow up!!"
1,He's a moron.... a wealthy moron... go figure.....,What a Neanderthal....Geeeeeezh...... Oh well...this is 21st Century America.....
1,Offensive,"I find the title of this album totally offensive. Shock and awe is not something that should be celebrated. People died. Innocent people. Darryl Worley has a song ""Have You Forgotten."" Let's not forget those who died on the other side. They have children too who they love. To capitalize on something so awful is barbaric."
3,This album needs some juice,"Well Toby Keith puts out some good music but this album just lacks some Juice. But also when going to buy an album or cd make sure you know what kind of music you are buying this is in ref to the comment below >>>I don't like this CD, December 26, When I read in Billboard magazine about this dude Toby Keith, I just had to run out and buy his album. But I didn't know that it's a country album. I hate country music. It brings up too many images of redneck trailer park trash. And that's one group of people I'd rather not associate myself with. 2003Well if you checked the Billboard magazine it would tell you and also you would see it under Country music..... NEXT and why do you associate Red necks and trailer trash with country music. thats fine if you dont like country music it's not for everyone"
2,Forced to listen...and it hurt.,"I was forced to listen to this album, before I bought it as a gift for a relative. Please don't tell me that THIS is what we're becoming (or have, God forbid, have already become). Keith so blatantly plays to basest desires, while encouraging his fans to ignore any intelligence or reason. It has a spirit to it, but not a positive spirit, to be sure."
1,Taking advantage of the current US situation!,"I used to be a big Toby Keith fan. Until I started noticing a lot of his songs were about the war and soliders. After a while they all sounded the same and it seemed like he was taking advantage of the current US situation to make more $$$. As a wife of solider, this really turns me off. Other country artists have also gone down this road, but not to the extent that Toby Keith has. Don't support this!!!"
1,Empty pandering fluff,"An awful album from another idiot in a big hat. A simply empty, worthless piece of trash."
3,Tips from a Toby-lover,"I love Toby and his music, but this CD is not as good as the last two. He still sings quite well and puts his heart into it but the lyrics are either boring, non-comprehendable, or a little too raunchy. Overall, it is a decent CD...I would recommend buying it if you love him as much as I do."
1,Nothing but a racist,"Has gotten worse over the years and has now sunk to a new low with this cd. Bush rantings, jesus rantings and anti-muslim thoughts are the new realities of Toby Keith. And it's racist pigs like him that have turned the South into mindless, gay bashing bush supporting idiots."
1,Toby's career soars with BUSH,from '93- 2000--the boy couldn't get a song out.but since he jumped on the Republican band wagon he's a star.
1,"Terrible Music, Terrible Person","I am glad that people are starting to wake up and see what kind of a person Toby Keith is. I am sooo glad he got shut out at the CMA's. He is very arrogant and rude. His songs have no substance. Anyone can write a song about a bar. ""we got boozers"". C'mon, the Dixie Chicks have real talent. This guy has none!!"
1,"Well, shucky-darn and paint me red! The KKK's perfect see-youndtrack!","This is disgusting. Le-yet's all sing about the pleasures of being drunk while writing hick songs about loving y'all's country SO MUCH that you'd be willing to bomb, nay, NUKE the hell out of innocent people simply because they're part of the wrong race.And while we're at it, let's git rid'a them thar hate-mongererin' homo-seeex-shoo-all folks.Puh-RAAAAISSEE Jesus and hee-yis peaceHyuck!"
1,The center point of suck!,"First of all, for him to sing his songs, he has to un-insert his head out of George Bush's ass.Then, he stands up on stage, and sings his crap.With songs called ""If I was Jesus"" and ""The Taliban Song"", this guy should quit his job, and shut the whole country music industry down while he's at it.Ever notice how all most every country song sounds the same??I'll take that as a yes."
1,It's shock'n how bad this album is!,"Folks, I urge you not to waste your money on this one. The songs sound just like the ones from the last album & Mr. Keeth's voice is so flat, it's hilarious. There's not a lick of creativity to be found on this disc. I know Toebee is a ""patriot"" and all that, but that's not what I have a problem with. What I can't stand are these cookie-cutter country albums that rip the country fans off. They all sound the same yet people continue to shell out their hard earned cash for them. I really miss the days when talent was a prerequisite for becoming a country star. YEEHAH!!!"
3,Could be better,"My hubby bought this for me for Christmas (and gave it to me early). I was excited about it, especially since Toby Keith is fast becoming one of my favorite artists. After listening to it, I was disappointed.. It was a novelty. Simply, a novelty. I don't want to buy a political album, I want an album to relax, take me away. A couple of songs were good, and of course ""I Love this Bar"" was wonderful, but the album as a whole wasn't fantastic or memorable, nor did it ""shock"" me at all. I actually found much of it to be obnoxious and immature, perhaps even 'stupid'.Sorry Toby, still Love Ya, but you could have done much better."
1,"Bah i say, BAH!","A'heh, stupid rednecks condeming other races and singing about crap no one cares about, sounds like a money maker to me. I jus.... i ca......iba......errrrrr.....words wont come out, my head is filled with visions of destroying that man. im done, thats it, i cant take it. BAH!"
1,Shock'n All is distasteful,"I don't care for the new Toby Keith CD. Very poor music, very tacky. Looks as if he taking a horrible situation and milking it for all it is worth. I use to be a Toby fan, but after this CD I will never buy another Toby CD again. Guys don't waste your good money on this garbage!"
4,"Thanks, Toby!",You're a great artist and a brave patriot.I'd be all for letting the intelligentsia hold hands with the world as a mean of obtaining peace if my children weren't going to get killed along with them ...Listen up! Some wars are necessary for survival. That is the definition of war!
1,Shlock'n Y'all,"What love for America! What pride in his flag! What disdain for anyone who doesn't fit his narrow-minded agenda. Sub-human racism masquerading as blatant redneck patriotism. Ignorance may be bliss, but is it nirvana? And while the offensiveness of his inherent aesthete is specious enough, his voice brings it all to an even lower standard. And do we really need a 6 minute bar song? Country Music for mongoloids, only one would hope mongoloids would actually revile the stereotyping. My grade: D-"
1,Letdown in VA,This is the worse CD. It showsthe Dixie Chicks were right abouthim being ignorant. Wish I hadread the reviews before I boughtthis CD on release day. The lasttwo were so good but this is a big letdown and waste of money.
2,"If not for ""The Bus Songs""","If not for the two bus songs at the end of this album, it would be completely worthless. There is one good song (I love this bar), and 2 decent bar songs. I like Toby Keith and all, but the rest are pretty bad. If I could do it over again, I would not have bought this cd."
1,All Hat...No Cattle,"Can you say opportunistic? Way to capitalize on the misfortunes of others, Toby."
1,A rip-snotin' good time!!!!,"It's like a modern duelin' banjoes!!!!MAn this home boy really speaks to me. Now I didn't ""finish"" middle school, I'm not a ""smart"" man, I don't know nothin' about music but man Toby really puts it all in perspective for me. He even helps out with putting out the truth about the politic world stuff. Not like them terrist liberal Michael Moore, and Barbra Streisand and other goddamn hippies!!! I mean it was them arabs that attacked us and Toby tells us what to do; put our big, 8-toed foot filled, boots up there ass!!! From the dirty Iraq-cians to just being a real man and a commie punk Toby Keith is right on everything. Me n my cousin spend hours listening to his music, it really puts us in the mood. Buy this album or you hate america"
1,IT SOUNDS BLAND.,"The sound of Tobys new CD is very dull. A lot of so called country artists have adopted the country pop rock blend, which sounds very tired. This CD may sell a lot of product, but years from now this album wont be considered classic."
4,Funny thing happened when reading cd reviews!!!!,"All I'm gonna say is that I thought this was a section devoted to cd reviews not editorials????? Some people should know more before they open their mouths. Toby comes out swinging on this cd; I didn't much care for the ""Bus Songs"" myself but ""Sweet"", ""Ilove This Bar"", ""American Soldier"", ""The Critic"" offer a diversity and bluesier side that to me is reminescent of Hank Williams Jr. I can't think of a better compliment to give the man. If you're a toby Keith fan you won't be disappointed."
2,In partial agreement...,"I agree with most of you, Toby is tops! My favorite artist of any genre. But, more releases like this and I probably won't be buying. Don't get me wrong, I love the guys music, but this collection with only a couple of exceptions, is pretty poor. What happened to his meaningful relationship songs?If you are a Toby fan, you will probably buy this anyway, but be prepared, it's not one of his best, no where near the top. I hope he finds his roots again, If I want this kind of music, I'll buy Alan Jackson stuff."
5,Toby's only getting better,This is one of my favorite CD's from Toby. With each CD he only gets better.
5,Toby Does It Again!!,"Wow! What a brilliant songwriter! And one that can sing to boot, what more could you want? Toby continues to amaze me with his music. You will not be disappointed with this one."
1,Nasty and Malicious!,"Toby's songs kind of take on his personality i.e. malicious and angry! I am not sure why he had such a change in personality. I think after the song ""How Do You Like Me Now?"" he became very bitter for some reason. His music style has changed since then, and I don't like it. His music has no ""heart"" and no feeling. They are just meaningless words set to music. ""we have boozers""??? what is that about? How about some real songs Toby? This is album lacks any substance. Not good!"
1,"Save your money, folks this is garbage","Save your money folks this is more garbage of the oversized ego of Toby's being let loose. The guy sure doesn't have class that's for sure. More of the same macho, commerical, novelity songs from Toby that he has been spitting out for a few years now. Trust me these are not what you call classic country songs that make a impact and will be remember 20 years later. They are throwaway songs that are best forgotten. Toby is crude sometimes in his songs and he defintley needs to get over himself. Save your money its not worth it and with the way radio overplays this overrated artist you will be hearing them anyway."
1,A Disgrace To White Americans,"First it was slave owners and the KKK that gave white america a bad name. Now, you can add to that list present day country music artists. People like Toby Keith singing stupid ""Patriotic"" anthems and talking about drinking beer, shopping at Tractor Supply, watching NASCAR, and women leaving them. Music like this just reinforces negative white stereotypes to the rest of the world. People like Toby Keith have never served in the Armed Forces themselves, yet they enjoy talking like they are really doing something in this current war in Iraq, all the while kissing the buttocks of George W Bush. I myself live in the country and I want nothing to do with any of the stereotypical activities that Toby Keith and others talk about in their ""music"". I would suggest that people who listen to this should explore other genres of music, or just stay with classic country."
1,very disapointing,Great music! However I usually listen to my CD's while working at my computer. This CD will not play using my computer and therefore it is useless and being returned in the morning.
1,Anti-American,"Toby sings about everything American DOESN'T stand for. Don't buy this hateful stuff. Toby, you should be ashamed. You are everything BUT patriotic."
5,A Great American,"It was simply a pleasure to meet Toby Keith today while he was in town for a political fundraiser. He met my youngest daughter who is 6 years old. He told security to bring her backstage. He had the time of his life with her, playing and swinging her around. She had no clue who he was other than he is her daddy's favorite country performer. Him and I are both local mobile djs and he is presently serving his country proudly. Whenever he did gigs he played Toby Keith songs hourly. It was really nice of Toby to sign an autograph for her. She did it for her daddy. She is very very proud of her daddy and of Toby for what they have done for our country. I was very honored to have met him backstage also and appreciate what he has done for our troops. Thanks again Toby and I hope that the Oklahoma Music Hall Of Fame here in Muskogee inducts you and Reba McEntire in VERY soon!"
2,The Songs Are Pretty Forgettable,"I received this CD as a Christmas gift and I'm not impressed with it. There's really nothing catchy about the songs (the exception being ""I Love This Bar""). This album is primarily filler material. I find that whenever artists release albums fairly quickly, as was the case with this CD, they don't seem to have much to offer. Perhaps Toby Keith should have allowed himself MUCH more time to write a CD with substance after the release of ""Unleashed"". I'm pretty disappointed with the album, and pretty angry that ~$15.00 was wasted on it.As an aside, I find it pretty pathetic that artists are using the 9/11 attacks as a way to make their albums sell. These artists don't need to rehash it on their CDs."
3,Limited Interest,"This is basically a good CD of country music, and manyfans of the artist will enjoy the songs.However, it turns out that several of the best songs arevirtually ruined, for many listeners, because they wererecorded ""live,"" and the whistles, yells and screams sodetract from the music, we have to wonder if they were leftin on purpose, for some reason music-lovers will fail tounderstand, or if they result from the inattention ofsome sound engineers.The extra noise--and that is all it is--overpower the musicin several songs, and that really detracts from enjoymentof this CD.Amazingly, the CD isn't labeled ""live"" anywhere on the CD.As a matter of fact, some of the songs are played on radiostations without the distracting and loud background noise,so someone understands how bad the CD we buy is.Largely, a disappointment."
2,"Better than ""Unleashed"" but that doesn't take much","Keith is still sunk in testosterone overload in this album, but returns to his true country roots with tunes such as ""Whiskey Girl."" One hopes he will leave politics and return to entertainment. His first album is still his best."
2,Not the Toby I Love,"As a huge Toby fan, I couldn't wait to get to the store to buy ""Shock'n Y'All."" Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in this CD. It seems as though was thrown together for the sake of putting out a new CD. It doesn't even come close to the quality of ""How Do You Like Me Now"" or ""Unleashed."" The lyrics are bad, and his beautiful voice has never so out of tune. Don't waste your money on this bomb!"
1,Racism and bigotry does not a good record make.,"Having sat through this record, I can say with authority that this is thinly veiled racism that people allow themselves to be comfortable with. I am a former soldier, and a current consciencious objector. People like Toby Keith are the reason why so many young men die. Those who embrace their country, right or wrong, are doing a disservice to themselves and their children, as well as neglecting their duty as thinking citizens.So buy this record if you voted for Bush, slap a ""Get them Ragheads"" sticker on your vehicle, and spend your tax relief check on mallomars and Judge Judy Boxed Sets. The other 50% of this country will be able to identify you and leave you the hell alone. You're too dangerous to be around anyway."
2,Great singer and performer...mediocre album,"I love Toby Keith, but this CD feels like a rushed-up attempt at cashing in on his rising commercial success. ""American Soldier"" is a moving and effective song, and is definitely the best thing going here. ""I Love This Bar"" is not overly original, but does sort of worm it's way into the listener's consciousness after awhile...in a good way, I think. But...""Whiskey Girl"" is embarrassingly bad and hokey. The pretentiousness of the title of ""If I Was Jesus"" is a pretty good indicator of that tune. ""Nights I Can't Remember"" is not bad...but ""Critic,"" ""Taliban,"" and ""Weed"" are. Because Toby is Toby and I can't help but like him, I'll add a star to this one, which brings it up to a grand total of...2 stars. Sorry, Toby, but maybe if you dropped the cliches and took a couple of steps sloooowly backward, you'd be a little better off next time."
5,Shock'n Y'all,Consider me crazy but I purchased a second copy of this CD as a backup because I wanted to be sure I had another copy if I wore out the first. It's one of Toby's best....very upbeat!!!!!
1,Don't waste your money.,This is not the norm for him. I'm very disappointed on this one. He just sounds too stressed out and he shouldn't be spittin' these albums out like this.
1,jingo-istic ditties for rednecks and tattooed mongoloids,"No music here. Just political chants -- fed by simple-minded arrogant politics. I don't get how these war-mongers claim they follow Jesus, the Prince of Peace, while all the time wanting to kill people.If you want to buy some real country music, may I recommend the album ""I'm Always On A Mountain When I Fall"" by Merle Haggard? That's full of beautiful songs by someone who can really sing.But if you want some music that sings about loving America (not America's government) buy just about anything by Bruce Springsteen -- like ""Born In The USA."" There's a singer with a conscience."
1,Ignorance,"I know it's stupid to judge the artist and not the music, but Toby Keith needs to grow up. I agree with the Dixie Chick's Natalie Maines on this one. His over-patriotism and lack of respect for the rest of the world is depressing."
1,Toby -- OH NO! How can it be so bad?,"I Love Toby. Got this CD for Christmas. I hope this is not a preview of where Toby is going. I'm also glad it isn't the first CD of his I've owned, or I'd probably never buy another. What a disappointment after the previous ones."
3,Mediocre,"I felt that the Shock'n Y'all was quite lackluster in its composition. A few of the songs were good, but for the most part it failed to live up to his earlier works."
1,Loved Unleashed...,"""I Love This Bar"" is the best song on the album and it isn't even that great of a song (If anyone else sang the song nobody would care about it). Let me say that I AM A TOBY KIETH FAN. However, as big of a fan as I am I had to force myself to listen to the whole thing. After I listened to it I took it out of the CD player and never listened to it again. Don't waste your money folks. The last CD was awesome from start to finish. Shock'n Y'all shocked me because it was so horrible. If you love country music I reccomend that you check out Hank Williams Jr's new CD ""I'm One Of You."" The first song is the only one I didn't care for and the rest were awesome! This should be the Album Of The Year for next year!"
1,Very disappointed,"I was first in line to buy two of his new cd - one for my husband and one for myself. On the way home I eagerly put the cd in and tomorrow I'm taking one copy back. It's not worth it. There are just two songs on there that are really good - I love this bar and American Soldier, but the rest I thought were not good at all - in fact some were irritating to listen to - not because of content but the way they were sung. I am very disappointed. My husband can testify that I am one of Toby's biggest fans and his other cds have been great - this one -- skip it. Given a little more time they should come out with another Toby Keith's greatest hits and I Love This Bar and American Soldier should be on it - buy then."
2,Not Shocked -- disappointed,"Pros: Toby's voice, the music was okay, two or three of the cutsCons: The other eight or nine cutsI was looking forward to this CD. When I first started listening to Toby Keith, my reaction was the same as Amy Grant's (when she handed him the award and commented on the fact that she thought he had issues with women), then I grew to enjoy nearly everything he'd done. Until now. As I said, I was looking forward this release and went out at 7:30 am to grab it -- now I wish I hadn't. American Soldier is a nice tribute piece, I Love This Bar is a good-time piece with a nice feel to it, and Nights I Can't Remember, Friends I'll Never Forget was another one that I liked, as for the rest?..... Well, it's a good thing he's got the Baddest Boots in town because the rest of this CD wouldn't get him a second look. I'm not Shocked, Toby, I'm really disappointed."
3,"It's not his usual, but hey...","Now get it in your head first, I LOVE TOBY ! So, even if some things are not his greatest, I'll still love 'em & defend 'em. There's a few fun, fresh, great tracks on here. I think someone who hasnt loved him since Boomtown, maybe a newcomer, would really love this cd. Great driving songs, party songs, buddy songs, bar songs. I think there alot of references to the military & patriotism as this is really aimed to all those great people serving our nation & fighting for freedom. I betcha this picks up their spirits like an apple pie & cheesburger .BUT--BUT--I miss Toby's deep soulfull sultry love songs, maybe a ballad. Not too many ballads, but maybe one. DONT BE PUT OFF by this -- Weed with Willie, I Love this Bar, Taliban Song, If I were Jesus, they are worth buying this- who cant love those songs ?? But if ya want ""Blue Moon"" ""Dreamwalking"" --just aint here. Oh- the bonus video for cd rom-- LOVE IT LOVE IT !!"
4,An outside opinion...,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a rock n roll man. I'm very ecclectic and I love almost all rock. I hate country music. New country music, that is. Don't get me wrong. I love Waylon, Willie, Johnny Cash, and Hank Williams Sr. Old country and bluegrass are wonderful. New country is normally washed out schlock. Toby Keith is a glaring exception. He's bold, funny, and an All-American country boy just like me. Not to mention he has a hell of a voice. ""I love this bar"" is a true to life, fun song. And ""If I was Jesus"" speaks volumes. The ""bus"" songs at the end of the set are awesome as well. And I have to hand it to the man. ""American Soldier"" is going to be one sure fire morale booster for our boys overseas. That being said, there are some songs on this album that sound like generic new country. Hence only 4 stars. But this is a great album and if you've never given a thought to country music, take a timeout and meet Toby Keith."
1,The musical embodiment of the Patriot Act,"This past weekend I was in a car and was forced to listen to The Taliban Song over and over. It is the most racist song I have ever heard. Probably it is the most racist song in the history of humans.Hearing people cheer when he sings about bombing civilians is absolutely disgusting. To characterize the HUMAN BEINGS of Afghanistan as cave-dwelling camel herders is sick. And then he brings religion into it, suggesting that people deserve to die because they are Muslim.If I were the head of a terrorist network I would translate this song and use it to incite more terror. This is the reason why people in other countries hate us."
1,Wake up....READ or just disagree automatically,"I'll admit it. 'How do you like me now?' was a catchy song. It was fun, even the video was entertaining. Now 'Shock'n Y'all' comes along and delves deep into tastelessness. The title, which uses slangs and abbreviations to show how country he is, is a military term in which people were bombed and killed.I've read reviews saying he's a good ol' boy speaking his mind and doesn't care that he's not politically correct. It's capitalizing on current trends. A majority of the songs have no substance and often ring of unintelligence.The spectrum of Toby's songs seem to be that of hatred and sappiness, the latter being country music's staple. Don't support this, don't spend money on this manufactured garbage. Think. Wake..."
1,Can we perhaps deport Toby Keith to Saudi Arabia?,"Toby Keith and Jessica Simpson, and all that other teeny bopper/boyband/country crap is exactly what is wrong with American music today. Its not so much music as phony, flag-waving idiocy that passes itself as music just to make a quick buck. Johnny Cash is rolling in his grave as phony jingoist garbage like Toby Keith and others of these ""new country"" artists hijack what used to be a great music genre."
1,by the Numbers&Lame,"""I Love this Bar"" is a trip&that is all I can tolerate from this Album.Vocally Toby Keith is decent but the Music&overall direction here is not working.it seems like He is trying to live up to a certain Image of being Precieved as the OutLaw RedNeck or something&the Novelty wears pretty thing really fast.the songs feel more like Skits than anything else overall.He has always been one of those type of artists that is alright in spots but not alot of substance for a whole set but this Album even questions that logic."
1,It sucks,"I have never heard most of these songs and don't intend to. From what i have heard, i can say with confidence that this album blows. thank you."
1,yuck,"It is very rare that I do not finish a book I start - I tend to feel compelled to plow on through. However, in this case, I just could not. I thought this book was a total bore and I did not care about the characters at all. Don't buy it."
4,There's something here,"There's something very American about this novel. A lot of people probably thought there wasn't much to it, but really when you look at the daily ordinary occurances and tragedies of our lives, they don't always seem so profound. It's when you view them as a sum of their parts that you see the meaning. I've never read a book that painted a life, several lives, so vividly and realistically. I believe in Ann and Adele. The ending is perfect. Adele loved Ann the best that she could, and it was a reckless, selfish, hurtful love, but it was love. Call me crazy but there's something sort of beautiful about that."
5,I LOVED this book. POIGNANT,"Beautifully written, great character descriptions and moving. I really loved this book -- it's a true GEM. I will look to buy Mona Simplson's other books."
5,"Outstanding Novel, Enjoyable/Enlightening for Every Reader","I have read and enjoyed this novel more than four times. Each time I appreciated it more and found some other thing to savor. Contrary to what others have said, I feel strongly that everyone, male or female, can enjoy and LOVE this book. Although the main characters are female, it would be foolish to deny yourself an outstanding reading experience because you might foolishly consider this a ""women's novel"". Read...and enjoy..."
2,eh....,"I didn't understand why this book would've struck so many people as moving. First of all, Ann's character - it didn't seem like she grew up at all. When she got to 17, I was struck by the fact that I was still thinking she was YOUNG - like, under 10. And, where were Ann's emotions? A lot of the things YOU could imagine how they would've hurt, but I never felt like ANN was all that connected. Adele was very believable, and Carol and Ann's grandmother were also good. But Ann herself just seemed like a very cardboard person. Also, I agree that the explicit stuff didn't seem to have any basis in the story half the time. The jumping around sometimes disturbed the plotline and was annoying."
1,Brevity is the soul of wit.,"This book might have been a good book at 150-180 pages. The book needs severe editing; perhaps that would give some direction to the meanderings of Ms. Simpson. I actually cannot figure out why this was a bestseller. However, I can see the possibility of a decent movie from it because a director can reshape the novel as she/he sees fit. As a novel, though, I cannot recommend it. I recommend Graham Greene's The End of the Affair for a beautifully made and well-modulated novel. Enjoy!"
2,Boring,"Oh, puh-leese! Far from being a beautiful, moving book as other critics on this page have stated, this is just another long, boring book about another boring dysfunctional family. There isn't one likable character -- I'll admit to some admiration for the teenager who holds her own against her whacko mother, but she still isn't likable or even realistic. Even the ""normal"" relatives in Wisconsin are pretty flat. In a book where there is basically no plot, there really OUGHT to be some memorable characters. The writing was okay (which is why I gave it two stars), but overall it was a waste of time."
3,Kind of wishing I was anywhere but there,"In Mona Simpson's ""Anywhere But Here"", she shows a young girl's life as she grows up with her self-obsessed mother. Simpson fills the book with many short stories that have almost no connection to the rest of the book. The first few pages are a hard read because of the many characters to connect and the many metaphors, similes, and long description paragraphs.Simpson doesn't give enough description of Ann or her her mother, Adele, to get a clear picture of ages, looks, or motives. Although the book is an interesting look at a mother and daughter's roller-coaster ride of a relationship, it is not a book that I would recommend investing in."
1,ugh...,"I absolutely hated this book, it made me sick. Normally I can handle and usually like disturbing books but this one really rubbed me the wrong way. Adele the mother is...infuriating, and completely unpleasant to read about. I got so sick of hearing about all the red meat they ate, especially the chateaubriand! Like many other reviewers, I thought it could have been edited into a much shorter book. I actually liked the movie, I thought they culled the best parts from the book and made a cohesive story. If you want to read something good by Simpson, find her story called Lawns. It is devastatingly good."
3,Pretty good,"I enjoyed reading this book, for the most part. The characters are very unusual, not predictable and stereotypical, and the story is okay. ""Anywhere but Here""'s major strength is not in its plot, but in the character development and insight into the life of this family. Sometimes, I really just wanted something to HAPPEN--there were parts I felt like skipping because they seemed pointless. The book is also very, very different from the movie (which I saw before reading the book), both in the plot and the message it sends.Don't buy this book if you're looking for suspense. Don't buy it if you want an uplifting and life-affirming story. Do buy it if you would like to read a sort of ""biography"" of a fascinating family and how they came to be the people they were."
3,"Great start, terrible finish","I decided to read the book because I saw it was being made into a movie. The beginning was very good, and found the reading enjoyable, but the charachters lacked any real substance. The charachter of Ann as a young girl is very likeable, especially in light of her mother and father situation. But over the course of the book you lose any real feeling for her as well. The mother is a great charachter, but you feel no compassion at all for her."
3,just ok,"I read this book a month ago when I heard about the movie. I didn't think it was that good because it repeated itself too much. Every chapter would be told by a different character and one would tell a story and then in the next chapter another character would tell the same story and it wouldn't be very differnt. I would read it before seeing the movie though because I thought the movie left out a lot of things that were funny in the book. I thought the book was better than the movie though, but neither was a complete waste of time. Read it if you want to, but not a must."
1,terrible,I thought this book was awful. It writes about molestation and other dysfunctions for no real purpose. I put it in the incinerator. (I have been reading since I was three and I am hard put to find a book that I don't like.)
2,Disturbing characters,"If you enjoy spending time with a narcissistic monster, you'll love this book! Adele is a real creep, and Ann isn't much better. I was also disturbed that I couldn't get a fix on how Mona Simpson ""sees"" her characters. Are we supposed to admire Adele? Be respulsed by her? Feel sorry for her? I'm interested in seeing the movie to see if and how Susan Sarandon makes Adele an appealing character. Overall, I found the book to be interesting but not satisfying."
1,Anybook but this one..,"Grade: C-. I found this book; shallow, predictable and petulant. If you are into the mindless, repetitive episodes of 90210 than you would enjoy this book. I'm not, so I didn't. I thought the 'theme' (mother and daughter brave it alone and struggle for riches)was overplayed and overdone, I was not inspired to closeness with a single character of this book. This book lives up to all the stereotypes of a woman's gold-digging empiness and is so much what so many struggle not to be viewed as. It almost made me think the novel was written by a man making fun of the inferior gender.At the end of this long and boring read, I was at least expecting the heroine to develop above the petty and supericial character of her mother; dispairingly, she never did. This might be a good book to read if you just need the soothing aprodisiac of mind candy, but overall I would not reccomend it; I'd rather watch 90210."
2,"Silly, superficial","This book is high-up on a lot of booklists, but I wasn't impressed. The mother and daughter have few redeeming qualities, and there is nothing moving or impressive about the writing itself. I want Picasso, not Norman Rockwell!"
1,UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"I read about 4 books a week, this book took me 3 weeks. I forced myself to finish it, I kept thinking something anything would HAPPEN! I agree with another review I read, ""this book should have be edited to a 1/3 of it's content. When I finally finished it I immediately went and rented the movie, I kept thinking if the book was based on the movie (which was just OK) that it would have been 1/4 of it's size. I did enjoy some moments of the book but definately not worth all that reading hoping it would ""get to the point""..."
4,Cinnabar wears well!,"I do notice some slight cutting marks on the cinnabar plates, but one has to look VERY closely to see them! This is my first experience with fiestaware and I LOVE the product - they seem to be very durable and long lasting; my family is TUFF on dinnerware! I look forward to collecting more of the cinnebar collection! For every day dinner ware - this is good stuff!"
2,SGreview,"I found this book to be very disappointing. I felt like I was reading a college term paper. The pictures look like they are very low quality and printed off a personal printer. It has font that is very large, I suspect to make it have more pages. The information was decent, just not what I expected. The author seemed to just quote from ""O"" magazine and talk shows, so it seemed like the book did not have much depth to it. It was not worth the price."
2,Don't ask any questions!,"After reading some of the author's material I contacted him with a question. His reply was very unprofessional and he further posted it to an e-mail list serve among a number of other questions he received in which he puts down the individuals asking the questions, using such terms as ""stupid"" and ""lacking in common sense"". This attitude calls into question his integrity as a trainer and coach, and the objectivity of the material in the book."
5,Familiar the crime fighting kitty goes hollywood....,"in this installment in Caroline Burnes ""Fear Familiar"" series Familiar, the private eye black cat is a stunt double for the star kitty. The hero and heroine of this story are stuntpeople as well. The heroine is accused of jewelry theft, and it's up to Familiar and cowboy hunky stuntman Jax to get her out of trouble.A fast fun read, more a suspense than a romance but still quite enjoyable. 4.5 stars!"
4,oh descartes,"well..descartes is kind of long winded.he's trying to prove we can KNOW things about the natural world, which he does. fantastic.the problem now is by decartes standard can there be agnostic or atheist scientists?"
4,This book was very information-packed and very well-done.,"I am a fifth-grader who is reading this book for a book report on the Rebecca Caudell Awards book list. This book is very informational about the Holocaust and tells things in a very detailled way, not a broad way as in some books. The book told what happened at the camps and what happened in the ghettos. I think that the book was very well done and the chronology and the glossary were both done very well. The stories of the people who suffered really made an impact on me. Most of the stories were very short but some of them were long and I think that they were important."
5,An inncredible book,"To start of this is an very inncredible book. It is ashamed it had to happen, but that is how life is. The book explains great detail of the Holocaust. When I first read this book I wanted to cry it is so emotional. If I had the chance to go back in time I would run away for all of this hatred.I really enjoyed this book, and I really like how Susan wrote it. Next time I will by another good book from her."
2,not as pictured,"this hat is not as pictured. since SU changed their logo to the block 'S' I have hated it and was excited to think this hat would have the old logo, it doesn't.all around it's probably still a good hat, quality wise."
5,Awesome!!,"It was always a dream of mine to replace all of our boring dishware with Fiestaware, and last year, we did. This was one item I purchased for the set and it, along with the whole Fiestaware line, is extremely durable. I drop things, I slam things into counters, I am pretty clumsy. These things do NOT chip or break, even when they knock against each other in the dishwasher.Plus they are beautiful. I love the blue color. I don't put them in my cupboards, they are proudly displayed :)"
3,Great bowls... smaller than I expected,"I purchased these bowls as a gift for my mother-in-law. I love the color and the quality of the bowls, I was a little disappointed with the size. Much smaller than I imagined them to be. It's my fault... the seller gave the measurements."
4,Excellent for preschoolers.,Great way to introduce or reinforce the true story of Easter without frightening small children.
3,"I'm with ""disappointed""","The story is very lengthy - way too much text for the age group of 4-8 that it was recommended for. The child in the story asks some great questions and the answers are quite detailed and interesting but more appropriate for older children. In terms of classroom use (which was what I was looking for) I don't think I'd use it with anyone younger than 3rd grade. As beautiful as the illustrations are, I wish Jesus had more of a middle-eastern look."
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this product in Sept. 2008 for 18.79, now look at the price of 49.50. I contacted Amazon about this price several times and got the run around. Google this product and you can buy this from multiple places and get free shipping, plus get it for 18.99."
1,"WONDERFUL PRODUCT, RIDICULOUSLY HIGH PRICED","What obviously should have been listed as a three-pack of 36 pads each for $49.50 is a priced (AND SHIPPED) single pack of 36 pads. If this is, as Amazon claims, a change in supplier that has resulted in this HUGE increase, then Amazon NEEDS TO FIND ANOTHER SUPPLIER. Telling their customers that this is a legitimate product price increase just shows that Amazon.com is not paying attention to their customers AND their products. I hope someone at Amazon.com is looking at these recent reviews, since they don't seem to be taking their e-mails seriously about this ludicrous price increase! For people who need this product for medical problems, many of whom are on fixed incomes, these pads can still be found elsewhere for between $17 and $19 for a package of 36 pads."
1,"Great product, exorbitant price","I had this on auto ship for a loved one who is ill, at a price of $15.12. Out of the blue, Amazon raised the price without prior notification to the current $42.08 auto ship price. This item is available at most online drugstores in the same size for a maximum price of $18.99. I have canceled the auto ship and have returned this last shipment. This has to be an error on Amazon's part, but the best the very polite customer service representatives could do was issue me a return label, I was told upon receipt my last charge would be refunded. Very disappointed in Amazon for having raised the price like this on an auto ship. I have discontinued several auto ships I had with Amazon, as I fear this may be a new policy with them, and I have no desire to have to be returning things all the time. Pity. It is a fine product but get it elsewhere."
2,Fluke? I sure hope so.,"Fist let me say that I have used Tena for a long time. I have usually been very satisfied with it.The last two purchases were not that great. In the first one, 2 of the pads were not usable as they split as soon as you took the tape off.On the next package, there were 6 of the same thing. I am hoping that this is not a regular thing as these pads are expensive and should be intact.Hopefully this will be fixed soon and I can upgrade this review because I really like this product."
1,Too expensive,"I cannot believe these prices. That's a rip! I pay $5.47 for one package of 36-count (at Walmart), and it is the very same thing."
5,Very Absorbent,These pads are very absorbent. Mother had a sore spot that just wouldn't go away but when we changed her to these pads it was healed in about three weeks.
3,Frequent Customer,I usually order these every few weeks. Each time I order I am charged a different price for the exact same item.
5,A Great Help for An Embarassing Problem,"I have tried quite a few Tena Products and the Ultimate Pads are by far the best solution for me even at night as these really limit leakage and hold a lot. I also use these when out and about and changing pads is difficult and I feel so much more secure even when out for a long time. Before I was afraid of long outings as I did't want to have an ""accident"". I am really happy that with the Amazon subscription service the price is very reasonable and the home shipping eliminates the embarassment of buying at the store. Thanks Tena and Amazon."
2,Why is this product so expensive????,"I have been purchasing this product and it is perfect for my needs. But all of a sudden the price was jacked up from $18 to $46+. I am a senior lady on a fixed income and cannot afford to pay $1.50 per pad - this is ridiculous. I told Amazon to cancel, got a confirmation of the cancellation, then the next day got a confirmation that the order was shipped. So, I have to refuse it when it comes as I won't pay that much for the product. Back to checking the local brick and mortar stores. Too bad as I liked the subscription delivery, but don't want to be gouged."
5,COMFORT & SECURITY,"I have tried many products but the Tena Serenity Padshave been the best. When I leave my home I feel secureknowing that I don't have to worry about leakage or ifit holds enough in case of and accident. I have beenembarrassed so many times with the other products I have used.I have been using these pads for three years.Comfort and security equals serenity in this caseTena Serenity Pads, Ultimate."
4,"Good product, but they are LONG","Bought these on subscription for my mother -- the auto-delivery is great. The price is good, too. The only thing that is bothersome is that Tena keeps changing the configuration of the pads. I thought these were the regular length heavy duty ones, but apparently they are long. As in VERY long. Just wish they'd make it a little clearer on the description."
4,"Tena, Serenity","I love Serenities, I think they are the best,I have used them for quite a long time. I am so happy that I could buy them from Amazon."
1,Cheaper in stores,"Cancelled my subscribe and save subscription, 'cause with the multiple price increases, it's cheaper in stores. Too bad, because it was quite convenient. Pads are great, just not at the price they're charging. I feel like a victim of ""bait and switch"" tactics."
4,maur,I have found this item to be less absorbing than a product at Remke/Bigg's grocery store which I have purchase and found to be better.Therefor I am cancelling all future orders of the Tena PadsMaureen Armstrong
3,Sometimes bulky,"The pads stick with just the right amount of adhesive, but sometimes the pads get bulky and bunch up too much."
3,Works okay,"The jar will fit, but you must screw it in exactly right or it will leak. You must take the time to fit it perfectly correct. My original jar wasn't like that. It works well enough since I was lucky to find this brand replacement part. I love this blender since the jar is oversized and has great horsepower."
4,Xti DVD,"Great DVD. Very detailed in all of the available features of this camera. It was very easy to follow and had a great deal of information for the new SLR user such as myself. The only thing complaint that I have is that the video was created before the Xti model was released, so the video shows the features of the Xt instead of the Xti model. However, you can find the same features that coorespond to the Xti model very easily. The display on the Xti model is much better and easy to read then the Xt model."
1,"too much wind,not enough value of content.","too much talk, not enough useful information. would notbuy from this company again. very poor presentation and useful presentation."
1,Very small,"These earrings were very tiny. They look more like squiggles than feathers. Also, the post is quite short, and the back wasn't tight enough to hold it onto my ear."
3,Pretty,"These are pretty little earrings, but i was disappointed that the stud part was in a different place on both of them, so they hang to different lengths. Doesn't stop me from wearing them in my second pierce from time to time."
3,LES DEMOISELLES,"This was a wonderful recording! Beautifully sung and balanced, crystal clear clarity. Donizetti would be proud."
3,"great art, bad printing","I consider this to be Wrightson's swan song... his last awesome work. The price is excellent for so many pages of amazing work, and I appreciate that they didn't mess up the artwork with color.But the printing is awful, and so much of the beauty of his line work is mashed and fuzzy. Just too bad. I'll have to dig up my old heavy metal magazines to see just how awesome it is."
3,Nice,"Good story and great art, but the printing quality isn't as high as you'd want it to be. Great for Wrightson fans though."
2,Not in same league as other series books...,This book has a fraction of enjoyment as compared to the earlier books in the series. The number of object to engage are decimated.
5,Sharing the heart of a people,"The heart of the people of Crow country is expressed in concise and vivid terms through each chapter of FROM THE HEART OF THE CROW COUNTRY : The Crow Indians' own story.Every page is practical and plainly relates a specific aspect of Crow/Absorokee life. The history, modern experience, and hope of a proud people can begin to be understood through this volume."
5,Wonderful,"This book is truly fabtastic, a recommended read to anyone. Just pick open the pages and read, nothing complicated with it as it is written extremely well.Enjoy."
4,queasy listening?,"a piledriver of a record that has not lost very much power (or vitriol) 15 years after its release.the frenzied ""thieves."" the sweltering and ominous ""cannibal song."" al's guttural roars on ""breathe."" chris connelly's barely restrained disenfranchised-youth pronouncements on ""so what."" two legitimately creepy outro songs. this is as important a recording to the genre now as it was then.naturally, there are many bands today in many genres who play faster, louder, and heavier, but all of them owe no small debt to al, paul and company.about the only negative on here is the rather clumsy ""test""--which, despite its life-affirming lyrics, seems a half-baked attempt at rap-thrash. but heck, if that's the only complaint i have, what else is there to say?for best results, explore this one in tandem with ""the land of rape and honey."""
4,I found it to be a melange of musical melodies.,The cd combined many interesting musical elements and sounds. It starts off well with Thieves only to end wonderfully with the imaginative and ever riveting Dream Song. I recommend this album because it has so much to offer.
4,RIGHT ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Cannibal SOng has to be one of the creepiest songs I ever heard. The fact is that whenever I listen to that song I get flash-backs of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. All I think about when listening to that song is that movie. Its a really kick ass album and hear thieves cause thats a wicked song too.
4,the waste is a terrible mind to thing...yeah,"ok, if you would have asked me what i thought about this album 3 months ago, i'd say its the most overrated piece of crap cd ever made, with no effort whatsoever, hows that for honesty?? but, i gave this bad boy some listening, and some paitence, and wow, i love it. classic in my book. and yeah, it may be repetitive, but it is that kind of trancy repetitiveness, you know, after hearing it, it gets to you, and it effects you, but not in a bad way, and if music effects you, then there is a good thing. this is definetly an album written under the influence, and it shows. its got good drumbeats, and good guitair pieces. i really like the bass on here too. check this out with an open mind, and dont let the repetitiveness effect you too much, it gets better...peace"
4,Has great songs...,"But has some songs that arent so great. It has 3 just really good ones(""So What"" is my fav. Ministry song), like ""So What"", ""Theives"", and ""Burning Inside."" It also has some okay ones, ""Breathe"", ""Never Belive"", and ""Dream Song."" However, it does have some songs that I'd really not rather listen to, like ""Cannibal Song"", ""test"", and ""Faith Collapsing."" So, there are some REALLY good upsides to this album, but some bad downsides. However, i recommend this to any Ministry fan(if they dont have it already)."
4,One song says it all,"Dream Song. The single most incredible dark industrial ambient song ever created. And I should know, I listen to nothing but industrial and dark ambient. If you're into those kinds of genres, you will want to buy this CD for that track alone. It is spell-binding. Like being dragged through the Abyss while surrounded by a chorus of fallen angels, and then looking into the face of Vishnu.The rest of the CD is enjoyable...if you're into music that beats your body into submission. I go for small doses, but always come back for Dream Song..."
5,BUY THIS ALBUM NOW,"Industrial reaches a peak with Ministry's A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste. This is a beautiful piece of monster machinery. ""Thieves"" crunches and pounds and ""Burning Inside"" is raw anger and power. The album continues like this. High points are the thunderous ""Cannibal Song"" and the mysterious and eerie ""Dream Song"". Pure goodness . . . buy it now, or never know its greatness."
5,Whoa,"Karelia Visa was the first Hedningarna Cd I ever bought and is still one of my favorites. Great music, Hedningarna has a great ability to make everything they do sound so different the other stuff thats out their."
1,Gave it a shot,"Even though this author's other 2 books got not-so-good reviews, I gave this one a shot. I'm sorry to say it wasn't very good."
4,Old favorite,I like to mix this coffee with the French Roast for tasty coffee in the moring or later in the day with a special dessert. The automatic shipping schedule works well for me.
1,Nasty!,"Mine must have come from a different lot than the other reviewers. This is just plain nasty. When you open the bag you are indeed aware of a smoky flavor, but a burned smoky flavor. When I ground the beans, I was assaulted by the smell of a recently burned out building put out with water, with the added bonus of burned animal carcasses inside.It tastes worse than it smells, from what I could tell of the few sips I dared to take.After that first pressing, the remainder of the bag went into the trash."
4,Another Good Roast from Cafe Altura,"I haven't bought a coffee from Cafe Altura that disappointed me. This is a great French roast; I have no complaints about the coffee, but I will say some of their roasts are better than this one. Its brews great coffee; its just not their best roast."
2,Oily Coffee Beans,"We were terribly disappointed with the oily coffee bean. The coffee beans were difficult to grind and required a good deal of attention. Even when I managed an ample supply of ground coffee, the coffee was without body"
3,Japanese 101,"The dvd is great for beginners who want to review the Japanese language , and refresh your memory on the language. It been sometime I have taken Japanese and I found it helpful."
3,Japanese 101,Product came prompted but didn't receive a phrasebook as stated on the dvd. Which was kind of a bummer.
1,He needs to be serious,"If wyclef continues with such nonsense,i'll stop possessing his albums.What is he? a rapper,reggae singer or what? You are agood lyricist clef,but you need to decide what you want to do"
2,not rap,"In the first track steve harvey calls wyclef jean a master in hip hop. Most of the album was not rap. With the exception of industry they were mostly slow songs without good beats. Carnival was a great album with freat tunes and ecleftic was alright, but masquerade wasn't great and this I think was worse. I am a fan of wyclef's rap not his slow r&b reggae stuff. I am very sorry i bought the cd."
2,Disappointment,This cd is so disappointing--it's basically R&B and not even good R&B! The only song I like is the baby momma song.
1,wyclef blows,"This dude is always trying to mix different types a music together and it sucks. I hate is music. He thinks he can sing and he can't. He thinks he can guitar and he can't, if you play then you know what I'm talking about. Wyclef really sucks. He style is so whack. I think he is confused, is he hatian or jamaican. His songs get me confused. Wyclef should have all of his fingers cut off and his tongue removed to stop his pace-maker stopping music."
4,Almost a masterpiece...,"If you're expecting a cd with Wyclef's signature socially conscious, heavy hitting rhymes, then don't buy this one. Clef only rhymes on a couple tracks -- the rest of The Preacher's Son showcases his skills as an musical artist, as he gives us layers upon layers of vocals mixed with creative beats and melodies. You'll hear reggae and Latin influences, and a few tracks that pay homage to motown and fifties soul. You'll randomly hum songs like ""Take Me as I Am."" You'll feel his raw emotions in ""Grateful"" and ""Industry."" I wanted to give this one 5 stars, but I kinda wish he would have included a couple more songs with his brilliant rhymes (see: the Carnival). Here's some advice: listen to The Preacher's Son at least twice before you make up your mind. Open your ears, crank this cd up high...and you'll be listening to one of the best of the year."
5,Wyclef Jean brings what he didnt bring in Masquerade,"YOYOYO, ok, I have to say that, ALL OF WYCLEF'S CDs ARE GREAT...yes that includes Masquerade. I am only dissapointed that...THE FUGEES BROKE UP. They are by far the best rap group and truly defined hip-hop, but I am gettin off subject.Wyclef haves you feel his lyrics, sort of like 2Pac, yet in a reggae way.My favorite tracks are, ""Celebrate""-Patty Lebelle is great on this track,""Take Me As I Am"", this is probably my favorite track on the album, ""Next Generation""-this track is tied with ""Take Me As I Am""...So, go by the freakin CD, and dont be like the idiot who gave this album 2 stars, Its real R&B, I bet that is the kind of person that listens to Meatloaf or Marylin Manson, SO GET OFF THE HIP-HOP TURF, GOTH..."
5,"Wyclef's best album, without a doubt","After somewhat petering out with ""2 Sides to a Book"" and ""Masquerade,"" Wyclef Jean returns in full form with his near masterpiece ""The Preacher's Son."" Jean brings an internationalism and a certain amount of literacy to the hip-hop, pop, rock, soul and world music worlds, which is a much-needed quality absent from most of today's music. The collaboration with Patti LaBelle is unique and absolutely stunning, one of the best recordings of the year. Congratulations Wyclef, for stepping up to the ocassion, for being a total survivor and for providing us with one of the most sophisticated albums of 2003. Great cover too."
4,Clef does it again,"I was really impressed with this album. It is nearly as good as his masterpiece, Carnival. The CD has a good flow to it, and it doesnt have to make references to guns or gangs, and even keeps the weed out of it for the most part. Eminem made fun of Will Smith for saying that you dont have to ""cuss or use drugs to sell an album,"" but that is truly the case here. When your as talented as Clef I guess its really not a challenge to do so. Again, not quite Carnival, but its much better than Masquerade or Eclectic."
3,Pretty Good still ain't touching the Carnival,this Album is easily better than His last two Albums put together but that ain't saying much.Vocally He is cool as long as He is focused on doing His thing.the Missy tracks are filler to me.when he is focused though you get the Talented Cat that showed so much promise back in 97-98.this Album is a Step back in the right direction but I still think sooner or later He has to hook back up Musically with Lauyren Hill&get a Project out again as the Fugees.
5,CD + DVD = GREATNESS,"I admit the cd is probably a 3, 3.5 out of 5, but the dvd jam session is worth a seperate 10 to 15 bucks easily. Check it out, def worth the money"
5,GOD OF MUSIV,"I had already heard about Wyclef Jean. But the first time, his music really reach me was when I was working at the music caranal at Quebec. I was working there, and I miss his show!! And the critics were soooo goood. So I had to buy his album.. I hadn't heard one song yet... And the first time I putted on...I couldn't beleive how It was good. Starting with:Industry : talks about the all those rappersParty to dasmacus : A great party song!!!celebrate : younghood momories...great songbaby daddy : this one touch me right inside...he's taalking about step-fathers and their hard timesthree nights in rio- A great dance song--great beatclass reunion--- this song is so cute!And all the rest...are so much better from I'm your doctor, to take me as i am to party to dasmascus remix ( which he talks in french in it )You need to buy this!"
3,not like new,"ok condition but no like new like advertised or compared to other CD's that are like new. There were slight marks on the CD, more like ""slightly used"""
4,I'm now a Wyclef fan,"This was the first Wyclef anything that I've ever bought, and I was pleasantly surprised. The stand-out tracks for me are ""Celebrate"" featuring Patti LaBelle, ""Take Me As I Am,"" and ""Rebel Music."" I also really appreciate the consciousness of ""Industry."" I'm not the biggest ""rap"" fan, but I really appreciate those MC's/rappers/artists, like Wyclef, OutKast, Common, etc. This album proves that Wyclef can talk about a variety of issues without resorting to the kinds of played out, stereotyped rhetoric that other artists have resorted to."
4,No Denying this is a worthy collection,"Though for the most part a collaborativeeffort, these tales flow seamlessly, insidiouslycreeping up on you, leaving you with a tasteof death and pain, and, dare I say it, alonging to live life to the fullest while youstill can.""The Collective"" is a twisted, noirish piecethat crackles with energy and has a killerlast line.""Gone is the Wind"" is filled with lurking dread,a tale set in the urban decay of Modern dayEngland, with all that that implies.""Fatale"" is a harrowing journey about all thethings that matter: love, death, and companionship.And ""Walking"" is a story off loneliness, disconnection,and the passing on of time-honored rituals; a piece thatwill linger with you long after you've read it.These are just some of the highlights. All of these taleshave something to say. Some of them sneak up onyou with quiet menace, while others have a more directenergy. There's no denying, though, that Denying Deathis a collection well worth your time."
1,AVOID this CD - This is NOT the real ASIA from the 80's,"It may be a cheap disk, but they should pay us to suffer through it. It's a live disk, so I expected sound and performance quality to not be up to studio album standards, but this was REALLY BAD. The audio quality sounds like it was recorded on one of those old mono cassette recorders. The vocal and musical performances are abysmal. I don't know if John Payne has any talent - but he has no business trying to sing these songs. Not only does he not sound anything like John Wetton, this is closer to screeching.It wasn't until after I bought it and was astounded at how bad it was did I look up the band's post 80's history. In all fairness - shame on me for a $6 impulse purchass. The original band is back together (as ""ASIA"" vs. this disks ""Asia featuring John Payne"" mess).All appologies to the members of this Asia impersonator group if you happen to read this - nothing personal - but you really suck at recording the original guys' music."
5,America: Live in Chicago [Blu-ray],"America: Live in Chicago [Blu-ray]If you love America then this is the Blu ray to get an start Rocking Out!!! Turn up the old sound system and ENJOY the SOUND and VIDEO of some of AMERICAS BEST sounds on this BLU-RAY. Sounds likeA Horse With No Name, Ventura Highway & ""The Last Unicorn""+20-songs memorable Sounds well worth the $10.29 for this Blu-ray + you dub off the sound and you have a MP3 quality disk. Can't beat that. I highly recommend this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Glad I bought this,I'm a big fan and i'm just so glad they made this great souvenir. Excellent video and audio quality. And the price is unbelievably cheap. I'd pay 30$ for this.Thanks America.
4,Love it,"All the great music we love from America. It's a little weird seeing them now, though, but their voices haven't changed at all."
4,One of the best yet,"This is a great performance by America and a nice mix of their content. I have several of their DVD's and like this the best. Audio is great. Video is mixed. Close-ups are clear, but some distance camera work is grainy. The interviews at the end are cool...esp the one with Steve Dahl (Chicago DJ) where Gerry plays Sister Golden Hair in the studio with Steve."
1,Wonderful Concert ruined by suspect camera work,Wonderful concert - sound and performance - ruined by horrible camera work - long distance shots are like looking through a blizard - Grain and more Grain. Disappointing to say the least because these shots could have been removed in a tight pre-edit.
5,EXCELLENT PURCHASE,"Excellent shipping, item the way was described, and shipping on time as they described. I love the dvd, was amazing to watched it and go back on time."
2,Not Accurate,"For a book to be used to teach people to use access-lists in Cisco hardware, this book contains entirely too many errors. The author should have either been more diligent or gotten a better (more Cisco knowledgable) proofreader. There are numerous ( I didn't bother to count) errors in both construction and application of the lists in this book."
2,Too many errors,"Book has good content, but unfortunately has far too many errors for me to recommend. I can understand having errors but some are far too obvious to be excused. No doubt the author is very knowledgeable, but I hope in the future his work is more carefully edited."
2,It's ok,"I guess these punches serve their purpose, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I read the reviews before buying. Apparently I was just looking at the price. The punches themselves are ok. The punched pictures you get from them are too small to do anything with. They've been sitting in the same place since I bought then and I really thought that I'd get a lot of use out of them. I was wrong."
2,An attempt by author 2 base history vs fiction on Bible,"Seller was great. Transaction A+. Would not reclmmend so highly the book itself. Not so much fiction as an attempt by Jewish author 2 justify why, according to Biblical& not historical perscective Hitler coyld not have won the war."
5,Air,"So much energy from just two people! Erik and Joel never fail to impress and this EP reinforces that claim. From the ashes of their pervious project, emerges this phoenix of a collection. The songs are heart felt, and they will touch yours."
1,unhappy with timing chain SET,"I ordered a timing set and only got the timing chain no gears.that is not a timing chain set. I feel like I was taken so do not buy from this company,I won't be making the same mistake again."
3,hdmi cable,I ordered the wrong cable so I can not tell you one way or the other. Igave it to a friend who said that it works great.
1,shel8989,"Bought this item to display computer monitor image on my HDTV> Item failed to function. HDTV kept saying ""weak or no signal""."
5,Aptly named! A simple but complete Biblical introduction!,"This Bible is wonderful. The simple (often rhyming) text, cute illustrations, and charming design are expertly done. Even better, it includes most of the essential truths of the Bible, from creation to the resurrection and even a sample 'law' and 'psalm'. We just can't believe how much it includes while being so brief and baby-friendly!Baby's First Bible does kind of skip explaining original sin. But for a text this short, it's not surprising. And sin is easy for a caregiver to explain along with the stories of creation (what did Adam and Eve do next?), or Noah's ark (why did the flood come?), or Jesus' death and resurrection (why did He do it?).We can't think of a better way to start learning about the world and our place in it. This is a must-have book for every family!"
3,"Not what I expected, but cute.","I guess I was expecting more pages than there was. My 9 month old still enjoys it, but I think I might get something with a lot more to it next time.(I love to read to her.) If I would have known there weren't that many pages/history from the Bible, I would have gotten something different. But it isn't a waste, like I said, my daughter still enjoys it :)"
3,Poor quality,"Book was good and so its color and illustration. But the quality was not so good. Board paper torn within 1 week of use. Since it is intended for kids, we expect bit more quality item. Same item I so earlier was bit more small in size with a clasp at the other edge to close it, I feel it was better for little hands to carry than the new big one."
1,Clay Aiken is the only Star on this CD,"I bought this CD thinking it would soon become my favorite holiday music, but instead I'm contemplating throwing it in the trash. Clay's voice is the only thing that makes it bearable. I can't believe the ""AI"" industry published such an awful CD. It's really quite depressing. I had bought 2, thinking of giving one as a gift, and quickly returned the unopened one to the store."
3,Still worth buying....,"As much as I love all of the artists on this CD, something just didn't quite click. The individually sung songs are great, especially Clay Aiken's First Noel, Kimberley Locke's Christmas Song, and Kelly Clarkson's two bonus tracks. Of the ensembles and duets, O Come, All Ye Faithful was the best, with beautiful harmonies. I'm not sure if the arrangements weren't to my liking, or if there were just too many people being spotlighted, making the CD seem disjointed.I have to say that Kimberley's voice is as smooth as silk, a joy to listen to. With all of the (well deserved) focus on Kelly, Ruben and Clay, I hope Kimberley doesn't get overlooked. She is one talented lady."
3,Great Christmassy CD,"I like the CD. Highlights include Tamyra Gray's soulful Silent Night, Ruben and Tamyra's duet (their voices blend well), smooth Justin and Santa Claus is coming to Town ensemble :)"
3,Clay is the best on this CD,Clay's rendition of The First Noel is the BEST on this CD although Justin Guarini was suprisingly not bad.
3,Very blah!,"I love Christmas music, but not this album. There are a few bright spots on it though. Clay Aiken and Kim Locke shine on their solo songs. Justin Guarini sounds much better than Ruben Studdard. The rest are throwaways."
2,Rating of Reviewers - Disappointed at Bias and Bashing,"While I'm disappointed in the CD, I'm more disappointed in several reviewers who are trashing some singers in order topresent their favorites in a better light. It is unfortunate and obvious. My guess is that these young singers would rather have their fans praise them instead of focusing on putting someone else down.Because of the ill will of many reviewers, I'm not going to give my own review. Avoid the reviews. Listen to song snippets, find someone you can trust to tell you the truth, or borrow a copy from the library before you purchase so you can make up your own mind.You may find that you love the performance of your preferred singer and are still willing to buy the CD for that one song."
1,Avoid. For the love of God AVOID!!!!!!!!!,"The success of the whole ""American Idol"" series is one of the most distrubing developments in American popular culutre in recent memory. What we have here is safe, bland production from more 15 minute waanabes being marketed to a public totally devoid of soul or passion. More music headed for the elevators, dentist offices, and mini malls of America. Please. No more."
1,kelly clarkson needs to just go....,man this girl can ruin a good song...I will never understand how she ever beat out tamyra gray or how she even made it thru the auditions...oh that's right this stuff is fixed...
3,Buy This CD!!!!,"You heard me, Buy this CD ....Open it ...Toss the main CD in the trash ...Play the Kelly Clarkson bonus cd over and over and overEnjoy!"
3,Let's be realistic here,"okay I have to admit here I'm a die hard clay fan. he's got a lovely voice. Stop bashing him already people.now for you kelly fans. I like kelly too. I have to admit tho I loved Amy grants version of My grown up christmas list and its been a favorite of mine forever. but I just dn't like this rendition.Doesn't everyone else think that people should stop bashing? I means seriously, we all have our favorites but at least be fair.Also no offense but kelly does get the most recognition on this cd. two songs to everybody's truly one. Clay has one and a half, so does Kim. Ruben I think has two. everyone else essentially one. So really RCA is really trying to push the kelly thing. its starting to get annoyuing anyhoo see you later!"
3,pretty good,"Not an amazing Cd. It seemed a bit more traditional like background music. It lacked the pizzazz synonymous with American idol. Kelly was great, but Clay was disapointing in that he never used all of his voice or intensity. The songs were slow with not much build or intensity . The only song that will tap your foot is Ruben's ""This Christmas"", but it wouldnt be anything without its instrumentation. All in all I wasn't impressed. Clay's and Kelly's CD were much better."
3,Tamyra and Kim outshine others,"Many great songs on this cd, many mediocre songs as well. Kelly hit one and missed the other, Justin did well, Christina did will, Clay did ok.Tamyra shined in both of her songs, using powerful vocals and a lot of soul. Kim Locke also shined in her solo. Ruben Studdard also gets an honorable mention."
2,Dont waste your money,"on this excpet for the two songs that Clay and Kim do,the rest of them should have stayed home.Kelly ruined the best Christmas song ever ""Oh Holy Night"" with her terrible voice and honestly the rest of them need to go back to where they came from...dont waste your money on this unless you are a huge Clay or Kim L fan"
2,Kelly Only,Too bad they couldn't just have Kelly Clarkson singing the entire album herself. I can't stand Clay Aiken's over-pronunciation glory noting. I'd just buy Kelly's Grown-up Christmas List and O' Holy Night on iTunes
2,Two Stars for Kelly Clarkson!!!!!!!!,"Kelly Clarkson's renditions of ""O Holy Night"" and ""My Grown-up.."" are the best songs on this Christmas CD. Her voice is so mature and defined and soulful; therefore, makes her one of the best out there today. I only heard the CD with the other wannabes like once, and once was enough, except for Tamayra, she's okay. Clay Aiken is sooooo overrated it's sickening. He's soooo broadway!!! The two stars are for Kelly Clarkson's contributions to this CD. Kelly Clarkson can really make buying a boring album into something worthwhile!!!"
1,dont buy it,look this cd sucks cuz not evryone from american idol 1 and 2 are here this cd should have ft. everyone will if u like the people in this cd buy it but if your fave. idol isint on this cd dont buy it cuz it wont be worth the money hearing someone u dont like sing this cd should have evryone from american idol 1 and 2 on
3,"Clay is amazing, then Kimberley","I bought this cd for two songs, the first noel by Clay and Silver bells-a duet by Clay and Kimberley. I didn't even care about the others. So, hey, its not great except those two songs are amazing!!!"
3,"Some Great, Some Awful","Clay's ""First Noel"" is powerful, as is Kelly's ""O Holy Night"" and Tamyra's ""Silent Night"". The group's ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" is terrific. I could have done without the rest, although I have to agree w/ the reviewer who said Justin was ""surprisingly not bad"". I liked Kimberly Locke on the show, but she does not shine on this CD. Ruben is consistent, but boring. And Christina Christian (who I also liked very much on the show) was, well I don't know how to put it nicely. She must have been encouraged to make up for her mediocre singing voice by trying to sound sexy....it doesn't work. She sounds like a female Jimmy Stewart, or something (Shleigh bells ring, are you lishtenin'?). No offense to Christina, she seems like a very nice person and is drop-dead gorgeous....but I think maybe singing is not for her. The CD is worth buying, though, for the half that's good."
4,"Buy it for Silver Bells, First Noel, and The Christmas Song","The two voices that really stood out for me on this CD were Kimberley Locke and Clay Aiken. Separately and blended together, they beautifully evoked the holiday season. I bought the CD after hearing their songs and they remain my favorites. Santa Claus Is Coming to Town was also fun. The rest are pleasant enough, but none of the other songs or singers stood out for me."
4,This Christmas CD,"My impressions of this album are overall positive. I first would like to say that I respect how the producer/s of this album recruited the most talented American Idol contestants who are: Tamyra, Clay, Ruben, Kimberley Locke, and Kelly. My favorite contestant is definitely the amazing TAMYRA GRAY. She sings passionately, beautifully, and eloquently. I LOVE HER VOICE!!! Although, I feel that Christina's performance of ""Winter Wonderland"" is weak and ordinary, due to her soft and underdeveloped voice, the other talented singers make up for her weaknesses. Moreover, I am disappointed that my girl Trenyce is not featured on this album. She is one of my favorites. Nevertheless, I would encourage American Idol fans to purchase this Holiday album. Besides, the radiant TAMYRA IS FEATURED ON IT. Yes, I am a little biased because I am a huge Tamyra fan. Wishing everyone peace, happiness, progress, and great listening.TRAZON"
4,Only two stars shine here!,"First song on the cd is done by Clay Aiken. I have never heard ""The First Noel"" done better and with such reverence and grace to the powerful ending. When I hear a hymn this is how I want it done. Very disappointed with the sound and background mix of some of the other songs on the first disc. Kelly Clarkson's added tracks were well done as she gives a soulful rendition of ""Oh Holy Night"", did not like the vocal add ins and a little overdone. I prefered her second choice better of ""My Grown Up Christmas List"" which is also the best rendition of that song I have ever heard."
3,Pretty good,"I wasn't sure about this CD at first. I only bought it because of Clay, so I wasn't really planning on liking much of the rest of the CD. However, it's pretty good. Clay, of course, get's all of the stars I could possibly give him. His version of ""The First Noel"" is beautiful, and he also sings on ""Silver Bells"", ""Oh Come All Ye Faithful"", and ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"", so I definitely think Clay fans should buy this. I also thought Kelly sounded really good on ""Oh Holy Night"" and ""My Grown Up Christmas List,"" but as usual, I was a little bit disappointed that she gave it her touch of soul. I think Christmas songs sound better as pop, but maybe that's just me. I also really enjoyed Kim Locke. The rest of the idols were good, but not really my cup of tea. I like more than 75% of this album, and it really put me in the Christmas mood, so I would recommend it!"
4,Clay Aiken Shines/Justin Gurini Surprises,"The only real reason worth buying this cd is because of Clay Aiken. He does The First Noel. His sexy and beautiful lower register is so awesome. Justin Guarini is actually pretty good also. He seems to be learning from his past mistakes. Ruben is so so. Kelly Clarkson does ok on one song, but screetches her way through O Holy Night. That should be a song for Aiken. His lower register on First Noel would sound a hundred times better on O Holy Night. Why does Kelly have to shout all of her songs? Holy Night is sung with all the subtlety of Miss Independent. Kim Locke, Tanya Gray, and Christina Christin don't sound too different from each other."
2,Justin Guarini is the only reason to buy this CD,"If it weren't for Justin Guarini being on this CD, I wouldn't have bought it. I generally do not buy Christmas music, but I bought it because I heard clips from the songs online and Justin's voice was so angelic I had to have this CD. The CD does not disappoint as far as Justin's voice goes. His song, I'll Be Home For Christmas, is a gorgeous rendition I will love to hear over and over this season and all year round. His a capella singing in O Come All Ye Faithful is so beautiful it gives me chills. Some of the other singers did a fine job, too, most notably Tamyra and Kimberly, but Ruben and Clay did not shine, nor did I love the Kelly songs on the bonus CD. Christina should not have even been on this CD and unfortunately her song sounds much worse than she has sounded in the past.Overall, a decent CD, but not completely wonderful top to bottom. Still, for Justin's contributions, I recommend it."
4,Good pop style,"In my opinion this is a great CD. It's soulful/pop style, not the fake fluffy nonsense that gives this music genre a bad rap. Tamyra is my favourite, it's crazy how she's not more popular. Clay sounds great too, as does Kim. I like all of them but those three are my utmost favourites. If you really like this style of music you should really add it to your Holiday collection!"
3,Kimberley Locke and Tamyra Gray standouts,"I found the standouts on this cd to be Tamyra and Kimberley Locke. I was impressed by the range, control, tone and power on their voices, and think they add quite nicely to their duets. Hearing their voices chime in on the group numbers, I was left wanting to hear a duet with these ladies, and a bonus track of these two singing together would have been a delight. As they stand alone, Tamyra singing ""Silent Night,"" and Kim, ""Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire,"" they make this cd worth the purchase."
3,Justin Guarini is the only reason to buy this CD,"I am not usually a buyer of Christmas music, but because I heard some clips online, I decided to buy this one, mostly because of Justin Guarini's beautiful, angelic voice. His song, I'll Be Home For Christmas, is wonderful and will be one to hear over and over, all year round. Some of the other singers had nice renditions, too, notably Tamyra and Kimberly Locke. I was disappointed in Clay's and Ruben's tracks, and thought Christina should have been left off the CD entirely. Kelly's bonus songs are all right, she sings them well enough. But the best part, aside from Justin's solo, is when he sings the a capella part in O Come All Ye Faithful. It is captivating and gorgeous, and gives me chills to hear it. That is the only reason I would recommend this CD, just to hear Justin's a capella voice on it."
2,Should have waited.....,A few of the songs are pretty good but most are just poor examples of a quick attempt to capture the publics bucks!If you want a GREAT Christmas CD... spend your money on Whitney's new one! It's awsome!
1,Only liked 1 song!!!,"The one song I liked was Clay Aikens the First Noel, which is FANTASTIC, but the other songs, just not good enough!!! I should of just bought the 1 song solo by Clay!!!!"
5,We love American Idol,"This was a great CD for any fan of American Idol. I still play it every season for Christmas and then some. Great CD, nice Christmas music"
2,Clay Aiken's the only great talent here...,"Aside from Clay Aiken's spectacular vocals for ""The First Noel,"" Clay Aiken and Kimberley Locke's ""Silver Bells,"" and the ensemble's ""O Come, All Ye Faithful,"" the other songs are merely mediocre. Tamyra Gray's ""Silent Night"" would've have been much more beautiful if she hadn't lisped on ""Christ the Savior is born"". As I've said, the rest were merely mediocre and become tiring after listening to the CD a few times. They could've done much better.I recommend Clay Aiken's Christmas CD much more over this CD, unless you really love some of the singers on this CD."
3,It's only all right.,"Ooooh, it's only all right, which is a real surprise considering the great offerings in the AI2 compilation.It's not that bad at all. It's just that expectations are higher after being spoiled by the AI2 compilation.But none the less, why not, one for the stocking... it is Christmas."
4,great for the most part,"the majority of the songs were great. I have to say that my favorite song was ""This Christmas""... it was absolutely perfect! However, I was disappointed with Kelly Clarkson... I love the songs, but she was off on some of the pitches on both of her songs. I expected more out of her. Other than that though, the cd was awesome."
3,Good Holiday Album.,"There is just something about a Christmas song; it puts me in a good mood, no matter where I am. Sure, I have heard better versions of some of these songs, but it's still nice to listen to. My personal favorites on this album are Tamyra Gray's Silent Night (it's very soulful) and the extra disc with Kelly Clarkson's versions of O Holy Night and My Grown-Up Christmas List is just amazing. Another good one is the Group on O Come All Ye Faithful, and Ruben and Tamyra's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Clay Aiken's The First Noel is OK, although a little on the boring side. Over all, it's a pretty good Holiday album, I would recommend it. :)"
4,Overall a good cd,"The best songs on this CD come from Kelly Clarkson, Tamyra Gray and Kimberly Locke. Kelly's rendetion of My Grown Up Christman List is even better than Natalie Cole's version which is hard to believe. She uses the voice I fell in love with on American Idol. Very sexy and a great range. Oh Holy Night is great as well and again shows why she was the winner of the show, although Tamyra is equally as good as Kelly. Kimberly has a pure rich voice which reminds me a little of Karen Carpenter. Clay is very good on this CD as well. I could have lived without Justin as his voice again sounds like a Vegas lounge singer. Christina and Ruben were both pretty good, but not as well as the rest of the singers."
4,Clarkson outshines them all !,"This a great Christmas Cd.The best I've ever had.Kelly Clarkson, Tamyra Gray, and Kimberly Locke are FANTASTIC!Clay and Ruben are boring and Christina and Justin are just average.The one who makes this CD Great is Clarkson, with her own bonus Cd that includes two tracks,Oh Holy Night and My Growen-Up Christmas List ( which wen't to number 17 on the Charts in December).She's just Great!I f your are an American Idol fan this is a MUST HAVE for the holidays!"
3,clay aiken,"I really bought this cd to get clay aiken's the first noel and acouple other songs including silver bells. The cd is pretty good,but only bought it to get clay's songs."
4,Nice Album--great price,"The album was in great shape, the music was nice at Christmas, and the price was right. I have no complaints."
4,AMERICAN IDOL: THE GREAT HOLIDAY CLASSICS,"A good rendition from former American Idol contestants. I especially liked KellyClarkston's version of Grown Up Christmas list, which was my main reason for purchasing this CD. Although it is the same songs done by many artists in the past it is still a nice CD to have during the Holiday season."
1,Don't waste your money,"This CD is just not worth it. The only high point is Clay Aiken's First Noel and even that is not one of his greatest. He's still very good, of course because of that VOICE, and I also enjoyed his duet with Kim Locke. The rest of the gang are not in the least noteworthy. The ensemble pieces, in particular, I found to be grating - their voices just don't mesh very well, with the powerful voices of Aiken, Locke and Studdard doing a disservice to the weaker voices contributed by the rest of the ensemble. Give Aiken and Locke their own Christmas CD next year. That will make up for the money wasted this year."
3,Ho Ho Hum,"The performances on this CD are rather average with the exception of Clay Aiken's The First Noel. It's an okay CD, but only Aiken's voice really shines."
2,Clay Shines!,The only song I like on this CD is The First Noel by Clay Aiken! His voice stands out from all the rest. It's just too bad he couldn't have sang O Holy Night... and all the rest of the songs!!!
2,LIKED ONE SONG!!!!,"I have this cd, I like ONE song on this entire cd!! ONE!!! The First Noel by Clay Aiken is WONDERFUL!! That is the only one I like though, for Clays one song I would give 5 stars, but the cd over all will get a 2 from me. Kelly is ok, Christina just sounds terrible to me, Ruben is like out of breath or something, not sure about why he sounds so terrible. Kim is ok, and Tamyra, well, just didn't work."
3,Only 10 tracks total on 2 cd's,"I enjoy the cd and some voices other than the old standards,but i received mine as a gift. On my copy In total, there are only 10 tracks and of these only 2 on disk 2!! GO figure, Thus its overpriced based on quantity of music."
4,SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FEW DUETS WITH KELLY & JUSTIN,CD IS OK BUT AGAIN KELLY & JUSTIN STAND OUT. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A XMAS ALBUM ALL KELLY WITH A FEW DUETS WITH JUSTIN.LETS FACE IT KELLY HAS NO PEERS & JUSTIN WOULD HAVE WON HANDS DOWN AGAINEST LAST YEARS GROUP.

4,A Look at Religious Violence,"A Look at Religious ViolenceMark Juergensmeyer's book ""Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence"" undertakes a comparative study of religious terrorism using extensive interviews with participants. Juergensmeyer compares Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, and Buddhhist advocates of religiously inspired violence. His analysis indicates that within the logic of religious violence, violence takes on symbolic rather than strictly strategic significance. Those participating in the acts regard them as religious performances in a cosmic war of good against evil. In sociological terms, these performances also empower the alienated and marginalized in society. Juergensmeyer concludes by suggesting solutions to the problem of religious violence by providing more outlets for religion in public life."
2,Disappointed,"Would have been happy enough, but one of the shoes digs into my ankle, and literally scratches it every time I wear it. I have to put on a bandaid and really thick socks just to wear this boot. I'd recommend spending a little more to make sure you get a well crafted boot. Perhaps I got a 'bad' one of the lot, but, with what I paid for this, could I expect more?"
5,REALISTIC DRIVING EXPERIENCE,"Outstanding! The copy protection kind of stinks but the software itself is GREAT! Very, very realistic driving experience. On-screen performance matches the true vehicle's performance. Many customizaton options. I did end up downloading a ""cheat"" to give me more options rather than win them racing 4 cylinder econo-racers but the overall experience is outstanding! I would highly recommend this software to any racing enthusiast!"
2,Missing the online registration code,"This is a cool game in a lot of ways. I was jazzed about it because of the era it represents. But the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting.The huge disapointment, however, is this: The online registration code is missing. Utterly missing. And there is no resource available on the net to help. The U.S.A. help number is disconnected. You will not be able to play online. Period. The developer's forums are full of posts about this problem. No resolution.... Beware.Demand more of the makers of the products you purchase. This is extremely bad."
1,Won't work on Windows 7,"The game itself is spectacular, especially if you install the player made mods that improve the game. However, the Starforce copy protection makes it so it does not work at all on Windows 7 and in fact makes it so Windows 7 can't even boot and has to revert to a previous restore point. They are selling a digital version without Starforce on SimBin's website though so you should definitely play this but get that version instead."
4,A top notch racing game!,"At last, a company that can put out serious racing games like the now-defunct Papyrus (Grand Prix Legends, Nascar Racing 2003). This game and GTR, also put out by SimBin, will keep PC gearheads busy with endless tweaking abilities, online racing and endless challenges that never get old. It is also easy to get into as a novice in the rookie mode, while the Papyrus games had a punishing learning curve. Heck, my 6 year old loves this game! I though I wound never see a good PC racing game again, seeing that they will never be ""blockbusters"" like Doom, etc. and make loads of money.I too was concerned with the ""Starforce"" copy protection, but, after 3 months of use, I have had no hardware/software problems, although I hate swapping discs in and out of the CD drive. I can't find a no CD patch for this one.My rig runs this nicely at 12x7, 32 bit, 2x antialiasing. DX9 mode.3ghz P4, nvidia 6600GT (128MB video ram) 1 ghz ram."
3,do have plenty of time?,"I love GTR, its awsome and I still play it, even after buying GTL. GTL has nice graphics and sound and the simulation feels good (but a 65 mustang is VERY different than a Saleen GT car), just like GTR.So why do I play GTR then? Because GLT requires you to unlock cars and tracks, like most silly console games. Being a ""gearhead"" myself I barely have enough time to play games at all, so spending hours to unlock the features isnt an option. When you start the game, you have access to about 3/90 cars. I emailed SimBin about this, but like other reviewers, have received no responce.Who in SimBin's marketing department thought that race car simulation players (who adjust spring rates and torsion settings for FUN) want ""leveling"" in thier games?!?"
4,GT Legends Great Fun,I am an older guy who can remember these great cars from the 60's and the races they ran. This is a terrific game and great fun. It installed and ran without a hitch (except I had to call the company to get the online code - a real person answered the phone and sent me the code immediately - amazing customer service). I am very pleased with this game and can't believe you can get such a quality game for such a low price.
2,Que estaba pensando!!!,"No sé que rayos me sucedió, no tengo la menor idea de por qué compré este cd, tal vez estaban de moda pero ya no, pues no he vuelto a tocar ese cd desde hace long time ago."
5,Channellock 410 1-1/8-Inch Jaw Capacity 9-1/2-Inch Double Tongue and Groove Plier,I pick this one up today at a local hardware store. Very heavy duty and next to impossible to find at any big box or hardware store. I would recommend these 410 NUT BUSTER to anyone in need of removing rounded and rusted nuts and bolts.
4,Good Reference Starter,"I found the book is separated into 3 sections. The First third is about landscaping techniques for various locations of your property, the second third is basic care, pruning, planting, and transplanting techniques, and the last third is a photo gallery of shrubs along with their names, and care instructions. Overall its a great starter book and I find myself carrying this book with me to all the nurseries to use as reference. However, this book is thin and can only cover a limited amount of shrubs. I would have seperated the last third from the first two and made 2 books, once you read the landscaping and planting sections the only reason you hold this book is for the photo gallery. For a more complete photo reference I would recommend Dirr's Hardy Tree and Shrubs book, and use the Ortho book as a supplement."
2,All About Shrubs Book,"Should be entitled ""a little something about shrubs"". It certainly is not ""all"" about shrubs."
3,OUTDATED LOOKING EVEN IN ITs DAY,Warner's idea of continuing to produce large budget town taming Westerns was something of a myth by the time this film was released in 1950. The idea was old and the film even looks older than it is because of it save for the John Twist's script and Stuat Heisler's direction. The film's opening shootout was a clever piece of scripting and the idea of Gary Cooper and Leif Erickson switching identities is well executed. These are good techniques that enhance the characters but not the plot. The basic premise of cleaning up a Western town is still filmed with very little innovation in standard pre-1950 Hollywood style.
2,really bad casting,"Here we have the obvious Yankee Gary Cooper cast as a outlaw Confederate officer. This one if it played in the south got boos.This movie isn't High Noon:High Noon (Collector's Edition). Gary Cooper's acting is actually pretty good for a western, his accentjust won't pass for southern."
1,Yagggh!,Completely stupid and boring so-called western. A real let-down. To be avoided by all costs!
3,"Routine, But Never Boring","DALLAS is a routine action/western, the sort of thing John Wayne did in his sleep for Republic throughout the forties. And why shouldn't Coop be permitted to amble through this sort of stuff? And amble he does, looking terrific in his tan buckskin shirt, every inch the hero. The movie is never boring and it zips merrily along, from one action sequence to the next, pausing for an occasional breath so that Cooper and Ruth Roman can set up their eventual kiss at the end. I agree with the previous two reviews that Max Steiner's score is fabulous (far better than the film deserves, truth be told). I also agree that Steiner's score for THE HANGING TREE is ""utterly sublime"". Not only isn't the score out on CD, but Warner Home Video has taken THE HANGING TREE out of distribution here in the U.S. Not overseas, just here! What idiocy! Furthermore, why?"
3,Circles and circles and circles...,"This is the story of karma.As another reviewer wrote, it is also a story that is not so easily followed. Scratch that. It isn't hard to follow, but there are so many ""wait, isn't that the same guy who..."" moments that the reader finds herself wanting to start again to make sure she's missed nothing.The only issue I truly have with this book is that it is wrapped up too quickly. Relationships progress too easily in the end, and side plots and motivations are almost viciously cut off.Still, though, I found the levels of love demonstrated in this book to be amazing. A very interesting concept for a book.(*)>"
5,NO I AM NOT JOKING!!!!,"DUDE, ITS REALLY WORTH IT. Priqles ""DIE!"" IS WRONG. HE DOES NOT KNOW THE STORY AND VERTICAL HORIZON WAS FORCED TO DO THIS. DONT LISTEN TO THAT GUY. GO 2.0 IS SO GREAT"
4,Go get it,"I've noticed that a lot of the negative reviews for Vertical Horizon's latest album Go state that the album isn't as good as Everything You Want. There IS some truth to that, but in my opinion, Everything You Want was a flawless album and it's very hard to pull that off twice. Still, there are many good moments to be found on THIS album.If you like contemporary rock, then you should be satisfied with songs like ""Echo"" and the mellow ""Underwater"". The first single ""I'm Still Here"" is also worth hearing as it is a very introspective song, and I personally don't understand how it passed by the radar screen. Negative songs also work well, as evident by ""Goodbye Again"" and ""It's Over"".If there's anything bad to say about this album, it's that a few of the songs have choruses that could stand a rewrite, like ""Sunshine"" and ""Forever"". Oh well, the album is still great. While it's not classic material like Everything You Want, Go is still worth adding to your collection.Anthony Rupert"
5,Great album,"I've always liked Vertical Horizon, but never owned any of their albums. This was a good one to start with!!"
5,"Back, and better then ever!","I had never really heard of Vertical Horizon until their '99 release of ""Everything You Want"" but the first time I heard that song, i was hooked. Since then, I have purchased all of their available albums, and i like almost all their songs, with a few exceptions. However, i can say that their latest album, ""GO"" is by far, in my opinion, their best work yet. So often I buy an album by someone for a certain song, and thats the only one i like on the whole cd. Not so here though. Every song on this album is fantastic. My 2 personal favorites, Forever and Echo, are just absolutly amazing. Keep up the good work guys, this is truly the best cd I have bought in years!"
3,"Good, but too formulaic","Everything you want was amazing. Then they framed every song on this album for hit radio. It's great listening, but low on the imagination. It'll probably have radio play which is what they're after. It' a slight disappointment for me, but they'll probably try something new on their next outing. The drummer added a lot of flavor to this record though. He even threw in a china cymbal to good effect."
3,"Good, but.....","To preface, I own all of their CDs and have been known to annoy my wife into nearly leaving me for wanting to listen to VH more than she does....Enjoyed the album and probably have lost some hearing due to excessive loud playing of this CD. The only problem I have might be that the songs are starting to become more homogeneous due to MS doing all of the song-writing now. [acoustic lead in to heavy guitars on several songs]. He's also clearly mastered the rock formula of shorter phrasing and rhymes galore, which has made their tunes much more friendly to radio-play than their older, more eclectic stuff (which I enjoyed...). I do, however, think that some of the lyrics felt more forced than in EYW, which is the better album of the two.All-in-all a solid CD, but after several years without an album, I was hoping for a bit more..."
5,They just keep getting better,"I had never really been a fan of these guys until ""Everything You Want"" came out, then I bought that album and was very glad I did. I've had that album for years, and I'm still not tired of listening to it. They have a sound that you can listen to all day, the flow of the melodies and the meaningful lyrics make for excellent music. It's the kind of music you can listen to on a gloomy day to lift your spirits, or driving down the road alone on a sunny afternoon with the music blasting as loud as you want while you sing along. Oh, and these guys sound even better live. They performed at my college a few years ago and blew me away. I took the liner notes from my cd with me to the concert (you know, just in case) and not only did each member sign all the autographs the students wanted but they greeted each of us with a smile even though it was absolutely freezing. All around great guys, great musicians, and timeless music that keeps getting better with each album."
2,what happened?,"i can't believe this album. i liked they're first album; i loved their second album; and i absolutely loved their third album; but i only like 1 song on this album. ""won't go away"". it's a great song.perhaps some of the other songs have alright verses, but most of the songs are too unoriginal and not even good. i guess ""forever"", ""goodbye again"", and ""it's over"" are alright, ie. not THAT bad. i can understand how someone could think that ""inside"" is good too, but it isn't. ""when you cry"" has been done a million times, and ""i'm still here"" has been done before too. ""echo"" is just plain irritating, and ""underwater"" is just plain boring, not beautiful. and i think it's been done a million times before too."
4,Very good CD,"I am not a fan of pop music in general, but this CD is an exception.The songs are all 'catchy tunes' with enough of a rock element thrown in to remind you that you are not listening to a Top 40 station.Too bad the band has broken up, from what I hear."
4,Good but repetitive,"I like this album. My favorite song is ""I'm still here"" but mostly because of the meaning it has to me. But like their previous album, although their music is often fun and has interesting (and good) messages, I find their musical style a bit repetitive between songs, so that I get tired of the album after a while."
4,Some good stories well told,"There is some interesting information and some great stories, also the dialect writing is intriguing. Katharine Briggs is a giant in the field, although her taxonomic dissection of fairies into long lists of beings is a little tiresome to me these days. Great for younger readers with selection by parents, although I don't have children, I think I would read this to them if I did."
5,An inspirational survey of how to reach out in an alternative manner.,"Efrem Smith and Phil Jackson's THE HIP-HOP CHURCH: CONNECTING WITH THE MOVEMENT SHAPING OUR CULTURE provides an important survey which advocates reaching spiritual souls through their own language - the music of hiphop. From understanding hiphop culture to bringing it into the church, any involved in a church and seeking to involve urban youth must have THE HIP-HOP CHURCH: it's an inspirational survey of how to reach out in an alternative manner."
4,track listing,"I'm A Believer, Fast Lanes And Country Roads, I'd Fall In Love Tonight, Don't Look In My Eyes, Angel In Your Arms, For Your Love, If They Grow Tired Of My Music, You Only You, Survivors, When You Get To The Heart"
1,Not worth the money,"This book measures 8.5 x 5.5 inches and is 72 pages long from title page to last page. It is not much bigger than a thick pamphlet. Ms. Archer tends to repeat herself throughout the chapters, and the contents of this book could've probably been narrowed down to 30 pages. For instance, the index shows that dealing with the police is mentioned once, but I counted at least six places where she wrote about how to work around law enforcement.It's not that the information in this book in not helpful. I just expected more useful material than the commonsense information such as the importance of bathroom facilities and the necessity keeping warm."
1,rip off book F.J Archer should try another topic.,"This book is over priced at anything more than 5 bucks.The information on living in a car is much less thanwhat you can find just poking around the internet.http://www.carliving.net/intro.html is a good resource.There was no mention of cooking using a thermos in your car.nothing about using extra car batteries for cooking , heat, light, entertainment. I know a lady who washed her cloths ina ice chess on the way to work.nothing on using solar cells to keep your car charged.Nothing about Kmart's that allow for over night parking.You can set up a satellite link for internet , internet phone,etc.This book does not give you bad info.. only info that most ofus would already guess. Too much talking about peoples situationsthat have no or little bearing on the topic.64 pages is too little info for this subject.Add to that too little specifics and there you are.Yes I got ripped off by A. J Heim Archer."
2,"Lacking Substance, Boringly Vague","I was intrigued by the subject of Car Living and promptly ordered this book from an Amazon MarketPlace seller only to find it vaguely informative and not worth the $15 I spent on it. I read it in an hour and noted how repetitive the chapters were. Very little information was given and the majority of tips were plain common sense. Although the author tried her best to keep the reader interested, she failed. I was considering buying her second book on the subject but have since changed my mind. This one has already been relisted online."
1,70 pages,70 pages. 70 pages. 70 pages.Im not sure what book is worth 15$ for 70 pages. This is not it. If you live in a car you have better things to spend your money on. There are web sites that offer better advice.there are a lot of eccentric micro publishers on amazon that charge mysterious prices for their pamphlets.
3,Not as good as before,"The LotR TCG is a great game. The 4th block is a bit off the track, however. To restructure the game was a bitter idea."
4,Great Movie,"This movie was actually pretty entertaining. I love Cab Calloway ever since I discovered him in Stormy Weather. He is a great actor and great musician. If anyone has any other suggestions with him or the Nicholas Brothers (who aren't in this production) please do let me know.Also, be mindful that this movie was filmed in a different time period but have an open mind and enjoy it."
5,Could not have loved it more!,This book has taken hold of my heart and won't let go! I read this boook in one day and that was a first for me. In this book the characters seem so real that you feel like you are watching a movie. I finished to book and can not get it out of my mind. If I could recommend any book to lift somebodies soul this would be it. I wish there was a sequal!!
2,Super Cheesy Predictable Romance Novel,"Definitely beach reading. This was pretty trite and predictable, but that also made it almost a comedy for me. So I enjoyed it. I didn't see the cover because I bought it with my kindle (old model). I might have been clued in if I had seen the cover. Not to say we all shouldn't enjoy some breathless romance once and a while, but just be ready! Has several classic ""rescue"" scenes. Funny."
4,Amazon Lily,"I really liked this book, it was a great summer read. A little predictable but still good.I like all the aspects and will look for other books from this author."
5,Very well written,"since I started down loading books from ""Pixel of Ink"" I had wanted to get started reading this book. I finally decided to just do it and am so glad I did. The author did not linger on any one thing to make the book drag on and on and on. She also did not make every incident so short you could not get the the story. The amount of sex went very well with the story and did not get grossly detailed but, you knew what was happening. I especially loved how 'Lilly' realized how much she loved Ash and the Amazon and had no problem fitting in. It so nice to see a nice guy found under such roughness - a diamond in the rough! I will look forward to reading more books by this author if she kept writing like this!"
5,Must read !!!,"Love, hate, fear, bravery, confusion, clarity, opposites definitely attract in this surprisingly suspenseful and intriguing tale of two people and the dance they weave before they realize they are meant to be together."
2,Package came opened,"Original box of seeds was opened when it arrived and seeds were spilled all over other items that came with my purchase. I purchased this nut bar, shampoo, collars and liquid wormer for pets and all items came shipped together in one box. I didn't appreciate the fact that food and shampoo were packed in the same box. My birds love these seeds thats why I gave it 2 stars and not 1, cause product itself is OK. That being said, I am highly disappointed at Amazon for their lack of care. I am sure that they would refund or replace the item, but I am still deciding if its even worth to submit a request and have to deal with return shipping and so on for a few dollars. The only reason why I bought this online is so that I didn't have to go to store... This is a good lesson to learn that for perishable and liquid items is maybe better getting to store as it sure takes less time then online shopping and post office all together."
1,Broken out of the box,"We purchased this from an online retailer and as soon as we hooked it up it wouldn't work. The remote control worked for about 1 minute then nothing. Unplug the set, wait 30 seconds, plug in again and it would work. For 1 minute. We shipped it to Westinghouse at our expense ($50), and waited 2 months before receiving a replacement. Pay the extra $100-$200 and get a better set. It's worth it (I would have too)."
1,Stay away from this TV,Don't buy this or any other cheap sets like this. Repair parts for this particular set are no longer available.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought this tv at walmart for 700.00what a was of money. i havnt even owend it for 2 yrs yet. I was watching tv and changed the channel and the screen turn pink.. Theres no fixing it, cause it will cost just as much as buying a new tv. And im not dealing with westington after all the bad reviews i read about the customer service. I will never buy another tv from them again."
1,Sad Sally...,"I bought the Westinghouse 32"" sk-32h240s in April of 2008 at Best Buy and enjoyed it problem free until December of 2009. One day without warning the screen went black and never came back. I tried all of the trouble shooting suggested by Westinghouse and nothing worked. Buyer beware!"
1,After a year it will be a paper weight!,"It's a great product out of the box. While you will be impressed with the picture quality (sound is pretty tinny), be warned that you will only enjoy it for a short time. Product reliability is well below average.Do yourself a favor and invest in a little better quality now and save yourself the headache of replacing this unit after the 18 months it will last. Extended warranties/service plans DO NOT make owning this worth the hassle."
1,TV Freezes,Great TV when it works. Unfortunately it will occasionally freeze up. The only way to get it working again is to unplug it and then plug it in again.
1,Worked for 2 years...,"Just thought I'd add to the voices of caution...I own an older version of this TV (LTV-32w6HD)and it worked for just over 2 years. Nice TV while it lasted. Now the picture goes out after about 20-30 minutes of viewing. If you look at reviews on Consumer Reports, there are lots of people with similar problems after a year or so of ownership. As other reviewers have noted, the repair options are awful. Basically Westinghouse customer service told me it wasn't worth fixing, that I should ""upgrade."" Won't be ""upgrading"" to another Westinghouse, that's for sure. Save your money and avoid Westinghouse!"
1,This TV SUCKS,"The first one I bought lasted an astounding 1 day. I sent it back at my cost. 7 weeks later, and calling every day their customer service was opened, I got a replacement. I've had the replacement for 14 weeks. I know I have black line burned into the right side of the screen. An impossibility I was told on LCD televisions. And, I do. Oh, the TV was 1 week out of warranty when this occurred. Sorry.... Please save yourself the trouble. Save your money for a few more weeks, buy a better, more company-backed, television. DO NOT BUY Westinghouse. Let them whither and die. A bad memory of a company. On second thought, not even a memory, just a rumor that they actually once existed and made bad products. Westinghouse sucks."
1,"Looked promising, but you'll be out of luck if it breaks","I've never reviewed a product on Amazon before despite my many purchases here. However, I've been so frustrated by this particular TV that the time has come. I was able to use my TV for about 10 minutes - during which I have to say it looked and sounded pretty good - and then the sound went out. Completely. I returned the unit at my own cost to Westinghouse. That was in April 2008, this is almost July, and I still...don't...have a TV. Their warranty process is completely screwed up, and though the agents on the phone are plenty nice, they can't do a darn thing. So enjoy the TV if it works for you, but if it doesn't, be prepared for a long, drawn-out torture of customer service absurdity. You've been warned."
4,Great TV for the money,"I've had this TV for a little over a year now, so I've had plenty of time to formulate an opinion.-Pros-*Great Picture in any mode. I have a PS3 and watch Blu-Ray movies and they look incredible!*2 HDMI inputs*Big bang for your buck.*Its been over a year and haven't had any technical issues.-Cons-*Unimpressive sound quality. It isn't bad until you start turning it up pretty loud. I like movies rather loud, so thats where I had my issues with the sound.*Doesn't save your audio settings when you change your audio output from internal to external, so every time you turn your tv on and want to use your home theatre for cable/sattelite sound you have to reselect that option on the menu.-Summary-A very good picture with over a year of trouble free viewing. The cons are really minimal when you factor in everything you get for the price. I would highly recommend this TV to everyone."
1,DO NOT BUY...IT IS KNOWN TO FAIL!,"Purchased this TV from KMart 2 years and 3 months ago, worked OK for that time, then now I come to find out that there is a KNOWN PROBLEM with the right side of the tv, the backlight and inverters on the circuitry board fail, causing the TV to smell like burning wires, then it will only turn on for about 1-2 seconds, then shut off, although the sound still works.THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE, AMONG OTHER KNOWN ISSUES WITH THIS TV THAT SUGGEST IT WILL FAIL. THIS TV WILL FAIL. REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, EITHER. I wish I would have done more research before I purchased this piece of crap."
2,external audio stopped working,"All worked fine on this TV for first 13 months. Then the external audio jacks worked sometimes, sometimes there was no output. Now the jacks don't work now at all, even though I've selected ""external speakers"" on the on-line menu. So now I can use only the internal speakers. Bummer."
1,DON'T BUY A WESTINGHOUSE TV,"BEWARE:Don't buy a westinghouse tv !!! Their service is terrible. If you purchase a tv and something goes wrong it costs $55.00 to return it to them. Ours arrived defective and they refuse to pay return shipping even if faulty when it is brand new. The tuners are so problemsome the only repair center in Michigan has refused to repair them any longer.We returned ours and they replaced it with another, which as another person describes took forever. After a year the tuner started giving us problems and won't hold in the HDTV mode. No one in Michigan repairs them or carries replacement parts. This is probably why the other individual rating the tv's stated that Westinghouse was waiting for a replacement model. Parts are non existant. Please read ratings before purchasing a Westinghouse Tv. They are nice sets but if anything goes wrong you are out the total cost of your tv."
1,Junk Poor Quality!!!,"We purchased our TV on 2/22/08 and today is 4/6/09. The picture went out and we were only getting sound. When I called the customer service number and spoke to the representative they first told me to unplug the tv for about two minutes and turn back on then he had me press the menu button on the remote. It didn't work of course. ""Sounds like a panel issue"" per the rep. I asked how long the tv's last and he said about 5 years. I was shocked, I have had TV's for 15 plus years. No care at all about the tv only being a little over a year."
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this TV from Walmart. Big mistake. The audio and picture qualities were extrememly poor. Especially compared to similar TV's manufactured by other brands. After a week, the picture got worse and started to wash out. I returned the Westinghouse and purchased a Panosonic from a much better store. The Panosonic TV was well worth the extra money. And it is easier to hook up too."
1,Worked great...for a month,"I guess I made a mistake going against my better instincts and not buying a better known brand. The TV was great for about a month and then the picture just went crazy. Everything was covered in neon green static. I'm hoping to have better luck with customer service than some of the other people here, but after reading their experiences, I'm not too hopeful. Lesson learned, spend the extra money and get a quality brand."
1,DO NOT BUY,The back Light went in under two years. Not repairable! Costomer service not helpfull. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand.
2,Great... before it died.,"When I first got my Westy, it was wonderful. It had a great picture and was anything you could ask for with an HDTV.... and then 5 months after the purchase the power supply on my TV died. now I'm questioning the Westinghouse brand.On the other hand, Westinghouse customer service was awesome about it. I called them a few times with questions about the unit, and I only had to wait on hold once... for less than a minute. The customer service center is all in the U.S. as well.When I called about the bad TV they immediately arranged to take care of it.It was a good TV, they have good customer service, but the longevity of the unit is questionable."
1,Westinghouse 32 stinks!,"Seems to be a common problem after researching the web. We had this one for approx 6-8 months and then for no reason we now just get a black screen with sound. This seems to be a defect with this model, from what I have read online, but Westinghouse will only let you send it back to them IF it is still under warranty AND if you package it to their specifications AND if they deem it to be defective THEN they will give you another one.We didn't feel like jumping thru hoops and just decided to cut our losses and go with another brand."
2,really out of date and not too helpfull,"I found thins book to be not at all helpfull to me in moving to New Zealand. In fact I found it to be very out of date and the back section that talks about the Kiwi people and their way of life seemed depressing to me. I found the book to be constantly stereo typeing Kiwis. Sheep, beer, rugby etc. I think that the information in this book was true 10 years ago but a lot has changed in New Zealand in that time, especially in the cities. The information in this book is all available on the internet and it is constantly updated there."
3,This Book is good,"I read this book before i went on a vacation to New Zealand last year. It was fairly informative. If you have absolutely no knowledge of the country, this book will be very helpful. However books such as this one are not extremely useful, even if they were updated each year. (which this book isn't) The section about Television in New Zealand was outdated. This book makes it seem that even the best satellite service will not compare to even cable in the US. In other words, their television offerings are scarce. However, I found that to be untrue. Sky TV offers many channels and has good variety. This is just an example of how this book cannot possibly keep you informed about a rapidly changing country like New Zealand. The point is, if you really want the scoop on living in New Zealand, ask your friends who've visited for information. An even better way is to search on the internet. Go to a chatroom that has New Zealand inhabitants and ask them. They are very friendly."
3,too much spray,very surprised with a can of merlot that i used today. the can discharged way too much paint. usually you are able to slowly mist on light coats with alot of control. this nozzle put out so much paint all at once that even holding it 16 or so inches away you could hardly move fast enough to prevent runs. Ive never had this in all my years of using spray. went on way too thick for my taste. did end up with a beautiful gloss and color depth but very hard to controli would rather put on several thin coats. than one thick one. possibly just this can. ive never had this problem before.
5,wonderful product,This was a great product that arrived very fast and was exactly as described. Reliable and good paint. I have tried others and they work but not as good.
4,"Rad, Just Rad.","I was a bit skeptical about this idea when I first heard about it. An all DVD release with videos? Well, I do love music videos, but I also love listening to CDs on their own, but I then realized that these tracks can be burned onto your computer and then on a blank disc, so I get the music + the videos...nice.I saw The Sun play at the Troubador about 2 weeks ago and it was honestly one of the better shows I've been to this year. ""Justice"" sounded spectacular, as did ""Lost At Home"". I give thing 2 thumbs up!"
2,NO COLOR CONSIDERATION,"Even though there are several images in different colors of the same model, you will receive whatever color they feel like sending. It is tacky to spend money on a grey cover when the rest of your interior is tan."
5,Gooney Bird Greene is the BEST!!!!!!,"Gooney Bird Greene is the new student at Watertower Elementary. She arrived in October, after the first month of school had ended. She arrived, with a dictionary and a lunch box, and not even a mother to introduce her. And, she loves being smack dab in the middle of everything. Soon, the class is learning about writing. They need a main character. Gooney bird is a mysterious kid. The class decides to write about her. And, soon, she's telling fun and silly stories about her life all over the place!"
4,Creative Writing,"I use this book to help students think about writing creatively. Goonie is perfect at making everything absolutely true but sounds unbelievable. With all of testing taking place, it is nice to slow down and have students reflect about how they can write from a different perspective."
5,What an imaginagtive story!,"I recommended this book to my 5.5 year old goddaughter who is very bright and has a vocabulary way beyond her years. I also bought it for myself to read so that she and I could discuss it.Her daddy read it to her, but he said that it was a bit beyond the experiences of a 5 year old and though she loved the character, Lily had trouble identifying with some of what is going on in the classroom of a second grader when she is only in Kindergarten.I loved reading the story and found myself frequently laughing; however, I quickly began to understand what Lily's dad was saying. Much of the humor is reliant upon ""puns"" and having taught Kindergarten for years I should have realized that it would be a bit sophisticated for a 5 year old whose humor isn't quite there yet.For ages 7+ I think this would be a wonderful book to give for the coming holiday season."
3,"OK, not great.","I purchased this thinking it would be a clever story for bedtime, and there are elements about it that are clever, but the story as a whole just didn't mesh. It encourages people to consider statements from different angles, breaks the elements of storytelling down (albeit in a superficial manner, but this is a book for children, after all), and encourages children to tell their own stories, which is probably the best feature of the book. The characters are not well-developed, but that too may have been a device to spark creativity in children--why one child never says anything, and why another child is highly annoying may have been meant to get children thinking and telling their own versions of the story."
2,Can you tell,This book is perrty cool.Do you like it?This book is the world's best way to make a new book is it on tThis book is the world's best book.The first time in my life I have read a new book on my kindle fire.
5,Great to see a Lowry book for younger readers,"Talk about a versatile author! And laugh-out-loud funny, too. Teachers in grades 1-4 are going to love reading this one in classrooms. Gooney Bird is an endearing second-grader who has a lot of practical wisdom to dispense and is able to do it with verve and self-confidence (and while wearing a tutu!) Imagination really CAN change the tone of a classroom and this charming book will show everyone just how it does."
2,rocker mouse,i have limited use and the rocker mouse is wonderful to use unfortunaely they need to be perfected they seem to wear out fast. i find that the ball needs to be cleaned often and then it seems to get stuck and not move freely. i hope they can improve it the concept is a great idea easier on the hand more natural like shaking hands.
3,A gentle mediocrity,"I love the soothing voice of the Celtic harp, but this CD sells you short because of the noticable variences in sound quality throughout the different recordings. Some are really nice, while some are only fair. A couple are annoying. This is a nice collection of Celtic tunes, and makes for satisfying ""ambiance"" background music, but there are many other harp recordings out there that stand up much better to close scrutiny. Splurge for a different one..."
4,Very original and highly entertaining,"City Infernal is the first book I've read of this author, although I've heard his name mentioned many times among my horror friends. Believe me, I've slapped myself after the first few chapters as punishment for not reading him sooner. This book reads like lightning... which is great, but it's also it's weakness. Things happen too quickly near the end and some of the dialogue is a little stiff. But have no fear, the positive far outweighs the negative. This novel seems like it could easily become a trilogy or longer. Please, Mr. Lee, write a sequel!!!"
5,Backwards,"I actually read this book after Infernal Angel. I don't know why, but I am almost glad I did. Because I was interested in what happened to Cassie the first time around and I feel if I had read this first I would have been bored by the long recap in Infernal Angel. The city is awesome. It's gross and inventive. He really took the time to back up his world, I like that. I liked the character Cassie and kind of felt attached to her. I hope he writes more about the Mephistopolis in the future. Great book, I recommend to anyone who loves Lee, Horror, or has a fascination with Hell."
2,2 1/2 STAR REVIEW,"What started out as a fairly enjoyable read turned out to be a less than impressive one. Lee's pen is wicked; there's no doubt about that. His horror scenes are always nasty, which is a good thing when one seeks out that sort of thing. Just try to pick up his Creekers without cringing. Hardcore stuff. Yet, behind all the gross-outs and the violence is always a Lee with a purpose, a Lee with a story to tell. Which is exactly what lacks in CITY INFERNAL. What we get instead is just an amateurish take of hell where nothing really happens except when the heroine discovers yet another God-given gift that will help her on to next level in her search of her already dead missing sister. A sort of a Nintendo game with no winning gold or, in this case, no plot rewards. Yes, Lee's prose is still clear and fast and his action scenes are somewhat effective, but his vision of horror will need some retooling if his next delivery resembles anything like this lackluster one.-----Martin Boucher"
3,great read,What. Got me to purchase the book was the great excert or the free part you can read at the beginning. Just getting into it hope it's. Good will. Let. You know. That why only. 3 stars
4,A fun look at Hell,Not much I can say summary wise that hasn't been said...This was a very enjoyable book. The author keeps things moving along at a good pace and keeps you guessing about one character's true allegiances. I wouldn't say it's 'horror' but it definately is gruesome in it's description of the inhabitants of Hell. Lee's Hell is a very interesting place that could use more exploration.
1,Worst read ever!,"This has to be the worst book I've ever read. The plot was ridiculous, the characters shallow, and the writing a total mess. Any time the characters were in a jam they just conjured up something out of the blue with little explanation. A guy tries to kill Cassie and her father at their house, gets knocked out, and with no explanation wakes up the next day in his own house not remembering anything. I was really looking forward to it based on other reviews and the original concept. Unfortunately I had to struggle to finish it. I wrote a better story than this when I was in third grade. I'm actually thinking about publishing that garbage because if people will buy this junk they will buy anything. I wasn't shocked in the least by the book and now have to drink heavily to scrub the memory of it from my brain."
1,Dreadful,"The only book I have ever thrown away when I was done reading it. The plot is trite, character development shallow and rushed and way too many loose ends that just don't make sense.There were some interesting ideas in this book, but they were completely smothered by poor execution."
1,bad & stupid -- and not in a good way,"A silly story badly written with plot holes big enough to drive an ice cream truck through. One -dimensional characters and every last piece of exposition, and there is a lot of it, is explained to us through stilted chunks of dialogue that bring what puny little of a tale there is here to begin with to a grinding halt. Avoid at all cost."
4,Lee has a *hellish* imagination...,"This book was full of some of the most vivid imagery I've ever read...and what a nightmare he created. I was hooked from the beginning on the action, intrigue and gore, gore, gore. If you are easily offended or disgusted, this is not a book I'd recommend. It's definitely not for the faint of heart. However, if, like me, you love blood and guts (and lots of it!), you will be as pleased as I was. The descriptive writing and fantastic storyline will have you hooked."
3,Interesting description of hell,Fairly lame story but the effort on Lee's description of Hell made this a good read. He really put some thought into this. I found the book humorous and not in the least horrifying. The descriptions can increase the queasy factor though!
5,A Hidden Gem,"This was my first Edward Lee novel...I'd never even heard about him before and found him by cruising Amazon, and let me tell you, he IS AMAZING. Highly realistic story and authentic characters. I COULD NOT put this book down. I just ordered the rest of his books. This guy is the best kept secret in horror."
1,Trash,It continues to amaze me people continue to produce such trash. Let's not even talk about the people who watch it. Not worth a George or the amount of heat it would produce if burned.
4,Fairly Good Anodizing,"Being an owner of a plating shop and a chemical supplier (hobbyplating.com), I found this book very informative and a great ready for those already in the business. But it will not be an easy read for those not familiar with anodizing. There is alot of technical data that a lay-person will not understand. If you are already a professional anodizer or a plater, this book is a 'must have'. But if you are ignorant to the subject of anodizing, I would pass on this book."
3,Running out of steam....,"First, I'd give Revelation Space and Chasm City 5 stars. Both are masterpieces. This book retains some of the same brilliant energy and gnarly braininess, but just feels padded out toward the end. The ideas are there, the plot is good, but it could have had about 200 pages hacked out and been a far better book. Still a good read, but I think I'll lay off the Reynolds for awhile...I feel a little betrayed."
2,As The Universe Turns,The first half is interesting. The second half is written as if the author is being paid by the word.
3,Standard scifi pulp.,"I thought that the novel was an okay read but nothing special. No really unusual insights or ideas, just another scifi novel essentially."
5,...tears in my eyes dude...,"I just read Revelation Space(re-read), Chasm City, and now this book, all in the last 3 weeks. What an trip! I usually prefer fantasy-especially Gene Wolfe-but I have to say, this book was delightfuly and surprisingly ""human"" for a ""hard sci fi"" novel. Dont get me wrong. It has intricacies of plot and characterization and oogles and shmoogles of ""hard-science"" (you might actually learn something! wow!). But it is a work that I found very edifying to the soul on a spiritual level. This is a great series and I cannot wait to read Absolution Gap. I actually loved the ending. I recommend you read them in this order 1.Revelation Space 2.Chasm City 3.Redemption Ark 4.Absolution Gap.(Chasm City is a prelude and not part of the trilogy but this is the order that they were written in, and the order that you will find them most enjoyable.)"
5,If you like top notch Space Opera this is for you...,Redemption Ark is a 'can't put it down' read. Make sure that you have read both Revelation Space and Chasm City prior to this one to get the full effect.Reynolds writes with a breadth of story that compares to Iain Banks or Vernor Vinge in terms of pace and characters. The story line sucks you in and the only bad thing about this book is that is leaves you wanting more...right now.I guess I'll just have to wait for the next one.
5,What an amazing author,"Wow Reynolds has done it again. I got this book the first day it came out and have been reading it nonstop. There is nothing quite like his style. It is so vast and epic in scope. He keeps you guessing till the end and has a knack for creating totally believable worlds and technology. After reading Revelation Space I searched desperatly for more books with the same feel to them. I then bought Chasm City and was very pleased with it. Then this. It is almost too good to be true. If you like his other books you will love this, and to those who haven't read his other book I highly recommend this. Enjoy!"
4,I Really want to like this.....,"So, Alastair hits again. This (and its prequels) have some absolutely billiant bits. However...You can almost predict when the editor is going to hit. There are some real potboilers lurking in this series - they miss the novel and may hit the novellas.Forgetting the gaps this is the latest in a series of fascinating stories that answer ther Fermi Paradox (IE, if there is intelligent life in the universe why aren't the working at McDonald's?).Somewhat fascinating."
3,"Good writing, poor photos","This book is one of the few in English on Wu style taijiquan. It was written by Dr Wen Zee, who could speak and write English. In fact, he was my first major teacher in Southern Wu style--although I only knew him briefly before he died. In general I prefer the writing in this book to the photos. The pictures were, in my opinion, poorly done--having him wear white against a white/light background was not a wise decision; also sometimes he appears at somewhat odd angles instead of being vertical. If you are familiar with the Wu style Long Form then this book can be used to jog your memory--otherwise, don't attempt to learn from this."
3,Precurser of things to come,"After reading Le Carre's masterpiece ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"" i was looking for similar story. And fortunatley got this long forgotten book that was written before the high ranking CIA Director William Colby defected to KGB. A fast and well written thriller for all thos who are nostalgic about sixties background"
4,Ordinance pales in comparison to this Single,"Which seems to be the case with A lately. Hi-Fi Serious should've been at least 18 songs long with all the b sides they packed on the singles for Nothing, Starbucks and Something's Going On. Teen Dance Ordinance as a whole was slightly disappointing, however the single for Rush Song was home for much catchier post 'Monkey Kong' A tunes. Well worth the purch."
3,Spring Tention!!!,I purchased two of the Black Hole traps and they work very well. The only issue I have with them isThe spring tension is lacking in strength. When the trap is triggered and it captures the goffer it doesn't applyEnough pressure to kill them instantly and they sit in the trap and fight to get out of it until they either die of suffocation or I finish them off myself. I hate to see any animal suffer and for that reason I switched to the Black Box traps. They are similar in the way they work like the Black Hole. Except their spring rate is a lot stronger and do the job instantly. I personally would recommend the Black Box over the Black hole.Thanks for reading.
2,What are we doing wrong?,"We bought 2 of these after trying several other "" cinch traps"" to no avail. The moles are ruining the yard and are digging tunnels all over. After reading the reviews and being frustrated, we set these up ""end to end"" to get them coming in from both sides. After one night, both traps were still open, not activated, but the varmints had covered both of them with dirt. This is exactly what had happened when we set the cinch traps as well...placing them deep into the holes, covered with black plastic and a bucket to keep all light out. Traps sitting there, not activated but buried in soil. We even tried the poison peanuts, but seems like they are dining and dashing. WHAT ARE WE DOING WRONG? Have lost our sense of humor as well as money."
1,gopher trap,Does not function animals do not trip trap. Product cheaply made trap trip settings to stiff to trip when animal enters trap.
3,Average performance,I've tried various gopher traps and have limited success with each of them. I tried these hoping for increased results. The bad thing about these is the diameter of the size hole needed to put them in. I think if they reduced the diameter size by 30% they would be more effective. I've often found that I can't get them in the tunnels because the trap is so big. My success with these is about the same as other traps I've been using over the years.
3,Not Nelson's Greatest but Worth Reading,"I pretty much read anything by Antonya Nelson--and with great pleasure. She's one of this century's strongest, funniest and most original auhtors of family relations, and always a pleasure. Plus, her writing keeps getting better.This earlier novel, however, doesn't do her justice. The main character is hard to like, the prose meanders, and Nelson's point gets lost beneath her striving to make such a point."
4,"great read, good characters","Although I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, Ido find that the central character, Birdy Stone, is not always sympathetic, or even likable. This makes the book interesting, but it also makes some of Birdy's thought processes unappealing. However, despite her rampant insecurities, Birdy is not altogether unlovable. She is funny and irreverent. Jesus, too, is amusing, witty. Luziana, perhaps my favorite character, seems wise beyond her years, yet youthful as well. All around, the book is a worthwhile read. Its humor and its unique views of life in a small southwestern town make it enjoyable. Nelson's attention to detail, such as Mr. John's ever present khaki coveralls offer an authenticity that more than make up for Birdy's small shortcomings."
2,"alternative title: ""Nobody Cares...""","Antonya Nelson is a talented writer. Her words illicit emotional responses. Unfortunately by the end of this book my overall emotional response was ""who cares?"" A failing for me was Birdie's character arch - basically that there was none. Birdie is an unsympathetic character at the beginning of the book and even less sympathetic by the end. The actual murder mystery woven into the plot is anticlimatic. Either plot device (Birdie's ""growth"" or the murder's solution) needed to make a stronger impression. In general the book was great dissappointment."
3,Innovative handling of a who-dunnit,"Ms Nelson writes about a high school teacher but seems to want to avoid taking us into the classroom.Her writing is sometimes slightly abrasive, quirky, the main character unsympathetic, but the ideas are fun and inviting. Excellent plot, narrative thread."
5,In His Presence,"I originally purchased this book to use as a reference in a paper I was writing. However, I started reading it as a daily devotional which is how it is written. It takes discipline to read it that way because the temptation is to keep reading. It is quite well-written and provides very good insight on the Psalms. The importance of worhsip in our daily lives is a recurring theme throughout the book and important in order to enter into his presence. The thought for the day consistently speaks to worship of God. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to others."
2,"ABC's of violin, Book 1: Performance CD","I ordered this item thinking it comes with the Book 1 and CD, but I just got a CD with the recording of the pieces being played. Be forewarned that this does NOT come with the Beginner's Book 1, just the CD! Not very helpful without the book! I'm very disappointed."
5,So special,"A very sincere and thoughtful portrayal of a man's love of jazz. Chris's inner spirit of peace is felt as you experience his beautiful sounds. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A lover of good musicA very inspirational vignette that allows one to engage in the spirit of music. It allows you to just ""get away"" from in it all, sinking yourself into the musicality of life. Enjoyed the music throughout the film. RN"
3,Belkin WaveRest Gel Wrist Pad,"The Belkin WaveRest Gel Wrist Pad is a little cumbersome. Otherwise I recewived it very quickly, the price was right ."
2,Not as Pictured,"This appeared to be contoured in the photo, to shape to your palm/wrist. Mine isn't that way at all. It's basically bubbled on top, which is awkward for a rest and is too high up for me to actually use the mouse. It causes pain when I do try to use it. Also, it is not purple. It should be noted in the description and an updated photo should be used. I think it would make a good rest for use with a keyboard, if you have two of them, if you're typing at an upward angle."
2,Not so great...,"Lasts about a month. Mashes down in the middle and it can get a bit hard feeling in colder temps. When it is warm (e.g. the summer), it does OK.I haven't experienced the leaks as others have reported, but only been using it for a month."
1,There are better wrist pads on the market,I bought this as an extra support for my wrist and within 2 weeks the gel started to ooze from the seems. I ended up having to staple all around the edges of the bean to stop the ooze which has worked but definately a design flaw.I wouldn't buy this again.
2,Not a great buy...,Starting going 'flat' and seams coming apart in a very short space of time. Will not buy this brand again.
2,Skip This And Get Fellowes Gel Flex,"To be short it is crap. I got this and FELLOWES GEL FLEX Rest....Fellowes is the real deal with a good amount of gel. This, when I press it, it feels like an air filled piece of garbage, seriously. I don't know why I bought two wrist pads either, got shopping crazy. I'll probably keep this and use it at school, but it doesn't do much for my wrist pains. Just not cushiony enough.Get Fellowes, the gel pad and quality overall is significantly better. Just seems like they actually used gel and a decent amount of it.This is still usable, but if you have serious wrist pains and you use the pc a lot, skip this. Why buy something that barely helps you?"
4,nice little wrist rest,"IIt's a little harder than I expected, but not too hard. The texture of the cloth is soft enough that it doesn't irritate the skin. It stays put. Now, if I could only find one about 18 inches long to put in front of the keyboard."
5,Great wrist pad for me!,"I've been using the Belkin Gel Wrist pads for years. I bought 2 of them over 17 years ago and the second of those two was finally wearing out. I was so happy to find that they're still making the exact same ""model""! I like this size and style - it's a perfect fit for my wrist and the support it gives me is perfect. I find that I have difficulty when not using it. (Sometimes my Great Grandson hides it! LOL!) I've never had a problem with my 2 previous Belkin wrist pads leaking gel and so far no problems with this one either. It's very comfortable for me and I am so happy to find that Belkin still makes it. I highly recommend this wrist pad! :-)"
5,reduces my wrist pain.,"the picture is a bit deceiving, it looks purple, but i got a black one. I dont really care about the color, but for those who do, be careful...Other than that, it is amazing. I spend hours on the computer, playing alot of PC games so this helps my wrist pain. I can sit for hours and my wrist does not get sore. I got mine for 4.32, MONEY WELL SPENT"
3,A bit firm - moves around desk,"3/5 stars. Acts as it should, just isn't 'great'.It's hard to keep this item stationary on the desk. It doesn't rupture or anything, construction actually seems sturdy.The top padding is actually rather firm. The difference between resting your wrist on this or a mouse pad is quite negligible.No real problems, I guess it came as advertised. Just didn't wow me at all."
1,it is no good,"I bought it because I was hopping it will elevate my wrist but the problem is is too low, and it defeats the purpose."
3,Mediocre at best,"I bought two of these wrist rests to use with Apple Magic Trackpaads. Overall, the wrist rests perform as expected and provide support for my wrist when using the trackpad. However, rather than being completely filled with a gel material, they are filled with AIR! In the normal process of setting my wrist on the gel, the air slowly escaped and after only two weeks of use, the rests are not nearly as comfortable. Be weary of heavy use with these wrist rests because if you sit at a computer and expect to really rest your wrist on these, they won't hold up. I'm already looking for something different."
4,Decent wrist pad,"I've had this gel pad for over 5 years. I have not experienced any leakage in that time frame. I use it every work day for at least 6-12 hours a day at work, as I have for the past 5 years. It serves its function, I can't say that the gel works any better than those plain rubber ones with the built in mousepad however, so your mileage may vary and you might not want to risk having gel leaking out all over your desk."
3,Does what it's sopposed to do.,Simply this wrist pad is too way stiff for my tastes. Also it was a little smaller then what I am used too.
1,Wrong Item,"I was receiving this item, because the first time I purchased I received the wrong item color. The SAME wrong item was sent for the second time. I am supposed to do an exchange with amazon, but this is ridiculous, and a waste of time. Now I have to mail back the second wrong item."
2,Smelly,"I do like the face that this thing has a smooth fabric on top where my wrist can slide around on it. What I really don't like is that it smells. It smells like some sort of petroleum-based product, like oil and melted rubber. And after using it for a little bit, wrist smells like that, too. I wanted to use the wrist pad for comfort, but it's not comfortable to use when it stinks."
1,Too difficult!!!,This video was more for a person looking for choreography!! Not an excercise video in my opinion. Definitely a 'dance' video!!
2,First strike misses on a technicality.,"As a fan of the Carrier series, I found the book to have a great storyline. Non-stop action in the Douglass tradition. However, the abundant errors in context, tense, and spelling ruin an otherwise great read. Better editing is in order if the series is to continue."
3,"Varying action, poor editing","Have taken a break from the Carrier series, and finally picked back up again with Book 19: First Strike. The storyline of renegade Russians, and stolen WMD's is one thats been used, but it makes for interesting reading. Think this book could have been longer, but as usual, they wrap it up too fast. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the sub scenes are great, and a nice addition. Editing errors fill the book again, especially in terms of times listed at the beginning of each scene. Given this and some missing characters or discrepancies from previous books, 3 stars is all I can muster."
