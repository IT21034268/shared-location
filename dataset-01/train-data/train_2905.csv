2,Neurosis And nausea,"The acting is over-wrought and the pretentious nature of this neurotic dancer story creates an atmosphere of dread and nausea.Special effects are used to accentuate her dementia. ..Natalie Portman And Barbara Hershey do a theatrical job wringing their hands, in a disturbed mother daughter love hate frenzy.Here you have the cliched mom ""didn't get to be a star"" hateful stage mother,and the bulimic possessed anorexic daughter.The end is predictable and sensational.What happened to the days of understatement?Who will die for art?. It's all been said before. The movie is OK,but just OK,and not something to look at twice.It doesn't live up to its art house film aspirations.If you don't enjoy eating disorders and self mutilation leave this one on the shelf.The acting is good,but the viewer has to decide if the movie is."
5,Bipolar viewers!,"You will either love it or hate it!This movie is very intense (to me). I didn't even realize I had been watching for more than one hour until it was done. There is no breather in the movie. Everything is closely tied together. The protagonist lives in a distorted world, where reality changes and black and white intertwine. I love the change of angle as it imitates the change of her mood. She is uncertain of herself. Her talent surfaces when the uninhibited side of her dominates. The distorted view of the world reminds me of schizophrenic patients. The struggle inside of her is dynamic. It changes rapidly as if she is a rapid cycler.I know some of my friends will hate it. This is not an action movie nor a comedy. It is one of those philosophical movie."
4,blach swan,one of the better films i saw in a long time and can see why natalie portman won an oscer.she was excellent in this movie and as well as the supporting cast.you definetely have to check this one out really great film.
4,"Great Movie, Poor Matting","I generally agree with the positive reviews I have read.There is ambiguity in the movie which many viewers were uncomfortable with. For me the ambiguity worked, after all we are seeing the movie through the eyes of a young woman who is unprepared for the world she finds herself in and who is increasingly unable to distinguish between what is real and what is not.The problem I have with the movie is the Matting - it is too course and extreme. It continually pulled me out of the movie. Maybe if I had a larger TV (presently a 32"" 1080P LCD) or swithed to a standard DVD, the picture would be more mat and less course grain.Other than the matting, I loved the movie and Natalie Portman's performance. None of the other reviews which I have read have mentioned a similar problem with the extreme matting. Am I alone?"
4,"Well done, but there is a touch of horror in this movie","Not a movie for anyone who can't handle a touch of horror. My wife had to turn her head several times. I enjoyed it for the most part, but felt there were some scenes that were unnecessary."
2,Melodrama at its Finest,"melodramanoun1. a dramatic form that does not observe the laws of cause and effect and that exaggerates emotion and emphasizes plot or action at the expense of characterization.Unfortunately, I use the term pejoratively.With a main character so relentlessly pathetic, meek and neurotic, I found my sympathy quickly transitioning to frustration and then boredom. What little psychological tension existed by the film's end was extinguished when subtlety was abandoned and the symbolism become grotesque, absurd and ultimately, silly.But then again, I did get to see Natalie Portman in a most satisfyingly intimate fashion, so, it wasn't all bad."
2,Tight Club,"Every girl wants to be a ballerina. Yeesh.This is the female version of The Wrestler, another Darren Aronofsky story arc of love, hate and masochistic self destruction.Yawn.Just as they hand out 3D glasses to watch Avatar, Zoloft should be mandatory for every Aronofsky screening. It's a downer, but knowing that from the get-go, there's little to interest besides the sex scene. The acting is good, but Mila Kunis is the real gem here. I said it after Closer and I still believe it today - Natalie Portman is not much of an actress. She peaked with The Professional. She has a cute face, but carries no dramatic weight. Isn't that what we have Sandra Bullock for?Here would be a twist for Aronofsky, recast the Natalie Portman role with Mickey Rourke. Now we got something interesting going.""First rule of Ballerina Club IS, you do not talk about Ballerina Club!"""
5,Aronofsky does it again,"This movie blew me away! Just like the wrestler it was a gritty look at the underbelly of a misunderstood art form, in this case, ballet. I'll be the first to admit that a ballet movie is not the first thing i'd usually throw in to the blu ray player, but Black Swan was a film I was more then happy to do so. I'm a huge fan of Darren Aronofsky, I love every single one of his movies, this one takes they cake. it's dark, psycotic, and sexual. If you're looking for a family film then throw this out, but if you want an edge of your seat, psycho-sexual thriller, then give this a try.Justin"
5,Holds up well to a repeat viewing,"While I haven't seen this since it was in the theaters, it holds up well on a repeat viewing. Still enthralling, and I was able to pick up on moments I only glimpsed during the initial run. Worth checking out a second or third time."
5,Awesome movie,"This movie is sexy, scary, sad and mysterious; in a word brilliant. Haunting and highly entertaining. Resonates for days!! You'll want to see it again and again."
1,Don't Bother,"Slow, boring and a waste of time watching. I can't believe the hype on this movie. Watching the news would have been more entertaining."
3,Not good,After hearing how great this movie was I was very disappointed! Don't waste your money or time with this one.
3,I was disappointed,For some reason I thought this movie was about something else than it was. I was a bit disappointed in this. It has a lot of lesbian sexual incidents in it. Just a strange movie overall.
3,Not as good as hoped.,"I wanted to see this for a while. So, I broke down and rented it in HD.I was unimpressed with some of the CGI stuff. I really didn't expect such gimmickry. I think it would have been a stronger story with that stuff done in a less technical way. Like, how ""special effects"" were done in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. So, it's 3 stars from me."
3,Two reviews in one,"I hated it, so a one star. My wife loved it, a five star. So I'll give it a three."
1,Gloomy!!!,Very disapointed in this movie. Was very hard to sit through. Certainly would not watch it a 2nd time. The sexual content ruined this movie and limits the people you can share it with. We cannot add this to our movie collection and will toss it into the trash can.
2,THIS was nominated for a oscar?,"Wish Amazon still had the rating bar available, don't really want to waste more time on this than I already have."
1,"REALLY,REALLY BAD!!!",I WAS CONFUSED FROM BEGINNING TO END!! I FELT LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY HAVING TO PAY TO SIT AND WATCH THIS.NATALIE PORTMAN WAS GREAT BUT WHAT A MESS OF A MOVIE.
1,awful,"If I could, I'd give this movie less than one star. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The combinaton of blatant sex and violence just put me off. Yes I'm an older female person. But my husband and my brother didn't even sit through till the end. I hadn't read any reviews before I purchased the movie which I wanted because the actress got the Academy Award for acting. Next time I'll be more careful."
1,Awful,"The acting may have been good, but this has to be the most disturbing, awful movie I have ever seen. I feel horrible having seen it. So glad I didn't pay movie theater price to see it. I actually had to turn away at times from the awful things happening on screen as I watched this young woman disintegrate into mental illness. It was like watching a train wreck about to happen. I wish I could rewind my mind back a couple of hours and forget I ever watched it."
1,This is art? cinema?,"This has got to be one of the most adolescent, anti-art movies ever produced. Just think of all the money wasted on this bit of tripe! Why do I say this? Because it is hardly more than standard TV movie fare, with Oprah like interjections of pop psychology/sex therapy...give me a break! Why would anyone want to insult the audience with this loathing, slumming movie? This is almost on the level of an afternoon middle school movie with a bit of lasciviousness thrown in to get the voyeurs to sit down and watch. Do not waste your money on it! If I could give it zero stars I would. Why any actor would find this story attractive is beyond me."
3,Decent deal for the price!,"I received the DVD very quickly, within a day or two of ordering! The price was very reasonable, however, the DVD did have one small section that was damaged and skipped when I played it. It wasn't enough to make me return it, but other than that I'd say service and quality are both good for the price paid."
4,Different Yet Good,"I think this movie is one of the strangest I've ever seen, however, it is a pretty good movie. I allows the audience to really think about what is happening and discover their own versions of the movie. Everyone should at least give it a try."
1,Dark & Depressing,"This movie makes NO sense. An incomplete story, very frustrating to sit through all the agony and despair for nothing! I am amazed that ANYONE liked this movie. I am just thankful that I didn't see it in the theater...what a waste of time and money that would have been."
1,What was that?,"Seriously, what was that? I felt this movie was more an Opera than a descent into madness, and it was so reserved and suggestive that I felt unsatisfied in more ways than one. When I see a film I want to either escape reality and enter a world I'll never reach or see a side so dark and real that is strikes paraboles within my soul. However Black Swan delivered on none of these. This film was so concentrated on the actual Ballet that the story never delivered, it just kind of whimpered out like the last slow breath of a dying rat. Unfortunately this should have delivered on what I beleive should be a new Academy Award Category: Most Overhyped Letdown Film of the Year. I would have rather listened to Natalie Portman deliver those android like lines from Star Wars than have to endure this promotion for mind manure once more. Thank you again for pushing me toward writing a real script Aronofsky, I am one bad movie closer to being compelled toward writing something Oscar Worthy."
1,"God, this movie sucked!!!","This godawful movie gave credence to the old saying, ""If the critics like it, DO NOT go see it 'cause it will most likely suck."" How true. This was one of the stupidest, worst movies that I have ever endured. The only good thing is that I only paid 99 cents for the rental; had I paid full price at the movies, I would've been REALLY mad.How in the world did anyone consider this dog to be Oscar worthy???"
3,Entertaining but okay,"In `Black Swan' Darren Aronofsky depicts the pain a ballerina has to endure to successfully rise to the top of the profession, a similar theme which he had explored earlier in the film ` The Wrestler', this includes little food consumption, lot of body aches and of course sometimes bleeding toenails. Natalie Portman is the ballet dancer who is selected by the director as she embodies the character of the white swan that is innocence but he wants her to play the role of the black swan as well, of deception and intrigue. As she channels her psyche for the black swan, Portman finds that the black swan is taking over her entire persona. Acting by all the leads and supporting cast members was exemplary, Natalie Portman is truly a great actress and Mila Kunis is a revelation. Winona Ryder is surprisingly in form. The movie gathered so many accolades but I found it enjoyable but not great. Three stars. 3/30/2011"
5,Intensely powerful,"The Bottom Line:A lacerating, sometimes hard-to-watch meditation on art and the artist, Black Swan is one of the most unsettling movies to gain a Best Picture nomination in some time and certainly one of the most deserving: well-acted (especially by the hit-or-miss Portman), with astonishing cinematography and masterful direction, Black Swan might be slightly below the bar Aronofky set for himself with Requiem for a Dream, but it's a modern masterpiece.4/4"
1,"Confusing, Cliched - Don't waste your money","I was excited about seeing this film and wanted to like it given the hype but was bored after 45 minutes. Had my husband not also been watching it, I would've fast forwarded through most of the scenes. The back and forth of reality and fantasy for ""artistic"" reasons was confusing and annoying. Characters were cliches - stage mom, tortured ballerina, obsessed, driven director with gratuitous lesbian and masturbation scenes thrown in. I couldn't wait for Natalie Portman to throw herself off the stage."
2,The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage,"Nobody in this movie IS NORMAL. Portman's character is insane at the VERY least, Nina's mother is WAY over-obsessed with her child...in fact she EVEN undresses her. Her mother gave up her career as a ballerina to have Nina. It appears she is trying to live through Nina and is always smothering her. The people in Nina's life are WAY too creepy and just freaking weird. This whole damn movie felt as if I were drunk. Weird, creepy hallucinations are fun for a short while but done so much you have no idea what's real and what's not. I understand what the writers of this movie were trying to say, but me personally I don't want to view things from a psychotic dancer point of view. What's the deal with porno-type content? Seriously. Do NOT buy this movie, unless you LIKE crazy. Personally, this movie was way TOO hyped up and just doesn't come close to expectations.So from my perspective this gets a 2 out of 5 stars."
3,Black swan,Black swan. Iended up with lots of questions. I didn't get the plot of the movie. It was too dark for me.
4,Is not scary,"I've seen some reviews that make this sound like a really intense movie- maybe in the theater, but not so much at my house. That said, it was good, it held my attention, and the dancing was beautiful."
2,Not impressed,"After reading good reviews of this film, I was expecting much more. I was left unfulfilled after watching. It could have been much better with better script writing. Overuse of gimmicks ruined it."
2,Black Buzzard,"After watching this movie, I was left with the feeling that something was missing. I thought some of the language was used for shock value, which did not enhance the movie at all. I was very disappointed with the Black Swan. I am not sure what I expected but it wasn't this. Other Portman movies were much better than the Black Swan. I do not understand what all the commotion was surrounding this movie. I know the premise of the movie was Nina's obsession with the part of the Black Swan in the dance. Perhaps there was another subliminal message that I didn't get."
1,Showgirls meets Carrie meets Staying Alive,"If you've seen the three films in the title of this review (and they are all better films than Black Swan BTW) then you've seen Black Swan. So we remove points for originality right off the top. Deduct more points for pervasive and corny CGI effects (want to see excellent use of CGI? See Gaspar Noe's Irreversible). More points removed for the underwhelming acting by Natalie Portman. Uggh... the Academy rarely gets best actress right and this year is no exception. We'll also deduct points for Hollywood's liberal (pun intended) use of female masturbation, girl on girl, instructor on girl, girl on... well you get the idea. All in all we've got no points left to deduct and so much more bad movie to cover. So we'll leave it at that. Darren Aronofsky had made two great films... Requiem for a Dream and the Wrestler. But this is not a great film. It's not even a good film. It's an over the top and convoluted mess. Hell even the ending was bad."
1,don't bother,"Horrible movie - would have given it zero stars if that was possible - unrealistic, stupid, poorly conceived, poorly executed"
2,Don't bother,This was a very dark movie and I most certainly did not like the ending. The first half of the movie was okay but then it takes a very weird turn.
1,zzzzzz,"Just another boring flick, seen this many times before , just different actors, places. Nothing new here. Save your money!"
2,Dark and Disturbing,"Looked forward to watching this movie after all of the awards and hype it received, but I found this movie to be very dark and disturbing rather than entertaining. I would not waste my time watching it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a couple of hours of entertainment. Of course, I have no problem with AMAZON...I order all the time, and my orders are always received timely and in good condition. It is the movie itself that I am giving a 2 star rating!"
5,Great but needs more Mila!,I loved this movie. Portman is excellent. My only wish is that there was more Mila Kunis. Mila does play a large role and is extremely sexy therefore there should have been more scenes with her. overall I would highly recommend this film.
5,very intense,"this is a very good movie, be advised it is intense. If you're aware of that and ready for it. It's fantastic!"
2,Not good !!,"I think knowing she did none of the dancing ruined it . I just kept waiting for somthing 2 really happen and then when it finally ,it just ended . also the look on her face thoughout the entire movie drove me CRAZY !!!"
2,Not that great.,Felt like the movie was hugely contrived and had heaping doses of hyperbole. Glad I only paid the rental price.
2,Not right for Natalie,"I really like this actress Natalie Portman, but the script was hopeless! No one could have made this movie believable!!"
1,makes my all-time worst movie list,"In the interest of full disclosure I turned this move off about 3/4s through. I was expecting a thriller and got instead a movie about an extremely insecure ballerina, an obsessive controlling mother, a manipulative ""friend"" and more catty ballerinas than anymovie desrves to feature. I kept waiting for it all to lead to something resembling a thriller but it never came close. Making it worse, it's one of those movies that asks the viewer to suspend credulity and believe that the characters simply accept ludicrous happenings without question. This is one heck of a pretentious film hiding behind an ""artistic"" veil."
1,so overrated.,"Oh, how I wish I could have the two hours back I spent watching this movie.. and rewatched Shrek, Up, or The Seventh Seal instead."
4,Great for Natlie Portman,She gave a great performance. You could tell that she put all she had into the role.I was very surprized with the ending.
2,Kind of Scary,Not that good. Confirmed that I don't find NP that good an actress. Story and plot a little scary and not in a good way.
3,Overrated,"Natalie Portman is excellent, but the plot is somewhat disjointed and unoriginal. Worth watching - but not worth an oscar nomination."
2,Not worth the time,Just a dull movie. The only reason I watched the whole thing is because my wife wanted to. Next time I'm just going to bed
2,Not my kind of movie,This is a chick flick and I didn't think a very good one. I can usually tolerate chick flicks but this one was hard. Entertainment was not there for me.
2,Boring,Surprised that this got so much critical acclaim. It was a struggle to keep watching it. Could not identify with any of the pathetic characters.
2,For the effete only,"A disturbing trip through the bizarre world of an aspiring dancer. If you are into the depressing aspects of art, this movie is for you."
4,Black Swan,"For people that want a movie that keeps you ""suspended"" all the way into it! It starts out slowly but then, it takes a ""leap of faith"""
4,Quirky Movie,This movie was totally not what I expected. Very pleasant surprize. Loved it and would highly recommend it to anybody.
3,"Well done, but Bizarre","This is really a psychological movie that takes one into the thinking of someone whose thinking is not aligned with reality. The problem is that the movie actually jumps right into that without the viewer really knowing what is going on, so what you think is happenning is not exactly right. Its quite well done, but disturbing, and I'm a psychologist. I'm also amazed that its rating is R - I must be out of touch with the rating systems, but there is a sex scene that I would say would be far too explicit for an underage child to watch (and lots of people let their under 17 kids watch R rated movies), so viewers beware, and pre-screen if your kids are going to watch it. Again, this movie is a well done, but its the kind of thing that can haunt you for a while if you spend some time thinking about it"
3,Aronofsky's latest is a visually stunning (lightweight) masterpiece of psychological horror,"Darren Aronofsky's latest tells the story of a troubled young dancer. Withdrawn and focused on perfection, she channels in her tiny, muscled body the ambition and resentment of her overbearing mother. Natalie Portman gives a stunning performance as Nina, who's won the role of the Swan Queen in an ambitious adaptation of Tchakovsky's Swan Lake ballet. She begins to break down under the strain of a demanding choreographer, who insists she be more passionate, and a controlling mother who wishes her to remain a biddable child. I never expected a story about ballerinas could be so viscerally intense - at once moving and horrific. It's a small, simple film that aims to do just what good psychological horror does, to affect the viewer, to disorient and frighten. Worked for me."
3,"Love the ballet, plot is over the top",Too much drama. Uncomfortable to watch because it's so over the top at times. And was Natalie Portman really that great? I don't know.
2,Horrible,"this movie is horrible. it confused me from start to finish the only good thing i can say in this movie is Natalie portman's performance. She was great, everything else sucked. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't."
1,The black Swan,"This was not the best of movies, was not described to meas it really was.Not a good review for Natalie Portman. She does not fit fora role like this.. Not recommended . Will see other bettermovies with her in it......"
2,"Two stars for Aronofsky's brass, sadly and wildly ill-advised.","If this misbegotten project had delivered on any level it might be worth a second viewing. If you enjoy dance, those sequences are truncated to the extent that they resemble 'Chicago the Movie.' Drama? Settle for histrionics and steaming melodrama. Sadly that's about it. A worthy cast delivered exactly what the director dictated. While critics genuflected, sophisticated audiences have viewed, rejected, and refused to recommend Black Swan to friends.That the 'Oscars' is an entertaining evening of froth is a given; still, encouraging an imitation of this load of dung by awarding Black Swan, in any category, would be ... well ... I would have to swoon."
3,BUNUEL meets POLANSKI maybe POWELL?,"OSCAR TO PORTMAN, OSCAR TO KUNIS [SUPPORTING]ACTUAL WINNERS - HERSHEY AND RYDER~ BOTH WOMEN DESERVE LEADING ROLES?NOTHING - REPEAT - NOTHING ORIGINAL HERE - IT'S ""REPULSION"" meets Bunuel .... Deneuve and those nail clippers ....""RED SHOES"" - Moira Whatsisname? The ""Othello"" takeoff with Ron Coleman ...... Good Gawd People ...git some sense into them thar ditsy critic heads - no doubt the ""studios"" will heavily back this one ..... err, since 'Tis ""Aweful about Eve""?A touch of Fosse too?ENJOY THIS EUROTRASH SMUT .... YEARN FOR SOMETHING ORIGINAL ......For real kicks slam Hersey, Ryder, Portman and Kunis in a mod-psyched version of Chekov's ""Three Sisters"" - about 3 21st century women dying to GET OUT of modern-day Moskow. Now THAT's original. And something that ccould push me back behind the camera......"
1,No Swans in this movie,"Black Swan consisted of mental and physical mutilation scenes, theft, self-loathing, drugs, drinking, vomiting, long self-pleasure, male/female and female/female sex scenes, perverted old men touching themselves and the lead actress. Verbal and mental abuse, murder and suicide, and a sickly looking lead actress crying most of the time while supposedly portraying a ballet dancer who was picked for the lead part in Swan Lake. It was monumentally disturbing on so many levels and ruined a nice evening."
1,stab out your eyes,"If you want to see a good Aronofsky film, try ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""pi.""Black Swan was total crap. All those tight claustrophobic shots, and the underlying message that anyone who competes to do something well is of course an obsessive compulsive nut case. And of course ""sex"" is the only hermeneutic of ""liberty"" or freedom. Utter garbage.And as Aronofsky has said ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"" are companion pieces, let me make an observation and follow up with a suggestion.Mr. Aronofsky In all your films, death is the ultimate definitive answer for perseverance and excellence of extraordinary competitive people (Pi, The Wrestler, Black Swan....dead dead dead....).Okay....so if you are making *excellent* films, why aren't you dead already?After making your next film, please arrange to be dead. Otherwise, you are a hypocrite."
1,Hated it!,I couldn't get through the first 30 minutes of this movie and I only watched it because of Natalie Portman....
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Horrible movie, not worth the rental fee. After seeing the movie there is no way that Natalie Portman did all of her own dancing or even 95% of the dancing. Weird and disconnected glad I didn't waste the money and see it when it was still in the theater."
1,not knowing that it was totally a musical wannabe film,this movie is the oposite of what many people expect when they buy iti suggest renting it first before trowing away your money
2,Unengaging,"This is a peculiar movie about a morbidly thin young woman whose bulemia apparently drives her insane so she begins hallucinating. She lives with her domineering mother and worries about a big promotion coming up at work -- will she get it? Her boss says she has some of the qualifications but not all of them. She rushes to the toilet and sticks her finger down her throat and later he says okay, he'll give her a chance. About this time she starts worrying about a co-worker who wants the same job. Is everything going to hell in a handcart all around her, or is she just imagining it because she's not eating anything? Who knows? Who cares? I'd add that she looks perpetually constipated but I don't think that goes with bulemia so maybe it's something else. The music was nice but is even better on CD, without the annoyance of constant interruptions by portentous dialogue and half-assed plot devices."
1,Really?! Have you never seen a ballet or a good movie?,"Ok, I love ballet, I love movies but can someone tell me what the hell this was? If I wasn't cringing I was staring in absolute horror.Do yourself a favor and spend the money on any version of Swan Lake that Amazon offers or spend it on any Hitchcock movie. Thiswas strictly low rent."
4,Excellent but not perfect,"I'm a college instructor for beginning level Architecture Appreciation, and the Leland Roth book is an excellent choice to use for such a class. It is concise, informative and for the students, easy to read. Also, for their purposes, because the book is mostly black and white, it is rather cost efficient in an age of over-priced rip-off textbooks. The only problem with the book is that it can really stand to be updated. There is no chapter about Decontructivism or anything that followed, and the book ends with Mario Botta in 1993, which these days is antiquity already. Roth must know that his book is a gold standard for such a class. Knowing this, it is imperative that he revise it soon. it's too good of a product to stop 12 years ago."
5,Excellent & timely service.,"Timely service, excellent price (can you beat it?).The item fit right into my phone, charged properly, and I've been using it for about a month w/o any problems."
1,will not hold charge,"My ""new"" battery holds a charge for two days then it is dead.Amazon should not sell this product."
5,A Battery of uses.,"Okay: My cellphone is getting old and the battery that came with it was dying slowly, like the tenor does in an Opera. I looked all over the place and couldn't find a replacement, again because my cellphone is made of clay and animal skins; it's that old! Finally, I decided to try Amazon, largely because they have stuff; lotsa' stuff and old stuff as well.Huzzah! Not only did they have the juice can (battery) I needed, it was cheap, as in ""we're clearing the shelves of this junk, let's see if anyone will buy it"". It was less than five dollars, probably only twice what it cost to make it.End of story: My cell phone battery is now running like a champ (unlike me) and will last long enough to get out of the dratted contract I made with the carrier. In short: Amazon came through when nobody else would, and the battery is...well, a battery- a new battery, a good one...What else can I say? I'm happy!"
1,Seller sent me a dead battery. What a rip off!,"I received the battery, charged it up and it went dead after a day. I recharged it but the charge wouldn't ""take"" this time. The battery is completely useless to me. I'm not happy."
1,Batteris last 2 months!!,"I was very happy with these batteries for the first week! Seemed to good to be true!! It was! Within a few weeks the batteries quickly started losing their charge, and after 2 months barely last for 24 hours before needing a recharge. I can't believe these batteries were new when I bought them, and suspect they were refurbished....."
3,Cell Phone Battery,"This battery started out working great, but now, after about a year and a half, the power doesn't last very long at all. Of course the problem could be I plugged it up before all the power went down on the phone."
1,piece of junk,"I agree with others, charged battery over night, put in, lasted 3 hours.Thought maybe it hadn't charged, recharged, same thing all over. I'm requestinga refund. Don't waste your time."
2,Battery life is not long,"This battery is a joke. At full charge, almost no calls and it only last around 2 days.I remember the original battery would last 3 to 4 days easy."
2,You get what you pay for. Tasco 12 x 25 folding portables.,"Well, I received these as a promotional gift. They sell for 14.00. What do you get? You get a view that gives you a little magnification and very little light. If you have nothing else, they make the view from the 27th floor of my office overlooking the West Side of Manhattan and the Hudson a little more interesting. Buy something else with your own money."
3,Takes a little getting used to,The cutting edge was far less sharp than I was expecting so I had to dig down into the pith to make lemon curls for martinis. I think Williams-Sonoma may carry a peeler with a sharper edge -- I've used it at a friend's house and it was more conducive to peeling just the top layer of the lemon.
2,Disappointing follow-up,"I'm a big fan of Jepp's first album, but this one doesn't really do it for me. It sounds like she decided to crank up the country rawk element, complete with more radio-friendly choruses and more obvious hooks. In doing so, to my ear, she's lost some of the bruised and complex charm of her debut.However, she's still an intriguing artist: A voice that could strip paint but, at times, can caresses. ""Lucky Stars"" is a charming song... However, I rate her first album well above this."
2,Very small and difficult to activate,"Other reviewers have mentioned how small these are. I have nobody to blame but myself for that, but one thing I didn't think about is that the smallness of the package also means they don't have enough material inside to stay cold for very long - maybe 5 minutes max.On top of that, about a third of them so far are absolutely impossible to activate. The inner package simply will not burst. So far, I've thrown away three out of the nine I've tried. And I've got a pretty good grip.Next time, I'll try a different size/brand."
3,fine,"The cold packs work well, but you must store it in a hard case so they won't accidentally get activated before you need them. Great addition to any First Aid kit."
4,"Not bad, but not REAL Ice...","My shoulder and elbow is always sore as i play racquetball many nights per week...These bags really help, however, there is a difference between real ice and these...subtle , but there....Would still buy these again, though---they are great 'on the road""...."
2,Works great... for 5 minutes...,"Got my ice packs today, and was eager to try one out. My first impression was good, it was hard to break the internal pouch, but as soon as I popped it the pack became very cold almost instantly. The pack stayed very cold for about 5 minutes, and then warmed up fairly quick. After about 10 minutes it was almost back to room temperature. I tried a second one and it lasted a little bit longer. I noticed it starting to warm up about 9 minutes in, and was pretty warm after about 15 minutes.The nice thing is that I have 24 of them, so I guess I can just keep using them one after another..."
3,Derby Injuries,I bought these ice packs for our roller derby team to use for the ever occuring minor injuries. These are quick and easy to use! Great product!
2,iCE PACKS,"these packs are cold for a very short time, less than 15 minutes. I would have been better off buying the larger ones as they stay cold much longer, now I have 3 cases of these. I use for them for headaches but these won't do me much good"
3,Ok. Small and lasts 5 minutes.,Smaller than I expected. Next time will read dimension more closely. Lasted 5 minutes. Ordered for first aid kit. Will look for a larger size next time.
2,"Most work, but some dont...","Most work as should, but 2 of the six that I have used so far have not worked. These two were so difficult to use, I could not activiate at the time they were needed. I actually had to go home and put them in a vise to pop the inner bag to activate the cold pack. The others have worked as designed, but I hate to worry about weather the one I have with me will work or not. These do not give me confidence or peace of mind that I would expect from something in my first aid pack."
5,Wish I had this book with my first child!,This book is a great way to learn sign language and teach your babies/kids. My now 20 month old is able to tell me what she needs and there is much less frustration in the house than I had with my first child at this age. My 4 1/2 year old and my 20 month old can communicate with each other as well through signs. I love this book and it has started me on a path of learning/teaching more signs. You can't go wrong with it - even if you only use one sign from it (you don't have to remember them all to have your life easier by using signs).
2,Meh,There are only about 10 signs. They spent too much time explaining what is obvious instead of filling space with useful info.
1,waste of money,"So incredibly basic that it was not what I thought it would be when reading the blurb. Absolutely ridiculous. Do not download it. Amazon Kindle, shame on you."
3,Overall they are just OK,"The traps do OK, but over a few sets the mesh breaks and it needs to be fixed. The latches that are supposed to hold the trap in the closed position are terrible. I have to use Zip Ties to accomplish this."
4,Classic Fun!,"Do you like classic arcade games?If so then I advise that you buy this right now.Even more games than the first Taito Legends and just as equally fun!This is a great value for so many classic games.The only downside is the presentation of the games compared to the first collection but that does not hurt the games themselves.So if you want some old school fun without the history lesson, then I highly recommend this!There are some great classic gems here including the awsome shooters, Darius Alpha and Darius Gaiden!"
2,Too tough,"Even though you've usually got an unlimited amount of quarters, the games are just too tough. It's a good thing it's a home game, otherwise I'd lose $3.00 a minute in the arcades. There was only one game I had heard of before on thid disk of 35 games: Qix. I don't think many of these made it to the US, probably because of the difficulty."
5,Wow!!! 39 Taito arcade classics on one PS2 disc!!! Hours of fun!!!,"Wow!!! what a great deal!!! This awesome collection includes 39 Taito arcade classics for your PS2!!! Hours of fun for the whole family!!! Something for everyone!!! It's just plain awesome!!! I just love these compilations that give you multiple classics on one disc,there a great deal for the money!!! And loads of replay value!!!This one is on par with the first Taito Legends collection!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way up!!! A+"
5,the games of Taito Legends 2,"Some of the games on this game anthology are a blast. My favorites so far are Syvalion, Cameltry and Raimais. There appears to be something in here for everyone as it contains a wide variety of games made by Taito from 1979 to 1997. I haven't even played them all and already I'm having a blast. There's a maze/shooter in which you control a robot dragon to eliminate outer space enemies. There's a marble maze type of game. There's a maze game that plays like a Pac-Man and Dodge'em hybrid. There's a game that combines the elements of Gauntlet style mazes with the side scrolling brawling elements found in Double Dragon. There's also a weird side scroller in which you play a monk who throws beads at enemies. There's also a bunch more but these are what I thought of off the top of my head."
5,Great collection of old school games!,This is a great collection of old school games!The only complaint I have is the load time when going between the game selection menu and playing a game.
2,outsourced,"Okay jokes. I would recommmend watching the you tube videos of RP. His performances there are off the hook. Outsourced is more for the world audience. RP strength is his jokes about Indians, and a few other groups. Watched it once but was not captivated. However I still watch the you tube videos. I felt happy to support RP, but he's doing fine. Would skip this video until a more indian centric movie is released. Overall RP makes me laugh but this video is not comparable to the you tube clips."
2,not good as expected - dissapointment,"The guy was a total dissapointment. He went on a rampage making bad jokes about all minority races (balcks, brown, asians, etc) but then went on telling protective and polite jokes about white people.Definitely he was targeting the white audience for his DVD release.His brand sketch ""somebody's gonna get hurt"" was very lame and short,only about 30 second at the very endConsidering that this is a great comedian, and that he's done very well, this DVD was by far a waste of money, not"
5,Great Product and Service,I got the product exactly in the time that it was suppose to arrive and have enjoyed it ever since. Great seller
2,Bill Hicks would blow this guy off the stage,"Russell Peters is a one trick pony. All his material revolves around race. This would be fine if he had something profound or enlightening to say on the subject, but he rarely does. He takes the easy way out. If 75 minutes of nothing but stereotyping, mimicry, and outright racist put downs delivered by a smug, unappealing jerk is what you are seeking, then you will not be disappointed.RP definitely needs to broaden his repertoire or his act is gonna get old real fast."
3,It's ok but certainly not his best work,It's a good dvd but I enjoyed a lot more all his performances that you can find on you tube.
3,"I hate to give Russell Peters such a low starting score, but...","For starters, I would definitely be more inclined to give Outsourced approximately three and a half to near four stars, but don't think it's really reflective and worthy of a full four star effort. I was initially introduced to Russell through various recorded performances I could scrounge up on the Internet. To me, Outsourced, serves as a good example of the comedian's stand-up routine...the birth of certain ideas and comedic inventions which unfortunately were never fully realized (I think largely due to a flat audience).To put it simply, definitely not his best performance... Nonetheless, I am taking a few friends to his performance on February the 18th in Hermosa Beach... confident it's going to be a great show and greatly looking forward to it! Hope to see more releases by Russell in the future."
3,Kind of held back,I have seen some of his other shows and found that this DVD was kind of controlled.. I felt that he was too conscious of the fact that he was making a DVD with this show. I must still admit that it was still really hilarious.
5,Funny as heck!,Great dvd and funny as heck! Greatly packaged and sealed from seller. Now I have to order two more dvds from Russell Peters! Funny man must buy if you haven't already!
2,Peter Russell dvd,It was good except for the foul langage through out the dvd. We had heard him several years ago and didn't realize that the swearing was so much.
1,EXTREMELY poor service,"i am EXTREMELY disappointed.... i never rcvd my product and when i wrote to inquire as to why after over a month, i NEVER rcvd a response back. would not recommend this to anyone!!! >:("
2,A lot of raunchy riffing off of audience names,"Peters' ""Red White and Brown"" is some of the funniest comedy I've ever listened to. Sadly, ""Outsourced"" doesn't even come close to showing Peters' brilliance. Yes, he demonstrates his quick wit riffing off of audience names, but too much of it is too hard core and repetitive. Definitely not for older folks or kids, or for me either I guess..."
4,Hilarious,"Russell Peters is a funny Canadian that has an Indian heritage. Most of the humor is racially based (or maybe regionally based would be a better description), but funny. Certainly less offensive than most racially humorous comedians...I would actually argue that he's not offensive at all.Plus, his impersonations of the numerous types of Asians speaking English (which he claims is the way to distinguish between types of Asians) is hilarious."
4,Hilarious!,This guy was pretty good. Being around Asians since I started working just makes me appreciate the humor even more.
4,"good comedy, average sound quality","Although this doesn't have some of his most famous bits, russell peters fans won't be disappointed. He's definitely one of the best of the current crop of stand-up comedians out there."
2,It wasn't that impressive if you are looking for nice chest...,"I've got this tea chest because I trusted the brand name of Numi but the wooden chest is not what you see from the picture and it is very cheap quality. Should have bought a better chest and fill up my own tea....If you are looking for nice looking chest, this is not the one for you but the tea is great!"
1,Marginal at best,"I ordered this box as Christmas gift, particularly because the box looks like it is real sleek and nice. Looks can be deceiving. When Opened the box was damaged and not returnable. What a waste."
5,Wonderful!,"This is an excellent selection for a gift, or for personal enjoyment. The variety is splendid, and is a great way to try new flavors for which you can purchase a larger box of your favorite. I definetly recommend Numi's blend of teas, the best I've tasted in a while."
2,The Box is not for Keeps,"Do not buy this if you want a box for keeps. It is made of cheap plywood and was already warped when it was delivered.Tea, however, is excellent."
3,few good songs,"this cd was purcased without knowing the track list,if id have known that spice 1 only has 1 new song id have passed,its a good song but the only other spice 1 on the cd is [stuff] from previous albums(1 luv, chocolate philly) and the rest of the cd is filled with a host of rappers i dont really give a damn about, not a very entertaining cd overall, it does have a few good ones(im raw-1 da boy,double up again-daz&kurrupt,pimps players hustlers-spice 1 and some other guys) not worth what i payed though"
4,Nice Product,"It is a nice product, it works perfectly. I have to say that it was a little bit difficult to configure it but after that, using Planex usb wi fi was very easy. It works perfectly with my nintendo wii and my laptop.Es un buen producto, funciona perfectamente. Tengo que decir que fue un poco dificil configurarlo, pero despues de eso usar, usar el Planex usb wi fi fue muy fácil. Fuenciona perfectamente tanto con mi nintendo wii asi como con mi laptop."
3,"Works, but not easy.","This product worked great, but It was quite a hassle to make it work on my windows PC. I used Windows XP. Using the PS3 is alot easier, but If you don't have that option, this is a good alternative. You will need to use Xlnik Kai for it to work."
1,Didn't work,Struggled for hours trying to get it to work. Got email help from company but still didn't work. Sent it back.
1,NOT A SMART PURCHASE,"I consider myself moderately computer savvy. I purchased this for my children so that I could Wifi their Nintendo DS's. After many, many hours of trying to configure, I finally gave up. There was virtually no product support. Adapter is back in box -- I recommend researching the compatibility of your computer system, internet connection, etc. before purchasing."
4,One of the best historical mystery series,"I'm a huge fan of the Chapman mystery series -- I think they're the best historical mysteries written, with the possible exception of the Cadfael stories.This may not be the absolutely best of the series (I rather liked Roger when he was a callow youth) but it still is far better than most in the genre. It has a real flavor for the times, and the main character is as charming as ever. He's grown through the books but never has lost his basic goodness. The story is complex without being overly complicated and the dialog and descriptions are carefully rendered.The ending was a bit of a surprise, which is a good thing.All in all, I don't think any fan of historic mysteries will be disappointed in this series. If possible, start at the beginning and follow through in order since you get to see Roger's character develop."
5,clean and crisp,The book arrived quickly and in perfect order. I enjoy this series and was happy to have the newest edition.
4,pure enjoyment,"i love this cd very much. i just got it last week and along with 'faire celts', it barely leaves my cd player. my two favorite songs are 'adiemus' and 'cantus - song of the trinity'. i've actually found that i like the first half of the cd more right now, but maybe that's just because i haven't listened to it that many times. i would highly recommend this - very soothing and beautiful."
1,Give Me A Break,"Wow, what a coincidence. The first three reviews are written by three different people and they're EXACTLY THE SAME. They all hail the Adiemus website as one of the most incredible sites on the entire web. ON THE ENTIRE WEB. People planting fake reviews to pump up their own revenue make me sick. This music is cheezy at best. Jennings robs from a number of over-used musical genre's, creating, at best, the soundtrack for a bad nature film that doesn't exist."
3,Decent Disc,"This is a decent disc of world music. I loved the first track ""Adiemus"" when a friend played it for me. However, the rest of the tracks of this collection don't measure up to the standard set by the ""Adiemus"" track. If you expect more of the same when buying this CD, you may be disappointed."
2,bag of fail,"dont buy it thats all i gotta say. its a great tach BUT sunpro no longer supports it. The backlight went out i know its not the little box i tested it, so now i have a nice expensive paper weight. At night all i see is a red needle i took it out. The thing quit working on me while driving i didnt drop it or flip the car like a light the el light just quit and sunpro cant fix it."
3,Past its prime,"When I first heard Shelley Berman in teh early '60's, I couldn't get enough. I found the old vinyl album on an old shelf, threw it out and replace it with a new CD. Having listened to it a couple of days ago, I discovered that he was not as witty as i believed him to be when I was 18, some fifty years ago. Frankly I could have done without the purchase, but I wanted to be reminded of the past."
3,Nice CD,This is a nice CD to have in your collection of oldies. I only played it once though. It brought back old memories.
4,"Liar, Liar","This book was interesting, as it focused on Laura instead of the Fab Five for a change. It didn't really make me feel sorry for Laura though. She really is a snob. The book wasn't as exciting as I had hoped it would be either. Still, if you ever get the chance to read it, you should. It just isn't one of my favorites."
3,First disappointment on made incredibly easy book.,"I'm a fan of made incredibly easy nursing book series. So far they provided me with great resources to help me study for my classes. However, I find this book below standard comparing with the other incredibly easy books. In psychiatric nursing, we focused more on client-nurse relationship and communication, and this book failed to accomodate that section which was the essential and core parts of psychiatric nursing. Your best bet is to stick to your textbook and don't bother buying this guide book. It only focuses on medication. Authors, this is not a medical surgical guide book; it is a psychiatric nursing guide book. Please remember that!"
4,Useful and easy to read,I use this in my office as a Psych nurse. I find it to be a usefully easy to read reference book.
3,Good review not enough questions,"I bought this book because I was looking for a good guideline to study for my EC exam for my BSN program.Pros: It is easy to read, and it lists things that are needed to know for the exam.cons: not enough practice questions.for $42 I thought this book would come with a CD of questions.For this test I will be using the Reviews and Rationales mental health nursing instead so I can practice questions."
4,pretty decent,"This book gives a pretty good ""cliff notes"" review of the main topics. It goes along with many textbooks. It can be slightly repetitive, but in general it hits the main topics, gives you a good level of overview, and moves on."
1,Psychiatric Nursing Made Incredibly easy,listers should check this listing the peidatric nursing book is pictured with the psychiatric listing
3,Good value due to its rarity,"I found this DVD to be quite good, an excellent collection from a TV series that has not been seen in decades. The quality of the images and sound is a definite improvement from my earlier DVD's that I've bought in the various local dollar stores. For my money, I think it's definitely worth it."
3,The unsung piece of Americana,"A good introduction of the Church in America from a cultural/historical perspective. As a convert, I was simply amazed at the unsung and unknown contributions this segment of our society has had on our country. This book also helped explain the influences that shaped the controversies the church in America faces today. A Good read for non-catholics and those who want a fuller appreciation of their faith in the context of the ""American Experiment""."
4,"Good Book, Misleading Title","This book was an enjoyable read. I found it especially interesting because I myself am a devout Catholic. However, this book would be helpful to any non-Catholic who is interested in learning more about the Church's history. The facts presented in the book are accurate as far as my knowledge of the Catholic faith goes. I found some of the facts to be disconcerting. The final chapter describes the breakdown or weakening of the Catholic tradition and culture. Catholics should read this book if only for that final chapter. t will open their eyes to the importance of their faith. My only criticism is that the title is misleading. This book is less about particular people and more about Catholic history and culture."
3,Are American Catholics the same as Roman Catholics?,If you know the true answer to my question about American Catholics and what is different about them and Roman Catholics please answer. Thanks
5,Well Written History of the Catholic Church in America,"For those who want to understand the history of Roman Catholicism in America, this book is the answer. Written in an engaging style, ""American Catholic"" traces the history of the development of the church in the United States beginning with the beginnings of the Irish migration in the 1800's, continuing with the remarkable growth throughout the 20th century. The book is objective (as the title implies) and examines different aspects of catholicism, the church, its clergy and laity with clarity and depth.In addition to the historical approach, the third portion of the book examines the many social and political issues, including those that many would prefer to ignore. Yet the author does not appear to have any particular biases or hidden agenda.One may not agree with everything the author says, but his research was extensive and nicely organized into absorbing prose. I recommend this book highly for any student of American history."
5,Sidewalks Memorialized,"This is an excellent rendition which containsthe history of Bronx streets and major thoroughfares.For instance, Ampere Avenue is named after thefamous physicist Andre Ampere. Pelham Bay Parkis described as a collection of well known estates;such as, Roosevelt, Edgar and Le Roy.The book is well organized. The rendition would beperfect for a student project in history or localculture. The price is reasonable for the tremendousvalue of the information and research contained therein.Purchase this book for the student in your house."
5,practical cookery cook book,This book I will cherish and hope to pass it on to my daughter.This book was recommended to me from a friend who has had her book for over 50 years..
4,Great Fun for My Daughter!,My daughter received this for her birthday and absolutely loves it. She has really amazed me with her talents and she likes the booklet that displays and labels the different styles of clothing. She gets a bit frustrated with the size of the tiny pencils but admits that it is handy to carry this around....we took it on a trip and she can carry it to school in her backpack. Definitely worth the money spent for a developing artist!
3,"Great concept, but...","I got this for my 10 year old budding fashion designer. It's a great concept, but I wish it had more models to draw the clothes on, because I think they will all be drawn on in the first afternoon. Also, the glue used to hold all the stuff in the folder got on the bottom of the book and I had to rip several pages to get them apart. The pad with the models on it was glued into the folder too, and I had to rip the back to get the pad out. My child is going to get a gift for Christmas that looks like six other kids have already played with it because the company was a bit too liberal with the glue."
4,My daughter loves it!,"My 7yr old daughter just received this for Christmas and absolutely loves it! She loves to draw and enjoys all things ""girlie"" so this gift was perfect for her. The pencils are small but it's perfect for traveling. Definitely recommend this product."
5,Psychology of trading in a detailed and practical form,"Believe it or not, I had despised the book much just because of its title. I had thought of it as just one of the many thousands of other whatever Q books the cheap marketers try to sell. I had bought it just because it's so ""affordable"" relatively speaking. The fact is: I had been absolutely wrong. Mr. Berstein, a psychologist, really put something solid behind his propositions and recommendations. We read in many books why tips kill. Mr. Berstein really went into the very depth of our minds to explore why we kept on doing stupid things. As a pseudo intellect (ha ha), I bought his concept and that's the very beginning of my new professional trading life (avoiding any form of tipsters and tips). For those who are suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder on ""tips"", this is the book for you and it might help you a lot to stop your tips induced losing streak!"
5,One of the better Pych books,Jake is honest and blunt like you would expect from a good therapist. I especially liked the blend of theory and application when discussing trading problems. This book has essential information that is approached in an interesting way.
2,HUGE DISSAPOINTEMENT,"Very poor book. Too many general stuff. Too many Freud and so little real advices. Completly useless. If you need serious psychology help for your trading, buy Mark Douglas and don't spent money on Bernstein."
1,The Worst Author - Ever,"Save your money. Never, never waste your funds on the drivel this author produces!!A profitable trader would never have time enough to write even one tenth the quantity of words this person produces.Find traders that actually make money to learn from. There are a few that have written good books.As starting points for trading:For equities traders try: Professional Stock TradingFor futures traders try: Trading Day by DayFor psychology of investing try: Trading in the ZoneThese are simply starting points, but are written by REAL traders (Mark Douglas excluded), not worthless-book producers."
2,Heorine a bit of a doormat!,I found the heroin a bit on the whimpy side. She of course loved him and I believe that she did but I didn't believe that he loved her. The only reason he hooked up with her again was to use her for his own ends. Of course he changed his mind but it seemed a bit abrupt especially given that he could sleep with her 11 months earlier for one night only and then move on to another woman never even wondering how that affected Tess emotionally. For some reason she had to drop everything and appear for him for some movie premier. I think it would have been better if he had to work for it a bit more!!
3,Hm...,"Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good release. If you're a TTF fan you will definitely want this. I just feel that Vol. 22 and 24 are better than this one.The best part of this volume for me is the beginning of CD1 - the instrumental hard mix of Brooklyn Bounce's ""Bring it Back"", followed by the phat rap-style-vocals hit ""Jump"" and DJ Dean's superb melodic hit ""Play it Hard"". The 4th track is also quite nice, as is the song ""Reach Out.""If you can't afford this CD or are thinking about getting only one of the recent releases, you can probably skip this one and choose 22 (GREAT!) or 24 (very good). If you're a fan like me, then of course you'll want to add this to your collection."
1,DISAPPOINTED,IF IT LOOKS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE. WHEN I RECIVED MY BOOK THE PAGES WERE BRICK HARD AND STUCK TOGATHER. THEY LEFT ME A NOTE STATED I NEEDED TO UNSTICK THE PAGES.THERE WAS NO WAY THAT COULD BE DONE.AFTER ALL IF IT COULD THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE THEY SENT IT TO ME. 75% OF ALL PAGES ARE RIPPED. IF I HAD KNOWN THE PAGES WERE STUCK LIKE GLUE I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE BOOK. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO ME AND THEY SHOULD MAKE IT RIGHT.
4,Not all the songs are New Wave but still great,"If you are looking for a sole New Wave CD, this is not right, I want Candy and Rock Lobster are nowhere close to being New Wave. Its still a great compilation of hit songs of the 80s, mainly one hit wonders like Whip It, Come on Eileen, Tainted Love, and Cars. It is good for parties if you grew up in that decade and I may not have been born yet during that period, but I enjoyed the music on this CD and is much better than music that is put forth today."
2,New Wave? Not!,"Wang Chung is New Wave? The B52s? Dexy's Midnight Runners? Puh-leeze!!! Where are the New Wave greats, like Missing Persons, The Buggles, Psychedelic Furs, Kajagoogoo, Oingo Boingo (okay, they're borderline, but still), the Fixx, T'Pau...?????This is a so-so collection of 80s tunes, really...nothing special. Get rid of A-Ha, B52s, Stray Cats, Soft Cell (didn't we get enough of them already? They even burned them out on the radio in the late 90s, early 00s!!) and Dexy's Midnight Runners and throw in some classic New Wave (Destination Unknown...everyone remember that one??) and this would be a real buy!"
2,Sticky,"I had high expectations on this product based on the review. It was to replace my Sephora Dry Oil mist which they no longer make. The smell was nice and light, but the mist left my skin feeling sticky, like I was coated in sugar water. Unpleasant feeling, had to wash it off. I'm using Ahava Dry Oil mist. The best one I've found as a replacement."
1,Sticky and a horrible consistency!,"I hated the smell,tthe runny consistency of this product, sticky, and the bottle sprayed all over everything. No wonder Johnson & Johnson discontinued this product!"
1,Sticky,"I was looking forward to find a product that is easy to apply and absorbs fast.Well, its easy to use but it leaves a layer of stickiness that does not go away for hours!I saw others mentioning this but I ignored. I used it twice and that's all."
3,Sticky!,"I was hoping for a nice, light oil mist that would absorb into my skin. I get such sensitive skin in the cold winter months that my back itches and makes me extremely uncomfortable. Since I don't always have someone around to apply regular lotion to my back, I wanted a spray that I could apply myself. I bought the Johnson's after reading several good reviews. I also used it on my legs after showering. To my dismay, I found that it did not absorb very quickly and left a sticky 'film' behind. I felt sweaty more than comfortable and moisturized. I will not be ordering again.Spend a few more bucks on Little Docs Cooling Spray Lotion instead; your skin will thank you!"
3,Johnson Body Mist,The Johnson Mist is Ok but its a little greasy. I was looking for something like Nivea spray lotion that is no longer available.
4,Johnson's Light Mist Oil,The product is very good as the oil is nice and light but the spray nozzle can be improved. It rotates as you keep pumping causing you to miss the target you are spraying.
3,OK I guess,This dry oil spray isn't very dry but it also isn't very expensive. The mild scent evaporates quickly but it dries a just slightly sticky. I like that the spray easily reaches the middle of my back. I will look for a drier product next time.
1,Johnson's light oil mist,"I was really looking forward to this product, but it's very sticky! It does smell good but can't get past the sticky residue."
3,Still oil,"I was looking for a spray moisturizer and have tried a few from amazon.com. This wasn't expensive, so I thought I would try it. I would just say it's ok. The smell is good, but at the end of the day, it's still oil and feels like oil. I wanted something lighter that would ""dry"" into my skin without residue."
3,not an easy pump,"I like the oil mist. Using it after my shower keeps my skin from drying out all day. But the pump top is not easy to use. By the time I've covering my whole body, my finger is sore."
1,It fell just short,"This game has the potential to be great... All of the necessities are there; A lot of systems, Many different weapons, great control interface, the list goes on. The only problem is, It is so buggy that you rarely get to play for more than an hour and a half before the game crashes and you're back you your last save. Even with the patch it still does it, and that's before and after I have reformatted my computer and updated all of my drivers!"
1,Not worth it,"I got the ""ten and under"" bargain bin version. This is supposed to be the fully patched and completely up-to-date version. Even though my PC is well above the minimum and recommended requirements, this game does not work. I went on-line to the game's site, and tried all the fixes suggested in the forums by other owners of the game, none worked. The game still freezes my computer with the Windows 'Blue Screen of Death' requiring me to manually power down my PC. I can't even get more than halfway through the first training mission without the game crashing. I now have an expensive coaster, and another jewel case to use for some other disc that deserves to be protected.This review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com"
1,Does not live up to the hype,"Originally i bought this game as it was hyped as 'the next freelancer' - um, no. Comparing this game to freelancer is like comparing childrens books to war and peace. This game got uninstalled a week after i got it. Yes, i gave it a fair try, and no, the game isnt anything of what it said it would be. If you want a superficial shooter, and have never played freelancer, you might enjoy this game. I would just suggest buying freelancer though, as freelancer is ten times the game for a quarter of the price. DSO simply has no depth to it. They should have never compared this game to freelancer, it doesnt hold a candle to freelancer. (edit) - If you want a game that was REALLY freelancer done right get X3 the reunion."
1,"Unsupported by developers, buggy, and non-returnable","I bought this game for my husband for Christmas and we can't get it to work. The support forums show 13 pages of people getting the same error we are getting, with NO support. There has not been a patch for this game since November of 2006. The developers suggest removing software from your computer prior to installing... software that shouldn't have to be removed to install a game (Sonic My DVD, Nero in CD, etc.)How about fixing the game!And, of course, opened software is non-returnable... complete waste of money!It doesn't deserve the 1 star I had to give it to get this review posted...."
4,Highly addictive,"I played Freelancer a few years ago and it was the best space game I've ever played. I originally downloaded the demo of DS1 a few months ago and couldn't figure out the controls.I got the official version and as soon as I figured out how the controls worked, I was hooked.This is not Freelancer by any means, but it was a lot of fun, and the story line was pretty decent too."
2,fun when it works - do not buy if you have widescreen monitor,"When Darkstar One works, it is a lot of fun. However, as others have said, it is buggy.By far the single most annoying bug I've encountered is that every single time I start the game with 1680x1050 (guessing any widescreen resolution), the game crashes immediately with a cryptic error message. The next time I try to start it, it works but *all* options are reset to default (which requires adjusting video options *except* resolution, exiting the game, restarting the game, and then setting the resolution). Of course, if it crashes or if I forget to change the resolution before exiting, I have to go through it again the next time."
2,not worth the money,It is easy and intuitive. There are plenty of pirates to shoot and missions to choose from. jumping to different sectors is good. You don't have to rely on trading to make money.It feels kinda empty and there not much fun in playing a second time.Having to tug a your shipments behind you is not fun.
1,"Technical competence, not for the casual opera listener.","The is a work for operatic technicians, not casual listeners. It is a well researched work of how to identify when you've found the original version of a libretto. I had hoped to find the opera's ""words""= libretto. Opera naivete'on my part.

Peter is a dynamic performer with incredible personality! This cd is a must for anyone who enjoys the best in reggae music! He is the closest to Bob Marley that anyone can get!"
1,Don't waste your money,Broke after a couple of weeks. Totally worthless. Look for a better alternative even if you have to pay a few more dollars.
3,Functions fine but not the best,"The clock attaches well, functions well but is often hard to read due to the highly reflective covering over the display."
4,"Great make-your-own screen, good price","Very easy to install, only thing better would have been 2 more velcro strips on the sides, but other than that, this is a great product!"
3,Tight at the shoulders.,"If you have high traffic on the door, imo, it's not going to replace a real screen door. The two panels are fastened at the very top, making it tight on the shoulders (36"" wide model), when passing through. For ventilation, and only low traffic, it should be adequate. In fairness, this is a well made product (4+ stars!). The mesh is high quality, and all the double stick tape and magnetic attachments, performed as promised."
3,It Works as Advertised,"The product is everything it claimed. However two issues effect its performance in our application:1.There is a raised threshold just behind the screen and this impedes the closing of the screen.2.I am 5'10"" and pushing through the screen my shoulders are restricted by the screen due to the join at the top.Review you application carefully. A taller door would be better"
5,Door Bug Screen,"I purchased this Door Bug Screen from Amazon to allow our three little terriers to come and go easily to their outside play yard. As advertised it is a very easy unit to install,requiring now tools. All you have to do is place the curtin rod at the top of the door and unscrew the one side so it is about 5 to 10 inches longer then the width of your door then place the two sided velcro fastner tapes along each side ajacent to the matching velcro on the screens. It only took us several minutes to teach our pups how to go in and out thru the middle of screen and now they rush in and out with now problem. The screen does re-fasten at the magnets as advertised for both dogs and people and has kept bugs from coming into the house. I would recommend this Door Bug Screen for anyone wanting to leave there door open and have easy access without having to always open and close the door."
4,Good and easy to install,"This was incredibly easy to install (I'm the mom). All I had to do was get a chair to stand on to get it in the doorway. There is a square magnet at the bottom and about 2 feet above that is another square magnet. That's all there is to hold the split screen together. Works pretty well. I only had to show my 2 year old how to get through it once and now he's a champ. It stays pretty narrow at the top so tall people might get annoyed. My husband hasn't complained, yet and he's almost 6 ft. It's a little awkward getting through if you're carrying stuff, like when we grill. But the plus side is that now I can open the back door (in good weather) and allow the children to go in and out at their whim and i'm not worried about mosquitoes and flies coming into the house."
1,What a waste!!!,"If you want to throw your money away, find a better cause. Extremely poor construction, does not hang properly, absolutely nothing about this works. I actually spent more money attempting to correct the poor sewing and lousy finishing on the edges only to to throw it away."
2,If only it worked!,"Great idea,too bad it did quite live up to expectations. The main thing wrong is that there are only 2 magnets and they don't catch well enough to keep the screen closed. Called the company to report the problem. They took my name and number but never called back."
2,save your money,We thought this was the screen door with the magnets that actually pull it together. It's not. It overlaps. It also seems to be a little longer in the middle than on the sides so it drags in the middle and you have to physically close it which defeats the purpose. Our last screen was a mesh drape. It worked better. With this product we have more flies and bugs. It's as if there is nothing on our door at all! They got their money off of me!
2,Wrong Size - inside and out,"This product came in a different size than what we ordered, plus the size indicated on the box was different than the actual product. Neither of the sizes were right!"
4,Works Well,I have a 36x96 pocket slider which they do not make a screen for. This solved the problem. My minor complaint is they need some more velcro on the sides and a couple of extra magnets in the middle. But for the price and my situation it was a good buy.
3,Bug off screen door,"Not a huge fan of this screen. I haven't gotten to use it much yet. My husband hates it because he is tall (6'3"") and has a difficult time getting through it. It doesn't meet just right like it has been stretched just above the magnet causing a large gap for insects to get in. You always have to straighten the bottom of it after going through because it doesn't have a magnet to pull it together."
2,ali,Very disappointed in this item - the magnets do not keep the screens together evenly. The spring bar that keeps it hanging falls down if you pull on the screen to hard. When it rains the screen gets so heavy from water that you can't go through it and the dog gets soaked. I would return this product but it is better than no screen at all to let some air in and keep bugs out so we are keeping it. Not good quality and very diappointing.
2,It is not as good as I thought it would be,"It is not as good as I thought it would be - I have it on my french doors so the opening is smaller then a regular entry door. The opening in the screen is small and I am not a very large person (5' 5"" average weight) so if it seems small to me it wouldn't work very well for a larger person. I kept getting caught up in the screen when going in and out with food when I was grilling. It works good for my dog, he goes in and out easily. The other thing is it doesn't close all the way when the dog comes in it pulls into the house stays open a little and I notice bugs getting in more now then before using this screen. I purchased to replace my sliding screen because the wheel broke and the door kept coming off the tracks. I will break down and by a new door before next summer."
4,Great Product!,"I tried building one of these for a sliding glass door some years back with modest success, but it never worked as well as this one. They've worked out all the ""bugs"" so to speak. For a standard 32"" door, the opening is a bit narrow, but with the dogs and cats coming and going, I can adjust. Great product at a fair price, and it works! I would buy one again."
3,Decent Product,"No real complaints -- works as advertised --easy to train dogs to use it -- one caveat: we live on a hill top where it is quite windy, and the number of magnetics on the screen is not sufficient to keep it closed all the time. I think, though, it would be easy to buy and add a couple of magnets."
5,Great buy,"It keeps most bugs out, and my dog took to it after a few days. He is bigger and taller (GShep), but he eventually got used to going in and out with ease. We rent, so we could not have a screen door. This screen is a great investment. SO HAPPY with it."
1,I returned it,"After reading reviews and then looking further at what would suit our needs, we ended up installing a tension rod with a sheer curtain. This works for me better since my dogs did not want to go through the screen."
2,it's not worth the money I paid.,"I thought it is good solution to prevent bugs, but I was wrong because of many bad issues in its design such as: the stickers on the two sides do not bear when a man come through the curtain, and I think they designed it for the pets not for human; also, its need more stickers in both sides to be strong. Second, it is hinder the movement when passing through it because they were sewing the upper middle of the curtain and that is an obstacle when you through it - especially if you are tall. I thought when I buy an expensive one; it will satisfy me. But I regretted when I bought and tried it."
1,Garbage,"My husband and I had purchased a much cheaper version of this product and were pleased with the concept but not the conctruction and thought you get what you pay for. We ordered the Instant screen as replacement for the cheaper version hoping for a better constructed screen and better fabric but this product was anything but better. Screen does not close properly, the fabric is stiff and the fastners for the sides would not stay in place. DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY!!!"
1,Bug Screen that doesn't work,"I bought this so I could let my dog get in and out of the house. There are only 2 magnets on this and that is nowhere near enough. When you go out through the screen it doesn't come back together. It should be called ""Come on in bug screen"". I bought it in April but didn't try it out till 2 weeks ago. I asked the company about returns and they just send me a blank email so I guess I am stuck with it. I wouldn't recommend the product or the company at this point."
1,Totally Useless,"Doesn't work anywhere near as good as advertised. Does not close properly - there are big gaps that appear where the two sides meet. It seems like if it was heavier, or had more weights on the bottom, it might close better. Very disappointed as this purchase was pretty much a waste of money."
1,rod falls off,"Every time we go through the screen the rod falls down and the entire screen falls off. Also, not good for people over six feet talk (have to duck to go through.)"
2,Bug Off Instant Screen,Returned because screen gapped between magnets leaving openings for bugs to get in. Material was of average quality. Screen did block out alot of sunlight. Easy install.
3,meh,"It's not junk, but I'm definitely not overly impressed. I guess when Amazon recommended the additional velcro I should have taken the hint. I know it sounds stupid, but I put this back into the old sliding screen frame on my door and use it that way. Seems to work fairly well this way."
4,dogs love it!!,"This screen is very cool, literally! it allows the morning brease to flow through our house in the morning when it's cool, and our two dogs to pop in and out as easily as they like. We are having trouble keeping the screen up, I unfortunately threw away the two support arms that came with the screen, so we are workng on training the dogs to gently use the slit entrance rather than barging in through the bottom. I would recomend this product, but don't toss anything out until you've used it for a week ot two.Bug Off 72 by 80 Instant Screen, Fits Some French Doors and 12-Foot Sliding Glass Doors"
4,Works well,"Bought this so that my kids can run in and out without letting bugs in and it does a great job. The sticky velcro lost some of it's tack when I needed to reposition, but I added some double sided tape and it's fine."
5,Perfect solution!,Have no problems with this Bug off Screen. It took 5 mins to be placed and works perfect now! It is 1 month since I bought it. Have no problems yet and very satisfied.
2,Great idea but...,The tension rod does not hold the curtain up well enough. It keeps falling down. Im trying to use velcro to replace the tension rod
1,self closing screen,"this is basically 2 pieces of screen material. they weight the bottom and install very weak magnets in the center and at the bottom. the screens overlap, so use the correct side when going in or out, or the screen will not close correctly. bug off only works when you use the correct side of the screen and make sure it closes behind you. other than that, you're leaving a gap for plenty of bugs to enter. may as well cut a strip down your screen and enter through that. it'll leave a gap afterwards, but so will bug off. i thought a whole row of magnets will come close the screen, instead of just 2. also thought you you could enter either side, not worrying about the screen hanging open. yes, it's installed correctly. it just doesn't work. it's better than leaving the door wide open, but it doesn't prevent bugs from coming in. not even close."
2,Not worth it,Put the item in my doorway today. Installation was easy. I wasn't happy with the lack of magnets... there is basically one. There is one at the bottom as well but just not enough to keep anything out. it doesn't close well at all. There is no way I would trust this at night with lights on in the house here in Wisconsin. It will go back and I'll purchase a new sliding door instead.
4,"fast, easy, convenient","My parents have been using this product for a few years, so when I needed a fast replacement for broken storm door (broken by storm), I went with this product. Works like a charm, took only few minutes to install."
2,Does not fit every door and has only 2 magnets,"Depending on how your door is framed and the shape of the threshold, this may not work for you. With only two magnets, it must hang free and clear to work properly. Even then, two magnets is not enough. Also, the way the screen flaps are connected at the top makes it difficult for a taller person to go through, especially when carrying something. I would have returned this item if it was not such a hassle. That's way I buy most things at Costco."
2,Not what I thought,"Because of the great reviews I bought this for my sliding door because of my dog. We could not get this to fit right. When someone walked through it, it did not shut behind you but gapped open. This would be a problem for bugs to fly in during the summer. Also it was so long that the fit was just not right. I will be returning this item."
2,Keeps the bugs out but falls when you walk through,"I love/hate this product. I love the product because it allows me to open my front door (36x80) to let a breeze flow through. It also seems to do a good job at keeping the bugs out. However, I hate this product because it falls down when you walk through it. I tried to get the rod to fit my door frame as snugly as possible, but sometimes it ends up falling down and hitting people on the head as they walk through the screen/door.The main problem is the at the rubber feet have no tread or ""grip"" on them so they slide off easily no matter how tight you try to get the rod to fit. I think this product is great if you just need a removable screen and want to use it for your pets but its definitely not meant for a high traffic area."
3,Be sure and measure your door width!,"I have used these types if screens for several years. I purchased this in Novemeber but did not unpack until April. When I put it up it is 1"" less than my door width leaving a gap on each side of the screen. All the others were wider than the door so there was no gap. The product is well put together so if your door is less than 34"" wide you will be ok. It was my fault for not measuring before ordering, but previous screens were much wider for a single door."
4,Bug Off Screen,Love it. My wife and I enjoy open windows and fresh air. This was so easy to install and the dogs love being able to go in and out as they please now.
4,it works pretty darn well,"Easy to install..quickly!!! We take it down and put it back up all the time. However, it's NOT foolproof... If a bug is determined, it'll find the tiny gap(s) along the bottom or top... However, for what it does in keeping the majority out, I'd certainly recommend this!!!"
1,Not so good,"We purchased this to put on our door leading out to the deck. Not just for bugs, but to let the dogs go in and out without a problem. The velcro that connects to the door frame is not very strong and the spring in the top piece that is to hold the screen up does not stay up. We have continuiously had to try tightening it at the top of the door to no avail. Would not recommend this if you are going to go in and out of the door."
1,rip -off price,Same item available at Home Depot for about $20.00!!!!!!!!!! -- I wish I'd knownscreen works fine..not 100% but better than just leaving the screen door wide open for the dogs
4,Works well,"After reading all the reviews I decided to buy this screen. We have two great danes and we didn't want to spend a crazy amount on a dog door. This is works well. There are magnets in the middle and along the bottom for closure. There are also four velcro attachments- two at top and two at bottom- to connect to the outside door area. It seems a big long but it still works well. The pole at the top adjusts.There have been times when I've stepped on the bottom of it on accident and the pole fell down, however, the velcro stayed in place so it didn't collapse on me.I would change the length to a shorter length by just an inch or so and I'd put another magnet in the top middle to hold it closed because sometimes it leaves an opening at the top.Overall I do recommend. Its cost was not to much and it works well."
3,A very short term fix,"We bought this screen for our dogs to use to come and go as they please in the summer. They got the hang of using it quite easily and that was the best part about it.As far as the durability goes, not so good. Many times if the dogs saw a squirrel in the yard and they went tearing out the screen, the force of their heads hitting the screen would pull the tension rod right down.The velcro that attaches to the sides of your opening does not stick for long. We have tried sanding, and using products such as goof off to take the slickness off of the vinyl that the velco wont attach to, but still it ends up coming away.Thirdly, the magnet that is supposed to swing the screens back together, doesnt always hit perfectly and you are left with a gap for bugs to get in.The concept is good but it needs to have a more permanent way to adhere to your opening and it needs to be able to stand up to more wear and tear from your pets and from you using it to enter and exit your home through it."
3,screen,this product is good in the fact that our dog won't scratch at it and ruin another screen door. It is not that great however at keeping a really good seal of mesh against the bugs.
4,One glitch but worth the money,"This door works great when going outside but coming back in, the bottom catches on the threshhold and doesn't close properly. I still feel it's worth the money since I got it at a great price and even though it stays open a bit at the bottom, it's still better than a wide open doorway when it comes to keeping bugs out. Now my dog can enjoy the freedom of going in and out whenever he wants."
5,Effective bug screen for a good price,The screen was a cinch to install on our back door and has been holding up great after over 6 months of use.
3,fine but not quite as described,The screen was easy to set up and keeps the bugs out for most of the part. But it does not close back automatically like description of the product suggested and some bugs crawl between the two screens to sneak inside. (i.e. screens do not shut tight). It is fine but not great.
1,needs more magnets,"I bought screen for my sliding glass door as some of my friends just walk into my sliding screen. so my son put it up lastnight, and can't make it stay closed should have MORE magnets, when i walk out the door I have to pull it closed, won't shut by it self. and to short as a lizzard came into my house this morning under the screen. I really don't like it..."
3,Bug Off Screen,"The product does well for people, but not for pets. The screen material is a bit too flexible and should be more rigid. The magnets could be a bit more powerful to pull closed when my dog goes through the opening. I believe thar the produce would be better if the opening met in the middle and not overlapped. As it is designed now, my dog goes in and out on the same side of the screen causing it to remain open at the bottom."
5,Why didn't I think of this clever idea!?,"I love this product so far. Shipping was immediate. It was suppose to arrive in 5 to 7 days, but came in 2! Easy installation... took less than 5 minutes. The golden retriever is already using it like a pro. Would highly recommend this product."
4,BUG OFF,"Overall I am satisfied with this product, the mesh is heavy duty and I have not had any problem with the tension rod. I taught my dog how to use it very quickly. It is not perfect though. There are only a couple of magnets- so if they don't catch- you will have a gap. But it is MUCH better than nothing- which is what we have had for years.We used it for several months this spring and just took it down - summer is here in Arizona- so we will not be keeping the door open. I rolled it up and will put it back up again this fall. You do have to duck down a bit to get in and out. But the small drawbacks are ok with me to be able to keep out (the majority) of bugs and enjoy the nice weather."
2,Doesnt work well on a small door,"This is a good idea and I think if my opening was larger it might work fine. I am also 6'-5"" and it slows me down a bit trying to get out the door. We are returning and going back to the old sliding screen door."
3,Not the best but it works,"I bought this screen to go on the door to the garage because my husband always leaves the door open. It works as long as the wind is not blowing. If the wind blows it undoes the magnets. I may have to purchase a couple more magnets to put on so it stays closed better. Also, when the door is closed it is hard to get to the door handle. I had to rig it so the screen will fold open when the door is closed so I can get to the hangle. It is worth the money I spent."
1,Needs more magnets,This item would have been great if it had more magnets. I bought it based on the reviews and was really let down in the end. It gapped in the areas where there were no magnets and had a lot of slack which in turn let a lot of bugs in. I ended up buying the magnetic mesh screen door cover which has a LOT more magnets and works great. Take my advice and go with another producct.
2,Don't waste your money,"First, there are not enough magnets. Secondly, the gapping leaves plenty of room for even the most unmotivated bugs to get through. Remove the sticky stuff attaching the velcro, and it won't restick....which makes me wonder if you're supposed to only use this for one year before you throw it out. After all, it's supposed to come in for the winter, and then you would rehang it how????We are going to attempt to ""fix"" this with more velcro, command strips, magnets if we can find them.... Go for a better brand if you can afford it, or make your own from screening from Home Depot, two sided velcro and magnets."
2,Does not work very well,"I purchased this product, having owned a similar screen before with good results. This one was constantly, and I mean constantly, falling down. Granted, we have 3 dogs and 2 kids, but it fell down almost everytime even just my husband or I went out. The spring loaded bar that holds it in place never stays tight enough to hold it up. Also, its supposed to fall closed after someone, or something, goes in or out. It works pretty good closing by itself when you are going from inside to outside, but not from outside to inside. I ended up getting rid of the spring loaded bar that did absolutely nothing and attached the top part of the screen to the door frame with heavy duty velcro. That works about 100% better, although it still doesnt close all the way but at least i am not constantly putting the thing back up."
5,Let the dog out,"What an energy saver. No more running down to let the dog out or running around to swat the flys. Everybody's happy. Easy install, good fit, and dog adapted immediately to the extra freedom (so did the cat)."
3,"Better than nothing, maybe","It's better than nothing I suppose, but the design has a gap a the top (above the tension rod) and the bottom doesn't completely seal off either, so bugs will get in. If you are planning to use this on a doorway that gets a lot of use, the 'flap' you have to walk through will probably get annoying pretty quickly. I use it to let fresh air into my office on a doorway that's rarely used. Actually the stink-bugs probably use this door more than I do. The screen does nothing to keep them out."
3,Does the job - needs more magnets,good overall performance - needs more magnets to seal the screen closed all the way. Easy set up and removal for the winter.
3,works ok,"Works ok, didn't close well all the time and only lasted one season. But it was better than not having a screen for the dogs to go in & out by themselves while the weather was nice."
5,Very Happy,"I am unduly happy about this screen. It's solves my problem perfectly and is completely simple to install. My dogs figured it out with only a few pieces of beef jerky. It sometimes doesn't close all the way at the bottom because of how my door frame is, but I'm sure with a little tweaking I could fix that. It still keeps out the bugs, lets the air and light in and gives the dogs freedom. It's for my front door, so bringing packages in and out is a bit more challenging, but it's an easy tradeoff. It covers the spaces at the top and sides so the mosquitoes seem completely foiled. Both my front door and my security screen door can close with it in place. Clever product."
5,Bug Off Instant Screen Door Review,I love this product. We have used it for 7 years at least. During the spring is the perfect time. Our dogs have access to the back yard without us getting up and down every few minutes when they hear a noise. The dogs learned easily how to walk in and out of it. One time doing it and they had it down pat. Would hate to go a year without it. Buy one about every 2-3 yrs.
4,Not for Mobile Homes,Great product and fast shipping but mobile home owners should pass seeing how our door sizes are different from a regular home.
1,Sucks,"Velcros sucks, the magnets do stick to each other but leaves big gap in the middle of the screen so bugs just cruise in. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks."
2,Disappointed,I live in an old apartment - ground floor - flys love this place UHG. So I decided to buy this instead of a screen door. Anyway the flies still got in and I never figured out how to walk through the *door* without knocking it down - so I am not impressed.
1,Horrible,"Only has two magnets on it that don't stay closed.DO NOT BUY, is not comparable to MAGIC MESH!!!"
1,Not received...yet.....,I ordered this product and with Amazon prime I should have received it Sept 2 it is now Sept 16 and still no product has shown up.....????? I have no way to contact anyone so hoping this shows up and is what I am expecting cause I am not to happy right now.
2,good but easy to fall off,"It can only be used at non-heavy traffic doors. It might falls off if you go through it very often. It is really to be installed, but it is also very easy to fall off."
2,"Purchased for sliding door, returned in two days.","This was not as expected. Some will say what did you expect for this price but I was just not happy with the overall quality of this item. Although I measured and made sure I ordered the right size, it did not fit as it should. It felt very cheap and the velcro always came undone. Granted, you shouldn't expect much for this price but I still expect a decent product. I would not recommend anyone this product."
2,bug off rip off,dont waste your money on this product. there are two weak magnets that are supposed to secure the two sides of the screen together. upon exiting the closure the magnets rarely seal back together. dont confuse bug off with magic mesh as the magic mesh screen door closure has eighteen magnets that work very well-every time.
4,bug screen,"things went better than expected and arrived early. I am very happy with Amazon and would recomend it to my friends & family. Thanks so muvh,"
2,DOES NOT FUNCTION AS ADVERTISED,"IT IS NOT VERY OFTEN I HAVE TO RETURN AN ITEM, BUT THE BUG OFF SCREEN DOES NOT FUNCTION AS ADVERTISED. THE POLE DOES NOT STAY IN PLACE. THE VELCRO ATTACHMENTS DO NOT HOLD AND THE MAGNETS DO NOT CATCH EACH OTHER WHEN GOING IN AND OUT OF THE SCREEN DOOR. FROM THE REVIEWS POSTED HERE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A IDEAL MATCHING DOOR SPACE FOR EVERYTHING TO WORK PROPERLY. MY CHIHUAHUAS DO NOT LIKE THE DARK COLOR. IT CONFUSES THEM. THEY REACT AS IF THEY CAN'T GO THROUGH IT. SORRY AMAZON, BUT I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH MY REVIEW."
1,Not good in breezy locations,"I had such high hopes for this screen to replace the damaged patio screen at my home. After redrilling several mounting screws on my slider door frame and changing their location because they were in the way of the premounted hook and loop on the Bug Off screen... I finally hung the screen and attached the mounting tape. It was most disappointing to see both halves of the screen blowing into my living room with only the slightest breeze. The magnets were never able to hang together to close and certainly did not keep any insects out... in fact these panels prevented me from being able to close my door without a great deal of trouble. I tried everything I knew to do to make this work because it seemed like such a good idea.I believe the ""Bug Off Screen"" would probably work in a dead calm area, but if you have any breeze at all... your ""Bug Off"" will become a Bug-Welcome-to-your-new-Home invitation!"
2,It only has in 1 magnet,"I also own the taller 96"" version, but this shorter version only comes with one magnet to close the screen. That is a flaw, as the screen doesn't close very easily. If it had two magnets like the taller ones it would work much better. Can't recommend."
2,Works - but with help,"The screen installs easily and, when closed manually, works well. However, when simply walked through the closure doesn't close completely. That may be because of the width of my door opening being slightly more than 60."" Buyers should know that if you have an opening slightly more than 60"", you will have to force close the magnets as they don't quite meet without that assistance."
4,"Works fine, but not perfect","This screen allowed me to put a screen door where I was unable to install a normal screen door due to the design of the entryway. It works pretty well, but there are sometimes gaps where bugs can get through. I am fairly tall (6'3"") and it is sometimes tough to poke my head through the screen since it is tight up near the top. I need to duck to get through.Overall, I do like it because it provides me with fresh air in my kitchen, was a piece of cake to install and tough enough to stand up to the kids. Would purchase again."
4,Moveable screen door,"Great item. The cat comes and goes when it whats to. The breezes through the house are greatly improved. It is not totally mesquito proof, but flies don't get in."
4,"Good, but some drawbacks.","We have bought three of these now. They do work great, but our dogs run in and out a lot and the screen rips apart from the magnetic strip at the bottom after a while and the velcro does come off the door frame sometimes. My mom is 83, and she has trouble putting up the tension rod due to her loss of strength; but for anyone else the installation is REALLY easy. All in all we like it, just wish it help up to our Jack Russell traffic!!!"
3,Good deal!,"I like this screen door since it's great for pets. However, I do have an issue with it falling a lot, and having to reset it. For the price and given that I couldn't find a real screen door to fit in the doorway, this is a great compromise."
2,Bug Off bugs off,I really like it but it doesn't last very long. This was a replacement purchase for one I've only had 2 years. It starts to split and tear even with normal (and careful) use after about a year.
1,Falls off the door,The first day it pulled the paint off so that the velcro would no longer stick. I tried to staple it on the door jam. It works. Not what I expected. Magnets are weak.
1,Back to yelling close the door,"I was so excited to get this product, I put it up as soon as I got and was disappointed. The magnet was not very strong and it took forever to close, a moth flew in the house after the first walk through. You you be better off putting curtain in the doorway. Sent it back the next day :( Sad because it's a great concept."
4,Helps to keep flys out,"Nice, has helped to keep the bugs out of the garage and still I get the cool air in. Priced well and easy to install only took a few min. I ordered another one for the patio door."
5,Bug Off Instant Screen Door,"I am truely happy with my purchase of the Instant Screen Door. I leave it on all the time. I have looked everywhere for this screen. I was delighted that I found it on Amazon.com. It is very well made and fits perfect on my door. It was more expensive than I wanted to pay. But, you get what you pay for. Perfection."
4,Love it!,Cheap and versatile...you can't go wrong with this product if you want to enjoy fresh air without mosquito bites.
3,instant screen door,"It's ok. It serves its purpose, and while I don't know how long it will last, It's fine for now. It was simple to put up. I may have measured wrong, but it wasn't long enough for my door, and when I leave my door open I put a rolled up towel underneath so nothing comes in. One of my complaints is that many people have thought I was in mourning, because the screen is so DARK! They kept asking ""why do you have that black cloth hang over you door?!""And while the magnets to keep it closed in the center do work, It's also a little funky to manuver when you have you hands full, or trying to get out with a dog, who is also trying to get out of the WRONG SIDE (taped down with velcro).....So usually I don't have door open with the screen unless I plan NOT to be going in and out........I imagine overuse would eventually wear out the magnets or velcro....and for $40, I don't know if its worth it."
5,great,"Saw this on tv, just what my daughter was needing for her sliding doors.Was very pleased with construction an ease of insall she loves it."
4,Good idea,"I ordered this for the patio sliding glass door. The order came from AZ next day to CA. I was able to install this all by myself. We waited for few days before using the tape to attached to the door frame. This worked for our purpose to keep the bugs out but not sure how one will go in and out without ""hands""."
2,Does not seal very well,"The durability of the screen and the attachment methods are great. It uses a decent quality expansion rod and good sticking velcro to adhere the screen to each side. However, there are only magnets in the middle and bottom of the screen. This creates a gap where bugs enter. I've seen other products where there are magnets placed every approx. 6"" down the screen opening and they seal much tighter. I'm going to keep this since I threw away the packaging but I plan on buying another equivalent product that seals much better."
2,Pretty much useless,"It only has two magnets, and they are the very weak refrigerator door style magnets that barely hold together even if you push them together. Every time you walk through this thing you have to manually push the magnets together and smooth out the wrinkles so that it doesn't have huge gaps letting bugs through.Maybe I just need a different size? It does seem to drag the ground a bit. I will see if I can return it and order a different size. If so I'll come back and update this review. Either way it still needs more magnets to help it close better."
2,Semi-Effective at Best,"Living feet from the ocean, we like to keep the doors open all year 'round, unfortunately our little traditional Mexican bungalow doesn't have screen doors.First of all, the thing looks terrible. I mean, I know it's not going to be great looking, but I was hoping for something a little less Boy Scout Jamboree Chic. Secondly, flies seem to have no problem getting around or through the magnetic closure. In fact, I think they have an easier time of it than I do.A terrible purchase. Look elsewhere!"
2,Not that good,"I thought this would be a the best option for our back door to stop the bugs getting in. It mostly works but the screen material is a little stiff (which means it will be less likely to rip it also makes it harder to get through, especially if you are carrying anything like a plate of food). Also, it only has 2 magnets and has to overlap in the correct way - which neither my son or dog ever do except by chance.We had a friend who saw it, thought it was a great idea and then went to Walgreens to get the ""As Seen On TV"" version. After seeing that one, we ended up replacing ours with that one for less than half the price. The screen material doesn't seem quite as good but it's more flexible and easier to go through and it seals *much* better. It has a row of magnets that always seal tight and also since it doesn't have the bar at the top, there is no gap for bugs to get in.tl;dr version: Get the ""As Seen On TV"" version from Walgreens instead."
5,Buf Off Instant Screen,"Great product for what we need. Now, if I can just get the dog to use it instead of sniffing at it! In time, she will get used to it."
4,"Good product, good price",For what it is this screen is great. The rod isn't quite large enough and sometimes slips down the inside of our metal door frame we use this on. Also it is difficult to get the length just right on the floor so that the screen will close if you have any raises in the floor from say the door frame.Could also use more magnets...only has one set in the middle and one set at the bottom.The velcro that sticks to the door frame is white while the screen's velcro is black. I suppose they make the velcro white b/c they assume most frames the screen are going into are light colours but our doorframe is a dark brown so the white is noticeable and a little bit cheesy.But it does the trick. It's a good price. It keeps the bugs out. My dog can enter and exit easily. It has nice netting so you still get a breeze through the house.
5,Super easy to install,We are really happy we got this screen. It helped to let the breeze in and keep the bugs out. Our cat figured it out and the magnets close behind very well.
2,very flimsy,"I returned it...very flimsy and the magnets do not magically line up and re-clasp to secure the screen. I think if you just wanted a screen to hang, not open and close it would be OK."
2,Works ok,"I bought this hoping to leave it in place on my back door. It is easy to install and works ok (You do have to fiddle with the opening after you go through it to get the magnets to snap together. Also the open is very tight. The top of the screen doesn't open so you feel like you are squeezing through it everytime you use it. I am 6'2"" and about 225 lbs. I wouldn't recommend it for a door that gets used a lot. But it will keep the bugs out if you open the door."
4,"Simple setup, keeps the bugs out","I have this screen on my back door. On hot summer nights, I like to open my door to ventilate my room. The magnets do a good job of keeping the middle together, unlike the Velcro tape which didn't really do the job of sealing the edges. This was easily resolved with a stapler."
2,ok,"doesn't close by itself, you must turn around and put the magnets together. had to buy snaps to keep screen attached to doorway."
4,GREAT,ONLY 4 stars since the sides do not stay put. but this worked great for our french doors. we looked around and didn't find any solution for less than 200 bucks. this worked great the mesh was thick and it kept the bugs out. just need to figure out a solution for keeping it down on the sides.
4,Solid product,This is solid product. Easy and simple install. IMHO there are too few magnets and thus the unit is not as effective as it could have been. If you are ok with manually connecting the magnets each time (not a heavy burden) then it is an enjoyable product without a big price tag.
3,Glad I bought this instead of installing a pet door,"I considered installing a pet door but opted for this instead and I'm glad I went with this. I have kept this hung in my patio door that leads to my fenced back yard all summer. During decent weather, I just open the glass door and now my two small dogs can go in and out as they please. It has saved me several daily trips to open the door for busy dogs who constantly want in and out to chase a squirrel, bark at a falling leaf or go potty.The screen is very strong and for 3 months now it hasn't torn even though my terrier vigorously scratches on it almost daily. The only negative is this might be overpriced because I saw one a lot like it in a store recently that was only $14. I didn't check out the details of the $14 version so it might be cheaper because it may not have included a tension rod or maybe the screen is lower quality."
5,Excellent for Dog door,Installed this on our Sliding Door so the dogs can come and go as they want. I am still able to close the glass door and the outer screen door. It does well to stay closed. Didnt take long for the dogs to figure out how to get in and out. Well worth the money.
4,"Good, but could be better","I purchased this to use on my front door because I didn't want a permanently installed screen door which would block the effect of my beveled glass door. It works, but if there's a good breeze, the magnets come apart. It would work better if there were more than 2 magnets. I purchased some wide magnetic tape, but it won't stick to the screen very well. Will have to sew it on somehow."
2,dog door,"magnets definitely not strong enough and it does not stay closed. will not buy, have to adjusted heights 3 times, still not good"
3,Not the good one...,"I thought I was getting the good screen I had seen at some friends houses (from the description given). The one thats Velcro'd on, with magnets all the way down the opening that really opens and closes when you walk through. This isnt it. It fits well with the shower rod type top rail and the few velcro'd side attachements and weighted bottom. The opening only has one magnet though and it takes some attention to get it closed right. Automatic it is not. Luckily it was for a 6 foot wide door we never use as an entrance and our dogs dont go through. Once we get it closed perfectly, we leave it alone and it will stay ""closed"" (at least until a breeze blows though). Had I been able to open it and install it upon receipt, I would have returned it (I wasnt home for many weeks)."
1,"Awful, sent a strongly worded letter with my return","Awful awful awful. Sent a letter to the company telling them to quit making this product. Doesn't stick, doesn't close, magnets fall off, blows open in the wind. Enough said."
2,Bug Off Instant Screen Door,"its okay, better than no screen...... but the velcro doesn't stay on the wood door - had to reinforce it & still not good. the magnets stick to my metal security door......... as I said better than nothing."
3,Good value for what it is.,"This screen does the job. My cats love it - and kids love it. It is a little harder to adjust the height than I thought it would be - so there are sometimes some gaps in the screen, but nothing I'm too worried about. The biggest drawback is that it is not great for tall people. Because it is like a tent opening, the clearance is a bit low for my 6'2"" spouse. However, as I said in the title, it does the job we were looking for and is a good option for the price. The MANY kids going in and out of our sliding door over the years is what caused our standard door to malfunction. We hope to get a couple of good years out of this option!"
1,It's not easily adapted to smaller doors.,When we received the product we were unable to modify it to the size of our door without cutting it down.
4,Not perfect but FAR cheaper than a screen door.,Had this for about 2 months now. It's not a screen door but it's far cheaper and does work. My dogs learned to get through it and it has stayed up except for when one of them hit it off center and when I nearly clotheslined myself on it. Even then all it did was pull the top bar down.I did not superglue or caulk the velcro pads to the door frame. Just the sticky stuff they come with. Have stayed up without trouble. Hopefully they survive the winter.
3,bug off door,"The product seems to be a reliable mesh screen door, it fits well and serves it purpose. the only disappointment i have is the closure, for the price and i thought it would have a more than 1 closure magnet"
5,The perfect dog door,"I have a fenced-in back yard and three years ago, bought one of these to hang in the back door because I didn't want to cut a hole in walls or doors to install a permanent dog door. My idea, of course, was to give the dogs the freedom to come and go as they please, and to ease my role as doorman. From about April to October, the storm door and house door are open whenever practical, and the set-up has worked just as I had hoped. I get very few insects inside, and after some hesitation at first, the dogs are totally comfortable with it. The screen panels hang from an adjustable spring rod, and the magnets both weight it and close it every effectively. This year, after over two years of use, the dogs tore it a little, and I bought another to have in reserve, simply because it's ingenious and effective. As for human use, when my hands are full, I use an elbow or whatever I'm carrying to press against the center, and it opens fine, and closes behind me."
5,Better than the one that I purchased previously,"Good quality and it works well. I have three of these things and they certainly work. I wouldn't use them in an area where there are lots of bugs swarming around (like when I lived in Austin, Texas). However, here in Arizona, they keep out the bugs."
5,Great investment!,We got this screen so we could leave our back door open and not let the bugs in. It works great and is easy to get through and the magnets really help keep the pieces together. It's very wind resistant. We've had some 30+ mph winds recently and there was no problem with the screen falling down. It hasn't yet. I would definitely invest in it again.
4,bug off instant door screen,I have been having big problems with my sliding screen door falling off all the time and a replacement so expensive. Ordered the Bug Off Magnetic Screen Door.Awesome product worked well. The only problem my cat is afraid to go thru it. Go figure!
4,A Great Product,"This is a well made product that looks like it will last a long time, took all of five minutes to install and works better then I expected. Three people that have seen it have ordered their own."
5,delivered as expected,"very easy to install, keeps 98% of the bugs out - still plan to get a screen door - the bug off instant screen is a very good temporary option - once i get the storm door i plan on using the bug off on a different door."
4,Decent solution to a problem,"I didn't want a full sized screen door and so I decided to try this. It works fine. It will let a few bugs in that figure out a way through the middle, but not many. The magnets will generally line up correctly by themselves, but not always. It isn't perfect, but for an inexpensive option that will do a decent job, I'm pretty happy with it."
5,Fantastic Pet Screen Door!!,I was totally surprised by this product. I love this screen! Our dog can go in and out whenever she wants. Another advantage is that it keeps all the bugs out and you can have your back door open all the time...great to get fresh air as well. I love this screen so much that I just recommended it to my girlfriend. She just installed hers and loves it as well. Great product! I highly recommend it!!
4,Bug off screen works well,We bought the screen to allow our dog to come and go as necessary. It works really well for that. It was simple to install and a better option than the screen dor that we used to have. Our dog had continually torn the screen and reapirs were getting too pricy.
1,disappointed,"Great idea didn't work for me, tried it and had to return it. The magnets aren't strong enough and don't cover enough of the entr causing gaps and openings allowing bugs in"
1,Doesn't keep bugs out. Large gaps at seam.,The one main magnet in the center doesn't create a sufficient seal to keep bugs out. Large gap both above and below this magnet leave the interior open to the outdoors.
3,Needs Modification,"Product just okay,but would be better with some upgrades. Hanger is hardly a tension rod as described. Once positioned I had to manually rotate the rod to have it tight from door side to door side. More magnets are needed to keep the center points of the screen tightly closed and to eliminate voids where the two side screens meet at the center. Insects are free to enter courtesy of the screens NOT held together by too few magnets."
2,Bug off insect curtains,"These insect curtains WOULD be great IF they were actually 80"" long as stated in the description. Unfortunately they were 76""' giving bugs a 4"" freeway into my house.Remember: measure twice, cut once."
2,doesn't work nearly as easy as stated,"The screen is too long for our door and there is not way to adjust it. It catches on the bottom door frame and, subsequently, does not close. Also, it has only one weak magnet in the middle and it does not close unless you actually put it together by hand. Still it is better that a regular screen door in the the dogs can come and go but there is always an opening left when they do."
2,60s Leave it to Beaver Wife,"This book doesn't really have recipes like I expected it to have. I thought it would have hamburger helper, ext in it, but instead it has goulash more freezer recipes in it than I would have liked. The recipes seem a little inconvienant due to the cooking and preparation they require."
5,dave@midwestphotopro.com,"HP service center called and worked with me for two weeks replacing parts and uploading software to fix my printer. Thanks Cesar from HPI'm spending another hour trying to load paper into my HP printer, every day it rejects the paper loaded. The process of reloading takes an hour because the printer continues to reject paper rolls. Sheet loaded media is worse. I can't believe HP would sell a product that doesn't work. My frustration with this printer runs so deep I will never buy another HP product of any kind. Dave Jenkins Midwest Photo Pro."
4,3 and 1/2 stars,"I'm not going to revisit the plot basics, which can be seen elsewhere. I found the movie enjoyable but somewhat frustrating because just as I started to get into a character or relationship, the film switched gears and took up another plot line with different characters. Yes, everyone is tied together along the way (or at the end), but a tighter focus on fewer relationships would have allowed for more development and depth. Too much screen time was squandered. Was a UFO subplot necessary? Also, the over the top mother seemed too campy for the basic, overall tone of the film. I felt the film attempted too much and came up a little short."
4,Excellent Second Film by Israeli Director,"We were quite taken by the excellent film making by this director; his second gay film from Tel Aviv. We first viewed it on Netflix, then ordered the copy for our library. Checking out what other films made by Hochner, we were disappointed in his first effort (Bad Boys),but saw remarkable maturity from the first effort to the Antarctica film. Several actors from Bad Boys appear in this superior film; also matured as well! It is sexy, lovely photography, and deserves several viewings!"
3,Mazeltov Story,"A Mazeltov-story from Israel is something between GLBT propaganda and a Jewish version ofNoah's Arcmuch stripped from humor and explicitly.Sometimes, it is simply boring also broadening the features of the Jewish State. And ""Antarctica""-is it a night club characters work for/meet in, or?"
1,Can't take the weather,We received this as a Christmas gift in NCBy the middle of Febuary it has enough cracks in the bowl that it won't hold water.
2,drippers,I was really dissapointed with this product. When installed they would not adjust to pressure and just squirtted into the air.
5,Beautiful Tough little pot,"One of the most frequently used items in our kitchen. I like that Demeyere welds on the handle instead of using rivets. This is a rare feature even with high end stainless cookware. Rivets always require a little extra cleaning. The pot is totally dishwasher friendly. We no longer buy anything that we can't toss into the dishwasher. Life is too short to be scrubbing pots. Additionally, it is probably the most attractive piece of cookware in our collection. It is very easy to maintain and seems like it will last forever. With a modicum of care, your grandkids will be passing this down to their grandkids."
2,Not powerful at all!,"I am disappointed with this fan. It is not powerful and a person cannot feel the fan unless standing directly in front of it. After about 2 hours use, it began making a permanent vibrating noise, which is very disturbing. This fan takes up floor space and is not effective. I do like the fact it can oscillate and has a timer and 3 speeds, even though I always use the high speed."
3,"Symposium papers, of varying quality","This book brings together papers delivered at an American Association for the Advancement of Science symposium in 2002. Several presentations address physics and engineering solutions to the problem of interplanetary flight, with an emphasis on propulsion concepts. Others address social, cultural, psychological, and genetic dimensions of ""generation ships"" in which human societies would exist within large vehicles during voyages lasting hundreds of years. The final paper, by physicist Freeman Dyson, suggests that life and intelligence might exist on the icy bodies of the outer solar system.The quality is very uneven. The science and technology-based papers are the most useful, though many of these ideas have appeared elsewhere. The philosophical commentaries are not very original. This topic deserves a more thorough study, written as a unified whole."
3,i didn't know the ox knew how to write.,it's hard to believe that the ox could write such an awesome book. go ox!
1,Push Eject NOW!,"Do not waist one minute of your time on this trash. This is the classic bait and switch DVD cover that shows a female on the cover who is not even in the movie.Why did I not read some of the other reviews before I sat down to watch this turd ?The story is as bad as the acting and the effects are even worse then that.The only reason to even think about watching this is to make fun of the ""strippers"" in this movie, they are the saddest I have ever seen. Pitiful on all levels."
2,Not what I expected,"This is not your typical funny tromp through the life of a horse lover. There were some practical facts about horses and their care, but none of the humor I was expecting. Everything was very brief so I felt as though ideas weren't developed and there are certainly no characters I felt bonded with."
4,Roch Voisine,"While it is true that Roch has a superb voice and excellent songs the PRICE of his CD's is a bit high wouldn't you say???I want the ""Higher"" CD but it's listed at $29.99 on this website. Is that Canadian dollars?"
5,Higher is Excellent,"The clarity of Roch's voice send shivers up my spine. He did an outstanding job for this album. You must really listen to the message he is sending in ""Tears in my Coffee"" to truly appreciate the song. ""Myriams Song"" will be a wedding day hit and ""Don't Give Up"" is an inspiration to many. Way to go Roch"
5,Temptations' Fans Must Have This DVD,"I have seen the Temptations movie over 30 times. I think I know the dialogue and choreography by heart. Last year, I was lucky enough to see both of the touring groups....one with Otis Williams and the other featuring Dennis Edwards. Both were phenomenal. But my memories and DVD collection were both missing performances by the original members until I ordered this. This is a ""must have"" for all you die hard Temptations fans. The sound and visual quality is excellent and I loved every minute of it. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This DVD has studio versions of hits plus performances that is excellent. If you are a Temptation's fan, Get this DVD."
5,Get Ready: Definitive Performances 1965-1972 [DVD] - The Temptations,I bought this for my mom as a present. She says the video makes her feel that she is sitting right there in the audience listening to a live performance. We both hope that they come out with a second DVD with more performances.
4,temptations almost best,"This a real find for any Tempt fan, I've seen better performances by them but this is the first in a long time with the originals. I hope they will come out with many more dvds with the orignal members Paul,Eddie,David,otis,Melvin.but I'll accept this as a great buy since I haven't seen the performances in a long time.I wish they would add more dvds of old performances I would definitely buy them.Now I have to be careful that I don't order performances that I already have.Someone else suggested there should be a way for us to distinguish which performances we already have so we don't risk getting the same ones twice."
2,Great Temp Performance--Poor quality DVD,"Beware! this DVD's recording quality is very poor. Appears to be videoed from a TV or Movie screen. I first saw this Temptation DVD in a BEST BUY store and had to have it. They were out of copies, so I rented it from Blockbuster and loved it. I was haunted by the stellar Temptation performances as well as the great video detail of the Temps I remember seeing at the Regal Theater in Chicago back in the 60's. When I couldn't find this DVD in the stores I thought I would try Amazon, and am I disappointed. This sorry reproduction of the original DVD is shameful. The faces of the Temps are blurred in their performances, and you can see round edges around the screen indicating this was videoed from another screen. I shall continue my search for the DVD I saw in the stores. The nice thing about this DVD is the music, which you can get on CD's."
4,I love the Temptations,"I love this video. The Temptations is one of my favorite all time musical groups. I just love all the old songs, ""Just my Imagination"", ""My Girl"", etc. I miss all the original group members, Eddie Kendrick and Paul Williams were my favorites. I even watch the movie everytime it comes on television. It was nice taking a stroll back in time."
4,The Temps,"Great quality and it came in 2 days. I was very pleased. Glad I used Amazon and not an outside vender, they take forever."
4,ONE OF THE BEST,"I totally enjoyed this DVD. Even though many of the performances weren't live, the dance moves were real and original. I just wish that someone would have had the vision of recording full live concerts of The Temps and many other R&B groups, back in the day, when they were in their prime."
5,Great showcase of true classic talent,"I heard the a capella version of ""I Wish it Would Rain"" on the radio and decided to get the DVD for my husband as part of his Christmas gift. He said it was one of the best gifts he ever received! The performances are great and the singing is amazing! There's great never-before-seen interviews between the performances, also."
3,Temptations - Get Ready,"Otis Williams' narrative of the DVD is great. Lots of background info. However, I watched the actual performances with mixed feelings. Some were good, others were not as good. Camera angles are way off the mark on some, as explained in the booklet. I remember the Tempts being much more polished and precise than shown in this DVD. Most performances are taken from TV shows. I absolutely love the Temptations, but this DVD left me wanting much more."
3,Tempatations DVD,I loved this DVD of some of the temptations proformances however when I received my DVD it was scratched in a few placesand it skipped over a large part of some of the performances
5,Hypnotizing,I thoroughly enjoyed watching the performances of the Temptations. It took me back to the good ole days where there was good and meaningful music! Wish there had been more performances on the video. Loved it.
5,Charlie Waller,The best bluegrass music there is! His voice is like that of an angel. And the music is phenomenal. Just beautiful!
1,Short and outdated,As this article is only one page and is from 1999 - didn't seem worth a $5.95 purchase to my mind.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.,"Clearly a book written by a couple of career academics. I pity any grad. student who gets evaluated based on his/her ability to digest this crap.If awarding less than one star was an option, I would have used it! Perhaps the attractive cover is worth something."
3,provides comprehensive knowledge,"It provides comprehensive knowledge about formal specification. Though it is a graduate level textbook, it contains information to satisfy the hunger of many curious readers. Nicely utilized in the case studies. Highly recommended."
3,detailed schematic analysis of Z,"This book covers right from from the basics of specification, providing anyone with a smooth learning curve. There is a detailed schematic analysis of Z, which anyone should find it extensively written. Also, the whole industry there is an apprehension about the use of formal specifications and in my belief by using it admirably for the various case studies proves a point or two."
3,decent book,"A very nicely written book, which provides decent exposure to using formal specification. This should be useful for professionals and curious readers who want to get to know what is formal specification. Topics have been supplemented with sufficient case studies as well. Again, going through the pain-staking process of coming up with specification from the Analysis and Design phase should help in gaining good handle of the intricacies of the program."
2,Great Story - poor quality,"When my daughter accidently deleted the HD version of the Champions League game from by DVR, I was hopeful this DVD would be a replacement, especially since the final game is presented in its entirety. Unfortunately, the great Barcelona victory is ruined by poor quality. It's almost like someone slapped these games together and burned them to a DVD at home. I'm surprised such a well run organization would authorize such a low quality product."
4,Beautiful Sound but Rusty...,My friends got this for me for a gift and they are absolutely beautiful!! The sound is just awesome and I love them. My mistake was hanging them where they can get rained on - and now they are beginning to rust. :( SO...I plan to replace them at some point with the same thing - but this time I will hang them further in so they get the wind but not the rain.
3,"Looked nice, but needed repair off the bat!","The center string was twisted around one of the side strings. I had to disassemble, re-string and tied off! They sounds great but now they look a little off balance."
5,"Very nice bells, classy","Really like this purchase. The bells are perfect for any Asian decor in particular but would be lovely in any setting. Subtle yet not just a tinkling sound, very melodic."
5,gorgeous outdoor diversion,"I use this chime at the edge of the porch near an awful view. I am pleased to say it easily diverts attention away from all those power lines onto its own lovely self. I like to swat it as I go by to hear it's sweet chimes as it takes a moderate wind to move it. Well made heavy copper bells, enjoy."
4,Great travel tripod even for big cameras.,"This is an amazing little tripod. Very rigid. works fine with my D70 even with bigger lenses like my sigma 12-24. Incredibly compact when collapsed. If it were 6"" taller fully extended it would be perfect. If you do any sort of shooting while hiking or backpacking you'll love this little guy."
1,Junk do NOT buy,I purchased this product last year and within a few months it was no longer working. I paid $40-50 per unit and bought two. The first went bad after 2 months and the second about a month later. And of course no receipt to prove when/where I purchased it so nothing could be done. I bought a $10 unit to replace it and it has been working fine now for a year. Save your money!!
2,Check color description,I was looking for a neutral cloth and this was very yellow /gold and brown - that's all.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZPPE4/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1,Seriously?!,"I just do not understand the other reviews for this ""comedian"". Simply put, this act is NOT funny. I sat through the entire thing, and never once laughed outloud, or even giggled. The material is unoriginal and cliché. I found myself arriving at the punch lines FAR before he could get there. How do the reviewers find ANY of this funny?! It is quite discouraging that someone like Willie Barcena becomes famous when there are far more talented and undiscovered individuals on the comedy circuit."
4,alright but gets expensive overtime!,"I would not waste money on this product as long as you can get the same job done with Veet type of hair remover, it didn't really retard hair growth at desirable level."
2,Salieri is truly the champion of mediocrity.,"Salieri is truly the champion of mediocrity. If anyone wants to listen to the BeeGees of the eighteenth century, this album will delight the mediocre senses and take you to a place where many have been before."
1,Not worth it,"I was expecting a sequel to the first Skeleton Key, but this was not the case here. This has to be one of the most inane movies I have ever seen!I feel like I totally wasted my money on this one."
1,Skeleton Key 2,"After finally watching The Skeleton key and sitting on the edge of my seat, i was very dissapointed with The Skeleton Key 2. These two movies have nothing in common, and the story line for the second is totally different from the first movie. I couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes of The Skeleton Key 2."
1,poor.,"this movie here look like an movie you film from home, Did not expexct this movie to turn out they way it did. 5 thumbs down."
5,"Love, love, love this!!",One of a few very favorite Christmas cd's. I own over 70 Christmas cd's and this one is getting worn!
2,WOW - I spent $15 on this?,"I purchased this CD expecting a modern interpretation of classic Christmas songs. Unfortunately, the CD falls flat. The best way to describe the music is ""Lounge singers performing in an ABC Christmas special"". An example is ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" by Bethany Dillon. It sounds as if a Marilyn Monroe impressionist is performing the song. And when you think it can not get any worse, David Crowder sings ""Feliz Navidad"", a rendition that is so bad it deserves to be on Saturday Night Live as a comedy sketch.Not every song is a flop. ""O Come, O Come Emmanuel"" by Third Day is a surprising standout. It is creative, innovative, and offers a modern sound to a traditional hymn. The Natalie Grant interpretation of ""Joy to the Word"" and ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" by Rebbecca St. James also deserve honorable mention.But the other 27 songs could be used by the US military to torture enemy combatants."
2,not your traditional christmas music,I was expecting traditional christmas songs and that's why I got the cd. But the songs are done in a modern style and they only slightly resemble the old good traditional christmas songs we all know and love.I was very dissapointed.
2,christian artists change old favorite christmas songs,"Although the talent of the artists is without question, superb..the modern arrangments of the old time christmas songs,is not what I expected."
1,LOST IN SPACE. UNABLE TO RATE!,"I know that this item was sent because the postal service scanned it, but it never made it to my mailbox. I can not give a fair rating for the item or the seller since I never received it. Sorry."
5,My 2 year old loves it. We sing and dance all day!,"My 21 month son loves this video, and the original Toddlers Sing. We have this one in the kitchen, and the other in the car, because Toddlers Sing Playtime is so much fun to get up and dance to. We especially love ""Doing the Hokey Pokey"" and acting out ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain""!"
5,Loads of Fun!,We love this CD! My one-year-old son and three-year-old daughter have a great time dancing every day to it. My daughter knows all the words. The kids on the CD are so funny and still make me chuckle. I would recommend Toddlers Sing Playtime to any one who has energetic kids who love to dance.
2,I Was Disappointed,"I was looking for upbeat music that my toddler could sing and dance to. This CD was not the answer. I was very disappointed with the musical content of this CD and at times I found the music difficult to listen to and almost irritating. Rather than being a CD that leads you to sing along, the music consists of a bunch of toddlers trying to sing together with no lead singer. Two other CD's that my toddler and I enjoy much more are: 1) ""Return to Pooh Corner"" by Kenny Loggins. It is NOT a ""sing and dance"" CD, but more an ""easy listening"" bedtime CD; and 2) If you have a computer, the ""Reader Rabbit Toddler"" audio CD that comes with the software (which is also very good) has some very upbeat and unique learning songs."
3,not as good as toddlers sing,"I bought this tape by accident when trying to get 'toddlers sing' for my mother-in-law and her friends. It is alright. Many of the songs are cute and they are all familiar. But it can not compare with the purely wonderful 'toddlers sing'. I had ordered five copies and did keep one, but I have found that my daughter doesn't really like it that much either. If you are looking for a real GEM get 'toddlers sing'. I give that tape ten stars - five for the kids, and five for the adults. It is fantastic."
4,Toddler Sings - Our kids loved it (and so did we),We got this tape in a library pack for a long road trip. We had a geat time singing all the songs - they are really wonderful. The little kids voices can be pretty irritating (really irritating at times!) but the fun wins out.
5,Cucumber cream,"Very good, not too oily and smell good.. I love this massaging cream for massage at night. I will definitevely recommend to friends."
4,"Queen Helene Cucumber Scented Massage Cream, 15 Ounce","Wish it had a stronger scent of cucumber, other than that it's awesome! It leaves no sticky feeling behind, goes on smooth and feels clean. Softens nicely!"
1,Unreliable company! Will never order from them again.,"I have ordered this massage cream to try the new product.I never recieved it the cream, with no explanation, lost Christmas Gift for someone, who lost business because of whole mess. Was lie about undeliverable address, since address was correct and other items arrived with the same order.Very unhappy with whole situation.Wouldnot reccomend!"
3,It's okay,"I really like the masks by Queen Helene, but this is up on the fence for me. It is light and refreshing, smells good and is really thick, the only complaint that I really have is that it is super hard to take off. You can use it anywhere, I use it on my face and neck area and it works, feels good and cleans your skin but you have to rub hard to wipe it all off."
4,A very funny ROFL book,"Not a novel so much as a series of vignettes; this is a very funny bring-tears-to-your eyes book. Makes you wonder about the transitions from the dedicated stop-the-nazis generation of WWII captured in Catch 22 to the laid-back generation that fought in Vietnam captured here, to the Nazis now fighting in Iraq where all signs of humor and compassion appear to be completely lost."
4,Well worth reading,"I loved this book. It's the first fiction I've seen about Viet Nam that isn't just about the horrors of war. It is Catch-22-like in that it is about some of the absurdities of that war. Very entertaining and well worth reading.Eric T KnightAuthor of Wreckers Gate, Volume 1 of The Devastation Wars"
3,Not very good as an intro or reference,"This book tries, but stumbles and ultimately fails, to provide an intuitive and solid intro to topology. A lack of coherence, motivation, and example makes this book a must-not-have. I would instead recommend Fulton's ""Algebraic Topology"" for a very coherent intro to topics such as homology and cohomology, or Munkres' ""Topology: A First Course"" to learn about general topology."
2,a poor book and not an introduction,"This book is based on an intersting idea -- a direct path to the duality theorem. But it has so many flaws. Definitions are often loose, there are no significant examples, proofs are often unclear. Some proofs used symbols never explicitly defined.There is also a complete lack of motivation.The worst Dover math book I have seen."
1,Snake Oil,"The world needs a good book calling to task all the charlatans out there getting rich by offering advice on everthing from sex to getting rid of problem dandruff. Unfortunately, Tom Tiede's ""Self-Help Nation"" is not up to the task. The book is merely a disjointed collection of screeds against everything and everyone ranging from Thomas Jefferson, to Christians to modern newspapers to that always popular target--baby boomers. The book should be entitled, ""Tom Tiede's Pet Peeves: a Self-indulgent Monologue."" The book's cover promises readers an antidote to the ""snake oil peddlers who are sapping our nation's soul."" Instead, Tiede simply offers his own brand of snake oil in a package that promises an antidote but contains only colored water."
2,Well-intentioned; Similar in ways to www.LiveReal.com,"Self-help, when it's taken seriously, can often become a seductive, perplexing, mind-spinning jungle. I've been there and learned the hard way. I agree with most of the other reviewers of this book - this book is well-intentioned, it's raw, it's a sorely needed message, and it doesn't quite finish the job.There are some parallels to a promising web site I've found, www.LiveReal.com. It's one thing to criticize self-help authors (which is pretty easy to do); it's another thing to offer valid and even better alternatives.The key ingredient, which LiveReal nails, is that the issues addressed by self-help are intimately linked to keeper issues, and the ways that various issues are interconnected. For example, self-esteem is connected to relationships is connected to spirituality is connected to . . . and so on.While LiveReal is also pretty rough and raw around the edges, in my mind, it's still the best I've found yet to do the whole job in one place."
2,Delightfully hostile....,"...makes for a great subtitle, but it's really an oxymoron, as this book proves. I picked up this book because I distrust the self-help genre, and this sounded like a fun way to have my prejudices confirmed.It's not fun. You feel like you've paid good money to listen to your grouchy old uncle complain for hours on end. He comes off as nasty and self-righteous. An analysis of why people turn to these books would be interesting, this book-length scolding is not.Don't read self-help books, but don't read this one either. It's a good idea, but Tiede simply does not pull it off."
1,Disgusting what they put in dog food.,"Don't buy this dog food, it's pure junk. Full of corn, by-products and other bad ingridients. Stay away from all purina products, they are not healthy."
3,Don't be so hard on this book,"Evan Morgan was unduly hard on this book. True the typsetting is bad, but its not unreadable. I learned a lot from this book. It develops matrix group theory from very few prerequisites. I have one complaint: the problem sections seem unrelated to the chapters, but all in all I learned a lot from this book and found it very helpful."
1,don't buy this book,"The typeface of the book is courier and appears to have been originally written on a typewriter and then photocopied. This is a nuisance. The notation they use is terrible (thanks to the typewriter). More importantly, the explanantions and proofs of ideas and theorems are not good at all. I think the book was copied directly from some professors lecture notes (for a course he has taught 30 times already) which makes every thing very cryptic. Good luck learning anything from this book."
2,Poor instructions,Hard to follow and not very much instruction for the price. It was close to $40.00. The DVD was dissapointing to me.
5,A wonderful recording!,TRACK LISTING:1. Journey To The Centre2. Buffalo Wings3. Songflower4. Terrestris5. Water's Edge6. Bell7. Bright8. Serenity9. Camera In A Bag
4,Bujold is not at her best in this book.,"Don't get me wrong, Bujold is a fantastic writer--far better than most. However, her 3 most recent offerings, The Hallowed Hunt and The Sharing Knife parts 1 and 2, are not, to me, even comparable to her previous books. I cannot give her less than 4 stars for these, but I am disappointed--her work normally rates 10."
2,Not one of her action books,"I gave this book 2 stars because Ms. Bujold's writing style is wonderful, as in all of her books. The book itself is very disappointing. The first 65% or so of the book takes place entirely in the main character's head. He is trying to understand the precipitating event for the story. As I said, it's very well-written, but it goes on and on. When some action does finally take place, it unfolds at such a leisurely pace that the reader has no problems seeing what is going to happen."
3,"Decent story, but not connected to previous books","""The Hallowed Hunt"" is the third book from Lois McMaster Bujold in what I thought was a new fantasy series; however, this story doesn't involve any previous characters. The only common element is the theological system, but that even presents new material that further complicates the system.The story presents a set of characters that submit their wills to their god's so they can explore the mysterious death of a prince that appears to be tied up with an old magic system.I knocked my rating down a star because it felt like the end of book two was going to draw us deeper in Chalion, but this book takes us down a completely different path. I knocked my rating down a second star because it didn't feel like any of the major characters were in any real jeopardy.Overall, this was a readable story and ""series"". Good, but not great."
3,I expect better!,"I love book 1 of this series, found book 2 lacking and book 3 is just average. Maybe because the writer is Bujold and I have higher expectation from her than any other writers. The main characters just do not lift off and the plot drags in some chapters, and at times confusing. I have the impression that Bujold has breaks during her writing and did not get all her thoughts together on this book. The beginning of the story is intriguing and promising and the ending highly imaginative. It is a pity that the in-betweens are at times slow and disjointed. Regreted buying the hardcopy because Book 3 is not one I will return to, unlike Bujold's Miles series and Book 1 of the Chalion series"
2,Disappointing novel from a terrific author,"Lois McMaster Bujold has done something with this novel that I did not think she was capable of doing: She wrote a boring book! The characters are flat, especially the point-of-view character, who does not seem to have any control over what's going on around him and doesn't try to do anything about it. The story itself is almost impossible to follow and, when you figure it out (I think I did anyway), you don't really care. There is one great scene, however, that almost redeems the entire book--when the lead character meets one of the gods, you feel like you're right there. Too bad the entire novel did not have that powerful writing."
2,Seriously disappointing,"After an excellent start, this series went downhill - to the extent that this (third) book is probably not even worth reading.Set in a land far to the east, beyond Darthaca, Chalion is barely even mentioned in this book - and what made the first two books good doesn't appear either.The characters are wooden, with none of them truly believable. The land (The Weald!?) seems half-formed and isn't very well realised. Worst of all is the new magic system. The whole 'animal-spirits-bonded-to-human-spirits' thing didn't make the slightest bit of sense.Stick to the first two books of this series and forget about this clunker."
2,A disappointment.,"Laura Shumar read my mind when she posted her review.Bujold is by far my favorite writer, living or dead. Hers is the only fiction, other than Shakespeare's, that I read with pencil in hand so that I can mark special passages. I have read all of her books multiple times, with the exception of ""Diplomatic Immunity."" ""The Hallowed Hunt"" will now join it on the far end of the shelf.I will still buy her next book as soon as it is available, but with trepidation."
3,Maybe I just had too-high expectations,"I expected this book to be from Ista's point of view, and was greatly disappointed to find that the POV character was a man called Ingrey. That disappointment lasted, unfortunately, though it is no fault of Bujold's that I loved Ista so much and had been looking forward to this book because I'd wrongly assumed it would feature her!I finished the book, anyway, and it was good reading. I stopped in the middle to go read another book I'd wanted to read more, and the fact that I could do that means this book is at most 3 stars."
3,Not at all up to Bujold's best,"I eagerly awaited ""The Hallowed Hunt,"" and bought it on the first day it was available. While it opens strongly, the main characters engage with no moral dilemmas and do not grow over the course of the novel, in contrast with ""Paladin of Souls"" or ""The Curse of Chalion."" The most interesting characters, disappointingly, are the supporting characters, of whom I look forward to seeing more.For me, this is probably the least rewarding of all of Bujold's novels, including ""Spirit Ring."" Still, she does know how to write a page turner, and that skill serves the novel well. 3 (disappointed) stars."
5,very enjoyable,"I'd read the prior 2 books in this series and expected to be less impressed with this one after reading the other reviews here. Now that I've read it I'd say the negative reviews are too picky. This is a great book.IMO, this seems to read faster than the prior two, so you might think it's 'lighter' or less complex. Perhaps, but it has a well-developed set of characters, plenty of plot turns to keep you interested, yet with smooth reading. I liked how these characters and the issues they were facing were put into the same universe as the prior 2 books, yet they were separate enough to be different and interesting.I picked it up on vacation and got hooked quickly. Give it a try!"
5,A superb book by a superb author,"This third book in the ""Chalion"" or ""Five Gods"" series requires a bit more thought to appreciate than the previous books. Or maybe it's that it takes more effort to identify with the protagonist at first. I strongly recommend making the effort, since this story is wonderful, highly re-readable, and a little philosophical (what is the nature of leadership?). Chalion is mentioned only in passing, but since this story takes place hundreds of years before the previous two books, that should be okay. Just don't expect to hear from any of the human characters from the previous books. The Bastard and the Brother do turn up here, quite a bit in fact. For the rest, get the book! It's worth your time."
3,Pretty Good,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Bujold's -- I've read most of the Miles Vorkosigan novels at least twice, some particular elements of the series many more times... I thought Curse of Chalion was great, but I was a little disappointed in Paladin of Souls ... This book was not as good as Book 1, but definitely better than Book 2. It had quite a few interesting twists along the way..."
1,CORRECTION of previous review,"Correction: ""High Powered Rappers"" is NOT really on this CD. What they have listed is ""High Powered Rap"" a not quite 2 minute demo of the song before it was added to it's music and such. The song ""High Powered Rappers"" was released independently on a 12"" in about 1979 and is HIGHLY rare. None of the crash crew's songs really compare to this old school classic. The only reason I got this CD was for that one song, very let down to find that the song isn't really on the CD at all. So if you are like me and are looking for this song, KEEP LOOKING because it's VERY hard to find (I'm still looking myself."
5,The Crash Crew,"True Old School. The song ""High Powered Rappers"" on this CD is worth the purchase price alone. The same music as ""Freedom"" by grandmaster flash with kazoos added, this song was HOT back in the day. Very hard to find also. If you like real old school (like sugar hill, granmaster flash, etc..) your collection isn't complete without this."
1,Total Disappointment,This item contains excellent material in a format that is totally impractical and virtually unusable. It is a photostat reproduction of the original in a format that is too small for practical purposes. In many instances the copy is so poor that it is hardly readible. Do not waste your time with this one!
3,Advanced,"My wife is self teaching herself how to play the keyboard. I thought this book my help her. Well it confussed her. It was too advanced. My fault, not hers, I tryagain."
2,A fair book at best,"Overall I was fairly disappointed with this book. I was bothered by the American centrism, but was much more annoyed with all the subtle historical slights that turn what might otherwise have been a decent historical summary into a biased work that has a clear agenda and doesn't seriously consider alternatives to it."
3,Not that great,This Idiots guide was my biggest dissapointment. I really wanted it to break down the communist manifesto and explain it but it didn't. Wouldn't really recommend it.
5,"On The Road w,Charles Kuralt",I own both Set 1 & 2 and recommend them both. These individual clips were remembered when they were first broadcast and that is why they were purchased.My wife and I have traveled via automobile through 45 states and have 'hit' not only the 'tourist' spots but the small 'On The Road' type spots as well.'nuff said.
5,On the Road with Charles Kurait: Set 2,"We bought this for my father. He enjoyed the first set, and he was very excited to get the second set. I'm sure he will want them all."
3,first wrist rest I've ever kept,"I've never been able to use a wrist pillow while I typed before - they just irritated me and took up valuable desk space - but for some reason this one doesn't bug me. Beyond that there's not much to say. It's pretty firm, doesn't slide around on my desk, and is black."
5,Swiss musicianship at its best!,"This is the most representative example of what Mr. Eicher musical talent has to offer to music lovers whether or not they are acquainted with swiss music. This album is highly recommendable, the track list is just brilliant just as the rest of his music. Whether or not you speak French, German and/or Italian, this is music worth listening to. Switzerland's finest, and highly addictive as well!"
4,3rd carafe!,"Our 'original' carafe, despite the usual handling bumps and jolts, lasted a good 4 years! The Krups F15BOG (black top/handle) replacement, however, only 18 months. This is our 3rd carafe; we opted for the F15BOH. Same Krups everything BUT for the white top/handle AND amazingly $ less expensive than the previous unit! At 4 weeks of use and counting we do realize that the whites will eventually show stains more; we're just hoping the carafe lasts long enough to match the coffeemaker's."
3,Thin Glass is Bound to Break,"I've stood by Krups coffee makers for years - and this is the first time I'm holding my breath! The end result is good coffee, but the means to that end is a daily hope - that the thin glass pot won't break when I set it down on my granite counter top!"
4,Easy Cleaning,This lunch bag is light and seems pretty durable (my son uses it for his snack bag at school daily). The interior can be pulled inside out for easy cleaning and drying.
3,OK,"Got this textbook for my Inorganic lab class. It's an alright book, but there are many errors and it seems like the authors ramble on in some places and don't explain things too well. It may be easier to use for people who have a better understanding of inorganic chemistry, but I found it kind of difficult to follow."
2,"too broad, even for general understanding","This book gave no specifics or real depth on many of the topics presented. Clear evidence of this is seen with the end of the chapter problems, which are repeatedly unsolvable when the text is used exclusively. On numerous occasions I had to go to other texts (such as Miessler's 4th ed.) in order to properly solve and understand complex problems/theories.Further this book is very heavy and rather cumbersome for the mobile/bike-riding student.One good thing is that all answers are given for practice and end of chapter problems which is helpful.I would only recommend this book as a supplement to other more comprehensive texts and at $60 (used), it's not too overpriced to add to a collection but not necessary either, IMO."
3,Must agree with most of the first reviewers...,"Atkins presents quite a bit and there are some flaws (the group section...), but, they nice thing about this book is that it presents quite a bit on the mechanism of reactions and doesn't seem encyclopedic (see my review for Cottons ""Basic Inorganic Chemistry, 3rd Edition"") A very good reference. If I were going to teach a two part course in inorganic (maybe one day...) then I would have the first section be mainly based off of Cotton and Wilkinson and then the second section based off of Spessard's ""Organometallic Chemistry"". I must strongly say that this is a good comprehensive presentation of the subject which gets into the real down and dirty on the subject..."
2,A Book with many errors,"As a Chemistry-majored student, I am sorry that you use this ALL-Bugs book as your textbook. There are many errors and miss in it. Some important topics, like D,Id,A,Ia mechniasm, this book will mislead your understanding. Although its level is very simple and basic, but you have better accompany it with other books, such as Douglas's C&C of I. Chem. It errors is cover exercise and text. So terrible!!! :("
1,Not a good book !,"A very blur introductory to inorganic chem. Everything just popped out of the blue without any proper explanation. Overall, buying this book does not worth the money. Cotton wrote a better book."
2,Atkins slaughters another chemistry subfield.,"Having muddied the waters of physical chemistry, Atkins proceeds to write this low-grade inorganic text. This book is laughable next to the Huheey, Keiter et al text. This text is also far below the Miessler & Tarr text.This book is printed in large text, in black & white, with some line art. It has no more pages than M&T but is twice as thick. Its descriptions are shoddy and the explanations lacking.Do yourself a favor and pick up the Miessler and Tarr text and leave this book alone."
2,An Undesirable Text,"For me, the utility of a chemistry text is defined in simple terms. Does it help me complete the homework assignments? Does it explain things in a way that my professor does not? Does it stand alone, apart from the instruction of my professor?I took an Inorganic course to fill a deficiency and so I bought this book. I found it to be very disappointing. The explanations of key concepts (such as term symbols and crystal field theory) is lacking and the problems that the text works out seem esoteric and too terse for someone trying to connect the dots.I like the Tarr and Mieslier text better."
1,Find a different textbook....,"I wanted to be fair after suffering through Physical Chemistry by Peter Atkins last year, but this book is every bit as horrible as I feared. My instructor has offered to give two extra credit points for every mistake we find, and I accumulated 8 points this morning while working in Chapter 4. At this rate I won't have to do anything else in the class and will get a solid A. Sadly, though, I will have learned NO inorganic chemistry in the meantime."
1,"errors, errors, errors,","The Preface of the THIRD edition (1999) states "" We have taken particular care to ensure that the text is free of errors"". If this isn't misleading, I don't know what is. The books is loaded with errors, misprints, and poorly worded sentenses. Many of the imperfections are carried over from the previous edition but new ones also appear. No students should be required to buy this book until a clean second printing is available.The second edition (1999) of Miessler and Tarr contains errors but at least the solutions manual comes with a list of ""the corrections that are most important for student use of the text""."
3,"Good reference book, but......","This is an excellent reference book, but a poor text for students learning about inorganic for the first time. The discussion (Chapter 4) on molecular symmetry and point groups is INSANE. The prof who taught the course provided a number of supplementary materials on point groups, probably because this chapter is so flawed. The second part of the text is somewhat better than the first... Personally, I learned a lot from the discussions in the Guide to Solutions manual that accompanies the text; if I hadn't had that, I'd have definitely received a lower grade in the class. Overall, an average-level textbook."
1,confusing way of presenting concepts without proper emphases,"Some important points in a chapter are only explained in several lines or not explained clearly. A full understanding of the concepts and chemical process cannot be achieved after reading the book. And some equations in the book jump out suddenly without being explained, which makes them much less convincing and makes the readers confused. This is not suitable for a common understanding process and a mechanical memorisation of the formulas and concepts is not good for understanding. For the chapter on quantum mechanics, a physics textbook is much better than this book. The concepts in a physics book are much more precise and rigorous than those in this book."
5,Pink Floor Mats,I ordered these pink floor for my daughter-in-law. They are beautiful. I thought they would look cheap but to my surprise that look amazing.
2,Less Hawaiian than I was hoping for,I was anticipating more Christmas-themed Hawaiian music. It's pleasant enough but not exactly what I was hoping for. I would have enjoyed more carols with a Hawaiian twist.
2,ONLY a new song combined with 2 pre-released stories,"I purchased this for my kids for Christmas thinking it was a new story, but instead it was only a new song about Bob lending a helping hand and then two previously-released stories (Lyle the Kindly Viking and Big River Rescue) both of which we already had. I find that very misleading. I paid around $10 for a new song!!! How disappointing! Buyer beware!"
5,Clear and Concise - No Better Way to Put It,"I agree with ""A reader , April 30, 1997."" Microsoft doesn't have to share its style guide with the world, but I'm glad they did. Sure, this is not a bible or a book of rules, but it gets you through when you're at a loss for words. The definitions they use reflect standard and common usage. Isn't that the way we all want to write? Clear and concise, no better way to put it."
5,An excellent companion reference.,"The Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications is an excellent companion to a more traditional Manual, such as the Chicago Guide. The work is well written in an easy-to-read format, using clear, concise language. The accompanying CD is a terrific addition, as it provides a way to read the manual in a quick, online manner. The e-book Microsoft Press Computer Dictionary is a great bonus."
4,Carmen triumphant,"This is a beautiful movie exploring the courage of a woman surrounded by confused, helpless, or cowardly men. Carmela during the Spanish Civil War faces down the fascists and turns the tables on them in a play they thought would ridicule their victims, but which Carmela forces to the logical exposition of the basic cowardice of fascists (from Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini to George W. Bush and Ariel Sharon), whose courage consists in the murder of unarmed opponents, like the heroic actress."
5,Burguesía y resistencia.,"En esta historia, enmarcada en la Guerra Civil Española, donde los Franquistas dominaban las manifestaciones artísticas no del agrado de ellos, encontraron la censura y el rechazo, manifiesto en la osbstrucción y el abuso. La resistencia que apenas se podia sostener, enfrentaba el fusilamiento o la desaparición imprevista. Carmela representa esa resistencia. Es la voz del pueblo que no se resigna a abandonar lo que cree y lo que vive, su arte, como expresión sublime del ser humano. Esta película es una de las mejores muestras de la lucha sostenida entre las clases dominantes de la burgesía y los trabajadores del arte."
1,No spanish language at all,"""Ay, Carmela!"" is a great film. But this DVD version is all dubbed to ITALIAN with no Spanish language option (the product description is wrong)."
5,"¡Ay,Carmela!","Even if you do not know a lot about the Spanish Civil War, you will enjoy this incredible movie about that time period in history. There is comedy, tragedy, pathos, suspense and wisdom in this story of a piece of the war as seen through the eyes of two traveling entertainers who happen to land up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film crescendos to an ending of hope, believe it or not. It does not matter if you understand Spanish, the subtitles are excellent and the performances are superb. I have even used this film for an AP Spanish class of high school seniors and it left a lasting impression on them!"
3,Not one of their best,"I agree with several earlier reviews. I actually enjoyed the prelude to the book more than I did the book itself. I felt that the plot and characters were redundant, too similar to previous books, but I did enjoy the setting, and, as always, I love the detail the Gears add to their books to make you feel that you are there, living in the envronment, and are experiencing the intimate connection with the earth that so many people have lost today.I do wish the Gears would give up the heroines with the heart-shaped faces. That has become a personal joke for me, and an ""ah, LOOK! She must be a heroine!"" snicker. I have a private wager whenever I start one of their books that has to do with the page number where the first heart-shaped face bombshell will show up."
3,too political,"I have enjoyed several of the books in this series in the past, but when I finished this one I felt disappointed. There were too many double crossings, alliances, agendas, etc. I also felt like some of the story lines were just dropped. There seemed to be so much time invested in Ecan and then no great resolution. Who was Coyote? Dzoo never did anything exciting. I managed to finish the book, but I wasn't impressed."
1,dissapointed,I was also dissapointed with this book...I own and have read all the people series and was looking forward to another addition...I found the plot watery and filled in with way too much graphic violence and way too much sex....I realise that it was a violent time but the Gear's have managed to show in other novels the elevation of the social and spiritual nature of the First Peoples....Another real problem was the book itself....printed on paper so cheap it curls and the smell of inferior paper and ink has caused me to toss many other such inferior products....I guess Forge just thought we would buy anything by the Gear's and they were right.....this time....Next time I'll wait for the paperback and hope its on a better quality paper and printed with a good quality ink....
1,Not for me.,"This book came to me via a recommendation.Sad to say, I wasted an evening trying to slog through the story. The black and white/good v. evil of the characters just left me flat. The violence was way overdone, IMHO. A little of this kind of graphic inhumanity goes a long way.The sex scenes were predictable and almost sophomoric.The history lesson -- at least to me -- got lost under the weight of the preachy political overtones.I won't be reading any more of this series. Even though I loved Jean Auel's CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, I just didn't ""get"" this one."
1,halmRK,"iF YOU CANT FIND ANYTHING GOOD TO WRITE ABOUT DEALER, DONT WRITE ANYTHING. SOME PEOPLE ARE HONEST SOME ARNT. JEAN LECHNER"
2,"stupid, conceited, arrogant",It is impressive that an author of an excellent book Vernon god little can write something that bad. There are no redeeming qualities in this book.
1,DBC Pierre's broken book,"This was one of the worst books I've read. The plot is ridiculous and goes nowhere, the dialog is dull and repetitive and all the characters but Ludmila loathsome one-dimensional caricatures (she's a likable one-dimensional caricature). If this wasn't bad enough, the book ends with a gruesome scene in which a central character is raped which appears to have been included only because the author had run out of ideas. I felt guilty for giving this book away rather than throwing it out."
1,Very disappointing,"The storyline fails to hold any interest at all, but the worst aspect of this book is that every single character has the same personality. They are all cynics, whose every word drips with aggressive sarcasm as they interact with one another. One or two sarcastic cynics as characters in a book can make it amusing. Having all characters take on this kind of persona makes it merely tiresome. The blurb on the back of the book led me to hope I might find some interesting social criticism of the exploitation of people in developing countries by lecherous, wealthy foreigners. Sadly, the book never rises to such lofty heights."
5,Best book about Toyota PD,"This is the third book I've read about Toyota and by far the best one. I'm an engineering manager and found dozens of simple, new ideas in this book. This is a very thorough & practical guide to the inside workings of Toyota's PD system. There are many examples and sufficient details that you can easily understand them and also try to implement them in your own organization."
5,"""The Book""","What can I say? It's the Bible, Torah and Koran all rolled up into one on the Linux Kernel...""the"" authority."
2,No inotify coverage ???,I was browsing the index for the new edition and lots of topics fail to appear. One I was especially interested is inotify. Kinda odd that it doesn't make the index.PHPTR has also put out some kernel books and they were disappointing.
4,Lots of information!,"This book has a ton of information about the workings of the Linux Kernel.It is also somewhat hard to read and follow, I often have to reread sections of this book.I find it best complimented with Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love."
5,The comments needed by the Linux code,"These are the comments needed to understand Linux code, very helpful and thorough. The authors are knowledgeable, and explain the material well."
3,cute bird feeder,"sometimes has trouble keeping lid on, but for the price I didnt expect alot.If you buy one, remember to fill it HALF way and the lid will stay on fine. pretty flower design."
2,Better books out there,"And there certinly are better books out there on Air Force One. Most notably, the Jerald F. terHorst book The Flying White House, which is unfourtunatly out of print, but get it if you can. Chitester makes an attempt at giving the reader a look into what goes on with the presidency and Air Force One, but instead gives the reader a boring, ""tour-guide"" feel to the book that seems as redundant and glossy as a DisneyWorld host. Chitester's book never gets off the ground, and when reading, makes one feel like air-sickness isnt such a bad idea."
1,Dont jusge this book by its cover,"The book explained little of Air Force One, or how it deals as a flyiny White House. Its a lot of small mittle tales about this guys life for two years."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting more about the personalities who made up the entourage that accompanied the president in his travels. Instead the book read like a daily log of destinations, and travel accommodations. I admit I have only read 80 pages, but that is all the time I will invest in it."
1,One of the worst books I've ever bought,"This is one of the rare books I reget spending the money for. Ken was more or less only writing about what he had to eat and with whom he was underway. If your interested in Air Force One as a ""plane and president buff"" then this book is definitely *** not *** what you want to have on your bookshelf/bed side table/in your travel luggage."
4,Nothing scandalous about this one...It's Just Plain Good!,"Ken Chitester gives a top notch behind the scenes account of what it's really like to work in the White House. Unfortunately this aspect of the job has been overlooked in recent headlines. As President Clinton's former news analyst, Chitester is clearly a keen observer. He combines these skills with a quirky sense of humor to produce a work that's both entertaining and factual. I really good balance. If I can stuff this book in a stocking, I know what I'm giving for Christmas."
1,Big Letdown,"I found this book to be poorly edited and very repetitive. If your looking for some inside stuff on the President and behind the scenes stories, read something else, you won't find it here. There is a constant repetition of ""we board the plane, we eat, watch a movie, land, go to the hotel, sleep, I get up early and print the news clips, and deliver them to everyone on the list."" There's nothing more in this book. The author does provide vivid detail on every meal and article of clothing he wore, for some strange reason. Chitester has absolutely nothing to say which is in the least bit controversial about anything. I consider myself a junkie for this type of subject matter and after one chapter I was bored to death. In regards to my comment about editing, there were many repetitions in the text from one paragraph to the next i.e., the book constantly repeated peoples' titles in perenthesis with almost every mention of the person's name. I will try again with Stephanopolis or Isikoff."
2,Aboard Air Force One -or- Lunch with Ken Chitester,"Ken Chisteter has three good things going for him. He is from Indiana. He graduated from Indiana University. He is a Democrat and worked for a great President. He is not, however, the gifted writer one would expect from the Ernie Pyle School of Journalism. Chitester's book, while bearable, is one of the worst ""insider"" stories I have ever read. Ken IS an insider, and it is obvious that he enjoys this role. Unfortunately, he spends more time telling readers what he ate for lunch than what he did for the President. If you care about the Presidency, don't read this book. If you are interested in the menu aboard Air Force One - this is the text for you."
3,Somewhat Interesting; Not What I Expected,"Ken presents a unique perspective from life inside the White House as a staffer and traveler on board Air Force One. What's interesting is that he shows warts and all--and his disillusionment is not hidden. After about 20 pages, I kept saying, ""Yeah, we know you're tired, it's been a long day, yada, yada, yada."" Was too much of a travel diary to be very interesting or present new information. Ken's ""behind the scenes"" stories are written as only someone who's been there can, but probably are overdone. I'm not sure what the point of the book was beyond the first 20 pages or so. That said, I'm glad though that he took the time to write it--cynical as it was. By the way, SAM 26000 and SAM 27000 are military versions of the Boeing 707, not 737 as stated in several parts of the text. These types of editoral errors are irritating. Also, the pictures used could have been more interesting and more of Air Force One."
2,still faulty ...,"apart from the fact that even the revised edition still contains minor but embarassing errors (e.g. Thieves' Highway credited to Nicholas Ray in one place), i was even more astonished to find exact phrases from other sources in this book, e.g. descriptions of features of actors Edmund O'Brien and Charles McGraw taken from Bruce Crowther's book on film noir. Stephen's book needs intense reworking though, to be honest, i doubt that i will ever see one."
1,"A joke to the Marines who served with ""The Walking Dead""","The piece of garabage don't even rate. I served with the Marine Outfit known as ""The Walking Dead"" or The 1st Bn. 9th Marines. This movie is an insult to the name of the brave Marines who fought and payed the ultimate price for there country and Corp. This Movie ( what I saw of it ) was the biggest nothing ever put on film. If you want the true story of the ""Walking Dead"" and believe me there is a hell of a story, then have some film maker get with the Marines who fought for the 1st Bn, 9th Marines. It will surpass any Vietnam era Movie including ""We Were Soldiers"", ""Hamburger Hill"" or ""Platoon""."
1,The Walking Dead,"It is a crying shame that the producers of this piece of crap chose to use this title. First Battalion Ninth Marine Regiment nicknamed ""The Walking Dead"" has been done a tremendous discredit by having their name associated with such Hollywood garbage. Read the book instead and don't waste one penny on this junk. The real story of 1/9 would make a tremendous movie."
4,walking dead again,"once more into the breach we go is my motto I believe to my view that the movie was great to a point. Semper Fi, Mac!"
4,Walking Dead,"This movie is about a black army platoon who thinks they have gone on a secret military operation but, are really decoys...So they are not the hunters they are the hunted...All of these black men came from diffrent backrounds ..so that creates tension through the entire film..All around good movie..."
1,It was the worst movie ever made!!!,"Not only was it boring, it did not have anything to do with the fighting part of the war. It was a bunch of flashbacks, which in my opinion, are the worst kind of movies; but these flashbacks had absolutely nothing to do with the war... it dealt with the men's lives way before they entered the war and I felt it was really stupid! Even my dad, who was in the war, turned the movie off and walked away."
4,Nice book - missing some history,"Would have given this five stars, but the one piece of Z history I was really looking for (1978 280Z - Black Pearl Limited Edition) was completely skipped over. Other than that - there is plenty of good reading!"
5,"Excellent book ,easy to use and whenever you need it you can easily take it whit you","Good for beginners and very useful for experienced collectors to consult , I would also add that it is very easy to date coins using this book ,this fact adds even more interest and motive to collect roman coins. Also this handbook also gives tips for coins which were issued in special occasions such as visits to provinces by emperor or victories in campaigns or famous buildings build by emperors etc."
5,Katy rules!,"I've been a fan of Katy Moffat for more than 25 years. Last Saturday I had the opportunity to see her in a very intimate setting in San Diego. In perfect voice, Katy's performance was flawless. Her set showcased many original tunes as well as covers by John Hiatt and Bonnie Raitt. It's mysterious to me that a performer of Katy Moffat's caliber is not better known while so many lesser performers are all of the airwaves."
1,dreadful in every respect,"I happen to like b movies; I admit it. I'm quite willing to overlook the low end nature of many of these films for the sake of entertainment. Roger Corman's sci-fi quickies from the 50's and 60's come to mind., but while Corman's efforts were often greater than the sum of their parts, these two turkeys have absolutely nothing to recommend them. Wooden acting, shoddy production values and leaden pacing add to the misery for both flicks. ""Year 2889"", by the way, is a note for note remake of Corman's 1955 film ""The Day the World Ended"". I suppose a fairer comparison might be to Ed Wood's so terrible it's funny ""Plan nine from outer space"", but while that movie is good for a few unintended laughs, these two films are the cinematic equivalent of novacaine."
2,"It's Alive ""or did it really happen""","A gold digger Greely (Bill Truman) is disinvested of his gold but in the process discovers a new friend. His friend (also Thurman) has a nasty overbite and has a voracious apatite for people that have stilted and contrived dialog. Like the proverbial spider he invites people with no outside ties such as Leila and Norman Sterns (Shirley Bonne, Corveth Ousterhouse) into his home and introduces them to his friend. Looks like a nosy paleontologist (Tommy Kirk of ""Mars Needs Women"" fame) is approaching and must also be disposed.Can the paleontologist convince Greely to display his friend?Will the only cute female Leila chose the odd smiling Greely over his friend?Will the sarcastic, uncaring, and snotty Norman get free or become the appetizer?Stay toned and do not fall asleep or you may be next."
3,its alive?/dy wrld ended remake.,"everything just barely ok as far as the entertainment of ITS ALIVE xcept needs more personal monsta story/action, and its face is too fake. acting good, best by the bella character, cool to see tom kirk here. was sad when bella had """"to go"". bill thurman-the madman was a craze dum mean trip. this is prob. 1 of lare's"" buchanan only best and orig. film. it was 'bout time. YEAR2889 not as good as the orig.-day world ended."
2,Twice The Ineptitude!...,"A Larry Buchanan double feature is sort of like two massive blows to the cranium. You're bound to be stunned, and may never fully recover! IT'S ALIVE! begins w/ one of the most ridiculous bits of intro narration ever recorded! Guaranteed to astonish! An annoyingly mean man and his idiot wife stumble upon a hillbilly madman and his pet monster. Of course, the big reptile must be fed. Unfortunately, the creature's appearance is not very impressive. An aging, almost unrecognizable Tommy Kirk co-stars. IN THE YEAR 2889 is Buchanan's imbecilic remake of Roger Corman's DAY THE WORLD ENDED. It features another cavalcade of horrendous actors and even worse dialogue.On the up side, the mutant monster is a laugh riot! This twosome is a shortcut to deep, imeasurable suffering!..."
4,Obi Wan and the F Word,"This was very interesting. We got the 10 series set from Amazon Canada. My wife and I enjoyed it alot. Ewan is of the most likable of the famous, and it was my vicarious journey. It could have been very educational, but we had to watch it without the kids due to the F word. Sometimes they bleeped, sometimes not. Very unfortunate."
5,adventure ride,I recommend this for anyone who rides motorcycles and thinks they would like an adventure.SR
2,Boring !,"Sadly, the adventurers believed we'd rather see their grimaces, smiles and bare bottoms on screen than the faces and landscapes of the places visited. Would have been great without the ""all about me"" attitude!"
1,From a World Traveler's Perspective: Boring!,"The first part is so boring about them preparing for the trip. You won't learn anything about the countries they visit. It is not for travelers! Maybe it is for motorcycles enthusiasts. Thank goodness I never bought it, only saw it on youTube. Watch Michael Palin or anybody else!"
3,meh ! ....,"after discovering they not only got free BMW bikes, chase vehicles and camera crews, and extra help here and there - it takes away from the adventure doesn't it ?as an avid motorcyclist myself, planning long trips, I have to wonder how they would have done without all this help - my guess is they would not have made it.fun to watch - but always knowing they were being coddled, never truly making it on their own ... watch it but also read Jupiter's Travels and many other RTW types who really did it on their own !"
2,This cut down edition is disappointing,I really liked the original series.I owned the original series but loaned it out and it was lost. So I bought this as a replacement. I saw that there were different versions and thought I had picked the correct one because it said it was the complete set. Wrong. I really enjoyed the original and do not understand why it would be edited down. What is missing is the small talk that is normal. I felt that the original release made it feel like you were really along for a trip that most of us will only do vicariously through Ewan and Charlie.
3,Didn't get it... : (,The seller was so nice and let us know that the dvd had been eraised. I am so glad that they checked it and didn't just send it out blank.Would purchase from this person again.
5,Long Way Round,"Hi, A friend told me about this DVD & the book & said I would like it. He was right, I loved it! I love adventure & the DVD had lots of that."
5,Good Surprise,"Long Way Round is really a good surprise, i thought that was a simple movie, but they really did the trip and suffer and solve all the problens with a very good humor."
5,I want more! LOL Love this series!,"PRO'sMan, I watch this over and over and over and over! Dunno why... I just do. I ride myself but man they take it to the next level in distance.CON'sIt ended :( Should have had about 20 to 50 more episodes with all the footage they shot. I know, it'd take forever to get something interesting out of that long trip, but... well, I'll live... and watch it again and again and again and again."
3,"great buddy flick, but....","I own a BMW and I was hoping for a lot more ""in the saddle"" commentary and motorcycle exploits than the film provided. It did have its share of MC related antics (calamities, mishaps, off-road adventure, etc) but this is, in the end, a buddy flick about Charley and Ewan wrapped around their trip around the world. Good fun, but all the gory details of the MC aspects were a little light."
4,Release date?,"I have to ask: is this the definitive version? The image says ""complete series"" and there are three discs. Is this the one that was available only in Canada and Europe for so long? I rated it 4 stars since I loved it when I watched it on Bravo, but I would like to know which box to buy."
4,A fascinating story,"For anyone who likes either motorcycles or travel to exotic locations, this video will provide hours of entertainment. While the editing is somewhat primitive, and the production a little low budget, it is on par with most ""reality"" TV shows. What makes the story so fascinating is the chance to see how life is lived in some of the more remote areas of the world. I was particularly taken by the lives of the people stranded in the more remote parts of Russia by the collapse of the USSR. Their tenacious attempts to live a normal life in the barrens of Siberia was amazing. Ewan McGregor seems less like Obiwan, and more like Frodo as he and Charley Boorman struggle to complete their quest. You may want to fast-forward through some parts, but the video is definitely worth watching."
4,10 Episode Zone 1 Version,Visit amazon.ca. Canada's zone 1 NTSC version is the extended 10-episode on 3-dvds. Don't have to buy the UK's PAL version.
4,an inspiration,"I first saw this on SkyOne when I was living in Europe and I was amazed at their journey. The camaraderie between the boys was great and the adventure that was documented was an inspiration for me to do a similar journey (although I only went around the USA).Seeing the trials and tribulations of two movie stars (ok, one star and another actor) was great because it put a personal touch to Ewan and Charley that I doubt many others would have seen if they didn't know them personally. Watching them work together with Russian truckers to make the Road of Bones passable made them both appear more human as they did the manual labor that few associate with Hollywood actors.Its a 7-part series that will engross you motorcyclists out there and leave you wanting to do a trip on your own. Make sure you block out plenty of time in one sitting to watch this - you may want to see the whole expedition in one go."
5,Great book/dvd even if you are not a rider.,"A really interesting story even if you are not a motorcycle rider. This book/dvd is what convinced me to buy a bike after many years of being harassed by my husband to learn to ride.So, for you guys out there that are still trying to convince your wife to ride, or just to let you own a bike...try this dvd. It's a bonus that Ewan Mcgregor is easy on the eyes. :)"
5,What a surprise,As a motorcycle guy I'm always interested in a good cycle movie. This movie was over the top. What these two accomplished was nothing short of amazing. The video crew was great as it followed the pair closely and even got a little screen time too. I was actually sad when the series ended and jumped right in to the next one-long way down.
5,A great show,"Even if you're not into motorcycles, Long Way Round is an entertaining journey that proves that the Law of Hospitality is truly universal across all cultures."
4,"Loved it, but wish I would have got the Special Edition 10-Episode Version","I got this as a gift for my dad for Christmas and we ended up watching the whole series in the following three days. It is such an epic journey to be summed up in just 7 episodes, but it was still worth it. I wish I would have looked around more to get the extended version (10-Episodes). It was really funny, intense, and inspiring. Even my wife who has no interest in motorcycles couldn't wait to watch the next episode. Amazon lists it's rating as PG but I was surprised at the number of F-bombs throughout the series. It might be something to consider if you are planning on getting it for, or watching it, with children. I hope to pick up the series of their second trip ""Long Way Down"" sometime soon."
5,"great movie, especially if you are an adventure biker","Ive ridden across east africa, alps, costa rica. Some of the situations that they get into are really what you deal with. Good to watch if you are thinking of riding in any 3rd world countries... May not be entertaining for a non rider or non adventurer..."
5,Awesome DVD,This is such a great adventure! Ewan McGregor is a great story teller and Charley is a crack up. This DVD is a must own for any motorcycle enthusiast. What these guys went through to make this journey was incredible!
3,long film to watch,"I have mixed feelings on this one, I enjoyed Ewen and Charley immensely, they are very likeable souls. the filming was a little chopped up for my tastes, even though it broken up into many segments I felt they edited out too much , after all it is a trip around the world. Filming it might have proved too daunting, I have ordered the book though hoping that it might fill in the missing gaps. I commend them on their herculean efforts though. A mighty task indeed! the dvd is broken into episodes as they were actually airing on television at some point. I would give it a B."
2,Not as described,"I bought this DVD for my father for Christmas as he is a motorcycle enthusiast and I knew he'd love it. However, it is NOT closed caption as is described in the product specs. Amazon's response to my inquiry regarding this was to send me another NON-CC DVD. I'm sure the story is fabulous, but wanted to warn those that are interested and may need it in CC."
3,Nothing really new here,"Not a bad work on the topic,but don't expect any revelations - it's pretty basic. I don't find myself referring to it much."
1,Poor quality,Absolute poor quality. Hose is very cheap and develops a very strong memory being wound on its spool. Constantly having to work out the twists. Pulling out the hose is remarkably difficult and it only winds when you push the hose back on. You constantly have to help lay the hose as it winds or it bunches up in the same spot and then stops spinning altogether. Even the air connections are poor quality and had to replace those as well. Currently shopping for a superior reel.
1,Get a better reel than this,"Agree with other reviewers this one is a don't buy, particularly if you live where it gets cold, the pvc pipe gets a terrible memory. Mine started to get small leaks after 2 years & burst in cold weather after 3. I just bought 25ft of rubber hose & replaced the PVC. See how that goes. For $69 you can get a really good rubber hose reel from Tractor Supplies (I have one of those now too.)"
5,air hose reel,I bought one of these models and i have had it for 2 years and it has worked perfectly. It finally tore up where the air hose goes into the reel at the end of the hose. Could not find a way to fix it unless i took off the whole side of it. I would give this model 5 stars. It is a excellent reel. I went to Tractor Supply and bought the legacy air hose reel with 75 feet of hose. Have yet got it mounted because of health problem. Legacy puts out excellent equipment. I would defintly recommend this model to a friend. It is priced right and works excellent.
4,Nifty little camera.,"It's such a cute little/big camera, I want to say little but it's actually bigger than I thought it'd be. It's just so much fun taking pics with and I've found getting 120 film developed isn't as expensive as I once thought it'd be, it's actually cheaper to get done than 35mm depending on where you take it. For example WalMart's drop off service box can get ti done fair cheaply, while at the same time 35mm seems to cost quite a bit there. Either way this camera is loads fun and I can't wait for spring and summer to get to use it even more."
5,The joy of the Junker,This little gem is an adventure to operate! The only camera in the world where it's flaws are it's greatest attributes. Breakout from the boring rectangullar world of digital photography! this little beauty shows you a whole new world of photography!
5,Best Buy,"This buy was one of the smartest decisions I've made. It's a great camera for stepping outside of the ordinary and expected. Every shot is an experiment in light, focus and personal style. I love my Holga and would greatly suggest one to a curious photographer, amateur or professional."
3,fun little camera,"If you approach this camera with the right attitude, you won't be disappointed. Its fun going back to a simple, non-digital camera and not knowing how each shot will turn out, if at all. I took this camera to Coachella (oh the irony) and it ended up producing a bunch of great shots. If you're willing to lay down the bucks to get the film processed. I brought it to my local camera shop and got a little gauged. I can see myself using it for special occasions."
4,Still experimenting,"Yes, it's suppose to be a crappy camera and take crappy pictures; and it does. First thing I did was to tape it together! I got it in order to make me take my time and look at things in a different way. Still working on that one. Enjoying the process."
4,Good,"As far as basic cameras go, this is about as basic as you can get besides pin-hole cameras. It is cheap plastic but is light weight and gets the job done. Great for film beginners."
2,very cool but.....,"so i got this camera to toss in my bag and use for fun. i've been shooting for several years now and am well aware of basic concepts of photography (e.g. aperture, shutter-speed, film speed, as well as film and print development etc). my first roll was completely washed out. i was pretty upset, i had a lot of great pictures on that roll and they were gone, huge bummer. i haven't used it since. the thing that blew me away was that two of the pictures developed, the rest were completely blank. while i assume it was something i did i couldn't pin-point what it was and still have no clue. i'm going to stick with my trusty 35mm, hope you have better luck than i did."
4,Fun little gem,"I've been a Holga user for the past decade, and the 120N is definitely an upgrade (if you could call it that) from the older Holga 120S. Light leaks are part of the Holga's charm, but sometimes you want a nice, clean image. Unlike the previous generations of Holgas, I've never had to wrap the 120N in black tape.One caveat: always check your settings. Many times I've inadvertently slid it over to ""bulb,"" producing a very blurry picture. Unless you're in a very low light situation and you have a tripod handy, don't touch the bulb setting."
2,"Hard to call this a ""Best Of""","The tracks on this album are from just two Mediaeval Baebes albums: ""Salva Nos"" and ""Worldes Blysse"". As of 1999, these were the only two albums they had released, and the only two they released on Virgin. But it's hard to justify a ""Best Of"" album based on two releases. The album has 20 of the 32 tracks issued on the two albums. No wonder the album isn't mentioned on the Mediaeval Baebes web site. However, it would still be an okay deal if the album really did have the best cuts from their first two albums, but it's missing ""An Adult Lullaby"", ""Verbum Caro"", and ""This Ay Nicht"" from ""Salva Nos"" and ""All Turns To Yesterday"" from ""Worldes Blysse"". So I can't say that this is really the best of even these two albums. Save your money and get ""Worldes Blysse""; if you like it and want to get more classical, then get ""Salva Nos"" or move forward to ""The Rose"" or ""Mirabilis"""
4,SummerSlam '89 by an old fan,"This is definately one of the stronger SummerSlams. Just look at the lineup:Main EventWWF Champion Hulk Hogan and Brutus ""The Barber"" BeefcakeVS.""Macho Man"" Randy Savage and ""The Human Wrecking Machine"" Zeus (that guy from ""No Holds Barred"")Intercontinental Title MatchIntercontinental Champion Ravishing Rick Rude (RIP) VS. The Ultimate WarriorSix Man Tag MatchesHacksaw Jim Duggan (King Of The Ring at the time) and Demolition (Ax and Smash) VS. Andre The Giant (RIP) and The Twin Towers (Big Boss Man and Akeem)Tito Santana and The Rockers (Marty Jannetty and a young Shawn Michaels) VS. Rick Martel and The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond)These are just some highlights. This is back when the WWF had much better charecters who had a lot of charisma. It's at least a chance to see some of today's ""old guys"" when they were young and in their prime. When SummerSlam was still new."
4,HENRY S AKA EXODUST,CLASSICAL SUMMERSLAM BUT I WISH THE MAIN EVENT WOULDVE BEEN HULK HOGAN AGAINST ZEUS. BUT IT WAS HARD HOW VINCE MADE THE STORY FROM THE MOVIES 2 THE JEALOUS OF ZEUS NOT WINNING AT THE BLOCKBUCTER NO HOLDS BARRED. ALL MATCHES WAS GOOD IN MY BOOK SUMMERSLAMS R BETTER THAN WRESTLEMANIAS.
1,Not 8X Compliant,These disks are NOT 8X compliant with the LITE-ON 8X DVD Dual Layer drive. Chances are they aren't compliant with any DVD recorder - they will only record at 4x speed. The label on the inner circle of the DVD clearly indicates 8X in the DVD write speed.
4,Andy Mac Skateboard,"I'm new to skateboarding, but overall I would say the Andy Mac Skateboard is pretty nice. It looked just like the picture when it arrived and the graphics on the bottom of the board look great. However, the first time I took it out, one of the wheels came off right away. I think it's a pretty good skateboard for the money, and for someone just starting out like me."
2,doest moisturize for long,i used it on my daughter and it smells good and it help to comb it but then it dry out during the day and the hair become hard again.
2,Not up to her previous mysteries,"Hartzmark's characters and settings are always interesting. This latest Kate Milholland mystery, however, has too much blood and gore as well as too much detail about pharmaceutical chemistry -- and not enough mystery."
2,Disappointing,I found the overall tone of the book was Anger and I found myself becoming more and more angry and short tempered with my autistic child after having read the book. Admittedly I was unable to finish the book due to these findings. I did not find the book helpful and was very disappointed.
4,Great CD,"Ronnie Bowman has a stellar cast here--Tony Rice, Sammy Shelor, Tim Austin, and one track with all of the Del McCoury Band. This CD is one of his best, with a blend of pure bluegrass and emotional newgrass. It's a solid buy."
4,Wrong album art displayed,"Yo Amazon--You have the wrong CD on the page for this item. It's Sidney Torch music, and you have an Ibert album illustrating it."
3,"OK, but mostly past interview material","Chronologically, this was a good history of his career. But reading the book, I couldn't help feeling that I had heard much of this before. All direct quotes from Billy Joel were taken from newspaper and magazine interviews as he did not participate in this book.I have heard that this was a negetive portrayal of Mr. Joel, but I found it to be realistic. Nobody is perfect."
4,Until the Real Thing Comes Along...This'll Have to Do,"This biography of Billy Joel is the best one I've ever seen of Billy. It's also the only one I've ever seen. Bordowitz has put together a decent, though not definitive, look at Billy Joel's career by splicing together interviews with ex-associates of BJ's, articles from other magazines, and a few of BJ's TV interviews. To say that the sources are thin would be an understatement. Bordowitz also makes a few glaring chronological errors that should've been edited out. He refers to 1981 as the end of the Reagan Years in the White House, when really it was just the beginning. He also refers to Axl Rose as an early 1980's contemporary of Billy's.For all of this book's faults it's still interesting. It is a quick read and will tide over fans of Billy Joel until the autobiography comes out. That'll probably happen when Billy is ready to get married a 4th time. Maybe in three years."
2,Not much new,"As a life long Billy Joel fan, I was very excited to read this book. However, I found little if no new information on Billy Joel. In fact, the book seemed to be a compilation of material that was already out there. The author interviewed nobody in the true inner circle of Billy Joel. No bad memmbers, no ex wives etc."
3,Good early history of a great entertainer,"I was glad to see a book about Billy Joel. It was about time! Content would be a 3.5 stars to me. While Hank admits it was difficult to get people to spill the beans on Billy's more recent life information, the information provided on the early days was quite good. Information on his beginnings and Levittown were very interesting. As the previous reviewer stated, some of my favorite events and people appeared as an afterthought. Crystal and Mark were hardly mentioned. Crystal sings Billy's high notes now - certainly she should be more to the story. Yankee Stadium was a huge event. The DVD had more insight to it than the book. The book also failed to illustrate Billy's stage presence and performing antics that make his shows worth every penny we pay to see them. I think Hank was more interested in dirt than the whole story and when he could not get the dirt, he passed on the story. The book is still a worthwhile read if you are a fan. Could have been better."
3,spanish telenovelas,I would like to say this is a very good telenovela with Mario Cimarro as always playing an excellent part.Greetings to all fansRITABELGIUM
5,LRC,"I am not an educated musician, but I like these mallets. They are priced affordably and they make a crisp, clear sound when I strike the bells."
5,Highly Recommended,"My cat is obsessed with this laser light. The second I pick it up, she's ready for it. She'll even wake up from a nap if she hears the sound of the keychain! LED light is very bright and helpful as well. Love this product."
3,you get what you pay for,"My dog loves the laser light, but the button for the flashlight fell off on the second day."
1,looks cool but worked for 5 min,This item worked for 5 min and stoped working changed the batteries helped but stoped working after 5min. not worth the price. its a rip
5,Great Cat Toy,This is the greates laser toy for my cats. They love and I enjoy watching them chasing it.
4,"Good, but a little dim","It's a little bit too dim to use in a bright room during the day, but works well with the shades closed or at night. My cats love chasing this (and any other) laser pointer."
3,Its a laser....,It was cheap enough and my cats love chasing the light. I wished it lasted a little bit longer. It is cheaper to buy a new laser then replace the batteries.
3,Not Bad,"I'll just Pro and Con this:Pros:My cat loves this thing.The laser is bright.Not a bad feel when holding it.Cons:Cheap buttons.The key chain makes it kinda wonky.The flash light doesn't work to well.Ya, thats about it. Just like all Cheap lasers there is a lot of cheap things about the laser."
2,"Flashlight, NOT a laser pointer","My cats LOVE chasing the magical red-dot of a laser pointer around, and it's a nice way to tire out kittens before bed. Due to 'laser' in the name, I expected a laser pointer that would create a small dot when pointed across a room. This has a cone-shaped throw, so instead of a laser beam of light, this has a red circle a foot across on the other side of the room. My cats are completely disinterested. I now leave it in my wife's car for use as a flashlight which is why I'm giving it a 2nd star, as it does seem to work for that."
1,Not worth your money!!,"This laser only worked for about an hour, tops! I have tried moving the batteries changing them, and tighting the screw on cap different ways. I am extremely disappointed in this product!! for the hour that it did work my cat loved it."
2,It wasn't what I ordered,It has only the red laser but no blue beam. The reason this thing is named 2 in 1 was because of an additional Heart Shape Hanger Light (it blinks in shades when it detects vibration) for your pets.
1,really bummed,I was so excited to get this because my dogs love lasers. however when I got the product it was missing one of the 3 batteries that are needed to power the laser. the tip of the package was cut open and someone had slipped out the battery. I know I can go buy more batteries that is not the issue the issue is I bought this product and it was missing a piece to make it work. not happy this product was shipped to me missing pieces
2,Fell apart immediately,The batteries keep falling out because the top that screws on keeps falling off. Inexpensive item and you get what you pay for! Better to spend a little more to get a product that works consistently.
1,POS Don't buy it,The batteries died after about 5 minutes of playing with it. I bought new batteries for it and they died after 5 minutes too.
1,Good for a laugh,"Um, this poetry is really really spectacularly bad. Sorry if you like this kind of thing--I guess some people do. But I honestly have to say that it is terrible. Almost entirely (poorly) rhymed trite catch-phrases, like ""It is really up to me/to be whatever I want to be."" Just a bunch of syrup, content free. My friends and I only read them to each other to make each other laugh because the poems are so bad. Sorry."
1,Good for a laugh,"Um, this poetry is really, really, spectacularly bad. I hope I don't hurt anyone's feelings by this, but basically it is just a bunch of (poorly) rhymed trite catch-phrases, like ""It really is up to me/to be whatever I want to be."" No content other than feel-good syrup. I guess some people must actually like this kind of thing, but honestly, I think it is terrible. My friends read them to each other to get a laugh, but that's it."
4,What a heart warming book. Such a breath of fresh air.,I have read books that left an impression but this one was worth sharing with others. The comments made were as if they were meant for me and me alone. It was as if the message of love was directed to me and my situations. I felt so much better after reading. Thanks for getting this book to me so quickly and to have it signed to me was an added bonus.
1,this is not a toy,"i can't understand why this was classified as a toy, because the figures were less than a 1/4 inch tall"
4,Nice Supplement to Valuation,"I hate buying textbooks for class, but this is the one textbook that i'm going to keep after class. It is more like a handbook as it contains an incredible amount of useful information on valuation. WACC, ROIC, EP, DCF it is all here the list could go on and on and ..... The workbook gets you tuned into the finer points that can get lost in the regular text. Reading the workbook questions makes you say ""oh, that's what they were talking about."" This book is extremely helpful if your teacher gives you a 100 true/false question test as my teacher did. Overall a great supplement to the valuation book. However, the book seems to contain some errors such as the broken out ROIC formula. In the main text it is listed differently than what is in the workbook. Not so helpful when trying to study for a test."
3,not very much useful,"The problems designed in this book are all basic questions and are not very practical, but it is good for understanding basic definitions of the textbook."
4,Fit needs work,"The buttstock is a little loose no matter how hard I try to tighten it. The buttstock also protrudes where it meets with the metal of the shotgun. If you have a side saddle shell holder, you will have to do a little modification, but it still functions and looks great."
4,nice big pliers,i have been turning wrenches for a long time and some tools you can't go cheap on. These pliers are pretty darn close to being as nice as channelock brand but a fair amount cheaper.
3,"not much tension, fluffy book",donna fletcher is an ok author but the novels don't have that spark that draw you back to re-read or gasp with emotions. temporary entertainment.
5,Charlie Waller at his best.......,This collection shows some variations of Charlie's baritone that are not often seen. Of particular note are Mountains and Memories and One More Hill. All the songs on this CD are excellent....mellow and melodious.
3,Nice reinforcement or change from others,"My toddler is just not as interested in this series as in some others like leap frog, preschool prep or signing times. But it's a nice variation for times where you feel like you've seen the others thousands of times."
1,Disappointed,Not recommended for those expecting a scientific approach. The absence of any description of the author's academic background explains it all.
3,Off His Game,"This Spenser novel was hard to finish, something rare in the world of Robert B. Parker. Spenser was okay, although I never got a clear feeling as to why he would care about a bad-tempered, humorless, vicious (...) like Rachel Wallace. Like most humorless people, she took herself and her ideas way too serious. And like most feminists I have known (and I am a female), she hates being stereotyped yet attacks Spenser over and over again with her own sterotypes about masculine men. Just another loud-mouthed hypocrit. Parker did have her character down cold, but just didn't create a believable interaction between her and Spenser. Maybe next time."
4,Parker,"As previously stated, I have gone back to the original Spenser novels, and started reading them. They are perfect escape novels, but as old as they are, would hope Amazon would offer a price reduction. Thanks."
3,Classic spenser,"Although the book was dated, I think I enjoyed that part the most. Typical Spenser - worth the read if you like Spenser. If you are looking for Classic Literature this is not it. Just fun and quick."
4,Spenser and Rachel Wallace,"A not completely typical Spenser novel. Looking for Rachel Wallace will probably be remembered for its picture perfect portrayal of a particular kind of feminist who has grown rare in the world. If you want to indulge yourself in typical Spenser banter, this novel does not descend to completely into the expected. Still, it should please Spenser fans."
4,3.5 Stars,"Fantastic book. The homosexual character of Rachael Wallace is terse and difficult to feel sympathetic towards but I've known people like her. They exist. Parker's writing seems to morph a bit (becomes more cut and dry) approximately midway. Regardless, Parker's incredibly acerbic, dry and witty style is fulfilling. He is always surprisingly literate, analytical and loving... and Spenser is always there when you need him. The Spenser series has been a great discovery. I give Parker 5 BIG stars."
2,such a boring book!,"I don't understand why Robert Parker spent 200 pages for this book, you can guess who kidnapped Rachel right from the middle of the book at least! Plot is horrible, book consists of nothing but sexist dialogues between Spenser and Rachel. This book is one of the most terrible in Spenser series"
5,SPENSER'S SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Robert B. Parker's sixth Spenser book, LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE, is a good one. I am working my way through the Spenser series and it just keeps getting better. Private eye, Spenser (remember SPENSER FOR HIRE on TV, that guy)is a good detective and so funny, such a smart ass. I love it. Spenser is hired to be a bodyguard to Rachael Wallace, author, gay advocate and openly gay. They clash over and over and he is finally fired. Then Rachael disappears and Spenser goes on the hunt. He is one of the gendre's great characters. HIGH RECOMMENDED. On to the next book."
3,Looking for Rachel Wallace,"This was boring, I wouldn't have gotten that interested in Parker books if this was the first one I had read. Disappointed"
1,Disappointed,1) Definitely not one of Parker's better books. Much too descriptive...I would delicately describe it as a 50/50.My experience with this book would be to say that there were only two brief parts of the book that held my attention.
4,Good cleaner,This comes in a box of nine with a hefty shipping charge.It works well but check on the price by comparing it to a one bottle purchase from a store.
5,Excellent product for price.,"Bought this for my daughter because she loves playing ""rock star"". I ended up buying a small amplifier at Toys R Us for $25. Works great!"
1,stopped working after 4 days,"Will need to return this item, however, we already threw the box away, not sure if we still can. This was a Christmas present for my daughter and she used it for only 4 days and it started crackling and intermittently stopped working altogether. Now, after 6 days it is no longer working at all. Very sad because it feels solid and well built with the exception of the plug between the cable and the microphone, that is made out of plastic and is very loose. I have the feeling that might be the issue and I am not sure if that can be replaced somehow."
3,Nady Center Stage Microphone,"The product is great quality and the kids love it. The only caveat for non-tech savvy folks like me is that the product information said ""you just plug it in and it's ready to go"". What I failed to understand was that I needed to plug it into an amp, which we did not have. We are lucky that our neighbors play in a band, so they had an old amp we could have. Also, we still have not figured out how to get the mic stand/tri-pod legs to stay in one position."
4,Microphone & Amplifier,"Santa brought this microphone for my 8-year old Christmas 2008. He loves to play with it. The cord is really long, which is good. I bought also from Amazon a Starcaster 15G amplifier which is perfect for this microphone. We have some good home performances now!"
5,awesome,My 9 year old daughter received this from Santa. She loves to play rock star. This microphone was perfect. It adjust to the perfect height and the sound is great. She loves it and we are all happy! Great item!
2,Mic stand. Works but had broken parts!!!,I bought this mic/stand combo for my daughter for Christmas! We decided to take it out of the box and set it next to the tree. One of the cord clips was completely shattered. AND the mesh metal part you speak into was cracked and will not stay on the microphone! The sound is pretty good though. I would probably do some better searching before buying this one!!!
3,Hasbro Amp does not fit!,"The Nady mic is great but do not buy it with the Hasbro amp as Amazon suggests, because the mic does NOT fit in the amp! We had a near disaster Christmas morning - luckily my husband is a musician and was able to let my daughter use one of his professional amps. Otherwise- the mic works great;"
1,Quality problem,The mesh part of the microphone fell off the first week. It seems to have unscrewed. I tried to screw it back in...but this part broke off as it is very thin. So I have to crazy glue the parts back together.This should be made in much thicker plastic
1,It fell apart in 10 days,"You know what they always say, ""you get what you paid for"". Bought the mic because of the great deal and other good reviews about it. But after 10 days, the cable came loose, and then just fell apart from the base of the mic. I tried to repair it and opened it up to find a rusty iron piece of metal which added the superficial weight of 'quality' and realized the pins on the cable just simply fell off."
1,Would be nice if it worked,"I bought 2 of these for each child and I also have 2 different types of AMPS to plug them in to. However, the microphone works probably 10% of the time. A huge disappointment!"
2,Stand OK microphone not good,"I bought this for my teenager son who plays guitar. We also bought a mixer from RadioShack to feed the microphone and guitar outputs to an amplifier.We were not happy with the quality of the microphone. The voice is muffled and not clear at all. We bought a microphone from RadioShack for $35 and that was great. We thought of returning the whole thing to Amazon but since we liked the stand (it is small and compact .. not too heavy unlike the ones we saw at RadioShack) we kept it. We don't use the microphone at all.If you are buying it for the included microphone, my advice would be to stay away from it."
3,Doesn't fit my Hasbro amp :-(,"I was really bummed on Xmas morning when I opened this mic and found that I can't use it with my Hasbro Power Tour amp as suggested. The plug is incompatible, it's too big.Bummer!"
1,Broken right out of the box,"The microphone is made from plastic which was broken right out of the box, which was disappointing since it seemed a good value."
1,Nice stand....but the mic...,"Ordered and recieved two. Both had a good stand but the microphone was broken. Agree with previous review, stand is worth about 20 dollars."
3,"Perfect for pretend, would not recommend for serious use","I bought this for my 10 year old daughter who loves to sing and dance. The stand is what I was looking for mostly and that is a good thing, considering the piece attaching the microphone to the cord was cracked in 3 places. I taped it back together, and since we have no plans to utilize the cord with an amplifier I guess for the money paid, it will serve the purpose for pretend play."
1,Don't purchase!!!!,"I purchased this for my daughter as a replacement gift for the the kiddy pink light up microphone. Thant microphone only lasted 3 weeks. I received a refund for that one. I thought that if i purchased areal microphone, it would work. No, I ordered this one & the little amp that amazon suggested.The mini amp worked fine, but no sound was coming out of the mic. I ended up going to Guitar Center & the microphone was bad. I decided to purchase a new microphone & throw the old one out. I really wanted to keep the stand, you can't find that anywhere. So, I should have just went to Guitar Center first. Hope this helps anyone that is looking."
5,For Rock Band 2,"First, you need an adapter to use this mic with Rockband (try a company called Blockhead). With that said this mic and stand is great. It is very adjustable and is neither too light nor too heavy. The mic has an excellent response and is built much better than the ones I purchased from Bloackhead. I saw a comment from someone about the quality of the audio from it, but I have not had any issues after consulting the manual that comes with it. By keeping a bit of space between you and the mic you will find the sweet spot. Just don't try to eat the mic when you use it. Great product overall. I am very happy and I am recommending this to all by buddies who play Rockband and already have an adapter."
5,Nice microphone for the price,"Bought this for my 12 year old daughter to practice singing and it's a nice microphone for the price. Not a ""professional"" sound quality but it works, amplifies nicely, and is a trerrific price for a starter microphone. The stand is great and she is easily able to adjust the height to her liking."
4,"Works good, great value","These mics are inexpensive, that is why I bought them. A great buy for the buck. We have an event every week called ""open mic night"" and I didn't want to buy anything too nice because I knew they would get ruined. The only down falls are (which could be fixed by spending a little more)the cord clips that attach the cord to the mic stand fall off all the time, you are better off not using them and I wish they gave you something to put the mics in to protect them. Again I could have spent more to get more. Happy so far."
5,Perfect for kids that love to perform!,"I bought this microphone for my 6yr old daughter for her birthday. Wow, was she ever happy to receive it. We had to buy an amplifyer to hook up the mic. Once everything was hooked up and working, she said that she felt like a rock star. She is in the basement singing ALL the time! We have not had any problems with the stand or the mic itself. The product is well made."
4,Bought as a microphone for a child,"My daughter wanted a ""real"" microphone for her birthday. We got her this and it has been a hit since day one! Unless there is a way to extend the stand that I haven't found, it is the perfect height for kids! To go along with the mic we did buy the Starcaster 15G Guitar Amplifier to go with it. I am not a pro on musical equipment but both items are meeting ourStarcaster 15G Guitar Amplifierexpectations."
3,Broke in 2 minutes,Not very durable.This was my daughter's request from Santa. As we were setting it up on Christmas eve I dropped the microphone and the mesh top popped off and a plastic piece inside snapped. I was able to pop it back on and it works but my daughter spotted it right away.Now my daughter thinks that Santa's quality control is not very good.
2,Good Price for the stand...mic is junk!!,"This seems like a good package and the stand in nice. However, the microphone was broken and arrived as if never assembled OR sat in a warehouse for so many years that it has worn down to junk. I would not recommend this unless the price drops below $20...and in that case, you'd have a good stand ONLY"
1,Mic Stand,The worse stand I ever bought. The leg broke off less than 24 hours after my son opened it on his B-Day.
1,Arrived Broken,"My mother purchased this for christmas for my daughter and when she opened up the box and took it out, unwrapped it and the pop of the microphone fell off1"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This product is crap! It didn't work the day I received it. Before going through the hassle and cost of shipping it back and waiting for a new one, I went to my local music store to make sure it was a problem with the microphone. The music store informed me that the microphone wire wasn't working at all. Ended up buying a wire from the music store. Worked for two weeks, then two weeks and one day later, the microphone stopped working again. I am told by Amazon that my return time has expired. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!"
1,Would not purchase from Company,"I ordered this item well in advance to receive it for my child for Christmas. When I placed the order I did not realize that I was ordering from an actual company, Price Pros, as opposed to Amazon. The item never arrived and I did not get an email that the item was out of stock until after Christmas. I will never order from this company again."
1,piece of junk,I got this for my 4 year old for Christmas.. My first complaint was I did not realize until after I received the item that I also need to purchase an amp for it to work. From the day he opened it at Christmas I have had problems getting it to work. It seemed to have a short in the connection between the cable and the microphone. If you pushed on the cord and held it a certain way it would work. Now 3 months later it does not work at all and it is too late to return for a refund. Not to mention I have an amp that has no use by itself. So much for a fun Christmas present.
2,STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE,"While the movie is visually proficient, there's little else to recommend this dubbed Russian spooker.It's one of the worst dubbed films since GODZILLA. The lead actor is awful and the rest are even worse!The threadbare incohesive plot revolves around a journalist who poses as a murdered priest on his way to some small town to rid them of some witch's curse. It's obviously supposed to be set in America but there is NOTHING American about this movie. You might rent it for a laugh."
5,one of the best role playing game ever !,"i have a ds and i wish this was on it but to bad! i got it as a suprise for my gamecube and its a blast. you get to be any bratz girl. you can even text message to other bratz! its so fun because in there is cloe, yasmine, sasha, and jade! those are the girls you can be but here are the others. roxxie, maygen, phobe, cameron, dylan, coby and a new girl! its amazing because you can go to 15 diffrent stores for fashion! you can talk to others and to diffrent tasks! you can collect special money to go to the movies or get your hair done or get makeup! you get an office so you can finish your magazine and the fashions are so cool. there is hats glasses and you can take photos and so much more! its a role play but you also have to do some jobs too. its a great bratz game that will be hot in christmas."
3,"i don't know, may be it is too much for my 5 year old daughter","i bought this game for my 5 year old daughter who is a big fan of the bratz, but she seem havn't enjoyed it much, i think it is not suitable for herbut the price is very good and the delivary was fast, and the conition was too good to be of a used one"
3,These movies seem dated now....,"If you've seen these films recently, you know what I mean that they are dated. The real reaseon I decided to write a review, though is this. The description claims that these are the wide screen versions of the films, but they say on the beginning that they are modified from their original versions though they are presented with black bars at the top and bottom on standard screens. I think they are full screen versions cut down to appear as wide screen. Besides that, they do not contain the trailers or character bios as stated on the outside packaging. It is simply the films contained on one side of the disc."
2,Sent Wrong Edition,Book arrived in good time and in good shape but was wrong edition. I am disappointed and hoping that this older version will suit my purposes.
1,Cannot be used by serious researcher!,"Cannot be used as a source because of an incorrect translation, which distorts the histrography. Also there are other issues concerning the scholarship. It might could be saved if the editor and publishers were to redo the work. Perhaps grade school teachers could use the book in support of their lesson plans. Invest in both a better translated and written book."
4,Still an essential reference for Maritime birders,"A very good provincial work with status accounts for each of the province's species, enlivened by notes and anecdotes collected by the late Dr. Robie Tufts during his 90+ years of observing birds in N. S. Updated by Dr. Ian McLaren, one of the current deans of N. S. birders, and others. The colour illustrations by Roger Peterson and John Crosby, and line drawings by John Dick are still delightful."
2,"Good, but not as good as the 1st season.","I will have to agree with some of you. As this show started (1st season) I was addicted. It was my favorite show, and I'd never miss an episode. I loved the old characters, and how it was more 'dramatic'. This 2nd season is alright, but definitely nothing like the first. As said before, majority of the characters who made the show worth it, are gone. The new ones aren't as interesting. The show has gotten rather boring, but nonetheless, I was sad to see it go. I was hoping they'd spice it up some more, and bring it back!"
5,Master of Puppetry,"These movies were the best fantasy's of the 80's. To put these 2 movies together, especially on DVD with the great sound and picture plus extra features! It is a dream come true! So if you remember these movies when they came out, Relive that time in your life and buy this pack. You won't get a better price anywhere else!"
5,great costume!,"It fits really well, came quickly in the mail, and am looking forward to wearing it for halloween!"
3,Heartfelt Story,"Bella is a heartfelt story in which the lives of a waitress (Tammy Blanchard), and a cook (Eduardo Versategui) are meshed together. The cook has a dark past he isn't to grips with just yet. They are both struggling to make sense of the world, and as they are brought together, they find solace in one another.I came upon this film when searching Netflix for something to watch. It was available on Instant Play, so it was watched. Eduardo Versategui, whom I've never heard of before, was wonderfully affected in this role. His cool calm character has a haunting past that you can see in his eyes at all times. White Tammy Blanchard was a bit too brash for my tastes, it isn't a love story, so it does help with the plotline. This is a touching and sweet story that had me crying, at least once."
5,Sensitive movie with a message,Both my wife and Ienjoyed this movie and will watch it again and again for it's well produced and written story.
4,"A Wonderful TRUE LOVE Story, but not as expected, Better..","What a great ""down to earth"" true to life beautiful, thought provoking movie.Movies such as this are not really ""Movies"", but an unexpected admission (by all involved) to view a slice of what appears to be ""real"" peoples lives.This has transcended the identifiable art form known as a ""movie"".It is more of a view from a remote location (perhaps your home) across time and geography,into peoples lives that show us and touch us with others life experiences that we can all be enriched and grow from.I am surprised and driven to think and feel the unexpected from the experience of watching this slice of life.I highly recommend it."
4,Very Good,"I was very impressed by this movie. No inappropriate material; sex, language, etc. A movie about the importance of choices made, family, forgiveness, and understanding."
5,A movie celebrating life and sacrifice!,"Bella depicts true sacrifice in the face of decision. A soccer star grieved with his past attempts to save the life of another in a most compelling and surprising way. Courageous, sacrificial, compassionate! Unheard of in today's society!"
4,more buddhist than catholic,"I heard this movie pontifcated catholic theology - when in reality the plot definately swayed in the direction of Karma. Not only catholic, but pro-life which is part of the catholic dogma. In more than simply the 'major decision' that is the duh-factor of this movie's plot I found the respect for life and a person's place, where they are, without judgement to be even more powerful. The main character is something of a mystery by western society's social standards. It's refreshing."
4,Unusual move,This portrayed a very controversial subject in a personal and effective way. I'd recommend this to anyone touched by an unplanned pregnancy.
3,Not a soccer movie,"This is a good movie, but has nothing to do with soccr. As a Spanish teacher, I was looking for a movie about a soccer player. This movie, even in teacher resource magazines, leads one to believe that there will something about soccer in it. There is only a brief mention of a career that was cut short."
2,Need more information,I heard such great things about this movie. It's not really for kids - the topics are too deep and the scene where the child is hit by the car was too much for my kids. Mostly the movie didn't fill enough information. Through the whole movie we were waiting for the pieces to fall together and they never really did. Is there another version of the movie - like an uncut version?
1,Too Little Too Long,"So boring. So empty. The tedious food scenes. The kindergarten dialogue. The drawn out visuals. The pretending that there is a ""new"" perspective on the eternal dilemma between abortion and adoption and life; there is nothing new, only the same painful anguish of the predicament. What most upset me was the ridiculousness of attributing such high guilt and shame to the most innocent accident. There is no fault, no responsibility; only an accidental tragedy and yet we are supposed to believe that the driver had to go to prison for four years? Please! All together a complete waste of time."
2,"It stand out Latin values, besides that it sucks","If you analize the script of this movie, it's about NOTHING, was Verastegui's character a Pshychic, to know that the girl was going to try to abort the baby, and that it would be a baby girl??? Some of the scenes are really out of context"
1,Bella,"I thought this movie was awful. I decided to purchase it without seeing it because the reviews were so wonderful. What a waste of money.... the movie was really slow, there was really no plot and it could have been summed up a lot quicker. I have watched alot of movies in my time and this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Bella,"Excellent story, well told; no sexual overtones. Delightful, calm but exciting movie. Excellent acting; tender real-life situation. Could not be more pleased."
5,Wow! I didn't think it was special until the end which caught me by surprise.,"A truly rare great movie with the story, acting, and directing.PROS:- life moments- unique love story- there are a lot of clues that I never picked up until they're revealedCONS:- have patience because it will be worthwhile."
2,*Yawn*,"I kept waiting for this movie to get to the point. It meanders its way through flashbacks and flash-forwards and, in the end, I just didn't care!"
3,Bella,This movie had a great idea but putting into film was obviously too hard. The story leaves something to be desired! It is pieced together and leaves you to finish the story for yourself.
1,Snooze,"What a boring movie. The beautiful actor has a hideous grungy, mangy, thick beard so you can't even enjoy looking at his face. Slow and boring. The best part that made me the happiest was when it ended."
2,"Sorry, but this movie was disappointing!","The movie was filled with too many dull scenes; restaurant kitchen, riding subways, walking on sidewalks, etc. Even the ending, which was sweet in a way, was dragged out by watching Ms. Blanchard gazing out a taxi window. I was disappointed in this movie. Not a ""keeper""."
2,What's the Big Deal?,"This is too plain of a movie, and I was disappointed that I purchased it. It is not a bad movie, but I do not see the big hype about it being the best reviewed movie. It is boring."
5,big cinema low budget,"This is not a classical love story but a story of love, a lesson of true love, a lesson of hope. Love of life, love of true feeling. Without moralizing, with a language simple and essential. Very good acting, very good direction, very good immages and editing, speedy and rhythmic. It's a rare production low budget where the level of quality is so high. Highly recommended."
5,Film at its finest,"What a serendipitous discovery at the local video store!I loved everything about this movie. The acting was superb and the story was moving. It is very rare that a movie inspires me to be a better person--mother, wife, friend. This one did just that.This is most definitely film at its finest. Bravo to those who wrote, produced, directed and acted in this film!"
3,Small and Disappearing,"This French dictionary is just the size and shape I wanted, but it has two problems. One I should have expected, but the other came as a disturbing surprise. The first, expected problem is that the print is quite small, and someone with less-than-perfect eyesight or anyone in dim lighting will have trouble making out the words. The unexpected problem is that pages 291 to 354 are missing in the copy I received! That meant that I was without translations for all the English words between ""indigo"" and ""resuscitate"" in trying to make myself understood to French speakers in Quebec.I probably should have demanded a refund, as the flawed dictionary is nearly useless. However, given the $4.95 price of the book, it was easy to consider it a throw-away."
5,Perfect size,I would definitely recommend this dictionary as it was the perfect size to carry around while trekking all over France and yet there were very few words we tried to look up that weren't in it. The conjugation and french numbers information in the front were a handy bonus.
2,Print too small,"The font in this dictionary is much too small for me. I wear 150 reading glasses but never have problems reading with them on. My daughter with perfect eyesight had trouble reading the print. One might need a magnifying glass, as I do, to read this pocket size book. Pocket size and comprehensive it is, but again, the print is much too small for me and many."
5,Old Maine state police,"This is a great telling of old state law enforcement,both sad and funny.I know some of Eddie Marks relitives and they are as Quirky and dry humored as he. Karen Lemke's newer book""Return of the downeast detective"" is more serious as is life now."
1,i know what you did for a payday!,"these two movies are bottom of the barrel ""slice and dice"" movies and don't stand the true test of a good horror movie,do i want to see it again?(not on your life)! to be kind the first""summer"" does show some sparks at first but soon settles into grab bag of every horror shock trick in the book. the actors try hard,but they just can't get past the hackend script and the lifeless direction!""still"" is worse than the first and even goes so far as to making great leaps over plot holes just to get to the gore!skip it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Well the second is better than the first...,"I hate JLH, and in these films she solidifies her annoyance...but for some reason i actually like the sequel...It's much darker and gorier than the first one. So, I say by the box set because a sequel is nothing without the original, but be prepared to tolerate the original and like the sequel (notice I say like and not love since these movies are far from great)...Brandy is actually a decent actress and is much better than JLH and steals the scenes from under her...All in all it's decent, not great, but worth a watch if your a diehard horror fan..."
2,I still don't wanna know why you did last summer,"I still think a sequel to this was a waste,the producers & director should have done it right the first time.The bad kids'conscience is haunting them again as the looming guy with the rain slicker and (fish hook not a meat hook) this is a 'fish' movie now,continues to stalk them in reality and in their imagination.Oh yeah correct me if i'm wrong..didn't Mr.Rain Slicker(with the fish hook) have his hand torn off in the first movie?I guess it grew back for the sequel. Another poke at fun.. Jennifer Love Hewitt's character better stop dropping ..., I mean was there really a trunk full of crabs?Anywayz this movie is so predictable and unexciting as you'll seeRent it first. Every reviewer has there own critique,,it [stunk]!"
3,Style Over Substance,"OK, first about the films. They are not bad in general, and are certainly very well-produced. The details of the plots just aren't very imaginative. I realize that these are splatter movies, but is it too much to ask that the bar be raised just a little? I mean, how about a thinking person's slaughter-fest?Now, the titles. The first one is almost a self-parody. But the second. Really. ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"". They were actually serious. If they complete the trilogy, I suppose we can look in the coming attractions for ""What Are You Doing Next Summer?"".Like I said, for what they are, these are not bad films. But if you really like this sort of thing, look for ""Final Destination"". It's stupid, too. But it's more fun."
5,Scary!,"I thought that both of the movie's were scary. I'm a big horror movie fan, and I have learned to watch the movies in the dark, at night; I wish I wouldn't have watched these in the dark! The first time I had watched these was when I was 10 and my parents were out with friends at night, and I took the DVD's from their room and watched them. I nearly wet my pants! During the second one I grabbed our butcher knife for protection. And when my parents came home, I heard them pulling up, I was so scared that I hid behind out front door and when they walked in I jumped out and nearly stabbed my dad! But now I am used to them and they are two of my favorite horror movies."
2,CAN WE SAY-CHEESY?,"This late nineties light headed SCREAM/HALLOWEEN teen slasher knock-off is the worst thing to happen to slasher films since the early nineties!!!Part one was decent, except for Sarah Gellar who gets killed again! (Scream 2 and the season finale of Buffy weren't enough?) Part 2 has the annoying, terrible actress Brandi, who only helps the movie however, because she screams alot and the killer almost gets her like 3 times, so she has the 2 scariest scenes...although a decent sequel, the movie just doesn't seem to hold up, weak and meaningless, I think the series is cheap horror for fans of pure C.R.A.P. Please rent first! Don't do the mistake I did!!!"
1,Both [stink]!,Both of these [stink] so bad it's not even funny. Neither one of them are scary. I laughed at both of them and so did all my friends. Skip this...
3,i know pretty good 3 stars i still know pretty bad 2 stars,the first one was fun and really intreging and suspencful and exciting the second was pretty dum i say rent the first maybe rent the second but rent the first you will be happy if you rent the first
5,A Cult Horror Movie,"This is an awesome two movie set-up. Even if the movies weren't scary. I don't care what any of you say, the first one was awesome. Its like one of those movies you could quote any line, from. I mean you got Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah MG, Freddie Prinze Jr, Ryan Phillipe. Its an awesome cast. The second wasn't as good, but hey its still worth watching. And Jack Black is in it, how could you go wrong.I reccomend this movie for people who liked Urban Legends, SCREAM, Idle Hands, and all those other Horror movies from the late 90s. Its essential. Plus Kevin Williamson (Scream; Dawson's Creek) wrote the movie."
4,"5 for 1, 3 for 2","I really enjoyed the original movie. Tons of great actors, and interesting story, and enough twists to keep things interesting. The second movie was more of a typical killer chasing someone an entire movie with a twist at the end. This is a nice set, 2 movies for just a little above what you would pay for 1. If you enjoyed the Scream movies and things like Urban Legends, then this one should be right up your alley."
3,GOOD,I think that the book was good. I have not seen the movie yet but I will probably rent it. I would like to see what is the difference.
4,"""I KNOW"" THIS DVD IS EXCELLENT","I Know What You Did Last Summer is a gripping tale about fear, guilt and suspense Miss Hewitt delivers a great performance. Unfortunately it's sequel has too many plotholes and is missing the touch of the original screenwriter Kevin Williamson. First of all the sequel was given a stupid name. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer takes place two years after the original so a better title would have been I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID or, simply I STILL KNOW. If you want to watch a good movie watch ""I Know"", if you're extremely bored and have nothing else to do, read a book but, don't watch the awful sequel.I KNOW = 4 STARSI STILL KNOW = 0 STARS"
2,Fair but Dated,"This book offers a decent view of Visual Basic development but is lacking in several areas. In addition to a rehash of yesterdays topics, there are several mistakes. It is easy to see an influence from Ted Pattison, but I would suggest reading one of the books authored by him like Programming Distributed Apps with COM+ & VB 6.0. I hope that this book is updated to illustrate real enterprise development practices in the distributed environment of today."
1,I have fallen and I can't get up!,"I hope that Mr. Petit does not attempt to write any other books like REAL Java or REAL C++. If in the event that he does, he may want to learn about applicable software development processes and some fundamentals of distributed computing. I was to irritated after the first hundred pages to continue. Yet another book for the yard sale.So the readers of America really want to know...What was Ted's cut on this one?"
1,Lost in the 80's,Fortunately we have grown past functional decomposition and OO Client Server purism. I believe that Mr. Petit should study Distributed apps and update his book! Stay Away from this one and read a REAL Ted Pattison book!
4,A complete view of project development,"If you want a bid's eye view of the software development process from a VB perspective, this book will fit the bill. The author has lived the process and presents a viable set of best practices to get you through the process. If you want a good reference that will help you be a better developer, then buy this book."
5,Great Looking Watch,I had already bought the Perucci Products before too and I have always loved the way they looked / worked. This one is no exception too ..... I bought it with complete confidence and I loved it. Thank You for such great watches at such prices.
5,Excellent spirit lifter!,"Very nicely done and the lesson it teaches is an excellent spirit lifter. Fail at one thing, win at another. This is something all our children should learn as competition becomes increasingly tough. Even if you fail at something, remember ""You couldn't feel good if you never felt bad"".A very good lesson -- even for adults."
4,VERY HELPFUL!,"I am a hospice chaplain and have numerouspatients who have AZ as well as my own 78yr opld mother.These suggestions (helped by actual suggesteddialogue) are very good and actually work.I intuitively created some of the scenarioswith my mom before I read this book, but I haveused some of their suggestions as well and given thisbook to my father and other older spouses andfriends who have loved ones with AZ. It is anincredibly challenging disease that calls forLOTS of patience and grace...just ""go with it""and you will be blessed with their extraordinarycourage as they learn to cope. My mother knowssomething is wrong with her memory but does notknow what to do about it. Treating her with dignityand respect takes time and thought but the GoldenRule applies at every moment."
3,ALmost but not quite,"This book had a few useful tips but overall I found it only barely useful. It is a rehash of info found nearly everywhere else. It onlytouches,lightly, on the deeper problems of caring for a loved one with alzheimers, I.e. Anger, delusions, obsessive compulsive behavior, fears, etc. it is hard to be ""best friend"" when someone is enraged and threatening to kill you. Granted, these are empty threats and forgotten after a few minutes, but it is still difficult to deal with. OCD is even more difficult when it results in dangerous or difficult to handle behavior.So, bottom line, I am still looking for more helpful onto and guidance."
5,Dementia Care guide,A good book. Excellent suggestions for caregivers. Excellent help in putting the caregiver in the shoes of the person needing care. It makes a bad situation more manageble and rewarding.
1,This a Disposable printer.,"Do not buy this printer!I have had this printer for less than 6 months and it stopped being recoginized by the computer.I called and emailed tech support and since there is only a 90 day warranty, their advice was to purchase another printer.Do not buy this printer!"
1,Re-sale of defective product!,"I guess I was sent one of the defective printers that one of you guys sent back. I'm livid!! As soon as I open the box I could tell it was used. The box was dirty and not taped up. when I open to look at product the cords were not tied up, the ink box was empty, and there was no CD ROM for installation! What a rip off!! At least Amazon has a easy return method. Just got it yesterday, I'm returning today!!"
2,Wasn't Worth The Money,Printer quit after 2 years of very limited use. I only replace the cartridge once. Try some other kind of printer.
3,Yes - The Birth Of A Progressive Rock Legend,"Yes, were a very young inexperienced outfit at the time this album was recorded, but the virtuosity and extreme talent that these guys possessed was evident right from the get go. The debut is far below the creative heights that the band would eventually reach, but the album is a very solid first effort that has held up well over the years. The material is mostly original with the exception of two very unique covers of The Beatles ""Every Little Thing"" and The Byrds ""I See You"". In tracks like ""Harold Land"" you begin to hear the birth of more epic works that Yes would take on later in their career. This one is probably not essential for more casual fans of the band, but it is worth checking out if you already have most of the rest of the band's stuff."
4,Good Clanging Psychedelic Pop-Rock,"The music has drive and flair. They got better later; this is a record that will appeal to committed fans or to fans of psychedelic 60's garage-band music which this is a fine wigged-out example of.Many of the songs center on Anderson's voice and his singing is impressive. For instrumental flair check out the hard-driving ""Beyond and Before"" and the albums two covers (""I See You"" and ""Every Little Thing""), each of which are done with energy and imagination to spare."
2,What happened to the cover photo?,"I have what I think is the remastered version of this cd but not the one with the extra tracks. I'dbe even more reluctant to buy this cd because it doesn't have the great photo of the band in thecemetary. I absolutely love that photo. I think I have a vinyl copy of this album as well. As for theremastered cd, it is just fine with me. I wouldn't mind hearing the extra tracks but I don't really feellike forking out more money just for some bonus tracks. Perhaps the cover photo is the English versionwhich was the first version. Whatever the case, I dig the cemetray photo. The black, blue and pink YESin a dialogue bubble is ok, but I'd rather love at the band and the awesome gravestones in the cemetary.Overall this album is quite good. I listen to it often. It is very pure. Time and a Word is in the same veinbut a lot noisier and more experimental. Both are essential albums for any fan of Yes."
5,The BIG debut of Yes,"This version of the debut sounds lot better than the one remastered by Atlantic. Rhino records is a great company to have reissues of you're favorite classic music groups. The music of the debut sounds good but dosen't really sound progressive rock at that time, they would however sound prog rock when ""The Yes Album"" came out. I recommend this re-issue for a start of a collection."
4,Great debut by Yes,"Yes's debut album was great. Not as good as say ""the Yes album"" or fragile. This cd did not include Steve Howe. But, nonetheless a good cd. Classic yes."
1,Terrible,"I know the product is less than ten dollars, but the quality, both structurally and sound-wise, is not even worth that. The sound quality is extremely poor (muffled) and the pair I received was broken (both sides only played partial amounts of music). I wouldn't take them even if they were free."
1,Winter Wonderland/Point of Grace,I am unable to review this at this time as I have still not received it. Am getting a bit frustrated as it was paid for in full a month ago.
3,The Band....well....almost,"The abscence of Robbie Robertson in the Band has never been a factor. The spirit they possesed in the late 60's and early 70's leading up to ""The Last Waltz"" is.This is undeliably Band music. Levon Helm is a painfully honest vocalist who sings as if he stuck himself with the pen while writing the song. Unfortunately, my favorite song on the CD is their cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Atlantic City"".Overall, the music is still somewhat reverent and merits 3 stars."
3,Not what expected,I purchased this thinking it was the Best of the Band but it isn't. Read the song titles first. I love Levon Helm but this isn't what I expected. This isn't the originial Band and these are not the hits.
3,"Great saint, mediocre biography","It's beyond doubt, that Ammachi belongs among the great saints of Hinduism. But the book is rather mediocre. The first part is the biography, then a small section about her particular spiritual states and then a section of reports of devotees. The main purpose of the biography is to claim the status of an avatar for Ammachi. It shows inummerable problems during the childhood of Ammachi and how she overcame those either with continous sadhana or with miracles. Since Ammachi is shown as beeing above all human feelings and behaviour one cannot really identify with her while reading the book, and even less so with the other actors. From several people I know, I've heard, that Ammachi is an outstanding person. And it's definitely good to read about her life, if one is interested into her or her message."
5,Exploring Issues of Identity Though Literature,"This anthology is a beautifully organized and orchestrated celebration and inquiry into how our identities are shaped and formed by teachers, parents,childhood experiences, and popular culture. The editors ahve chosen work that is so clear and moving that the book is didfficult to put down and no matter where I open it, I find something that moves me or makes me laugh. It has work in it by writers such as Tobias Wolff, Sharon Olds, GAry Soto, Philip Levine, Allen Ginsberg, Diane di Prima, and many other well-known and not-so-well-known writers, but what these writers have in common is their ability to show us some new aspect of our own humanity. This book would make a wonderful text in a writing class and would inspire people who are looking for material for their own writing. It is just fantastic!"
2,A One Note Samba,"There are some excellent stories and writers included, but the introduction to the book, its arrangement, the selections make it disappointing. There are so many authors who should be here who aren't and others who shouldn't who are. These Gillans are a one-note team. Always harping on the same theme in an overdone way. Multicultural literature is a great idea, but the Gillans are always reiterating the same note and tone. One wants to say, ""Get off it!"" The stories individually would have more impact if not a part of this collection. They need to breathe on their own. This collectiont suffocates its own contents to death. I'm sixty-seven and an immigrant myself, but I've read enormously, [though the age marker on this review form is broken and makes everyone 12 or under. I have to say this here, but you can cut the parenthesis.]"
2,Too much of the same whine here.,The Gillans have pounded the theme to death. Nearly every piece is a whine and a complaint. They have created a one-note book which lacks variety of tone. What a pity that a good opportunity was lost and many writers who ought to be in this book are not in it.
4,meet expectations,"Just as expected, this battery charger kit met my expectations!Small, light and easy to use. Just missed an ac-plug integrated in the box, a good idea for travelers! So they won't need to carry the huge ac extension cord."
5,Just what I was looking for.,The charger works great and the batteries last for many pictures. The case is nice too and can also double as a change holder when at amusement parks.
3,It was Pretty good,This Product was Pretty good It didn't give me no trouble or anything charges up fast Actually.It was worth the money I think
3,Very the same with other rechargeble battery,"Actualy, you don't need spend too much money with brand name.You can find other brand with cheaper price and longer capacity."
3,Nikon MH-71 Battery Quick Charger Kit (including case),"Except for one occasion, I have been too busy to use my Nikon Coolpix 5600. I have no comments at present about the batteries and charger since they has not been used. I was disappointed, however, about the case.The camera fits inside the case without problem, but when I opened the case to remove the camera, the velcro pad on the flap ripped off the velcro pad on the case! Only slight or normal pressure had been applied. Clearly, the threads that hold the velcro pad on the case were ineffective.The case is still functional. I will attempt to sew the pad back on, unless I find time to return it under the warranty."
2,Small Plastic charger,"Yes, it works, but looks like a cheaply made plastic charger. Only 2 batteries can charge at a time. I had expected to at least look better coming from Nikon"
5,"Well read, great stories, not politically correct today.","This collection of three of the best known adventures of 007, is a well read collection, but many (especially women) might find them a bit ""politically incorrect"" (i.e., for the treatment of women and so on [but hey, it was the ""swinging '60's"", so you have to put this in context, historically speaking]). I'm not sure if Ian Fleming wrote that famous line in Goldfinger, which is perhaps why it's omitted in this adaption, in the exchange between Bond and him, ""Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?""""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"". (Perhaps, I need to check the text-as I have a print equivalent to both audio sets, or another reader could verify this.) In any case, these are some rousing adventures. Get both volumes, and if you can find them, their print equivalents. I look forward to listening to set two soon."
4,From Russia with Love,"From Russian with Love narrated by an extremely talented voice is well worth the purchase alone. Dr. No didn't quite hold my interest when I tried to listen and I didn't even attempt to listen to Goldfinger but again I highly recommend this for the one tape alone, the Narration is incredible."
1,A total rip-off!,"This ""book"" is a rip-off! I strongly recommend you do NOT buy it. All I can think is that it preys on your inability to see what you are getting before you purchase. Shame on you, Amazon, for even having it on your shelves!You get a set of badly photocopied pages stapled together. The information is less than scant (for example this is what it has to say on Physical Inventory Stock Counting: ""Full count at a defined interval (monthly, quarterly,...)"". That's it!) and in many cases is inaccurate.There are no tools, no algorithms, no formulae. The graphics are straight out of Powerpoint.You will learn nothing from it. Avoid it."
2,disappointing,"I've been looking for a CD of Kempff's own recording of his transcriptions ever since I got rid of my LP collection. It was one of my favorite piano records. I finally decided I'd buy the above CD, based partially on the other review. Big mistake. If this is supposed to be a tribute to Kempff, it certainly doesn't sound that way. Biret's renditions are cold, dull, and usually too fast. Luckily, on a trip to Germany, I found the Kempff version. Don't buy the Biret disc. Instead, have someone in Germany send you the CD of the original (why Amazon doesn't stock it instead of this thing, I don't know). It's on Deutsche Grammophon's Galleria series, and the catalog number is 439 108-2."
3,"Nice, but easily scratched","This tea caddy looks nice and seems sturdy enough except for the outer layer of color. If you even barely touch it with your fingernails or anything harder than that, it will scratch so be very careful."
1,Rock (and Roll) this one out of here,"Of the four CDs in this series, this is arguably the weakest. The others being Jazz:Pop, Jazz:Urban and Jazz:Vocals. Many of the selections included here are older and tired. Many of these songs shouldn't be considered ""contemporary"". True, some songs are timeless, but few of these are. I would say that the other 3 CDs of this set do have more contemporary sounds. My personal favorite it Jazz:Pop."
4,waste can,"I ordered an oval shaped can but received the round one. It is a very nice product- which is why I ordered it, I just am not sure if I made the mistake ordering or if that happened at your end...not a problem either way, but I would have preferred the oval shaped basket."
1,avoid memorex DL R blanks - too many cases of bad blanks,buy verbatim (actually made by TY) instead. I let go on 50 bucks for memorex dl R with bad blanks. Do your own research and verify what I said.
2,pond filter,I thought i read the specs correctly but was surprised to find that this is an out-of-pond filter. i tried it out anyway and it looked good. but after 7-8 weeks it still has not cleared a 450 gal lily pond which only has tiny mosquito fish which we almost never feed. it might be better suited for a smaller pond.
4,Quick & Easy,"The product is exactly as described minus the ""available in multiple colors"" (the seller didn't give a color choice). Also remember due to the nature of this leash, it does double as a choker collar & leash. So with the choker collar qualities it may not be good for all dogs. 4 stars due to the choke qualities; not a great choice for my dog."
2,Pretty Generic,If you've played SE for any length of time you will find that this guide is pretty bland. I was hoping for some insight on creative ways to rack up more points but it really only offers assistance with the maps and a description of why you are in Berlin at the end of WWII.
4,buy it,Tough game.Slow and steady is a must in this game.Have played it many times and is still fun.
4,Dover Thrift Editions Euripide's Medea,"I am teaching a 7th grade drama literature class. What I love about this translation, is that it is very reader friendly, as well as econmical. It has been a wonderful tool to use as an introduction to Greek Tragedy for younger readers.Medea (Dover Thrift Editions)"
4,Medea,"Honestly reading this story overwhelmed me. Considering how short the play is, at the end I found myself mentally and emotionally exhausted. ""Medea"" explores many different themes that are still present in life today. Although I found her undying attachment to Jason annoying, I understood after reading the play how love and revenge can overpower ones mind. I felt as if Euripides toyed with the fact that women are both the weakest and the strongest in relationships. Medea's passion was overwhelming as a reader because I felt like it was a cry for attention rather than a true plea of lost love.Euripides' ""Medea"" although short, is very intense and filled with many emotions. I was lucky enough to see an amazing performance of this play. If done thoughtfully, it can engage you to the point where you sympathize with Medea and are annoyed by her at the same time."
4,Medea...too much woman for me!,"'Medea' by Euripedes is a classic and powerful Greek tragedy that broke all the rules of that time period. Euripedes takes two great figures in Medea and Jason, and uses Iconoclastic techniques brilliantly to make Jason seem stupid and Medea seem like a murderer. It is especially interesting because of the story that you need to understand outside of the play. You will need to know who the gods are and how Medea and Jason got together. Medea is a powerful sorceress, which is a major point in this play. The imagery of the death scenes were VIVIDLY scripted and the gods, who are supposed to represent all that is good and rightous, are also mocked and bashed by Euripedes. Overall, Euripedes defied all and created a tragic masterpiece, I will definately recommend you to read this. Thank you."
4,Great Buy!!,This book is an absolute bargain at this price and the shipping was super fast. This translation is great for younger readers and speaks to them in an easily understandable tongue.
3,20th Anniversary - Carlos Vives,"I am one of his biggest fans but I know now that Carlos does not have it for the romantic music. He is just great in the ""vallenatos"" type of music. The letters are wonderful with a lot of feeling and beautiful music but in romantic style he does not have it. I even had to return a romantic CD once because I did not like it. However, I love all the others and I have all of them. He is a great Colombian representative of the ""vallenato music"""
4,What's Christie done wrong?,"This book is about Christie having problems with her science teacher, Miss Finney, at her new school in London. Christie's always made fabulous grades, especially in science, and suddenly she's gettting D's and C's. The problem is, Christie KNOWS she's doing all her assignments right, Miss Finney is purposely NOT being fair. Christie doesn't know what to do, until she hears about the school's annual science fair and decides that by winning it, she can prove herself to Miss Finney.This book was sort of boring to me, but I still liked it. Sideplots are: Christie trying to figure out what to do about Chase and Connie- she likes them both, but is it realistic to not date Connie here in England because she likes Chase still, even though she might never see Chase again? AND Jana is writing to Christie asking for advice on whether she should break up with boyfriend, Randy, who she's been dating for a year or so."
5,This is a good read!,"All the characters are three dimensional and well developed (not just the heroine, the hero is wonderful, too.) I got that ""lump in the throat"" feeling when I came to the last page, which tells me that Ms. Wright really knows how to tell a story. I recommend this book."
1,Product didn't work for me,I purchased Hylexin for the dark skin that surrounds my eyes. I used it faithfully and did not see any results at all. It was a total waste of money & time.
3,More dictionary than good guide,"I only gave the third star because it is immense. Otherwise, the book reads like a dictionary and an old one at that! The book only lists mines where these minerals can be found and this is not surprising since the author works for the Nevada Bureau of Mines. One instance tells of one mine that a certain mineral can be found and lists it as extremely rare. If this is the case, I will be rich soon because I can find 6X the specimen size within 10 minutes of my house without digging.The photos are nice but there are not enough to do any justice to the book. A better layout would have been to include photos with the descriptions. I don't recommend this book unless you have the time to research photos of each item (thousands), print them and add them to the book. You will also spend years writing to the claim owners to get permission to look for these but good luck trying to keep your own specimen."
3,INTERESTING STORY,"Interesting and well acted story about a dedicated 16-year-old student in London, England circa 1961 who is swept off her feet when she meets much older guy (Saarsgard). As their relationship grows, she realizes her goals of finishing school and going to Oxford are useless as the new man in her life teaches her about having a comfortable life without working. But when she discovers who he really is she realizes everything comes at a price. The movie raises important questions about women and what society expects of them. And even though the movie is set at the beginning of the 60s, these questions are still valid today. Mulligan is the most beautiful thing I've seen on the big screen in a very long time. Solid entertainment."
5,better than expected,"This movie is very witty. When you know people who have lived this life the story isn't unbelievable as some have said in their reviews. I will be adding ""An Edcuation"" to my collection."
2,predicatable,"Mediocre, predictable, young girl seduced by older man who turns out to be married.But I have to hand it to Peter Saarsgard. A great performance, a long way from Boys Don't Cry. I didn't realize he was that good an actor."
3,Nice atmosphere,"It isn't so much ""an education"" as it is a teenage girl's fantasy, and as such it doesn't go very far. What was ostensibly Jenny's awakening pretty much becomes a period costume drama, capturing early 60s suburban London. I thought Carey Mulligan was very good as Jenny but you found out little about the other characters, including her parents who seemed a bit too gullible for such prim and proper Brits. Peter Sarsgaard adopts a disaffected attitude which seems to suit his character David, but not much to hang a hat on.There are many ways a story like this could have turned but in the end opts for a rather soft fall for young Jenny. I would have thought a girl with her ""smarts"" wouldn't have been so easily taken either. Palling around with David and his well-dressed friends would be good for a few kicks and set her above her classmates, but hard to imagine she was ready to throw her future away for this guy. Molina and Thompson are little more than props in this movie."
4,Great ... until the ending,"I found this movie to be very engrossing and well executed until the end, when the mystery and suspense that had been progressively built up was resolved in a manner which I found entirely unsatisfying and implausible. Because of this disappointment, I don't really have much more to say about this movie, other than mentioning that perhaps the primary lesson is that our bias towards believing what we want to believe renders us vulnerable to being deceived. The bottom line is that I wouldn't necessarily advise against watching this movie, but beware of the problem I've noted."
4,An Education is a must see movie!!,"This is a jewel of a movie. The acting is magnificent and again it shows how great British are.After all the junk that is being put out now, this movie, gives you the feel of really having enjoyed watching a great film."
4,Get An Education,"Based on an article in Granta by British journalist Lynn Barber, An Education is a tremendously well acted film about a precocious sixteen year old who is seduced by a dashing thirty something who takes her on whirlwind romance only for her to discover that he is a married con man. Carey Mulligan stars as Jenny the young girl in what was a star making turn. She is absolutely charming and winning in the role and she received a well deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination. Peter Sarsgaard is David the con man and he gives a smooth, icy performance that was definitely worthy of a nomination despite one not being received. The film is set in England in the early 1960's and the plot seems completely unplausible except for the fact that is based on Ms. Barber's actual experiences from the time. The film was nominated for Best Picture and Nick Hornby's sharp script picked up a Best Adapted Screenplay nod."
3,Solid but formulaic,"Coming of age story set in 1960's England. Alfred Molina gives another superb performance as the dominant yet loving father who is at odds with his bright teenage daughter. Young Carey Mulligan does a fine job blossoming from naive schoolgirl to young woman. Peter Sarsgaard is convincing as the seductive, though suspicious older David, who sweeps Jenny off her feet.In some ways, the conflict between what Jack wants for his daughter (stability) and what Jenny thinks she wants (David's glamorous, though somewhat shady lifestyle) parallels the 1960's. The conventional life of the 1950's was giving way to rock-and-roll and a greater sense of freedom/curiosity.Unfortunately, although the actors do a good job and the cinematography is solid, the movie is rather formulaic."
3,Gullible Parents - not very believable,"PROSIt was beautifully filmed with pretty backdrops of paris and london streets. Jenny gets to dress glamorous for a while, which is also fun to watch. She gets to grow up by realizing that a man isn't everything. I was pleasantly surprised that this movie wasn't all about sex, like i initially thought. And i think this was good because it allowed the viewer to focus on the real purpose of this movie.*Potential spoiler for those who haven't watched the movieCONSI don't find it very believable, that Jenny's dad who was ""allegedly"" strict, fell for David's lies and allowed him to whisk his daughter away. I don't think many dads would allow their underage daughter to go out with a much older man. Therefore, it seemed like a far stretch.CONCLUSIONIt was a descent movie. Its good enough to watch once."
1,Caution when purchasing this item.,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Hellsing Ultimate, and am very satisfied with the quality of the disc content. That's not where my complaint lies, and I will truthfully admit my dissatisfaction is partially my fault.However, vol. 2 is supposed to be packaged with an accompanying art book, some 200 pages of content, which is not included in this purchase through Amazon. Look around a little more before purchasing this particular version of the steel book sets, and find the one with the art book please.Well, unless you're completely indifferent to extra packaging. If you are, then I suppose it doesn't make much of a difference."
3,"Book well written, subject disappointing","I lost interest in the subject of this well-written book as she seemed not to be in any way extraordinary, except for her wealth and indulgent lifestyle, her ""Crowded Hours."""
3,Tight on the heel,"These are cute shoes, but they run small. I got the black size 8 1/2 because there is no zipper you simply slide the shoe on its very very tight on the heel, not sure if i will return or simply stretch them."
1,What a disappointment,What a disappointment these shoes were...they look so cute online. Unfortunately you have to have a foot/ankle shaped like Barbie's to even squeeze your foot into these things. I am a very regular size 7.5 - I ordered a size 8 after reading the other review. I seriously couldn't even get my foot into the bootie - I'm not sure an 8.5 would have even worked because the ankle opening is so small and without zippers/buttons or much stretch. So sad. I returned these without even being able to put them on my feet. No sense in even trying a larger size as they werer so far off.
4,"Glossy, thin and large two","As with the other ""Eyewitness"" books on various subjects, this book is also endowded with outstanding photography. The information is still minimal and based on the more popular material most folks are familiar with with the Native American. A good starter book for the yonger reader looking for some information on our American Natives............"
3,Too Much of the Author,"The book is an interesting look into the lost and forgotten places of the New York Underground. There is a lot of history presented by the author which is interesting and insightful.However, after the book starts exploring the author's expeditions, it sort of becomes like watching a relative's slide show of their recent RV trip. The photographs become ""Here I am in [x aqueduct]"" and ""Here I am in [x tunnel]."" In other words, the book loses its focus on being informative, and rather focuses on the author herself."
4,underground review,Excellent book if you are looking for the real stories behind (or below) the streets of NY. Nicely written. Sticks to the facts and the author's impressions of the scenes did not affect the character of the book. The photographs are amazing! If you want a good introduction into the NY underground this is the place to start.
5,Great Book and Love it! Has Raw and cooked recipies in it!!!!,Great Book and Love it! Has Raw and cooked recipies in it!!!! It is really good info in it and a text book requirement for our classes! I preasonally feel this should be in every organic/health contious home!
5,Secrets of the Ennegram,The most powerful book I've found on the secrets of the sufi orders. Truely a hidden jewel i wish many more would read this work of art.
5,A real and poignant adventure,"This is one of my favorite children's novels of all time - it is absolutely unique in its portrayal of boys during adolescence. It was translated in Bulgarian along with three other of Kastner's novels and as such it comprised one of the most read collections for kids for more than 4 generations. Even today, every average Eastern European seems to know about the story and considers it close to their heart. And as for me, I was in love with Martin for a few years, at least!And as comic moments go, the little Uly sitting in the trashcan which dangles from the ceiling, as his father, the teacher, is wondering aloud what kind of parents allow their son to miss school, has to come in the top ten."
4,These look beautiful!,"One dropped right into a guitar like they were made for each other! I had to block sand the other a little to get it to fit my other guitar. They didn't eliminate feedback problems but there was definitely a noticeable reduction. To be fair, I chose the mild version. Lute hole also offers medium and heavy feedback reductions as well, so you may want to consider those as an option."
3,"Too ""Average""","I went out and bought this album as soon as I heard ""Average Kid"". Bad mistake. ""Average Kid"" is great, and so is ""Boy in the Bubble"" but the rest of the songs are unspectacular and overly catchy. It was a dissapointment for me. Not a bad album, just not a great album."
5,great product,excatly what i ordered. great looking product. gave it to my husband as a christmas gift and he loved it. a lot cheaper than what i saw at the mall sold for $40.00. loved the price and quality.
4,"Good, but overly complicated","Great book if you want to learn about Q. One of the few sources out there to learn this great research technique. However, the book makes things out to be more complicated than necissary. If you want to learn about the method its a good starting point, but I would recommend finding a live source to help explain it."
2,"Russian history, not Catherine history",This book is so dry...very hard to finish. It tells very little about Catherine. Way too much about Russian history leading up to her rule.
2,"coloring, a poster and a game","This might be a fun coloring book for Dora fans, though the format is strange. The book comes with a centerfold that pulls out to become a poster, game pieces and a board that become a matching game, and seven two-page spread coloring pages that depict party scenes. The coloring scenes are all on top of each other, so the book must be completely disassembled. There are only a few words of text, and no story.This book isn't that great but I'd give it an average rating for Dora fans who like to color, except that the paper quality is poor too."
4,Personality with a humorous twist,"Journey by Bill Keis is a tasteful CD with memorable melodies. This CD is not a bunch of musicians showing off ""chops"" as I hear in most contempory jazz CD's. The CD explores swing, fusion and latin feels; Keis is comfortable and conversant in each style. As the last song finishs, you want for more. I highly recommend this to the listener who is interested in hearing an up and coming luminary."
5,A Human's-eye View,"Yes, this book is mostly about Shuna, a human. But the story is told with the same clever style as all Pini's work, and seeing the elfin world through human eyes adds a whole new dimension to it. Through Shuna's trials and mistakes, we learn more about Pini's elves' culture. Plus, the art is beautiful and the characters just as charming as ever. 5 Stars, Pini!"
1,Not what it used to be,"The art is beautiful, but soulless. Wendy Pini has traded in her talent for the supposed time-saving use of Adobe Photoshop, and boy does it show. Characters are flat and lifeless, with no lively spark.The story itself is garbage. So much is forgotten, overlooked, or just plain wrong that I don't have enough space list it all. Anyone remember Suntop? How about the two trolls who went along with Cutter and the rest on the Shards quest? And remember when Timmain said that the spirits of the Wolfriders didn't reside in the palace, but in the land?Don't worry if you don't remember, Wendy and Richard don't, either."
3,Story false art is pleasing,"While, beggers cant be choicers. Its good just to see some of the old characters again done in the beautiful art you can expect from Wendy Pini. The story leaves a lot to be desired. Its done in a narrative and is ridiculously short. You cant place when this is happening you keep asking yourself where is this character where is that character from all the old stories. But if you are knew to the ElfQuest scene you will still have just as many question but may what to know more. The book is a eyecatcher more than a catcher of the imagination."
2,SAD,"wow this was a terrible story and the computer coloring was HORRIBLE. I feel terrible that Wendy Pini had really lost her touch. There are no fine details, and its just sloppy."
2,Not worth the wait,"This story reads more like a fan decided to write themselves into the story and simply add in the favorite characters here and there as a way to interact with them. The story is jerky with no good explanations as to why certain things have happened. For instance, why do we suddenly have the spirit of Strongbow and Moonshade's slain daughter fore-telling of mutant trolls and her mother's forth coming pregnancy. And a long missing elf suddenly pops up out of nowhere and it is no big deal. And at times, the story reads more like a public service message for abused women. The elves are totally out of the character that was developed for the last 20 years. This lack of effort on Wendy Pini's part is truly disappointing."
5,I loved it!,"Despite all the negative feedback, I was quite taken with the story and was NOT dissapointed ( after a VERY impatient wait to read it )The story has taken a different turn from those of the previous EQ novels, but it was not done in a distasteful way. The introduction of Shuna as a main character was only natural for the Pini's, since from the very begining the Elves have been trying to find a ballance with humans! It makes you dare to hope that, with Shuna acting as a mediator, that ballance will someday be found!Im even more eager to read what comes next! Oh and as for the art, I think its beautiful! And its been LONG overdue to see some more of Wendy's beautiful art IN COLOR even!!!"
3,Liked it,"I read this last night and I thought it was pretty good - not incredible, but decent.Maybe I was more pleased with it because I had just finished reading the EQ New Blood ""Forevergreen"" series which was HORRIBLE and a complete waste of time, and in comparison this was a breath of fresh air! Or maybe it's because I welcome any chance to read about Cutter's tribe; Cutter and the Wolfriders will always mean much more to me than any other EQ characters, and I enjoyed the chance to just interact with all those old friends again, especially as drawn (and inked) by the creator of Elfquest, Wendy Pini. I thought the artwork was very nice, unlike some other reviewers.There were some unrealistic plot elements, like Kimo being able to shapeshift, the strangely crazed trolls, and Ahdri coming back to life. But overall I thought it was more enjoyable than not."
4,Pretty For The Price,"This is a pretty piece for the money and quite large. I can tell it's not high-end crystal because it has more bubbles than I'd like, but I fill it with potpourri and it looks great."
4,The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders,"If you take this version of Moll Flanders and compare it to the other versions, the other ones are better. But if you take this film and place it amongst other movies (not Moll Flanders-related), this film is pretty decent.It's not a drama, if that's what you're thinking. It's actually a bawdy comedy, and I have to disagree with other viewers. This film has sort of a Monty Python/Three Stooges thing going on here which actually makes the movie interesting and funny for everyone...even the kiddies! I have little brothers and they love Jemmy's sidekick in this!Well-casted, well-acted...it's actually pretty good. There isn't really anything wrong with this that made me lower the star rating - I just find it's not the best movie in the world. But I still love it. Hehe."
2,"A Kim Novak Movie, for a change","Usually, whenever I've encountered Ms. Novak, she was part of somebody else's movie, ""Vertigo"" starring James Steward or ""Pal Joey"" starring Frank Sinatra. This time, she stands alone--and it's not very outstanding at all, I'm afraid.Likes like a ""Tom Jones"" rip-off, and a very un-funny one at that. I had had great hopes for George Sanders, but even he can't bolster up this Tom Turkey.What a shame, too, because the book ""Moll Flanders"" is so interesting. Well, I guess you can take THAT out of the library if you really have to."
1,Another female-victim & male rescuer story...,"PUH-leeeze! Jana has some growing up to do. Why does she get so jealous every time she sees Randy so much as talk to another girl? What if, in worst case scenario, Randy and Laura had been having a fling for real? Is Jana that petrified of losing Randy that she runs out into the street on impulse Jana comes across as the victim again."
2,"O.K., but...","This had great sound, but I experienced two things that other reviewers cited:- The motor noise was annoyingly loud- The changer started eating CDs/DVDs, then broke entirelyI think I'm done with changers completely"
5,great product,I use this dressing over my iv line and it keeps the site covered and clean. It secures the line very well even while sleeping!
4,Great book to have on hand,I can't honestly say that I have tried everything or even most things in this book but I can say that it is a great book to have on hand. It has great ideas for all kinds of home remedies that I have never heard of. It is a wealth of valuable information.
2,Not what I expected,"Most of the book gives you information on specific fruits and veggies and what ailments they are supposed to alleviate. The basis for most of the claims are based on his travels to different parts of the world and from the ""folk"" medicine he came across. I don't think that folk medicine is completely without merit, but I also don't think it should be the total basis of recommendations for treating certain diseases. additionally, if want recipes for juicing, you'd better have a vitamix machine because all the recipes he provides are for use in that particular machine. I bought an omega juicer and all the recipes in the book are useless to me."
5,Grest resource,I bought this book shortly after a purchase of a new machine. It was a great resource to other books on living a more clean and health life. I highly recommed it
3,"Amerock BP1950H-B Metal Finishes Knob Solid Brass, 1-1/4-Inch Diameter","I really only needed one, but thought I would get two so I would have a spare. Lucky I did, as one of them was dented and therefore unusable."

3,different media code?,"these aren't the same ones i've bought in the past at Sam's Club, the media code is different, forget what they were...made three coasters already...only bought it b/c Amazon had a sale...stick to Ritek/Ridata's"
3,Still waiting,"I purchased this item for my SONY dvd recorder from Recording Store through Amazon Market Place. They had the recordable discs that I needed. I decided to upgrade my SONY to a newer, better dvd recorder and canceled this item 7 August 2007. It is now 13 September 2007; I am still waiting for my refund from Recording Store."
4,Excellent Media at an Excellent Price after Rebate,"Even though you can get off-brand stock for perhaps a dime per piece less, this is harrd to beat -- (...). No coasters."
1,Velocity Bait and switch,"It doesn't matter what DVD+ writer I used, Velocity worked! Not one disk became a coaster. I loved the Velocity DVD-R until I order 2 more spindles. I ordered it directly for the manufacture. When I received it, the outside plastic covering was cracked, half the Disks had the jitters and the other half was coasters. It seems to me that they trick you into ordering one with a great offer including free shipping. If you order any more, the person shipping it to you send you the rejects from quality assurance. I will never again order this product again period!!"
2,Some dvd players can't read the printable version of this brand.,The printable version of verbatim can't be read by some dvd players. I have panasonic and jvc dvd players and they can't read them. However the xbox dvd player can without a problem.It's the first time I buy this brand. Maybe I'll try the ones without the printable surface.I've always purchased Ritek and never had a problem. I purchased a 50 spindle of ridata 16x and have not had a problem yet on 30 of them yet. I usually burn at no faster than 12x anyways.
3,Not great,"Too many coasters, however not sure if it's the discs, my computer or the software. So use your judgement."
2,MCC Disks...50% are bad,Warning ! There are MCC disks** INFO : Disc = [DVD-R:MCC 02RG20 ]I had about 50% Disk failure rate with my NEC DVD_RW ND-3500AG and not sure how long the others will last...I just hope that the rebate comes thru...I will never buy these againPat
1,Three in a row made as data dvd,"Well, so far so bad... I burned the DVDs on my Panasonic DVD recorder. They play in my newer DVD players, but I cannot make a copy of them with Sonic DVD, Nero, or One click DVD. UNacceptable! I have used many types of DVDs, never had this happen. I guess I know why some DVDs I have purchased are playable, but not copiable.. it is the media! I will stick with Maxell,or TDK."
3,Verbatim 8x 4.7 GB DVD-R Spindle (100 Discs,I have purchased the mentioned disks and I spent more thanI thought was the best price (Sams club sells the same item for$20.00 Less). It is my fault for not being a good shopper.I do not blame the seller.As far as quality of the product it is OK
5,"Panasonic 58"" Plasma TV","I am very satisfied. I ordered the tv Dec. 16 ,and it was at my door Dec 21. I saved over $800,including the 4 year warranty. I didn't pick the lowest price . I picked the Amazon price for a few dollars more. I decided what I wanted , and Amazon delivered in spades. The TV is great. HDTV for a $40 hd antenna is a deal. The Panasonic TV s ending in 600 are supposed to have a better sound system. Probably reccomended if you don't have a surround sound system ,and depending on your room size. 60 series is ok . You will be happy.....(.3/2011.....NO WARRANTY NEEDED HERE.)"
5,Great TV,"I've had this TV for about 3 years now, and it is still going strong. It is kind of dated now, being only 720p instead of 1080p, but if you are looking to see if the Panasonic Plasmas hold up for a few years, I can tell you they do. I can't remember having any problems with it, and the TV's remote control supports discrete code, so it is easy to program into my Pronto. Based on my experience, I would buy a new Panasonic if they would come out with a 72"" version."
4,Big TV,"Good tv,but very big. Picture is sharp and clear. Set up was a challenge due to weight of set. We wall mounted it and it was more than a two man job to lift it onto mount and organize the cables.Amazon was very late on their free delivery service...by almost a week. Freight company was not helpfule finding shipment."
5,Life changing book!,This inspiring book improved every aspect of my life. It's a common sense approach that doesn't ask you to join some Covey-like cult. I highly recommend it for anybody looking to refocus on the really important things in life. Whether you're struggling right now or think you've got it made this book will offer ways to enhance your life every day. It's an easy read too!
4,Another Winner for Jason!,"Jason Falkner delivers another winner with I'M OK YOU'RE OK. It's been a long wait since his last solo album, but certainly worth the wait. This album is way more than 'OK.' Probably the most prolific of the ex-Jellyfish-ers. Pure pop the way it's meant to be played. You won't be disappointed by this. Hopefully it will get an American release soon. The Japanese release has a nice bonus track. Way to go, Jason. Also check out TV EYES, the New Wave influenced project he did with Jellyfish founding member, Roger Joseph Manning Jr."
4,Okay By Me,"I usually like to write fairly involved CD reviews, but I'm in the middle of three things, and only just stumbled across this album review page. The thing is, I've had this album for a while, and it's perhaps the only JF album that didn't have to grow on me. Oh, sure, the previous albums had individual tracks that grabbed me, but the albums as a whole were less than best for me. I'm OK... You're OK just grabbed me right out of the box. It's a lush, beautifully conceived album, and I find myself going back to it quite a bit. It might not affect everyone the same way. My pop tastes have become pretty particular over the years. But for me, this is one of his finest efforts. I didn't give it five stars, but that's only because the songs 'Author Unknown' and 'All God's Creatures' are on another album. ;)"
4,A Superb Effort from an Artist that Deserves More Attention.,"I've been a Jason Falkner fan since his days with Jellyfish in the early 1990's. He features quite prominently on my list of criminally under appreciated artists out there. This album is not a huge departure from Jason's previous work and shouldn't disappoint his fans. This, an album nine years in the making, is a decidedly more mature effort than his last record both in lyrics and approach. Gorgeous melodies and poignant lyrics make this a worthwhile addition to any fan's collection, even at the inflated Japanese import price tag. Snag it while it's still available. One of Jason's best. Why it never got a proper release here in the United States is a bit of a head scratcher."
2,"So,so close, Mad. But you're still a loser.","Seriously, people, you should all take a step back and munch on some honestly pills. =\This book's art is brilliant, its story is whack. Period. Any moron who's seen final fantasy knows that all of the characters are inderect ripoffs. Scratch that... it's not so much the characters are ripoffs as much as the entire book is a cliche'. ^^Joe Mad, for me, is the biggest douche in history (next to Miller). He has so much talent, but he wastes it. And the objectifying every woman in the book? yeah... when they say this piece of crap has something for everyone, they mean everyone. pedophiles, rapists, little tweens having their ""happy hands"" time... everyone.If you like this sort of stuff, then you'll definitely get a fix with Battle Chasers. But its worth only goes as far as its initial and oh-so-small buzz."
4,"The Variations are a masterpiece, superbly recorded.","While the Dance Suite and Piano concerto both have many enjoyable moments and are well crafted, the finest work here is the Variations for Orchestra. Stevens writes in an accessible tonal language with a slight serial bent. The Variations are gritty and terse on first hearing but they stand up very well to repetition. You feel you are in the presence of a first rank composer who knew his stuff and deserved wider exposure. Strongly recommended.Very good natural recording and well played."
4,SUPER Soft and Snuggly -- Fantastic Blanket!,"This blanket is so soft that my 8-month old would fall fast asleep when I wrapped us in it; so much so that I had to go and buy the baby size for him!!! Now his has become HIS blankie, and mine is OUR blankie! And it comes out of the wash just as soft and velvety as it went in, which is more than I can say for my Little Giraffe blankets! My only complaint, and it's a teeny one, is that there were a bunch of loose threads hanging from the border and I had to snip them all off, but I guess that is more the norm than the exception these days. This would be a great shower gift for any Mommy-to-Be!!!"
4,Nice blanket,We got this as a gift (actually by accident when someone misread our baby wish list and got this instead of the Sleep Sheep) but it is a really nice plush super soft blanket. The very browny sage green doesn't really go with our nursery but it's great for an extra layer when traveling or for a soft surface to put the little one down on
3,One great track,"I (rather unexpectedly) found this EP in a record shop in SLC, and picked it up because I remembered hearing the Lo Fidelity All Stars remix of ""God is Going To Get Sick of Me"" on KEXP's morning show a couple of times.Well, at the end of the day, that track is still great. The other tracks are... fine, I guess, but mostly forgettable."
3,Mildly disappointing,"I found this book to be mildly disappointing. If you are looking for a general, historical overview of the development of Japanese religion (without much central focus on Shinto), this book would be for you. The author manages to submerge the actual discussion of the Shinto religion into a background of the historical development of its relationship to Buddhism and Confucianism. This history is important, but for those looking for direct detailed information about Shinto beliefs, rituals, kami, (in short, Shinto itself) I would look elsewhere. Some important historical context is learned from this book, but it does not succeed much in portraying a vivid descriptive account of the Shinto faith. Kasulis' theory of the ""existential vs. essentialist"" approach of religion I found wholly uninteresting; either he is defining terms too finely or choosing the wrong terms to label them. I could recommend this book only of background historical, contextual importance only,"
5,"A most unusual mystery, Will keep you up late reading.","Be prepared to be up late reading! This book grabs you, and doesn't let go. Elizabeth Strong is a top-notch corporate software executive, at the top of the world until she hears the voice that leads her to the dark side of life, full of revenge. Elizabeth soon becomes enmeshed with many characters from the wrong side of the tracks. There is Beulah, the bag-lady, Zipper, the underworld crime boss, who takes Elizabeth under his wing, and Hendrix, Zipper's bodyguard. Elizabeth becomes obsessed with killing her father. This obsession leads her to try other murders, and she finds she likes it! Detective Kyla Gillespie is assigned the job of unraveling the murders. No easy task. It's hard to believe this is the author's first book. She has designed such wonderful characters, and skillfully leads us through the path between insanity and reason. It may be a first book, but this reader will anxiously await more. The sooner, the better!"
2,"A valiant attempt, but there needs to be more","I saw this author at a book signing and having met her, I dearly wanted this book to be as fun as she was.Unfortunately, I was disappointed.There are some bright spots, and she does take chances with her character, but there are some dialogue problems and the story is a bit jumbled.The plot idea, though, is very good. I still recommend it as something different from the seemingly formulaic offspring of even today's biggest writers."
2,not as described,"Bike did not have twist grip shifters, and its too much of a hassle to send back and wait for a refund. Other that that its a cheap bike that looks like it won't last very long! don't buy!!!!! theres better bikes at Wal-Mart"
1,Has anyone read the book?,I am looking to find out what the book is about and some more information on it.
4,Track listing,1. Birth [6:15]2. Life Between The Exit Signs [6:48]3. Trust [6:57]4. Somewhere Before [6:39]5. Gypsy Moth [8:20]SPARS CODE: AAD(c) 1990 JCI
4,DELIGHTFUL,"This delightful light classic opera, bears the undertones of Mozart and Rossini. It is a shame that it is not known and played more often."
1,The Many Faces of Death,"This movie was totally not what I expected. I felt like I was watching an episode of Cops or maybe this should be called ""The Ambulance Chasers,"" or ""Highway Accidents."" What I expected to see was a pathologist review of the many faces of death. What I got was the camera tape from highway accidents and police reports."
2,Itsy bitsy is right!,"Okay, so technically the ad copy didn't lie: ""So much cuteness packed into 3 inches!"" But for $12.99 I wasn't expecting a toy quite this minuscule. It's cute, it's a skunk, it's fairly soft, but it's definitely ""Itsy Bitsy."""
3,"A little ridiculous at times, but also chilling at times","You have to take a lot of this book with a grain of salt, but pretty much all of what you read in this book could some day happen, especially global warming, which despite what the expert below says, IS HAPPENING (and I am a conservative republican!!!). The Cyberterrorism chapter was probably the most ridiculous. But it is still interesting and chilling to read."
2,No depth but fun and closer to reality than our government,"This is a quickly produced book that is an easy read on a plane. It will not give you any kind of depth on any of the issues and there are no refs to enable you to check anything. He covers asteroids, WMD's, greenhouse effect, ice ages, volcanos, plagues, insects, bioengineering, cyberterror and, presciently, tsunamis. He does not mention overpopulation, supernovas or the Doomsday Hypothesis(the seemingly absurd but quite serious idea that on general gounds alone it is likely we have lived half our total span as a species). His chapter on volcanos does not mention thatYellowstone Park in the USA isthe worlds biggest caldera. To his credit he does take the greenhouse effect seriously and he was writing at least 3 years ago. If onlythe average citizen and thegovernment had the same good sense."
1,Exploitation at it's worst,"This book completely exploits people's fears to make a dollar. The problem with the book isn't whether or not the scenarios are valid or not (although there is a valid debate to be had there). It's that the scenarios aren't put in perspective. As far as I am concerned, this problem pretty much negates the validity of the who thing.It's the equivalent of telling an agoraphobe about all of the ways they could be mugged while going to the grocery store. Could it happen? Yes. Is it likely? No. Are you doing them a favor? Certainly not. Mr. Moran isn't doing the public any favors either."
2,Just a book of quotes,"This LITTLE book (roughly 2 inches by 3 inches) is just a collection of quotes about cigars by mostly famous people, interspersed with only 10 actual tips on cigar smoking etiquette and methods. A short entertaining bathroom read, but by no means is this a guide or ""instruction"" manual."
4,Philosophy and Film Class,"I had to order this book for a Philosophy and Film online class, which fulfills my upper level Philosophy requirement. It is a very extensive book that contains articles and excerpts from numerous prominent film critics and theorists. Many of the readings are very old (from the beginning of the film era) so they are a little dense to read, but they are very interesting and informative nonetheless."
5,Great for fans,"This is a good quality polyester beanie with the P! emblem embroidered on the front and the FLCL logo on the back (or vice versa if you wish). It's more of a skull cap type beanie as it doesn't completely cover my ears. Fans owe it to themselves to own this, a t-shirt, and the yellow coffee mug."
2,Moving along...ZZZZzzzzzz,"The book was like read reading a history lesson with a political motivation. Too many loose ends combined with then endless typos, that plague all Mayer's ebooks, make this attempt at entertainment luke warm at best.Save your money.Will"
3,Deja Vu all over again!,"Good read by itself but but almost a ""carbon copy"" of a sub-plot in Area 51: The Mission. Obviously, took that part and expanded upon it to create this book using a lot of cut and paste work - some scenes being practically identical except for names. Each book is good and I'm not sure this is a ""bad"" thing. Enjoyed both, but it was more of an ""editorial"" enjoyment on this one - seeing how he changed and expanded upon the previous to come up with a different twist. Quinn becomes an ally whereas, in The Mission, his archetype is killed by Turcotte (Riley)."
4,green beret series,"I can relate to the stories, as I was in that branch of service.I find that most every thing I have red so far is realistic .I have read 3 other books in the Green Beret series and find them all as being good."
3,Somewhat Helpful,"The Strategy Guide basically consists mostly of profiles for each of the main characters. Included in these profiles are some rather trivial piece of personal information about each of the characters as well as the recommended attacks to use with that particular character. However, I believe the guide doesn't give you enough help when it comes to unlocking features of the game. To unlock these features, certain conditions have to be met. For the most part, most of these features are listed with the conditions needed to unlock them. However, I think the guide should have done a better job of explaining what you need to do in order to unlock certain events, armor types, and weapons.This guide is somewhat useful. The artwork is very attractive. And would be worthwhile purchase for those who collect them. However, there are many other sources of information online that you could go to if all you need is help with the game."
5,SUOL CALIBUR III - IS THE BEST OF ALL SOUL CALIBURS,I loved this guide. That is such a complete guide. The details of the characters are incredibles and the photos... GREAT.I recommend this for everybody.
1,Junk,I was hoping for a versatile tool but it turns out to be junk. The blow gun wand doesn't work no matter how much I mess with it. Nothing comes out of it and I can't figure out why. The air chuck lets out so much air it's hard to tell if you're getting any in. I'm now doing what I should have done in the first place and buy quality separate pieces.
4,Bleach Uncut Box Set 5,The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view
2,Just Another Wallet Succubus Anime Series!!!,Sure the series started out being interesting but somewhere after Rukia's rescue ... it became just another dull & boring series like Inuyasha. Sure there's great battle scenes and new villains but is there ever any doubt who will win the final outcome (No!). This series is apparently aimed at the little kiddies now because its now just one mindless battle after another (reminds me of Dragonball Z).If your looking for a anime series with substance .... look elsewhere because this certain isn't it!If your looking to blow some serious cash .... oh yeah .... this is definitely your series ... rotflmao!
3,Not necessary but it is.,"This finishes the Bount Arc and that's about it. It's filler so you can skip it, but I wouldn't recommend it because later on in the canon series, they make a couple of references to the Bounts and if you didn't watch this you may get a little lost, but if you've read the manga then you know that the Bounts don't even exist so it's your call altogether. It's good but nothing great. Ichigo pulls something out of his butt yet again in the final fight."
3,GIft,"was a gift for my grandkids, assume they liked it, never heard anything different, good place to buy quickly needed items"
5,Vuela Vuela,Magneto is a group that brings back memories from my childhood. IT was constantly played at parties and my mom is dancing like crazy to this song. Buy it and you wont be sorry. It is great music
1,Stay Away,"Excuse me, I thought this book was supposed to be by a RACE CAR DRIVER! What is all this nonsense about caped rats? If I wanted to read a comic book I'd SHOOT MYSELF! The logo thing on the cover looks sort of like chrome, that's about the only reason I am giving this book one star. If you are a Mark Martin fan like me AVOID THIS BOOK! Because it is NOT a book. It is a COMIC BOOK! You have been warned. I wish someone had warned me!"
3,Things that go bump in the night!,"Practicing storytellers contributed these hair-raising tales, which are divided into the sections, Heart and Horror, Shhh..., Reaching Across, Maximum Nightmare, and Bonestories. Varied and distinct voices tell each creepy tale, and a section at the end provides brief information on the tellers and their tales. There is a story here for every horror fan, but that also means that not every tale will appeal to every reader. Traditional stories such as ""Will the Circle be Unbroken"" are joinced by contemporary urban myths such as ""Room for One More."" Should be useful for more sophisticated scary story readers and adults looking for read-alouds or stories to tell that will provide ""maximum nightmare."" Fun, quick reading.--S. Thorup"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"My scanner never worked. The software cannot find the scanner(or the connection.) I studied all the documentation and downloaded the fix program from hp's website, but it still doesn't work.(It was good that they have a ""fix"" program on their web site to fix this problem, but is it means that they know this product is not perfect?) The so called warrantee for the 3200 model is not protect me at all. No email support. Phone support cost me $2.5/Min by calling a 900 number. To get it repaired, you have to CALL the tech support($2.5/min) to convience them it was the hardware probelm(their problems), not other problems(my problems).... I gave up. and I will never buy any hp product any more."
3,"Very useful, but.....","The scanner was very easy to setup and use, but the colors I got were a bit washed-out and, in some cases, pixelated. The included OCR software was very rudimentary and not very flexible. I purchased a much more robust scanner suite called Pagis Pro 3.0 which made this scanner a bit better [and] more useful."
1,Watch out Windows XP!,Be careful getting this scanner if you have anything over Windows 98. The software is not recognized and it will not work.
2,"Works ok, but not on Win 2000","I used this scanner for awhile on win 98 but after getting frustrated with win 98 unstability, I upgraded to win 2000. The scanner now crashes even with the win 2000 drivers from HP so I am leary of buying anymore HP scanners since they mostly use the same Precision Scan software. Avoid this scanner if you have Win 2000"
4,"Slow, but reliable","This was my first scanner, and in my opinion, a very well designed one. I remember that I was up and scanning the first day I brought it home. It even worked with my old 486 long after I got a faster PC. I'll admit that it isn't fast, but if you are only going to do a little occasional scanning (such as for Ebay) it is just fine. It hums and it grinds- but it never failed me.The only reason that I finally sold mine was, that the cable connectors (parallel port) weren't compatible with my new Gateway (USB)."
3,Hard to Setup,"I thought that this scanner was annoying at first but when I finally got it to work It was very good. The installation instrutions were very good. It came with a schematic drawing and was easy to plug in, but when I tried to install the software my computer would freeze. Finally when I got the scanner setup and scanned something in the quality of the photo was pretty good and I was satisfied with the results."
5,ABOVE AND BEYOND,"This is above and beyond any guide book i have seen. The Michelin Green Guide, Paris, has good introductory essays and synopses of all significant sites, whereas Ayers gives extensive historical, architectural, construction and descriptive detail of every site in every arrondissement as well as 18 Ile de France destinations, not just the 16 pages on Versailles; all presented with a definite, though unobtrusive, aesthetic point of view (or maybe i just happen to agree with him). In addition, there are masterly synthesis essays on urban development, housing, metro/RER, arcades and passages, bridges and street furniture. Not for quick reading or casual tourism, despite its ""intended use in the field ... [or] the armchair,"" this book is suitable for upper division undergrad and graduate courses... or anyone who really loves Paris."
4,PARIS,"Paris is so blessed with wonderful architecture, be it from the time of Louis XIV or Chirac. This guide is very current and well researched and the images really pop. Paris is layed out so well and its buildings take advantage of the sight lines. Paris had been relatively lucky with modern buildings, for the most part they have not infringed on Paris's great historic buildings; thank you La Defense. Thank God, after the hideous intrusion on Montparnasse of that huge modern tower, the city set up stringent rules and created La Defense on the western city limits..ah the French, they are great at the aesthetics. If you have any interest in this singular city, then I highly recommend this wonderful book."
3,nothing special,"This book was passable. Nothing impressive. The plot was hardly in a hurry and the characters were not that memorable. One thing I found amusing was how the Solamnics took their families with them on campaign. What an interesting idea. Apparently it's not hard enough to make a decision in battle, you should add familial problems to make it more difficult. That and every scene with the two married couples ended in them having sex. Rather exhausting for them."
3,"Not Bad, worth the expense","If you have read the first to book, go ahead and buy this one. The story of Pervin is okay. This is not an unique story. it won't leave you astounded at Mr. Green's writing ability, but I don't believe you will feel you have wasted your money either."
3,i didn't live upp to the standards of a dragonlance novel,"In my estimation, the only authors who shoukd write Dragonlance are Hickman and Weis. The book alone was good but was not good enough to carry the Dragonlance legacy"
2,13 Gladiators,Mediocre copy from VHS and mostly mediocre films. Duel of Champions with Alan Ladd is not bad. But Rod Taylor is terribly dubbed in the Colossus film. Good bio of Steve Reeves as bonus.
1,Dennis'Take,"This has to be the worst product on Amazon, Don't even think about buying it. You will be nothing but dissapointed."
4,Fun and memorable,"I read this book about 15 years ago (I think!), and I still remember it quite well. The main character is quite real and likeable, and the reader is drawn in to her life. I was a geeky, odd girl and I related to the way that Katie never fitted in with other kids (although her mum, blind to her problems, insisted that there was nothing unusual about her eyes - they were just grey).I think that I would have been around 9-12 when I read this book, which is probably the age when you would like it most."
4,The Girl With The Silver Eyes,One girl had certain powers. Katie is the main character in The Girl With The Silver Eyes. The book tells you about her powers and how she makes friends. All of her friends have powers too. Katie has silver eyes and all of her friends have different color eyes.I like this book because it is interesting and fun to read.
4,The Girl with the Silver eyes,"The Girl with the Silver Eyes is a murder mystery for kids.Iwould recommend this book to 6th & 7th graders to read. I hope you enjoy this book review on The Girl with the Silver Eyes.Katie is nine and half years old;she has silver eyes,Katie is portrayed as a lonely girl. She also has special powers;where she can move things just by thinking about them.When she was 3, her mother And father got divorced.so, Katie went to live with her grandmother in apartment 2-A for the next 6 years.The plot takes shape when Katie's grandmother dies mysteriosly. Mr. Cooper is the police officier involved with the investigation. He does not believe Katie's story ,as her grandmother was in the habit of spoiling Katie. So this story unfolds with all its twists and turns. A real whodunit."
3,"It was o.k, but it could of had a better ending","I think it was intresting plot and good story. I didn't like the ending, because nothing really hapened at the end it was a boring ending."
3,A good but not great book,The back of the book got me really excited but this thrilling sensation soon wore off. The book is about a girl named Katie who has Telekinetic powers. It is hard for her because no one wants to be her friend because she is very different. Even her mother seems threatened by her. It was interesting in the begining but became boring. I reconmend it to a girl 9-11.
5,A childhood favourite,"I must have read this book a dozen times as a child. I liked it enough that I have held on to it for over 30 years and am now reading it to my own children. I am glad to see that it is still in print, and I can't recommend it enough."
4,"""Silver"" story","Charmed in the beginning I was; I collected ""Silver Eyes"" to pass the time at a book store, whilst awaiting my husband. Some elapsed time later, I bought a copy, stayed with the story, excited about Katie's day out and her adventures.Near the end, and at the very end, the charm faded a little. Nevertheless, do give a read to this piece of work. I possibly would welcome an opportunity to provide voice over of this story in audio version."
3,the girl with the silver eyes,"The Girl with the Silver EyesBy: Willo Davis RobertsThe Girl with the Silver Eyes is about a girl named Katie. She has no friends because of her unusual eyes. She not only has silver eyes, she can also make things float with her mind. But then, she gets accused for doing something she would never even think about doing in her life!I think this book gets 3 stars out of 5 in rating, because of all the suspense and drama that happens throughout the book. An example of suspense and drama in the book is when she was wondering if they would lock her up for her abilities. ""If only I had someone to talk to, someone like my father. I don't think he'd let them lock me up, but I don't know where he is...""By: Malina Alexander"
5,Read this almost twenty years ago and still love it!,"I read this book when I was seven. Now I'm 26 and still love it! I became a bookworm after reading books like this one and now I'm a librarian.I think back on this book fondly from time to time. 'The Girl with the Silver Eyes' has just stayed with me. I started asking about Thalidomide after I read this story.I treasure so many of the books I read in elementary school, among them: Bridge to Tarabithia and Jacob Have I Loved by Katherine Patterson, Anastasia Krupnik by Lois Lowry, Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls, Dicey's Song by Cynthia Voigt,Why are there so many wonderful children books while adult books are dominated by mystery and romance schlock? <<Sigh>>"
3,not in typical lev style,this book is an incomplete book and one of the first writings of author. Hence you will not find the style and depth of subject as you see in Anna Karenina or War And Peace. Still mind set of young tolstoy is appreciable. Also gives you a good idea of Russian landLords lifestyle of late Eighteen century and Early Ninteenth century. Do read if you get a chance
4,Lots of fun and familiar,"It's hard to find good, lively fashion writing that's geared to the consumer -- not just to the elite insiders working in the fashion industry. This book fills a need for the everyday fashionista who loves to read intelligent copy about clothes, especially the classics already in her closet. The author knows her subject and her affection is contagious.There's nothing much new here, but still, it's loads of fun to rehash. Reading these essays, I had a vague sense that I'd read some of the material in several other places by several other authors -- such is the familiarity of the Little Black Dress, for example. (Everyone wants to own the LBD and every fashion writer in America has written about it. Ditto the trench coat.)But don't let that spoil the fun and romance of this delightfully fun read! It's a great little tribute to the classics, and deserves a place on your nightstand."
5,One of the Best,I am a yankee but sure do want to be a southerner after reading this cookbook. The recipes are so easy and not all need exotic ingredients but easy to find items at the local grocery store. The sidebars are very entertaining. I hope to host my first catered party for friends in the spring. This is one cookbook that will be out on the kitchen counter all the time.
3,"A few members of the ""Carry On"" series in a ""Ten Little Indians"" takeoff","I love the ""Carry On"" series and most of the characters, but Sydney James and Kenneth Connor just aren't enough to carry this poorly scripted bxw film without the rest of the crew. Shirley Easton appears in the film, as she did in a ""Carry On"" film before she really hit it big, as does Donald Pleasance, later very big in the ""Halloween"" films. Some of the puns and jokes were fun and the actors tried to make the slow script funny, but I fell asleep twice during my viewing and had to rewind each time. I'd rate it a bit under the best of the early ""Carry On' films."
5,SPECTACULAR!,"This book has great memorable characters that you can identify with as well as think of them as your own friends.A fantastic sequel to the book,Sorceror's Son.Kudos to Phllis Einstein for her effort.A third book would very welcome."
1,Fantastic Book but the CD is a complete waste of Money,"I was so impressed with the fourth Edition of the Valuation text (if you don't own it, buy it now) that I went and ordered the accompanying CD-rom thinking that it would have all the basic financial templates outlined in the book. I specifically wanted a valuation model for Banks.Whilst the model on the CD is fine for valuing non-financial companies, I HAD ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT FROM THE NET FOR FREE. Furthermore the CD didn't include a model for valuing banks - I'm going to have to build a new one from scratch.In other words, I've paid a fortune for something I had already got for free. Ironic then, that the model comes from a leading consulting company (McKinsey)...what's the saying about consultants charging a fortune to tell you things you already know (or in my case sell me things I already OWN)."
3,Light reading,"I purchased this book, in anticipation of completing the series from her last republication of the MacKade brothers: Rafe and Jared.It is the typical Roberts' book with the predictable characters and plot. The ghosts/past reliving moments was overdone. The story of Devin was expected. However both stories were dull, and repetitive in conjunction with Rafe and Jared.I would recommend a different series, Born in Ice, Fire, and Shame, for newcomers. She is a phenomenal author...just have to be careful with the republications."
3,Good beach read,"This two stories are romantic and do hold your interest, but I would caracterize them as ""very light reads"". And since they are very brief stories, the romance unfolds almost too fast. There is not really enough of a build up. Clearly one of Nora Roberts early efforts, but nonetheless, worthwhile."
5,"I Love Nora Roberts,","And I have been a fan for years, and years, and years, and...well, you get the idea. I had a fun time reading this book. I love the characters. This book is a fast and fun read and would add a little zest to a lazy afternoon of reading for anyone that likes this genre!"
4,Good Read,"The last two stories of the Mackade brothers are not as good as the first two, and Devins story is definately better than Shanes, but still enjoyable."
5,great read,"Very much enjoyed the story of these two last brothers. Loved both characters, couldn't wait to read about how things ended up with them."
5,MacKade,"Absolutely fabulous book, the four brothers series was a fast paced modern romance series that I just couldn't put down."
3,Reused book - The MacKade Brothers: Devin and Shane,This is a Nora Roberts book so of course the content was great. The condition of the book wasn't as good as those I've received previously through Amazon...but as I really wanted to finish this series of stories I was willing to deal with it.
4,Finish With a Bang,This is an excellent finish to the MacKade Brothers. I've especially enjoyed the saga with Devin and Cassie both romantic and suspenseful. If you are a big Nora Roberts fan of the MacKade brothers This is an excellent addition to the library.
1,treo silicone cover,"not that high quality, and it was the wrong cover. it was labeled for the treo 650 but it was wrong. it fit the 700 and above. i would not buy from this distributor again."
3,Pink skin for Palm Treo,Good price. The material is a little slippery which keeps it from staying in place. Also the thin cuts seem like they will tear quickly.
2,You get what you paid for,"I bought this skin case for my wife's 700wx. I will not complain about the slow shipping because I was told this when I placed my order. It is less than what I expect. Not fit the 700wx very well, especially the top part. Also, the two keys just below the screen are partially covered by the skin, and hard to use. Last, the phone looks thicker when it is in the case even though my wife want a skin case to make her phone more cute. Anyway, you get what you paid for, and, at least, this case can give some protection to your phone."
4,Silicone your Treo,"this case fit my Treo 700P nicely, i actually got the purple color. my only complaint was that the case was a little too loose fitting, and tended to distort especiall at the bottom, where it would stretch up and cover the bottom row of keys. makes a nice gripping surface on the slick Treo case. in my situation, the silicone case was too gripping, and i made it difficult to remove the phone from my belt holster, so i had to take the case off."
2,Just a VERY basic reference. For novice writers.,"ANY leader who uses this to find ways to describe their sailors has no business writing their evals. These ""phrases"" are tired and unoriginal; they are fluff, unsubstantial, non-quantitative, and demonstrate lack of vocabulary, ability to construct meaningful sentences, and lack of creative writing ability. It's a moderate ""reference"" for certain types of guidelines as far as form, or certain criteria if you are a novice eval/fitrep writer. If you can't spell, don't know the difference between LEAD and LED (as in past tense leadership), and fill your sentences with far too many prepositions, use this to de-junk your writing, to find a concise way to just get to the point. Any board in the Navy will recognize these meaningless ""BLURBS"" and it will diminish the credibility and weight of the block 43 write up. 20+ years of evals/and fitreps and still writing!"
5,Navy Eval and Fitrep Writing Guide.,"I recently made a comment on about not recieving my book, which i must take back because after all the confusion was settled. Ms. Bently resent me my item as i asked for. Ms. Bently has offered me the Best Custumer Service i have ever recieved and i would be greatful to do business with her again. Thank You Ms. Bently."
2,Color me unimpressed.,"While I do think this book is a great deal at around $14, I found the content underwhelming. Imagine if a kind of slimy quasi-celeb in Hollywood had a series of drug/sex parties and someone walked around with a camera taking pics of the the men's equipment and caught a few couples doing sleazy stuff. Then various girls posed and showed their boobs, a few pornstars came by and blew some guys, and the host took more pics of his Johnson. Some of the guests clowned around with props and did silly stuff naked, all captured on film. Then you would have the pics in this book. The only thing I can say for Terry is that he's taken some of the best pics of Lindsay Lohan I've seen. But there is nothing approaching that quality in this book."
4,Sex sells!,"I am a fan of Terry Richardson, his work is very simple when it comes to the world of photography. His work does not have all that high-tech lighting, it is all very natural; like 80's polaroids. Terry shoots things as he sees them and while turning pages in Terryworld, you can visualize what he does daily, the man sure parties hard and has a lot of fun. It's definitely not every day that you see a photographer getting a BJ in his own book.This is a great book if you have a open mind and like au natural and do not take offensive to pornographic imagery. However, if your a prude and do not like sexual content, stay away from this book. This book is NC-17!"
2,Pornographic and not in a good way,"Terry Richardson manages to make the human body as well as sex seem vile and disgusting. His photos have no redeeming qualities other than for shock value but once you get passed being shocked, what do you have left? Not much at all.The only reason you might want to buy and keep this book is for when Richardson dies or goes to jail, which given the way he seems to live will probably be soon. Then you could maybe sell it for a profit. Personally, I'm getting rid of this book because no one who came to my house or studio would be impressed with it, even models. Basically, it's the type of book I wouldn't be caught dead with by anyone I admire."
4,Definitely not one to be on your coffee table,"I bought this book originally thinking I could leave it out for cool ""photography"" browsing. If you'd like to do that - be prepared to purchase alot of stickers :).The photography is very im gonna show you a penis right now - in your face - type photography. There is some weird enough photos that a girl looking through this might want some serious explanations. I've gone in a search for removable stickers for the adventurous type. I'll try covering up the plethora of craziness to make it more ""easily accessable"". Overall as a capture of Terry's work. This is great - and really shows you the ""raw"" energy he puts into getting the shot."
1,Don't waste your money on this bok!,"This book is a waste of money and not worth the price, even though it is not that expensive. It's just a bunch of ugly, grotesque people that this guy photographed. Weird is a polite adjective to use.leo44"
3,poor quality,"Print quality is poor. Many, if not most of the images have lines running through them--like the corrugated lines on cardboard. I've received two different copies of this book from Amazon. Both have the same print quality issue. Oh well, for $14 . . ."
5,Love,"If you're looking to buy a Terry Richardson book then you already know what you're getting yourself into - and you won't be disappointed. For everyone else, I recommend doing your research on Terry before buying this book so you can really decide if it's for you. It's vulgar, vivid, perverse, intense, creative, playful, dirty, disgusting, degrading, and everything else beautiful in this world. I highly recommend this, especially for the price."
3,It Really is Used!,"I normally buy used textbooks and they rarely have pen/highlighter/pencil marks in them so I thought buying used here would not be much different. I wanted to save a couple bucks on textbooks so I bought this one used. It is VERY VERY VERY used. There are pencil marks all over, notes taken on every couple of pages, and basically a lot of erasing I need to do. I wish I would've spent the couple more dollars to get a new version, but just remember when deciding new vs. used that the used version is not going to be as clean as you thought it would be."
4,Bring it on..,"Raw, gritty, down-and-dirty blues. That little ol' band from Texas remains firmly grounded in their grungy blues style while still trying out a couple new tricks: some electronic effects, some injected funk, reworkings of ""Pincushion"" and Elvis's ""Teddy Bear."" Who else would bring out Jeff Beck just to sing? I guess Billy's fuzzy guitar must have been in the wash or something.It's not the 70s, and they're not redoing Tejas; it's not the 80s, and they're not redoing Eliminator. But XXX finds Billy, Dusty and Frank riding things out in grand style - which is to say, slithering through a batch of nasty tunes in a low-down haze of whiskey and smoke. This speaks everyone's language, fun in the car and familiar as a favorite brew. What else did you expect?"
1,Worst Studio Album,"I bought this album when it came out and was incredibly dissapointed. Again, you have to write a set of songs to go along with that great fuzz toned guitar. Plodding, boring and lazy are a few of the words that come to mind when I think of this album. I was a huge fan of Rhythmeen, which seemed like a re-birth of the old Top sound to me. This was a huge step in the wrong direction. So, in my humble opinion if you want a good later day ZZ Top album pick up Rhythmeen or even Mescalaro."
4,ZZ boogie!,"I bought this CD just a couple days before the ZZ TOP with the Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. I was really hoping what I was going to listen to, but the album was almost as same as Rithmean which was the second latest album. I don't mean I was disappointed at this album, but it's much less than I expected. If you are true ZZ TOP fans, you can't miss it. This album is hard bluesy boogie that ZZ TOP stick to since they've started playin!! By the way, ZZ TOP did not play almost any new songs in their concert! They played from the album ""Rithmean"", ""Iluminater"",..... The concert itself was fantastic though."
4,Hard rocking blues,"This is more of the hard-rocking style of blues/rock that the ""Little ole band from Texas"" has been giving us for the past few years, in the style of Antenna. The ""Sinpusher"" track is a reworking of ""Pincushion"" from the Antenna release and the cover of the Elvis Presley ""Teddy Bear"" is not quite like the King's sound, thankfully. The harsh guitar licks are not like the ZZ Top of old, and take some getting used to if you are a fan of the old Tejas to Recycler sound, but it is worth the adjustment. This is a must for the true ZZ Top fan."
2,Matt from PA,"Well, I've listend to every ZZ Top song in the past 20 or so years. After listening to XXX, I'm no longer sure what to expect from the three texan's. Sure, XXX has some ZZ highlights, but most of the release is just hash. The best song on the CD is Hey, Mr. Millionare - which should have been done in the studio and released as a single.If ZZ Top doesn't come up with a sound that is fresh (like they did when they broke the charts in the 80's), they will be selling less and less CD's.My advise - only buy if you are a true ZZ Top fan."
4,Great job guys,"This is a worthy CD from the 3-bearded guys from Texas. I have followed the guys for the last 18 years and XXX is worth every cent. I don't say it is 100% perfect, but it is close to be."
3,"It'll do until ""Tres Hombres (parte dos)"" comes out","Yeah, it's still not as good as Rio Grande Mud or Tres Hombres, or Fandango....but Reverend Billy does manage to get the nastiest guitar tone this side of Rhythmeen. And there are some very very good live cuts on this disc.Truth be told, there's some pretty good playing on this album, like maybe the boys have been wood shedding a bit. For a while back in the 80s I was sure Billy Gibbons had lost his touch. He hasn't. And drummer Frank Beard is as great as ever.I just got this today, so I can't make a definite yea or nay quite yet, which is why I gave it a three. But I will say that it felt mighty good to drive back to work with the top down, new ZZ Top blasting from the car stereo. Give it a shot."
1,there worst,"I can`t believe that people are giving this piece of ... a 5 star. ... What a joke.Not only is this the worst cd zz top ever put out,but it was one of the worst cd`s to come out that year,,and that is saying alot.When you put a 5 star next to this,it gives you no credibility.Please zz top fans,stay away from this cd and get tres hombres or eliminator."
2,Where are the songs ?,"Tone, schmone, what's tone without a song ? Weak songs and melodies, Mescalero and Rhythmeen are MUCH better for this top era"
5,"The older they get, the better they get!","I've been a fan since Tres Hombres, and have enjoyed every incarnation! This album is a mixture of that Texas Bluezz, with a 90's flavor. My favorite song is Trippin. You have to buy this one!"
4,Potent XXX,"The album title refers not to raunchy erotica nor to hard drink; it refers to ZZ Top's 30 year history. But this offering from that little ol' band from Texas is as potent as secret hooch or libidinous encounters. The guitars and groove are saturated in fuzz, gritty, greasy, and irresistible. Gibbons, Hill, and Beard incorporate some beats and sounds that would otherwise be hip-hop and turn them into, well, ZZ Top (on ""Crucifixx-A-Flatt"" and ""Beatbox""). Tracks ""36-22-36,"" ""Poke Chop Sandwich,"" and ""Fearless Boogie"" are timeless Top. The last four tracks are live, including a blues version of Elvis Presley's ""Teddy Bear"" and Jeff Beck guest vocalizing on ""Hey Mr. Millionaire."" I've found this album only gets better the more you cruise with it, and it stays in my car CD a lot."
4,Boy was I wrong!,"Back in early October, I gave a less than complimentary review of ""XXX."" But boy-howdy was I ever wrong! I had only listened to ""XXX"" a couple of times before writing the review, and since then, I've hardly taken it out of my CD player! It really grows on you and in my opinion, it's much better than the last effort ""Rythmean."" The only thing that bothers me is that ""Poke Chop Sandwich"" or ""Trippin"" aren't getting any radio play, two of the better tracks on the CD. Anyway, overall, it's an excellent effort, and I give it a ""thumbs up"" 3 Stars. Buy it...you'll be glad you did!"
5,Mr. Boxing has the knockout punch,"If you want the old golden era of Hollywood in a book then look no further. Shadow Boxer is a wonderfully plotted, atmospheric book of the forties. The mood and style is captured vividly in the lead protaganist, Billy Nichols. Billy is the boxing columnist for the San Francisco Inquirer and he gets deeply embedded in mayhem, murder and femme fatales.In his Through the Ropes Column Billy writes:Life is fixed. That's why I offer simple advice to any amateur turning pro; Kid don't leave it up to the judges. Get yourself a knockout punch.Shadow Boxer has a punch that takes your breath away. This is one entertaining read. Don't miss out."
4,Lawrence Welk,I just thought it would be more like their weekly program. But still good for the I sit with.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,We purchased this for a gift for my mom who loves Lawrence Welk--it was very disappointing--we ended up returning it. It was definitely not worth $45.00! Luckily Amazon was very good about it.
1,VHS Lawrence Welk,"This VHS arrived damaged, it was unplayable. It was not properly packaged for shipping. There was no bubble wrap or protection of the VHS. Extra costs were incurred to return the damaged product. Service was not prompt for the refund. I had to cancell the payment through the credit card."
5,Music to live by,I am a caregiver for a 97 year old Lawrence Welk fan. I purchased this video to brighten up our days. It has done so much more. The quality of the music is wonderful. We are lifted and inspired with it's love.
3,"Nice idea, but not long enough",The idea of this is great! I just wish it was a little bit longer. It's not big enough to hold a full size letter (#10 I think). Only the small ones.
4,Good Seller,Good Seller would do business with again. The door hides the keys from view and curious kids.
4,Good Introduction,"Being an architect already, I found that the book was an excellent introduction, even for me, to the various alternative building techniques emerging. It gave the author's honest opinion about many of the techniques, which was very appreciated. Don't expect it to be a precise how-to guide for any of the methods. It is an excellent overview, though, that can help you evaluate which building techniques you would like to explore further. The references at the end are vast and helpful.However, I found that for a book about the ""Natural House"", it often suggested many un-green building materials (OSB, polypropylene bags). Sometimes their ""ungreeness"" was mentioned, sometimes not."
2,Meant for new or occasional trainers only,"I was a little disappointed with this book. While it contains a few helpful reminders of what you should and shouldn't do, anyone who is a professional trainer (or a business professional with public speaking experience in general) won't find much new here.I can't say there isn't anything of value, becuase it does contain some good pointers on improving your visual aids, how not to overdo class interaction, etc.A good ""reminder"" checklist for folks just getting into public speaking & training."
3,Book is misnamed,"The book is misnamed. It is titled the story of Schwinn, a family saga, but this is less a business book and more a history of biking in America. People who love to read the great American business stories are better served by reading the authors' original article in Crain's Chicago Business: not much more is added on the subject; the later generation Schwinn family are slammed for running the company into the ground, so they didn't cooperate or give interviews, so the story is rather impersonal, gleaned from available public records.Bicycle enthusiasts would love this book: it tells the story of the invention of the mountain bike; it relates how names like Giant, Trek, Schimano were born. It also tells the story about the death of Schwinn, but the story as told is less the death of Schwinn and more the birth of California companies and foreign competition."
4,FABULOUS BIOGRAPHY!,"This book really gives you an insight into both the late Ari Onassis and the lateMaria Callas with an in between look at Jackie Kennedy Onassis. It was not an easyread, but it was interesting and I knew alot more about these three fascinating peoplethan I did before I read it..."
3,good gossip on remarkable lovers,"This is a great vacation book, well researched and by a very good reporter. The trouble is, should we care about the melodramas therein? I would arge yes, as they were outsized personalities and changed their times as much as reflected them.The reader will be treated to a real view of the glitterati, from Callas and Onaissis, to Jackie Kennedy as she used the designer dresses he would buy to ""launder"" money by reselling them. It is sleaze at its best and a first-rate reporter to look under all the rocks for the voyeur, that is, me and you.Recommended."
1,Disappointment,"Greek Fire turned out to be a real disappointment to me: one of the worst books I have ever read in my entire life... The whole book is made of assumptions, rumors which are not scientifically based on any true documents nor sources. But more irritating, unfortunately Nicholas Gage can not help himself showing his ""racist"" inclinations... His apparent hatred for Turkey is visible almost in every single page of the book.... Why in the hell, does he talk about the siege of a town by the Turks in th 16th century?.... How can a writer who does not even know the major developments in the history of the world, write a biography?..... By the way, for all the readers, the massacre in 1922 that Nicholas Gage talks about for the lenght of the whole book: Greeks had invaded Turkey and declared war and Turkey had to protect their unity: it is not massacre Mr. Gage: it's a war of independence.... anyhow.... an awful reading experience it has been to me"
4,This book is GREAT!,I liked this book because I could read it myself and the story was great. It was a very good story. READ IT SOON! -- Eric 1st grade
2,I didn't care for the views this movie portraited.,"I know its hard to know until you are in that position, but giving up on a child because its hard or the child could be disabled or because of expense, seems like a horrible thing to me. Disabled kids/adults are some of the happiest people alive, its only 'normal' adults that have a problem with it, and that is sad."
5,Heatwarming Movie!!,This is a heatwarming movie starring John Lithgow about a couple having a premature baby.Watch the movie for the outcome.It's a must see!!
4,"This is crazy, never would have imagined","I never thought a string quartet could do Disturbed but they can. It is something you have to listen to for a little bit, let it sink in, that this is different and lacking David's voice but its pretty good."
1,deception,"First off, even if you could roll the hose perfectly tight like the picture, the handle sits just above the drum radius, you might get another 50 ft of hose but I wouldn't count on it. Of course, it's made in china, so are the directions, you need pay attn to pix, it comes with hose randomly wadded around reel, and the fittings, I cannot fathom why they put them in and not tighten them, check, doubecheck and recheck everything. If they sold it for $40, maybe, otherwise, look at another product."
3,Difficult to Install,"This was a good value, but be ready for some difficulty. The unit is not engineered really well. Poor clearances for assembling the mounting bracket. The bolts don't have good clearances to keep a wrench the the back side to keep from spinning. Customers that purchase probably have good mechanical abilities as they have a substantial compressor. The big plus is that it does not leak air from the slip joint and that is what counts. I would still buy it again."
2,"The hose was good, but reel needs work",The reel did not work well unless firmly mounted to a wall and even then the hose was difficult to get tightly wound. I finally just took the hose off and rebuilt the reel so it would work adequately.
1,What you send is a cheeper model than you advertise,"Reel in box was cheeper model without manual, not auto, hose layering. Right box, but wrong item in the box. Your return policy won't let me exchange it for the right item, even though it's your mistake. I have to pay for reshipping (and don't have a clue if I'll get it back) then wait for you to credit my account."
4,Fits ThinkPad X61S; Lenovo OEM,"My Lenovo X61S is going on 4 years old, this is my third battery of this style. Keeping it on AC adapter most of the time seems to wreck havoc with the battery life which is how I went through the 1st one quickly. I now try to use an older 4 cell battery just for AC adapter use as brief power out protection. I save this battery for road use. My last one lasted 2 years.This one is priced right and fits with no issues. It is marked as a Lenovo OEM battery. For half the price of the Lenovo web site I'm happy!"
2,Seems to be original but last no more than 6 months,"I bought this battery in 2011 (January), but after six months of use it does not last more than 3 hours."
2,Not recommended,"The product pictured shows a Lenovo X60/X60s extended battery, while the product being sold by BrtilliantStore is a generic non-branded battery.Original Lenovo X60/X60s extended battery has a capacity of 5200 mAh, this battery is only 4400 mAh.This battery doesn't fit well into the laptop, one of the locking mechanisms doesn't easily latch so the battery may accidentally fall-out during use. Additionally, it sticks out further than Lenovo extended battery making the use of the docking station difficult."
4,I can't believe that they are charging so much for this video!!,"I just can't believe that this particular video could be sold for such a rip off price!!Ok, so it's out of print...BIG DEAL!! ebay sell them all the time so don't waste your money here!. I bought this exact copy a while ago and payed about $20 for it.....love 'Ship Of Spies' episode....nice wedding kiss ;-)You can get most of these videos for much cheaper elsewhere....BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,The Nothing Book,"Impossible to read the type face, poorly written, badly edited. The author obliviously has nothing to say. If this book can be published, there's hope for all of us."
3,Not so good....,"This was a difficult book to read because I didn't find the main characters to be very likeable. Although I strongly related to Abigail's desire to run away from it all and start over again, I found her to be way too selfish, standoffish and manipulative. And Kris....yuck! Way too sexually preoccupied. The only one I sort-of connected with is Maddie.Instead of the sisterhood bonding and nurturing of long-lasting friendships that hallmark most women's fiction, these characters were really just a trio of users who only reached out to each other for what the other could do for them. I definitely had a hard time understanding them or feeling anything for them or with them.The reason I didn't give the book an even lower rating is that the latter quarter or so ties up the loose ends nicely and redeemed the story somewhat, so that I didn't feel I totally wasted my time reading it.Still, there are MUCH better stories of sisterhood out there...."
3,VCR tape of Grandpa Jones,"The VCR tape of Grandpa Jones was well used and overpriced. The only reason I bought it and kept it was because I wanted it for my 88 year old father. He asked how much it cost, but I was ashamed to tell him how much I overpaid for it. I'm sure he thought it was $5 rather than $35."
3,"Churchy, but good harmonies...","This is one of those albums that would make a good segment of the population thrill with delight. The Ned Flanders of the world. With its Biblical quote references and otherwise inspirational talk, it has a levitational quality. For the Homer Simpsons of the world, weighed down by their own (gleeful) ignorance, this will come across as another album for ""Charlie Church"". Ron Block has shown brilliance in his work with Alison Krauss. His songs show that even flawed people can ""make it"". Here his songs come across as ""I know where I am...where are you?"" And that is not a comfortable feeling for someone who considers himself a fan of his music. That said, the music itself, the harmonies, the playing, the reverence...all impeccable. This is a good album, it just is better for some than others."
2,Not The Same; Not As Good,"I was a Forbes Family fan back in the 80s. I saw them perform at a small country church on a Sunday evening in the fall. Lori was very pregnant and played an electric bass. Jay did his best on the mandolin. Lisa's voice was just as pure and beautiful as on any of their recordings, and their harmonies were superb. It was an evening I'll never forget.""In The Shadow of Your Wings"" tries to recreate that 15 years later. It doesn't cut it. Thirty-something Lisa tries to sing like a teenager. Her voice has matured, and she just can't do it. ""I Need Thee Every Hour"", the best selection, was cut short after only two verses.The Forbes Family has recorded some of the best gospel music (in my opinion), but this isn't it. I strongly encourage anyone to get some of their older recordings from the 80s. Pass on this."
1,I already know how to clean!,"This author spent too much telling the reader how to do laundry, dishes, dust, clean, etc. Her characters had no depth, why did we need to know about her tenant and his ex-wife, neither played any part in the subject of this story. In fact the tenant and his ex-wife could have been left out entirely, it had no bearing on anything. Also too much time having to read about the parakeet, again it had nothing to do with anything. Don't bring characters into a story that have no depth. This is my first Charlotte LaRue Mystery, and it will be my last."
4,Good Quality,I have used 10 of these so far and only 1 of them got corrupted. So I think it was a fair deal
2,spotty quality,I have had mixed results with these DVDs burning slideshows out of iDVD. Some come out fine but larger ones burn okay but do not play well on some DVD players and computers. Burning the same content on other media cleared up the problems. So I have to think the problems were with these DVDs.
5,Good DVD-R 8x media.,"I have burned about 10 of these backing up files using Lite-On LightScribe 24X SATA DVD+/-RW Dual Layer Drive IHAS424-98 - Retail (Black) which I also bought on Amazon, and so far every burn has been smooth and successful.It is very easy to label because there are no brands or anything on it, but sometimes hard to pick which side to label since they are so nearly alike.I am using K3b 2.0.0 on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) and here is what is reported for a blank disc.Type: DVD-R SequentialMedia ID: MCC 02RG20Capacity: 510:38:38 min (4.4 GiB)Rewritable: noAppendable: noEmpty: yesLayers: 1Sessions: 0Supported writing speeds: 6.0x (8310 KB/s)8.0x (11080 KB/s)16x would be faster, but this is pretty good and seems reliable.Would consider purchasing again."
5,First Verbatim purchase since discovering Taiyo Yuden dvds.,"These DVDs are extremely reliable and cheap compared to the Taiyo Yuden Discs I usually buy. I buy these for backing up important media and documents and I haven't had a failure yet. I'm not sure about the longevity of the discs, and I automatically equate discs being made in Taiwan with being bad, but these DVDs seem to be proving otherwise. I think the price is quite a value.. and will continue to buy these for the foreseeable future."
3,dvd-r spindle 50 disc,"the product came very quickly which is a goog sign. they were in rapped spindle no damage to dvd's. they just didnt work for the product i bought them for. they were advertised as,(Verbatim Shiny Silver DataLife Plus 8x DVD-R Spindle, 50)and i recieved 16x dvd-r. my symphonic -rw\-r dvd recorder for my television is very specific in what it will use ive been having problems getting the right ones to use for my recorder so when i seen the product as advertised with the verbatim name at 8 x's i bought them. other than recieving something i didnt order the disk are working fine in another recorder i have on my computer."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews for these here they seemed like a good buy. People said they were reliable, and that's what I was looking for. Unfortunately, however, they have proven less than reliable. I have burned many dvds on my Mac using 3 different programs for 3 different purposes: data, DVD copying, and DVD making (home videos), and they fail about half the time. No joke. I thought I must be doing something wrong, but I can't figure it out if I am. All the settings are correct, and the computer is practically brand new. I burn cds in the same drive as well and have never had one fail. So, I can only conclude that there is something wrong with the disks. Maybe I just got a faulty batch, but needless to say, I will not be buying these again."
4,Just blank dvds.,Good stuff...does what it's supposed to do...Only bad thing is that the surface is not printable...but sharpies work.
3,one of My boys bought Me this and.........,"These DVD R's are ok but not great. alot of them are ending up as cup coasters because of ""disk errors"" I think if this is going to happen I'll buy the even cheaper back of 100 by another company atleast then I dont feel so ripped off."
5,This is a superb album,"I love this CD. With Richard's fiddle flying and Tony Trischka's high steppin', fast paced banjo pickin' it just doesn't get any better. There is a definite Bill Monroe influence on some of the vocal tracks like ""Along About Daybreak"" But when they get wound up their playing is infinite! A perfect mix of the two. There are no bad cuts on this cd; but check out tracks 7, 9 and 12. This 1998 Grammy Nominated CD is a perfect addition to any Bluegrass collection. You won't be sorry you did."
3,Not as nice as the previous calendars,"The pictures are too small, the monthly calendar is too small and the words in boxes too big are a distraction. I hope for a better effort next year."
1,Waste of money!!!,"This workbook is useless without the companion Byrne and Churchill's Comprehensive French Grammar. On the back of the book it states that the book it could be used as a ""companion"" to the afore named book, or independently, and that ""every grammatical point (is) illustrated and explored"". Don't fall for it. This book does neither and is incomprehensible without the companion.Unless your using this for a particular class, don't buy it. I'd say that there are so better books out there."
5,"My ""Bible""",Every morning before I go to work I read one of the 32 Ground Rules in the book. They are so short that it only take a couple of minutes to go through it. But there are so much of worth considering so you are strengthen for hole day long.
5,Unbiased view of The Great War of the South,This is not a book for people who can't handle truth or those who refuse to accept it. The thinking person will greatly enjoy it.
3,Long on Opinion Short on Fact,"For Adams to be a leader in taxation he falls short with the proof that the Civil War was a war on tarrifs. In fact, Adams skip little facts like the fact that the present day tariff was the lowest tariff since 1830 and that most Southerners had voted for that tariff. Adams also heavily weighs what he puts in about Lincoln and his willingness to free slaves. Slaves were in no danger according to Adams. Even though the Southerners thought so, but they were just loudmouthed louts who shot themselves in foot when they lied that the war was over slavery and caused the Europeans to back away from helping them. All I can say is if this is the ""real"" reason for the war - I got a nice bridge to sell you in New York."
5,A New And Revealing Look At A Terrible War,"Adams, like the majority of Americans, was raised on the Worship Lincoln, Free The Slaves emotional history created by the Civil War's victors. Me too. As I studied and became more critical, I realized there were important Civil War facts not being taught in my California schools and colleges. Adams nails it, and very objectively. He is not a Lincoln hater, but read about how Lincoln signed a warrant for the arrest of the Chief Justice of The U.S. Supreme Court. Or read Adam's logical analysis of the Gettysburg Address. A rare book. A must for those who would understand the history of our country."
2,This is how an attorney writes history,"Charles Adams, a tax attorney, provides a strong argument that the civil war was fought over (surprise) taxes! Like any good lawyer, he sifts through mountains of information to find those few shards that back up his case only. He utterly ignores the far more numerous editorials and speeches by major figures (including Jefferson Davis, Alexander Stephens and Abraham Lincoln) that completely contradict his claim and accepts as ""objective"" observations by French and British figures who obviously had an interest in Southern victory. In truth, which Adams had to see in his painstaking research, the vast majority of arguments, commentary and political wranglings leading up to secession revolved around slavery and slavery only. This book will sit very well with those too ignorant to know better and the southern ancestor worshippers who will believe anything so long as it is complimentary of the great lost cause. Regrettably, that's quite a few folks."
5,Vive les iconoclastes!,"Adams is strictly 'gloves off' as he buries the old guard historians and tears down the idols of Lincoln mythology. Finally, our generation gets a real look at Lincoln and his cohorts--not the apotheoses of your public school textbooks (i.e. propaganda) but the actual despotic, constitution-despising barbarians that exterminated our Republic, callously shedding the blood of more than 620 thousand of its sons for filthy lucre and the establishment of an ""American"" empire.What ails us? Read this book and find out. Better yet, read this book and give it to your children to read!"
4,Works Well for Bichons,"I can't comment too much about the taste of these as unlike the other reviewer I didn't get trashed and sample some, but my puppy seems to like these fine. I've fed her 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup 3 times a day since we brought her home at 9 weeks and she's gained the appropriate amount of weight right on target. She doesn't always finish every meal, but I think this is pretty typical for a puppy."
5,Great Dog Food,Love this and so does my dog. Royal Canin is so pure and good that one does not have to transition it into your dog's diet like most other foods. -even for dogs with finicky tummies. I recommend it highly
3,"'Masters Of Rock, Volume 1' (Dressed To Kill) Various Artists","Not bad for a various artists CD, with several rare (sometimes, hard-to-find ) songs. Like Atomic Rooster's ""Ear To The Snow"", Hawkwind's ""Levitation"", the Saxon classic ""747 (Strangers In The Night)"", the Judas Priest gem ""The Ripper"" and Uriah Heep's ""Too Scared To Run"". Sound quality here is fine, but you might want to try to keep in mind that on many Dressed To Kill label releases, the quality is crap. Plus, the asking price on this disc is good."
2,Get a new editor!,"Although the book does contain good information, it is presented in an extremely repetitive manner. Things are restated two or even three times over. Also, this is the most poorly edited book I have ever read. I find it rather pathetic that a college textbook should have such an abundance of spelling and grammar errors that should have been caught before putting this book into production."
3,Needs serious editing,"This book is informative and fairly easy to read, but it's full of grammar and syntax mistakes."
3,health psychology textbook,"typical textbook. the section on animal experimentation and the issues surrounding it is limited, at best. the section is brief and inaccurate, claiming that the protections provided animals used in experiments ensure humane treatment and are sufficient to prevent suffering. flatly wrong and totally biased. the book was likely financed by some laboratory or other entity that uses animals in barbaric experiments. brief, incorrect, and extremely biased. tells you how to think. like i said: typical textbook."
3,Too many hooks!,"The swinging hooks seemed like a good idea but we find they just get in the way and hanging THREE items especially is troublesome and we often come back to find clothing on the floor that was once hung up. The concept is nice and the price is great for such hardware but don't expect a lot out of the ""triple pronged hooks."""
2,"Be careful, this thing is big",This thing is bigger than I thought it would be. Shame on me for not reading the specs closely enough I guess but in some of the reviews people mentioned putting this in their bathroom. I have a relatively small bathroom so this thing protrudes a good amount. It also does swivel very smoothly but maybe that will come with time.
4,Arensky has some really attrative music...,The piano suites by Arensky are really beautiful and make you wanna listen to them over and over again.
4,good base book for beginners or advanced stencilers,"This book nicely covers the basics such as materials and techniques, with good full color photos to further illustrate what is explained. For the advanced painter, there are some good ideas, again with full color pictures. I've even brought this book with me to a client to show them some samples of what can be done."
1,Very dated,"I found this to be very dated in techniques and style. I knew it was ten years old, but I didn't realize the vast changes in stenciling. I didn't find the instruction to be particularly detailed, and learned far more from the many other books available."
4,Authentic Guide with a few unique tips...,"Well written guide to skiing in the US which still has some utility even though some of the material is outdated. Good descriptions of major ski areas and their personalities. The use of computers was just in it's beginning stages. You can cross reference the material now on the internet. Nice photos too! The only two things that let you know that there is a Playboy connection here is the suggestion that some folks may have used their time in the closed cable cars to have sex, and one photo of a beautiful woman skiing in a bathing suit."
5,Smart and believable,"Christine Bennett is in the process of readjusting to ""normal life"" after spending 15 years as a cloistered nun. At a town meeting, she speaks in defense of disabled twin brothers accused of killing their mother 40 years before and to her surprise is put in charge of researching the case. As she starts to dig into the past, she meets a helpful (and smitten) police officer who helps in her search for the truth.Christina does not run around accusing people of the murder without evidence, judge suspects harshly for their past actions or deliberately place herself in danger which is a refreshing change. This is a refreshing cozy mystery with likeable characters and an engrossing mystery."
5,One of the funniest books I have ever read!,"This book is so funny. The Youngun children are so funny in the things they do and try. From their dog ""Dangit"" to the mule ""Crab Apple"". Antics that all kids try to get away with. Also how Laura's temper gets the best of her. I laughed so hard, reading this book."
5,a must read for nursing mothers (first time or not),"This book is a life saver. I had every imaginable problem trying to get my first child to nurse, and this book addressed every question I had. I referred to it again as I became a parent again. It's loaded with information, and it gave me the confidence to succeed at breastfeeding."
2,Not useful if you have the 2 better ones,"Firstly, I have a lot of respect for Mamis, so this is NOT to run him or his writing style down.In-fact, I have given his other books, When to Buy and How to Sell the Five Star ratings as they are very useful and well written.However, after reading those, this book seems to repeat some of the points made in them and seems a little defensive about Technical Analysis. Avoid this one but positively buy the other two."
1,when technician turns psychologist,"I read Mamis' ""When to Sell"" and looked forward to this book. I was disappointed to find ""The Nature of Risk"" is three parts psycho-babble and one part technical analysis. The psycho-babble is Mamis' philosophy, but is almost incomprehensible. And the TA is nothing that wasn't covered in his earlier book. Buy ""When to Sell"" if you want a book about the stock market. Buy this book if you've got nothing better to do with your $$."
2,So-So,"If you are going to buy one of his books, get ""When to Sell"". This one was long, wordy, and tough to read the whole thing - looking for content. Lots of fluff. Could have used a good editor."
4,"Great for the memories, but....","This is not a criticism of the original Dragon Warrior 1 and 2 games, to which I would give 5-stars across the board. However, the ""improved"" graphics, in my opinion, only made the game more cartoon-y. Sure, the original games did not have the best graphics, but I doubt anyone played them simply for the graphics.I would by this Gameboy Color game(s) again, but it does ultimately fail to recapture the original experience."
4,Opened my eyes,"I hadn't had much interest in reading environmental or historical books. This changed that. Now, my interest and awareness in conservation, LIS, the fishing industry(recreational and commercial), has grown considerably. To much detail to describe here. Read for yourself.I'm currently reading ""Angling in the Smile of the Great Spirit"", which is similar in some ways to this book, but discusses Lake Winnipesaukee. Also very good."
4,Buyer beware; not the complete show,Although this was an excellent concert you should be aware that one segment from the DVD (a very good segment) is missing. Carole does an oldies medley that is just great. I would have given this 5 stars had it been included. The performance was excellent.
3,"Great music, not my preferred format","I bought this CD instead of other Carole King CD's because it contained the largest collection of the songs I wanted to hear. But I was disappointed because of the live sound. Not that the music isn't great. I realized after-the-fact that I prefer the studio recorded, fully-instrumented version over the live style."
1,It makes the study of Circuits very difficult to learn,"Although this book does introduce certain basic topics in Circuits, in my opinion the examples are very easy to perform and the chapter problems introduce questions that cannot be solved by simply reading the text. The solutions guide is non-existant and there aren't any solutions in the back of the book, so a non highly motivated student will have an extreamly difficult time solving these problems on his own. Unless he gets help from an instructor, tutor, etc., he will not know if he is solving the problem correctly. In my opinion this book leaves a lot of holes in the learning process needed for linear circuit analysis and should not be used on its own."
1,Disapointed.....,"The text does a poor job of explaining concepts and is of little help in doing most of the homework problems. Expect to put a great deal of work into understanding chapters that are largely an uncoordinated jumble of defintions, equations, and examples. The book multiplies the difficulty of learning circuit concepts."
1,when teachers become authors....,"i used this book in my linear circuit analysis class at purdue, and it has been anything but a pleasurable experience. the text is somewhat confusing, providing little relevant information or examples which would allow anyone to complete the problems at the end of each chapter. the example problems in the book are too simple, and most people will be surprised at the complexity of some of the homework problems. answers are provided for only a select few of the homework problems, most being only partial answers at that. as a result, it is very difficult to apply anything you've learned from the chapter, or even to know if you're applying anything correctly. i would not suggest this book to anyone trying to learn the subject, it would probably only discourage you. my advice: get another book, or a tutor."
1,Difficult to understand,"This book is less than spectacular in explaining linear circuits. The examples bear almost no resemblence to the homework problems prospective ME students (yes MECHANICAL engineering, not electrical) are forced to do. For instance, no Thevenin equivalence problems in the text refer to op-amp circuits with multiple dependent and independent sources. Attempting to figure out these concepts on one's own leads to frustration. Please talk to R.C. Hibbeler about writing textbooks, and get back to teaching 208 to those helpless EEs."
2,Terrible way to learn electronic network analysis,I have purchased two different books for Electronic Network Analysis - this book and the one by Nielson (9th edition). It is fiar to say that this book is just an awful way to learn circuits and I wish I could burn this book. I would suggest any other book for circuits other than this book.
1,NOT A STUDENT FRIENDLY BOOK,"If an ""old monkey"" finds this book as a good reference. Students don't think so, as a student in purdue this book was a required, however, professors who taught this subject made their best to extract the material and present it in a much more digestible manner. Look for another book (Alexander's book) or any other book is better then this."
1,Inadequate,"I have taken two semesters of classes using this text, and I have to say that the book is largely non conducive to learning circuits. The chapters in the book seem to have no grand direction that ties all the specific details together. Also, the examples are not helpful in understanding the concepts of circuit analysis or in completing the homework problems at the end of the chapters. I would recommend working with the Schaum's guide to Electric Circuits, it is much more concise and effective in its teaching."
5,"Great sling, UGLY, but Wonderful.","I've had this sling for over a year, had it in the field many times and it is comfortable and best of all it doesn't let my rifle slide off my shoulder. Also, it does a very good job of distributing the weight of my rifle (Kimber 300WSM classic select with Ziess 4.5 - 14 scope all of which weighs about 7lbs). My friends have purchased at least two of these just from seeing mine."
1,Sever Me Now,"Is it over? Sever me, please! Amateur and slower than glacier creep. We can't just watch a female victim of rape fall into a morose morass. We have to watch the act itself, committed over what seems an eternity. Then the film gets worse."
3,How much does it weigh ?,"""Weighs only 5 ounces""...but yet the shipping weight is listed as 31 pounds.Huh ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?I haven't bought it, but that doesn't make any sense."
1,NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES!,"GIVE ME A BREAK. RELEASE IT WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. THEN, IT COULD GET 4 OR 5 STARS."
2,"Good group, disappointing collection","I'm sorry I cannot endorse the enthusiatic reviews below.I bought this CD based on the Baltimore Consort's fine, fun collection of Renaissance French tunes (La Rocque 'n' Roll"") and my own love of traditional Irish music. Perhaps I have been spoiled by too many Chieftains CDs, but I found only one tune here memorable, or even interesting: Custer LaRue's rendition of ""Catty (sic) Magee"" in Gaelic.If you like the Baltimore Consort (and Custer LaRue), get another CD of theirs. If you like traditional Irish music, try another group."
4,nostalgia,It was lovely to see again. I saw it when it originally came out. It reminds me of weddings I went to decades ago. I also love the music.I was a lovely gift from my daughter and her family.Don Goldman
3,THE OTHER ANTOINE DOINEL,"1969. Written and directed by Claude Berri. This is the second movie, afterThe Two of Us (Criterion Collection), of the saga of Claude, the other Antoine Doinel of the French cinema. Claude is 30 years old now and is about to get married with the daughter of a wealthy diamond merchant. The high-point of the film is Claude's marriage; 10 years before Robert Altman'sA Wedding, Claude Berri films the behaviour of the guests with a subtle camera. You can now find this film at Amazon.fr on a zone 2 DVD. Enjoyable."
3,not your typical Chickensoup,"My husbnad and I were quite disappointed in this selection of chickensoup stories.They were good stories but not even close to your typical tear-jerking, heartwarming chickensoup stories.Expect some neat stories from one of the greatest places on this planet but you won't need the Kleenex box while reading them."
1,Just another fashion shoot,"...I expected these photographs to be edgier and rougher. It turns out to be fashion magazine-quality stills of a few young models with 3-day stubble. Its only claim to ""art"" is that he uses a color filter on some of the pictures. Very uninteresting."
5,Something altogether different!,"I loved this book, plain and simple. It's not as conventional as the typical male-nude coffee table book. The color images are printed (in many cases) without color correction, and they have a yellowish or greenish cast to them that seems to place them in a different time. Most of the models are european and seem completely un-self-conscious, looking natural and beautiful in front of the lens. The settings are interesting and somewhat voyeuristic, but intimate. It's a beautifully-bound book that would look great on any coffee table."
2,Huh?,"It may just be me (and going on previous reviews it looks like it is!) but this was quite a ridiculous book, with an extremely implausible premise of 100 Chinese submarines filled with commandoes travelling thousands of miles across the globe, *absolutely and completely in secret*, and attacking New York. Ignoring the fact that it would have been virtually impossible to keep the departure of 10000 troops and 100 submarines from China secret from satellite and HUMINT sources from a multitude of Western countries.All that aside, the action was okay, if sporadic. A little too ""talky"" for me, and a bit too melodramatic.In the end it left me ""unfufilled"", and the sense I had just wasted a couple of days of my life that I will never get back."
1,RED SKY AT MORNING - READER TAKE WARNING!,"Just like the month of March, this book started out like a lion and ended up like a lamb. Written before 9/11, there were places which made me cringe in light of that tragedy. But forget that the story line after the first two chapters was so far beyond fiction with a hundred submarines gaining entry into New York Harbor undetected and landing all these Chinese troops. Many of the characters proved to be very annoying and contributed nothing to the story. I wondered why some of them even existed in the book. The action was - for the most part - completely implausible. There were a few places that held the reader's interest, but only a few. Ideas were introduced and disappeared instead of being developed in the plot. I kept turning pages to see if it got better. It didn't. And after 400+ pages leading to a climax, the ending came very abruptly and ridiculously in less than 10 pages. Don't bother reading this one."
1,READER TAKE WARNING,"RED SKY AT MORNING was written before the horrifying 9/11 disaster. Even so, Paul Garrison's ""glorification"" of the Chinese admiral and his worthy crew left a bad taste in my mouth. How can one ""admire"" a megalomaniacal madman who has no qualms in bombing one of the largest cities in the world; sending in thousands of troops to overtake our financial district; kill innocent citizens and law enforcement agents; and force the city's mayor to hide out in a bunker beneath City Hall? Garrison's empathy for these terrorists is unacceptable in my book and this whole novel is worthless because Garrison tidies up his ending with the destruction of one of the World Trade Center buildings and the martyrdom of the Chinese leader. This is totally bull manure!!"
3,No warning needed,"A great book for travel, vacation or any time burner. A little info, pleasant characters and lots of action. Don't ask too many questions and it will sail right along."
3,oK hat-- could be better,Hats are of decent quality.... but not great....Very Light-Weight Construction.For a few cents more - they could have made a much better hat.(I know my hats - I sell large custom orders - Direct from overseas... but my kids wanted these)for the Discounted Price I paid (and had to buy 3 in order to get free shipping)they were JUST OK....if they're NOT on SALE - you'd be crazy to pay $15-$20 for these....I paid I believe $10-$11 (which retail for a fitted cap is so-so)
2,"Not the Worst Repertoire Book, But...","This book has convinced me, once and for all NOT to buy any more chess books by authors who don't use computer programs to check their analysis. Example: page 129, top right, first parentheses: (32...Rd8 33. Rfd6, Rxd6 34. Rxd6, Rc8 35. Rd7, Kg8). Any computer program would instantly spot 34. Rxc6 forcing immediate resignation. This is 1999, not 1899; there is no excuse for such sloppy analytical work, nor is there much reason to buy books featuring analysis that would be refuted by a casual glance at Fritz 5 or even Fritz 1, for that matter. Despite this annoying flaw, and a considerable number of typos and bad grammar, the book is far from being the worst of its type. The games are plentiful and mostly good, and the repertoire is sound. But if you're already at or near Expert strength, you'd probably be better off getting the games from chesslab.com and saving your money for a real chess book."
5,Great book,this book is very informative and anyone looking into AAS you need to study a lot before deciding. This book will help you decide parts of you cycle program.
5,This book is da bomb,"Lots of useful information, you'll be looking like ronnie coleman as long as u follow this guilde religeously for 15-20 years"
5,Great Read.,"This book is an excellent insight into how to correctly use Anabolic Steroids. There is so much Media and Government BS going around about the danger of steroids that it is truely mystifying to me. Why are cigarettes and alchohol not treated the same way, they kill a hell of a lot more people than steroids ever will, the reason of course is moneyThis book gives accurate and intelligent information on the use of Anabolic Steroids. It has been of enormous help to me, I am 51 years old and steroids at my age are a gift from god, I will be using them until I see him. Congratulations to Anthony Roberts on a truely remarkable book."
4,Finally the truth,Finally something the tells the truth about steroids. Not the sound byte myths you hear on the news. Its very educational and teaches you how to use safely
5,"Wow, Finally I found something useful on the Internet",A comprehensive collection of information that will keep you safe while developing your body..
5,good read,"very informative, good read, great for those who want to learn, and not just listen to what people say."
2,Only for someone extremely patient!,"I purchased this shredder at Target (which went under a different model number...T580C). However, the shredder I purchased looks exactly like the shredder pictured and has the same features.After setting up the shredder today, I have already had things get stuck 3 times. I wasn't even over-stuffing the shredder. If you have an insert from junk mail for instance, you HAVE to unfold it before shredding it...otherwise even that will get stuck (even though supposedly you can shred 6 sheets at once).Also, emptying the basket is NOT a breeze. It takes considerable effort to remove the basket, and when you do, some clippings fall into where the basket was sitting causing further clean-up. My patience has truly been tested today. Unfortunately, I have to have a shredder, but this is so much hassle."
1,"Bad design, weak motor, don't bother.","Poor design. Every time you empty the drawer that catches the chad, you have to vacuum out the compartment. There is a switch that must engage or the unit will not work, and the chad builds up at the back of the drawer space.Weak (1.5 amp) motor. The average piece of junk mail has at least 2 pages. Folded in thirds and including the 2 sides of the envelope, the thickness is at least 8. This puppy can't handle it, so you have to open the envelope, take out and separately shred the pieces. I just want to safely get rid of the junk mail, not have a relationship with it.If you want to shred junk mail without opening and separating it, don't buy this turkey. Get one with at least a 2 amp motor and 9 sheet shredding capability."
1,"Avoid, find an alternative","I agree with the other reviews.The basket issue is a hassle. The design also means that if it's not snugged in, the kill switch activates and the shredder won't run -- this is a problem if you have loose confetti at the rear-inside of the unit.After 1.5 - 2 years of *extremely* light use, the activator switch is now acting up and I am having a difficult time shredding *anything*.My wife complained about the speed compared to the office shredder she's used to, but I have no comparison point and this unit may do more in terms of paper security than what she uses at work (i.e. crosscut).If I didn't overload it and kept it lubricated, it did chew through stuff reasonably well. I did experience some jamming, but worked around it by using fewer sheets per feed session."
4,Nice but no miracles here :),"This is my first cat and cat litter box, so I don't have a point of comparison. I have this litter box in titanium, and I think it's as attractive as an indoor outhouse can possibly be. The lid is excellent at keeping flying litter in so far, and it's roomy enough for my 9 month old cat. My kids ripped and flung a few things in their excitement to get all set up for the new kitty, and so the charcoal filter went uninstalled for a few days. Sadly, I can honestly say I notice no difference at all in the level of odor after installing the filter. And no difference at all between the odor from this box and the small cheap-o open box we had at first.That said, I'd still buy it again for the sleek look, compact size and the nice enclosure. I wasn't really expecting it to smell good-- it's a box full of leavings, after all-- but I definitely expected it to contain the litter. And at that it's doing a great job."
1,Too small!,"I bought this without looking at the product in a store beforehand. My poor cat could barely fit in it. While she did her best and didn't have any accidents, I couldn't bear to watch her contort so she could do her business. An extra-large would have been better. She is not a gigantic cat, but she is not a small kitten either. I was also dipleased with the thin plastic. In addition the liners didn't fit well ... rectangular liners for a round product are not a good idea. All in all, this was a waste of money. I sighed as I threw it in the garbage."
2,Dome cat box,The litter box looked bigger online. In my opinion it is too small for an adult cat. I am using it as a cat bed. In the picture the cat must have been a kitten.
4,Great inexpensive cat litter box,"I purchased this litter box for a 2 month old kitten. The closed design is great at keeping the litter from spilling which is the biggest reason why I wanted a closed litter box. Cats can be very careless and I've noticed that this litter box has helped to keep the litter spill to a minimum. The build quality seems good enough and the material is nice and sturdy. I was a little disappointed that the top part doesn't have some sort of locking mechanism, but it hasn't been a problem yet. The little charcoal filter on the top is a nice addition, but I can't tell that it actually does anything to suppress the odor. Overall a great little litter box for a great price. I would buy again if I needed to."
2,"Good Idea, bad design","This litter box is a great idea and works well for containing litter odors, but it contains a major design flaw: the bottom of the dome fits inside the top hood, creating a lip inside the box. Because of this inner lip, when kitty pees against the walls urine catches at the join and runs out onto the floor. As a result, I end up with a puddle of urine sitting underneath the box. This smells much worse than the litter box I had replaced.The company should design the product so that the top portion fits inside the bottom. This would fix the problem."
4,Great Litter Box,"Pros - Pretty, contemporary, kitty privacy, not as small as others described. I think in comparison to the huge step dome it seems small. But my old litterbox was a large and this fits in almost the same area as the large rectangular one. My 12 pound cat love it and has adequate space. I have 2 cats. One of my cats used to toss litter out the old box like crazy, he does not do it with this one as I expected from other reviewers.Cons - Lid does not secure to the bottom. This is not an issue for me as it only makes it easier for me to scoop out litter. But I can understand the people who left comments if your cat pees while standing it will leak out. None of my cats do this so its fine. I didnt even know cats could stand and pee! Well, maybe only the boy cats! lol.Overall - I would recommend it. It makes for nice decor since litterbox styles are limited. Easy to wipe clean."
1,Don't buy this!!,"I found this on-line - it LOOKED great - big mistake. I have 2 cats in a studio apartment, and the litter box is a constant battle. The Booda Dome litter box has been a huge disappointment - the liner won't stay in place; it leaks out of the side; and it in no way prevents litter from making its way out (""clean step"" is not only misleading, it's an outright fabrication.) I just got it, but I'm going to go back to a more basic, rectangular litterbox - at least I know my floor will stay dry and the liner won't slide down into the box."
3,Okay but....,"My two cats have been using two of these for about a year. Generally they're very good. One of my cats is quite neurotic and she scratches the litter a lot, so I am usually cleaning stray litter off the floor. Occasionally (about once a week or so) she'll decide to face the rear of the box, instead of sticking her head out of the opening as she usually does. The unfortunate consequence of this is that her motion is deposited on the floor outside the box, instead of inside. She is a fairly tubby cat, so I would advise a different model for fatter cats. My other, more slender, cat has no problems using them."
2,Much TOO Small,"I had the very large Booda Dome - the one with the ramp inside to cut down on litter tracking. It took up lots of floor space, but I was extremely happy with it.After 1 of my 2 cats passed away I decided to get this box, as I live in a small apartment. I was so sure that this one would work as well as the huge one that I immediately tossed it out.Big regret!!Even though my cat is not large (he's 8-9 pounds), it is so small for him that his [...] hangs out the door on a regular basis when he goes potty.I have started piling the litter up high on the side opposite the door, leaving a tiny bit on the floor of it on the door side, and that seems to help. I still have to clean it twice a day to RE-pile the litter up so he'll turn around so his [...] is inside.I REALLY regret tossing the larger box! I'd much rather give up more floor space than clean up the mess that this one is causing."
2,Good but leaks pee,Our cats pee against the side of the dome and the pee leaks out onto the floor.Otherwise it's good but we can't use it because of the leak.
1,Worthless for adult cats,"I wanted a covered litter box for our screened in porch. The larger cats (15 lbs or so) will not even go in. The smaller cats put their bodies in and lift their rears and pee or poop right out the door. The pan part is too low and even if they turn around the pee goes between the lip of the dome and the pan and gets all over the floor. I would NOT recommend it this litter box, except perhaps for kittens."
2,APO orders beware,"Product arrived 38 days after ordering, since the seller chose to ship this via DHL to my APO address. When DHL turned it over to the USPS, they shipped it parcel post. When it finally arrived, this round litter box had been squeezed into a rectangular box - my cat now has an oval litter box - first on the block. Handle was cracked as well.I'd prefer the seller to opt not to ship to APO instead of messing about this way. What is so hard about shipping Priority Mail via the USPS to your military customers?All in all, a disappointing transaction."
2,GREAT FOR KITTENS-----TOO SMALL OTHERWISE,"Love this box for our kitten but when he became an adult cat (approx 1 yr old) and was approx. 8lbs he became too big for it. Now he wants a larger covered cat box (pooping on the floor until we purchase a larger covered box)So, if you purchase this just know it is probably a cat box for the kitten stage only (or really tiny cats)"
4,Good size for small spaces,"Cool design for a litter box that needs to go in a small space, and it definitely helps keeps litter in the box vs. on the floor. 4 stars because it doesn't have the plastic swing flap."
3,Good sound but headband does not last...,"The sound quality of these headphones is quite good, but after using them for about 3-4 months the headband broke in several places. I didn't misuse them or anything. There seems to be somewhat of an engineering flaw in the adjustment mechanism of the headband. There are weak points on both sides of the headband where flexibility is concentrated. This ultimately weakens the plastic leading to breakage. I would expect better engineering from a company like Sony."
1,"sound ok, durability sucks","Maybe my head is too big, but these broke about 4-5 months after getting them. If you're an exec who keeps good care of things, then maybe these are for you (although you can then afford better). If you are in and out of the subway or pulling them on and off with any frequency, they just fall apart."
2,"Ouch, these are tight!",They hurt my ears after about 15 minutes of wear. I expected a spiral cord for the price you pay (why aren't any pictures showing the cords these days?). I'd expect to pay about $15 for headphones like these. Inflation!
4,wonderful!,"These headphones are great for the price! It has a good punchy sound, with great bass! but unlike other reviews say, i think these headphone's base isn't overpowering, just strong. Also the screw on adapter for the plug-in is nice, but the ridges for the screw can get in the way of some uses. It's bothersome when it's used along with my slimx 550 cd/mp3 player."
1,Bad comfort + bad sound = bad headphones,"For just $20 more I could have gotten the real deal from Sennheiser. The Sony MDR-V300 are without a doubt the worst headphones I've ever bought, stay away!"
1,"Perhaps better off, now that they've broken","I'm not an audio expert, so I've been adequately satisfied with the sound these MDR-V300 phones produce. But maybe I shouldn't be.I'm giving up on them after they broke today for the second time (first the plug, then the plastic headband), To my surprise, the cheap Yamaha RH-2Cs I'm using now are more comfortable and give me previously unnoticed sound details.The V300s have always seemed too small for my head, even with the phones fully extended."
4,sony headphones,"I bought these headphones for my husband's laptop, and they work great. The sound quality is perfect. He listens to things very loud, yet I could barely here whatever it was he was listneing to. These are comfotable and easy to wear, the cord is very long which makes the headphones more accessible. Buy some now!"
3,"Good, but not great.","One of the nice things about these headphones is the ability to be reverse the cups so they can be used as mini-speakers. This helps especially in the dorm setting, where walls are paper thin and speakers don't make much sense.Sound reproduction is decent, but not exactly top notch. Highs come out pretty good, but lows tend to distort. Not bad for the price though.I must say that the contruction of these headphone look a little flimsy. The all-plastic construction seems to have several weak points. The muffs also aren't the type where your ear can go into them. They just give you cushion for your ear."
1,"Sound good, but... OUCH!","These lightweight studio monitor headphones have a very nice sound, but I can't wear them for more than 20 minutes because they just pinch too hard on my ears. I wear glasses, and the headphones push my ears very hard into the arms of the glasses. Owwww! It is definitely not as bad without the glasses, but I need them. This is the first pair of headphones I've had where this is a problem.The cord is very thick, heavy and long and drops down from both earpieces rather than routing one side's cable over the top. This works well for sitting in a chair to listen, but wouldn't be so good for walking around with an ipod.Unfortunately, the earpiece holders are made of plastic. I'm very gentle with my electronics, but that part broke after about 3 months of use."
4,Upgrading from MDR-V150,"I've had a couple of MDR-V150s for a few years and they still work great. The padding is coming off and they both have a broken headband due to my ""fivehead"". I wear them with the headband behind my head as if they were a ""street style"" set, otherwise I'm sure they would crack as quickly as the V150s did.I've had the V300 for a week and the sound quality over the V150 is very noticeably better. I use these at work with my iPhone and they easily drown out my coworkers. No need for those expensive noise cancelling headphones. My music tastes include Latin Jazz, Rap, Hip Hop, Jazz, Funk, Rock, etc. and no matter the genre, these headphones sound great.The only reason I rated it a 4/5 is due to the fact that they didn't see fit to add the on-cord volume controls that exist on the V150."
5,Great Headphones,These are great sounding headphones for the money. I have a few other Sony headphones simular to these but these are without question the best.
3,"good sound, uncomfortable after 2 hours","The sound is extremely adequate for the non-professional. I find it excellent. The long cord is very nice. The headphones do not fold up in any useful way (""folding design"" is really an exaggeration) and hence are not suited to being carried around. The major drawback is that these headphones are insanely uncomfortable to wear for more than 1-3 hours at a time. There is no way to adjust them to be more comfortable. It's a serious problem."
2,"You get what you pay for... no wait, you don't","As others have pointed out, these headphones are incredibly frail. The plastic ends of the headband are so weak, you are likely to have them break just placing the headphones in the wrong position. Supposedly they're comfortable, but I have to disagree here. To each his own I guess, but my ears always hurt after using them. Some of the bigger headphones are softer on the ears, that's sad. Sound quality is decent, but at this price and with all other flaws, it's really not enough to warrant a purchase. It's not a ""value"" buy even at its relatively low price. Two stars for the sound."
4,"Great for TV Watching, Poor for Music","This is the best headphone I have found for watching TV or listening to voice.However, for music it is sibilant, harsh has too much treble. Bass is weak. Extremely fatiguing.I own or have owned just about every high end headphone on the market. Overall these are better than most $35-40 headphones, but both the Koss Porta Pro and Sennheiser PX100 in the same price range are vastly more musical, lighter weight and more portable.However, the reason I keep these around is because I have never found a better headphone for TV watching or listening to spoken recordings. I can make out very clearly with little strain, exactly what is being said. They are quite comfortable and the long cord is nice."
4,"Great for the Price, but not perfect","The headphones have a great sound. The tone is nice and full with a strong bass. I paid $30 for these headphones, but would definitely have paid more if I knew they would sound this good.The few downsides. The headphones' folding design is worthless. They're still too big. I'll put it this way, they're not going into your pocket. While they look good and sound great, these are meant for your desk, not to use with a portable media player. If you're looking for a set of headphones to have on the go, these aren't them. However, if you're looking for a pair of headphones with a great sound to hook up to a laptop, soundboard, or stereo system, these are great."
5,great headphones for the price,"I purchased these headphones a couple of weeks ago and am very pleased with them. The headphones are a tad bit bassy, but perfect for my taste. With these headphones I hear alot of things that I missed in the past with other headphones. In addition, they are very comfortable and have a fairly long cord.To sum it up:Pros:-Nice full and bassy sound-Comfortable-Adapter plug includedCons:-Not the quality you'd expect in a pair of hundred dollar headphones, but definitely good quality for the price.-If the volume is low and the cord ends up getting rubbed near the headphones, you can slightly hear it, but it really is not that big of a problem.-Not very portable. The ""folding"" feature does not make it much more portable"
2,Disappointing Sony,"After looking at Sony headphones, I thought that the MDR V300's would be a good update for a twelve year old pair of MDR V2's.Boy, was that a wrong assessment.The main reason I had thought the V2's needed replacement was that the two ear pads have almost completely lost their effectiveness as padding. But I think a little discomfort might be better than the sound that comes from the V300's.For starters, there is way too much bass, and it so overrides any treble sound as to make most music dull and muddy. I guess it might be ok if you play your music loud and don't care for much balance, but compared to my old 'phones, which have a livelier sound, a lot of the details and higher frequencies are just lost.It's like having lost a whole level of hearing. (Mine's pretty good).The only saving grace about them is they are lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods. But .....Don't know if I'll go back to Sony after this experience.Too bad."
2,Totally Disappointed,"These headphones have nothing but boomy bass. Highly imbalanced sound. I am sort of an audiophile, but when i bought a $35 headphones, i did not expect the moon and the stars. Sad to say i was let down. the basic headphones that came with my discman sound clearer than these.Tried them out with my Dell Laptop, Sony Discman and Harman Kardon amp. Bad performance in every case. Allowed 20 hours of break in, still only slight difference. They sound as if the music is lost somewhere within and all you hear are muffled thuds. This is not at all expected from a respected brand like Sony. I would give a total thumbs down to this product.If all you want to hear is boom and dont care about clarity or balance in sound then maybe this is for you, else stay away. I am returning mine."
2,My Ears Are Killing Me!,The sound from these headphones is okay but the comfort is horrible. I find myself unable to wear them for more than an hour at a time. I've tried both with and without glasses but my ears end up being pressed against my head quite hard. Very uncomfortable. The cord is also a bit of a pain. Spend the extra money on some V600s or V700s.
3,"Fairly nice headphones, but not very comfortable.","These headphones are a definate step up from most ... headphones. The sound is clearer. The appearance is good, a nice sharp silver. The headphone jack is gold plated for better conductivity. The main problem with these is the comfort, or lack thereof. The earpads are rather small, causing these to press against my ears in ways that grow painful over time. I recently bought a pair of ... Sennheisers, which are significantly better."
2,Lots of Better Options for the Price,"These Sonys sound bad. Bloated, muddy bass. Underwhelming mids. Highs that are nothing to write home about. Music sounds as though you are listening to it through Karo syrup and someone is hitting the surface of the syrup with a paddle of some sort.The cord is thick and relatively unwieldy - especially for a phone this lightweight. The forks holding the earcups will break. I had to be really careful with them - a definite chink in the armor of an otherwise relatively sturdy headphone.There are plenty of better options here on amazon.com. Koss Porta Pros, for one. Check some of the lower-end Sennheiser offerings or Beyerdynamic offerings."
2,Not worth the effort,"Sony has let me down yet again with these muddy sounding headphones. I've been doing studio recording for quite some time now and I needed a set of headphones to replace the jensens that I've been using for the past 3-4 years (background: I bought the jensen ""PC"" headphones new off the net for $12 us. and they have clear, bright sound, a little low on the bottom end but well worth the money. They're only now starting to wear out after regular use for extented periods of time). I've tried the sony phones with various setups: analog recorder, digital amp, cd walkman, mini stereo system, pc and the jensens always outshined them. I also got a couple of other opinions that thought the same thing: the sony phones are too bassy. Maybe rap and r&b fans are the crowd sony is targeting. Either way for $40-50, these headphones were lousy. Also, they weren't all that comfortable either...a little too snug for my liking."
2,Unnatural over-emphasis of bass frequencies,"I first wrote a review on this model about a year ago. I have since upgraded to MDR-V600 and Sennheiser 580. All I can add right now is that Sony deliberately enhanced the bass response on this model, contributing to an overall muddling of sound quality.I guess Sony had a different definition of the word ""studio monitor"" when they designed this model.If you like heavy, muddled, boomy bass response, this set is perfect. However, if you ever like listening to something outside the rock/rap genre, get something else. And this goes for the lower studio monitor models from Sony. Skip these ""studio monitors"" at this level, go for something like the 600, which will give you much much cleaner sound."
2,CPC: Cheap plastic crap,"I'm wearing my headphones now listening to music on my laptop, which is good. The bad news is that my right earpiece is attached with shoe-goo because it broke and there was not enough surface area to just glue the stem piece. That is to say, the whole earpiece is glued solid to its bracket so it doesn't move. The over-the-head thing is taped together with packaging tap because it, too, broke when I put the things on my rather large head. They sound fine and all, but I could make a more durable headphone set out of balsa wood. Do not consider these things portable unless your bodyguard is willing to carry them in a padded suitcase.Maybe I should just glue to the earpieces to my head."
2,"Looks Cheap, sounds Ok","I know Sony is the leader in the field of electronics, but this thing sure looks cheaply made. It just has too much plastic. I swear, if it had a no-name brand (Coby, Diawa, etc.)on the side of it I wouldn't know the difference. I almost bought a Koss instead of buying this one and I sure wish I would've tried the Koss."
3,Skip these,Have had these for about 5 years earpads are deteriorating to the point of leaving black bits on my head. Unfortunately this isn't an anomaly since I have another pair of sony headphones (V600) purchased at the same time doing the exact same thing. These haven't been used very often they actually sat unused for about 2yrs until recently. Replacement parts are $26! half the cost of a brand new pair. Called sony they gave me part numbers and prices to replace.
3,meant for house- not meant for pocket- good for music.,"Real clean highs, and good clean lows. Deep deep bass doesn't penetrate that loudly with these phones, they still are better than everything else in their price and size range.Most suited for portable digital music devices. Some of the other ""studio"" headphones suck up all your portable player's amperage, this one needs less juice to give you louder sound.I use them with a mp3/fm player, and have found that the mdr's long cord makes for great FM reception, (even when most of its length is folded up somwehere).These headphones have a weak spot on the headband where two peices of plastic meet. I broke it on one side, duck-taped it fixed, and then broke it on the other side as well, (just for stuffing it in to a jacket pocket). So don't test the plastic. It can't take pressure.Before you get these ones, look at the Sony MDR-501LP headphones listed in 'similar products'. They look like great sounding headphones..."
4,Review,"The bass response is very good and clear. But I cannot say the same thing about the headphone's response to higher frequencies, especially when you listen to classical music, though you can hear the higher frequencies, but they do not stand out, not very sharp. I guess this headphone is designed towards pop and rap rather than classical music.The headphone feels rather light, and except for the earpads, everything else is made of light plastic, there no feel of weight, which one normally associates with quality. But the sound is loud and clear nonetheless.And as for use with portable CD players, one better hook up the CD player through a receiver, than hook the headphone to the receiver, that way the headphone will have a better trebble response through the receiver. Otherwise, the headphone does have good response for the high frequencies."
3,"Great sound, but not really collapsible.","I bought this set of headphones after my cat ate my old ones. They are very comfortable, and the sound is great. Very clear and doesn't get distorted at high volume. I use them primarily for video games and mp3s on my laptop.The downside however is that although advertised as foldable, I wouldn't really quailify them as such. I think that they were designed without being collapsible in mind, and then some exec said wait, these sorta fold up, advertise that on the package as a feature. Secondly, they have a long wire (which is great) however it doesn't wind up around the phones very well when they are ""folded"" and comes loose all the time in my bag.If I didn't have to take them around with me however, then I would give them 5 stars."
3,"acceptable sound, prone to break",I've had two pairs break under normal usage (riding around in my backpack). They're simply not designed for anything approaching street use.
1,Kindle Edition awful quality--Buy the book if you want to actually read the text!,"Haven't even gotten involved in the book yet, because the quality of the Kindle edition is so poor. It looks not unlike some of the low-quality copies professors scanned for reading packets. Some words are broken up in the middle with no rhyme or reason, and no amount of retweaking combinations of font size and words per line gets the text flowing well. The text to speech option is essentially useless with the amount it uses ""percent"" as an extra word--presumably in the places where words are broken up in the middle--and the words itself look like the ""font smoothing"" option was left off. It's actually a chore to read, and certainly wasn't worth paying for. I wouldn't have minded just buying the hard copy. If you're going to sell a digital product, do it right or don't do it at all. The cost might not have been high, but this is so much worse than any of the free editions I've downloaded. I'm really disappointed."
5,Great Informative book,I like this book because it got good explanation of the ring network and overhead bytes that I am trying to understand from the other books I got. It also has a good explanation of SDH which we use here in Australia.
4,"A ""Must Have"" ATM Reference Book","This book provides comprehensive coverage of a very complex subject. The material is well organized, has numerous illustrations, and presents technical concepts in an easy to understand format. Although the grammar could be improved, there were no technical errors or misleading descriptions. All things considered, this text is a worthy addition to any technical library."
3,A reasonable text to understand SONET,Ignoring the grammatical/syntactical errors and inconsistent line tabulations. I feel this is a fairly reasonable book to understand the structure of SONET. He does a satisfactory job in explaining how SONET data is constructed from the PDH structure. I like the fact that he at times repeats the essential details which helped me remember them and not have to refer to earlier pages. I felt at times he could have done more to explain certain points n more detail; e.g how does positive/negative frequency justification affect the design and buffer threshold. He does not explain how the data (email/telephone/fax) fetches its way across to its destination. I just got the basic awareness of SONET and will have to read other books to get a complete picture.
1,One of the worst book I've ever read,"The book is poorly organized. It contains a lot of sentences like ""discussed earlier"", ""to be discussed in detail next"", etc.This book is poorly written. Even if you know the subject, you still cannot understand what the author is trying to say. If you don't know the subject, you won't get a single clue by reading the author's explanation.I would put ""0"" star for this book if I could do it. I really feel sorry to waste my money on this book."
3,Ow my ears....,"These headphones served me fairly well as far as the auditory side is concerned, but as for comfort, they performed far below my expectations. My ears began to ache after just 30 minutes of use, no matter what size adjustment I used. I have found that I seem to have sensitive ears and that may have been the problem, seeing as other people use these headphones without discomfort.If in your experience you have sensitive ears, do not purchase these headphone."
3,DJ'S,"i am dj, i used my headphones daily for, spinning records, listening to music, and exercising in the gym.About 3 weeks ago the left hand side of the lever that holds ear piece together started cracking, and eventually broke.These sound magnificent, but heavy users beware, these will break after about a year of heavy use.Ok i gotta read more review and buy more durable headphones, hope this helped"
2,OUCH,"After about an hour of wearing these, I feel like my head was squeezed in a vice.As for the sound, it's not bad but the mid-bass is overwhelming and the bass extension is pretty poor. You will like the sound if you are after relatively small headphones that have lots of bass (for their size). If you want to listen to classical, or something that requires more balanced headphones, these aren't for you. They are catered to the ""DJ"" crowd, and would probably do a good job at that as they have very good sound isolation."
3,"Not as great as expected, but ok","Sound quality: Pretty good, though I expected more bass. I listen to bass-heavy techno, and I find myself wanting more bass. Depending on the quality of the sound you're listening to, can be pretty nice experience though, with some crisp highs and decent mid-range. Don't expect to be able to play these loudly in a quiet place without disturbing people.Construction: Seems pretty solid, but I've heard that the plastic will eventually start to crack, which I can definitely understand from the creaking I hear when you twist the cups to their maximum. Sturdy, but also pretty heavy as headphones go, in my opinion.Comfort: This is probably the worst part for me. After about 45 minutes, my ears are in pain because the headphones squeeze your head pretty hard. That, coupled with the fact that the ear pads aren't very puffy, thus don't really ""cushion"" your ears at all."
3,"Great sound, but you better have small sized ears.","PROS: These earphones offer excellent sound... very good bass, clear treble/mid-range.CONS: They are uncomfortable to wear for extended listening. Sony's ear-cup design is round, not oval, and the cushioning they use is not soft. I have average sized ears and I constantly have to adjust these earphones to relieve pinching. Other reviewers have mentioned this deficiency... please BELIEVE them!!!!! Also, construction looks like it may not hold up with heavy use or abuse.Summary: If you have average sized ears or larger and want ear surrounding headphones, I suggest buying a more comfortable pair."
4,Good Choice,"So these really are the best Dj/Remix headphones out there right now, for this price. As you should know the sound is great, they have huge Drivers 50mm or something crazy so that Bass kicks which is nice when you are spinning records. Now they do have some minor down sides. Those being that the the shape of the actually earphone is round, which is kind of odd and does not give you/me the real comfy fit that you get with oval shaped ear phones. Also the leather on the ear piece has been known to crack very quickly. I have had mine for less than 8 months and the leather is already cracking on them. But otherwise they are a gem and a good buy for anyone looking for a good set of headphones, regardless of if you are ""DJ"" or not. 100% worth the money."
5,Like Nothing You've Ever Heard!,"These are excellent headphones! I had some $80 Koss headphones before these and the Sony's are much better. Their bass is astounding, and mid's and highs are clear and crisp. The only downside I have found is that they squish your ears a little, but if you don't have to wear them for more than 3 or 4 hours at a time, they're very comfortable. The coiled cord, folding design, and the supplied screw-on mini plug to 1/4 inch adapter are neat features. I'd reccomend these headphones to anyone who wants great sound."
2,Buy the HD 280 Senns Instead!,"These will break on you, very quickly - believe me - I'm a DJ that's given up and decided to go to the 280's! What happens is that in a short period and even after taken care of these, the swivel cups/plastic thing will crack and break and the cups will no longer fit closely to your head....they will then be useless and since this usually happens shortly after a year you will no longer have your mfr's warranty!Countless other DJ's will tell you the same thing, save your money and get something better -- the HD 280's sound better, fit better, and give you more value for your money. They are cheaper and parts are easily available and easily replaceable....unlike Sony's 700's. Do the right thing, don't buy these! You'll be happy you listened to my advice!"
4,Watch out for fakes though...,"Finding the real version of these headphones can be quite a hassle if you are not careful. There are probably more fakes now than there are real Sony makes out on the market. One of the best places to find these fakes? eBay. Trust me. I have been there and done that. The best way to tell? The real ones are made in the Philippines and say so, along with a ""CE"" copyright mark clearly marked. The drivers have serial numbers on the back, and they are actually really comfortable. The fakes are very uncomfortable, and break very easily. There is a major sound difference, and the lead is very poorly made on the fake and will also break very easily. BE AWARE! The real Sony version is amazing! The fakes are pretty bad, and though the fakes will always be ""on sale"" for about $50 to $70 cheaper, they are by no means a steal."
3,"Great sound, terrible construction","I'm on my second pair of these headphones, the first pair fell apart like a lot of people here have described; cracks in the area of the swivel joints which eventually leads to a poor fit and, ultimately, not being to use them at all. If I were a club DJ and I used them, as many do, on one ear, it might not be a problem. But I'm a radio DJ and I like a nice, snug fitting pair of cans. My first pair fell apart after only about 2 years.So why did I buy another pair? Because the sound is great! I'm very picky when it comes to headphone sound quality. I bought and returned 3 pairs of headphones before I finally decided to bite the bullet and get another pair of MDR-V700s. It's been a little less than a year, and the cracks are already starting to show on the left joint.Hard to say if I'll get another of the same when these fall apart, which I'm sure they will. Any suggestions for more durable cans that have just as good sound quality?"
3,Good headphones until they broke a year later.,I am a working DJ and I bought these headphones exactly a year ago. One side has just recently went out on them. Up to now they were great headphones that I recommended to others. Take into consideration that I use them every weekend and at home when practicing. If you are a working DJ I don't think the price is bad for a year or so of constant use. I've read the other headphone reviews and it seems all of them tend to fall apart when they get the same amount of use. I may end up buying another pair or trying the Pioneer headphones.
2,Padding already coming loose...,"... on the right ear cup after the first week. These headphones would be pretty good if the construction wasn't so shoddy. These aren't cheap either at $90. Had I known, I would have spent the extra $20-30 for a sturdier pair of headphones."
2,Excellent sound but brittle frame,"To suggest that these headphones were made for DJ's is laughable. They would never hold up to professional use. The MDR-V700 certainly has excellent sound and is pretty comfortable, but the plastic frame is brittle--I'm talking EGGSHELL brittle. I had mine only a few weeks before they began developing cracks. The only reason they have not crumbled to dust is that I've been pouring Superglue on them almost every week. What a shame Sony paired first-rate electronics with a Dollar Store-quality plastic frame."
5,Two times a charm!,"This is my second pair of Sony MDR-700DJ's. The first pair I sat on and shattered the ear cups, but managed to make due with them. I was impressed with the sound but could only use them at home. I decided to purchase another pair because I was impressed with the sound production, even though I squashed my original pair(LOL!) Certainly, Sony and the MDR-700J's did not disappoint me the 2nd time around. I enjoy the professional look, build, and of course the professional sound quality from MDR-700DJ's. This time around, I will make sure the seat, or chair is empty when I decide to sit at home or away. I am VERY much pleased the second time around with my MDR-700's! The only negative about the Sony MDR's, if you are 6 feet and 200 pounds, the MDR-700's will not hold up to such a butt size. . .LOL!"
5,amazing,"i've had these headphones for 6 years now, and they have been used for thousands of hours (with atleast 700 hours a year * 5 years = 3500 hours (i've probably had more use...) ), and taken a good beating now and then (dropped, thrown, crushed). They have amazing lows and true bass, and clear highs - i prefer these headphones to any others, and plan on buying another pair soon. The pads have been deteriorating from extensive use. You really get what you pay for. Ff you enjoy music, put down the $90-150 to get these and you won't be sorry that you did."
5,2nd pair,"For the price you can't beat it. nice and comfortable, really loud with good punch. isolates really well. Great for dj use and like I said for the price get a pair.for the price I'm very satisfied. When I first owned a pair of these they cost me $150 got my new pair for $70 plus shipping good deal!"
3,Sony MDR-V700DJ Headphones,"The headphones that I am reviewing are great for a begining DJ. I have heard better sounding DJ headphones. For the money you can't beat the price. If you need the headphones for cueing thay are great. Not for everyday use because, the ear pads will tend to wear on the ears."
3,Probably Better for other uses,"I had the sony XB-500s before and liked them a lot, but it was time to get new ones. I had a friend who said these were the best he's ever had, so I decided to give them a try. If you've seen the XB-500s, you can see the difference in styles. that being said, the XB-500s were much better to me for general listening. they were more comfortable and lighter, and had more punchy bass.That being said, I could see these being very good for someone who wants a flatter sound. Don't get me wrong, they are very good headphones, however a phone/mp3 player is not strong enough to push them because they require more power to get the most out of them, so you'll need a headphone amp for that. however they are perfect for a computer."
5,These things ROOOOOOOOCK!,"I wanted to refute what I've read on here about these being for DJ use. I couldn't disagree more. I hate dance, rap and anyting to do with a club or DJ. These phones are excellent for rock or anything i've tested them on. Tried out Hendrix, Floyd, Zeppelin, Metallica, Megadeth, Marley, Janes Addiction, Maiden and more and I have absolutely no complaints. I can maybe notice a little about the mids being overpowered in a few spots but the base and highs sound so freakin' good it blows me away. I cannot compare the 7506's but may have purchased those if I had done more research first. You really can't go wrong with these. I can't speak for the durability but after reading the reviews I will not fold them up and plan on using them at home 95% of the time. The sound quality of these is astounding. Don't believe the negative rants...."
4,Great sound...Then they break. :(,"These are probably the best headphones i have ever bought in my life. The sound is pretty good, i'm sure there are better but given the price they stand up pretty well.Where they don't stand up though, is durability. Expect them to break, and to be very sad when they break. They'd be a lot nicer if they weren't made out of plastic.I would shop around and maybe look at some metal headphones (I assume they exist) or other reviews before you buy them."
1,$250 is highway robbery!!,These things are discontinued. When they were in production the SRP was $149. You could find these all over the internet and dj shops for $90-100. They are good Dj headphones but are made from cheap plastic. I went through 4 pairs of these. Anyone that pays $250 for these is an idiot and is getting bent over.
5,Best Headphones out there!,"I got this for a friend over a year ago & barely now they're showing signs of use. Sony deff made a good job on this one.The bass lines are so neat & clear...and no matter how high you put the volume, still sounds clean."
4,"Excellent sound, heavy headset","I use these headphones for two to three hours a day. I absolutely love the clarity of sound they provide, very rich sound. I'm very happy with that. I will say, though, that they're very heavy and tend to hug my head so tightly that my ears hurt a bit afterwards. However, I know they're for professionals and a snug fit is important but I wanted to mention it. Also, a few earlier reviewers mentioned shoddy construction on the swivel piece, said it was plastic. Mine looks like it's made of metal and seems very sturdy, although I've only owned it for about six weeks, so it's hard to tell."
4,Nice Sound... But,I loved the sound quality of these... However...They are EXTREMELY uncomfortable to wear for a long period of time. There isn't enough room for your ear so it squishes your ears against your head and HURTS...Wish they weren't so plasticy....
5,Great Headphones,"I'm a dj and of all the headphones i've used this one is pretty good. If you love mixing it deliver clear sounds, bass is very distinctive."
4,Nice Headphones,"These headphones sound great and I love them. I only have a few complaints. The headphones are a little heavy resulting in the headphones slipping off my head. The other small problem I have is when I listen to them for over an hour, the pressure from the headphones hurts my ears. What I started to do was to take the headphones off every 20 minutes for about a minute and everything goes fine. They have superior sound quality and the swivel-ear thing is magnificent."
2,Reclamacion,"En el caso de esta compra, se me envio un audifono y se cargo el costo de dos equipos en mi tarjeta de credito. Por favor, necesito que se me tramite el credito.SaludosIvan"
5,A Very Satisfied Customer,"Forget what you have read, these are the best dj headphones in the market (I should know, i'm a dj). i've had the same pair for two years straight. i'm guessing that the people who say they're flimsy doesn't take care of them. now for the review: they are very comfortable, they're loud (just the way i like it) because of their design, you don't hear the ambient noise at all (love that). if you're a dj, the single cup function is great. now the money maker:the bass, you just don't hear the bass, you feel it, they actually vibrate when the bass kicks in. in my opinion, these are the best headphones EVER!!!"
4,Great Headphones,"These headphones are great for everything if you're just listening to it on your computer, ipod, or actual DJing. A lot of sound quality does come from the file itself as well as a good soundcard / player but if it's good quality...these headphones surely do meet their standards. The one downside I have with them is that they aren't too comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I don't know if it's because I have weird shaped ears since some people say they are comfortable, but this is just my opinion. Bass and Sound Quality are an A+, i've seen some other headphones priced well over the $300 mark and the Sony MDR-V700's definitely compete with them. This purchase was well worth my money and another great purchase from Amazon."
