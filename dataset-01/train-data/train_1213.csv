4,Fantastic machine minus the frother.,"My wife and bought this to replace a more expensive coffeeemaker that decided to quit working after just a year. Since having the Mr. Coffee, we have been nothing short of impressed with its overall quality and ease of use. The frother however, could be designed a bit better because it is difficult to get the cup under it while the machine sits on the counter."
1,you get what you pay for,"I read the reviews before I purchased this coffee maker, they were all positive for the most part.After I received it, I brewed two pots of coffee, they brewed well but the coffeee was ""WARM"" not hot. Same for the expresso maker. I call Mr. Coffee customer service and they told me to return it to one of their service centers, which I did and was told I would get a replacement. I asked if the replacement unit did the same thing what would be my recourse, (this is where you need to close attention), I was told, ""I would not be able to get a refund ever on a defective product but only replacements. I'm hoping that the replacement unit works well and HOT, I dont think I should have to ""nuke"" my coffee each time to get it hot...perhaps a design flaw?Unfortunatel, this disclaimer wasnt anywhere in the original add from Amazon.com. BEWARE people!"
2,Good enough but leaks a lot,"This was supposed to be my ""good"" coffee maker, since i was always buying the cheap 20 dollar ones. well guess what, the 20 dollar ones work better for regular coffee and do not leak, I swear this is the most leaky coffee maker and pot that i have ever used."
3,Mr coffee drip/espresso maker!,"This coffee maker worked very well for the year or so it worked. the little hose that brought the hot water to the coffee fell off and whenever I tried to put it back together it just would fall off again. The only problems i had with it were that the drip coffee took a long time to finish brewing, but the coffee was good once it was finished. The espresso always was good and the frother worked very well. Overall i liked this machine until it stopped working, i only wish it had lasted a little longer..."
3,the carafe,"I had the leaking problem with the carafe, too... when I try to poor the coffee to a mug, it spills everywhere - which I think is a big problem since I have to clean the counter each time I want to drink a cup of coffee. I would give a 5-star otherwise. I haven't tried to make espresso yet."
4,This is great!,"I love this coffee/espresso maker. It does not take up much space, it is fast, and it makes very good coffee/espresso. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is cause any time I make a latte or something like that I have to microwave it for a minute to make it hot enough for me."
4,Decent dual machine,I am still practicing to get the water levels right for the strength of coffee/espresso I prefer. It would be nice if the lid to the coffee carafe came off. Also it is hard to see how much water (if any) is left in the espresso/steamer tank. Still getting the hang of the steam wand as well but overall a great machine for the reasonable price.
2,You get what you pay for?,"Machine makes a decent cup of regular coffee, but the carafe is almost impossible to pour from without dripping. Even if you use the thumb lever to lift the lid you still have coffee dripping unless you barely dribble it out of the spout. The espresso part makes a cup of mud, more like Turkish coffee than Italian Espresso. The holes in the coffee holder are too large and let too much of the fine coffee through. There is none of the ""la crema"" foam on top of the espresso like you usually get from a decent espresso machine. I don't make latte's or Capuccino so I can't comment on the steaming part of the machine. I guess for $60 you get what you pay for, it does make a decent cup of regular coffee."
1,Get a Krups.,"I bought this to replace a Krups espresso/coffee maker combo, and I should have listened to the other bad reviews. You get what you pay for. I have other Mr. Coffee products that I really like, but this is not one. Coffee is too slow to brew, tastes bad, and is awkward to set up in the first place. The components don't fit together well - I have to force the carafe into place. It's very cheap, and I wish I had forked over the dough and gotten a better machine."
1,The espresso maker sucks!,Well I've had this maker for almost 3 years and in all honesty it has sucked since I've had it. Seriously don't even bother with the espresso maker because it comes out luke warm. Any kind of coffee is just bad at that temperature. Especially espresso. And if you're thinking of using the steamer attachment forget that too because the pressure is too low. Oh yeah and I have to agree with other reviewers about the leaking issue. The caraffe has leaked probably since day 1. I just wrote it off but it is pretty annoying. It also takes up a lot of space. The only plus to this monster is it does look fairly decent. That's why it got 1 star. But it's supposed to make good coffee not just sit there and look good. Save your money and if you want decent espresso buy an italian stovetop espresso maker and a SEPARATE coffee maker. Hope this review helps you make the right decision.
4,Great addition for the party,"The ladle worked very well with the skeleton punch bowl also available from amazon. Works as you would expect, although I used it mostly for show. Wish the handle were just a little longer, but its not enough to make me lament the purchase"
4,eye of the beholder,"David Carson first made a name for himself debunking high-brow design aesthetics with a decidedly impulsive and intuitive approach to the printed page. Here he similarly debunks high-brow photography, with this collection of obscured, abstracted and often out-of-focus photographs. These lo-fi photographs are then elevated to another level by Philip Meggs's typically lofty writing... be sure to check out Carson's grungy photograph of an empty chair, which Meggs decides is a study about ""the absence of people."" (That put a smile on my face, at least.) Aside from the almost farcical nature of the writing that accompanies these images, they are still effective on a purely emotional, visceral level, that same base that Carson has operated so well at as a designer for so many years. Who knows, you might even want to use it as a coffee table book... although you might confuse your company."
4,Innovative Design,"David Carson, editor of RAYGUN magazine has yet another book for readers. This book shows not only visual asthetics, but also a fair amount of writing, given by Carson himself of what exactly his appraoches are to certain spreads. He also explains his experiences in designing, and has a very unique way of looking at things. He has done work for David Bowie in the past, and many images used for Nine Inch Nails' ""The Fragile"" are found in this book as well. David Carson is an intellegent person, and it can clearly be seen in the 'not what you'd expect from a designer' look of this book, with photos he took only with a standard 35mm camera and developed at a nearby one hour photo. Also keep an eye out for a soon to be released Nine Inch Nails DVD, which was designed and packaged by David Carson, along with some other contributions."
2,"Does not include any original Irish (""Gaelic"") text","I'm sure this is an excellent translation, but I much prefer those versions of old literature that have translations alongside the original language, such as so-called ""parallel text"" or ""dual-language"" editions."
4,What I needed,"A little bigger than what I was looking for, but this is what I needed. Organizes my loose change, and hides away nicely into my center counsel."
5,nice quality,"Awesome purchase, just make sure you have one or the smaller ""can sized"" cup holders. or it will rattle around. but It fits great in the can ones. holds $10 in change."
3,Good change holder but sometimes hard to get coins out,I like this change holder. It was exactly what I was looking for. I use it in my mini-van which has many cup holders. So losing one cup holder was no big deal. The only problem I have with it is that I often have problems removing pennies or dimes.
5,Loved it,"Arrived really, really quickly and was exactly what I was looking for! Excellent service. Will order again soon in the future."
5,Coin Holder,I bought one for each car. They are so handy when you need change. They are also very inexpensive. I really like them. Thank You
4,Handy in the drive through.,"Much better than trying to fish coins out of my ash tray. Keep the ultra dirty coins out, though or they may stick together which makes them hard to extract."
4,cool,"This works perfectly. I like that it fits in the cup holder just fine, keeps plenty of change handy if needed"
2,Too small; No compartments,"I was very disappointed in this case. The 12 amp 4-1/2"" grinder won't even fit with the cord attached. Nothing to keep the tool from flopping around inside. I saw the case that was included with the 4-1/2"" 8 amp grinder, and it showed a bracket for the tool and a quick reference guide for disc selection.Come-on Milwaukee; you built the tool well, surely you can put together a case that's matched to the tool. Especially for $34.50.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
2,No frills box,"I purchased a steel carrying case for my Milwaukee drill a year ago and was quite pleased with it. It had a foam-cushioned bracket inside that cradled the drill, and also included a tray that was able to hold bits and accessories. I decided to purchase a case for my Milwaukee grinder as well, so I purchased this item. Unfortunately, the features of Milwaukee's drill case were not carried over into this one. This case is empty... no bracket to keep the grinder from sliding around inside and no accessory tray. For half the price, I could've bought a small Craftsman tool box that's twice the size AND includes the tray. This is much too expensive to simply be an 'empty box'."
1,garbage,do not buy this sword it is a dollar store reject. it's a waste of money. it was supposed to be a gift but had to tell them they weren't getting it.
5,The Best Explanation for Non-Scientists,"Kitty Ferguson has an amazing gift for translating incredibly difficult concepts from modern physics into language that anybody can grasp. ""Prisons of Light"" is a great example. If you want to understand black holes, but you know nothing of calculus or quantum dynamics, than this is the book for you. It is enjoyable reading and informative in the extreme. It is the place to start in this subject area. Highly recommended!"
4,God-Confidence,"I love reading Donna Partow's study books! She always stretches my thinking and guides me in the next step of my faith. Her lessons are not only easy to understand, but she writes like you are talking to a friend you have known for years. She is funny and real. Her books are a great read for any woman wanting to know more about Christ. Great for Bible studies or book clubs, too!"
2,Not quite what I had in mind.....,"I had had the impression this book would have more text addressing the spiral and its spiritual symbolism, with illustrations throughout. Instead, the book had a brief 30 page introduction with page after page of various artworks that feature a spiral somewhere in their design. I found the pictures to be poorly notated and wished that each photo had a more in-depth discussion to accompany it."
1,"Whatever you do, don't buy this!","This CD player is officially the worst piece of crap I've ever bought. Simultaneously burning my $40 and flushing it down the toiltet would have been a better experience than wasting it on this God awful product. The ""180-second esp-Xtreme"" is so Xtremely terrible that it unmercifully skips during even the slowest walk. Therefore, because you can't actually take it with you anywhere to enjoy your music, it's only convenient portability feature is it's relative ease to hurl against a brick wall. The only good thing about this product is that it didn't break when my frustrations reached so high that I actually did slam it on the sidewalk."
5,"A spiritual, sensual, mysterious journey to one's truth","I love a good story. I love a good life's story. If I were to sit and talk with you, I would try and get you to tell me your life's story, with all the intimate details. That is what makes a great novel and that is what makes the ""The Treasure Codes"" an intriguing, mystical beauty of a novel. You feel as though you know the main character ""The Seeker"" and you are taken on a journey full of love, heartbreak and self-discovery. Puran Perez brings you into a timeless world, painted with poetic, erotic brilliance.If you love the works of Carlos Castanada, Marge Piercy, Anita Diamant, Anne Rice and perhaps the poet Rumi, you won't be able to put this book down."
4,Milwaukee Carry Case for 13 & 15 amp grinder,"The case is sturdy with plenty of room for accessories (wire wheel, extra grinding disks, etc.). I recommend it be used only with grinders that have the removable power cord from the tool for this case. If you have a grinder with a fixed power cord the case is rather short and would cause the power cord to bend nearly 90 degrees too close to where the cord enters the tool. It would be too tight and eventually cause the electric wire to break.Milwaukee 48-55-0890 Carrying Case for 13 and 15 Amp GrindersAlthough the cost was more than I wanted to spend it was worth it in terms of how long I'll own the tool and the protection the case will provide to lengthen the life of the tool and convenience of keeping all the pieces in one place as well as the ease of portability. It was worth the investment."
1,Just another cheap Chinese knife,"Schrade had better institute quality control on the suppliers is uses. This knife arrived dull, had poor fit from scales to bolsters, scales poorly finished and a ""reconstituted pleather"" case (suspect it might dissolve if allowed to get wet).I have bought knives on eBay for several years as raffle prizes for my fishing club (many well under $10 including shipping) and consider this to be among the worst. Hopefully the winner won't be as disappointed as I was."
1,i was forced to give one star,"This movie was horrific (yeah, i was scared, scared that this was the worst movie I have seen in ages!!!) and barely stuck with the first movies concept. The plot didnt make much sense and even a secondary plot was started and never completed...seems like they just made a movie to just be making one. Me and my bestfriend wanted to poke our eyeballs out and couldnt wait for it to be over...but we are finishers, we wanted to give it a chance considering how much we liked the first Pulse. I would tell the people who made this movie...try again"
2,That's not Santa in that red suit,"This is what happens when you buy an entire series before knowing whether or not any of them are worth viewing (never mind keeping for future viewings). As punishment, I watched all three Pulse movies in a row and felt deservedly chastised as a result. It wasn't just the matter of the money that I wasted, it was the time lost on such a dreary series.As for this film, it went from the global realization of the first film to a simple family melodrama complete with a cheating ex-husband, his mistress, his ex-wife, and a daughter caught in the middle. While I appreciated the attempt to personalize the issue, the problem remains the same; if you don't find the original premise valid, going smaller with the story isn't going to help. It's still a silly idea and a sillier solution (hiding out in ""dead zones""). Not even the novelty of filming it from the perspective of some of the ghosts could save this tedious effort."
2,What was that ....,I did like the first movie...but after 10 minutes of this one i fellasleep as it sure was'nt interesting enought to keep me awake.
1,makes Feast look OK!!,"I didn't like the first part that much but this one don it for me, no more more watching Pulse for me.Actually the director and the others should hang them self."
3,2 and 1/2 stars really...,mark's a great writter. i've read all his books. this outline like several of his others sadly falls a little flat.
2,Incomplete Product Information,"This product may be what I need but there is insufficient information to make a buying decision. There is no mention of size. How do you determine size? Waist or hips? What material is it made of? Is it adjustable? If so, how? Is it washable? What type(s) of hernias is it appropriate for? I don't imagine this is a returnable item so the answers to all of these questions need to be in the product description."
3,"Rug Ok, but nothing great","The rug was pretty well the size advertised, but it certainly seems pretty thin....if you're expectings something plush, you might be disappointed. Overall, it seems a little expensive given how thin it is"
4,Good Read,I am surprised by the negative reviews for this book. I have read many romances and although this may not be the very best I really enjoyed it and finished it in record time. It definitely deserves a four star rating. Give it a try--you won't be disappointed.
3,Not perfect,"Plot description on this book's Amazon page. It was an OK read, just not riveting. WINTER GARDEN is a much better story. The two main characters were good, just not great. There is little mystery; you can sort of guess what happened, and not too much tension--sex or anything else. If you are a fan of this author, try this one. However, if you are a first time reader try her other title, WINTER GARDEN first."
2,Clunk,"I really tried to stick with this book but finally gave up. Mary Marsh, the Longfellow family's seamstress, agrees to help discover the secrets behind Marcus Longfellow's sister's death. Every movement, every thought, every glance, every twitch sizzles with inexplicable tension between Mary and Marcus until I wanted to pull out the pages in the book with annoyance. Each minute action is subjected to prolonged scrutiny and introspection. And the whole story, at least the part which I read, unfolds in a creepy, decidedly unromantic way."
3,Not quite perfect,"Part of the book's problem was its unevenness. Sometimes it really held my interest and other times I just wanted to be finished with it. I like Marcus a lot (a lot, alot), but Mary doesn't impress me much. In fact, I found her annoying. Somehow, though, I cannot see this woman who so loved the sea and wilds of Cornwall, hating to leave that behind, happy to follow Marcus to the dry deserts of Egypt.The letters from the sister that opened each chapter were a very nice touch, adding to the reader's understadning, providing foreshadowing, and making the sister an active character in the story. The who-done-it is also well executed, as are the love scenes.All in all, it's okay and has its good moments, but it's not great -- and definitely not perfect."
5,ALMOST PERFECT,"ASHWORTH IS THE REIGNING MISTRESS OF DEEP ROMANCE. THERE IS NO ONE WHO EXPLORES PROFOUND, COMPLEX PERSONALITIES BETTER. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE MEN IS SUBLIME AND THE WOMEN ARE INTELLIGENT AND MULTI-LAYERED. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Average,"After reading My Darling Caroline I rushed out and got this book. Sadly, I was somewhat disappointed. I wasn't able to become emotionally involved with the characters. As I was reading I could almost feel what was coming next and that just wouldn't allow for me to stay ""in the moment"" of the book. When I finished the book I didn't feel there was anything to savor about it. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but for me it just felt average."
2,Wrong Edition makes all the difference,"I actually bought this book as a mistake. There is a newer 1998 Edition of this book that is very much different, and much much better with larger pages, and lots more photos.This book is not worth reading if you are able to buy the new one."
3,Not for hedge fund professionals,"I was thoroughly disappointed with the material in the book. As someone who evaluates hedge fund investments and performance on a daily basis, I am always on the lookout for new research. Wiley Books has traditionally done a very good job of publishing authors who contribute to the hedge fund investment research process. This book fails to break any new ground - in fact, it rehashes what any professional in the hedge fund world already knows. However, I did give it 3 stars because it may be useful for someone who is looking to break into the industry or is just starting out in the HF indsutry. And for any quants in the HF industry - stay away from this book. There is nothing to learn from it."
1,This one is the same as the others......,"This ins't the the first of Amazon's Hedge Fund review books that I've purchased and read. Don't expect any real insight into hedge hund performance, as hinted by the title, that isn't provided by any number of titles authored previously. This genre all pretty much say the same thing and it is a bore to read the repititous materal that they all provide. Save your money and your time. And these are the words as a real industry participant. Life is too short.Punter"
1,54-008 hammer,"This is allegedly a Stanley hammer but don't be fooled by the picture. The one I received was a cheap copy made in Mexico. It had a cast, not forged head that was held on the handle with epoxy. The head was not straight or perpendicular to the handle, and it was a grey painted head with a paper label varnished on. The handle was painted black and had a paper label glued on. It made me ill to think that this is being passed off as a real Stanley hammer. I sent it back immediately and will never order another Stanley tool from Amazon."
3,it's a Decent Tribute Album to Babyface,"there was a time when Babyface was the Hottest Songwriter&producer in Popular Music which seems so long ago now,but there was a time when you couldn't avoid a Babyface song here&there being played. anyway within the Smooth Jazz format Kirk Whalum does a pretty good on babyface's songs.these are some of his biggest hits.Face peaked between 87-97.Babyface shows up here on this tribute set.i still like the Whispers Tribute Album to Babyface a bit more,but this one is pretty good.I've got albums over the years where Kirk Whalum has played on things."
5,Kirk Does Babyface,"LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! Have listened eveyday since I got it. Strongly reccomend this CD. Put this CD on, a glass of wine, a warm fire, the recipe for perfect evening."
3,Smaller than 1st Mobilefan,"Already have 2 of the original Thermaltake USB MobileFan and thought this was just an upgrade, but it is much smaller than original (I did not look at spec close enough b4 buying). Original is standard 120mm x 120mm while the MobileFan II is 80mm x 80mm. Still no OFF position - just variable speed. Being smaller means that it's louder. Important specs (to me) are as follows:80x80x25mm350-400mA47.28 CFM17 dBA at 1300rpm31 dBA at 3000rpm"
5,Keeps our ps3 cool,"I originally got the idea for using this with my ps3 from another reviewer here on Amazon, so I can't take credit for the idea, but can let you know I also am using this unit to suck air from my entertainment center's cabinet to keep my playstation cool. We have an 18 month old who is very interested in electronics, and needless to say we don't want him to have access to our expensive playstation. Our ps3 is our go to media unit, giving us access to all our DVDs, netflix, Hulu, and more and having to keep the door open on our entertainment center with our son running around was less than ideal.The unit only comes on when the ps3 is running and we don't find the noise at full speed objectional at all. It was easily installed to the back of the entertainment center in about 10 minutes, and most of that was attaching the unit to the cabinet with screws. The cord is plenty long and convienently self contained. Packaging was also super easy to open, frustration free."
4,Works fine for my purpose,"Use these for cooling down my audio receiver and power amp. I am hoping that by using the fan, I can at least avoid heat issue and possible prolong the life of the receiver.About the fan itself, I only use it at less than half of the power. Else, I could hear the fan. However, using less than half power, it is sufficient to keep the receiver from getting too hot. So far only warm to touch or cold to touch, depending on the sound level.One fan is plugged to the TV's usb port and it will turn on the fan on the receiver each time I turn on the TV and use the receiver to play the digital audio via HDMI ARC feature.The other fan is plugged to the Blu-ray player so that each time I use it for playing music loud, it would cool down my Emotiva power amp.I am also glad that the cable itself is long enough to span 2+ feet.Although this fan works fine, I am taking one star away since anything more than 50% power causes noticeable noise in my setup."
5,cools my CPU,"When the cooling fan on my Toshiba quit working, the local Toshiba service center said the motherboard was bad and quoted $500 for a new one. I bought one of these Thermaltake fans, removed the fan from the cage, and used Velcro to attach it to the bottom of my computer over the fan outlet. The little sucker easily keeps my system under 45 degrees Centigrade. The computer isn't quite as convenient to use as before, but it sure has a new lease on life."
5,great little fan,"I've bought 2 so far!One for occasional use with my laptop one for our Wii or ps2. They work great, quiet, adjustable."
4,Great fan,Great little fan but a tad larger than I'd hoped for. I use it for my macbook pro that gets pretty hot when it's plugged in and charging. The one thing I don't like about the fan is the power connector. It's super short where the cord meets the housing and it's very difficult to unplug from the USB cable.
5,USB cooling fan.,I bought two of these. I'm shocked how well these little guys are working. I have them directed at the back of my Mac and they are keeping it nice and cool.
4,It works,This fan works as advertised. Its well constructed and a great solution to my small audio cabinet. The only con I have is that it's a lot noisier than I would like it to be. You have the option to turn the speed down till you can barely hear it but then it's not as affective. Overall I'm happy with the purchase and for the money it's hard to beat.
5,"Versatile, cabinet savior","I have a very small TV center niche in my living room wall. Below the TV I have a boxed cabinet that contains my receiver, my Wii, and my PS3. It gets hot in there. I bought this fan as I found the PS3 has USB ports on it. I cut a hole in the back of my cabinet and set the fan to blow across the top of my receiver. Each time that I have checked, I feel that the temperature coming off of the receiver has been cut down dramatically. The whole cabinet is not heating up as much as it once did. I think that this was a good buy."
5,Easily cooled my computer 10 degrees,"After reading skibot's review, I decided to get this fan. I also have my desktop tower located in the cabinet shelf of my desk. Now, this desk I got recently and didn't think how much hotter my computer would get inside this cabinet. I soon found that my computer would overheat and shut off if I had the cabinet door shut. So, I had to keep the cabinet door open to be able to use the computer, but it was still getting relatively hot, usually about 109F. Now with this tiny, quiet, incredibly inexpensive fan, my computer kept steady at about 99F. I tried then closing the cabinet door, and it seemed to be working, but eventually it did overheat. Still, great little fan! Maybe if I buy another, I'll have enough cooling power to leave the computer in the cabinet.Note: I am not the best judge of the fan's noise level since my desktop's fans, which I normally keep on high, are much louder."
4,"Works well, but no power switch","I use this to cool my PowerBook G4. The laptop is up on a simple stand, but it runs pretty hot; the CPU often runs up to 142+ degrees F, at which point the noisy internal fans turn on. With the little TT fan blowing across the keyboard area, the PowerBook seldom reaches 140 degrees, and the internal fans almost never kick in. The TT fan is nearly silent at its lowest levels, very quiet at the level I use (~halfway up), and not terribly loud even at its highest setting. It's definitely got a DIY-geeky look, but at least it's not geek-bling with pulsing LEDs or anything. My one big knock against it is its lack of an off switch. Seems like it would have been simple enough to have it click off when you turn it all the way down; as it is, I have to unplug it at the end of the day."
1,Two defectives,"I ordered one and within a few minutes of plugging into a USB port, it went to full speed and stayed there despite any change in knob setting. I returned it and promptly got a replacement. Same problem."
4,Thermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan,Very pleased with this fan. Its quiet and very powerful for its size. I only wish it had an on/off switch. You have to unplug it from the USB inlet to turn it off.
5,Perfect for Comcast DVRs in a cabinet.,"Two of my Comcast DVRs are mounted in enclosed cabinets. The DVR user guide specifically states that placement in an enclosed cabinet is not recommended, because it restricts airflow to the device. Comcast uses Motorola DVRs. The single USB port on rear of the DVR does not carry a signal but is hot (powered).I connected this fan to the USB port and the temperature in my cabinet dropped 10 degrees. The variable speed control allows you to find the sweet spot of ""fan noise to airflow"" ratio. I've ordered two more. One for my other cabinet, and one to manage rosin flux vapors on my electronics workbench.This fan is an inexpensive, elegant solution for multiple ventilation issues. Highly recommended."
5,Just What I Was Looking For,"My office desk is an old (pre-computer) banker's desk that I have modified with the help of a hole saw to make computer friendly. I am using one of the drawers for my external USB hard drives (1 TB and 500 GB LaCie drives) connected to a hub in the drawer. Those suckers can get hot and disk drives don't mix well with heat.The Thermaltake Mobile Fan II is a perfect solution to keeping cool air flowing. It's quiet, but powerful and my drives have surface temps 15-30 degrees *cooler* than they did before I bought the fan."
4,Great little USB fan,"Bought this to cool my Dish VIP 722 DVR and it was all that I expected. Just find an empty USB port, plug it in and set it up to suck the hot air out - easy as that. The unit is small, quite, and has an adjustable speed setting.Only down side I can think of is the USB cord that is provided is on an auto rewind hub. This is hard to use especially when you need to get thru small openings, but I got it to work OK.Overall - did the job for me. My 722 dropped 10 degrees immediatly which I hope will extend the DVR's life."
5,Nightmare,"These fans are wonderful, I now have 4 of them. I use them to cool my PS3, 360, HD DVR, and surround sound receiver all of which I have in an entertainment center. I also purchased a hub so I only have to use 1 usb port. Every piece of equipment I'm using one on stays nice and cool, even after playing games online for hours!"
5,Great solution for underdesk cooling,"I needed a fan to cool two CPUs under my desk, but I wanted it to turn off when I put the computers on standby. This little fan cools the entire area and is so quiet, it does not ""exist"". I'm very happy with this product."
5,AirFlow,"I have this item on my desk @ at work, I have no windows near me, so @ times it does get a little stuffy, but this little fan does a great job moving the immediate air around me. No noise, fan control."
4,Works well,"I needed something to keep my desk long cabinet cool since I have the PC tower, modem, router etc. The ones which work on 120 volts were loud and broke down w/in weeks. Since I never shut off the PC I needed something to be on 24/7. It works very well. I still have to keep the cabinet door open but it does cool the electronics well. Good value. Just wish it was just a little larger maybe by 1 inch more square."
5,I bought it for my ps3 slim!,"I bought this Because my first ps3 ""Metal Gear bundle"" die YLOD! I just put this on the back of my Ps3 sucking the hot air and yes, it does work! now my ps is more than 50% cooler and I'm thinking to put other one.Ps: turn on automatically when the ps3 is turned on!"
3,Louder than anything I've used.,"I have this pushing out hot air from the back of a custom built Gaming PC, and this ONE fan can drown out the 6 fans that are in my desktop! Yes it pushes A LOT of air, but its simply too noisy to use!"
5,fans to keep cool,"Purchased 2 fans run by the USB and put them into a hole I made in me desk. Takes out all of the heat from under the desk where the computer is stationed. Comes on only when the computer is on, GREAT."
4,Cool looking fan that I wish turned off,"This is a cool looking fan with a nice retractable cord. It has a little analog knob on it that lets you control the speed... but it doesn't click to an off position. It'd be great if you could turn this fan off without unplugging it.It also has a tendency to skate across my desk in full speed, but putting it against something or on a rougher surface solves this. Some rubber grips on the metal stand would be awesome.Either way, I really like this fan. It keeps a slight breeze going at my desk and looks great."
5,A+ Awsome fan!!,I bought this fan for my Xbox 360. It is nice!!!! it keeps it cool hours on end. One delta....on/off switch. ahhhhh but its a nice fan!
5,Exactly what I needed,This fan is exactly what I was looking for. The ingenuity of wiring this fan to do its job is fantastic.
4,Does the job for me...........,"I have the small one and I like it so well that I bought the big (120mm) for another application. I could have built my own from some of the case fans that I had laying around, but they would not have looked as good as this setup."
5,Works Great,"I have a PC inside a desk cabinet which was having some overheating issues. I bought this to help vent hot air from the cabinet and improve airflow in a closed space. While this fan is small, it actually moves quite a bit of air. I have it positioned over a vent hole in the bottom of the desk and it keeps the cabinet at a very reasonable temp. I definitely recommend this as a cheap alternative for ventilating small spaces for electronics. It's been working for over two years now with no isssues. A great little fan."
5,Thermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan,"I already have a couple of these fans that have been in service for about 1.5 years now. Except on the very highest setting, they are very quiet. I actually have to look at the blades to see if they are spinning. I use them to provide extra cooling for HD enclosures, and they're great for work because they aren't noisy and, they provide a slight breeze without blowing everything off my desk. Today's computer systems have USB ports just about everywhere (front, back, monitors), so you shouldn't have much of a problem finding a place to plug it in."
2,very loud,I read the reviews saying this was a quiet fan. But it's not. It's very loud unless you turn the speed down to the lowest (or almost lowest) speed.
5,Very handy addition,Used to blow across the keyboard of a MacBook which gets really warm. Very handy and the adjustability of the fan speed is terrific. Probably going to get a couple of more.
5,Review for Thermaltake Fan II USB,This fan is so good that in my humble opinion it could easily replace any other fan for laptops you could mention.Buy two and better.
4,Quite and strong - bought several,"Completely as advertised, but more durable and quieter than expected.I bought several, and placed the extras on my office and home work desks.Mainly purchased to ventilate my desktop tower which sits inside a home desk compartment; there was a cable access hole that I placed the fan into ... now I can run my desktop without keeping the compartment door open for cooling."
3,Buyers remorse....,"This is a great product, however when I tried to use it in a case to cool it off, it was very loud. Apparently it gives off a slight hum, but when placed in a box, it is amplified.Next time I will buy the 120mm version.I still use it to cool my laptop and it works great!"
4,Great little fan!,"I was looking for a little fan to put in a cracked window and pull in some night air, this did the trick. I've started using it on my desk and when soldering as well, much handier than I ever anticipated."
4,Does the job,"Bought this to keep my Dell Studio Slim cool in my computer desk. Fan is kinda loud at the higher speeds, but it does what I need it to do---gets the hot air out of the way. Have had it for approx.4 months--no issues."
5,Great item,This item is really good. Has a nice price and works great. This has a great air flow and keep my gaming laptop cooled while im playing for hours!! Worth every cent. Highly recomended.
4,Lo que necesitaba,"Practico y fácil de instalar y usar, realmente lo que necesitaba, en mi caso para usar como FAN para el Xbox 360, este lo coloque por los laterales para que impulsara el aire en el interior y cambié los coolers que trae el xbox por unos mejores, como resultado la temperatura se mantiene estable, el único detalle y por el cual no le di 5 estrellas es porque no trae un switch para prenderlo y apagarlo, se activa inmediatamente al conectarlo al USB y para detenerlo debes desconectarlo del puerto."
1,Loud!,"These fans are much too loud. I have them mounted on the back of my FW900 CRT and even on the lowest setting 4 feet from my ears they are really loud. You need a larger, slower spinning fan to lessen noise."
1,VERY TOXIC PLASTIC USED,"This is a neat little fan and does work, but I had to throw it out, due to the fact that the insidious toxic plastic vapors emitted from it immediately gave me headaches that lasted for hours, every time I went near it.I don't know if it is the fire-retardant, the BPA, plasticizers, the XYZ, or whatever. I am not a chemist. This offending vapor is in many fans and electronics (but certainly not all) and more in the past than it is in the newer stuff, since Europe impose consumer protection restrictions on toxic additives.I did not return it, but threw away the fan, and kept the stand, USB chord, and variable speed switch. I sometimes feel I should have returned it.But if you are the kind of person that craves that new-car smell, you might not have a problem with this fan, but I would not recommend it to cancer patients, Alzheimer's patients, or allergic people, MCS sufferers, etc."
3,Good office fan,"Pros - Quiet, variable speed control, extended USB cable, portable and inexpensiveCons - Limited fan tilt angel & height adjustments."
4,Looks good but,I got this so I can cool down my notebook in a hot room. I made a few fan my self with silent pc fan and some old ac charger plugs from old cell phone. (plug in to the receiver so each time receiver is turn on the fan is auto on)Anyway got this one so it can work with USB.The goodIt got speed controlWork with USB so your notebook is on it turns onThe badThe cable box for USB is kinda in the wayFan stand start to shake and make sound when is turn up all the way.A little over price...
4,Stylish and Efficient Mobile Cooling,"I ordered 2 of these things, only one arrived in working condition... seems to be common with this product. HmmmRegardless, the working one is decent. I've got it in my stereo cabinet next to the ps3. Can be a little loud at full blast but 3/4 power cycles the air pretty well, and the whole compartment feels much cooler now. Plus it just looks sick, and turns off/on with the usb power. For this price, you cant beat it. I'll likely order more. Awesome purchase."
5,Great Little Fan,"I've used several laptop cooling pads and I'm not very impressed. Yes, they are better than nothing but the laptop still runs quite warm.I bought this fan because it's small and runs off the power from a USB port. I bent the frame on the fan a bit so the air from the fan will blow under the laptop. I find the laptop stays quite cool now even when running the CPU at 100 percent running Seti@home software.I've run the fan for about 3 weeks now and never shut it off. I do turn it to the lowest setting however at night. Not a problem. Still runs quiet. I'd recommend it."
5,Love this fan,"My work-given laptop is tiny (Dell Latitude d420) and overheats so badly you can fry an egg on it. Because of the nature of my work, it stays on day and night, and I have a cooling station with 3 (three!) fans underneath it which barely help at all. I have placed this fan at an angle, aiming it directly at the overheating HD, and it's been cool as an icicle ever since. It's quiet, doesn't make my hands cold, it's a perfect size for my desk and a perfect addition to my workstation. Yes, it has no turn-off switch, but who needs it when you can just unplug the device."
2,Loud & Weak!,"the fan makes noise a minimum speed and really loud at max speed. If it blows out a lot of air, then it's acceptable; however, I hardly feel any air from 13"" away. It's too noisy to be comfortable!"
3,Its a fan !,"Its a fan, and a bit noisy (at high speed -dont know why you will use this fan if you are using at lowest speed) if that bothers you"
5,Very useful,"I was going to build something like this before it occurred to me to look for it here. It's just what it looks like: A standard case fan with a rheostat knob, a usb power adapter, and a bit of wire for a stand. The fan is very quiet, almost silent at a moderate speed while still moving a nice amount of air. Overall it's well-made, not cheap or cheesy. The retractable USB cable is a nice bonus.I use it next to a Macbook Pro. I turn it on when I'm doing resource-intensive things like video rendering, and it can make a 5-10 degree (C) difference in the measured temps of the laptop.And here's a bonus use: When hanging up my camelbak bladder for drying, I set this fan right in front of the filler opening, and it dries really fast! :)"
4,Great little fan,"Perfect solution for spots where you need just a bit of airflow to keep things running cooler. There's a larger size from this same company, so if you need serious airflow, go with the larger one. This smaller one was just right for me, but really doesn't move all that much air - 'just enough...'"
2,2 design flaws,"This should have been a nifty little gadget, but two rather obtuse design flaws ruin it. First, there is no Off switch. There is a rheostat, but no way to turn the device off. So when I don't want to use the fan I have to unplug the USB? I can only shake my head at this.Secondly, the wires come off the top of the unit. Consequently you have an ugly display on your desktop. The fan looks like it can be repositioned, but this is ridiculous.The fan itself seems fine, though I do get some whine reverberating on my table top even at low speed.Two bone-headed design flaws that did not have to be ruin what this device could have been. I'm really surprised at Thermaltake."
3,"This fan works, but ...","This fan works, but the ""Thermaltake Mobile Fan 12 External USB Cooling Fan 12CM AF0007"" costs just a few dollars more and is quieter, stronger, little bit bigger. I would not buy this fan again only because the Mobile Fan 12 is so much better."
3,1 out of 2 is silent =),"Not much I can say that's new material here, but I am mostly happy with the 2 little fans I ordered. The only weird thing is they both generate different levels of noise. On the same knob setting one fan is virtually silent while the other is... not. I didn't expect whisper quiet or anything but at least a nice steady sound. This one is intermittent in its sound. Still, if you've got some music or a game going you don't even hear it. I was hopeful these would shut themselves off when I put my PC to sleep. They don't unless I power it down."
4,Well thought out and effective,This product was exactly what was needed to cool off my home theatre system. The combination of features such as variable speed and retractable power cord made for a very handy package.
5,Xbox 360,"I use it on my Xbox360,i put two on the side intake and one in the back blowing out.My Box is running real cool. A must have."
4,works good for ps3 slim,"The fan works great, I have two of them for my ps3 slim. When they are turned on high they make a humm noise which when playing a game I don't mind if I am watching a blu ray I just turn the fan speed down. It isn't hard to drown out the humm noise the retractable cable is nice and over all great product good price and after reading reviews for ps3 coolers just buy these you can choose where to put them."
3,Not the best collection,"One of my All-Time Favorites is ""Pride and Prejudice"" (This version Only). The collection wasn't great, though. ""Little Women"" is pretty good; but, I didn't really care at all for the other two."
3,Two out of four worth watching...,"I don't understand why they thought putting depressing messes like Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary with heart warming inspirations like Pride and Prejudice, and Little Women would be a good idea. Just because they are about women?! Inexplicable. But, for the price you can't really complain."
5,Little Women,I bought this set of Classic Films mainly to watch Little Women with June Allison. I still haven't watched the other 3 movies. So I rated Little Women with 5 stars. Wonderful Christmas Classic.
1,Disappointing.....,"Actually, I didnt even get that far into the film to see if it is decent or not.The quality of this DVD is absolutely THE WORST Ive encountered.It was so bad I couldnt even watch it because the quality of the copied print was so horrible....too bad...the costuming at least looked fun!If anyone ever comes up with a decent print Id like to watch it....."
5,Best Swan Lake I've ever watched.,The dancers are very charming and everything with this show is great!
2,Did not work for me.,"I have needed a prostate supplement for at least 20 years. Given the positive reviews and a lower price than the Beta Sitosterol based supplement I had been using, I decided to give it a try. After about 3 weeks of use, I went back to my former supplement. I had gone from 0-1 trips to the bathroom at night to an average of three. Flow was substantially reduced as well. One week back on my old supplement, and I now sleep through the night, or one trip at worst.Given that we are all different, this product may work very well for some people, but not for me. It is cheaper than most I have tried."
1,Waste of money,"Didn’t notice a difference, ended up just biting the bullet and seeing a doctor and got a prescription for a real medication."
2,Disposable microwave,"My first microwave lasted for twenty-one years and was actually still working (just big and ugly) when I traded it for a Kenmore. The Kenmore looks nice, worked well, and then died yesterday - - giving it a lifespan of two years. Considering the trouble I have had with my new Kenmore washing machine - that's it. I won't be buying Kenmore products again."
2,Died in 16 Months,"This microwave worked well enough for what I did with it, which was mostly just reheating, boiling water, and making popcorn. It died yesterday after 16 months of moderate use (3-4 times per day for a couple minutes). The fan and light still come on, but nothing gets warmer now (I did check the power and tried a few tests with different settings). I expect appliances to last longer."
2,Worked for exactly 1 year 1 month...to the day!,"This microwave worked great for one year and one month. The warranty is only good for one year. Go figure! It was very disappointing as we've had Kenmore microwaves all along. It sounds like it is working but nothing gets heated. We will be buying a new microwave now, VERY reluctantly. :("
2,DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE,"I've had this microwave for 2yrs and a few months. Just the other day I wanted to heat up some food. The normal tinkering with the keypad and start, then a violent buzz followed by a power trip that turned off the all the power in the kitchen. I tried it on various outlets of the house to see if the the same problem would happen. I even ran an extension cord from my garage just to see what would happen and the microwave would do the same thing with the violent buzzing then turn itself off. I really loved this microwave when it worked.not great for the long haul."
4,"Fresh, Not Cheap","These seeds tasted fresh, and had an expiration date 11 months out. However, even with a promotion the price wasn't that great (4 dollars more expensive than the salted variety?!); and ""and/or cottonseed oil"" doesn't belong in sunflower seeds."
1,Computer backpack,Seemed like a nice quality product when I received it - gave it as a gift to my son. It ripped inside rather quickly. Don't recommend it.
5,# 16 of 24,"This one was just as good as all the story's that came before it. Everyone man, women or young adult would enjoy this series. Every book is awesome. New characters, plus the ones the reader has been following!"
5,Good intro to the Iron Kingdoms.,"This book includes info on the Iron Kingdoms, the races (including game info), changes to the base classes, and takes a look at some of the firearms, grenades, and mechanical stuff you'll find in the IK.Note that no info is included on the new classes (arcane mechanik, et. al.) or prestige classes (warcaster and such).Given that the Character's Guide is out of print and ridiculously high in cost, anyone looking for a personal copy of info needed to roll up a character should consider this book.The included map of Immoren is a plus."
2,Do they make one for dudes?,"I guess this shirt features some beautiful artwork, but do they make a men's version? I'm thinking like ""The Keymaster"" or something a little less Georgia O'Keeffe and a little more Conan the Destroyer. I want a shirt that's masculine, but not quite as powerful as a Breakthrough Wolf to round out my semi-casual wardrobe and to be honest the last thing I want is some purple sniz fairy bursting out of my chest like a baby alien."
1,YET ANOTHER EPIC FAIL,I ordered tulips for my wife because they are her favorite flower.Instead of the 30 Multicolored tulips I ordered she receives a dozen roses. REALLY dont you think if I wanted to order a dozen roses I would have done that.Whats next AMAZON and Pro Flowers?!?!? Maybe you will substitute a flaming bag of dog excrement for my next order.So far today 2 of my three orders from you have been nothing like what I ordered. If I wanted a surprise package or a mystery gift I would have ordered that.I am disgusted with this shopping experience.EPIC FAIL!!!
2,Limited Mac Support,I bought this card for its mac support to find out that the company will not be making Leopard drivers.
3,Nayarit birding,"This book covers Nayarita, MX coastline. Its fairly dated but still relevant. Some pictures although I was hoping for more. Focuses on trails & towns where you can spot specific species."
2,This book had nothing to do with being a mentor,"I found this book to be dull, pretentious, and without any merit. Growing up in the south must have been difficult, but I fail to see what this memoir has to do with anything other than the author showing off his checkered past and large vocabulary.Yawn"
4,Lourdes with a twist,"Lourdes Robles together with Yolandita Monge and Ednita Nazario is my favorite pop/ballad artist from Puerto Rico. I recommend all three. In ""Cielo de Acuarela"" Lourdes tries with great sucess various latin rhythms mainly those with ""sabor boricua""- rhythms of Puerto Rico. Although it's not what her albums are usually about, for instance instead of the usual romantic beautiful ballad she sings enchanting boleros and instead of the occasional pop song she brings better rooted rhythms that represent Puerto Rico's music culture, ""Cielo de Acuarela"" thriumphs as a very good pop/tropical album."
5,Greatly Improved Edition,"I am gladly surprised to see how the author has taken the effort, not just to make a routine revision of the classic book, but to write a completely different book. Non interesting material has been removed, while new up-to-date topics have been added (for instance Charge Pump PLL), based on the own author research, and other published papers.The approach of some classic analysis has also changed. In particular the approach to the so called Loop Filter as a controller and not as a filter.In summary, a very valuable addition to PLL literature, worth to buy even by readers that own previous editions."
5,Great Price,Great Price on this Item. Lowest price i have seen anywhere.usually are 2-3 dollars higher in price at other locations.
3,It's ok,This is very watered down but it does well in getting the job done. If you are looking at these it's a good brand but I would recommend spending a little more and getting one that is higher concentrated.
1,Double Standard Proved Again!,"It is amazing that it is accepted by publishers, the media and many readers to write a book about destroying an entire nation of people, as long as they are German. Yet, if such a book was written about Jews, it would be banned by publishers, attacked by the media and scorned by readers. All books of hate are disgusting! However, it is far worse when such thinking is the exclusive right of some and the crimes of another. I will keep this book available to show anyone how badly our society treats the German people."
1,What's With Etzer?,"This is a despicable, evil book, obviously. Etzer's review below is even more disturbing; perhaps he can see an exorcist, or be forced to read books by decent, righteous Jews."
5,Do you believe in absolute truth? I don't...,"I loved to read this book. After many years studying the World War II, after reading many authors who would just say the very same thing, I happened to come across it.This book was written a long time before the nazis officilised the anti-semitism in germany. Its basic message is: GERMANY MUST DISAPPEAR FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. Literally, not metaphoricaly!It may seem to you that this book was an isolated event, but it wasn't. Anti-german feelings among the jews were so widespread during that time, that I can understand what went on over there. (...)READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Ridiculous anti-german diatribe.,"I read some parts of this bad book available(free)on internet.It was writen by an american jew in 1940.Theodore Kaufmann some years before to write this bad book, was a famous eugenist and was talking ridiculous diatribes against colored people, miscigenation, etc.The core idea of this bad book is that the germans were a people genetically, senteced to be ever bad murders.Then the solution was an eugenical sterilization, exterminating all German's population, in some years.Bad book, after all.Ironically the anti-semits are using this book now against the jews..."
2,Very disappointing...,"I was excited to order this product because of all the positive reviews. However, I was quickly disappointed. My biggest complaint is that it is clearly written for domestic issues. So if your ADD challenges are having to do with doing the laundry, paying your bills, reducing clutter in your closets or rooms, or planning/making your meals, this may be a good book for you. But if your issues are of a professional or work nature, you will be terribly disappointed, as I was. ""Play loud music"" is a recommendation that clearly isn't going to work at the office. ""Routines for laundry and household cleaning"" and ""Routines for general housecleaning"" are typical sections, as more examples.Getting help from ""friends and family,"" which is one of the main solutions, isn't going to work at the office either. I got very little out of this book and felt I wasted my money."
5,"A book for anyone overwhelmed with how to put organization into their lives, whether they have ADD or not!!",Whether or not you have ADD or ADHD this book will help. A practical easy read that you can start implementing as soon as you start reading. If you have been frustrated and discouraged with other books that are over detailed and overwhelming- this book will lift your spirit with hope. If you had to choose one book to organize your life- This is it!!!
3,"Not a CD playable CD, so, haven't listened to it...","This is not a CD that plays on a CD player, so, haven't been able to listen to it. My computer isn't working that way, so, someday will get it downloaded to an MP3 player. Disappointed that couldn't play on a CD player. I gave it three stars, simply because I hope it will be useful information even though the format wasn't immediately user friendly. The producers didn't consider their target audience... Requires several steps, therefore, won't happen anytime soon."
2,Not that impressive or helpful,Too many books read like the author just copied articles on a subject and crammed them into a so-called book. This was one of those. There just wasn't any helpful information in it and I thought it was a waste of money.
1,THIS BOOK WORKS!,"This book offers a wealth of engaging,concrete,simplified step by step strategies to handle the hurdles.I originally bought it in hopes of helping my 11 yr old son.I was amazed to learn that I used several of the strategies years ago when I taught school! I didn't realize that other people don't have to play music while they declutter, or sprint through something before they become distracted.Nor did I realize how so ADD I am , until I began seeing myself on every page. The authors definately set you up to succeed. They offer clear succinct techniques,fun ways to focus,and a totally different approach of working with the strenths of your ADD."
2,Advertisement for professional services,"I just started reading the book, but found advertisement for professional services on almost every chapter: ""get help from professionals"" in chapter three, four, five, six, seven... Why would I need a book to tell me that you can use some ideas in the book but better hire a professional and give him this book to follow with you. Get help here or there: ask friends or family. C'mon it is a book to organize yourself, not to delegate tasks to somebody else..."
1,Obvious and pointless,"This book-long advertisement for ""professional organizers"" is full of directives that I figured out on my own years ago."
2,ADD friendly ways to organize your life,very good advises for adults with ADD. I also have a child with ADD and I can use these ideas with him too.
1,Don't waste your money,"If you have true ADD, you may never get around reading a book with 250 pages. People with ADD have short attention span, mostly not capable of sitting down and read long books. If you have ADD the chances are you will buy this book read a few pages then leave it on the bookshelf."
5,Break-through book for ADD'ers,"Easy to read, actually fun, explains why conventional time management and organization techniques don't work with ADHD and what to do about it. Contains a slew of practical and creative strategies for adults with ADD to put life in order and keep it there! Easy to tailor to your own specific challenges."
4,Helpful book,"Downloaded for my Kindle. If only I could get my ADD-driven self organized, I would have time to finish reading it and write a full recommendation...The first couple of chapters were helpful, though. Liked the bit on how motivation drives memory - already shared that with a friend. The chapters are chopped up into ADD-friendly bits too, so clearly the authors understand their audience.Recommended."
4,Recognizing patterns of behaviour + practical ways to change them,"After trying many 'get organized' books without much success (but acquiring a nifty assortment of filing bins/ folders/ labels/ dust-collectors in the process), and having my (very orderly-minded) mother despair of persuading me to use budget books or create tidy files, I finally found a book that addresses all the ways I'm disorganized in my life. The chapter on how an ADD-challenged person's financial systems can fall apart if any other part of their life spins out of control really hit home, and I'm going to spend January working out ways to implement the authors' suggestions. The only other volume that helped me, especially re: my business life, was ""Organizing for the Creative Person: Right-Brain Styles for Conquering Clutter, Mastering Time, and Reaching Your Goals,"" by Dorothy Lehmkuhl and Dolores Cotter Lamping. I'd recommend them both."
5,ADD-Friendly Ways to Organize Your Life,"I don't do well with lists. In this book I finally found actual strategies that work for me... written in a very ""ADD-friendly"" way."
5,Finally some practical ideas,"I'm so glad to have found this book! Most of the others I have read talk about ADD and how it affects your life in general, rather than giving very specific suggestions of how to cope with it. This book is full of things you can do in the real world to cope with ADD. I highly recommend it."
3,Not as ADD as I thought I was,"Maybe I'm a Compulsive instead, seeing that I sat down and read the book in one gulp. For someone with a mild case of distractability, there were several very useful ideas, some of which I already do to help myself stay focused. (Stubby lists, for example) I also liked ""Body Double"".The organization of the book was reliable--a good thing.Probably very helpful for someone who is genuinely determined work on their ADD."
4,Easy to assimilate-very helpful!,Certainly described the ADD issues in a way that I could relate to and then what to do work with them. So many of these type of books go indepth into theory without any supportive suggestions. Very helpful- would recommend!
3,Still working my way through,"What can I say ... the writing is choppy enough that I can't seem to get into hyper-focus mode, but the tips are useful enough to make continued (sporadic) efforts worthwhile.I DO take exception to the idea of hiring a whole slew of professionals to help get organized. If I am going to have to pay a professional home organizer to make sense of my life, I might as well pay a maid to come in once a week. My wife would probably like that. ;-)But I don't want someone else to make sense of my life ... -I- want to make sense of it.Ms Kolberg lives in a world of 'coach this', 'coach that' that just generally doesn't exist independently of a large income and a large city. And, for that, her book falls far short of what it could have been."
3,Beautiful pictures,"A beautiful display of unbelievable work that few of us would even attempt. Only the basics on ""how to"". But maybe that's all there is to it; hours and hours of tedium."
1,A real stinker!,"This is without doubt the worst book about Notre Dame football I have ever tried to read. My wife, who is not a college football crazy, knows more than this author about ND football. This book should be read by any young child trying to get an elementary grasp on the golden dome game and should not be read by anyone else. It certainly cannot be meant to be read by any true Irish fan! If you had a rating of 0 stars available, I would have assigned it to this total waste of time read."
2,"Disappointing! If they are bad girls, they are not very bad. .","If you are looking for a hard core adult movie, this is not the one, despite it being labeled an ""uncensored"" movie. The movie starts with filming of some landmarks of Budapest, the City. That part is good. It then films the scene at a Budapest Disco. The remaining movie is about two very sexy, attractive young Budapest women, about 19 to 21, who are shown separately in a room by themselves on a bed. For about 25 to 30 minutes each, the women take off their clothes and then pleasures themselves. The producer also has out three other movies of bad girls of the World from Europe. These movies, if made right, could be excellent adult entertainment, but without giving the viewers what they really want to see, they are nothing but a tease. Don't waste your money if you want real adult entertainment."
2,Needs improvement,I got this player to play mp3's because i go on long road trips. It works if you don't search through songs. I tried multiple times to search and it would freeze like a computer. I had to take out the batteries to make it stop. And sometimes when you are just listening it will jump to the beggining of the next song and go back to where it was playing. It's just a little clip but you can notice it very clearly (it's annoying). It has some problems playing mp3's and it has some glitches like freezing sometimes when playing and the lens is loud. The headphones hurt after a while but they have good quality. Battery life could be longer. If you just need an mp3 player there is probably a better one somewhere. I don't recommend buying this. I wasn't pleased with it's quality. Te chrome around the volume looks very cheap. If you don't care about the quality and don't mind the skips back and fourth you can buy this. I returned it.
2,Maybe mine is defective,This WAS a nice cd player. I got mine with a very handy car kit. The problems started soon after though. It will not read most of my MP3 cds that other players will read. It also tends to lock up and creates a buzzing sound. Overall I am NOT impressed and I am looking to a different brand for a replacement!
4,For what it's worth - my opinion,My nephew purchased a RCA RP2450 and I was so impressed with the sound that I bought my own. I have had this player for approximently six months now and all in all I am happy with it. It has very good volume with decent bass and three different bass boost levels. I have made 2 CD's with about 200 songs on each at all different bit rates and out of all those songs it has only failed to read six. It has yet to skip even once (hard to believe but true) - even in the car which has really impressed me. Neither my nephew or I have had any trouble with our players and we have both had them for about six months.The only con is that it doesn't come with an AC adaptor - although usually if I am using this unit I am on the go. I do wish that I would have done a little more research on portable MP3 players before I bought this one. ... It would have been nice to have had FM radio to go along with the CD player capabilities. ...
2,RCA Model RP 2450C,"Just purchased the RCA CD/MP3 Model RP 2450C unit primarily for playing my MP3 files burned to a CD-R @ 128kbps. The unit can not play a single song without skipping even when laying flat on a table with ESPX turned on. However, I have been able to determine a slight pattern. Every song skips at about 12 seconds then at 1:09 etc... Seems to be relatively consistent. The CD-R's are clean and play fine on other players. Very disappointed."
5,Great product-- used for our wedding cake,"I bought 2 sets for our 6 layered cheesecake wedding cake. No leaking, minimal sticking. Everything seemed to bake evenly. Construction seems solid. Much better deal than buying different sizes separately!"
3,pattylan,"Feeling the kingdom within generates from silence, honoring empty space. Just being still as a plant in total acceptance of all that is. TAO of contemplation awakens the experience of this feeling of oneness with poems. How to allow the gifts of this consciousness are explained."
3,Nice ring,"I like this ring and it arrived quickly and fits perfectly. However, some of the silver area around the stones has some kind of black residue on it. I tried cleaning it with silver polish cleaner but it would not remove it. This makes me wonder about the quality of the metal."
4,Worth reading to hear the point of view of an involved witness,"From glory to disgrace is the title of the book written by an important witness : the General President Prosper Avril for 2 years not long after the departure of Baby Doc.I am surprised that no Haitian politician has decided to submit a comment here .I must say I am quite surprised , positively, by the intellectual analysis coming from an ex member of the Haitian Army, generally famous mostly for not being writers or analysts.The author shows he is conscious of Haitian history , has read some of the important historians of the Haitian republic.Of course, the author present his own point of view and clearly declares it at the beginning of the book; nevertheless, the book should be recommended for reading by all , Haitians and foreigners concerned about the destiny of this Black Republic and of its continued survival for the years to come."
3,Confusing.,"It is an agency within the department relating to policing human relations between other planets. When travelers accidentially get arrested or go missing on other planets and political pressure cannot get them back, this agency does whatever it takes to get them off planet. No one is to ever know they exist, allowing the D.I.R. to deny involvement in ant treaty breaking. If you think this review is confusing, read the book. The story starts in the middle with a little plot and end in the middle only solving a small part of a very large picture. Entertaining, but leaves a lot of loose ends."
3,Haunting questions,"Merleau-Ponty's The Structure of Behavior is a dense text book on clinical biology. One has to be astonished at the range of his scholarship having read his books on other subjects. By ""behavior"" he is mostly talking about animal behavior. He has only thrown in one or two references to inauthentic human behavior. I see Merleau-Ponty as a thinker who fought hard for the notion that human beings are not merely mechanical objects. It doesn't quite come across here. If we are going to study stimulus reaction tell us why carnival rides grab our erogenous zones or how young boys can be physically aroused around females before they know the facts of life. The book left me with other troubling thoughts. Should what the Nazis learned in their clincal studies be off limits? Where are the moral limits to research?"
2,Terrible if that,Very very weak video overall. No real life interviews of the band or concerts? What is this video about? A few people give their opinions of Dave Grohl and the band. No point and a waste of time. Yuck..... Oh wait...Dave had side jobs...So do most people.
4,Very Happy for the price.,"Once these are put together they are pretty sturdy. They moved my 700 snowmobile around a little easier then the steerable wheels that I have.Even with shipping, these were still quite a bit cheaper than any wheels at the dealer."
5,"Wynken, Blynken and Nod","This was one of my children's favorite nursery rhymes when they were little...we knew it by heart! When my first grandchild was born three years ago I couldn't find the book that I thought we had saved and had no luck tracking it down anywhere. Thank you so much, Amazon!! This is the book!"
2,Pretty much what you'd expect from a large balloon...,"First off, you need to have a helium tank for this thing to be of any use.Once you have it filled with helium, it's exactly as useful as you would expect an oversized balloon that is slightly weighted to keep it from floating completely away to be... fun for a little kid for maybe an hour, and then a big bulky thing that gets in the way and doesn't fit conveniently on any sort of shelf thereafter."
2,"""All in One CAPM Exam Guide"" a Bust",This is a good overall Project Management book - but it is not a good CAPM Exam guide. I scored 93% on the chapter tests in the book and failed the CAPM test. There was only about 10% of the information from the book on the actual exam. Buyer beware.
2,"Good supplemental reading, but rely on the PMBOK!","This book provided some good information and presented some of the stodgy content of the PMBOK in a matter-of-fact approach. I would not rely on this book, however, as it delves into a lot of material not covered on the exam. If you get caught up in the complex formulas in the CAPM guide, you are likely to miss the key 4 or 5 formulas that the CAPM exam actually covers. I passed the exam, although I relied principally on the PMBOK. For an entry-level exam such as the CAPM, the PMBOK is really all you need. For those with little to no PM experience, a couple of supplemental readings such as this one may be helpful. Good luck!"
3,"Not perfect, but still a valuable source of information to prepare for the CAPM exam","This book presents the information from the official PMBok in an easy to understand way. The real life examples in this book make it easier to understand the theory.However, I found that this book is lacking a clear in-chapter structure. This book contains several spelling mistakes and the test software delivered with this book contains several serious content errors."
2,Largely forgettable soundscapes,"Clearly written as a dramatic accompaniment, as stand-alone music (ie. as opposed to background music) this Arild Anderson disc just doesn't cut it. For the most part (& especially as evidenced by the first 5 tracks) it is entirely predictable & ponderous with long, drawn-out musical soundscapes with over-use of bass (surprise, surprise!) & drum loops & other technology. The only highlights worthy of note are tracks 9 (which itself takes ages to get going but ultimately features beautifully haunting trumpet work by Arve Henriksen) & 13 plus the vocals of Savina Yannatou (on 6 tracks in total) - 2.5 stars."
5,Heavy duty and functional,"Just what I expected, it is pretty heavy though and not hollow. So don't make the mistake of taking the weight off while this bar is attached or you're in for a surprise."
4,NOT AS SHOWN,"Four stars because it's a great bar, one star off because it's not the bar that's shown in the ad. The bar advertised does not have balls on the ends, but the one you get does. I hate these balls because they break and then you're left with a bar with a threaded hole in the end. They should advertise it correctly."
4,Solid Bar,"Just received this bar in the mail yesterday. Used it this morning for the first time. Nothing much to say about it other than it is a solid lat bar, good knurling and it seems to do the job as expected. Mine came with the rubber knobs on the ends which at first I was not too thrilled about, but it may be beneficial if I ever turn and bump my head into it while hanging. Overall a good purchase for $28 bucks and free shipping! If you are looking for a basic wide solid lat bar then you will not be dissappointed with your purchase of this bar."
1,Obsolete,"On the box it states that this game works with Windows 95/98, not XP as it is stated in the Amazon description. I tried installing it on Vista, and it won't even install. The game installed on Windows XP, but it runs with many bugs, hang ups, very slow, and it is almost impossible to exit this game (you need to do it through killing it from Task Manager.) Also we found Word Munchers to be very simplistic and boring. All it does is offer different lists of words from which you are supposed to pick words matching the description: nouns, verbs or vehicles, depending on the game category."
1,boring,boring could not get into it. fell asleep blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah b
5,Excellent presentation of real life in the coalfields of WV,"This book is great reading for anyone that enjoys real life situations. It is particularly enjoyable and enterataining for people who can relate to the pressue of two dissimiliar parents who want different things for their siblings. For anyone with a knowledge of coal or of the coalfields of southern West Virginia it is a ""must read"". I guarantee if you have any interest in coal or the coalfields you will not put this book down until you have finished it. Even after completion you will reflect on the emotions it will bring back from your own experiences."
5,ONE OF THE BEST,A terrific treat for readers of all ages. I was spellbound with the magnificent imagery and beautiful storytelling of Hickam. The characters were so vivid and real and the noble quest of the Rocket Boys will stay in my memory for many years. I don't think anyone will be disappointed in this book.
5,5 stars are not enough!,Do I have to say more about my real favorite novel? Homer H. Hickam Jr has an incredible gift in portraying stories!
5,"A book for everyone All I can say is great, great work","This boook will make you laugh,and cry and you will never loose interest in it. When I began to read I couldn't lay it down. I think that Homer did a great job. He also is proof that I a McDowell Countian can go anywhere in life if I work hard and set my mind to it!!"
2,"A fun up-beat read, but nothing fabulous","I give this book two stars mostly based on personal taste. It is a fun read, and has an up-beat tone that leaves you feeling pretty good about people and the world. Unfortunately, though, there just isn't much to it. The scenery, characters and story telling are a banal mix of Hickham's strung-together memories and a big rusty can of Americana. There isn't anything very ambitious or exciting about it; Rocket Boys is simple, straight-forward, and decently entertaining. If it were a food, it would be chicken soup. A hearty, unimaginative, comforting bowl of chicken soup."
1,It was not what I thought I ordered,"I chose to buy from this vendor because the product shown was the original cover art and size. WHAT I GOT was a SMALLER hardcover book with completely different book cover. I am assuming a different edition. This may not sound important, but the christmas gift was for someone who knows of the book, loved the cover art and it's just not going to look like what they are expecting. I would return it but I need a christmas gift.Why is it so hard to put up an accurate picture of what they are selling.Do not buy."
3,school project,Was purchased due to a requirement by my childs school. He has informed me it is a good book.
5,A great book,"When I finished this book, I did not close it, I did not put it down. I turned back to page 1 and started reading it again.The time with Homer and his friends was so enjoyable that I was not ready to leave."
4,Great Book,The book Rocket Boys was a very exciting and wonderful book. It can bring a tear to your eye. It is a true story about a young boy named Homer H. Hickam Jr. Who has higher hopes and dreams then just working in a coal mine. He lives in a small town in West Virginia. He becomes interested in rockets when he sees one soaring through the night sky. He dreams of one day building a rocket and sending it roaring through the sky. For a chance at leaving and going off to college he enters a science fair. Sonny's father doesn't believe in him and wants so bad to prove to his father that there are better things out there for him then mining.Hopefully he will be able to go off to college and find a wonderful job. But the only way you can find out how this story ends is if you read it. This is an inspiring book. This is a book that you won't be able to put down. Rocket Boys is one of the best books I have read and I hope everyone who reads it will enjoy it as much as I did.
2,Tells the tale of a dreamer & a bygone era of innocence-so??,"Although the reviews have been great I just couldn't get excited over Homer Hickam Jr.'s recap of his rocket-blasting days. I found myself asking, ""Who cares whether they fly or not?"". If you're a rocket fanatic then you'll like it...Otherwise? Nah! Also to the author: You've really gotta get over that Plunk girl."

1,the story line was not interesting! The plot was very Blah!,My son read this for a required read for summer...He Hated it! Not so much the subject matter but the way it was written!per his opinion the story was needed more excitement. It was just too boring.
4,"This is a good book, but does have language",Rocket Boys is a good book if you count out the language. It is better than the movie in the form that the movie cut out parts. Still the movie and book are two good things to watch or see.
4,If you were born in the 40s,"If you were born in the 40s as I was, in New York, reading this book will take you back to the time you 'heard' about the coaltowns in West Virginia. This story will match your memories ... not to mention your memories of the era it represents. I LOVED it!"
5,Great book about life in mining towns in WV in 70's Loved it,"I have been reading for over 30 years and this book really captured my heart. I was raised in the town it was written in and it really brings back good memories of being raised in a coal camp.The details of how coal ruled everyones lives and how the boys raised above this and everyones expatations of it (except his mother)was the best part. If you were were born and raised in a coal camp you ""must"" read this, if not, you need to read it to see what a great life it was to be part of the coming of age as coal used to be. A very moving book of the hardships of growing up in a ""town in a town"" as Coalwood used to be(dependent upon no one but itself)."
4,Overcoming the Odds,This reminded me why I became an aerospace engineer. Remembering the passions of youth and dreams comes alive in this book as you find yourself becoming one of the boys. Mr. Hickam does a masterful job a revealing what has driven man to take to the skies and reach for more. The problems of real life and the struggle to overcome should be an example to any youth brave enough to dream for more.
5,A Great Book For Everybody,This book is a great book for anybody and everybody. The story Homer Hickam tells is both profound and entertaining. As your reading along you get so engrossed in the drama that you tend to forget it is a nonfiction story. Or rather it seems to be one of those great fiction stories that almost seem real. It is a great buy and I highly recommend it.
5,Really turned my life around,This book really turned my life around. I thought I hated to read but then it was assigned to our summer reading list and I reluctantly took it on. Wow. I just couldn't put it down. Now I want to read everything I can get my hands on although I still haven't read anything this good. Homer was at our high school last month to make a speech and he said the only thing that was changed from what really happen was that he had disguised some people to protect them. He said he also left some things out that happened like more thing that happened at the mine. I guess they'll be in his new book.
5,Amazing,"October Sky was a wonderful memoir of Homer Hickam's teenage life and how he came to be a rocket scientist. The book tells all the details of his teenage life, even the dances he goes to. The charming story of a boy growing up in a coal town of West Virginia brought me to think differently. Homer, having lived in a small town, was not given the opportunities that others might have been given. However, when the satellite Sputnik passed through the sky of his town, Homer begins thinking about rocket science. He begins slowly, exploding his mother's fence, but by the end of the book, has his rockets figured out. While reading this book, I felt as if I had gotten to know the characters. The description written by the author is so real it's as if I myself had been there watching the rocket launches. I recommend this book to anyone!"
5,A wonderful memoir! Rocket Boys made the right stuff!,"Praise to Homer Hickam, Jr. and his rocket boys! It kept me reading with keen interests and wonder how they did successfully in despite of coal mining management-union disputes and a lack of knowledge in rocket engineering. It is also a rich blend of local history of Coalwood, the vivid description of coal mines, and the gradual development of building rockets. A perfect gift for science enthusiasts as well as dream seekers. Bravo, Rocket Boys!"
5,A compelling and inspiring book. . .,"I am a 13 years old, and after seeing the movie ""October Sky"", I instantly fell in love with the story. 14 year old Homer ""Sonny"" Hickman, (son of a superintendant of a mine)was inspired to build a rocket, after hearing and seeing Sputnik. Breaking the mold of his father's dreams, of becoming a miner, Homer is determined to do something with his life. He and his friends make a club dedicated to rockets. Using adavanced books, with complicated math, Homer and his pals are able to do so. Their club takes them above and beyond of what they and their old mine town could imagine. . ."
5,The best book of the year!,"I'm just in the middle of the book, but I've seen the movie. If you haven't seen the movie go rent it right away! I love it! The book seems very intelligent and well written!"
5,:-),I've yet to read the book but if it is at all as good as the movie then I am sure I will enjoy it. Homer's story touches people living in small towns.
5,The book is prodigious,"I loved the movie, ""October Sky."" However, the book goes into more depth than the movie. The relationship between Homer and his parents is far more interesting than the movie's depiction. The book and the movie had the space race, the coming-of-age theme, science fair competition, and young love. The book is written very well. The characters come alive. The book is prodigious, to use one of the character's favorite adjectives."
5,"Loved the movie, the book is even better!",Homer Hickam paints a true and accurate picture of life in small town West Virginia better than anyone I have read prior. The movie takes some creative license with the story and characters. The book however fills in several gaps and gives the reader a less glamorized depiction of his life. Many of the characters (not in the movie) in his book were far more interesting and I'm glad I decided to read this wonderful book!
5,Rocket Boys,"Rocket Boys is definitely a page-turner that I read within a week. The stories of Homer's adolescence are described so vividly that you begin to picture yourself in his place. The title is misleading because it does not just deal with the rockets that he designed but also life and the hardships that he stumbled upon while struggling through high school. This book will be enjoyed by people of all ages whether they have interest in rocket technology or not. The events of his life will touch your heart, make you laugh, and bring you a sense of nostalgia. From the early romances to triumph over the odds, you will be mesmerized by this inspirational book. I am only 13 years old and recommend this book to all who seek a memoir with compelling events in a distinguished man, Homer Hickam."
4,To read & injoys,The book is a good and fun book to read. I read this book then I watched the video and it was also great. The story and the video are easy and sometimes hard to understand what their saying or doing. My mom also enjoyed the book and she hopes that maybe she will get a chance to be able to see the video. I think to the fact that she had enjoyed the book and wants to really see the video so bad that see is looking in stores to be able to see the video that bad.
5,Wow!,"My dad recieved this book for Christmas, and couldn't put it down. He suggested that I read it, knowing that I like this sort of book.. and wow! I loved it. Whomever only saw the movie is missing out on a lot.. and I suggest that they read this book asap. The movie was definatly not as good as the book!"
5,great!!,This a touching story of what the average joe can acomplish. The movie was not half the story and when you read this book you wikk fell like you are part of the space race from a home town aspect. Loved it and hope to read another as good!
5,Telling It Like It Was!,"I may not know a rocket nozzle from a water hose nozzle but I do know Appalachian coal mining camps. I grew up in one in Kentucky the same years Mr. Hickman was firing his rockets in Coalwood, WVA. He knows his miners, his town and his mountains. Coal mining camps were pretty much the same, no matter the state. I recognized the people in his book as people I knew in Lynch, (Harlan County) Kentucky --- only the names had changed. We also had company homes, high school football, The Big Store, unforgettable teachers, mine disasters and moonshine --- but we never had the BCMA and we never had a Homer Hickman. Thank goodness Coalwood did have him because his book is a treasure that takes off like the rockets. If you come from the same background as I do, take a few free hours, grab a comfortable chair and plan to read it in one sitting because you really can't put it down!"
2,"Not ""Good"" Condititon","I ordered this book in ""GOOD"" condition, but when I received the book the spine of the book was ripped, and there were markings on the book. Also, I received the book ""Rocket Boys"", the original book and not the newer version ""October Sky"" which is the one that I ordered. The book condition wasn't horrible, but I would not have rated it ""GOOD."""
5,Awesome Read,Great Book! Being from WV originally and the daughter of a coal miner this book describes WV life accurately. Very heart-warming and enjoyable!!
5,Rocket Boys (aka October Sky) has been picked for our city!,"Rocket Boys also known as October Sky has been picked for Orlando/Orange County One City One Read program. ...We're very excited to have this wonderful book represent our community and all the surrounding counties, the larges library system in the country! This is a book that is loved by all ages and all groups! We're recommending Homer Hickam's great sequels - The Coalwood Way and Sky of Stone, too. The Coalwood trilogy! Only seen the movie? This book is far better and very different!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO COALWOOD,I FEEL SO PROUD TO BE A PART OF THE LIFE OF THE ROCKET BOYS....I LIVE IN 155 FROG LEVEL ROAD AND LOVE IT HERE....I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE MOVIE AND HAVE MET HOMER AND HE IS A REAL GENTLEMAN WITH GREAT EXPECTATIONS...KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK....
2,Poor Quality Paint,"I bought this for an inexpensive 16-ounce hammer to use on some finish work I was doing on a house. However, the head of the hammer is painted black and the paint rubs off easily, which makes this a poor choice for finish work. I wouldn't recommend this unless you are only planning on using it for projects where appearance won't be important - and even then, a 20-ounce hammer might be better for those types of projects."
1,... really???,Ok. You get a blu-ray case. check. Pitch Black on blu-ray. check. Chronicles of Riddick on blu-ray. check. and Dark Fury... on DVD??? really?? really Universal? why?? i bought this because i thought that it was all blu-ray. i already have all the dvds. sigh.. oh well i guess.
5,Awesome!,Nuf said. It was great to see both Pitch Black and Chronicles on Blu-Ray. It was like seeing the movies for the first time all over again. Also comes with Dark Fury so the 3 Disc Set is a hit in my book.
5,"""A Powerful Cute Movie!""","valentin is 8-years old and has a terrible life. His only friend is an acoholic, but is kind to him. Valentine is a foriegn film, but worth reading the subtitles! Then his dad's girlfriend steps into the picture. She betrays him by telling his dad their conversation. Alejandro Agresti is a great actor for his age, and Lecita shines as the mother. The grandmother dies and Valentin becomes really said. I won't tell you anything else, but you should watch this excellent motion picture!"
3,Very Good Human Drama,"Valentin endures manipulation & paternal abuse and prevails. A sad, yet uplifting story. Great soundtrack. Too bad it's not commercially available. It would be worth buying. The deliberate pace will turn off some viewers, but it rewards those who take an interest in seeing how Valentin's plight will evolve. The film will appeal most to those who favor human drama films. Watch the interview with the writer/director in the Special Features before viewing the movie. It's short (about 12 minutes) but very informative. Overall 3+ stars."
4,A wonderful treat,"For those of you who don't know, Valentin is the lovely story of a eight year old boy living in Argentina in the 1960s with his grandmother. His parents are still alive, but his father works in Europe and his mother is... elsewhere.It is a captivating movie. My only criticism of the DVD is that while it is subtitled, there is no dubbing option, and my grandmother is blind, and she wasn't able to listen to the movie and understand the story as she does with English-speaking or English-dubbed films. Otherwise, it is well worth the purchase price."
5,Amazing,"Beautiful, rich story. The acting is superb! You fall in love with the lead character and his complexity of innocence and maturity. It's a must see!"
1,Basic requirement failure.,"All of the listed features of this unit WOULD have been great,if only it had clear sound. I purchased the orange (actually yellow) version (RP2443) of this unit after checking out all the specs on the RCA website. In theory, a great machine. But as soon as I fired it up, I was greeted with background hiss and fluctuating static sounds. I frowned, changed discs, and got the same. I changed headphones - same results. What's the point of using a CD player? I got results like this from audio cassette. Tomorrow, I'll be returning it and try a different product. A frustrating waste of time."
2,Easy operation: Crummy sound,"This unit carries the best price and longest recording capability on he market. Features and operation are excellent, BUT, the sound quality is not acceptable. Tried HQ and SQ - no joy.I do stand-up and need to record both bits and performances.There was nothing funny about this unit and it went back to [the store]. Depending on your needs, this still might be the best deal out there, but it wasn't for me."
4,Miss Smithers Review,"The book was in excellent condition, but it was a different edition than I expected - which was fine, but I wish the picture of the book had been the correct one."
4,A Real Winner,"Alice does not typically go for beauty pageants and all that jazz - but when she discovers that entrants will get $400 for clothes, she's game. (She has her heart set on leather pants.) Sponsored by the Smithers Rod and Gun Club and surrounded by other eccentric participants, Alice quickly learns that she is not the only participant to have ulterior motives.As with the previous novel (Alice, I Think), this story is told in extremely funny diary entries. She is constantly mortified by her New Age-y mom and slacker dad, and often finds her super-smart little brother to be wiser than her grown-up guidance counselor. Her time as Miss Smithers introduces her to karate, tests her vegetarianism, gives her material for her self-published zine, and teaches her the value of a dollar. Okay, maybe not that, but she does ultimately appreciate her true talents, and that's what makes her shine."
2,lousy range,"I have not been able to get the zwave signal to travel 30 feet from an outside zwave outlet to this outlet, the range on this product is terrible."
3,Range challenged,I have two of these in metal enclosures outside the house for outdoor lighting. They are about 20 feet apart. When you are inside you need to be within several feet of one of them through glass to operate them from a Leviton Vizia RF + controller.Comments on their range also appear elsewhere on the internet. YMMV.
2,Works but not as good as Leviton unit...,"I had trouble to configure it at first, intermatic support was bad. Do not report status if switched manually, kind of big and get warm so probably use much more power than the Leviton. Leviton unit report instant status, are smaller and does not get warm. Spend the $30 bucks difference on Leviton and spare time and money on the long run..."
4,Casting,"I felt the casting really took this movie to the next level.I loved the innocence and fragility of filipo, he had me hooked.The movie had me thinking in different directions in the beginning, but not to the point of uninterest. This is not a horror film or ghost story in any sense. It's strictly an engaging thillerThe cinematography reminded me of the work of Terrance Malick, absolutely awe inspiring. This film is extremely worthy."
4,I was hooked from the beginning...,"Michele lives in Italy in the late seventies and spends his days playing with the same friends in his sparse neighborhood and biking through the fields with his little sister.One day, he comes across an abandoned house, where he finds a bowl that looks strangely like those in his own house. There, he discovers a horrifying secret. Suddenly, he is involved and there is no turning back. Should he pretend that he never found out or should his risk his own life and possibly save another?This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. It was suspenseful and touching at the same time. It's scary that things like this have happened. (and still do)Recommended!"
4,Good,"This is an old childhood favorite, and I just had to order 2 of them so my dad and I could each have one! He was really surprised to see that I found some of our old favorites."
4,3 classics for the price is worth it.,"These 3 Ernest movies are some of my favorites from him, other than Ernest goes to jail. Now i have all the movies from him for cheap. Worth the buy."
4,Good Movies bad dvds,the Ernest Films Are Great Movies What Keeps Me From Giving this DvD a 5 star is that so far i have watched ernest goes to camp and the audio on it sounds weird in places sound sort of whisy wash most notable in scenes with noises the audio sounds like it was over filtered or something.but the picture quality is good though guess i expect to much for the price but good set nonetheless
4,Kids love it!!,My kids love Earnest. These are funny movies. I think one of them might have a curse word in it though.
5,Jim Varney is a timeless soul.,"Jim Varney, is a legend especially for the people that grew up watching his movies. And they should without a doubt remember it all."
5,Great picture quality. Anamorphic too!,"I won't bore anyone with an actual review of the films. We all know Ernest is awesome, and these are 3 of the best Ernest films. I was pleasantly surprised with the video quality. They looked very nice played on my upscaling dvd player, and best of all, they are all anamorphic. A must buy for Ernest fans, especially for the price."
4,It was tight,I thought it was worth listening to than some of that other crap. But I think It could have been better. What I really thinks is that Silkks was better.
5,""" IT'S GOOD , IT'S ALL GOOD",THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CD'S I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. IT'S A MUST BUY.
5,TOP 3 IN THE NO LIMIT FAMILY,"FIEND AND THIS ALBUM ARE BOTH IN THE TOP 3 OF THE NO LIMIT FAMILY. FIEND,MAC,AND SOULJA SLIM ARE THE TOP 3 MC'S FOR NO LIMIT. C-MURDER, SILKK THEY ARE COOL TO BUT, THE OTHER THREE ARE THE BEST (IN MY OPINION ) FIEND IS ONE OF THE FEW RAPPERS ON NO LIMIT THAT CAN DO THE ALBUM ALL BY HIM SELF. THIS ALBUM IS IN THE TOP 3 OF THE NO LIMIT ALBUMS. MAC'S SHELL SHOCKED, AND SOULJA SLIMS ALBUMS COME CLOSE. IT'S A COIN TOSS. THIS ALBUM KICKS ASS, FROM START TO FINISH...IT HAS GREAT BEATS, AWESOME LYRICS, FIEND'S VOICE SOUNDS ORIGIONAL...AND EVEN THO HE DOESN'T NEED THEM THE GUEST RAPPERS JUST ADDS TO THIS ALBUM. THIS IS THE ALBUM TO GET AT ANY PRICE. HIS SECOND ALBUM IS O.K. BUT THIS IS THE ONE...IF YOU FIND IT DON'T EVER LET IT GO."
4,Much better than Street Life!,"Fiend's No Limit debut album ""There's One In Every Family"" is MUCH better than his disappointing 1999 album ""Street Life""! The best song on the album is Take My Pain but other good songs on it include Going Out With A Blast, Do You Know?, Big Timer, Who Got The Fire, I Swore, All I Know, The Streets Ain't Safe, Only A Few, The Baddest, Slangin', Walk Like A ""G"", and Do You Wanna Be A Rider! All No Limit fans go pick this up if you have Street Life and were disappointed with it!"
5,DESERVES MORE THAN 5 STARS!!!!,To tell ya the truth. Greatest No Limit CD I have heard I can't wait till Stree Life. I think that if he and Servon did a good quality song and made a video so it got some recognition it would be at the top of the charts. People just don't know about him. I just hope that Stree Life can hang on I couldn't expect it to be better.
5,THE BEST DAMN RAP CD EVER!!!!!!,"the only thing i can say about ""There's One In Every Family"" is that no one will ever be able to touch it. whoo knew an unknown rapper from Nawlins could bump something wild like this? if you are a no limit fan and dont have this, you need to be smacked."
2,Don't expect too much from this book.,"As a former youth and children's minister I expected so much more from this book. For the price, it was considerably weak and felt down right cheesy at times. The pre-teen age years are formidable years to begin to develop your kids beyond the, ""bible story"" based curriculum we see in so many Sunday school classes. This is the time to start teaching the deeper biblical truths that will form a lasting foundation throughout their teen years and beyond. Include the fact that these years may be the last time your kids hear you for about six years and you have a perfect storm of teach ability as well as understanding.Don't waste your money on this book. We have just started to sit down and are reading through the gospel with our kids. This goes way further than and pre packaged devotional ever will."
5,Loved the Hoppers...,"Tides tells the story of Hab, a sailor who lives in Paras, a lush, fertile continent. He is plagued by curiosity and an inventive drive, so much that he is willing to go against the Parassian philosophy of honesty. When he stumbles upon a scientist who has found proof of a continent other than Paras on the other side of the world, he is bested by his own nature. He embezzles his family fortune and builds state of the art ships to help him avoid the monster tides. He finds a rocky, bleak continent infested with hoppers, an amphibian race of warriors. I loved the way Hab had to go against the honesty religion and how he discovered that he was being lied to by the hoppers, how he was being tricked. The voyage parts were good, and not too drawn out. All the little details make it an excellent read."
2,Not nearly as special as they sound,I box a case of these and treated some pumkin and ginger fans. One liked them a lot; most were indifferent. Taste is not pumkin spicy enough but ginger is nicely done. Some found fault with the texture - neither crisp nor chewy. I would say they were a nice try but not a winner.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Every box was BROKEN PIECES - EVERY SINGLE COOKIE! I stood over my garbage container & poured out all 6 boxes. The package says ""chews"" so I thought they would be soft, instead they were dry & packed loosely. Total waste of $15 cuz AMAZON will not refund on grocery items. Very disappointing."
3,decent,"not as good as I expected from reviews, but not bad. very very crumbly--expect crumbs all over. good chocolate fix, but did not taste like brownie to me. am not sure of value--kinda pricey for what you get per box."
1,WRONG ITEM PICTURED!,"As I write this (and as I ordered it), the picture of the item shows a band-type clamp. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS! If you order this item, you will receive a plain old U-bolt-type clamp that you can pick up at any corner auto store. And now amazon wants ME to pay to ship it back in order to refund the purchase price!"
1,A real Disappointment,If you can get theses tracks on Lime wire do it & save the $. The music isn't that great and its expensive.
4,Advanced research results on signal processing for CDMA,"This book presents many advanced results on adaptive signal processing for CDMA communications. The author has done many works in this area.The book is a good reference for university students, researchers and engineers."
2,austrailian rockers,"this is a pretty cool cd. its hard, edgy, slow stuff. these austrailian rockers are not the same band as midget, who released ""alco-pop"" and ""jukebox,"" just so you don't get mixed up."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to replace one of my older control records, the package itself came right on time but when I opened it to check it I found it was cracked. The box and material it was shipped in looked like they would hold fairly well so Idk what happened. I've already ordered new ones but as I said I was just a little bit disappointed."
3,Not as creamy milk chocolatey as they look!,Purchased these for my family who loves chocolate covered peanuts.These were good but very dry and the chocolate tasted old. We like the planters or Farley brand better.
4,great stuff!,"A very enjoyable collection of short stories, a novella, and poems that compose a detailed portrait of the author. Admittedly, ""The Hemmingway Hoax"" is pretty darn confusing, but the first two short stories are so good, I just didn't care. As for the poems, it's been a while since I've had any desire to read modern poetry, but Haldeman got my attention with them. In each part of this collection, he shows the amazing ability to compose very vivid images with the use of few words, something most authors these days know nothing about. Oh yes, the author's notes at the end of each piece are fascinating. I wish I could give this 9 out of 10."
3,Not bad.,"The storie's were good with the exception of the Vietnam war referance in most of the storie's. 1 or 2 would have been alright,but not most of them."
4,Read this book.,Haldeman is quickly becoming one of my favorite science fiction authors. This collection of short stories will make you want to burn a sick-day just to be able to stay home and finish it.I feel I can forgive him for writing Forever Peace now. :)Haldeman has the nack for describing a lot with very few words; something I wish more authors would do.
3,"Great to read about, when its not required.","I had to order this book for a college History class. The book does a good job explaining the history, but that doesn't mean its my kind of book. I'm more into history textbooks than bibliography's."
3,Cannot plug it into power with the case on,"The case feels sturdy enough and looks good, but the battery case for the LEDs adds unecessary size to the player, and worse, you can no longer plug the Sansa to power or a USB connection while the case is on, as it blocks the bottom port of the Sansa."
2,Well-built - - - POORLY designed,"I would give this 5 stars if you could actually use it and the Sansa together. It snaps on tight and seems great for the player's protection. Still allows all controls to be used and the lights are fun- if you're into ""fun"". :-)BUT you have to remove the Sansa from this case every time you'd want to charge it or transfer music/videos..."
3,Informative on NSC 68,"It was very helpful during my research on Cold War foreign policy and I enjoyed it very much. I would definately reccomend this book to anyone interested in the Cold War, a must have!"
3,Critique's Choice - Not Mine,"I was somewhat dissappointed in Roger Ebert. I thought before I read this book that he and I were more on the ""same page"" about movies so I thought I would get good recommendations but I had aleady viewed most of the films he summarized and I disagreed with him on how great these were. Many of them I didn't like at all."
2,Sloppy,"As a die-hard fan of the classic film ""Jaws,"" I was pleasantly surprised to see Ebert's take on it in this volume. I realize at the outset that what I'm about to say is nit-picking, but here goes.First off, the quote from Roy Scheider's character Brody is, ""YOU'RE gonna need a bigger boat,"" rather than ""We're"" as is listed here.Secondly, whoever did the proofreading for this book needs to have their head examined. Ebert quotes Richard Dreyfus' character Hooper as saying -""I pulled a tooth the size of a shot glass out of the rectal of a boat out there, and it was the tooth of a Great White.""Not WRECKED HULL.Sloppy editing. I tossed the book after reading this. Have no use for someone who doesn't respect cinema enough to have somebody proofread his work."
2,why would one see or not see a movie based upon one man's advice,"roger ebert has his own individual tastes and I respect that. I have my my own tastes too. Ebert thought ""the pillow book"" was a great film. He didn't like reservoir dogs. Don't adhere to this guy's recommendations. Anyone who does should read a story called the emporor's new clothes and reflect on the moral."
2,It's for beginners.,"If you already know how to set up NT server, IIS and SQL, this book is not for you. There are not much useful information for serious developers."
1,"Great title, but doesn't deliver on content.","Most of the book covers basic set-ups for NT, IIS, SQL Server. The same information that is standard with these products. What the book covers on building MS SQL Server 7 Web sites could fit in a pamphlet. Save your money!"
1,Very Poor Book,"The title and the index imply a book with a large amount of useful information covering a wide range of web site development subjects but focusing on using SQL 7 on web sites. On page 261 of 436, more than halfway through the book, you are still waiting for the author to start the main subject - interesting, he never does. It is a very fast read, because there is no depth to the book. I wasted my money - don't waste yours. How did this book ever get to print?"
3,19th century overview,"This is a good overview of the the late 19th century thought concerning Kabbalism and it's importance. Some of the basic ants are discussed, but not in any detail. This book looks more at some of the aspects of practical Kabbalism rather than theoretical Kabbalism."
5,I saw the movie,"I didn't read the book but I just saw the movie at the Vancouver International Film Festival. It was great! Funny, dark humour, and paints a picture of ""slackers"" in Berlin in the late 80's just before the wall came down. If the book is anything like the movie, it should be a great read!"
4,Interesting Details Provided,"The author of this book claims to have been a piano player for Al Capone. Al often would request him to play Al's favorite song, Roses of Picardy. The author claims to have been taken along to witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and provides interesting details of what took place. He claims some of the victims were swearing while others cried because they knew what fate awaited them. He also claims to have been in a barbershop with Capone and Machine Gun Jack McGurn when it was reported that Capone torpedos John Scalise, Albert Anselmi, and Joe Guinta were killed. He reports that Capone was upset with this while McGurn told him it had to be done. He exonerated Capone who it is often claimed clubbed the trio to death with a baseball bat following a party in nearby Hammond, Indiana. Interesting details are provided in this book, and we as readers are left to decide whether or not they are true."
3,Entertaining Hokum,Of course it's well known that Jack Woodford had nothing to do with this supposed interview of him. Great and hilarious fiction tho!
3,"Entertaining, but...","This is a fun read, but just when you think you've uncovered a gold mine of ""inside"" information about Al Capone, a bubble bursts with some inaccurate--but entertaining facts!The author/interviewee drop some not so subtle hints about the Irving/Howard Hughes hoax, and also the authenticity of letters actually written by Capone while in prison. Placing Jack McGurn and the interviewee at the scene on Valentine's Day was a bit of a giveaway.Still, there are some careful retellings of some infamous gang incidents in 1920s Chicago which are lovingly recreated here. Let's place this one somewhere between ""Little Big Man"" and ""Forrest Gump"" in terms of having a living witness recall some of the great incidents and characters in Chicago history. As such, it is certainly both entertaining...and challenging!"
3,Not as good as I remembered as a kid...,"It's one of the better turn-based strategies, but it's still turn based, and I'm not a fan of turn-based."
5,Great Stuff,This is the best thickening cream I have found. Put in blow dry and you can see and feel the difference.
4,"Good, Cheap, Works","What do you want from a cheap s-video cable? It's Belkin, they've been making decent cables for years and that's why I leaned towards this one. There are many cheap cables out there but you can't go wrong with Belkin.Using it to go from my computer out to my living room, 30 feet was exactly what I needed and it works perfect, I notice NO signal loss after 30 feet, can't complain."
5,Perfect Quality,"Exactly what I was looking for, great insulation against other power sources and long enough to reach a ceiling mounted DLP, only Pure A/V versions of Belkin cords for me from now on."
2,NOPE!,The prongs have broken off with in two weeks of use. It was pulled out of tv once and now it does not work. Not very good workmenship.
3,too much shielding!,"this cable works great but there is too much shielding at the end. i physically had to cut the yellow part of the cable back to fit in the recessed input on a projector that i purchased. other than that, it was the right legth and price for the project i had. amazon made the process quick and convenient. thanks amazon!!"
1,cheezy comedy,"I LOVE bollywood movies, comedy movies and sometimes the comedy in bollywood movies. However I thought this one stunk. The dance sequences are one of my favorite parts in a bollywood movie and those in this flick generally lacked any good moves, costumes or music. Also, even though bollywood characters are mostly based on stereotypes and I'm o.k. with that, I found the characters in this movie to be mean-spirited, unromantic, and goofy in a bad way. I haven't even finished watching it. For perspective, since others seem to like this movie, my favorites so far are ""Straight From The Heart"" , ""Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke"" and ""Lagaan"""
3,Not bad.,"Bought keychain as a gift for my InuYasha fan. She loved it, but the charms came off easily."
4,Nice old book,"We had Dondo as part of our curriculum years back, I am sure there are other books now that work but this one was a good start."
2,Damaged in shipping!,"What appeared to be a nice system was damaged when we received it. It was a Christmas gift and couldn't be used. A new one was supposed to be shipped out ASAP and 2 - 3 wks later we had yet to receive it. Upon contacting Beach Audio...they were currently out of stock...however, we did receive credit in a timely fashion...just no replacement."
5,Good System for the Money,"We use this system for dragon boat races and similar outdoor events. It produces volume adequate to be heard about 300' away, which is all we needed. Depending on your set up, you may want to get longer speaker cords. Also, we bought the speaker stands that put the speakers well above the ground. The problem we have had with those is they let the speaker swivel, since the post is round. The wind often blows ours to face in the wrong direction. I think an oval post on the stand and corresponding hole on the bottom of the speaker would have solved that.The entire system folds up into one package. That package is a bit bulky and heavy to be easily carried any distance, but it does protect the most delicate parts of the system. It also has a little chamber to hold the cords and mic."
5,They were expendalble,"Wow!!! Powerful movie on the struggle to fend off the Japanese after Pearl Harbor. Based on the actual events during December 1941 to May 1942, Mac Arthur's escape from the Phillipines he vowed ""I shall return"" not to be confused with the Terminator's""I'LL BE Bock"".The Pt boats in the film were left over's from WWII and were comprized of 80 ft Elco's Higgin's 77 footer and a Huckin's Pt in the Mix. Lots of WWII A-A between ships and planes.You won't be disappointed!!!!!!!"
4,they were expendable,"The video came as stated, great quality and time frame of delivery. Nice price. A great addition to my collection"
5,The best war movie of all time!,"I am a Navy veteran. I served in the Submarine service, and truly understand what it means to live with men facing danger at all times. They Were Expendable is a film about courage,sacrifice, and the hard decisions that men under arms must face on a daily basis. I felt like a member of the crew, and at no time did I feel that I was ""watching a movie."" It should make all Americans understand what all servicemen in the Philipines did in the early months of World War II. They fought the holding action that led to our eventual victory!THE BEST WAR MOVIE IN OUR HISTORY!"
5,An Outstanding War Film,"I agree wholeheartedly with those giving this movie 5 stars. If you are a WWII buff, THIS MOVIE MUST BE ADDED TO YOUR COLLECTION. If your eyes don't get a little misty at the end when the last C-47 departs the Phillipines as the Japs close in, YOU ARE NOT AN AMERICAN. Major Dave Garrison, USAF Retired"
3,They were...and so is this movie.,"I have one thing to say.....BORING!I should have followed my instincts on this one, but unfortunately I fell for some of the reviews here and that was clearly a mistake.First of all Robert Montgomery is terrible in the lead role, he just doesnt have the presence to pull it off. And secondly, if you expect action in this film you will be sorely disappointed, as I am. Like I said, I should have known better. No disrespect to the men that fought in the Pacific, but this movie doesnt do you justice. Very dull. Wish I hadn't bought this."
4,Excellent film for it's age,"I like PT Boats, and this film does not disappoint. It's a mixture of war, action, and some light romance. I think this movie shows just how PT boats were used, and how dangerous the work was."
5,Unique WWII Movie,"This is a very well made WWII movie, and unique because it covers a part of the war not often the focus of movies or documentaries, and is about PT Boats which are generally ignored as well. The only other movie of any note about PT Boats is ""PT 109"" which really focuses on John Kennedy's heroics. The acting in this movie is understated which makes every scene seem real. The action scenes are great, and the lead roles are in good hands with Robert Montgomery, John Wayne, Ward Bond, and Donna Reed. The relationship which builds between John Wayne and Donna Reed, but which you know is somehow doomed because of the approaching invasion of the Japanese, is very poignant. This film is a great classic and doesn't get the credit it deserves."
4,Better War Film,"This is one of the better known films about World War II. It has very high production standards. It is about U.S. PT boats in the Philippines after Pearl Harbour. It is a very good action film, but by todays standards this film is not believable. The heros are too Ideal and the Japs are a little too helpless fighting the heros to be realistic. Still, watch this film to see the spirit that the Americam public believed in at the time."
4,Classic,"A great rally round the flag boys film with some wonderful WW2 video of PT boats. Hey, it's the Duke . . . what else do you need?"
3,Fun to put together but it lost its flavor,It took my son about an hour or 2 to put together. After playing with it for a few days it now finds itself with a ton of other toys in the back of the closet. Not really a knock against the product as it was really fun to put together and play with but it just didn't hold his attention long enough.
2,Feng Shui for Kids,"A very kiddie approach to Feng Shui. A very broad basic overview of Feng Shui in simple terms, but definitely kid oriented. Nothing really practical here."
5,Always a winner with this author,I have read his complete series on submarines and have never been disappointed. These are must read for submarine fans.
1,"Predictable, Depressing, and Bloody","Bought this book for reading material on a business trip. I found it very slow to get going and strangely depressing. The plot - terrorist hijackers, as usual - didn't get under way until almost halfway through the book. The first part was a lot of run-of-the-mill potboiling and military exercise. The action section was really gory, almost to the point of making me wince. Not in a good way either. I didn't really see the point. All in all Vertical Dive is a pretty hack pulp fiction testosterone trip without anything new to say. Spend your eight bucks elsewhere."
3,Quite a Let Down,"The authors divorce, some details of which he shared with me in an email, seems to have made his mood even more dark than usual. It was very hard to get into, something his other books have not been. I thought it was me as I kept putting it down to do other things but it was just difficult. Hopefully, Patty will become a memory and Michael can return to his normal form. He is an excellent writer but this was not a great example. Get well soon."
2,NOT UP TO HIS PREVIOUS,"Not really much to say, I have read all his other books, but by far his worst. I'm not really into ghosts in subs, the rest of the plot was not too bad. But I have to agree with a previous reviewer, a billion dollar sub sent out on an exercise in a hurricane and his dead wife telling him what to do?"
5,Riveting!!! And Heartwarming,"This is one that you just cannot stop watching. The story is really not predictable to a degree. There are some spots where you just want to scream at some of the characters. Of course you will cry as well as cheer. The actors are so good that you actually can feel their joy and their pain. I thoroughly enjoyed this series and highly recommend it, especially if you would like to see the behind the scenes working of gambling casinos and youlove Song Hye-Kyo and Lee Byung-Hun. They are wonderful in this story."
5,K DRAMA ALL IN,ALL IN is a k-drama that draws you right into it. You will find yourself going thru the emotions of the characters and sometimes talking to the screen because you are so involved. This is truly one of the good ones with many lasting memories and enjoyable viewing hours. You will want to watch it again and again although it's memory will last for sometime. The actors are believable and have so much realisim. A well deserved A plus all around.
2,Not as good as the original book,"I was disappointed with this drama. I have read the original book which was based on a real life story of a Korean poker player-baduk player Cha Min-soo. The drama turns it into something totally different. I don't understand why they even bothered to title it ""All-in"" ? They would even advertise as ""Based on real story..."". I don't think so, 'very very loosely based on' at best."
5,Great for Beginners,"If you know very little about the whys & wherefores of weather then this is the book for you. It is a light read and gives you all you need to know. You won't be able to work as a professional weatherman, but you will get a good grasp of the intricate science of meteorology. I recommend the book and the price is right."
2,"DVD player very poor - ""cannot read disc"" error",The DVD player is horrendous. You would expect a $4000 system to at least have the capability of playing DVD's properly. I watched 2 new DVD's and both could not play the end of the movies. I had to finish watching them on my 5 yr old Sony DVD player. I have read about others having problems with DVD's burned from a DVD burner but these were orginals (V for Vendetta). I will soon be contacting Bose about this issue as my unit is only a few months old. I had upgraded from the Lifestyle 25 because the disc magazine was stuck on that unit. I am very disappointed and disgusted after paying so much money for a terrible DVD player.
2,Where's the HDMI or Component AT?,"If im gonna spend $2-4k on bose, I would expect the system be up to date, Wheres the option for HDMI or COMPONENT out video at? Not just S-VIDEO. Since i have HD TV this system be worthlessOUT, VERY VERY DISsapointing, NO THANKS"
2,"""It's all my fault.""","Historians say that history is always written by the victors so this historical novel is a good southern perspective of the battle. My age group is busy gathering facts so I think this book may be too misleading. For example in the last part of the book, General George Gordon Meade is killed by Wade Hampton supposedly along Pipe Creek after the disasterous defeat at Union Mills. Meade's body is carried back to the confederate camp where General Lee hears the good news. But according to another reference book General George Gordon Meade was an American general whose dates are 1815 to 1872. The defeat at Union Mills in northern Maryland was within days of the July 1-3, 1863 battle at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. But I loved the dialogue in the story. It shows the North slowly beginning to produce generals and an army to defeat the South. The characters also tell the hardships of total war that both sides experienced. The dialogue catches the reader and sounds very natural."
3,very cute but misleading. it is seriously small.,"i bought this for my daughters halloween bag, she is a vampire. we will have to empty it every other house it is sooooooooo small. it is VERY cute though"
3,Not a good reproduction,"I purchased this because it had an incident that actually took place, the appendectomy aboard a submarine. The story was good but the reproduction got distorted in the middle. The picture was jerky, jumpy, and the sound stopped and started. It was disturbing. I don't know if it was just my copy or all the CDs are like that."
4,Good war movie,"Good solid movie showing how the United States overcame the loss of her main capital ships at Pearl Harbor, by using the silent service to remain in the war, and prevent the Japanese from invading Hawaii."
4,The Keys Of The Kingdom,"A fine movie, Peck is the best. This is about a missionaries life. It might touch on the meaning of life for some. Is happiness about getting things or service to mankind?"
4,"Still great action film, after all these years","Given the state of special effects at the time, the model work is excellent. Real Navy feel for the submarine patrols in the diesel boats. Good script,with a touch of the authentic. The ensemble cast of Grant,Hutton, Garfield, and so many other Warner faces from the thirties in this 40 flic is hard to find anyplace else. Grant lets other cast get in some closeup time,graceful actor. I want to add one note to a previous comment about Run Silent Run Deep, that was not John Wayne movie, but rather Clark Gable. And, I recall,Burt Lancaster. No matter. I hope this one gets resurrected on DVD, as They Were Expendable did. I like the line where Grant says ""this boat has taken enough"",surfaces and blows hell out of the Japanese tin can that has been pursuing them. Great fun."
4,The Definition of A Power Trio,"The Powder Monkeys are one of those many bands that will go in the annals of ""great band, largely unnoticed"". However, don't let that stop you from grabbing onto this awesome, powerchord driven trio's album. Hailing from Australia, as the other reviewers have mentioned, these three punks take the finer elements of both the Stooges - Motorhead and turn it into something of their own. The songs are melodic yet really heavy at the same time. In particular, songs such as ""Into the Doldrums"" and ""Wasn't Born Yesterday"" really stand out for the weight and the punch they wield. Really good album that will have me checking out more of their titles in the future. I can't wait for my obsessive collecting tendencies to be satisfied."
4,yeah gangatsafied,"yeah hoo bangin party can't go wrong here features, the comradz, and westside connection and those g funk son of p funk weast caost gangstafied beats you can ride off."
4,Witty Comments to Help You Win at Telephone Tag,Have you always wished you had a witty response to those annoying answer machine messages? Here is your chance to have those witty responses right at your fingertips.
5,funny funny funny,I've loved this book for years and still love it! Lewd crude and rude and hands down hilarious!
5,ACP-EP 1GB Memory,"I bought two of these units and they have made a dramatic difference to my four year-old PC. After installing a new anti-virus program (name withheld, but I'm sure you all know which one), my PC was as slow as molasses! These units were very easy to install and everything runs much, much faster now. I recommend getting the most memory you can for your machine. Thanks!"
1,family troubles,"I know the family of the guy who wrote this, and i must say that if they are the same as he is, you shouldnt read it."
4,A monster on the loose.,This book is great. I can vividly see the pictures in my head of all he wrote. Great choice of words. I am glad I chose this as a book to read for my enjoyment.
2,Too complex,"To be honest, I did not like this book. I only kept reading it becuase I wanted to give a review and did not think it fair to do so without reading the whole book.The ""horror"" and ""gore"" were good. The plot bad. Way too complex and too many sidestories going on at once. I felt myself constantly having to go back and double-check facts."
5,My first brush with Slade,"This was my first Slade book and I still have a special place for it. I've been around the block a few times and have to say that no one can write quite like Slade. I looked around and burned my way through several horror fiction writers before stumbling across this one quite by accident. I was browsing through a bookstore and kind of liked the skull hologram on the book's front. I hadn't even heard of the guy. Great book great writer/s...somehow though, this one is still the best, none of the others seem quite like it."
5,"The more you read, the more you want to read. It's great.","This book keeps you guessing the whole way through without ever giving a clue to the outcome. The characters appear real and the real life situations are something you hope to never experience. Pardon the cliche, it's spellbinding and I could hardly put it down."
4,Back on Track!!!,This is more like it. A good exciting book that keeps on moving. It was not as good as Absolute Power but way better than The Winner. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good non-stop excitment.
1,This isn't writing; this is publishing.,"My wife pushed me to read this, but this is probably the worse book I've ever read. Except for the detail (ie, a secretary explaining back-up tapes to Sidney), the plot and characters are much better suited for a comic book, rather than a novel.There is no character development, no theme, and no plot development. There are no hints as to why the character act the way they do. I didn't even like the characters, even the ""good"" ones I was supposed to like.Balducci and his agent wrote the book with story boards for the next movie in mind. That would explain why they thought it would be a great idea for an FBI agent to oggle a greiving widow immediately before her husband's funeral. And all the references to Sidney's ""sexiness""...Bottom line: ...bad writing."
1,Needs more editing,"This book had the good story line, but the details were not there to support the plot. Suspense is not having the main character running around like a loose cannon never seeing farther than the end of her nose. I can't think what parts irritated me more, but the total incompetence of Sidney at times playing into the hands of the ""bad guys"" didn't cut it with me."
1,My high school English teacher weeps ...,I wrote better prose than this when I was in tenth grade - and I'm an accountant
1,Poorly Structured Effort by Baldacci,"TOTAL CONTROL is David Baldacci's second novel, following his tremendous debut ABSOLUTE POWER. Unfortunately, Baldacci suffers from a major case of the sophomore jinx here.The major problem with this novel is the byzantine plot. The storyline is so convoluted that I had real problems following it. A series of events take place and Baldacci makes little effort to connect them coherently. Normally, Baldacci's strength is his plotting and pacing, but those skills are largely absent in this novel.The characterization in TOTAL CONTROL is paper-thin, which is a common problem with a lot of Baldacci's work. Normally, his plotting skills make up for the cartoonish characters, but that doesn't happen here. The result is a tedious, confusing read that is not worth your time.I've read about eight novels by Baldacci, and I would say TOTAL CONTROL was probably the worst of the bunch. Avoid this one, and read ABSOLUTE POWER if you haven't done so already."
2,Would make a great silent movie,"Interesting idea, but oddly written. I'm not talking grammar and syntax, like some other reviewers. I refer to the over-the-top style. Everything is a crisis!!! On every page characters are wincing or gimacing, their throats are constricting, they cannot breathe. I spent a lot of my time rolling my eyes. Why didn't I just put it down? Good question- it is just compelling enough to keep turning those pages."
3,Partial Control of the Subject Matter,"Baldacci sticks to his proven suspense-thriller formula, but doesn't fill the pages with characters that are believable or make you care about them. Not bad, but certainly not his best work."
3,It'd be better if...,"Albeit this is not the best Baldacci's book is a readable one, the first pages are heavy as lead though, but if you go through the first 150 or so pages the rest of the book is good enough to end it. You can also skip the part when the book explains how the economy works and what happen if the interest rate gets up or down. Maybe you will have to be in mood to read this one but at the end of it you will not regret reading it.I think this book'd be better if were written after the WTC massacre."
5,Couldn't put it Down,Very good. I loved it and would offer this book to anyone who is looking for a book that keeps you guessing and wants a cliff hanger. Yaa Sidney... ;)
1,"Raves, or Ads?","A piece of advice to surfers reading these reviews: a rave is one thing, but one that seems so worshipful of the text in question as to be nearly orgasmic should be highly suspect of being less a neutral review and more an advertisement submitted by paid employees of the publisher."
3,An early example,"Good, intricate plot lines. The writing is overblown and the characters a bit cardboard. His later work is better, but this seems like an example of a good thriller writer in his early stages of development."
2,Almost A Good One,"Baldacci almost struck gold with this one. But..... The narrative starts off at a fast pace. Got my interest going quickly. Then the first surprise came up. Good One! Hadn't thought of that possibility. But then the book keeps going, and going, and going, and going, with plot reversal after plot reversal....to the point that it is difficult to remember how one got to where the book is. This book could have been shortened by half, or turned into two books. The thing is just too darn long, and never comes to an end."
4,Keeps you thinking,"The story has many twists and turns, and possibilities that will keep your interest high, work you in trying to figure out whichcharacter is the one who is key to the surrounding plot. I read a lot of authors of books of this nature, and most of themare military in nature, this book held my interest untill the end, and I intend to read more of this authors work."
3,9 Lives,"Haven't the Bad Guys learned yet, that you can't pick on Superwoman???? Maybe I'll send them an email an explain it to them."
3,Just okay,"This was the first Baldacci novel I've read. There was just too many ""yeah, right"" moments in the book. One day Sidney is a sweet, insecure lawyer; the next she's pistol-whipping bad guys. Almost 700 pages long, but it easily could have been condensed into 500. But I really liked the characters Sawyer and Gamble. Hopefully Sawyer will return in a Baldacci novel."
3,Ho-Hum,Not Baldacci's best - just an average thriller. Usually This author defines his characters and events better than what I found in this book.
4,Yet another page turner!,"In this novel of intrigue and science, Baldacci suggests a world where the bad guys develop technology that turns the entire world's security on its head. By inventing a technique that renders security screening obsolete, a frightening new world could be ushered into being. Unless of course Oliver Stone and his club of misfit friends, with the welcome addition of an MI 6 operative can stop it. Well constructed, and within the bounds of possibility, this makes for a good read indeed!"
2,Real Disappointment,"Don't you just hate in the slasher movies where the teenage girl is being chased out the front door by some guy in a hockey mask wielding a cleaver and instead of running toward the potential safety of neighbors, she runs around the house into the dark, secluded woods.That's exactly how I felt reading this book. The main character just keeps making terrible choices that kept me wincing through the whole book. I'm not a stickler for believability in a book like this, but I hate when a supposedly intelligent lawyer, wife and mom makes absurd choices one after another.I'm not sure why I finished reading this book except to say that it held my attention just enough to keep me reading to the end.And see how many times Sidney, the main character, has ""tears streaming down her face"". I lost count.You probably want to pass on this book."
5,A terrific read right from the start!,"I had never read Baldacci before, but this book grabbed me right from the start and didn't let go! This would make a great movie! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes their books to have action, suspense, and a lot of twists.A must read for any Ludlum fan!"
2,Not near as good as Absolute Power - a disappointment,"After reading Baldacci's debut book ""Absolute Power"" I was really looking forward to ""Total Control"". Pace was too slow, story was ""padded"" with a lot of ""technobable"" (sp), jumped around too much and just not that interesting. I'm not finished yet, up to page 170 (approx) and still waiting for the page-turner part"
4,Total Control draws the net and wont let go!,"Absolute Power started the roller coaster ride that is continued by Total Control!! Through the eyes of Sydney Archer, we are taken for a thrill ride of suspense and danger that doesn't forget that we have emotions. David Baldacci did a masterful job of introducing us to characters that we can understand and sympathize with. The characters respond in ways we would expect them to if the situation were real, not like puppets to make the novel run smoothly. We learn to love and hate, and even to mourn with his characters. Baldacci has forged for himself a place with the great action and suspense authors like Dick Francis and Clive Cussler, and he will always be welcome on my bookshelf"
2,Total Control is a Total Disappointment.,"To those of you who are expecting something at least as good as Absolute Power, wait. Wait for the paperback so you can cut your losses. The story goes in circles. The key to a good novel is that it makes you wonder what will happen next. This book doesn't. Hopefully, he'll find his voice on the next book"
3,Good beach book.,"Unfortunately, not upt to par with ""Absolute Power"". Far too many story lines and plot twists. While I enjoyed the book and recommend it, I was somewhat disappointing"
5,A terrific read,"This is an older novel that has lost none of its steam. Their are many twists and turns, but for the most part they retain the plausibility that often goes out the window. Since this is an older book and technology plays such a strong role, there are many things which technologically are out of date. If you look at it as a historical novel, albeit recent, that potential problem area fades rapidly. Highly recommended."
4,Would make a good movie,"Good plot, lots of twists and turns,likeable heroine(albeit pretty dumb for an attorney)and if you skip all the extraneous detail about the computer programs, it moves along quickly.Would make an exciting and pacy movie."
2,Fair thriller -- he has done better.,The dialogue is a bit weak and the story isn't believeable at times. Descriptions of the emotions of some of the characters was excellent but other parts of the book were very sub-par.
4,Very enjoyable! Great 'beach read'.,"Baldacci is no Stegner when it comes to writing style, but despite the 'unpolishedness', I couldn't put it down. The plot twists were both surprising and convincing. The characters were stereotypical, but were still very likable (or hateable!) and not altogether unbelievable. I will definately take Baldacci to the beach again!"
3,A little long,I have been a fan of David Baldacci for the past two years. I enjoy reading his books normally. For some reason I felt like I was never going to finish the book and then I felt let down with the ending. After following the trail across the country I guess I was hoping for a happier ending.
1,Big Letdown,"The book was interesting, but to do all that reading and be let down at the end...Very disapointing."
1,Awful.,"Baldacci must have a lot of close personal friends. There is no other way to explain a positive review of this book. Bad character development, rediculous plot, poor (if any) research."
1,Implausible story with many technical inaccuracies.,"Implausible story with many technical inaccuracies, and with unrealistic characters (even allowing for poetic license). The technological aspects of the book were not authentic. I believe this book had the potential to be excellent. More research, better writing, and better editing would have helped."
4,Awesome,"Beleive it or not, I stayed up the whole night to read it. Reason? The book is unputdownable. It involved computers and technology stuff and the power and secrets held by powerful people in the company. It is a must-read book, though the part about the plane crash is a little unrealistic."
4,Exciting Read,"Thought I had run out of good thriller authors to read but when I read Total control I was enlightened. Have since read two other Baldacci novels and have enjoyed all of them. Total Control is a fast paced, interesting story that's both technical and suspenseful without being bland or tedious."
2,sophmoric effort,"baldacci is a masterful storyteller; but this, his second book,belies the fact.overly long,tedious and desultory.heroine escapes death more often than the cartoon coyote survives mishaps.skipping over this one to his subsequent works is highly recommended."
3,High concept thrillers improve with research,"A technical gripe from a pilot. Baldacci blows off the right wing of an airplane and describes the result: ""The L800 immediately rolled left ..."" Not in this solar system it wouldn't. Wings create lift, in essence pulling the plane upward. Destroy the right wing and it leaves only the left wing pulling up, rotating the plane to the RIGHT, not the left. It's like reading that someone jumped off a building and fell up into moon. I know, I know, nobody cares about such quibbles except a few pilots to whom it's like fingernails on a blackboard but it tossed me right out of my belief in the world Baldicci was creating. Just a humble plea for better research or more thorough editing."
3,Total Control is a little hard to believe,This book really stretches the readers' imagination. The plot line while interesting is not believable or in any way based on reality. Fiction it is and fiction is what we got. It keeps your interest but it is too transparent as fiction. I like somewhat believable fiction.
3,Excellent Suspense,"This is David Baldacci's best book for suspense. Absolute Power had its dull moments, but Total Control was non-stop. However, the action leaves something to be desired and seems like it belonged to an action movie."
4,entertaining,"I loved this book. I work in the IT field and am always amazed at how wrong the authors GET information, but at the same time I love to read it. I read technical documents all day long and sometime into the night so to sit in a hot bath with a glass of wine and get lost in a story that has no real technical validity is a real treat. I just love wondering ""who did it"" and although I have not yet completed this story I almost don't want to finish it because I haven't read another like it in a while.Got to go, I can hear the tub running!"
2,"Read it for the plot, not the writing","I needed an action packed, low thought process book for my vacation. I read this in about a 24 hour period. The writing was very poor --- but the plot intriguing. The man has a fascination with sport utility vehicles (""...the powerful V6...""). Also, I know he did a lot of research on computers, but really --- almost everything electronic he mentioned could be done by any 13 year old today (I know, I live with one). So spare me the foreward..."
5,The Simple Truth,Once again DB writes a great book....while a little unbelievable in parts...it was very entertaining. I think I've read just about every one of his books and this certainly didn't let me down.
5,Total Control by David Baldacci,AS always David baldacci does not dissapoint. I look forward to reading or listening to all of his books. Especially like the Camel Club series.
2,Looooooong!!!!!,"I found the first half of this book to be incredibly boring. I almost stopped reading it,but, because I really like this authors work, I continued on --and on---and on. The second half of the book was better, lots of action, but it was really implausable. The end was so fast paced and so impossible that it was almost funny, a lot of super people running around offing each other. I thought it would never end!! I am a prolific reader and generally finish a book in two days, sometimes less, but this one was the exception. This bokk was certainly not bad, but it wasnt good either!!! When it comes to action, sometimes less is better than more."
1,DUMB WASTE OF TIME...,"I read about 80 books a year, and this one was a TOTAL WASTE of time. The main character, Sydney Archer, is a blonde dingbat. Simpering and helpless one moment, she's Wonder Woman the next, demonstrating unbelievable prowess. A really annoying character, one begins to hope that the bad guy wins. The book goes all over the map with complicated interactions among a host of characters, but none of it is credible. Don't waste your time. Baldacci must have needed the money to write something this bad."
1,Preposterous beyond all possible belief,"This book was completely ridiculous. I had trouble not ripping open the door of the plane I was on while reading it (over rural Virginia, I might add) and throwing this piece of garbage out, taking my chances with my own crash. There is not ONE major plot point that could actually occur - not ONE. Plastic characters, complete fakery, etc., etc., etc. So bad, so wrong, so sad."
1,Total Nonsense,"This can't be the same David Baldacci who wrote Absolute Power. Total Control is totally ridiculous ... a silly story line, cardboard characters, trite dialogue and phrases. I wasn't expecting one of the Great Books of the Western World, but even so, it was a disappointment. Now I'm afraid to read The Winner, which I bought before I read this stinker."
1,Could hardly wait until the end,"I thought I would never get to the end! I loved Absolute Power and couldn't wait to read this book! I'm familiar with computer technology and didn't even find that very interesting...I will try one more time with ""The Winner"" - then on to other authors!"
1,Don't bother,"Agree with most of the negative reviews. Baldacci's context is unbelievable and his word choices as contrived as they come. I can't believe this is the same guy who wrote Absolute Power. Moreover, I can't believe his editor still has a job. My recommendation is: don't bother."
1,Who would believe this tripe?,"Ok. I'm not a writer. Don't pretend to be. But, I AM a fairly intelligent reader. From the very beginning to the bitter end, this book was nothing but boilerplate fiction at its very worst. A ""plumper than she used to be"" corporate lawyer loses her husband in an airplane crash that also just happens to kill the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Then, in a plot with more twists and turns than a bad country road, she begins her fight to save his shaky reputation. The operative word is ""fight."" Who can believe that this middle-aged woman can ""kung fu"" with hired guns?The only other formula fiction that was this bad was the author's other incredible story, ""Absolute Power.""Oh, for an intelligent story, well-told. You won't find it here."
3,"Colorful, literally","Have you ever seen anyone with a blood red face? How about whiter than paper? Green? Couldn't help but note these descriptions in Baldacci's novel. His or her face occasionally ""reddened,"" ""went pale,"" ""reddened"", ""paled,"" ""was eggshell pale,"" ""white as a ghost,"" ""carried a red sheen,"" ""turned ashen,"" ""was red with anger,"" ""face flamed red,"" ""was a shade of white,"" ""turned a shade paler,"" ""was now blood red,"" ""flushed,"" ""turned whiter than paper,"" ""grew red,"" ""froze,"" ""went stone cold"", ""turned green."" Are these aliens Baldacci is dealing with? Aside from this, a readable book."
2,A light meal,"I sat down on a transatlantic flight recently and pulled out his book. And so did the woman sitting next to me. We both proceeded to plow through the thing. But the whole time, I kept asking why? Contrived and ridiculously implausible plot. Characters so thin they seem to lack substance entirely. I mean, a corporate lawyer-mom who can outmanouver an entire swat-team of bad guys? Come on! But, hey, it did the job. Before I knew it, we were home, and we'd both finished the damn thing."
3,A good holiday read!,"That is really all this book is. It seems to borrow heavily from other books I've read and there are some very obviuos parrallels between it and Grisham's latest ""The Partner"". That said it is an extremely well written books as one expects from Baldacci and will surely lead to a Hollywood movie. Which says something that this book is very readable and it is. It does not force the reader to think, to twist and turn in the night trying to decipher subtle plot changes. If you want frenetic plot twist read James Elroy if you want suspense try Graham Greene. The characters are somewhat stereotypical and shallow, the plot a little farfetched at times but if you want an undemanding holiday read then you could do an awful lot worse."
2,Trips up on his technology,"For someone who brags about his research (many discrepancies noted by other reviewers) Baldacci (or his editor) needs to try harder. I was particularly put off by the plane crash gaff, by instant on/off laptops, by a character rushing through airport security with a computer (having often been delayed proving that mine didn't contain a bomb), by the flawless operating of AOL. Most of all, thriller writers should spend time at a gun range and with other hands-on research of weapons. Baldacci might then know that semi-automatic pistols (better called ""auto loading"") do NOT fire on full automatic when the trigger is held and that the Winchester Defender, with its plastic stock, is hardly the battering ram Sydney makes of it. The author's omniscient viewpoint was downright annoying; with phone conversations particularly it is hard to tell the characters aren't face to face. Dialog ranged from TV script trite to legalese pretentious."
2,The conspiracy among us...,"About the only thing good about this book was it helped pass the time during a roundtrip flight between Dallas-Chicago. Otherwise, it was populated by the usual suspects: 1 lawyer who works for a high powered law firm that is dependent upon one client, a poorly paid G-man, and a powerful, corrupt executive (of a firm or a nation). He's like Grisham in that now that I've tried it, I won't return."
5,Just loved it! Can't wait for novel #3. A page turner!!!,"A wonderfully exciting book. I agree with some comments that the female doesn't have to cry every few chapters, but all in all, couldn't put it down. I don't know how David can surpass this and Absolute Power. I'm anxiously waiting for book number three. Good Luck - Daivd!"
3,"Good, but not as...","Absolute Power is definately a fantastic story line. The biggest problem facing John in this newest title is to top it. In my most humble opinion he does match it in story, but not in the character profiles. John Grisham and Koontz, lets also not forget Stephen King have a profound way of uniting their characters into your life. They are protrayed as real life people that jump out of the book. This book, Total Control lacks in this area which makes it continue to be somewhat shallow and unbelievable. It is good reading but don't expect to dream about it"
4,Great read,Relentless suspense. Though I would suggest in the future that Mr. Baldacci not have a female character that cannot help but succumb to crying every dozen or so pages. Also I would recommend that he do more weapons research. A Smith & Wesson SEMI-automatic pistol cannot fire on FULL AUTOMATIC
4,Im Impressed,I was very impressed with David Baldacci's second attempt to write a non-fiction novel. Total Control remained at a fast pace and really kept my attention. Though I must say that the rating probably would have been better if Baldacci left some of the computer junk out of it! Please feel free to e-mail me with your opinion on this novel and many mor
5,A Must Read!!!,"This book is an excellent written book. Baldacci grips you by the collar and doesn't let you go until the end. I was so intrigued with the technological aspect of the story. He has just the right amount of characters so the reader will not get confused. If you are in the mood for a fast paced, wonderfully written book then this is the one for you."
4,Total Control,"Fast moving, great characters, vintage Baldacci. Could not put the book down. Only downside (small one) at times it was hard to keep all the characters straight."
5,sensational,"Ths is an exciting book from cover to cover. Lots of fascinating intrigue.Characters are well defined. Lots of action, and very little blood & Gore"
5,Some fresh new patterns to choose from,"I was looking for more ""granny square"" patterns and came across this book and ordered it.It becomes hard finding ""fresh new"" patterns if you have picked up crochet books in the past. I was thrilled with many of the patterns in this book, since they were different from the ones I already had. It was just what I wanted; lots of lovely patterns so that I could make my own creative designed afghan.I would consider myself beyond a beginner in crochet, however not advanced, and the instructions of the squares I have made were easy and clear.I think this book is for anyone wanting to expand their square pattern library, and worth the money."
5,Louis L'Amour always gets a 5 star rating from me,This book is definitely a 5 star book. Louis L'Amour never gets less from me. The blend of history fact and novel adventure makes it an absolute winner.
2,Rivers West,"The setting takes place in louisiana purchase. The main character was a evil guy named Jean Talon. The story was a western story were the west was a open country. And a small town named louisiana purchase was getting takin over by a evil man namedjean Talon, that wants to take the town. And have it become his kingdom."

4,A great gift idea for anyone who loves pink!,"Got this for my teen daughter. She is a pink-a-holic and was so surprised that I found a pink tv that was 19"". It's a really cute tv and it has on screen displays of the little mermaid across the screen. The only thing I don't like is the color is a little off, it's sorta greenish hue. But for the price and look it is worth it. maybe it needs adjustment but I have not gotten in there yet to do it. I recommend this for anyone who loves pink!"
2,not worth the money,"Tastes are different, but for the price, I prefer the Wal-Mart brand sour gummy worms to these. And Wal-Mart's are cheaper."
4,The Stanley 56-204 4-Pound Jacketed Fiberglass Hammer,"I brought this Hammer sometime ago; it is very well made & or designed, and a good quality made Hammer etc."
5,"Readable, entertaining, compelling","I really enjoy this work. This book gets you thinking .. or not-thinking .. in new ways, opens your mind, and expands your conciousness. It's easy to read, fun, great stories and examples, and it's right on."
5,Capturing what is difficult to grasp,"Here is a Zen book that captures the difficult to grasp. Spicing his smooth and rapid flowing writing with historical antedotes from past masters, Steve Hagen draws us into a sequence of insights, towards awakening. We're not allowed to attach to thoughts, or to get caught up in a new thicket of views. And so when we put down the book, we're refreshed."
4,Great Read,This book is easy to read and brilliant in it's simplicity. I have read it no less than 8 times. It's just one of those that I can pick up any time to help settle my mind.
2,"All ""Wisdom,"" No ""Compassion.""","Buddhism is based on wisdom AND compassion. Mr. Hagen's new book, like his first book, ""Buddhism: Plain and Simple,"" does an excellent job in describing the ""wisdom"" component of Zen Buddhism. But just like in his first book, Mr. Hagen's new book is totally devoid of any discussion of the ""compassion"" component. Thus, this book makes Zen Buddhism seem like a purely intellectual excercise, devoid of any warmth or heart. Compare, for example, Mr. Hagen's books with anything written by ""Bhante G,"" Henepola Gunaratana. In his books, Bhante G makes (Theravada) Buddhism come alive with wisdom AND compassion. The tone of Bhante G's books is one of warmth, with a human face. Maybe that is why some are more attracted to Theravada Buddhism, and turned off by the abstractness of Zen (as Zen is portrayed by some, including Mr. Hagen)."
5,What Would Love Do?,"This inspirational book tells a very personal and insightful story about the evolution of Jyoti's deep spiritual journey across continents and cultures. Jyoti is the bridge between minds and hearts. What happens when Spirit calls a Shaman to service, and asks; What would love do? This book answers that question and is a glimpse of exciting material yet-to-come from the author. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent Album,One of the best CD's i've ever heard !!!!Excellent songs from one of the most creative bands.
5,Love it,"I love Skid Row and I wanted to see what I could find. Excellent Dvd. This is such a great band. I love to watch this dvd, great musicians, lyrics, and singing. I'm so glad that I found it and bought it. Also surprised to find Little Wing on this dvd with Scotti Hill yeah! Love these guys Sabo Hill Bolan Affuso and Bach"
2,ENOUGH ALREADY,"It's time to grow up and think about something new! The 80's are gone.Just like our big hair.Life is good almost 20 years later. It was fun,what I remember of it and today...?No regrets!Just some sweet memories. Have a nice day!Matt Fallon. Now of British Columbia"
2,A disappointment,"I am a Peggy Herring fan but this book was not only a disappointment it was annoying. The first 2/3s of the book was classic Peggy Herring. Nora and Darcy find young love in High School, are discovered and seperated to not see each other again for 30 years. Nora goes home to help her mother, who is a real character and reconnects with her delightful family and neighbors. Darcy goes home at the same time to help her crippled father and the two meet again. True love prevails (or so we think) and then the story falls apart with a crash. It is almost as though Ms Herring had committed to writing another 60 pages so she threw in every inane plot twist she could think of. I had to force myself to finish the book once I realized how bad it had become."
4,A Sizzling Performance for TV,"This is a neat release from a couple of angles; it is the Ramones on a 1978 promotional ""gig"" for German TV (call to a ""live"" music video, if you wish) and - from a historical perspective - a means to hear how bands would supplement tours with ""free"" performances to reach a larger audience.The 11 tracks clock in at 24 minutes, but the power and energy is nothing short of high-octane and is slightly less than one-half of the usual set the band would perform in concert. The music video for Rockaway Beach is also included.The Ramones only knew one speed to perform - no matter the venue - and this is a solid look at a band that never took a night off or shifted things into cruise control."
5,Golden Wisdom,"Harold Klemp's A Modern Prophet Answers Your Key Questions about Life is a treasury of simple but pure gold wisdom. If you love God and are willing to prove it, this book gives you the tools to make your life happy, powerful and wise."
3,instructions could be better,"this video shows various shag patterns from the basic to more intermediate patterns. although the young couple seem to be very good dancer's, they still have some development to go before becoming great instructors on video. i assume this to be based on the instructions given from the people at the DanceStore. All their video's have the same basic format....showing many patterns and just the pattern count. this would have been a great video to learn from if time was taken to explain (break down) the steps, the count, the timing, and most importantly the lead. i have many years dancing triple time eastcoast in a fashion similar to shag and therefore was able to understand and preform many of the patterns. i think for someone with out some experience dancing, this video would be somewhat difficult to understand the intermediate patterns as presented."
5,INTERESTING,MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS DVD AND HAS LOOKED AT ALL OF THE SERIES. SHE LOVESFASHION AND WANTS TO GO TO FIDM.
1,DON'T THROW AWAY THE BOX IT COMES IN INCASE YOU HAVE TO SEND IT BACK,"I bought this because I started watching Season 2 and wanted to see Season 1. Unfortunatly it was defective. It was missing 2 episodes. Also clicking on ""PLAY ALL"" at the menu caused my dvd freeze. So I had to scroll through all the episodes one by one. I was able to send it back for a refund, so problem solved. They probably aren't all defective, but mine can't be the only one. Returning it was such a hassel its probably not worth buying it online. Go for some where in town where you can return it without printing out pages, filling out pages, repackaging it (I threw away the box it came in - so I had to buy a box), mailing it back, waiting 2 weeks for a refund,etc."
2,Project Runway stupidity!,"I have almost all of the other seasons. So I had to have the first. Right? Not! It was the worst of the bunch. Most of the designers couldn't design their way out of a paper bag. And, they didn't even consider people had to wear that @$%^."
4,What a wonderful creation!,"It is thrilling to watch the show. Such a creative idea from the producers. Lot of creativity and innovation have been packed within such a limited period of time with stringent restrictions. Some of contestants have strong personalities. Some did create marvellous pieces of clothing. A big fashion fan like me, I feel drawn to watch the whole programme, to find out who is going to be the winner of the competition."
4,Pamper your Pooch,"This illustrated book will give you ten of ideas on how to make coats for your dog, how to make beds and houses for them, necklaces, how to create a card for their birthday and much much more. Step by step projects, are easy to make using not only the patterns from this book, but also your imagination. It shows how to give your dog a bath, nail cut, brush. There are pages with doggy recipes for a special occasion or for every day cooking (they are delicious; I tried them!). It even has horoscope with details on every one, matching personalities, favorite color etc. It's really fun!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting an actual curriculum, however, what I got was a skinny ""booklet"" about grief and children. Some may enjoy, but not what I was looking for."
5,Excellent resource for gamers AND writers.,"This is quite possibly the best RPG supplement I've ever come across. Ever!Well-written and logically laid-out, with more than enough to detail to spur the imagination in a million directions, but not so much that it constricts it. For DM/GMs, this is an invaluable resource for creating realistic, vibrant city-based campaigns that your players will love. For writers - particularly fantasy writers, natch - this is a MUST-HAVE for developing living, breathing cities that your readers will return to again and again.[NOTE: The red cover seems to be from an earlier edition entitled Citycraft. This review applies to City Works, the blue-covered 2003 edition.]"
1,Poor customer Service. Terrible product,"I purchased this drive for its security features and it was a big mistake. Software did not work so I contacted Iomega support. After 20 minutes of 'try this', 'try that' and 'try another computer' the end result was the same as the issue. Imoega promised to replace the drive if I return the defective drive. It has been over a month since Iomega received my damaged drive (sent via registered mail) and I still do not have my replacement. I keep getting the run around. Do not purchase this product unless you are a masochist that loves when a company runs all over you with lies. Whatever happend to the Iomega I once liked?"
1,Don't wate your money,Don't waste your money on this set....complete garbage! The holes were filled in on 3 of the 7 bits rendering them useless for the purpose for which they were designed. I ended up tossing the complete set in the trash...I know junk when I see it. Save your money and look for a higher quality set. I did give one star for the super fast shipping....
5,Good quality,"So the designers who build the stuff that we buy want to keep us out of the innards, so first they come up with the torx drive, which at the time nobody could remove, until torx drivers became widely available on the market. So then they stuck a ##### little stem in the middle of the screw and called it a ""tamper-resistant"" (TR), which is a snide put-down of us do-it-your-selfers (old-fashioned term for ""hacker""). They're going to keep me from ""tampering"" with my own property!They shoulda known, now the TR version of torx is available on world-wide Amazon. Next I expect that they will devise a torx screw that will spit black ink in your face when you ""tamper"" with it.So, review-wise, this is a very basic product, good quality, and the orange rubber holder is a convenient means of keeping the parts together."
5,Now I can change the lightbulb!,"The lightbulb burned out in my microwave. The microwave worked fine but there was no way to replace the bulb! We had to take the cover off on one side. (nowhere near the microwave parts, just the button panel.) The torx bits worked perfectly. Cost us a little over $9 to including the bulb. Better than buying a whole new microwave to replace a lightbulb!"
1,7 pc. Torx Driver Security Bit Set T 10 to T40,Worthless junk. The holes in the center of the bits are too small for thepin in a standard security screw.
1,Product was not usable!,Torx driver was security type. There was as designed - suppose to be a security hole in the center andall center holes were cast off center making them no good.I notified Amazon. Amazon notified the shipper/supplier. My account was credited for the expense all within minutes.I am still with out the needed order but I am satisfied with the way I was handled with the wholeexperienceThank YouMilton
1,Poor,"The driver heads stripped and fell apart within the first 2 minutes of use, and also destroyed the screw heads. Don't buy."
2,Not happy with my SONY B16,I used this recorder for 2 classes on the same day (approximately 2 hours long each) and it recorded ok. It picks up lots of background noise but you can still hear the instructor. When I tried to playback what I recorded the batteries flashed low and I had to buy new ones. I would not recommend this to anyone. The only benefit to this was that you don't need to buy/use microcassettes.
1,"No USB port or off-button, and battery pannel is flimsy","When I bought this item I didn't notice it doesn't have a USB port; I thought all digital voice recorders have a USB port to transfer recordings to a computer for storage. Without a USB port, devices like these are almost useless. The battery panel is flimsy and does not create a tight fit when the batteries are in place. There is no ""off button"". I will be returning this item."
4,Pretty good,"This recorder is pretty good, I got it half the retail price. It's compact and works well, if only it had a third, higher quality recording mode it would be perfect."
3,You get what you pay for,"My biggest complaint about this product is the sound quality. For a Sony product, I was really disappointed. In order to get clear sound quality, you have to place the recorder down near whatever you are recording, as is right on top of it. If the recorder is any distance away or held, forget it. Remember the Charlie Brown cartoons when his teacher would talk? That about sums it up. Also a lot of feedback noise. Another downside to the product is there is no On/Off switch. Granted, mine didn't come with the users manual, but after playing with it, there is clearly no switch for it. If you're looking for a recorder with clear sound quality, by pass this model."
2,Bad sound is reason for 2 stars.,"Music in this double cd is good, but no the best.Best music which King Oliver ever recorded is on Complete set double Cd.But this Cd is not good for me for other reason. This is poor sound quality.For me this Cd is unlistanable for false sound reflection.I prefer real sound on complete set and my recommendation is don't buy this Cd, buy Complete set."
2,A good door-stop,"I'm not sure what attracts some players to these orphans of chess. Maybe they like to lose or are intentionally delaying their development as players. If you insist on playing garbage, this might be the book for you. If you, like the rest of us, have to face garbage on a regular basis, get Schiller's (with Watson), Big Book of Busts. It is excellent and will supply you with decent lines against all the weird and/or unsound openings out there. If you've already bought this one, don't despair -- it'll make a good doorstop and it can always be recycled..."
3,Not as I expected,"When I got this book I thought it would be like another of his books I've got: Who's Afraid of the King's Gambit. It turns out that I was wrong. I like that there's so many openings and variations, but I noticed SEVERAL mistakes that sometimes made it hard to understand. I couldn't decide to rate it 3 or 4 stars, but I picked 3 because I was hoping for more diagrams. If I could I'd rate it 3 1/2 stars, but..."
4,Good album,"Man or Astro-man? has been making great surf rock records for years, and this one is no exception. It doesn't break any new ground, but it is quality stuff and well worth the money."
2,"comme ci, comme ca","Plain and simple, this is repetitious, garden-variety surf music, and nothing more, done better by many others old and new.Man Or AstroMan are nothing more than a novelty act with removable cogs; the band has changed personnel countless times, yet the sound remains the same.There is very little variety in choice of keys (usually E or A-minor), little variety in tempo, and plenty of empty schtick; occasional sound effects, movie snippets, etc.A better alternative might be Shadowy Men From a Shadowy Planet, a Canadian trio who are able to play the field alot better in the rock instrumental field, with more competent musicianship.Granted, Man or AstroMan are not about musicianship; then again, they aren't about much of anything."
3,Decent but overpriced,"I only use the pen for looking up words in the dictionary and pronouncing them. The pen feels a bit overpriced for that use. Also, it freezes every once in a while and I have to pull out the batteries to reset it. At first, scanning is difficult. However, once I got used to it, I could scan most words on the first try. I have it next to my bed so when I read at night it comes in handy. I don't particularly like the user interface. They should take some hints from Apple."
3,DOes not recognize handwriting.,"It recognizes typed writing, but not handwriting. It is a waste of money. It is more trouble than it is worth and we tried several different people's handwriting. Use this if you are a student and need it to take notes on text....not good if you are trying to get it to read journals, like I was."
2,Yes it is that bad....,"This would be a great idea if it worked. Let me first start off with the good things. It copies text that's on a flat piece of paper pretty well, as long as you keep your nerves and make sure you keep the angle right. Now for the negatives. Say for instance you need to copy text from a book, that's gonna be a problem. A book isn't absolutely flat when you open it up, it has that lump in the middle,...there goes your angle, and lots of errors. So for the students who are thinking of getting this, DON'T. It will drive you crazy. The post before stated that you might not get the expected results if you zoom across the text like a fiend on coffee, well even if you're a zen buddhist monk, you might not be able to keep your hand steady with this thing. Overall, i think this product is a waste of money, and the people who are raving about it,...well they just seem to enthusiastic, they sort of sound like paid commercials. Read all the reviews and make your decision."
1,USB doesn't work,"I tried the CD to install the USB connection between pen and PC.Failed so many times. I tried for one month, I decided to return it. And I hope I still can get full refund."
1,this was thebiggest waste of my money this year,This product sucked-I kick my self each time I think about how stupied I was to purchase
1,wizcom quicklink elite pen scannner,"Have to have it and use it to write a review, Don't you think;Sorry"
2,"Too Much ""Fix-It/do it over"" Involved in use!","I returned this item..write ups were good on it, I tried it over a period of 3 days & it Never copied entire text, left out entire lines & paragraphs. A lot of the words could not be understood by the pen (some of them easy words) so it just pops out jumbled letters. You can go back & repair the screwed up text but takes way too much time. It was easy to use as stated in their write ups."
2,Not Pucho's Best,"Henry Lee ""Pucho"" Brown was prolific in the '90s, releasing about 5 CDs of newly recorded material. This one suffers from poor choices of covers (i.e.""Mission Impossible"")and generally uninspired playing."
4,Baffled by previous review,"This actually is one of the more important Pucho recordings to own, though admittedly it is a bit free and varied in its content. I suppose some would consider that a weakness, but I see it as one of this albums' strengths. With guest artists like Joe Locke on vibes, the album breaks free of convention. No, it is not Pucho's best album. That honor belongs to Rip a Dip. Notwithstanding, the album certainly does not deserve the paltry criticism the previous reviewer leveled against the album. I consider this to be an essential addition to anyone's Pucho collection."
2,Another part time musician with some money?,"He's collaborated with some musicians from my personal library, he has a very nice website, he plays lots of shows, so why isn't this CD better? Forget the hoopla, he must have another one of those devoted band girlfriends working hard to make him look good."
1,junk,the phone holder will not stay on the vent. everytime i move the phone the holder falls on the floor. i didn't realize the front display on my phone would be blocked due to the way the holder is made.don't waste your time and money
3,Not quite right for me.,"While I imagine that this bra has a lot of potential, it's not quite the one for me. I don't have a store that sells my size nearby so I didn't get to try it on before I purchased it, but if you do I recommend doing so. It ran a little tight on the band size, and though I filled the cups they still seemed to pucker in places. I also didn't realize that the cups were unlined and have pretty obvious seams, and did not like the slightly pointed shape. That being said, it did reduce size and control movement. This bra will work wonders if it fits you and you like the way it looks."
5,"NUTRITIOUS, DELICIOUS TACOS","I have Fibromyalgia and need to eat healthier as well as add more spices & herbs to my diet!I used PACE seasoning with Casa Fiesta Jumbo Taco Shells.However, since I am adjusting to eating more spices, I used 1 and a half pounds of ground beef.The tacos were delicious! ..... My family also loved them!They are very hard to please especially since trying to incorporate more nutritious meals!Definitely a keeper!Casa Fiesta Large Taco Shells, 6.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)"
4,A Fine Police-Procedural Novel,"This is author Caunitz's shortest book and that is my only complaint. He does not write ""mysteries"" in the classic sense; he writes police-procedural novels. You get the salty cop dialogue, an authentic inside look at what a cop's life is like, and all of the political, criminal, and hectic details - since the author is a former NYPD lieutenant. If you want a read ""with the bark off"" and enjoy hearing what a cop's life is REALLY like, you will enjoy this book immensely. If you are looking for something clever and Sherlockian, this isn't it. I love Caunitz's stories and reread them every once in a while."
3,"Your Typical ""Bad Cop Solves The Crime"" Novel","I enjoyed the tactics used by these cops to solve their case, but I never really felt any sense of mystery or suspense. It's easy to read, it passes the time, and it's not bad... but it's not that exciting either."
2,A weak Police Novel!,"""Exceptional Clearence"" is a book with no outstandings qualities. There's no great detective work or a gripping and interesting mystery to solve. The characters are poorly developed and I remember Ed Mc Bain's 87 Precint novels as a good example of how to built a convincing and weel structured police novel. Caunitz has too much to learn in this way before reaches a respectable position among the great police writers, like Mc Bain, Chandler and others."
3,memorable and touching,"When I watched this film, I thought it was just so-so. Yet, there was something about the characters that I can't forget 13 years later. The lonely quiet man who murdered his loud wife is a character I can't get out of my mind. Despite his horrible crime, I still felt some sympathy for him. I found the bumbling Peter Sellers character amusing as the defense barrister.If you're a fan of Rumpole, I'd give this a try; as John Mortimer wrote the screenplay."
2,Alarmingly weak,"How can a film with two such splendid actors, at the peak of their careers, be so lousy? I blame writer John Mortimer, who conceived this extraordinarily weak script. There is no humor, only a trace of whimsy. The dialogue goes on and on; no one is convincing, nothing is enlightening. The flashback scenes are particularly awkward. One is always aware that you are watching a play, and a bad play it was. Sellers and Attenborough must have been a paid a bundle to participate in this flop."
3,It's Hard To Travel Lighter Than This,"The small book devotes two pages each to about three dozen authors, spiritual seekers and fictional characters. One page briefly describes the person and something about their life and philosophy; the second provides a supposedly complete list of the small number of items each person lived with or took on a trip. It's thought provoking as to how much - or how little - stuff we really need to live a good life. At the same time it's a VERY brief book that can be read in about 30 minutes. Because there is a bibliography listing one or more sources for or about each person this book might best be considered an introduction/reference for those wanting to study the philosophy of simplicity. It's also a good inspirational gift for someone who wants to simplify their life. Too bad publishers don't provide little books like this for a more reasonable price."
3,Not as much meat as I'd hoped,"This was a little bit of a disappointment. Not much to get your teeth into, or to inspire a reader."
4,A Feast of Fast,"Anybody fascinated with going fast on two wheels will find it hard not to like this book. The Fastest Motorcycles on Earth is essentially a history, focusing primarily the period from 1960 onward. In addition to an awesome collection of period photos (lots of color) that you probably won't see in any other book, the writer's folksy style gives the whole book a sort of ""behind-the-scenes"" authentic feel to describing what it's like to go out and try to set a Land Speed Record from the point of view of the guys who've actually done it. Be careful, though...there's enough ""how-it's-done"" detail in this book that you might be tempted to sell the house and start building your own LSR bike..."
4,This book delivers what it promises,"The title of the book says it all. This book is a very good account of the men and machines that have attained the goal of fastest motorycle. From the early days, Bert Le Vack and Brough, Ernst Henne and BMW, through William Herz and NSU, all the way to the streamliners of Triumph, Don Vesco, and Harley-Davidsons, there is a wealth of information and photographs. You really get a feel for the dedication and effort involved in building a machine capable of going over 300 MPH, pushing tires and engines up to and past their limits. The day by day account of the setting of the current record, by Dave Campos and the EasyRiders HD in 1990, is a wonderful climax to the story. 16 days of runs, crashes, worn out tires, transmission overhauls, engine swaps; even the nitrous powered push truck burned a hole in a piston. A most welcome addition to any motorcycle or land speed enthusiast's library."
5,This book is a must have for any Woody Allen fan!!!,"I am one of the interviewees in this book; I had a copy of this book when it was published, but over the years, it vanished. I just replaced it on Amazon, and I'm so glad I did. I had actually forgotten some of my dream, told to the author on audio tape. It was many, many years ago. I was astounded at the time that I was not the only person who dreamed about Woody. It's an interesting look into the unconscious of a wide variety of people, and anyone who is a fan of Woody's will enjoy reading it."
4,Only for no limit fans,NO LIMIT swamped 1998 with rappers and bands putting out 1 LP and then leaving the label.this is not bad and i believe THEIR IS A SINGLE WHICH I CANNOT FIND ANYWHERE.
4,Bomb cd!,"Ok I listened to this more thoroughly and I decided that it deserves 4 stars. The songs are very sexy and romantic and it's a great cd for any smooth R&B fan! I gave this 4 stars only because the song Make Luv To A Thug is weak and also there aren't enough songs. Whenever I listen to this, it reminds me of the girl I love. Kelly, I don't know if you love me or not, but if you ever, for some reason, happen to stumble upon this review and read it, I just want you to know that I love you with all my heart and you are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my entire life. I don't know if you feel the same way, but I hope you do.Love, Drewski Dogg Da Ice Cream Man"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY,"JIVE HAS DONE IT AGAIN, BY BRINGING OUT MORE SLOPPED UP GOODIES FOR YOUR LISTENING DISPLEASURE. IF I COULD GIVE THIS CD A NEGATIVE 5 STAR I WOULD, TO ALL THE CONSUMERS OUT THERE, BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR JIVE PRESENTS: UGK GREATEST HITS, ITS JUST AS BAD AND DISTORTED. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO SCREW MUSIC FOR MANY YEARS AND WHAT A ALBUM LIKE THIS IS BASICALLY DOING IS DESTROYING THE ART FORM, BAD ENOUGH VINYL IS BEING REPLACED BY CRAP LIKE FINAL SCRATCH AND CD-DJ BANDITS. CONSUMERS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
2,Tedious Reading,"A main character gets a crush upon a missing person immediately upon viewing his portrait. No -- it's not a juvenile romance, but a purported legal thriller (although ""thriller"" is not an apt term for this tedious plodder). I love to read mysteries that develop the main characters/investigators, but not at the expense of the mystery and story itself. Unfortunately, this book does not succeed in balancing characterization with plot. The plot is not compelling; I never had difficulty putting the book down. And even the characterization fails, relying on artifice (the nun's voice) and stilted dialogue. I am giving the book two stars instead of one simply because I did appreciate the description of the pre- and post-trial processes."
4,Good Summary of Clive's Work - But Beware Editorial Description!,"This is a well-compiled group of Clive Gregson solo tunes from his first solo album in 1985 through the most-recent ""Long Story Short"". Unlike the amazon.com editorial description, this is NOT a compilation of Clive/Christine material - that's another CD. This one is a nicely remastered collection of Clive tunes, some of which have been re-recorded or completely re-mixed. If you're a Clive completist (which I am), this is a must buy. If not, it isn't a bad place to start with this sublime singer-songwriter who's played to a small (but rabid) fanbase for far too long."
5,great,"I have the Lp from when it first came out,its a great record.Also don't forget west view dance land [ MAD MIKE DANCES ]"
1,OK for $19.95 but not a $100 jacket,"To be honest, I was enticed by the thought of owning a $100 jacket for $19.95. Unfortunately, jackets of this quality are available at Wal-Mart for less than $20.00 and I passed on them.I don't find this jacket to be very well designed. To protect against rain, you had better be sure and keep the hood on tight. Otherwise, the fuzzy fabric lining the hood gets drenched. But put the hood on and your hair is going to stand on end for the rest of the day because of the static the lining creates. Leave the hood off and it looks pretty unflattering as it doesn't hang neatly against your back. Wish I had passed on this one."
5,One of the best,"Definitely up there with Satta. It's mostly remixed Satta tracks, which is awesome. I found this for $20 and it is well worth the purchase.I first found out about Boozoo Bajou when I heard Joe Dukie from Fat Freddys Drop sing on one of their tracks. Been following them ever since.Do pick this one up!!"
4,"Lightweight, general purpose 7x35","I was looking for a general purpose 7x35 binocular for camping and birdwatching. The Olympus DPS 1 was one of the lighter offerings in that power,important for me in carrying them on a hike. I like the ""grippy"" texture of the binoculars. The case is lightweight and has a decent strap on it. One small gripe are the four lens caps,somewhat loose fitting,however they really are not needed when carrying the binoculars in the case, I just leave them at home. Great quality for a reasonable price."
4,I'm glad to have my Olympus Binocs.,"In 2001 I bought virtually identical Olympus Binoculars and they were perfect for me. A couple of months ago I dropped them on my garage floor and that knocked them out of allignment.Olympus offered to replace them at no charge if I would send them in with my original receipt. Unfortunately, I no longer had the receipt, so I replaced them with this purchase.So far the new set is working well for me."
2,Too bulky,I bought these based on a review of someone who took these to Alaska. These are to bulky & heavy to lug around in the great outdoors so I returned all 3 pairs I bought. I found a smaller pair by Bushnell that works very well at Dicks for the same price.
4,Intelligence in nature- Narby,"highly recommended. this is an easy read which makes several striking points. It is quite different than his previous book, the Cosmic Serpent which is a little more academic. But Narby captures the same essence here with objective examples from the most recent research on a variety of topics. very good, the only reason it is not a 5 is because it is fairly brief. I found the footnotes to be a regirgitation of the text. I was eager to read this book because his previous one was great. But Intelligence in Nature is more of a one-two punch than a 10 round bout. But it is a potent one-two, I'd say Tyson just a little bit after his prime."
4,Very Interesting Stuff,"I give this a four because this book didn't make me go a little crazy like Narby's last book. This is also a good thing. Narby asks questions and realizes that there aren't any concrete answers. It makes me look at my cat and think, ""She's onto something with her animal ways."" Narby presents a lot of research in a pretty understandable format and backs it all up with his sources- this is good. He also faces his critics, which is interesting. This is no ""Cosmic Serpent""- but I expect this book was better received because it was low key. A very enjoyable read and I hope to see more works by him soon."
4,A Good Supplement to Narby's The Cosmic Serpent,"I was not as impressed with Narby's second book on intelligence in nature, but I found it to be good supplementary material to his first book. As always, Jeremy Narby leaves a plethora of notes at the end of his book for further research (nearly half the book), which I am certain the reader will find useful."
3,Half a book,Half of this book is the actual book. The other half are end notes that are 'supposed' to be good reading. Did not care for the large amount of quoted material coupled with the author's travels.
1,Smoke and Mirrors,"Beware!! This coin is looks good on the one side, but have you ever seen the other side? There is a good reason you only see the one side and that reason helps the seller, but deceives the buyer. Side 2 is horrible looking, I thought when I bought this product that the other side was going to look like the front, but it doesn't. Since my bad purchase I have found better card guards out there that have both sides finished and are much higher quality. Just do your shopping and you will be glad you did. There are some other websites that I have bought from that have a much superior product and better prices."
1,Don't WASTE your money,"As they say, you get what you pay for. Want to know why this is so inexpensive? Because it is a totally worthless record player, which will damage your precious vinyl and which moves at an irregular speed making your vinyl sound bad. If you don't care about the turntable, then the rest is JUST OKAY. If you want it only for a display piece, then I suppose it's nice looking. I would not recommend it, however."
1,Don't Buy IT!!!,"Initially, the player worked fine. It has an okay sound, nostalgic if you will. Two weeks after I bought it, the turntable is broken and I am returning it. The radio and cd player work okay though. I sent an email to the company and NEVER received a reply."
4,You get what you pay for.,"This is an overall good product. And to get all these features in one little package for this price its hard to expect perfection. My only complaint was that the plastic window on the tape deck is coming off, its just a stick-on."
2,If only it worked!,"I really like the way this system looks. I bought a $99 Crosley player at a local store, and this unit is much nicer in all ways- except IT DOES NOT WORK! I am on my SECOND UNIT at this point. Both have had bad DVD players. With the first one I made the mistake of putting it together before I tried it. This time I just got out the player part and immediately discovered I was in for another return. As much as I would like to keep this beautiful stereo system, I can't trust a company that has sent two bad units and only has a 90 day warranty. Too bad."
3,old timer,"i was looking forward to my new compact stereo, but the craftmanship is fair ,the first one was not working properly, a challenge to repack and send it back, the second one came on time, thanks to the good service of amazone.com,my first time to by on line, a great place to shop.the control buttons dont allway work,on the cd,the assembling of the base is to difficult special if the holes dont match for the legs we had to make new one, the sound is ok for a wooden boom box,at least i get to play my old records, and going down memory lane, thank you."
3,Nostalgic or just garbage,"this product looks great it sounds nice but the c.d. player sucks, I already spend 17 dollars with shipping on a new needle that it didn't come with. I called to get it replaced at no charge the company laughed and denied my help. anyways the product is great its a shame you really cant use the c.d. player much. also the radio doesn't tune as well as i wanted it to. overall the nostalgic is what you get when you get ripped off."
3,It's OK!,"Not the best sound for the stereo minded! Looks nice, but after using it for over a year it malfunctioned and DVD's start and stop right in the middle of a song. Tried changing DVD's and ran a cleaner through it but it still stops and goes. Don't waste your money on this one just for looks and buy a really good stereo system. AM/FM tuner is ok. I bought this for looks and record player in the top part. Next time I will get a really good stereo."
3,Stereo System,One of the 3 cd trays doesn't work. Otherwise it's great to be able to play old records and tapes.
4,"Good poems, great translation","This translation is very readable. The notes are always very interesting and help the text come alive. Red Pine has really provided a lot of value through them - without them, some of the poems could be very obscure. It is rare to find a translation of the complete works of a Chinese poet: most books only present a selection. If one takes the time to read the complete oevre, however, the author comes alive in a different way - you begin to recognize certain recurring moods and themes; in the end, you feel you have learnt something about the things that concerned him, and come closer as a result.The only criticism is that Red Pine uses a personal transliteration that is neither pinyin nor Wade-Giles; as a result, it is often hard to be sure of the identity of people and places he mentions."
1,Ouch! Not worth it!,"I tried this product instead of the more expensive options out there. I realized that comfort is worth the extra money. I tried it on for only a few minutes with my 28 pound son and my shoulders felt like they were going to fall off. Not enough shoulder support. I was so glad this happened in the first few moments and not after a hike. I immediately made plans to return this item (which is wonderfully easy with Amazon). Everything seemed to fit fine other than that, I am 5'5"" tall, medium built woman in relatively good shape. Thank goodness for EBAY, I was able to get a used, better supporting pack for cheap. Maybe a lighter child would fare better in this pack."
1,"No comfort, and rear legs broken","First day out of the box, The instruction (what there is of them) said ""just pull on the legs to stand it up, well they broke and one side locked in and the other side locked out. which made the stand up frame worthless.Also, for a 20lbs 11 month baby, the back was very unconfortable on the shoulders, I thought maybe it was me, so I had the wife try it, and she hated it more.We took it back"
4,good,"did the trick, went hiking and was very comfortable with a big one year old on my back. it worked out well and did the job. little pricey though"
4,A savior for my chores,Pros: Both my baby and I loved it. I was able to do a lot of chores at home eg lawn mowing cleaning as well as walking. My baby wants to be around me and without this carrier she would not have let me to leave her Alone for the choresI love the shade and the wind protectorCons: max baby's weight 35 while there are other carriers with max capacity of 45 or moreI started having a knee pain after using it I have had one course of anti inflammatory meds which helpedBuy pain recurred once I used it again. then another course of meds and stopped using it and so far no painI am not a hiker maybe but quite athletic. Maybe I should not using it for long periods of timeJust be aware of your body limitsThe baby safety straps are a little difficult to undo and take the fussy baby out quickly. Not enough space to play with it but after a while I learned the trick but due to the difficulty I only used one set of straps vs two
3,Heavy and uncomfortable!,"This product, is not ideal for shorter or more petite moms. I am 5' 108 lbs. This was very bulky and heavy, impossible to wear for more than 15mins. Otherwise, my husband who is 6' and 180lbs also said it was very uncomfortable. It is well made, but not practical."
5,The best!!,We love this baby backpack. My baby girl goes so comfortable in it and is so easy to put on. We use it to go everywhere....no complains!!!
1,Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money with this carrier,"As soon as I got this carrier I started to love it, I bought it because I am leaving the country and where I am heading there will be a lot of hiking opportunities. I was really happy with my purchase. I decided that it would be good to try it before I leave and when I got it out of the box I realized the buckle for the strap that goes around the waist was broken. Not a big deal I thought!. I contacted the seller and they said they would happily refund $4 for the inconvenience... I regretted so much buying this cheap carrier. I wish I just went to the closest REI Store to get one so I didn't have to deal with such a poor customer service. I don't know how they figure $4 would do me any good..."
5,Awesome,Bought this to replace using a stroller while walking the city in the winter. The cover kept our 1 year old warm while she was still able to look around from a better view. I highly recommend this product. It was comfortable to wear too.
4,"Eh, good, but not the best.","Good value for price. But only holds up to 40 pounds. My 14 month old is almost 40 pounds. We were hoping to use this longer, but I had to sell it because he was too big.Other than that, good quality. Lots of padding, feels comfortable, convenient to fold and use."
4,Good item for the price,"I have been happy with this item. My kid doesn't love it, because he's always rather be running wild. But he doesn't complain about this backpack. He is comfortable in it. We've been able to enjoy hiking again because he will actually sit in this one. We've tried others where he just complains and wants out. He is happy in this one.It is a little small for me, 6'1"" guy. But the straps are adjustable enough that we've made it work. For the amount we actually use it, it has been great for us. We couldn't justify spending a lot of money on this because we wouldn't use it too often. But it's very handy to have when it's needed, and we have been happy with it for what we paid."
3,"Wanted to like, but...","I found this backpack secondhand and couldn't pass it up. Our child loves her old backpack carrier, but she is getting to big for it. I thought we had struck it lucky when we found this. After some extended wearing, I find that that is not true...PROS:Extremely well-builtLight weightsecures babybackpack carries A LOT (when properly packed)can attach small toy for baby's amusementCONS:HOTToo long for smaller individuals (5'2 and the support rests too far down)Puts all of the weight on your shouldersUncomfortable for wearerI gave this product 3 stars because this carrier works for Daddy. He is a very large man (7'1) and this backpack easily accommodates him and Baby. I, however, did not have as much success and will be using our old carrier from the 1980s until we find an alternative."
4,Pretty good,"I gave it a 4 of 5. I like it its comfy and affordable. The only thing is the top strap is made to ride very high on your chest and if you connect both the top chest strap and also the lower waist strap, it will reveal all of your fatness. Which is why on the picture of the product, a very, very skinny guy has the backpack strapped on. The good news for the rest of us out there is that you don't even need to strap either of these on. I use it just like a regular backpack and it works out fantastic!! The reason it wasn't 5 of 5 was the inability to move the chest strap up or down."
3,Decent construction but hurt our backs,"The backpack itself is fine, decent construction, fairly lightweight, and easy to use. However it hurt both mine and my wife's backs rather quickly. I'm 6'4"" and it just sat too high on my back and caused me back pain after only a few hundreds yards of walking. My wife is 5'5"" and she also felt that it was too high on her back and with the baby in the backpack it hurt her back immediately. The quality of the product was fine, but I feel it was made for very short people."
1,uncomfortable,I got this backpack as a gift. It is the most uncomfortable backpack. All of the weight goes on your shoulders. It doesn't rest on your hips like it is suppose too. Worst backpack ever!
1,Uncomfortable,"Disappointed with this product. The chest strap is too high and both my husbands and my shoulders are killing us within minutes of carrying our baby in the pack. (I am 5' and he's almost 6')There isn't much padding on the waist straps either. I did like the rain shield and we used it some in winter just to keep the baby warm. I wouldn't recommend this pack, we're buying a different one for longer hikes this summer."
3,Not a good buy if you are thin,"The only thing this packpack was lacking, for me, was padding. I am a fairly thin person and there just wasn't enough on me and the backpack to prevent some areas of discomfort...mainly my lower back and clavicle. My husband (who has more padding) said it felt fine to him.The construction and durability of the backpack was great and the rain cover is an nice feature. When I put my boy in it, I felt confident that he was safe, secure and comfortable.It is a great backpack for those who have a bit more to love around the middle."
2,Disappointed,"My daughter is 1 and outgrowing the Baby Bjorn (which she still loves), so I wanted to get a backpack carrier to carry her without killing by back and shoulders. The Chicco backpack got mostly good reviews, and others seemed to say that it is comfortable, so I purchased it. I could not wear this for more than 15 minutes without my shoulders and back killing me! My husband tried it too and had the same reaction. Those who think this is comfortable must have shoulders of steel! I can't imagine going for a hike wearing this enormous contraption. Unfortunately we are returning this item, and will stick with the Bjorn for now."
1,Very disappointed,"I liked that most reviews were positive. I tried it and after 10 minutes my back was killing me. Very poor ergonomic design. No matter how tightly I pulled the shoulder straps, the so called padded back would not come in contact with my shoulder blades. The entire weight was sitting on my sacral bone, actually cutting in, not very well padded at the bottom. I had to lean forward to try counterbalance the weight, which causes a lot of strain on the lower back. Too many straps, way too complicated. I am no wimp I can carry the Baby Bjorn with my 16 lbs daughter for 2 hours without any difficulty. I bought this so I can take her for longer hikes. This was a total failure. I returned it the next day. On the positive note, my daughter enjoyed the ride, she even fell asleep. I will try the kokopax next, it looks way simpler."
4,Great baby backpack,"I bought this for my 11 month old since he couldn't fit in the snuggly anymore. This is a great backpack - it was uncomfortable at first, but the more you wear it the more used to it you get. My baby goes in here when I have to do housework and I can't leave him alone. He falls asleep in it all the time. I also took it to a trip in WY and it was great to put him in there while we were on the farm."
5,backpack,"This backpack exceeded my expactations in every way. Easy put together, staps are very comfortable, price was affordable, and my 7 month-year-old loves being as high up as Daddy. Great buy for men, for women one must have some exercise experience in order for this product to be comfortable. For petite women this might be to much to handle, remember your babies weight + 6 pounds. I'm 5' 10"" and 180pds and no problems for a walk in the beach sand for 2 miles."
4,Pretty Good Book!!!,I was plesantly surprised when I read this.The Book is in the form of letters. The first set are from an Alien visiting Earth around 2 thousand years ago.The second set are e-mails between cousins.I wasn't sure how both correspondences fit togather but Donnelly's storyline brought them togather effortlessly.I was a little hesitant about the writing style but it really worked for this book.I kept eagerly reading each letter to see where he was going with it.Very good read.
5,Completely Different,"'Letters from the Flesh' is the most different SF novel I've read in years. It is full of surprises, and I'm still thinking about it months after reading it. For me, these are very good things."
4,A Nice FInd,"I stumbled across Mainstay rather by accident, first hearing the title song ""Becoming Who You Are,"" and was blown away by the lead vocals. Really, really great vocalist here! I own this album and also recently saw this band live on tour with Jeremy Camp. They were great live and the lead vocals held up, too, which is often not the case when you get around to seeing a band perform live. My husband, having heard nothing of Mainstay, said the band reminded him just a bit of the Goo Goo Dolls. When they're really rocking (how I personally like them best), they have a terrific, full sound. I have no regrets about purchasing this album and look forward to more from Mainstay!"
3,stay and listen!,"Being a local music enthusiast, I had an immediate interest in Mainstay when I first heard about them. Musically, Become Who You Are has some nice melodies and hooks and a good even balance of ""slow songs"" and harder rocking material. One of the strongest points of Mainstay is Justin Anderson's crooning vocals. Comparable to the superb vocals of J.R. Richards from Dishwalla or Kevin Max of Dc Talk, I gotta imagine that voice helped propel them from ""just another"" suburban garage band to a nationally known group on the mainstream Christian music circuit. The only reason I didn't give this 4 or 5 stars was that it seems to lack the underground alternative rock or indie rock sound I was hoping for. So that is only me. Become Who You Are leans more towards being a polished pop rock record, but whether you like that or not, Mainstay has a good solid effort here, no doubt!"
3,Call to Treason: Op-Center,I have read most of the other Op-Center books. This is good and has some of the suspense as the others. The challenge is there is no foreign activity and another country involved. I did not think it as good as the others.
5,OP-Center Series Reborn,"Call to Treason renews my faith in the OP-Center series. I've read them all and this chapter returns to its roots-- a good, couldn't guess the ending story. A very good read!"
4,HE'S BACK,"AFTER SEE OF FIRE I HAD MY DOUGHT'S, BUT I LOVED THIS BOOK I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IS THE SAME WRITER. I HOPE HE KEEP,S UP THE GOOD WORK. I DID NOT LIKE SOME OF THE PERSONNEL CHANGES AND I WANT TO SEE STRIKER BACK"
2,"Awful, awful, awful","The helicopters on the cover of this novel are actually flying through all the massive holes in this story's plot.The final resolution requires the reader to make too many ridiculous leaps. Obviously it's fiction, but the author never draws me in to the world he's attempting to craft. The characters are dry and without depth and most of the dialogue reads like it was written by a 4th grader.I begrudingly give it two stars because I did stick with it till the end because I HAD to know how it was all going to end ... so I guess that says something."
2,Boring and predictable,"The author Roven is no Clancy. If you are looking for something interesting and full of twists, don't go here. It is a slow drawn out plot of no interest, with no reality. There are several characters that could be the bad guys, but you don't really care if it is them or all of them. After just living through the real overthrow of a government, this is meek, tame and a sleeper. Had a hard time finishing. Better to go with a Clancy military novel."
2,Below average for any reader,last year's Sea of Fire was much better (despite its ending)call to treason is not a very compelling novelits dry and lacking what most clancy's have such as:-Twists-Action-Thrillif your a diehard fan there will be no stoping you though i cant recomend itbut for the rest of you pick up something else unless your really desperate
4,"Mauler THIS, buddy!","They Might Be Giants do a stellar cover of ""New York City."" I saw Cub open for TMBG a few years ago. My girlfriend at the time yelled at me because I stared at the drummer through the whole set. I think she was jealous (my ex-girlfriend, not the drummer)."
1,"Goes brittle in the sun, wastes space","Left out in the sun, goes brittle and cracks in about a year. The see through plastic gets filthy from charcoal dust first thing. Bags take up less space. Don't bother."
3,Month-by-Month,"I was very excited to purchase this book when i read it was about the Pennsylania area. Our state! My area has a short warm season. This being the reason I wanted to learn about plants that do well in my town. Well I was not as excisted once I began to read. The book left me alittle disappointed. Hoping for a better summary of what is best to plant. It is broken down in to month by month catagories ie. annuals, trees, rose etc. Basically repeating the same info over and over from section to section. I would have really injoyed some visual pictures. This would have sparked some greater depth to the book. Needless to say, this book doesn't teach me anything more than I already know."
2,Stopped working after 2 days,My lighter stopped working after 2 days. Something wrong with ignition (gas still worked when I held a lighter up to it)
5,"Subtle, not overpowering","I do not like overpowering scents on a man, and this is my husbands favorite. Good thing I love it too!!"
5,Epitome of Skateboarding,"In this new age of ""Extreme"" sports, skateboarding has lost what used to be the most visual part of itself; Just getting on your board and skating. All the technical stuff was left to the freestylers like Per Welinder and Rodney Mullen. Though it has evolved all together, many of us ""Old School"" skaters still look to this video as the core of what skating was and how fulfilling it was just to jum on your board, never master 180 nollie heelflips and such.The session through San Francisco really showed just how awesome ""the city"" is for just skating. Tommy, where are yooooo..."
1,Dude it blows (and not in the good way),Its a big fan. Doesn't cool. I had to return it. Lost money. Boo!
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,YEA IT LOOKS NICE IN THE PICTURE BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE WHEEL IT WILL RIP....AND WHO HAS THE TIME TO PACKAGE IT BACK UP AND MAIL IT BACK...I DONT!! EASIER TO BUY THIS AT A LOCAL STORE SO IT IS EASIER TO RETURN!!
2,Disappointment,"This bat hit well for the first year. After that, there was a rattling inside the barrel. Last week the bat broke in half at the handle, just like a wood bat would do. I am disappointed in the quality of the bat."
4,"Nice to have, to expensive","You must be very carefull with the fake magazine, it go off whit out notice, and you spend half day seaching were it got off the weapon..get silicon and glue it, so you cant loose it any more..Taito from Panama rep of Panama"
5,bull sh$t music,he should have not even release thaat album sounding like that he should try hard to be like his brother or sound better then p not worses love confidential
1,"by far, the worst of the limit records in the past year",this album consists of about 26 song and about 23 of them are crap. that sums it up right there
5,His debut is his best ever,"This is the best cd released in 1998. This album is the chronicle of ANY gangsta rap cd. The album opens with an instrumental intro. Then opens the song ""A 2nd Chance"" from there the album rides itself! This cd is truly incredible."
4,"c murder aka 187 june 13, 2004","i don't know what 2 say i mean this soulja is raw on this album his talkin bout real gangsta stuff when i bought this album i didn't like nolimit until i listen 2 the songs when i was listening 2 the songs i was amazed i really like where i'm from,soldier,a second chanse,duck n run,on the run,g's and macks,ghetto ties,makin moves,and the track with c and p and for yall tru nolimit fans out there you'll love bossalinie and traped in crime nolimit 4life"
5,NO LIMIT CAN'T BE STOP,C-MURDER YOU AND FIEND BE RIDEN THE WHOLE NO LIMIT DO YALL BOYS KEEP BALLIN CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE YALL STOP
5,Fu$k Yeah,"This cd is the best of c murder yet! I give five stars because 99.9% of the songs are good on it! I especially like 3,4, and 22."
3,A Great Soldier Anthem...,"But, that's about it on C-Murder's debut solo album. Much like his fellow TRU brotha Silkk, Life or Death grows long and boring after awhile. But, tracks like ""Soldiers,"" ""Akickdoe!"" and ""Cluckers"" make it worth considering if you have the cash."
1,Self-Hating Gay,"I could really get into this album if it wasn't filled with lots of gay references. ""Gonna pop a cap in that m*thf*ckaz ass"" ""gotta get down with my homeys"" ""I be makin' dat punk my b*tch"".... I realize some people are deeply conflicted about these perfectly natural desires and fantasies, but hearing it put to rap just doesn't work. Calhoon Mintroux would be a lot happier and would rap better if he (she?) wasn't too caught up in trying to prove his manhood. He ain't fooling no one."
3,"Together Again, for the very first time","Mikky and the Milkman oughta get married. Behind their mutual antagonism I sense a frustrated mutual attraction. If they could only get past their differences in musical taste (he likes classical rock, she digs gangsta rap), I feel they would make a cute, loving couple. I would be happy to officiate at the commitment ceremony (I am a Justice of the Peace). Together they can explore the beauties of C-Murder's magnum opus and perhaps indulge in a little good old-fashioned rockabilly as well. Eventually they could conceive a child together and their joy would be complete. They could grow old together and take gentle care of each other as they went gently into that good night.Seriously, I think Mikky and Milky are one and the same person. Stop with the drama, dude."
3,overrated,"you might as well get The Best of: since most of the songs in this CD are in it, including Down for my N's, and a few other ones not in this CD. Essentially you would be buying Life or Death. Another thing is this CD is too slow, I like his newer material, C-P-3.com, Bossalinie, and Trapped in Crime, those are his best CD's. Else buy The BEst of C-Murder."
3,THIS IS TIGHT!,"I BOUGHT THIS CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. I GOT IT FOR MY BROTHER. I LIKED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE FOR MY CAR. HE SOUNDS ALOT LIKE TUPAC, ESPECIALLY ON ""SHOW ME LOVE."" ALL THE BEATS ARE OUT THE GATE, BUT MY FAVORITE IS ""AKICKDOE!"" WITH BUN-B OF UNDERGROUND KINGS. YUP!"
5,Da Bomb!,"This is an excellant cd through and through. C-Murder has a 2Pac type of flow, but is the bomb in his own catagory. For any No Limit fan, this is a must-get. ""Feel My Pain"" and ""Where I'm From"" are my two personal favs off this album. I also like ""Watch Yo Enemies"" because it tells it how it is. Rap on C-Murder an' keep em bumpin."
5,U might get your head split,Belive me if you don't have this c.d. get it.To all you haters quit hattin ya'll hoes and hoes talk s**t come on Down South u might get your head split.C-Murder has done came up in tha rap game.Sellig c.d's nation wide.The one's that hate it you bought it.It's all about tha money.
5,perfect debut abum,"""life or death"" is definitely one of the best albums out of no limit.C-Murder is one of the best lyricysts in the rap business. he's got a great voice that can send chills down ya spine in a few of his songs. the best songs on this album are ""Don't play no games"",""Picture me"",""On the run"",""The TRUest shit"",and ""Soldiers""."
1,the reviewer from dallas should be palpated,"What on earth was that guy from Dallas talking about? Was he even talking about Nestor Coomaraswamy's brilliant sophomore effort, ""Life or Death""? First of all, this is Nestor's forty-seventh attempt at supplicating the gnomon. And his real name is Catherine Diebenkorn. Most of the albums in this genre that you hear nowadays are 3/4 spot zoning and 1/4 spousal disqualification. Nestor reverses these proportions, for an effect we like to call ""symmetrical sheathing"". If you wanna hear real, hard-core Geschissenmusik, then this is the pure unadulterated sh*t right here. The esteemed gentilhomme from Dallas should be rhythmically palpated for that review. Someone should softly brush his clean-shaven armpits with scented peacock feathers. Sweet boy."
2,The Little Lord Fauntleroy of Rap,"Did you guys know that ""C-Murder"" grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, and went to a private school, where he excelled at horseback riding and modern interpretive dance? Did you know he took another boy to his senior prom? Did you know that he started out performing bubble-gum music (as lead singer for a ""wholesome"" n'sync ripoff called The Copy Boys) but switched to rap when his manager told him he'd make more money pretending to be a gangster? Did you know that he's a teetotaler and has never touched a woman? Did you know that he was once caught in a bathroom stall with George Michael? (He said he was just helping his friend adjust his wardrobe and there was nothing unseemly going on. Sure, I believe that.)But if believing that this boy's a scary thug helps you get through the day, keep on believing it."
4,wow,"used to rip out ceramic tile it worked great, sds hammer drill makes the job better. needed to be wider though"
3,Great for decor only,"In all fairness, I purchased this net for a stencil & not the novelty/prop it was actually intended. To hang as decor or a set/stage prop I'm sure it works very well. For any other use it seems to not hold up at all."
5,excellent value,"I purchased this to replace one that had seen heavy duty for 3 decades. the new one is just as good as the old, perhaps better. first job was driving a steel stake into the ground - left no marks at all on the sledge."
3,Uneven double,"While the sometimes confusing story of non-Aristotelian logic (Null A) has been a favorite story since I was 12, I only recently read the Universe Maker, and found it poorly done, with an almost insulting ending.The first Ace Double sci fi issue, they were also published separately. I'd recommend Null-A to anyone with an interest in classic Sci-Fi, but Universe Maker I can only recommend to people completing their Van Vogt or Ace Double collections."
5,Great Book,"Book is awesome, has complete and detailed information. Was very useful in my class work. Great Book!"
4,My daughter loves this...,"My daughter loves this movie so much that this is the second one I have gotten her. While it isn't mind blowing or ground breaking, it is entertaining for her."
5,GREAT VIDEO,My 2 year old loves this video. We watch a lot of Sesame Street and this video is her favorite.
5,movie,Wonderful movie! My 2 year old daughter loved it! Neat spin on an old story - would recommend to anyone with preschool aged children.
5,Wonderful Video!,Sesame Street: Abby in WonderlandThis is the first video that I have ever seen that can keep a group of 5 year olds MESMERIZED for the entire program! This production is very educational as well as entertaining! Highly recommended!
2,Boring DVD,"Based on the reviews, I rushed out and purchased this DVD for my daughter. The DVD is boring and tedious. It seems to be more of a showcase of the varous transformations that Sesame Street characters undergo in Wonderland, than a fun story and music. Abby is a cute character, but Elmo is much more interesting in the theme DVDs."
4,"Very informative, great book for browsing","Having grown up with a strictly creationist religion which I left behind years ago, I found this book very informative. I was mostly interested in the theological, biblical, and ethical sections. Some of the arguments were familiar, and since I could still remember reading them with the pro-creationist religious slant, it was fascinating to view these from the opposite perspective. Some of the more scientific topics admittedly went somewhat over my head, such as the various dating methods. I like the way the book is structured by subjects, which made it really easy to find the sections of greatest interest to me.Unfortunately, I found that occasionally the book stoops to a polemic tone. There were several mentions of 'religious bigotry', creationism was called 'rife with intellectual dishonesty', and I picked up on another handful of blanket accusations against creationists. I thought this tone was doing the book a disservice."
3,A Useful reference book.,"If you are battling a creationist it this book can be a useful tool. I found that some of the responses were lacking in the detail required to silence some of the opponents one might encounter, yet these might provide at least a basis for more research to fill in the details."
4,WAYYYYY pleased and better than expected,"This teapot just blew me away when I used it. So many little features make it great -- just big enough, even for two... top locks on, not drippy, great handle, finial is functional as well as stylish...The only reason I rated it low is that it wasn't clear that it was more of a matte finish, and I really wanted a glossy white one to go with other tea stuff I own.Love this little pot, though!"
3,"Great for frequent use, but...","This product is great if you just need a cheap serviceable teapot, however, instead of being white when we got it, it was this weird, off color white, almost as if it had been burned. Like i said though if you just need a cheap usable teapot, its great."
3,Could have been higher,"This saw is a starter saw and I am a beginner. However the skills needed to align the blade (No it was not aligned when it arrived. It was over a 1/4 inch off and the blade was touching the table.) requires a skilled mechanic. I attempted to contact Delta through thier website and although promised assistance in one business day it never happened. I recontacted Delta and was again promised assistance. That never happed either.The post from another buyer, thank goodness one who is experienced with table saws was how I fixed my saw. I had to completely disassemble the saw, adjust it and reassemble."
2,Stetzer,Wish I had paid more attention to the prevous review! Thought O.K. it can be adjusted. That's good. ... But not when it is so badly out of alignment that adjustment parameters(which are very hard to access) can't do it. It took several hours and some custom work to get this unit into alignment. DON'T buy unless you like frustration.
2,What do you expect.,Nice hobby saw for ocasional use. I've used mine almost every day for close to 2 years. That was to much for it. Bearings seized up so a throw away item now. While it was running it did an ok job. I especially liked the lightweight. Will go with another brand and pay a higher price.
4,Worked well for me,"The saw worked great for the project I bought it for which was cutting 1"" knotty pine paneling and making smaller trim pieces out of larger ones. I also made some nice shelves out of lumber left over from a previous construction project. I rate it good for the occasional home improvement project. It was easy to set up and worked fine out of the box. If you plan on doing fine cuttung, you'll need to replace the balde that comes with it."
2,Not very robust,"Out of the box, the ripfence fell apart. Amazon was GREAT about replacing it, even though several months had gone by since we purchased it. Delta couldn't help - the part was on backorder for 2-3 months, maybe indefinitely. When I pointed out that so many people would not have requested replacements if this part had been designed properly, the customer service rep admitted that this table saw is not one of their better products and it will be discontinued shortly. He stated that the product's performance was hurting Delta's reputation, and it's not meant for commercial use. We used the Shopmaster to cut redwood boards for a small terrace and it worked fine. But it's just a matter of time before something else breaks, and then Delta won't have any replacement parts in stock."
4,Great little jobsite saw,"I've used this saw for a couple of years now on the jobsite for both framing and limited trim work. It has seen moderate use by several workers. It needed no adjustment out of the box and has performed fine for what it is....and inverted 10"" circular saw fixed to a table. It is light and easy to move around. It sometimes trips off on overload when I rip much framing material. The miter gage is plastic and I've had to rebuild it once rather than spend $40 bucks for a new one. The switch has failed and it was easy enough to get a replacement on-line. Everything else is still functioning properly. For the money, its a good value and adequate for light to moderate use."
4,Delta SM200L,This is the second one I've bought. It works really well. I have expensive tools and get just as much work out of this one. It's definitely worth it!
4,Black & Decker/Delta 10: Table saw,"I ordered the Delta and was sent a Black and Decker which is about the same, which is good. Great buy for the dollar. It is not exactly the sturdiest piece of equipment, but handled properly it works fine for almost anything except for large boards or long pieces. It is not really ideal for critically fine work as the fence and sliding guage are not sturdy enough for a pin-point tight lock down. But I like it fine and will use it regularly."
5,Terrific!,"Hi, everybody! Wow, this book was one of those inspiring ones. History, traditions, love, courage, will -- all seen through the prizm of communication of children with parents. FAITH is different for everyone. Erich Seagal let readers see how different people imagine faith. Even those who do not believe in any POWER(s), unconsciously act by faith and with faith. Very delightful book."
4,Segal's most absorbing novel,"I disliked the campiness of Love Story, was a bit bored by The Class, and was depressed by Oliver's Story. Only Love made me want to give this novel a chance, and I'm glad I did. This is a book I read over and over. Rarely, if ever, does one find both love and characters so pure at heart and by action. Finally, here is a romance where I understand what the protagonists love about each other. Daniel could have been left out of the story, though - I'm not sure why a character so incidental to the overall plot was given sections from his point of view."
3,ENVIRONMENT DIFFERS.......,"Except that of author's mastery over the language and his interestto explore the facts & places connected with the novel, nothing specialabout to say. Events are turned up, as expected. Sometimes, just to fillpages, author is bound to bring out- deviating from story track of course-,some unwanted stuff. Say, Daniel fell in love with mariam ( How come!No good looking girls at places where he's gone), Timothy's meetingof hardt, etc.,. Author would have made the novel very simple conforming tothe truth of St. Paul. I.e. "" IT IS BETTER TO MARRY THAN TO BURNWITH THE DESIRE OF LUST"". One more thing. Being an Indian,the one more fact which is indigestible to me, is that of the seminariangoing to pros and Father having intercourse with woman. Of course,Timothy has come out from his priesthood. Still... you feel like asking""What's the use timothy, reading all the theologies in the world and gettingoff from it ?"". Anyway, read it and see yourselves."
4,An interesting twist on love and religion,I would recommend this book if you would like to learn more about Judiasm and Christianity while reading a great book! A bit dull at times though. But it says a lot about love and passion.
2,"And I thought ""Jepthe's Daughter"" was preposterous!","I'm going to go out on a limb here and be a heretic by disagreeing with the other reviewers of this book. I thought it was an utter piece of trash. The book was entirely predictable. I knew from the third chapter that the Catholic Timothy would become a priest and he'd fall in love with the Jewish Deborah who would be tossed out of the family home by her one-dimensional father. In fact, I found all of the characters to be disagreeable, the plot tedious and the manipulation of religion to suit the storyline distasteful.I suppose if you are looking for a good laugh, this book might be interesting. I, however, didn't even find it funny. I found myself exclaiming out loud ""Oh come on! That's ridiculous!"" at multiple times as the book progressed. If you value your time, don't waste it on this book."
4,Unfairly reviewed??,"Eric Segal's ACTS OF FAITH is noted to receive some very harsh and negative reviews here. I disagree with them. Although I have not finished this novel I give it high marks. Segal teaches, Segal focuses on real life dilemmas, Segal intertwines ( in Doctors also ) historical time pieces and events. His truly enormous intellect shows in his ouvre. This novel brings one to tears, evokes great emotions, and engenders a desire to learn more and more. More books like this one would be a blessing.Thank you Segal for the BIG TALENT you are.GMG..................los angeles."
1,Largely Irrelevant Fluff,"Nothing practical. Just a bunch of rah-rah in favor of the Clearcase product, the entire Rational Suite, and RUP in general. Pretty much a waste if you need to plan and execute a clearcase deployment. Probably useful to IBM/Rational account reps looking for some talking points about the products they're selling."
2,Still looking for THE book...,"Agree wholeheartedly with Javaman777. I thought this would beTHE book that would explain to me in Dick-and-Jane fashion how to use ClearCase. It's like the authors are standing on the deck looking through their binocs and every once in a while exclaiming ""thar she blows!"" when ClearCase is close. other than that, lots of practical advice on seafaring, ship design, the sea state, how to read cloud formations, how to deal with the ship's owners, etc. OK, say I have a very practical, nuts-and-bolts CM task staring me right in the face - how do I use ClearCase to get it done?? Skip all the hoopla, what is the first thing I see on the screen when ClearCase comes up??"
1,This is a book on ClearCase? - could have fooled me...,It's unbelievable how much this author can write without telling you about the specifics of using ClearCase. It's actually hard to find relevant information. Out of 432 pages I would estimate maybe 100 give you hard core information on how to use Clear Case. If you want a technical manual this book is not for you.
5,"Camelan Bamboo Windchimes, - Small","I ordered a set of camelan bamboo windchimes in November, 2006 as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I couldn't have been happier, not only with the windchimes themselves, but also with the careful packaging and speedy delivery time. I would definitely purchase this item again."
3,its one of the better organizers,"the idea is there but it lacks. first its a twenty dollar piece of plastic. overpriced for what it is. has a slot for the Wii and then a bigger open slot to put the remotes in and slots for games on the top. it is nice in a way because it allows you to have something like a dvd player or other component on top of the system, but you can't store games if you do. the Wii sits and ""floats"" as it has spacing around it. i thought this was a nice feature for cooling until i realized the thing blocks the side fan altogether so the extra cooling space really doesn't make up for it. I am thinking of returning it because its not worth burning my system out. I am also considering cutting my own hole for the fan and keeping it because it is one of the better Wii organizers but could have have a little more thought put into it."
5,Great book,"David Seamands really gets down to the heart of things and isn't afraid to conquer the hard stuff. I had already read the book some time ago but I really wanted to do the workbook too. I loved having questions to ponder over what I'd read and get me to thinking about my own spiritual life more. I would highly recommend this book. And if you haven't seen it someplace else, the workbook contains the entire book also so you don't have to buy both!"
5,Life Changer,"I have discovered this book by a friend and had to have my own copy! It is what I have been searching for. other books scratch the surface and then leave you hanging to move onto a different topic, this book is true healing if you want to be healed.BUT you only need the workbook!!! it has the book built into it :)"
5,Wonderful Study!,"I went through this study a couple of years ago at my church and it really helped me deal with issues in my life. Now I'm excited about the prospect of teaching it to a new group of women at my church. It helped me get honest with myself, others, and especially God, and to stop thinking I had to be perfect. It's great - I recommend it to everyone!"
3,Have always been a big fan of Mr.Brown,"The song 'Dorothy's Love Letter' is VERY, VERY NICE!!!!! It's like the band just let loose when they got to that cut. WOW!!!"
1,No David Crowder,"I ordered this CD because I thought it had a certain David Crowder version of You Alone on it. It did not have that song at all, so I was not satisfied with my purchase."
4,Be Still,"Very applicable, struck the heart, increased intimacy and friendship w/God, eye-opening to the richness of His wisdom."
3,View From Me,"This was the third or fourth book I read on Wicca.I must say it is a good reference book. Good for beginners. Wonderful author.On the negative note- it was just a bit boring for me, facts upon facts, but just a bit. Also she leans toward her egyptian path in the writing and spells. When she names Gods and Goddesses it seems to only be the Egyptians.But I would still recommend this book. I do like the details, not a ""general info"" book."
1,Highly derivative- get a better book,"I would not recommend any book in which the author states that a certain spell is highly unethical, and then goes on to give detailed instructions for the spell, as Holland does more than once in this text.While many people praise ""The Wicca Handbook""'s extensive tables of correspondence, she does not present anything here that can't be found in other, better books. I do not get the impression that she has actually used all of these correspondences, or even all of the spells she presents, but rather has found them through reading other books herself. I suggest that it is better to read a book which contains fewer correspondences, but which is written by an author who actually has experience working with them her- or himself.Skip this one and read something by the Farrars, Buckland, Cunningham, Starhawk, or Hopman."
3,Food for thought.,"I think this book was a good read, she clearly states the differences between ""good"", and ""bad"" magic. She gave examples of ""bad magic"" in her book, not as a guideline; but as a reference I believe of the types of spells to avoid. She seems to be very level headed, and have a firm grasp of reality, unlike some witch flakes you run into."
5,Great book,"This book had alot of information that was very helpful to me since I am just learning. This is a very useful guide, great information. I would highly recommend this book."
1,Oh dear,"I notice that the majority of 5 stars are from new witches. I also note that the most gushing is from Ororo - Eileen's close friend!! As a witch of 28 years, I can assure you this book is full of re-hashed information that has been written a hundred times before. It is obsessed with magick and spells. It has nothing to do with Wicca as a belief system. Oh, it touches on them briefly, then promptly takes you into more hocus-pocus. It is extremely irresponsible, with paragraphs on why love spells are wrong, then devotes several pages to them. It's no good saying that is up to the reader's integrity - she also condemns ""cancer"" spells, and doesn't feel the need to explain how it is done. I also found it quite disturbing that she seemed slightly smug and proud that she did a binding spell on a stalker and his baby was later born with a whole in his heart. A complete waste of money, as I think the more experienced witches have agreed."
2,Hypocrite?,"Well, I'd have to say the correspondeces will likely serve their purpose from this book, but quite frankly, most of the information contained in the book is a rehashing of what's already out there. See does seem overly obsessed with spells, I say, and bluntly writing -harmful- spells and publishing them in this book was overly irresponsible, especially when it seems to be attracting newer practitioners. :(If you read this book, by all means, please read others as well. There are much better ones to follow for beginners than Ms. Holland's."
2,Not impressed.,"Honestly, I'm not impressed. I'm pretty picky buying books about witchcraft, and after reading the reviews decided to give this one a shot. I haven't even gotten to the middle and I already feel sorry I bought it. It's nothing more than the very, VERY basic information, and it's not even well written! I've read good things about the author but I am disappointed. I wish I didn't buy it."
5,Excellent reference for new wiccans,"This book is awesome, Holland explains things sooo clearly. The book is set up in a way that it can be used for reference or read all the way through. I highly recommend this book to every one, new wiccans and those who have practiced the craft for years."
3,"Great Sound, Questionable Video","I upgraded from a Lifestyle 35 to a 48. On the 35 there was a problem with lock ups while playind DVD's. I have only had this 48 for a week and I have played three store bought DVD's without any lock ups but while playing DVD's made on my computer or a DVD burner they seem to freeze and I get a message ""cannot read disc"". I called Bose tech support since this happened so frequently and they are overnight shipping me a new media center. I have my doubts if this will solve the problem as Bose seems to have a problem with DVD's. They produce great speakers and audio products but there venture into DVD playing systems seems to me to be full of problems,"
3,Pleasant yet Bland,"The book reads nicely, yet I miss seeing something exciting come into Miss Holley's life. Surely there is someone or something to pique her interest other than family responsibilities. Signed, Cynthia"
4,Portable system that packs a punch!,"This portable system is a little heavier than I initially anticipated, but not so bad I can't get it everywhere I need to go. I am a fitness instructor that teaches at several different locations with no sound equipment at all. This system is perfect for the size classes I currently teach and when I open my studio it will be more than enough to be set up in a more permanent fashion. The special Voice override feature is nice for presentations where you need the music to turn down while you are speaking, but I can't use this feature in a fitness class. I can plug in my microphone, iPod, and a CD player and still have room for more if I wanted. Very happy with this purchase and a great deal!"
2,Cool coffee maker - which is BAD for a coffee maker!,"Makes cool coffee. In the carafe, it gets even cooler. The carafe spout dribbles unless you rest it on the edge of the mug. After 3 months of this, I am surfing the web for a new coffee maker. (Also because I keep forgetting to empty the carafe, and it makes a huge overflowing mess, but that is my fault).Bottom line - don't get this if you want HOT coffee."
4,"Great, but pricey.","The phone slips inside the cover quite easily and fits well. The power button is SLIGHTLY less responsive; had the phone came packaged with this cover, one would have no prior knowledge of ease its of use. That is, without the cover, the button pushes very easily. With, you must use a bit more muscle, but it is not a problem in the least. I experienced no issues with the volume buttons or the headphone jack.Product is thin and protects the phone just fine. Clings to surfaces, but can still be removed from the pocket without struggle.Only gave four stars because of the price. I can't imagine it cost China more than a buck or two to produce, but such is the way of the world.Package with '3-Pack HTC Desire G7 Combo LCD Screen Protector for HTC Desire G7' and you are good to go."
5,Easy to find on the jobsite!,This is a tool that does exactly what it was designed to do. I really appreciate the bright orange color because it is very easy to spot in a hurry when you're working.
5,Bang on!,"The goods were received exactly as expected, and fast. I'm impressed with the service and nicely done corrugated box packaging."
5,one of the best safety items you can get,"Great product and i now have peace of mind when the kids take a bath!! My son who is 4 1/2 recently was playing in the tub and hit his forehead with the faucet. thankfully no stitches were needed but he had a nice cut which bled alot. I immediately started searching the net for a product that covers the faucets and this is the only one i found. Its a great price and it serves it purpose. I also have a 1yr old son too and now i've learned my lesson with tubs, this item is a BIG MUST HAVE!!!!"
3,Quick read but not what I remembered,"I read this novel years ago, in the 1980s. At the time, I thought it was imaginative, thrilling, and sophisticated. After stumbling across it again just recently and re-reading it, I found it to be interesting, but not at all like I remembered. The first time I read it, I took it at face value, but now can see this is obviously a send-up of spy novels. It is somewhat dated, but many of the themes in the book are still current - information technology, the power of oil, and terrorism are just as important as ever. As a spoof it misses the mark, and often comes across as overbearing, preachy, and pompous. The cultural biases and continual lambasting of Western culture wear thin after a while. Overall, a good read, but not what I expected. I liked it much better the first time I read it."
4,Very good,"Not perfect but very good. I like the way Trevanian turns the genre against itself and the tricks he plays with viewpoint.I think the key to understanding Nicholai comes in a sentence early in the book when he first learns about shibumi: ""In pursuit of shibumi he could excel invisibly, without attracting the attention and vengeance of the tyrannical masses."" Does anyone know of a book in english that discusses concepts like sabi, wabi,karumi,shiori and shibumi in depth?"
3,Kind of like a terrific B movie,"I loved this book when I was in my very early twenties, it was ""must"" reading among young men that were into martial arts in the early 80s. However, perspective changes with age and the only well developed character in the story is the main character, the other characters really have no development at all and are very cartoonish. It is easy to get into if you are on vacation and want to relax on a beach."
3,Pretty good,if you like reading about a psycho who had a pretty tough life and now kills people for a living. Not gripping but interesting.
1,The perfect lover...,"This book stands out as the worst book I have ever read in this genre. The plot is outlandish, but that could be forgiveable if it weren't for the ridiculous hero he created. The hero is the most special and accomplished expert on every aspect of existence that the world has ever seen. Everything he does is better than anything the reader can comprehend. He might as well have written an exclamation point after every sentence. The part that really made me laugh out loud is that he is such an incredible lover that some young girl he screws, upset at their inevitable parting, kills herself because she knows she will never find another man who can satisfy her. Has the author ever even met a woman? His interactions with women read like what a 13-year-old would write during slow moments in math class.The term ""shibumi"" has been a joke in our household for years."
1,Careful reading,"I read this book when it first came out and recently read a magazine article praising it. After re-reading it I am puzzled by other reviews. It is a slow moving spy thriller with little action. Worse, this novel has a strong anti-western slant. It's filled with stereotypes and is very condescending to any person who knows basic history. All the characters aside from the main protagonist are caricatures. Want to read a thriller? Check out the non-fiction ""Unbroken""."
1,Kindle edition is not worth it!,"When the paperback is available for $10.20 and the Kindle edition is $11.99, I have utterly NO interest in rewarding that sort of behavior of the publisher ... particularly when it's an old book."
5,You need to have half a brain for this one,"It's quite unfortunate that O'Reilly apparently endorsed this book. You see, reading most novels is slightly more difficult than reading the stock market quotes in the Wall Street Journal or reading People Magazine or the Drudge Report. Anyway, the book is excellent."
2,"Great start, boring middle, and terrible ending","I think that this book needed to be trimmed down inside the middle of the book by about 100 pages or so. Nothing but a boring caving expedition with Le Cagot. The ending was rushed and uneventful, while I think the character growing up was quite interesting, later on in the book it just felt really rushed to me - and quite unbelievable. Got a little tired of the American society bashing (how chic, hmm), and how Nicholai was above it all and greater than all nationalities on earth. Just a dissapointing book for me, and the ending was so rushed and anti-climatic I felt it was a waste of time."
5,An Excellent Intellegent Novel,"One of the best thrillers , Or Maybe Even the best one IHave ever read ..... beutifully written , very intellegen ,teaches the reader about different cultures , beutifull , simplybeutifull....i recommend it with all my heart"
4,Masterful intertwining of intrique and unfathomable detail,"I'm not sure how this novel escaped me when first published, but it has pushed to the front of my summer reading. Challenging but worth it."
5,Hard to make me talk but.......,"I'm not the kind of person who goes on-line and writes reviews. Let my opinion stay just that, and let yours be yours. Having said all of that, this book has motivated me to write. Shibumi is a fantastic read. There are parts of the book that drag, like Moby Dicks whaling chapters, but they are short and inconsequential in relation to the meat of the book. If you enjoy thrillers, action-pact adventure with a spy/romance/zen twist you should read this at once. If this isn't enough, my girlfriend loved this book and she HATES all of the things I just mentioned. Read it."
3,Loved the first half,"I'll keep this vague as to not give away plot points. I thought the book started out great. I really enjoyed the first half and found it very exciting.Then, for the second half, it didn't really go anywhere and I found it very boring. All of the excitement and momentum was in the first half. I wish I would have stopped at the mid point."
2,A very disappointing book!,"Shibumi came with so much hype and rave reviews behind it that I could hardly wait to open the pages of this the ""Great Trevanian's"" spy novel.I started reading and reading, waiting to be pulled in to the best spy novel since the world was created.Sadly, it just never happened.Some of Shibumi was good, other parts were not. Some parts were just completely unbelievable. Many parts that did not seem that important to the story seemed to go on forever.Like I said, a very disappointing book and one I was glad to be done with and throw in the garbage.In a side note, I would appreciate it if some of you who read this review would give me a ""helpful"" vote. I am trying to become a top notch reviewer."
5,A book that changes peoples lives,"I first read Shibumi back in 1981. I was changed forever. Since then, I have lent, bought it as gifts, and encouraged those who I thought would appreciate the importance of the book. People laugh when I say it is the best novel of the 20th Century. It was given to my non-book reading father in 1986; since then he has become a serious reader of fiction and historical novels. The characters are gripping, real and are perfectly placed within the story line(s). An education in history, geography, geology, politics, and Eastern philosophies are waiting for those who are willing to take the journey. I still have the original hardback, but re-read a paperback version at least once a year."
4,Interesting character development,"Well put together plot with an interesting central character The use of the game, Go as an organizing principle adds to the appeal of the book."
4,Excellent,This was an excellent read 20 yrs ago and still is. All his work was enjoyable. Always wished he had written more and some of these new authors who write a book every year didn't.
2,"IN MY OPINION, THIS IS A DISAPPOINTING BOOK","I heard about this book, I believe it was from the book called ""The O'Reilly Factor"" by Bill O'Reilly. He thought the book was good. After reading Shibumi, I have to say I will now question O'Reilly's judgement a bit more than I have in the past. Maybe I went into this book with expectations set too high, I don't know, but I can say, after reading it, that I did not care for this book. The book was not very realistic and rambled in certain areas. For example, in one area it goes on and on about exploring a cave, which did not have that much to do with the story. The ending left a lot of questions and was unbelievable, in my opinion. I don't want to get into everything, so I will just say that book was not that good. It was not terrible, but just not very good. Quite overrated from the way I see it."
2,"Great Start, Then Crashes and Burns","I couldn't put the book down, as they say, for its first half. Although I knew I was reading a Japanese view of WWII, it was nonetheless fascinating if terribly incomplete and as one sided as an American WWII propanganda film. Then when the book moves locales to the Basque region and modern times, it tumbles and falls deeply into coyness and predictability. All of a sudden, it's as if some ronin author barged in, drugged the first author and started writing some one dimensional cartoon novel. The characters become cardboard and cute and the protaganist's sermonizing puts him right up there with the Sunday T.V. preachers genre, albeit the protaganist is pushing a different theology.A good writer realizes there is no black and white in any character: within the circle there is the yin and the yang and even within each yin there is a little yang and vice versa. This makes for authenticity, for we see ourselves in the mixture."
1,Shibumi,Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I did like his Incident at Twenty Mile and it prompted me to read another of his books. The whole thing was a hugh dissapointment.
1,Silly Mysticism,Just trying to create a super hero in his image you know every step before... just a plan to create something book is about shibumi but far away from shibumi just a relaxation for him and waste of time for me
2,Asinine,"At least James Bond isn't an elitist vegitarian. Plotting obvious, ""Anti-hero"" subtext snooze-o-rama. Spelunking bits read like (...) boring/extraneous unless you're writing a dissertation. Is that what you want from a thriller? I didn't think so. We give this the finger."
5,magnific!!,Shibumi is the most intelligently written book that I've read. It is much more than a classic for me!
2,Too bad about the Kindle price,"I read this book in paperback years ago. I was thinking about re-reading it, as I truly enjoyed it. But that ain't going to happen. It is absurd and exploitive to price a 33 year old book as if it were a best-seller. Who are we kidding? It sure didn't cost me eleven bucks when I bought it in paperback in the eighties. With all the production cost of printing and shipping a tangible book eliminated, it whould not be that much now. Sorry - but eleven bucks is too much for 33 year old electrons."
5,Top of the Line,"The best book I've read recently. Nicholas is so carefully woven and empathetic, he 'lives'. Better than usual political thriller."
3,Interesting and sometimes confusing...,Trevanian did a good job developing the back story for the very mysterious super spy/assassin Nicholai Hel. I never really felt like much happened in the actual book though. Opening up and talking about the airport shootout was gritty and I really loved the way that was done. It may be that I read this book after technology had advanced to such a degree that the computer system they used seemed...simplistic? I liked the book but wasn't in love with it. I think it is better than some of the stuff I've read from similar plots. It isn't Tom Clancy but it is effective if you like books involving World War II. I really got into the devastation and how his multi-cultural background was displayed.
5,Trevanian is a man of Shibumi...,"I've read Shibumi perhaps 10 times, and never been bored. I think the reason for this is that it's a book that's worth 10 books.Seriously, I believe that any other writer could (or rather would) manage to write 10 books with the ideas and characters of Shibumi.."
2,Childish fantasy of a frustrated man,"Ok, so I'm being a little harsh. But the main character is so cliche -- the ultimate assasin, the ultimate lover -- he's clever and heartless (but give me a break, how can he be the ultimate lover, then?) ...isn't this the fantasy of every 16-year-old? There are some interesting concepts about eastern religion in places, and definitely some good page-turning sections (the caving part was particularly good). The writing style and quality is very uneven. (I wonder if a lot of this was ghost-written...) Anyway, it's enjoyable and exciting at first, but it became annoyingly implausible and childish by the end. Shogun this is not!"
4,very good book,"I thought Julie of the wolves was a good book because it had alot of details and interesting facts and a very interesting storyline. I thought the flash backs were not that interesting but the rest of the book was.By, Andrew McDonald"
1,"bad, bad, bad, bad(julie of the wolves)",julie of the wolves stinks! I montht might be a great book if you didn't read it in school over the course months. but I'm doing a reveiw so here it goes. the book is about an eskimo girl who flees from here marriage and gets lost in the tundra. she then befriends the wolves and goes to here father that she formerly thought was dead. then she relizes that he has forsaken the old ways and flees to the tundra but after a short time she goes back and faces here new reality. the main conflict for here was trying to decide if she is going to face the new ways or stay in the old ways. again it may be a good book if you didn't read it as a school project.
1,boring story,Julie of the wolves was not a very good book at all I loathed it.The reason is beacuse I hate survival stories they are very boring and they only think about survival because they are bums and can't afford to live in the city like normal people do. And the dumbest thing I thought about the book was she talks to wolves like they are humans and they do not understand one word that you are saying and they wolves get annoning because they always howl and you can not sleep.
5,Best Yoga DVD Ever,"I love this DVD. Tamal Dodge is a remarkable yoga teacher. The instructions are clear and the class is easy to follow. I have been in Tamal's classes, which are great, and the DVD is almost as good as being in his class. The photography is beautiful. If you cannot go to Tamal's classes, this DVD is the next best thing. I highly recommend it."
1,Not Really for Beginners,"I tried this video (both programs on the video) with 2 of my friends that are VERY fit, and we had to stop each after a few minutes. This is DEFINITELY NOT a beginner's yoga DVD. I was uncomfortable for 3 days after trying it! Since purchasing this, I have dioscovered Peggy Cappy's videos that are much more reasonable, focus more on breathing, and you don't need to be a super-athlete to do them.Don't buy this unless you are in really GREAT shape."
4,Good product,This is a great Yoga instruction video for beginners such as myself. Very easy to follow along and the instructor does a good job explaining certain positions and the benefits they each serve. Highly recommended.
4,"Easy to follow, appropriately challenging","I've taken a few yoga classes and was looking for a home workout that would also work for a neighbor who has not yet taken a yoga class. We did this 60 minute practice today, and found it to be both instructional and appropriately challenging. The first 30 minutes focused more on stretching, while the next 30 minutes of flow gave us a decent workout for the first run through. (We were looking for a complement to our bi-weekly aerobic classes.) I liked it right away and believe it will be a DVD that I can use regularly."
5,Closest thing to a class,"I have ordered a number of videos over the years and this is by far the best Yoga video I have every used. The Hatha section is really perfect for beginners and in true Flow Yoga form, the Flow section is challenging but relaxing. I would say that Flow Yoga in general is a more challenging practice out of the types of yoga I have done so the word ""Beginners"" is a bit misleading if you truly are new to Yoga practice. This is a great video however and mimics the kind of relaxing practice you would find in a studio. The instructions of VERY detailed. As I have become more familiar with the video, I have found that the pace is perfect."
2,Definitely not for yoga newbies,"I notice now that most of the great reviews on this video are from people who are already into yoga. I am very flexible and rather strong, but the pace and expectations here are not at a true beginner level...maybe an experienced beginner. After 15 minutes of the flow, I just gave up. The poses weren't hard, but there wasn't even time to get yourself into position and check if you were doing it right before he was on to the next.Also, so much leaning on the hands so early on, my palms are still red and sore. He says to go at your own pace, but if you slow down to check your posture, you have just missed the next pose.It's a shame...I really wanted to like this video, and the instructor is calm and pleasant. I want to be his friend. But he's focused on his own workout, not helping me figure out mine. I bet he's the best instructor in person, but this video is not an introduction to yoga."
3,Nice routines but not for absolute beginner,"I have had minimal yoga training--only a few live classes--however, I have had a lot of dance training. I think that, without that training, I would have had a difficult time following these routines.There is almost no guidance for the beginner in how to do the poses properly. This seems to be common with these yoga DVD's that claim to be for beginners. I think this can be dangerous, because a person could injure him/herself if they don't have adequate instruction.However, if you do have some background, then I think you will enjoy these routines. Also, the instructor is very pleasant and the background is beautiful."
3,No subtitles or Other Options,"The instructor is easy enough to understand (i.e. he speaks clearly), but for people with hearing loss, that's not enough. I should have made sure this had captions. Also, there's no option to play it back without the instructions for after you've watched it several times and just want to follow along. I haven't gotten through the whole DVD yet, so can't comment on it as yoga instruction, but if subtitles and the ability to turn off instructions are important to you, you'll be disappointed. On the up side, the scenery is beautiful!"
5,excellent,Great instruction that has a very nice flow.Perfect for beginners seeking a good foundationin yoga.I would reccommend this to anyone new toyoga.
4,Good For Beginners,If you have already been introduced to Hatha Flow and wanted to learn more then this is not for you.
2,uninspired,"just boring, not inspiring didn't make me want to watch again after thefirst time. Would not buy anymore by him.It so so difficult to sort thru all of the Yoga DVD's out there to findwhats good."
3,Incomplete info,"Why isn't there any description or comments on the strap ... Pro or con as to worth the cost included in the DVD ... Or could a person use a cloth belt they already have....buy less costly elsewhere...is the belt stretchable or not? I just find it odd that there is no ""product description""of the strap."
2,Long Lasting?,"Product worked well for a few weeks, but began to fall apart at seams, allowing pieces of rubber to show, making brace ineffective."
1,Dont Buy It,Wow!! I have been using Fahrenheit since I was in 10th grade. Im 27 years young now and I have to say that this is definitely not real Fahrenheit. Dont waste your money!!!
2,Good as a refresher,"This book is good as a ""refesher"", but those starting a probability course will find it hard to grasp the concepts and ideas from probability and statistics. The beginner would be better off with the insightful book Understanding Probability from Cambridge University Press. This book contains also a great introduction to Bayesian statistics."
1,I don't want to give it any stars,"As someone has stated earlier, this book doesn't go into details of how theorems or formulas are derived. They just state it - a sign of a bad book, in my opinion. Another example of this book's awfulness is the answers to the supplemental problems; some are WRONG(see 1.53, 1.66b, 2.43 just to name a few), this has driven me and my fellow clasmates crazy; making us believe that we're not doing it right. If you're a professor, please don't make this the required textbook, or even an optional book because it sucks."
4,huh?,"Most books have errors and typos. This book is no exception but I am curious as to why some reviewers think that nothing is proven. Of course some theorems are not proven rigorously which they can't be at this level but most proofs exist. If you are confused about Jacobians, then maybe you should also reference a calculus book because Spiegel expects that you know what that is.This is an excellent book to refresh your knowledge of intro probability and statistics but assumes you are proficient in calculus."
1,How can they teach you if they don't even know the right answers?,"I have been using this book to review for the Actuarial exam, and though it has been a few years since I learned a lot of this, even I can see the blatant typos and errors. Basic editing is part of a decent book, and someone did a terrible job on this one. Aside from the typos in the text itself, far too many of the Solved Problems give a wrong answer! It has been maddening to sit and do and re-do these problems to check my work, and I feel that if the easier/beginning sections have this many problems, I will be screwed when I get to the more advanced sections and can't so easily spot the mistakes. I think it is ridiculous that someone put this book out there, trying to help people learn, and couldn't even double check that it provides correct information."
1,Looks great but is not build right,I bought this for a home network patch panel to use keystoe style sockets.It looks great in the picture but what it does not show is this panel is just a Flat peice of metal with holes cut in it. For a keystone socket to fit correctly it needs a second peice of metal behind it so the socket fits flush with the panel. This bracket does not have anyhting to hold the jacks/sockets in place.Very dissapointed.
4,Love parts of it,"I really liked this book for one reason - the pictures of the clouds were amazing. We used it specifically for cloud identification and explanation of how they are formed.The rest of the book may or may not be good, I don't really know. I browsed through it and didn't feel the need to use it except for the part mentioned above.I'd recommend checking it out from the library before you invest though."
3,Earth Angel,This song was a favorite of my husband's and mine in the 1950's. He has now passed away and I wanted to have it in my collection. I heard it on a jukebox in the Silver Diner the other day and it sounded much better than what I just heard.
4,Old School rules!,"I couldn't agree more with you Raul.The first three episodes were chalk full of segments that I remember fondly(I managed to view the entire three discs all in one evening).But it's still disappointing how they only have one episode from each season.Plus I was also getting annoyed with the repetitive showing of the Baker's # 2 segment,as well as the Jazzy Spies # 2 segment.It was quite a treat to see the unaired pilot episode.I never even knew such an episode existed.Ernie and Bert's home looked rather strange.Not only was""Old School""the era before Elmo and Zoe,but before Telli,Grungetta and Gina as well.Olivia is seen in the two later episodes of disc three.I was also glad to see Buffy Saint Marie in this set.I'm a big fan of hers."
4,all the fun i remember,"this has been a blast from the past and a great trip down memory lane that i have been enjoying with my son. already he is having fun with the letter ""M"" and the number 2. i am looking forward to more!"
4,Well done but could have been a bit better,"After watching the new PC Sesame Street of the 21st Century, it was nice to see the older episodes from the late 60's early 70's when IMO, Sesame Street was at it's best. So what if Cookie Monster eats cookies not healthy food? It was funny and entertaining.On the Con side, I think they could have kind of done a 'best of' series instead of just whole episodes. Maybe that is in the works.All in all, a must have..."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Very Disappointed in this item, expected to get more episodes then what I received. You get one episode for each year, thats it. And those episodes are very short. A complete rip off for the money. Would I buy again, No way. The extra's on the disc are just cuts from the episodes. Save your money when it comes to this product."
4,Great but when is Volume 3 coming out?,I loved the nostalgia and stuff. Does anyone know about the sketch where a father and daughter or brother were doing rolling excersises on the floor and a vaccum cleaner was in the background or something similar? And when is volume 3 debued to come out?
2,don't waste your money,"read the low reviews before you buy it, they do not lie! I was disappointed that it was not more episodes. I was expecting a lot more for my money. save $$$ and watch on youtube!"
5,Beautiful Fairy Tale,"Read the real fairy tales to your children. Don't worry, as long as you are with them they won't be frightened. This story has beautiful imagery and represents the life long bond a child has with their parent, no matter what happens. It is wonderful!"
5,Absolute best season of Project Runway,"In my opinion, this is the best season of Project Runway so far. This season has the most drama, from the problems Kieth had early on, to Jeffrey in the Mom challenge, to the trip to Paris. All of the characters are very fun and there is a nice range of styles and fashion. The challenges were really good this season as well - the dog challenge, the mom challenge, the couture challeng - there was such a great assortment of cool looks we saw during this season. Season 5 starts soon, but out of the first 4 this one is by far the best in my opinion."
3,Project Runway 3,"It arrived at my home within 2 days but once it got there and I started to watch it, I realized that it skipped on certain segments."
3,not the best season,"I'm glad I rented this third season before buying it. It is not nearly as good as the first two seasons, mainly because the guy, Jeffery, who keeps winning is such a jerk. He seems to get rewarded every time he slams someone else. Even the foul-mouthed, conniving Wendy Pepper from the 1st season is not as offensive as this guy. I have to say Santino's bluster in the 2nd season was still not as mean-spirited as this season was. Although I own the first two seasons, I won't buy this one. I've heard the 4th season is better though. So I'm waiting to see it on dvd. Even though my kids like the show very much, if the language isn't cleaned up, I won't buy it or let them watch it. (You won't hear Heidi Klum, Michael Kors, Nina Garcia or Tim Gunn using trashy language.)"
3,Love the styles not the language,"The only negative I can say about the DVD/show is that I really dislike the language, it is poorly censored and there is just an over use of the F word. Boo on those who in my mind ruined a good show. Just my humble opinion. Those who think that I am a prude might think it is my problem but I'm sorry you can clean up your language when you know a camera is on you, how you talk around your friends is your business but you are coming into my home. To talk like that narrows the amount of people that can play this around their children (at least I hope so or maybe I am the only one in the universe who thinks this)"
2,Definitely not the best season!,"I really enjoyed Season 1 and season 2 of PR and even bought them (not having cable), but I found this season very bland and uninspiring. I didn't find any of the designers particularly likable (and found one even creepy!) By the time I had watched 4 episodes a friend called me and I could only think of the name of one of the designers so, to me, that shows how forgettable this season was. I did like the work of one designer, but thought the winner was a bad choice."
3,The weakest one among the first 3 seasons,"The third season is the weakest among the first 3 seasons. The challenges are all very interesting and demanding as before. Heidi, Tim and all the judges are great. But, a great but, the contestants are far from satisfactory. One could not see as many great pieces as created by the contestants of the previous seasons, especially the first season. One does not have particular liking for the contestants of the third season."
4,buy it for the first song alone.,Slim is one of the better no limit rapperslook out for THE STREETS MADE ME....
4,Coming from a TRUE hiphop head this album is worth buying,"I'm sure I'm not the biggest no limit fan but damn this album is pretty ill. Soulja Slim got that kinda flow where you know that kat is just straight real and not fakin da funk. This album has excellent production. Soulja Slim's lyrics may not be top notch but that is just his style that is what makes Soulja Slim, Soulja Slim. Write me Back is a track I have played time and time again. There are other sick tracks on that cut too. This isnt the best No Limit album (second to Kane and Abel ""Am I My Brothers Keeper"") but this album is well above the average No Limit album. If you dont have this lp you should pick it up."
4,Soulja Slim can't be played,If you been through or seen drama then you can pick up Slim and relate. His style is raw and uncut. Though it's old now this is one of the few classic CD's out of a hand full of the no limit artists in my opinion.
5,is he the best?,"Well Master P does not deserve credit for finding Soulja Slim considering Slim was C-Murder's discovery to begin with. He appeared on the Down South Hustlers album under the name of Magnolia Slim. There is no doubt thta Slim is one of the best rappers on No Limit. His vivid wordplay ranks him up there with Mac, Mia X , and C-Murder. The album was released in early 1998. It sold well for an album with little promotion(it debuted at #13 on the Billboard pop charts selling 83,000 copies in its first week).Although Slim lacks the creativity of, say, B.G., his flows are so quick and precise that you can't help but marvel. Just look at the 1st track. Only problem is the number of guest appearances. The entire No Limit family is here. The track with Snoop was the best, but the other rappers don't sound well with Slim except for Trenitty, Mac and C-Murder.Get it, ya heard?"
4,This is the one of the best No Limit Cd's ever,"Soulja Slim, may not seem to be the best NL rapper on the tank. He's never really on many other No Limit MC albums but don't mistake that, Slim can hold is on. The beats by the pound, produce the LP which is loaded with way too may guest appearances. But none the less its a great album.With songs like '' Head Buster'', '' You Got It II'', and '' Hustlin Is A Habit'', it shows how Slim can colaporate with his No Limit tank members and make it work but, this album is loaded with tons of harsh tales of crime, and drugs. What this album lacks and what I say about most No Limit albums from the late 90's is that it has no varity and this could be any No Limit MC's LP. Especially on NL Party, with 5 guest apperances, thats way too much. The rest of this LP is great though and you can tell who Slim is. He is a great MC, but from these terms the No Limit camp was holding him down."
5,Soulja Slim is TIGHT,"yo, wuz happenin' solja's! ya'll gots to check out Give it to um' raw! i got it and have been bumpin' No limit party ever since. when i'm DJ'n out at da clubz, all my people be like, ""play no limit party! This record is the joint ya'll. so if you down wit no limit, you betta be down wit soulja slim!peace out"
2,No Limit Dud,"This album was a big disappointment for No Limit everywhere. I ain't feelin' this album at all. Only a few songs, Wootay and maybe 2 other songs caught my attention. If you're at the record store and you can get either this or another No Limit CD put Soulja Slim on the reserve list."
1,slim can't rap!!!!!!,"i thought this CD was going to tight,it was dumb!! slim can't rap!!! slim leave nolimit for ever, your making them look bad!!! you sound like a girl, b*tch!!!!!!"
4,A Diamond in the Ruff,"Master P didn't know who he had at the time until it was to late for P to sign him to the label in 01'. I knew of Soulja before this album came out and so naturally I had to get this album. Soulja's songs were different from the No Limit roster it wasn't the same i'm a soulja line, he translated the streets in real time talk and didn't hold nothing back. When C-Murder and Mac appeared on this album it was bananas. You could have had an instant group.GIVE IT 2 'EM RAW IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL"
4,BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED,"This game is great. when i got it i had my douts but when i played it they changed. The point of the game is to get the three pendants from the three palaces, then chalenge the dark wizard aghnim. then you must travel to the dark world and retreave the 7 cristales. then you fight Aghnim in Gannons tower then fight gannon in the pyrimid."
5,Incredible!,"I played it in Wal-Mart for 10 minutes and bought it! I liked it so much. If you get stuck in one player, you can take your mind of it and play with your friends... or enemies. Graphics? Great! Game Play? Even better. Throwing your friends around in multiplayer? Perfect."
4,AWESOME!,"THE BEST VIDEO GAME EVER, in my humble opinion. The GBA version is every bit as incredible as the SNES one was. Fun, challenging, engaging, this game draws you in - I could play for days and not get bored! If I could only have one game for my GBA this one would DEFINITELY be it!"
5,2 Games for the price of one,As a Legend of Zelda collector I would say this game is one of the best in terms of value. Game play is wonderful and has an extra four player mode. Recommend to anyone who is into adventure and role playing games.
5,Great Game and Shipping Speed,"For starters this game was supposed to be a used game, but this game looks like you got it out the store on opening day!"
5,good as it gets!,"This game is perfect for old school zelda players.Old fashion type game play,old graphics,just plian zelda.But wait,I dont consider myself an old school player.Heck the first zelda I played was for the n64.And I still love this game!So even if this is being played by a beginer I say go for it buy the game spend the little extra cash on it,it is well worth the hours you can put into this one game!"
5,THIS GAME ROCKSSSSS,The first time I played thissss game was when I wasssss flying over from newerk new jersey. I liked it so much I bought it for my gameboyadvance.the graphics are so amazing.though Ihavent finished it it's great!!!!!!!Whoever dosen't have this is missing out on the best game in the world!!!!!!!
5,THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!,"hi when i bought this game....the graphics are awsome!its better then any other gbc zelda game.the cool thing abou this game is that they added a new multiplayer game called ""The Four Swords"".And all u need is 1 game, a gba link cable and 4 gba's and u can have a cool adventure!So buy this game.im serious."
5,Awesome Game!,"A Link To The Past is a great game, it's pretty good graphics, and good controls (Though you can't jump.... I hate that.... I love jumping....) The sounds aren't so great, in fact, it's pretty annoying with the sound on so I always turn it off... The battles are pretty cool, yet very fast/easy, the start of the game is slightly boring, but it gets better..... MUCH better.... I haven't play Four Swords yet, but I'm sure it's awesome (Woohoo you get to throw each other!) If you want to play some VERY similar (with the same graphics and people) go to www.cyberjoueur.com (The game is called Grael) Very well then, have fun playing!Do buy this game, please"
3,I don't know,"It's not anything new, just another game that was remade for the GBA. Well the game play is fairly good, the story line is one of the best out there. Get this game if you are above the age of 10 if not don't get it, if you do you'll be really bored."
2,The SNES Version was better,I'll admit that the gameplay and graphics were incredible but the game as a whole was just to darn hard! Nearly everytime i turned around i had to go to a website to find how to get out of someplace. It's also too long. I perfer games like Mario where the levels are orginized with a map but here it's just all laid out at once and it take you ten minutes to get from one side of the world to the other. For the serious gamers(the ones who collect Pokemon cards and dress up as Link for halloween) I'd tell them to buy this but for the average games(who live a life outside of video games)I'd highly recommend Mario 2 or Yoshi's Island.
1,Waste of money,"What a waste of money, this game is the same thing as the one for the original gameboy. That one is probably half the price maybe less."
2,And a decade later it returns?,"I love Zelda games but this one was pubilshed for SNES, and GB. If you had GBs it would be useless!... Here are the ratings.Graphics 6.3Sound 9.6Hard 10.0Likeable 5.9Thats really all."
1,Buy it secondhand on internet - first hand it is 2 expensive,"anno 2004, this game is depressingly ugly to look at, so ugly that it hinders my gameplay experience. the ratings for THIS zelda are far too high and imo only based on nostalgia. I have played (u)moria for hundreds of hours, so i'm not the type that sees graphics as the most important aspect, but come on, zelda, no. link moves waaay too slow, the selection system is unintelligible. it may be that is was among the first rpg's but that does not mean it is one of the best! The story may be great but playability is too low to grab me at once (in contrast to phantasy star, which is really far better and about the same age).my advice : borrow it, and if you have no friends with gba, rent it. do not fool yourself and pay >$5 for it."
4,great game,"This Zelda game back in the early 90s made up for the 2nd game being a piece of crap. The world map is big with a light and dark world map making the game twice as big. There lots of new items like the pegasis boots for running, the master sword, and the mirror for switching to new worlds. If you did like the origonal game you will love this one. So I say you should check this game out. There is a 2nd game on this besides A Link to the past, The 4 swords. I havent played it since you need 4 friends with the game, but buying it for just A Link to the Past is still not a waste."
5,this game rocks,"this game is amazing, my dad works for nintendo and they gave him this game already and it is amazing"
5,soon to be amazing,"Finally, game after game, there is something that you can brag about having for gameboy advance. A long time ago i had the very first version of gameboy. it took 4 batteries and you had to adjust the contrast. The game I had with it: Zelda:links awakening, and to this day i havent beaten it. and its not because i suck. i can only imagine what the new zelda has evolved into. amazing graphics, bosses that take up 1/4 of the screen, weapons that would make your mom mad at your dad for letting you get it, and 5 years of gameplay."
4,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,I have beaten this game many times but it takes a long time to get to the end. It is exciting all the way through and more than once my heart has pounded. I strongly suggest this game for any Zelda lover.
3,I expect too much,I remember playing this game for about 30 seconds when I was a kid (on the SNES) and I didn't really care about it then. I figured that the pleasure the new Gamecube Zelda: Wind Waker gave me would renew my interest in the Zelda series. The graphics are lame (it being a port of the original SNES) and could have been updated to match the Four Swords graphics which are more like Wind Waker's (and much better looking/feeling). I'll stick to the scarrier Castlevania series which has never disappointed. Why didn't Nintendo make a new Zelda for GBA instead of porting the SNES one? They've been doing this a lot with the Mario series and other games. I think it is lazy. It's like repackaging our youth and selling it to us with a marked up price.
4,"fun, but the Super NES version is better","This is a really fun game. However, growing up in the early 90's, the Super Nintendo version of Link to the Past will be the one I will have fond memories of and cherish the most. Any updates are just that- updates for all the young people out there who weren't around when the classics were being released. With that said, either version is a nice addition to your video game library. Grab some hearts, battle some classic bosses, and have a ball. The adventure of a lifetime is back."
5,link is bak and betr than evr,all zelda games are great now 4 GBA they have a classic snes game this games is one of the best GBA games ive played it is the 2nd best zelda game ive played (1st is wind waker). U must get this game
5,It's Back,You know no matter how good the graphics get on the new video games systems I will always look back at the original NES as the best. Nothing beats playing a game of the original Zelda.
2,Fan Painting,"The fans are a little difficult to open and close. Once painted, you can't close them. Once good thing is they do not tear easily."
3,Fell apart before kids left the party,"I bought these for my son's 5th birthday party which was Japanese themed. The children painted them, they all broke before they left the party. The bracket at the bottom holding the wood together came out and they just fell apart. Really terrible durability. But they did hold up to paint and calligraphy ink."
1,AMAZON KINDLE EDITIONS SUCKS,"This review pertains to the Kindle Edition of the book, not to the book itself. Amazon is deluding Kindle customers - this so-called short-story collection contains just the one story, not the whole book!! At $2.55 for one short story, this is daylight robbery by Amazon. They should specify on the Kindle edition page that this is the case!"
1,Kindle version is just the one story - you get what you pay for,"Reading the other reviews I thought this was quite a deal - a 305 page book with 21 short stories for only $0.55! Unfortunately when I purchased it (no sample available, since the sample would be the entire content) I found it just contained the first story in the book. So I guess for 1/21 the cost you get 1/21 the content. Nothing wrong with that but I wish Amazon was more clear upfront that only one of the 21 stories in the paper book was included. I would suggest Amazon remove reviews of the print editions from the Kindle editions unless they are largely the same content, which this is not."
3,Robert Sawyer's Mind is great,"Loved his explanations of why the stories came about and how and where they were publisheed. He is original, and fresh and thoughtful and did I mention original.I don't care for vampires or horror so it would have a higher rating like his ""Identity Theft"" anthology"
3,Nice little trucks but...,"They seem like well made, sturdy little trucks, but the dumper part came off in the first hour of play. You can put it right back on but it keeps coming off and is going to get lost. Very disappointing."
2,Breaks apart too easily,"The trucks don't break, but the beds come off constantly. They slide right back on, but for smaller children, that means continual interruptions in play."
2,Clip,"Does not attach to my drain, as I have the opposite adapter on my drain. Since it will probably cost me more to ship it back, I'll keep it in my toolbox..."
2,Full of Mistakes,"I'm only 3 chapters into this book and the number of mistakes in it is appalling. The author consistently refers to the wrong equations, messes up derivations of essential equations (the operating line, for one), and is not very well written, either. It also is almost entirely about distillation.I will not be looking forward to the rest of the semester with this book."
3,Ok book,This is really a beginners book to reading and math. Both the reading and math are at a very beginner's level.
5,A nice way to give your sub-woofer a workout,"Musically, this is a pretty standard electro break album, and though it stands pretty well on its own as that, it really excels at directing some very clean, low, bass to your sound system. If you like electro and you love bass, this is the album for you. You and your sub-woofer will not be disappointed."
2,Not what I thought this was,"Well for the price being cheap thumbs up all the way. But having said that. I totally didn't know what I was buying. My assumption was it was a ""video"" electronic game and not a pack of video cards for a game. Rather wished I had known that when looking for cheap inexpensive electronic games for a gameboy for my special needs child. But a 5 star to seller for being quick and prompt for my order being delivered in a timely manor and packaged well. My over all review for the product it's self was not what I was looking for. But thanks anyway."
3,Skip this one unless you're under 25,I have to agree with the previous reviewer that this was not up to Frankie Jones' usual work. The story seems immature and the characters are not at all likable.
4,Fun for the kids,"This toy has both enjoyment and educational value. it also helps the children move away from the electronic toys, at least for a few moments."
4,Dog Spa,"I bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.It offers a variety of things to do, but it does run out of product soon."
2,Not what we were hoping for.,"Not really all that much fun to work on... A little too involved, and not really involving the dogs."
5,A great find.,"I had this CD years ago and it mysteriously disappeared. I was so happy to find it online. I immediately downloaded it to my computer and cellphone. I listen to it all the time. It brings back a lot of memories. My children heard me listenening to it and said they remembered the songs and loved them too. I actually have it playing on my computer as I type this. Thank you, thank you for having it available."
5,Trail Jammer Edge Product,I read other reviews which were very helpful in making a decision to buy this product. Installation was easy - results were amazing. I got great throttle response and increase in power. There was no whistling effect from the air cleaner. I feel it was a great investment and would recommend this system.
2,Lacking durability,"I've owned a pair of Vater retractable wire brush sticks for years--- they were excellent, sturdy and great sounding. After extended toll, I decided to replace them with another pair-- I mistakingly ordered these sticks (the cheaper, non-retractable model). The result: the base of the brushes became ""wobbly"" in a matter of days. The sticks still function, but they don't feel right. The solution: upgrade to the $20++ retractable sticks.I hope this forewarning helps."
3,"Mildly insightful, but not really helpful","This book had some good points and most women could probably identify with a few of the types portrayed, but in general offered no real help in the dating world."
4,Great quality for the price,I purchased the Olympus Trooper 10X50 binoculars in preparation for a vacation to Alaska. I have not been disappointed with the binoculars based on the performance that they have exhibited. Great quality & functionality for the price.
5,Great binoculars,We wanted binoculars to start bird watching and after reading many reviews I settled on these. They are very reasonably priced and the view is great. easy to adjust and handle.
5,Very powerful,This was a gift for a friend. She said it made her dizzy when viewing. (LOL) I know what she means.
4,"good quality, value for money","the quality is very good for its price, the focusing is clear and easy, viewing is comfortable and at excellent distance. the carry case is good and well padded.not giving 5 starts will be because of the strap, its thin maybe they could of added a bit of leather like the slr camera straps.I would recommend this."
2,"May be good for the kids, but...","I ordered these after reading the stellar reviews on this site. Got them in yesterday, and here is what I found.1. Very lightweight unit. This is because it is made of cheap plastic. Has no heft to it at all. I am sure that the lenses are also plastic.2. Chinese made.3. Distortion around the edges when sweeping back and forth.4. Feels very fragile. I doubt that it would survive a three foot drop onto carpet.5. Everything just has a cheap feel to it.Where oh where are the good metal frames of yesteryear?Conclusions: These are good binoculars to let the kids play with. Thats why I gave it two stars.Other conclusions: Who on earth wrote the other opinions here? Either employees of the company selling these things or people who never actually seen any other binoculars."
2,Not doing well over time,"I've had this (Gorillapod GP2-E1EN for SLRs) for 2.5 years now. It's been used occasionally, never abused, and at first did pretty well. Over time, several joints appeared to be looser than the rest. I thought it was just wear, but recently looked closely and saw that the black plastic around the circumference of the loose sockets was cracked. I removed those segments, and now have stiff legs again, but the topmost joint (the bottom of the clamp base) is also cracked, so it will no longer hold up the weight of my SLR, even with no lens.This is a weak design, and I'm hesitant to buy a new one unless they've acknowledged this issue and improved it. This one will now be relegated to use on small point and shoot, and maybe hold a strobe."
4,Joby GP-2 Gorillapod,"This is worth the price. Great value and very,very easy to use. I would recommend this highly."
1,Didn't work with Ball Head,"I purchased this item thinking that it would work with the Gorillapod Focus with Ballhead. It didn't. Apparently, this item only works with another model of Gorillapod."
5,Great grip,"This Gorillapod is sturdy enough to support my Canon A650IS, which weighs 404 grams with batteries (14 oz). The grip is stable for minutes even on somewhat slippery surfaces (horizontal plastic pipe), and on vertical metal poles, thanks to the rubber disc on each ""node"" of the pod legs.If you screw the bubble level into the base of the camera, detaching the camera from the Gorillapod and reattaching it become fast (2 seconds) and easy (just press the JOBY button and remove the camera+level).I ordered this with the ""Eco"" packaging, which was perfect - the minimal amount of carton around the product, without any plastic to wrestle with. I highly recommend this tripod and if you have a light enough camera, look for the version with magnetic feet, for extra placement opportunities. My camera has a pull-out swivel screen, which makes it great for placements in any position, at odd angles where a fixed screen on the back of the camera wouldn't be visible."
4,Fun fun,"I think this might be hard to use with a big SLR camera but it is perfect for my smaller cameras, and the balance bubble is just perfect! I am going to a place where a small tripod will be key and is on completely unlevel ground so this is the perfect gift!!"
1,Far below my expectations:,"This product may look cool in advertisement, but it is not very practical for SRL cameras. I have Nikon D70, and it DOES NOT hold very well. It can not grab on anything with D70. It doesn't even held straight up my D70. My D70 almost broke when it fell off a rock top. Even it was placed on a flat part of rock top. It works OK on my very small Canon digital elph. DO NOT recommend it to use with SRL camera."
2,Not strong enough to hold my Canon 50D,"This works great for lighter cameras, but with my Canon 50D and the 28-135mm lens it ""sags"" and won't hold the camera straight. I'm returning it."
3,"Cool tripod, can't support DSLR with flash","The Gorillapod for Digital SLR cameras can't support a medium-sized SLR with a hotshoe flash attached. I was disappointed to discover that even with some creative positioning of the legs, it just wouldn't stay up, and nearly dropped my camera on the ground.If you have a medium-sized DSLR with a hotshoe flash, you may want to get the next size up of the Gorillapod."
4,Great for baby monitor,"I bought this to hold my Philips Avent Video Baby Monitor--giving me the flexibility to position it exactly how I need it. It works great, I can get the legs in the right position and they seem to hold very well. No slipping so far. I look forward to using it with my Canon DSLR after we no longer need it for baby."
4,Works like it should,"I like how flexible this thing is and it holds my camera, Canon G7, as it should. The only downside if any is that the legs could be a bit longer. They worked perfect it is just that around larger tree branches I would feel safer if they wrapped more. Probably a mute point though."
1,2 Defective Items,"I bought one in a local brick & mortar store. The plate or ""shoe"" that attaches to the camera would not release from the tripod -- it took me 20 minutes to free my camera from it (the screw head is under the plate and inaccessible when attached to the tripod).I took it back to the store, where the friendly clerk offered to exchange it with another model from the shelf. We opened the package before I went home, and it had the exact same defect: the ""detachable"" plate or ""shoe"" would not detach from the tripod.So she gave me my money back and is shipping both back to the manufacturer as defective.Fail."
2,NOT FOR SLR cameras,"the nob on the hotshoe is very stiff and difficult to fasten/unfasten and I ended up breaking it trying to unlock it. If you are thinking to have one these for you SLR Camera then DON'T get this one. Even the larger ones are not reliable enough to risk putting your camera on with awkward sort of positioning.The other main failure with this mini tripod, it keeps wobbling for ever due to the flexibility of its bendable legs."
3,love gorilla pods,"This is my second garilla pod I bought it because I wanted to use a second camera in odd locations using the pod. My first one I boughtwas rated at just over 7 pounds and worked great for my 7d with smaller lenses on it and worked great for my xsi with any of my lenses.This one however can only hold my XSI with a 50mm or 35mm lens on it. I tried with my EF 17-40 f/4L and I did a not want to hold itwhere I wanted it at all. I was going to return it but now my parents took it and I will be buying the heavier rated pod again.all and all if you have a light DLSR or point and shoot camera you were thinking about getting this for, it will meet all expectations.They are great for travel nice and small, all around I love them as a go anywhere tripod."
5,Great.!!,Great product. Ease of use. Fits everywhere with a good grip. Compact enough to carry along everywhere. Bubble level also helps a lot.
3,* Doesn't fit all Gorilla pods *,Note that this clip only fits the GP2....I have a GP3 and a GP1 that it won't fit.It would be much better to fit all models!
3,"does a good, not great job","Pros:very light and portablesupports P&S;'s easily; will work with a light DSLR and small zoom if the angle is not too extremeWill allow perspectives unavailable/unattainable with conventional tripods and mini fixed leg tripodsCons:legs are kinda fiddly, you'll have to adjust the legs many times because as you move the camera to compose the shot the legs will loosen.Make sure your legs are FIRMLY wrapped around SMOOTH objects, O/W the whole rig may SLOWLY rotate or slipOVERALL:reasonably priced camera accessory which will do things you can't O/W do; small, flexible and light enough to carry along in a large pocket or jammed into a crowded bag"
2,Not strong enough for a dSLR,"Seems like it should work well, but it's just not strong enough for my Nikon D90 with kit lens. Sitting flat on the table, it's okay, but even then, if you want to angle it up or down, the legs start to slide out from under it. And I just would not trust it wrapped around a pole or something. Probably my fault for choosing the wrong model.Will work great with a little point-and-shoot. That's probably what I'll use it for."
5,Fantastic companion for my Canon SX1,"I purchased this Gorillapod with my new camera, a Canon SX1 IS. This camera is almost the size of a DSLR, being a megazoom, and this stand is excellent. The joints are stiff enough to hold most shapes, but not unweildy, and you can wrap them around things if that's your only option to get the shot.It's also much smaller of course than a full tripod, so it's easy to throw into a camera bag (if it's not tiny) or even a cargo pants pocket.Just be sure to get the right Gorillapod for your camera. There's several sizes, and the smallest will certainly not work if you've got a big DSLR with a telephoto or anything like that."
3,Gorillapod Review,This item would have benefited with a swivel mount for the camera. This would have made it much easier to level the camera.
2,Better buy a remote too...,"shaky shaky shaky. if you buy this tripod, you better have a remote or you photos are going to be a blurry mess. The neck has no stability! Also i wouldn't wrap the legs around anything too high off the ground. Not the most reliable grippers and joints."
4,Convenient,Easy to carry around a sturdy enough for a real camera. Won't hold a candle to a real tripod but it is so small and light you have no reason not to carry it in your camera bag.
3,Not totally tested yet,"I bought this item for a trip we were going on, but the trip has been postponed. I have not had the opportunity to truly test or use this item. I have played with it for a few minutes only to see if it is at all what I wanted, it appears to be and I think I will be happy with it. I do not feel I can judge it until further use. I do not think I will be disappointed though."
5,Great!,I have these (and the others that came after in the series) and I really love them. For once the compilers have dug a little deeper and given us a decent number of rare gems instead of the same old hits we always see on these compilations. (Although there are a lot of the usual hits as well) I know they have to sell these things with the hits (and I love them too)but it's great to see something a little different here. Bravo Time Life!
5,Secrets of Holt House,"I thoroughly enjoyed this mystery book and would definitely recommend this one to mystery readers. The characters are well developed and the author really keeps your interest as the suspense and intrigue develops. I would also recommend Big Trouble for a Little Lady...a detective story with alot of action and romance..like the movie ""L.A. Confidential""The author has a definite style!!"
1,Useless,"I ordered this crate pad thinking it would be easier to keep clean than the big pillows I was using, well it is paper thin & bunches up every time my dogs step into their crates, so they're sleeping on the hard plastic crate liner instead. I even noticed my jack russell shivering in the middle of summer b/c this didn't hold in any body heat. Within 2 days they were finding their old beds in our spare room & climbing over boxes to snuggle up in them again. They were clearly unhappy with this replacement. On the 3rd day these were thrown in the closet- what a waste of money!!"
3,It's good but needs work,"I kind of enjoyed Daz album. Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back and seems pretty cool for the west coast. Since I'm from the east the beats on the album is pretty tight. However the album falters in some ways such as too and I do mean too much guest appearances and limited topics. The list of guest appearances are quiet annoying and there are only two tracks that are with only Daz. Also, limited topics such as playas, gangstas, and negativiity are pretty boring. However, the album is different from the Dogg Pound. I really think Daz has potential to be the one of the best producers in the West. Daz beats are superb and are balanced pretty well. Maybe Daz can do beats for some of the east coast MC's. Although his lyrics are not as strong as his beats, the album gets four and 1/2 stars beatwise and I personally put Daz as part of the phattest producers besides Primo, Dr.Dre, Pete Rock, the Hieroglyphics producers, and the Beatminerz"
5,VERY OVERLOOKED ALBUM! (MY Name Is O.I),"This album was tight. Intiated should be a tight song on the radio everyday. BUT it wasn't. It was with 2pac, for petes sake. It was a good album. My favorite track was O.G. It was very tight. But I should say after this, Death Row lost its touch. Afyter this album, every other Death Row album was dumb. After 2pac died, they were still tight (Gang Related, Necessary Roughness, and This CD was good)But Michel'le's stupid Hang Jury was abolutely crappy. Tha Row is a cruddy name. The only good Death Row albums aftr this album are the damn compilations."
3,3.5 stars,Daz's debut solo is and average release. it has its moments and its drawbacks. i like he keeps it around the dogg pound vibe and the lyrics are okay. Production is average and the guest are good. it worth checking out and giving it a good listen to.rating B
2,OK,"OK. This album I bought because I enjoy my gangster rap and have heard Daz guesting on ""Doggystyle"". Boy was I dissapointed with this one. Although he appears more than able to rhyme on ""Doggystyle"", and produce for various Death Row releases he just didn't seem able to translate his obvious talent into a quality CD. The beats on this album are especially poor and elementary. The rapping is in no way great, and finally the guest appearances don't help to save this poor effort. The only anomaly is ""In California"", which is a very good song with a bumbing beat, a nice chorus and decent rapping. This however does not make up for this dire attempt of a solo album. Hopefully this mistake will allow Daz to learn and provide us with some nice tunes to bounce our heads to.All in all, you would be best of buying ""N.W.A. Legacy"" as you get Daz's best song and a whole load more."
4,Straight DPG.,"It's a bombazz album.. But I think da next one will be much better. My favorite tracks: 5,10,15 Now it's time 4 a new DPG Record. Soopafly, wat up?"
3,3.5 stars for Daz Dillenger's first solo spot.......,"This joint was released after Death Row was dismantled and everyone went their seperate ways. Daz was the only recognizable survivor of the Death Row dynasty left. So obvious the results of this joint is mixed. My personal favorite cut on here is ""It might sound crazy"" with Nate Dogg on the hook."
5,Best damn game out there!,"I just bought my XBox and was looking for some good games. I went to a site that rated them and found this one on there w/ a 9.6 out of 10 rating. So I went around to various places looking for the game, nobody had it. Found a recon one online and bought it. Just like other reviewers say about this game, once you start to play...you CAN'T STOP! This is truly one of the most addicting games I have ever played. The best part is when you completely wipe out other teams that are ""bad ... Marines"" or ""Jail hardened convicts"", etc. One note, LOTS OF FOUL LANGUAGE! Not for the kiddies."
3,A disappointment,"After reading the reviews of this game at sites such as gamespot I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Unfortunately the reviews did not do the game justice as I was extremely disappointed.The problems with the game are as follows.The computer controls to much of the game. Many times you will win, or lose, a game and not realize exactly why.The graphics are poor. That's not to say that they are Kabuki warriors poor but they are definitely not what you would expect from an Xbox game.The camera is cumbersome. Because of the size of the game board as well as the speed the games moves out many times you are not sure where the disc is. Additionally, by the time you find it the computer, or one of your teammates has already scored.The game is a very cool concept and could be better but they need to slow it down as well as vastly improve the graphics and the AI so that the player can make the difference in the game."
5,Chris's Game Reviews 5: Deathrow is unbelievable!,"Deathrow is the coolest sports game of all time! It's virtual reality high-action. You can pass the ball to others and shoot in the portal. Hint: Once you've scored, you might wanna have another player on the other side to score again! It's really cool and my favorite team is the Nukeheads. I always beat the Crushers and I just beat the Sea Cats not too long ago. You have to sub player sometimes and if you're playing split screen, you might wanna have 1 person go around and injure players and have another guard the goal. I really suck at it but I'm getting better. I would like anyone that lives in VA, to come to my joint and play it with me. See what happens! I'll probably do Blinx next and look for my guide Christopher Williams's Holiday Guide 2002."
4,Second Time Around,"Fighting bitterness over the 8 wasted years since their broken engagement, both Emily and Kevin still have an unquenched love for each other. Carol Steward illustrates well the emotions on both sides and the underlying struggles of their unforgotten love. But it takes a child, not their own, to teach Kevin what is most important in life. You'll want to read the book in one sitting."
2,not a good study guide,"I bought this book to study for the DANTES test on Civil war and reconstruction. It was of minimal help. Its a great book if what you are interested in is battle plans, tactics, and a pretty good analysis of each and every battle. The DANTES exam just wanted to know who fought what battle and where, and had questions on Copperheads, fireaters, KKK,and the Lincoln and Johnson administrations that are only glanced it in this book. This is a book about the Civil WAR. To review for the DANTES test find a book about the Civil War and the Civil War ERA.Since this is the first book I've ever read that was exclusively about the Civil War, I wasn't too sure if 90% of the Southern Generals really were war geniuses and 90% of the Union Generals were compelete idiots, which is how it seems in this author's analysis. The South received more complimentary language than the North. I felt that the author was slightly biassed toward the South."
1,NEO-CONFEDERATE BIAS,"The author leans heavily towards the racist White South and misrepresents Union personalities. Southerners are ""brave heroes"" while Union men are ""one-time store clerks and errand boys"". It's hard to believe that the author is a loyal American."
2,A Misleading Title,"Yes, there are some sex scenes in this movie but its story is not well structured. It drags on and one wonders what is the purpose. It is the story of a young couple. The guys takes amateurish pictures of their love making. These pictures are accidentally found by a voyeur/dealer. The young photographer and his work are introduced to an agent resulting in a photo exhibition. The girl comes to the exhibition and sees the pictures, gets upset and leaves her boyfriend. But soon they both find out that they can't live without each other and they get back together. If you are buying this DVD expecting to see something related to the title of the movie, you wont be disappointed because there are a couple, or three. But you have to be very patient not to get bored."
2,adolescent tedium,"Tedious, adolescent, shallow, tacky. Just makes you more uncomfortable than aroused.I would rather recommend ""Mon Amour"" by Tinto Brass. At least you will see beautiful shots, be amused, entertained and stimulated. You will see that ""this could never happen in real life""...but that is what makes Mon Amour work.All that is missing in this film are talented script writers, cameramen, directors, location, and actors. But you CAN benefit by learning how not to make a film."
1,Chnese Junk is not a boat,"Having been around shop machinery all my life (65 years) I knew I was in trouble when I uncrated this thing. China makes weird looking motors. They don't look like American, Japanese, or Taiwanese motors. They are not NEMA motors. They look like Chinese motors and act like Chinese motors and are very often troublesome. As was this one.It burned up as soon as I plugged it in.Amazon is taking it back and I do want a replacement just to see what the rest of the machine is about. If the spindle runs true and it makes nice holes and the motor doesn't burn up I will come back and write another review. Until then.... watch out! It is risky"
1,How bad drill press can be?!,"Three months of the use and a conversation with service center representative.""When will my drill press be fixed?""""Not earlier than 3 weeks.""""Why it takes so long!""""We ordered PARTS; motor, chuck and post""This is for you Delta. When customer service confesses that there is quality control problem, then you have grim picture. It is not about this drill press, I have FOUR returned Delta products. They really live on reputation of Unisaw, don't they."
3,How Do You Save This CD?,"When I bought this CD, I knew and loved their three singles: How to Save a Life, Over My Head (Cable Car), and Look After You. I thought ""hey, I love these songs, the cd is surely full of gems like these!"" But when I got home and listened to it, every song sounded the same. Same piano, slow tempo, sad, sensitive lyrics. I literally wasn't even sure if a new song had begun or not without checking what track it was on. In the end, I wish I'd just bought the 3 songs I already liked-- there was nothing else that stood out to me on the cd. It's fine, it's nice, it's calming... but it's boring, too."
4,Easy going,"I like this CD in the background at work or in the car when I just kind of zone. The proffesional review states that each song sounds alike, which is true, they due kind of blend together. I however disagree that the album is ""bland"" as she so states. It is just a mellow sound that easy easy to listen to. I do hope that they try to expand their sound in the future though.I'd buy another one of their CDs."
4,very listenable tracks,"I spend most of my time in Europe, so I don't get too much exposure to up and coming bands. By chance on a recent trip home I heard The Fray on one of the 'Top 40' programs. I liked what I heard, sampled a few tracks online, and bought the music. While I might agree with the numerous reviews that say many of the Fray's songs sound similar, I still enjoy them. I recommend giving a listen to the Fray and look forward to seeing what comes next from them."
5,great stuff!,"If you are into this melodic indie/emo rock pop thingyy lol!You are gonna love the fray, every song in this albums it`s simply brilliant, very easy to listen at diverse situations I`m really enjoying their music.If you wanna know how they sound like, well, if you are familiar with Dishwalla, or Augustana and you like it you`ll be just fine.I honestly this is the kind of album that ain`t going to bother a diverse background of listeners at a road trip ;-)"
5,Masterpiece,"After hearing only 1 song from their album, I was automatically addicted. Their music flows along the trend of today's popular music but seems to have a deeper message. I love the Fray to death, they're aweseom."
4,good group,altho not the best group out there in the world they did some stuff that they will always be remembered for
4,How to Save a Life,"On first listen I discounted this album, feeling it to be very samey the whole way through. But with repeated listening you really get a feel for the music on offer and realise there is a lot more depth and feeling behind it than originally meets the eye. Of course you get the major hit 'How To Save A Life', but one of my favourites has to be 'Over My Head' which I'll often put on repeat and turn my stereo up loud for! There is a great mix of piano playing, solid song-writing and inspiring lyrics here and my main advice is to give it a go and to give it a fair chance, you shouldn't be disappointed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Strong Debut,This is a solid but not great album. The two main singles are Over My Head and How to Save a Life. Both songs got alot of airplay and will be familar to any buyer of this album. I imagine in 10 years from now How to Save a Life will still be played. The problem that I have with this album is it sounds too polished and too commercial it missing the raw sound of an up and coming band. It is great back background music and is worth the money (less than $9 what a great deal) it will make a great addition to any collection.
4,melancholy melody,"The story from ""How to save a life"" is what got me to buy the CD. If you are interested google them and read about it. The whole CD is inspiring and nice. It is definitly a road trip CD. enjoy!"
5,The next best group!!,"Never have I come across a CD where almost every song appealed so much to me. You will really enjoy the music. They are AMAZING =)The best songs are ""How to save a life"" ""She is"" ""Fall Away"" and ""Look after you"""
4,18 year old daughter loves it,My daughter listens to this cd alllll the time! I think she only watches Gray's Anatamy to hear them sing sometimes!Even I like to hear this cd and I'm 53! LOL
4,not bad at all,The CD itself was amazing I mean I seriously can not stop listening to it. It came exactly as described by the seller and I have nothing bad to say about it.
1,Bland and Uninspiring,"I just don't understand the hype associated with this label. The two songs they play over and over and over on (Christian!) radio are about as lyrically uninspiring and bland as they come. The lead singer's voice sounds like he's overdosed on sedatives as he mumbles from one line to the next. ""With eight seconds left in overtime, she's on your mind""??? Huh? I've heard funeral music that has more life than this."
4,Album starts off well then fades...,"By now, most people who listen to alternative rock have heard of these guys. If you are reading this, then you want to know ""Do I really want this album?"". I think if you like the genre of music a lot (like Coldplay, Blue October, Keane), the go ahead and give this album a try. If you just like one of their songs, consider downloading that song and a couple more (chose from tracks 1 - 6 for more upbeat melodies and after for slower ones). The album tended to grow on me but is still not one I listen too all that often because of many of the songs sounding very similar."
3,Doesn't live up to the single,"It's hard -- after hearing their current single ""Over My Head"" or the emotional ""How To Save A Life"" -- not expect big things from The Fray's new album. ""Over My Head"" will hit your with their catchy style and sing-along chorus, while ""How To Save a Life"" will hook you with it's smart, unique lyrics. Unfortunately, the rest of the album falls short. With the exception of ""Look After You"", the rest of the songs lack true luster. They have no edge, aren't very catchy, and sound identical. Stream the whole album to see if it is your kind of music, but don't just buy this album on their current hit, or you will be very disappointed."
5,Awesome!,I love this CD! The Fray has a different and distinct style that brings variety to 21st century music. I love the more acoustic feel to the music and this CD never gets old!
3,Surprisingly Good,"To call The Fray ""huge"" would be a drastic understatement, but in 2005 they were practically unknown outside of Colorado, which is what makes the sheer quality of 'How To Save A Life' so surprising. Their sound, while not groundbreaking, is undeniably refreshing. Their lyrics are excellent. Their codas are out of this world. Some of these songs are downright beautiful, but while there isn't a single bad one on the entire album, some do start to sound the same after a while. Isaac Slade's forced delivery may turn off some listeners, but singing along to the superb words should not be a problem.Standout tracks: How To Save A Life, Heaven Forbid, Vienna"
5,Distinguishable to me!,"This is the first review I've ever posted, and I'm doing it because I think this CD is incredibly good. Isaac Slade's vocals reach right inside you. And what's this about the songs being indistinguishable from one another? If I'd heard ""Over My Head"", ""Look After You"", and ""Little House"" covered by different artists, I would never have guessed that they were by the same songwriters. That said, it's true that the band has a sound all its own, and I'm looking forward to hearing it develop."
5,"The Fray - A New ""How To"" on ""Saving the Music""","The Fray - How to Save A Life.This CD brings life back into the music industry. The bands soothing piano and guitar rhythms along with its sophisticated blend of rock and alternative it sure to make an impression. The lead singers voice resembling that of David Gray can only add value to this CD. Though the CD has a lifting undertone, its lyrics bring a smile to your face, and you just cannot help but to sing along. I get lost into the music and don't find my way out until it stops. Their new style of music provides and way out of the old black and white sounds. With songs like ""Over My Head"" and ""How to Save a Life"" only add to this experience of sound, rock, and a new genre, good music! From beginning to end, you just cannot let go of this CD. With other titles like ""She is,"" ""Look After You,"" and ""Heaven Forbid"" only contribute to this journey of music. This CD is definitely a jump-start for good and new music."
5,amazing,"i guarantee you will absolutely fall in love with this cd. the lyrics are so good it makes you want to cry, and no im not emo. even if youre a rap fan, a country fan, a hip hop fan, you will connect with this cd. this is what music is all about. i love every single song off this album, especially ""how to save a life"" ""she is"" and ""vienna"" the fray's music is purely amazing. i have faith that they will go down as one of the best bands ever. trust your instinct and just give this cd a chance its the best $10 you will ever spend"
4,Melodic Storytelling That Rocks,"While it's always dangerous to compare bands, I will say that musically you will probably enjoy these guys if you like Five for Fighting, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows, or Augustan. I'm not saying they're the same, but they all have male leads and an ability to deliver strong messages in catchy, melodic rock songs that are consistently easy to take.A collection of short stories about trying to figure out life and other people, I can't say whether or not the songs on this album reflect true stories from the bands' lives, but they certainly sound deeply personal, and easy to relate to.My favorites are ""She Is,"" ""Over My Head (Cable Car),"" ""Heaven Forbid,"" and ""Little House."" I especially like the integration of piano work with a slightly rough-edged guitar. The new TV staple, ""How to Save a Life"" is growing on me, but more as pop background than as something meaningful.All in all, you can't go wrong with this one."
5,Cynics,"I read these reviews with a grain of salt. Granted they sound a bit like Coldplay, but have taken a slightly different path. When did that become a sin? Bottom line is you like what you like, and as far as I know Coldplay didn't write their songs for them. Every artist before plays influence on future artists. So cynics out there keep your negative thoughts to bands that are truly awful. Personally, I love this CD...very listenable."
1,Awful awful band.,"You've heard it right: every song sounds exactly the same on this album.The singer sounds like a drunker version of Richard Patrick (of the band Filter). And I can't hear the beginning of ""How To Save A Life,"" without thinking of the Styx song, ""Come Sail Away.""Complete tripe."
1,Whew! These Guys Su-u-uck,"A triumph of mediocrity, it's like Wonder Bread licking ""Grey's Anatomy."" I actually forgot the music as I was listening to it--underwhelming, empty, and corporate radio friendly. The samples say it all. Yikes!"
4,theyre ok,i only heard cable car on the radio and i thought that they were a pretty good band but uppon further investigation i realized that they soung exactly like coldplay
1,no fray,this is not as good as a band as people want to believe and they didnt make me fall in love with anything but my radio dial!
4,Above Average,"After listening to this album several times over, I find it to be a soulful and underrated peiece of music. The Fray started out with their mega hit Over My Head(Cablecar) and those with working stereos will tell you that the song was played on almost every station, and for good reason. An album soon surfaced with more soft rock/pop that would spawn the other hit How To Save A Life. Much like their predecessors the ever popular Goo Goo Dolls and Matchbox Twenty with their soft beats and heartfelt lyrics, the music is enough to leave you humming it long after the song has finished. Some other stand outs on the album are Dead Wrong, Vienna and She Is. Although it is not the most earth shattering material to be put out there, it is worth the money if just for the simple fact that it's relaxing to listen to and leaves you happier. The bottom line is those looking for an alternative to most of the so called ""music"" out there, this is it."
3,I don't get it....,"...I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. I find nothing about this album compelling...granted the lead singer's got a nice voice, but most of the songs all sound similar, like they could be the theme song to some new, earnestly emotional TV show. The pacing of the songs doesn't seem to change much, the hooks don't hook me, there's nothing unique or particulary interesting to my ears.Not to put them down...the band has chops, they're tight enough, the album is well produced....it just strikes me as what you'd hear on mainstream pop rock radio - most of which doesn't interest me. As for the comparisons to Coldplay and David Gray....I'd say that's a bit of a stretch, although I'm sure the Fray could both artists' song quite well."
2,This is supposed to be considered good music?,"I can't believe there are enough people out there with bad enough taste in music that this album would be in the Top 40. All of the songs sound exactly the same - they all sound like a rip off of Coldplay and other similar bands.How someone could sit and listen through 12 mediocre songs is beyond me. There is nothing new about the Fray, they have just hopped on the bandwagon of other wimpy pop groups with no serious musical ability.The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it was PRODUCED and MARKETED well, and I respect that. It was produced to sound exactly like all of the other junk on the radio, and marketed well to the people who listen to that junk.I really hope you could find something better to listen to than this."
1,How to mumble to try to cover up bad lyrics and songwriting...,"It's amazing the levels of mediocrity that can spawn heavy radio rotation and hundreds of Amazon reviews. This sounds like Ben Folds in the initial phases of songwriting, mumbling through a rough idea, before moving on to expand lyrics, melodies and arrangements. The lead singer mumbles because he knows that he can't write lyrics!! How anyone would buy this is beyond me. The 2 songs I've heard from this band and the samples on Amazon are enough to clinch the title of bad band of the year for ""The Fray""."
1,"You have to be ""there""","The Amazon editorial says it all....only more nicely than what I was thinking when I heard this recording. It brought to mind the whinning of a tired pre-schooler. Fortunately, it was a gift, and there is a 'buy/sell' shop not too far from me.I highly recommend playing the listening 'samples,' before acquiring this recording -- Especially if you are over 35 years of age!"
4,Enjoy with caution...,When I first heard 'Over My Head (Cable Card)' I immidiatly wanted to know who the band was. The Fray's cd is a very well done debut cd. It is one of those cds you play if you had a long day at the office or are spending time with a friend or significant other if you need some nice background music. The songs are easy to listen to and soothing and beleive me we all need this kind of music in our lives even us headbangers.Still...I am concerned for this band for one reason. I think The Fray is trying way to hard to sound like Coldplay. The use of the piano and soft sounding lyrics with the occassional hooky guitar is tell me yea we are trying to make it big but to some extent on the coattails of a more successful band.This is an album that will probably get mixed reviews from the masses but if The Fray wants to remain around for a long time I beleive they need to really prove they can create a sound all their own and really make their mark in the music world.
4,really good,"No album is perfect, let's just admit that. But really beyond just being catchy, when u listen to a lot of the lyrics they really take u to a place where the song resonates with some memory. The album is guartanteed to make you feel.All that being side all the songs are likeable,so much that you could be imagine almost every song beiong on some show or movie soundtrack. My standout songs are ' Over my head', ' Little House', 'How to Save A life' and ' Look After You'. Trust me on a whole even the whole soft rock thing is really strong now, the album is not all fluff. ' She Is' and 'All at Once' are really poopy and might be too much so for some people, but they're still alright.But all in all despite those failings the album is really strong.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that as I said no album is perfect and I don't see an option to give 4.5 stars."
5,This record is something you need to have in your life.,"Since the day I got the CD, I just cannot stop listening to it.The more you listen to it, the more you love the music.From the begining to the end of the record, the distinctive and very smooth voice of Isaac Slade, the lead vocalist is just amaging. The sounds of the piano he plays are not like someone else's music. He is a very talented musician and an artist.Also the drummer of the band, Ben Wysocki is now one of my favorite drummers. If you listen to the song,""Look After You"", you will see what I mean. His quiet but powerful sound will take you to a totally different world with the singing of Slade.Sometime worlds are just useless to explain something what people to know.This reocrd is worth to buy and to spend your time to listent to."
4,Simply great!,"If you love action soundtracks, then this is the one to get to add to your collection. It's very hard to believe this is coming from a game. It's made me wonder what the game must be like, with so much action music and intensity blasting through the speakers.Usually you would have to wait until the ""summer movies"" came out to find the really cool, and inspring soundtracks to be released that were filled with action and heart pounding adrenaline.Game soundtracks now, simply fill that gap. DOn't think that this soundtrack is all digital, campy or synthetic in its sound. It feels and sounds like a full blown orchestra. The budget for the music production must have been robust.Pick it up, you will not regret it."
3,Weed Eater Blower/Vac,"The weight and performance of the weedeater itself, is very good. However, the bag that is furnished for vacuum, is really bad. On second use, the zipper broke, the same problem I had with previous one I owned. They need to redesign zipper with making sure it is stronger and goes straight across. The bag throws out a lot of dirt, which is bad for your respiration and cleanup."
3,Basically good product but design and instructions need improvement,The assembly instructions were confusing and in very small print--went to the Weed Eater web site where the illustrations were much better. Why would you need a screw driver to convert from blower to vac? Couldn't the designer come up with an installed lever or button to do the trick? Other than those complaints the product works as advertised and the price with free shipping beat local stores by 15-20%.
1,Not Worth a Penny,"I've had problems with a leaf blower from this company and you can forget customer service. From the start of the conversation the woman refused to be of any assistance since my warranty had expired. They just want you to buy a new blower. The rude tech would not help me troubleshoot or offer any type of guidance on getting this machine to work and didn't acknowledge that the model had this problem and she refused to allow me to speak to someone else. I have NEVER been treated so rudely and disrespectfully by a company that I had patronized. DON'T buy from Weed Eater or any associated brand (Poulan, Cub Cadet, McCullouch)."
3,"Decent machine but loud,cumbersome","I bought this from Lowe's after reading the good reviews in Consumer Reports. I've had it for about two or three years and after only a few uses, the zipper on the vacuum bag broke. Zipper is very cheaply made. Converting the machine from a blower to a vac and vice versa is more difficult than it should be. It's loud, but they all are. If you use anything thicker than a 14 gauge power cord, you cannot utilize the cord holder on the machine and the cord will fall off the plug after a short time of use and the machine will of course cut off. So... you'll have to hold the cord and the machine with one hand. This is a pain in the a$$! It does blow/suck hard enough to move leaves like it supposed to and I guess if you are careful enough with the zipper and don't mind the aggravating conversion and power cord issue, then it's ok, at best. Once again, Consumer Reports missed the mark by highly recommending this. It's an average to below average product."
4,Like Holding Onto A Hurricane,This blower does just what the product description says it will do. Blows trash and leaves. No b/s'n around.
1,Disappointing,"I bought this blower solely on the Weed Eater brand name. It had about the same specs as my old one of a different brand (which I could no longer find). The new one is louder, has more vibration, and less intensity than the old one. Those characteristics were observed independently by my wife and myself. Try another brand."
4,Weed Eater #GA2010 Rain Gutter Blower Attachment,"I bought this blower simply because I wanted one that could utilize the gutter attachment.The blower works fine, about the same as the large electric Toro I have. I think the Toro is more powerful, but noisier."
2,Not that powerful,I bought this based on the other reviews and I am disappointed in the power of this. The mulching is slow and not worth the effort. I will be looking to get a gas one with more power and will give this to my son to play with as a toy.
4,A Present,I purchased this for my daughter.. Since she seems to like it but i don't use it on my hair I gave it a 4..
3,The Dukes before Roscoe got weird,In these early eps James Best's Roscoe P. Coltrane character was a tough avenging angel lawman. Later eps he believes in the tooth fairy.
3,Can someone turn up the volume please?,"Decent box set, although this show is not as good as I remember. Corny, overacted 70's characters (especially the girls who guest star). The volume is way too low, the picture good. Obvious overdubbing from the original dialogue in at least one episode. Nice to have overall, though. I recall (as a kid) liking the 2nd season too, but after that, it was all downhill."
2,Its all relative...no pun intended,Loved this show when I was eight. Couldn't make it through one episode as an adult...truly unwatchable. So take it for what it is: simplistic goofball surrealistic vaudeville with bad acting and pacing. But sometimes you have to indulge your nostalgic itch! Put this in the same class as Knight Rider and Land of the Lost.
3,Looking for Jessi,I thought Jessi Colter would actually appear on this video. That is why I wanted to view it. However I always love Waylon's rich voice and there was a bit of a plot. My grandson will probably enjoy the action!
4,Edgier than I remembered!,"Perhaps because I remember very little from the 70's anyway, what with the consumption of... well, never mind that now. The pilot, first on the disk, is surprisingly edgy, witty, and well done. The rest of the first season rolls on nicely, but after 4 or 5 of the episodes, filming moved back to the west coast and some of the charm was lost. Still, a worthwhile retrospective on a classic TV show."
4,"great show, great set!","I was a young kid when ""Dukes"" premiered and this collection brought back lots of memories. The show does not seem dated at all. It can be a little too silly at times, but that's no big deal; I think the mix of action and comedy is why it was such a big hit. There are not many extras, which was disappointing. Otherwise, this is a great collection. If you're a fan of the show like I am, or just curious to see what the fuss was about, buy this collection and go for a ride with the Duke boys."
5,I love this show!,"Dukes of Hazzard was one of the best shows of the 70s and I sure miss them when they went off the air. It would be great if they all came back again and maybe, if done right, new casts."
5,"Them Dukes, Them Dukes..................","I remember being a kid waiting for Friday to come so that I could watch my favorite show ""Dukes Of Hazzard"". This show crossed racial boundaries big time."
5,Perfect,Please see my review of The Dukes Of Hazzard the complete third season. That review covers this product as well. Thank You!
1,Yikes!,Wow. Somehow I remembered this as being good as a kid. Not so much as an adult. This was junk and a waste of money.
4,No doubt an excellent season of tv but mono sound,"The content is excellent of course. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was the sound.I thought it was weird that the audio was only coming out of the center speaker all of a sudden. This has never happened to me.I thought my stereo was misconfigured. But the dvd is in 2.0 mono. you could have it play from the L and R speakers too. Ususally I can get it to play on all the speakers anyway but not this time.But if you raise the volume enough, it is fine."
5,The Dukes Rock My World!!!,"The Dukes are back! The complete first season is everything you would imagine it to be. It's AWESOME! Woo Hoo, I want to kiss Daisy Duke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Great picture transfer, CRAPPY sound","I'm a huge dukes fan, and as such I feel that $30 is a great deal for 3 double sided dvd's full of all things duke. However the releasing company *really* dropped the ball by only offering 1 channel dolby digital surround (and that one channel is *very* quiet.) To save those of you with decent systems a bit of time and aggravation, the best sound quality I've found so far is having the dvd player downmix the dolby digital into pcm (under the player's audio menu), and then applying whatever sound field you want at the receiver level. For me, the best sound was 5 channel stereo.Once again, *GREAT* picture transfer, I just hope season 2 offers better sound (and for 1 channel sound, I have to deduct 1 star, if the visuals weren't so nice the duke boys would have missed a jump.)"
1,POS will never purchase used dvd's again!,The dvd set arrived in a timely manner but the first two discs were so scratched up that I could not even watch them. Every episode had imperfections or scratches that caused the show to either stop completely or played choppy and erratic. I am sure there are some trustworthy sellers out there but I would never purchase from this one again. They obviously do not check out their dvd's before selling them. What a waste! Thanks for nothing and wasting my money! Shame on you!
1,Most disappointing transaction,"This DVD was supposed to be a two-disc set; one disc was missing. Case was scratched and had sticker residue. I thought buying used would be okay because I have plenty of used DVD's (opened and watched) that are in much better condition than this, especially for the price I paid. I was disappointed in the condition, but when I discovered the missing disc, I was mad. This is my most disappointing Amazon.com transaction, but thank goodness they are very good to work with for returns."
3,pretty lame entertainment,"If you found this series very lame entertainment when it first aired,do not buy it now. It is about as stupid a show as can be and it didn't impress when I was 24 and it does the same at 57."
5,"Possom on the gum' bush, the Dukes are on DVD","WOW!!!!! This is the best DVD series ever!!!!!! I can't wait until the second season comes out!!!If you haven't bought this yet, you don't know what you are missing!!!!"
5,Dukes of Hazard Complete First Season,Bought DVDs for Grand Kids. They love it. Watch them over and over.
5,The Dukes of Hazzard - The Complete First Season,This was bought for a birthday gift for a child and he loves it.
5,As good as you remember,"The Dukes were a weekly treat for any child in the 70's/80's. It is great to have these shows to watch now as an adult, and know they're still great. Dukes is a family show, which I am thankful when you see what's on TV these days. The good ol' boys still rock! These DVD's will take you back to a moment in your childhood you probably will not want to leave."
5,Passing the Torch - From one Duke's Generation to the Next,"I recently bought this set and couldn't wait for it to get here. I remember watching the ""Dukes"" on Friday nights when I was a boy. Now, I have the opportunity to share the ""Dukes"" with my son and he loves it! It was good, clean family entertainment. We watch a few episodes each night and he looks forward to this new ritual. I hope WB decides to make the follow-on seasons available so we can continue to enjoy the high-octane, high-flyin', shuckin' and jivin' so many grew fond of in 1979. I recommend this DVD set to anyone who remembers the ""Dukes"" and wants to ""Pass the Torch"" to the next generation of ""Dukes"" fans."
3,"Great show, Did not expect the Curse Words","We received the DVD last week, and I have only watched the first five episodes. I was disappointed that the first five episodes (all that I have watched thus far) contain at least one curse word, sometimes two - three. The first couple of episodes were a little racy, but I have already seen this toned down in the next three. As I purchased this for family viewing, I hope that the language gets better as the episodes continue. I will probably discard the first disc (three disc in the package) because of this.Other than the racy first two episodes and the language in the first five (and I haven't viewed the rest yet), I love this show!"
1,THAT'S IT! I'M LEAVING THE COUNTRY!,"People are offended at the cursing, but not the racism? Forget it...I quit. I'm outta here. See you in Frisco."
1,THE MOST RACIST SHOW ON TV,"Entertaining show, for country rednecks. This series was the most racist show on tv, from the confederate flag,down to the #@%@ car named the General Lee after the founder of the KKK. Please..... just the good old country boys is right."
3,Dukes of Hazzard tv show dvds set,"The Dukes of Hazzard, The first season dvds were a bit disapointing, when the first disk skipped in some spots.I am glad to report that the other disks were better.So overall it could have been better. But was alright after all they were used.Thanks Gary."
5,I couldn't put it down!,This small volume grabs you from the opening (a minor leaguer's unexpected entry into Beymer) and holds you till the exciting conclusion (I'll never tell!). It is a very warm and human tale set against the backdrop of America's Game in a small town that could be anywhere. I would truthfully recommend this read (and do) even if Marshall were not my younger brother
2,"Ah...It's kinda Okay, sort of...","It ain't the worst game ever, but don't expect a lot from it. It could've been a better game, but maybe they didn't put in enough time when designing it."
4,Underrated PKD,"Pretty slow, but full of utterly believable characters that I really cared about (even though they're pretty messed up people)."
5,Can't beat Ramsey Patriot 9500UT,"We bought this winch for hunting and moving through some of our country's (Trinidad) most rugged terrain. The clutch system is what sets this winch apart from the rest . . . there is no need to go back and forth to the vehicle . . . it's truly a one-man team! The packaging was well organised, there were good graphics and everything well explained and it was easy to install (mounted on a Toyota 4x4). So easy we ran the electronics ourselves. Today we tried it out pulling a Toyota 4x4. We'll update the review with photos after we hit the forest!"
5,Immediate fruits,I did this study with a group of girls and found it just perfect for my teaching style. We were very blessed to see the fruit from these lessons immeditely after the study. Praise God!
1,Must be a cultural thing ....,"This book is really pretty bad. It is so strangely gay that it almost comes off as being homophobic. For example: Matty (the detective) makes a point at the very begining of the book that he has never worn a dress ... yadda, yadda. But, he calls everyone dearie and sweetie and thinks he looks ""scrumptious"" in purple. Next thing you know he is bedding a woman (and suspect). She apparently is a ""fall"" and he has problems with how she dresses ... oh well. There is one section where he meets the father of the jailbait boy hooker he is living with that has to be read to be believed. Throughout it all he puts down other gay men for their age, weight, income, hang-outs .. whatever. Honestly, I don't think I've ever read a book with such an annoying lead character. Try the Nathan Aldyne mysteries instead for a good, humorous look at the gay 80's."
2,Oriole infant uniform,"I was very excited to see the Oriole INFANT uniform, however, it came in a two year old size. The new born is much too small for it. He will have to grow a couple more years. You sent the wrong size. I am very unhappy with that.Joan"
1,this game is the WORST!,"This game is increadbly unrealistic, the graphics are horrible and its a disgrase to the twins AND to gamecube! DO OT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,They need college money,"That's why they put their names down on this low, low game. Save your money and save a panda."
4,THIS GAME IS GONNA BE SWEET!!!,"WOOOOWWWWW!!! I've been looking forward to a MaryKate and Ashley game for years now. This game is gonna be one of the best yet. Don't hold me to this but it may even be game of the year. We well just have to wait and see. The graphics will be unbelieveable on the gamecube(almost lifelike). Xbox and PS2 owners will be jealous of this title(its a gamecube only title you know). No doubt about it, that it will be as much fun as the day you got your license. Everyone better go ahead and pre-order this great game. It will be a sell out."
5,"A wonderfull page turner, my favorite among favorites",She has done it again. My family and I have bought this book as fast as they could set them out on the shelfs. This one was my favorite. I loved how Sean never stopped careing for Tara after everything that went on. I love he books and have read them every free minute I have of the day
2,Lacking in Writing Skill,"Anita Stansfield has stories that pull and tug at you. But her style of writing lacks any depth. She is a passive writer, more often preferring to tell you what happens than taking you deep into the heart of the event. This book follows this pattern to a T. Although this story is a very good one, I would not choose to keep this in my library, which indeed I have not."
3,Like the Goggles,"The goggles are too cute. My dog hates wearing; but, I am being persistent with trying to get him used to them. I like that it protects his eyes from UV sun rays. The lens have scratched easily; but, my dog is blind and that should not bother him."
2,Little Shakey Footstool,"This footstool looks great but once it's put together, the legs are not very stable. I've only used mine 3 times and have had to re attach the legs."
3,Upholstered footstool,Footstool arrived quickly and was well packed. I thought the fabric was of poor quality and immediately recovered it and then put it together. It now looks good in my living room and matches my couch.
5,Sylvia,"They say that a work never truly comes alive unless it is read aloud, and it is certainly true in this case. Hearing Sylvia read aloud captures the amazing artistry and imagery in her poetry. This is definitly a 5 star book, and a welcome addition to the bookcase of any Sylvia Plath fan."
1,Top ten Hall of Shame,"A must not buy. Perfect example of juggling between poor dictating and bad spelling. Combined, it makes it almost impossible to understand what he means or figure out where you misspelled the non working scripts provided by the book.Went halfway through it and knew I couldn't return it because of it's discount.257 pages, binding included. Weights about 300 grams. It's printing process must have been way more exciting then it's content is.0 ou of 10#1 Hall of Shame"
2,Where was the editor?,"If you learn by following examples, this book is not for you. The author's enthusiasm for the topic seems genuine, but his instructions are haphazard. Unless you're two steps ahead of him (which, if you were, you probably wouldn't be interested in buying his book), you're going to have a hard time learning anything. Not surprisingly, there's a disclaimer in the front of the book that reads, ""...the publisher and author...make no representations or warranties with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the contents of this book..."" Definitely not a user-friendly experience."
1,Bad buy,There's not much to say. This book sucks! Many code-errors and bad explanation. I think that the writer of this book searched for popular flash-words and made a book out of these words.There's a whole chapter on 3d... But not one sentense in the chapter is about making 3d. Well.. The author tells you what programs you make 3d with.It's the same with the website to the book. A nice un-updated site!But I'm impressed that such a book actually can be printed.
4,"An interesting, well-informed view","Lawrence Rosen is one of the most thoughtful anthropological voices writing about the Middle East. In ""The Culture of Islam"" he attempts something which is almost impossible: concisely describe and write about a dogmatically and culturally diverse religion with a depth of understanding that permeates how religion is actually lived. I was sympathetic to much of what he wrote, which comes mainly from Arab examples (and even there from an exceptional case, Morocco), although I did not necessarily agree with all of his conclusions. He is well-versed in Islamic jurisprudence and Arab social organization, and this primer goes farther than most in conveying a palpable understanding of a fascinating system of thought, meaning-making and cosmology. Because his experience is mainly in Morocco, as mentioned before many of the examples come from there. That does not detract from his main points which most definitely have resonance across the entire region."
3,2 cup measure,"I was looking to replace my flimsy 2 cup measureing cup as it is useful for large receipies like bread and candy that requires many cups. This will do the job, but is heavy duty, more like a nice small sauce pan. I'd rather have something less bulky but with better construction than the welded ""K-mart"" 2 cup measure that it replaced. Oh well."
5,Faucet Satisfaction,"I wanted to have a water filter installed on my sink for drinking water. When my Plumber came, the only type of faucet he had was chrome. Everything in my kitchen is white and although I didn't want chrome, I agreed to it because he told me he couldn't get it in white. After he left I got to thinking about it and went on-line to see what I could find. Amazon had exactly what I wanted and in white too! I ordered ... they shipped super fast and my Plumber ended up installing the white one I had wanted in the first place. My white faucet is a Plumbest B70-001 Decorative Bar Tap Faucet and it works good, looks great and I am very happy!"
5,Beautiful Book!,"This is a beautifully written, engaging story that will inspire young girls (and boys I'm sure...) to follow their passions, listen to their hearts and take risks in life. It unveils the personal power each of us have to make changes in our lives, despite the odds. It is also a marvelous window into the colorful and rich culture of Bangladesh; giving young readers a chance to explore a culture most will never experience first hand.For the young (and older... I loved the book and I'm 46!) ""armchair traveler"" it's a great trip!"
5,picture does not do it justice,Very beautiful and sparkles well.... Chain could be nicer and it is only about 15 or 16 inch... But the pendant is better than the blurry picture shows...She will love it....
3,"Size runs small, but otherwise very cute!","I normally wear a size 7, and ordered this shoe in size 7 only to find that it was too small. You should probably order 1/2 to 1 size larger than normal with this shoe."
2,Star Wars Yoda Plush By Kenner,"The ""picture"" gives an impression of better quality then the item actually is. For roughly $24 dollars, I don't at all think it was worth it."
5,Yoda Plush,I think it's a great toy .I'm trying to buy it myself but they are always out of this toy.I wish they had it!
4,one of my all favs,"the 2nd of a 7 part series about the eden family. they don't write romances like this anymore. the story sucks you in quickly, and will keep you up at night totally absorbed. a true page turner, both exhilerating and tragic.the characters are so rich and well developed. the sex scenes between heroine and hero are hot but few. oh, and for you ladies who like a handsome hunk on the cover. this is the book for you (paperback only). this guy is so gorgeous, it makes me want to put his picture in my wallet...."
4,Large flat metal tool case for recipricating saw.,"June 2012: This all-metal box was built for a Milwaukee sawzall, but it fits my 6 amp (smallish) Craftsman reciprocation saw just fine. I particularly like that that box is not form-fitted like most plastic cases, but instead is an open box. I store extra blades in the top 1/2 and the tool (sans blade) in the bottom. The case is thin and flat - easy to store. It is sturdy and well made.If the top-bottom metal divider were adjustable, I would have given it 5 stars. As it is you just have to hope it fits your saw.- My skill level: minor house repairs -"
3,"Ok, not great",Container is ok but not particularly secure. I think BD product is better but of course more than twice the price. Also not much of a bargain when you add shipping unless you by large quantity. I bought two and shipping was still almost 4 times the purchase prices. Live and learn.
4,"Great, but....","Received two strips which were exactly as advertised and exact replacement of the original ones on the garage door.The problem was the way they were packed. One arrived on a box exactly the length of the strip, but the other waspackaged on a shorter box which made it necessary to bend it, fortunately Amazon made it good."
4,An Intriguing Compilation,"This anthology of poems comprises many different themes about people's life experiences. These expressions of love, death, estrangement, despair, atonement, hope, etc., provoke a poignant response from the reader. For instance, ""The Soldiers Prayer"" has a realistic perspective of war. Plenty of poems to cry to when the kleenex is handy."
4,Keeps getting better,"Just when you thought that they couldn't possibly make a new Tony Hawk that provided original gameplay, Activision came out with this awesome game. The best addition to this installment has to be the way that they revamped how you achieve objectives. In previous versions, you had to keep retrying the level, suffering through annoying load times just so you can retry the objectives. Now, there is no timelimit on the levels, and you activate objectives by talking to people on the board. Fail the objective? No problem. Hit start and select ""retry objective"" from the menu.Other than that, the graphics have improved, yet again, and the replay value is even higher than it was before. Can life get better? I thought it couldn't, but Activision proved me wrong!"
2,Should have supported xbox LIVE...,...It doesn't support LIVE although it does support the other...third party online play. If you have a PS2 its a good game. The graphics aren't great but the gameplay is good. If you don't plan to play it online...go for it. Seems like a pretty straight forward game. If you liked the other THPS games...you will like this one.
2,"Absolutely, Completely, Positively.........a snoozer","This game was my friend's favorite, and I took his advice and bought it. It was really fun at first, but then I started to not be able to beat the Challenges and I went to the free campaign mode to play, and to make my school how I wanted. But then, the school isn't a school, it's a bunch of land that you make separate buildings for different classes on. Then kids kept leaving becuase of no bathrooms... even though there was one next to them. The cafeteria always had food poisoning. But the worst part of the game, the one that made this game a snoozer, was the fact that it was incredibly unrealistic. I mean, a roller coaster on a school campus? A skate park? A go kart arena? You have way too much money to buy these things and the students don't go to them. And then, there are deluxe buildings, which cost thousands, and people just don't go to them.This game will trick you, so be careful. Don't buy it, is my advice."
4,This time school is fun!,"I got this game yesterday at school. When I started to play it, it was so fun. The fetures are great you don't accutaly get to make the buildings, but the all ready made ones are still neat. You can make a school in the city, the farm lands and even in Hollywood! There are pree made students, but you can also made new students.There are only 2 things I don't loke about this game is some time you get bankrupt if a tornado hits or if your money gets in the negetives. The other thing I don't like is when big storms hit like hurricanes, earth quakes and tornados becaus e they wreck your buildings and make you lose money. But other wise any of that stuff the game is great! I think yo should get this game and all the other tycoon games!"
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,I JUST GOT THIS GAME AND IT SAY IT IS LOADING AND PUT YOU BACK TO DESK TOP... SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT BUY
2,Not the best Tycoon game.,"Its fun making the school and making people like you want but they have attitude problems. They look boppy and act boppy. Their always jumping on tables,blowing bubbles, and picking on other kids. It was a great idea, but the game wasn`t so great. I recommend Zoo Tycoon and Rollercoaster Tycoon."
2,you can't custimize the building,"I got this game from my birthday and at first I thought is was amazing. I always asked a to use it. But after several weeks It became boring. overall it has a good concept and has fair grafics. But building the school is very limited.pros: clear, yet cartoonlike graphicspersonallity of the charecter is vivid and realcool looking classrooms (besides the porable classrooms)cons: all students, teachers, and principals look the sametoo many disasters example: once I had hurriccane after hurricane continualeslyThe students never leave they only will if they are explelled or leave the high school for some other reasonyou can't build the classrooms. you can only place themfields and clasrooms are unreal (the football field goes from the endzone to the 30 yard line to 50. or in the middle of the math classroom is a enlarged calculater."
1,A totally waste of time and not in a fun way,"I bought this game and got it to work pretty bug free on my computer. For the few of you who can't get yours to work, don't bother because it was by far the simplest childish tycoon game I have ever played. This game isn't meant for anyone over the age of 10 so if your looking for a challange then just skip it. The most you can do with the game is build buildings and arrange them and that gets old after about 20mins. Don't buy this game its a waste and if I could get my money back I would.On the flip side, if you're buying this for a child then go for it. If you have a semi-new computer then you should have any problems running it. I would, however, recommend something more educational for a child. This is good family fun but you don't learn much."
2,Do not waste your time or money...,"Good concept, boring game play. Perhaps this game would be fun for a younger/less experienced Tycoon/Sim player, but if have played better games (The Sims, Zoo Tycoon, even Tropico), then you will be thoroughly disappointed. You cannot interact with the students and/or faculty. You basically place the buildings, spend money, and that's it. Definitely not too interesting and limited game options."
3,okay,the idea is great School Tycoon its awesome. But for some reason it installed great but once i got it going it froze up my computer and i never go to play it.
1,Didn't Work,"I just got this game about 3 days ago and I was really excited to play it. But everytime i try to play the game it will open and it will say that its loading, but then after about 5 minutes of loading it will exit out of the game."
4,THE GREAT DEBATE,"THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! MY FRIEND AND I ARE SITTING IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER DUH, PLAYING THIS AWESOME GAME. I WILL GIVE THIS GAME FIVE STARS. IT IS THE BEST."
3,The Game Isn't Half Bad!,"A Couple Years Ago, I Bought This Game At My School's Book Fair. I Came Home, Popped The Game Disk In, And The Fun Began!Graphics - 9.0Sound - 7.0Loading Time - 4.0Overall - 7.0"
3,Read me,"The premise for the game wasnt bad, the graphics could have been better. THE THING I HATED THE MOST; DISASTERS!!!! Once you got ahead of the game, got some cash and students, BOOM! earthquake or tornado. Who thought that up? You CANT turn them off either, i tried looking for cheat codes. Its a lame game, its not a good (im bored, need a good tycoon game to pass the time)so think before you buy, if its for a child, they'll get bored with it or pissed off."
4,room for improvement,"I have played the game many times and think overall it is good such as;the hiring and firingthe buildings are amazing, my school doesn't have an arcade :(, wish we had.I like the freak weatherI liked the detention rooms, dramatic or wat!room for improvement;the school days aren't long enough i don't thinkwhen you get a bankrupcy warning you don't get enough time and i think you should be able to get a loan and pay it back weeklynot enough choice of features for methe newspaper release is the same all the time and it get abit boring when you have made the school because once you have got everything there is nothing else to doThe game is good thoughBUY IT YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!"
2,actually worked,"This game actually worked on my computer when i tried it i have to say, and ive been saying for many a year (dont i sound old!) that someone should make a school tycoon game. This one however - whilst it may be the first one at least i know of to do it is - as you can see - riddled with bugs, for me it was mostly whenever a building began to smoke from not being fixed it would crahs the game. Apart from this the gameplay was farely average, but didnt ever really get past the simple 'build this, then build this and you can build this'. So it got boring really quickly. Overall only 2 start, and i wouldnt recomend it - although at least i can actually say it worked which seems to be more than the others here!"
5,Cute and distracting,"Had this game before, but lost it. I odered it somewhat new, but it was brand new. Arrived on time bright and early. No compaints at all."
2,Not worth the price,"Cute idea for a game, but...where is the sandbox mode? The game has tornado's that come thru the town and destroy what you may have built, students leave and you run out of money. Game Over. The game should have a better sandbox mode (unlimited cash)."
4,When you absolutely positively have to carry it.,"I've got 2 of these. Once I was drywalling a basement and the supply house guys couldn't get their cart down to the room we needed it in. We got a couple of these babies and went to work. We carried down about 4000 sq ft of drywall with these in 4 hours. Tough way to get the rock where it's needed, but sometimes that's your only choice. Two guys can move drywall sheets up to 12 feet in length. Longer panels would be extremely awkward."
4,Works as advertised,"Moved a sheet of 1/2"" 4'x8' down steps to my basement with ease. Today my brother and I moved 47 sheets down the steps! 34 (17 doubles) of 1/2"" 4'x8'. The handle is rough on the hands as some others have stated on here. We both put a glove on halfway through and it seemed to help some. When we got to the single 1/2"" 4'x12' sheets we were both happy again! (alot less weight than those 8' doubles) lol. We are both in construction so our hands are not ""weak"" or soft haha. But it seemed that with more weight it really digs in. Definitely worth the $$$ and waaaaay better than a pinch grip or shoulder carry. Wear a glove from the start!"
5,Well worth it!,"I was skeptical of this item until I used to haul 4'x8' sheets of 7/16""OSB from a trailer to a garage under construction. It saved my back & arms from a lot of wear & tear. Really like this tool a lot!!!!!"
3,"Does what it promises, but not very helpful","I purchased two of these knowing that we were going to be moving several hundred sheets of drywall around our new home. They do funtion as promised and allow the weight of the sheet to be shifted downward. However, they make it harder to maneuver around doorways and hallways where you need to switch the side you are holding.They would be helpful if you are moving a stack of sheets from one location to another that is not obstructed."
5,Art very happy,This is really an excellent item. It does work as expected and hope for. I also recieved this item timely.
4,Couldn't have done it without this...,"I had to carry three sheets of 5/8"" particle board by myself for a project that I'm doing. I couldn't have carried it without this handle. While it was still very heavy to move, at least I could move it.The reason that I didn't give five stars is because it's difficult to get the piece up onto the handle. I found that I could lean the handle against my leg, lift the edge of the piece to get the handle under it, then kind of slide the handle to the middle. If the handle was designed to stand up on its own, it would have certainly gotten five stars from me."
4,Exactly what I needed,Moved 32 sheets of 4x8 drywall. This made the job that much easier. Only complaint is that the grip could be a little larger to make it easier to hold onto. Other than that highly recommended.
3,Too short,Picture is very misleading - looks way bigger than it is.I'm short and this is too short - have to bend awkwardly both directions to carry even just one panel. A dolly is much better even just a single one. May just make one.
3,i got the hook up,the cd is ok it is not the best the song igot the hook up is one of the best all no limet is good go bey this cd
2,This aint good,"i listened to dis cd and it aint even good. This cd only has like 4 good songs, da one by skull duggery is sick. if u can find that song then get it and forget the rest of the cd"
5,Ice Cube and Jay Z made it tight. What about Puffy and DMX?,"Bone, Cube, Jay Z and Mack 10 were the bomb. East and West coast flava is together at last. Next time No limit relases a soundtrack, please ask enimem if he would like to be in it? He's a tight white rapper."
1,DONT GET THIS GAME,"This is by far the worst game i have ever played or will probably ever play. i am miserable that i got it and i cant return it because i lost the pamphlet. I would rather not have it than have it at all it is so boring. if you want it, email me and i will give it to you for free. Please take it away from me!!!"
1,LAME!!,"as a female gamer i understand the need for ""girl games"" etc. but these olsen games (the horse game, the shopping game, and now this) are all really boring and super easy. just because there are girls that want to play games doesn't mean they need to be dumbed down. i suggest you get something else."
4,It is ok i guess!,"I did not like it a lot but it was cool how it was party style.But it was easy to win,too easy.I guess it is better for younger kids and mary-kate and ashley fans."
5,"Quite, efficient and well-priced","This is my first ever food processor and I love it. I bought this particular model because it's a Consumer Reports ""Best Buy"" for quality and price. I love to cook and can't believe how having a food processor has simplified food preparation, from slicing as well as chopping fruits and vegetables to mixing together various cheeses for pimento cheese spread. This processor is extremely quite, nearly inaudible, and the size is perfect. The only thing I would change is I wish the slicer gave me some options. There are times I would prefer thicker slices than I get with the one option. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this processor."
5,Chicken Noodle Soup,My family has always liked this soup - the kids can make it easily in the microwave for a fast snack.
1,Mis-marked in catalog & on package,"The National Mfg. 142067 hinge is described in the catalog and on its packaging as a removable pin hinge. It's not. Someone screwed up. It's a fixed pin. I bought and returned three pairs of them. I destroyed one trying to remove the pin. At the hardware store the owner destroyed another one. I phoned Stanley (they own National) and they read me the catalog description. It's wrong. Now one person there knows and he's not in position to do anything about it. If you meet a Stanley jobber, tell him. If enough people know, it might eventually get fixed."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","This book is ok for looking up words in english and finding the iraqi pronounciation. It is useless for looking up words in arabic and finding the english (unless you want to learn a whole new transliteration language.) Know this, there is NO ARABIC SCRIPT in this book. You are expected to learn a transliteraiton system that is as difficult as just spending two weeks and learning arabic script. Really dumb guys. Next time, include the arabic. This book isn't terribly useful."
2,Arabic script please!,"When using this dictionary to assist me in translating some Iraqi Arabic to English I found it harder to use because it is romanized, than if they had used the Arabic script. Transliterating what I was reading into latin script so I could try and use words in this dictionary made things more difficult, rather than easier. I don't recommend it."
3,It was fun for 20 minutes,"This interactive DVD game was fun for about 20 minutes and then it was annoying. The questions were not creative or challenging. I expected it to work as an icebreaker/party game for a group of college students, but it's just not much fun."
2,very odd game,"we played it a few times and put it up, it's kinda pointless and not much fun at all, a very odd game, I was really expecting more from Howie!"
2,Disappointing,"The product had appeal to be ideal for party situations. Unfortunately it did not live up to it. The questions were not as creative nor challenging as expected although it was very easy to use. In addition, the software became confused as to the number of players and the final results tabulated were questionable"
5,on time,"We didn't actually play with this game since we bought it as a gift; however, it arrived on time and in great condition."
3,3.5,"This FPS is not as good as the original in terms of storymode. The graphics are better with the GO MOD tech engine that has great damage system when shooting rockets against walls and so on. The enemy AI is average with them taking cover from your gunshots. This is basic gameplay by just shooting anything that moves and you can't drive vehicles, you can only shoot out of them or ""riding shotgun"".Multiplayer is fun but not as good as TimeSplitters 2. If you've got many FPS or action games with shooting get something new like RPG or sports or anything else because this offers nothing new except for the great damage engine."
3,Just not as good as the first,"Pros:Beter graphicsMore gunsa lot of multiplayer modes4 player multiplayercan hold 2 weaponsCons:The sounds are not as good as the first onethe game is very short(First one was pretty long)The game doesn't have as much dept as the first oneWith the recovoring health, it looks like as if it's trying to copy Halo, and the game is pretty dang boring. The first one just made you wanna kill someone, this one really didn't hae much of that in it. The multiplayer is the thing that saves this game(If you have 4 friends a multitap, and 4 controllers, it'll be one heck of a blast). But the game doesnt' have the dept as the first red faction, the fact that the weapon aiming sux really takes a lot of dept out of the game. If you're looking for a good follow-up, you won't et much, unless you're looking for good multiplayer game.peace"
2,"Alright THQ, let's get real.","What were they thinking? It has little next to nothing to do with the Red Faction, which what was the original was all about. There is no real POINT to the game. and with all the twists and turns, you don't know if you're the good guy or the bad.And if all this isn't bad enough, they make it short. you can beat it in a two day time span. This is not worth [$$] I can assure you that much.While the game is somewhat fun, it is basically a different game. It only slightly mentions Red Faction a couple of times. You see a character or two of the Red Faction, and that's about it.The game doesn't take place on Mars either. That was half the thrill of the other one. You don't really know what your going to run into in mines that are underground in Mars.The geo-mod in this game is okay, but there is a lot of mesh wiring under most surfaces, making it impossible to pass through.Rent this before you consider buying it. It will save you a heart attack wallet wise."
3,Okay Game If You're Bored,"This is my first First Person Shooting game for PS2 and I must say it's just an alright game. Nothing spectacular. The Geo Mode thing that is supposed to allow you to blow up random stuffs to find some other items or determine where you go in the game doesn't make any difference to me.One thing that I hate about this game is the night vision goggle mode. You basically have to wear the damn thing in 50% of the time. I don't know if that's because the programmers are too lazy to brighten up the backgrounds or what, but when I can't see jack for doodoo it kinda peeves me off.Some people say this game is too short, but I'm struggling to finish it. Not because it's a tough game, but because I'm tired of it. Not a challenging game for a first timer."
1,"Disappointing, at the least","I was, as well, a big fun of red faction.I agree with most of the other reviews... the game just plain.... What i do not understand is that everyone seems to appreciate the graphics - I though graphics on red faction 1 were much better. Not to talk about the dialogs, some very poor attempts to introduce humor in the game - annoying from the very first time you hear them, not to talk about having to listen to them over and over. The screams of dyig soldiers resemble more a parody - i can see the guys cracking up while recording those."
4,RF2 Da Sequel,"Here's a simple mixture: Take awesome graphics,amazing sound,hi-tech weaponry, and vehicles and mix it. Season it up with easy-controll,normal difficulty,a huge array of weapons and then bake it in a PS2. What do ya get a really great 1st person shooter game. RF2 starts out easy and slow for the begginer but also starts out with heavy fire power and explosions. The game gets harder and more exiting each time you pass a level. Toward the end it gets really hard especially the last level which it took me weeks to finally beat it. The game also includes tight multi-player games including capture-the-flag, bagger, and the usual last one standing wins. What [is unacceptable] about this game is in some levels you find enemies all around you making the level harder than it is, lots of re-loading, and lots of throwing your controller across the room in frusratation. Overall its a good game but requires patients."
4,Good Fun...,"I bought a PS2 a week ago, and got Red Faction II as a free game included with the system.Red Faction II is really fun most of the times. The detail is extremely real, and the gameplay was excellent.However, the game is really confusing. There are more plot twists than a pretzel, and half the time, you have no idea what is going on except that you should shoot down the cyborgs.Splattering the blood out of innocent bystanders in a game is fun, and this has plenty. But if you're like me, stick to GTA 3 and GTA Vice City.Red Faction II is fun..."
3,To SHORT BUT SWEET,I thought this was a really good game BUT this game is way to short and if this game was 3/4 longer then it really is i would of bought it but i just rented it and i beat in two days it is really fun while it lasts. Also this game is nothing like the first one and the geo mode [stinks] in this game. If you ask me this game is only worth the rent.
4,Anyone know the opening title monologue by Sopot?,"I thought this was an enjoyable game. The revolution atmosphere and the worker's war against tyranny and hyper capitalism really gave the game a feel of it's own. I wasn't too sure about the legions of undead, but at least you don't feel quite as guilty when you decapitate them with your chosen firearm.But what I really wanted someone to help me out with is by writing the opening monologue by Sopot in this review section. During the opening credits, the ruthless dictator Sopot has a speech where he harangues the Red Faction and works the crowd up with a frenzy of rage and propaganda. The speech begins: ""The world has abandoned us. We fight alone, against an insidious enemy...""After that I don't remember. I rented the game and thought the speech was really good. Maybe I should contact the game designers instead. They would probably have that text somewhere. Forget it."
5,Worth the wait,"Still one of the best first person games and they have improved a lot of the graphics, movement, etc."
3,Original was better,"Red Faction 2 didn't seem to be as good as the original. There wasn't an auto-aim option so it's hard to hit your enemies, and the levels seem a lot less interesting compared to the original."
3,I liked the original better!,"Red Faction 2 is an OK game it lacks what Red Faction mastered. In the first Red Faction you felt like you were there, because in the first you were alone. In the first, you got scared when you would hear someones footsteps and turn around and splatter the wall with a shot gun and their head. Now its: hurry up, shoot 15 machine gunners with 2 pistols! now take out that other guy. Red Faction was more played out and let you ambush one enemy at a time. Now your on a gory rollercoaster ride. When your done you dont have that feeling of accomplishment as you did with the first. In the first you hide the body of a guy so you can take out his friends. Thats realistic. One man normally cant defeat 100 enemies by spraying bullets. RED FACTION WAS MORE STRATEGIC! GO BUY IT FOR 20 DOLLARS INSTEAD OF WASTING YOUR MONEY ON A BORING GAMERED FACTION 1 score: 5 out of 5Get it from your local bargain bin"
1,Laurence Oliver's Production of Henry V,"Did not receive this product or any word from the seller as to why it was not sent. I ordered this DVD to give as a Christmas present on 12-7-08 and as of 1-7-09 I had not received my order. As a result, I filed a request for reimbursement of the cost of this purchase. This transaction was certainly not up to the usually great experience I've had with ordering from Amazon.com :("
4,Worth sharing!,"Hooked from the first page, I nearly read this in one sitting. For me, that's the litmus test for a good book and this one definitely passed! (In fact, I recently bought a novel by a mega-author who shall remain nameless and I struggled over two weeks to finish it.)Eller has taken a familiar story, that of the Prodigal Son, and crafted a compelling, contemporary tale with believable characters and, just as important, without condescending preachiness. I will donate my copy to my daughter's school and recommend it to our church's library. It's the ideal book, particularly for young people (high schoolers and older) who doubt the reality of a personal God and His relentless, unconditional love."
4,Great video for counselors who work with families and children.,"Although the video was obviously shot more than a decade ago (it won the APA National Media Award in 1986), Greenspan's work in the area of social/emotional development of children is very relevant. This video is wonderful for those studying or teaching child development and counselors working with parents and children. The only down side in my opinion is that it ""looks"" dated, but the information itself is ""5 star""."
3,Not very good.,"I am not going to rehash the synopsis, but I will only share my feelings. I was so excited to read this book. My library system does not have it in circulation, so I ended up purchasing it from here. I was extrememly underwhelmed by the story. I read many IR tales, but this is by far in the top 5 heavy-handed. At some point, it is nice to think you're just reading a story. Never the case with this book. I should have expected though after reading the author's acknowledgments. I didn't find a lot of depth in the story and most of it could be predicted."
4,Extremely well written,"I'm glad that I purchased this book. The story was very well written and the author obviously has in-depth knowledge of interracial and familial relationships.It was a relaxing, yet engaging read."
2,"OK Story IDEA, Fair Writing","Although the author's story idea is good, his attempt at writing was fair. For example, when Destiny and Tony shared their first kiss, the author never really stated that they kissed or even wrote about the reaction of the characters during the kiss. What he wrote was of Tony leaning in, and then, the next paragraph was of her telling her cousin about the kiss. I had to re-read the previous paragraphs to see if i had missed something.I would not recommend this book to anyone. There were too many twists and turns that were improbable. I would say to the author that he should not quit his day job."
1,Would have been useful 15 years ago.,"Though printed relatively recently, this book reads as though it's 15 years old at least. Gosh, we have hypertext now! And chat rooms! Isn't it amazing? This is seriously all this book has to offer. Steer clear of it."
2,Phooey!,"My kids were bored to death during this movie. The scenery was pretty and the horses were beautiful to watch but...First off, the girl playing the star sounded like she was from New Jersey, not Arabia. Then, we couldn't follow the storyline very well--it just didn't make sense. So, I would not rate this movie very highly at all. It might be palatable to a 5-year-old."
2,"Too short to be a ""movie""","I had made the mistake of paying for an overpriced ticket to see this movie when it was in IMAX theatres. I thought that the ""movie"" was too short then and I continue to hold my opinion. The film comes across as a low-budget made-for-tv movie due to its shortness in length and unremarkable plot. I would have liked to see a variety in the scenery and an increase in the action or acted emotions from the actors. Disney has a great idea of making a horse movie with a female lead but this script wasn't quite it. I'd wait until the price drops to around $8 before purchasing this film."
3,"A treat for young viewers, and a visual feast","Young viewers will appreciate the easy friendship between the beautiful colt and the girl. It is a visual feast throughout and splendid horses adorn the feature, along with thrilling race segments. The action is a little long in coming and the movie is somewhat short though.The girl assumes a skilled role in training her friend, and she wins the race. It is predictable, certainly, but girl viewers can identify with the hero, who is finally not a boy, and who, more importantly, gains respect from grown men for her efforts."
1,Disappointed,"Although the scenery is nice, I am sorely disappointed in both acting and content. It was as tho' I was watching a middle school production with forced acting. Also, the story has little build up in anticipation of it climax. You just get started watching and the movie is over. Literally. I do not recommend this movie.I have read most of Walter Farley's books, this movie does not do his stories justice."
1,PLEASE READ THE BOOK!,"I'm all for movies that are based on books, I feel it encourages more people to read. Yes, there are those who don't even know there is a BOOK (*gasp*) but hey, I'm used to less than observant people. I'm also one that understands that the movies will frequently be a little different from the books because of time constraints. But, this is INSANE. Fifty minutes isn't a time constraint, it's a death wish. And where does the book show up in this? There's a black horse in both, wow. >_< There may be more than that, but I couldn't finish watching, sorry."
5,EXCELLENT,"Paid $$$$ and travelled two hours one way to see this when it came out at IMAX - can't praise it enough for content, scenery and characters - just one of those family/horselover movies that takeover your heart!"
5,A Classic,"I am a big time horse lover and a fan of Walter Farely's Black Stallion series of books. I also loved the movie The Black Stallion as a child. I used to beg and bed my mom for horse just like The Black. Of course she said that we already had enough horses... but I would reply ""But we don't have The Black"". And what child who read the books and watched the movie didn't want their own Black Stallion? Who didn't want to be in young Alex's place, riding that great horse?Anyhow on to The Young Black StallionIt came out on DVD today and I had to rent it. And it is a great movie, ever bit as good at the first The Black Stallion. I can not find anything that I didn't like about the movie. I especially loved the bonus feature at the begining with Gina and The Black's Sire.I have to say, that unless you are a avid horse lover and a fan of artistic type of movies, this is not the movie for you. But if you loved The Black Stallion you will love this one."
4,bealls,"Bealls is a good place to find this product, as it has been discontinued. I made an error and order wrong product, plus it didn't fit. Not Bealls fault and I was able to return for credit."
5,Nine Ducks Nine,"This is a wonderfully illustrated book about ducks. It is not as simplistic as that, though. Counting with a repetitious rhyme is the clencher that keeps kids reading. Their interest is maintained by the cute ducks that are constantly harassed by a fox. The story line is ingenious. I recommend all children be exposed to this book. It lends itself to numerous activities that will keep their imagination flowing."
3,"Good Music, Not Great Sound Quality","While Nat King Cole never sounds bad as a singer, this collection of his music is of poor recording quality. The last two songs of Disc 2 (especially Gee Baby, Ain't I Good To You) are horribly crackled, making it difficult to stand listening to Cole's beautiful voice. The rest of the songs sound like original recordings that were digitally copied from LPs using an LP USB record converter--in other words, a homemade creation. The songs are great, but I'd recommend another collection if you're a serious oldies/crooners music listener."
2,LAME!!! Enough With Wrestling Titles,All that I really have to say is are there not enough wrestling titles??? I mean seriously there have to be at least 20 wrestling games from the past 5 years. Sick.... No seriously I think I might throw up. :( Hasn't WWF made enough money on all of their sell-out items yet?
1,PMP Cd product purchase,"This product has no Key, and the owner has refused to contact me to resolve the problem. In fact, i am seeing it as a frud between Amazon and the Seller. In addition, how can i rate a product that is not useable?Richmond"
1,Not Recommended,"The PMP Exam practice test questions on this CD are ridiculous. Almost every question has grammatical errors and the question language is very basic, nothing like the questions I have seen on several other practice exams where the questions are much more sophisticated. There are not only many, many grammatical errors, but the PMI terms are often referred to incorrectly. The basic terms are there, but something is not quite right. This test seems to have been put together by someone that does speak English as their first language or maybe it has been translated from another language and something has been lost in the translation. I definitely do not recommend this CD for practice for the PMP exam."
3,Learning Computers,I thought it was a later version. It is adequate but I've worked with the two versions after it and like them a lot better.
1,Didn't notice that it contained Splenda,I bought this b/c it was supposed to be all natural. I didn't see that it contained Splenda. It was disgustingly sweet. If you're into artificial sweeteners then this product might be alright.
3,Entertaining But Not Renault's Best,"My first suprise with this book was that it was Set in England in the thirties - I had only read Renault's novels set in ancient times and loved them and just picked this up b/c she wrote it. As it turns out this was her first novel - written in the 30s and given that-it is very good. She tells the story of Vivian and Mic both working in the rigid hospital life of that era - but living a life outside the hospital that was a lot more passionate. Abortion, unfaithfulness,emotional angst and sexual themes in the book kept me reading and I would probably read it again. The grim and dark feeling that the book left me with is probably what is influencing my lower rating."
2,Hoaky and inaccurate,"The main tension of this film, Porter's devotion to his career vs. his wife's longings for his attentions, is sad and pathetic, all the more so because the movie's conclusion seems to be some kind of romantic reunion between the two. Is it celebrating it, or does Grant's tortured look over Linda's shoulder betray darker, more forboding elements in their relationship. Be that as it may, they never really delve into Porter's life in any gripping, realistic way. You can hear the music better performed many, many places. It's fun to watch Wooley and Martins' performances, as well as the cameos by the likes of Eve Arden. Not a keeper, but worth seeing once if your a fan of any of the performers in the film or whom the film is about."
2,Not lovely,"If you're looking for a movie that accurately tells the story of Cole Porter, this is clearly not it. Nor is it a great movie in any way. The story telling is cheesy and quite amateurish -- a surprise for a movie starred by Cary Grant. Still Grant's sheer charisma, and Porter's extraordinary music, make this a movie somewhat worth watching."
3,"Compare and contrast to ""De-Lovely""","""De-Lovely"", of course, is the 2004 biofilm of Cole Porter, which explores subjects - especially Porter's gayness - that ""Night and Day"" couldn't. That being stipulated, though, I thought Cary Grant did quite well as Porter, though the movie, again, isn't really able to explore the complexities of Porter's relationship with his wife Linda, going for a more conventional route of ""wife neglected by success-driven star"". The music is terrific either way, though."
2,"Oye, what a loser!","I love Cary Grant. He is a phenomenon. But this movie missed the mark on so many levels. First of all, Cary looked stiff and he seemed to be NOT enjoying himself at all throughout the entire movie. Cole Porter was a bi-sexual. I know that was taboo when this pic was made, but not even one little hint? All I will say is that the music was great. But that is all that is great about this movie."
3,NIGHT AND DAY reviewed,"Cary Grant and Alexis Smith star in this movie about the life of Cole Porter. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the biography, but it does include many of Cole' best-known songs."
3,too short has lost it should have stayed retired,"too short regardless of what he started back in the day is dead musically that is and he should really just stop rapping since nobody is feeling him no more anyway and it hurts to see imposters like jay z, 50 cent, an everybody else talking this pimp nonsense and forget about old short dog."
4,AWESOME!,"U cant shoot people and dont review a hunting game if u r against hunting. This game is so awesome there are so many rifles and accessories to choose from, then u can go to the target range and test out ur weapon. Carreer mod is fun because u can pick from lots of ages of chars, each has its strs and weaknesses. I only wish stand hunting was a little easier because the animals never come. I wish that u could be more stealthy. And I wish that u could hunt in more places than just North America. If u like hunting this is an awesome game to rent or buy!"
1,Sping the extra $10 and buy Deer Hunter,"Bad controls, bad driving, bad graphics, and bad loading. Don't waste your money. Deer Hunter goes right where this game failed."
4,In Response To Most Other Reviewers......,Come on! You think killing innocent deer for sport is fun? It's cruel. This game is sickening. What did the deer ever do to you?
4,Great + realistic Hunters' game,"Cabelas' ""Big Game Hunter"" is a great hunting game even for only moderately fans of tha genre (Hunting, of course). It is a great hunting game and if tha controls were better than it would've gotten 5 *'s."
3,Nice introduction,"I wouldn't really call this publication a book and CD. It definitely includes a CD--with 10 of the most famous of Mozart's works, or rather, sections thereof.But the ""book"" is only a 24-page CD insert, glued to Cd's the back cover, and providing the kind of introduction to Mozart, his life and times that might be suitable for a middle or high school student, heretofore devoid of classical music studies. It has 8 sections, including one called ""test your knowledge"" and another entitled ""further interest.""The recordings--what there are of them--are very high quality. But if you're a serious Mozart lover, this is not for you. It's best to introduce kids to music--or as music for the car, when there are no classical radio stations in range."
5,Good product but...,"I have used LaCie drives before in the past and I have been impressed. Unfortunetly this product does not properly fit inside of an Apple G5. When I try to eject the drive, it gets stuck unless I manually force it out. There is no problem with the drive itself, its simply a flaw in the design of G5, I would however recommend it for a Windows/Linux based PC."
1,Hose for dryer,"The hose took almost an extra week to get here, the hose it's self is very flimsy . It was supposed to come with clamps to attach it to the dryer and they never arrived at all.... My opinion is that it was not worth the time to order it."
3,"not what I was after; although I'm sure if you like this kind of music, then it's probably what you want.","Slow Down! I was in a hurry and ordered this when I actually wanted the sound track to the movie ""PS I Love You."" These are definately not the same CD!"
2,Disappointed,There were many songs not on this soundtrack that I desperately wanted. I think that is because it is just a one man soundtrack but I missed Galway Girl and Fairytale of New York. These were talked about by most after seeing the movie and I am sorely disappointed to not see them on the soundtrack.The songs on the soundtrack are good don't get me wrong.
3,Vague,"To be completely honest, I LOVED How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, but this one will just sit on my shelf. The main message of the book (which TOTALLY reminded me of a poem book- full of wisdom, I'm sure, but difficult to apply) was to repeat moments in your life that brighten it up. I say vague, because Lakein's not presumptous enough to say what will bring YOU joy, but leaves that respectfull distance. It left me with the impression that I need to get outside around sunset times more. Anyway, I guess I was just expecting suggestions on what to do while waiting for an appointment, etc."
2,Some good and some very bad information.,"This book is good as a very basic introduction to Box Turtles and Tortoises. The pictures are good and some of the advice on certain species is worth while.However, there is some very bad information included. As anexample, increasing the humidity for a Star Tortoise. This advice will secure large vet bills for you from the respiratory issues your Star will certainly develop. Another is keepng your tortoise in a glass aquarium or glass sided enclosure.I doubt the auther has any real-life experience with many of the tortoise species he mentions in this book. If he did, most will be quite ill or no longer with us."
1,this does not cover Box Turtles,this does not cover Box Turtles at all Just wasted my money on this book I was able to find on the web more
1,Went up in smoke in 2 weeks,Only used it once a day to make vegetable smoothies. No ice involved.After a couple of weeks the blender lost most of it's power and started smokingVery disappointed in this piece of junkWill not buy Oster again. Ever.
2,Not the same blender,"I purchased this model from Amazon a couple of years ago, and I loved it. My jar was dropped and I didn't know I could just get a jar, so I dumped the whole thing to buy another. Mistake. This is the same model, and even Amazon tells me that I purchased this blender before, but it's not the same. It is not as heavy, more cheaply made, and it is also noisier by a LOT and it smells, at least at the first use. I am seriously considering returning it, but that's so much trouble and expense. I may be stuck. I am suspicious of Oster after this. Maybe this is a fake Oster since it's now sold by a 3rd party??? Not the same; that's all I know for sure. :) The glass jar has different markings, the lid is different, the blender is noisier, smells when operating, is lighter weight, and the buttons are a different color."
2,Its not a good blender,"I should have listened to the earlier reviews , this blender leaves chunks of ice and doesn't blend well. No wonder its cheap. Returned it."
2,A little disapointed,I have a big problem to make puree for my baby.It does not do the job.Also the botton is made of plastic.It looks cheap.
4,picked for a wedding gift,Don't know if they like but I assume it wouldn't have been on their registry if not
2,Judy,"This blender is very flimsy, I honestly don't expect it to last very long. It will blend a smoothy OK, but the buttons are wobbly and the top and bottom or very thin. I'm disappointed. I'm going to have to return this one and order some thing else."
1,Are you kidding me??????,"I kept going over reviews on different blenders in the $30-$50 price range and this one seemed to have the best reviews. In a nutshell... it was delivered at 5:30, I tried it, got a return authorization and 5:45 and it's going back to tomorrow!!! I was blending a concoction of honey and a few other ingredients... nothing solid, just wanted to blend this a little more and within seconds the whole unit started smoking. That's it, next!"
3,It's 5 o'clock somewhere!,"Bought as gift for someone I know. She does a lot of research on things before she decides which one she likes best, and this is the one she wanted. The only thing that would have made this one better is if it had a pour spout for frozen drinks and such. The price was a little high(41+shipping):^(, do your diligence, there are some of the same out there for less. I just hope it lasts for her, and if it doesn't I'll keep everyone informed. Anyhow margarita time."
2,Plastic lid plug got blended!,"The little plastic ""plug"" in the lid fell through into the blender as I was using it to make my smoothie... and got ground up. If it happened to me, I'm sure others have experienced the same. Cheap design in my opinion."
3,Haven't used base yet,"I have an older Oster 10 speed that looks like this one but it runs much quieter. I bought this one because the plastic blender jar was cracking pretty bad on my old one. So now I use the glass jar on my old base and it works fine. Also, you may wish to look closely at the buttons on this black model - they are very green!"
4,"Basic Blender, no issues","For the price (and I don't say that to indicate that this is a shotty appliance) this is a great buy. If you want something more hardcore, you obviously need to spend more money. I bought this for my office because I have to make protein shakes for my boss twice a day. It's really easy to use and is pretty good at chopping ice and mixing powders. Buy it if you just want a basic blender that does what a blender should do. (p.s. a little noisy, but it's a BLENDER.)"
5,Good Quality,"This blender is very easy to operate. I mainly use it for making smoothies and mixed drinks. It works great, even on ice cubes and frozen fruit. It is loud, but not more than I was expecting. Clean up is also a breeze."
1,Strange base design,The Osters have a good motor but the one I received had a jar that did not sit comfortably on base. Seems like a design fault as there were 2 tiny blobs of plastic on base in the way!! Returned for refund. The old Osters used to sit tightly on base.
2,Spills all the time,"This is really flimsy and poorly designed. The part holding the blades gets loose too easily, i.e. while mounting the holder on top of the motor, while removing it, even while just sitting on the countertop. The result is nasty spills. Also, there is a burning plastic smell each time it's used. We still use this seldomly (with great care and trepidation) when my wife craves smoothies, hence 2 stars."
4,oster blender - decent,we ended up with this blender after a lot of research. very much apt for indian pickles/chutneys and cuisines. Do not use much for ice crushing though...recommending for indian families who search here for a mixie (blender here.. :) )
4,Excellent for the price,"It's got plenty of power, allowing me to make delicious, refreshing, and healthy smoothies. It crushes ice and frozen strawberries easily and quickly. I got it for $35 from Amazon, so the quality/price ratio is very good.That said, there are some drawbacks. The main one is that the lid is a bit leaky, so occasionally water or juice will squirt out. It's also very loud. And the cord is shorter than I would like it to be (about 2')."
5,Spin Baby Spin,"I just got theOster 6684 12-Speed Blender, Blacktoday along with the Oster Milkshake Blade Blender Accessory 6670 and as with any new kitchen toy have tried it out on a number of things. I throughly enjoy theOster 6684 12-Speed Blender, Blackand think we are going to have a long happy, culinary relationship together."
1,are you kidding me,"my three month old OSTER 6684 blunder, leaks. Every time I use it, it smells like burning plastic. The bottom plastic, screw on base, is not designed properly. When the base motor spins, it burns the plastic ring. After three months, the ring is worn down enough that the blender now leaks. Since it is over 30 days since I purchased from Amazon, I have contacted Oster, for a replacement. But, So far, not a word from them. Just another company, using their Name and, good reputation, to sell cheap merchandise.No idea why my updates are disappearing, but I have received a new blender today, what a difference a blender, that is not defective makes. I change my rating to 4 stars ****"
4,Good replacement,"I destroyed the sister to this replacement making margaritas, tough work, but somebody's got to do it. I am very pleased with this blender and shall resume manufacturing margaritas any day now. Thanks to Amazon my discount for the use of my credit card with them made the cost of this device almost nothing. Can't beat that eh? Carry on shoppers...out."
4,Oster blender,"This blender does the job I want it to do, but my only complaint is that it's very noisy. It's sturdy and should last a long time, though."
5,The perfect practice amp - cheaper then it should be,"I usually do not write reviews, but I love this amp.It sounds great and gets a loud enough to have some fun with.Nice bottom end, nice tone, and fun to play through.It is far better then the Frontman 10 and 15 ( which are basically toys compared to this)It is almost loud enough to have band practice with it (I have not tried it, but I use my Deluxe for that)I have recorded with it - and even use it for practice in a big band (guitar does not need much volume for a big band)It is well built, solid, yet light to carry.It has inputs for an ipod to practice with.It has a real spring reverb! Sounds great.Nice warm 'Fender' Tone (sounds almost tube)The 2 channels with very different soundIt looks cool.I have tried many of these small amps at the guitar center and this sounded the best - and was one of the cheapest too.This is not a toy amp - it is something you can get many years of use out of from beginner to pro"
4,Good solid Purchase,Delivery was prompt. Product is good quality with great solid sound. Fantastic practice amp or performance amp in quiet setting. No bells and whistles but the audio in is great for tailgating also.
5,All expectations met,"From delivery to setup, everything was great. But the real value to me came when the sounds started rolling out. This was the closest amp of solid state design that I found to match my Super twin for the clarity and richness of the sound."
5,Great amp,"This is a really good amp. For the price, it's got a lot of bang for the buck. Great sound and very easy to use."
4,Nice amp,"Chose the Frontman 25R based on both a musician friend's advice and the amazon reviews. This amp looks nice, feels substantial and lets you hook up your iPod and stereo headphones easily with the appropriate adapters if needed. This amp can be loud enough for you to find out just what your neighbors thing about your musical skills. (You know, bring over a six-pac or call the cops.) Or soft enough to play along with your iPod. Or with headphones. How an amp sounds and what you can do with it is a personal thing. Playing my guitar along with friends or my iPod is fun and this amp works just fine for me. This amp is easy to recommend."
5,"Great amp, great price!","I was told by many people my les paul would sound better on a marshall amp than a fender, Boy, were they wrong. Marshall amps are good but after testing this and a marshall amp, I found the fender amp to be much cleaner, sounding better, and even has a bigger wattage! 25 instead of 15 the marshall would give you which was still 50 bucks more. I traded for this amp and am absolutley happy."
4,Torpedo Level,"I bought this level as a spare because it appears as if Empire makes the current Sears Craftsman Professional torpedo level, which I already have and like. As a professional, I needed a lightweight, accurate, and solid level. The picture shows the aluminum frame as a natural aluminum color, when in fact it came painted black, which I don't care for."
5,great quality product,i use this level at work everyday all day for a month now. i am pleased with the quality and durability of this product. the vials are easy to read and it looks great . make sure both magnets sit flat on work piece . i recommend this product to everybody.
3,shampoo,"this is a nice smelling shampoo,lathers great.it just didn't work on my hair,left it heavy and not feeling clean.i have normal hair a little oily at times,so it wasn't forme."
4,Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo,"This is a very good shampoo and I am very satisfied with it. The large container (33.8 oz.) is a very good buy, too."
1,I lost my hair!,"I shampooed my hair with this about a year and a half ago, because I love Paul Mitchell products and wanted to try a new shampoo. Within days I was losing my hair. I have beautiful long dirty blonde hair, one of my best assets, and it was devastating. I knew that since I had made a recent change to a different shampoo, that must have been it. I changed back to my original shampoo - Paul Mitchell's Special Tea Tree shampoo, and I quit losing my hair. I definately recommend Tea Tree shampoo over Awapuhi."
3,More watery compared to years before,"I first discovered this shampoo about 12 years ago from my hairdresser. The scent is really amazing. It truly is the best-smelling shampoo I've ever found. It also makes my hair full and leaves it clean. When I saw it listed on Amazon I was excited and ordered the biggest bottle available. The shampoo still smells the same, however it is much more watery than when I used to buy it from my salon 12 years ago. I suspect this is purposeful and a way from the company to make more money, but I was disappointed. Not cool, Paul Mitchell."
1,Bad for hair,"I used paul mitchell shampoo (original and tea tea), conditioner(original and tea tea), gel(original and tea tea), wax, and hair spray products. After 7 months of use, my hair start to thin out at the age of 24. I stopped it for 6 months and my hair has returned to normal. I would not recommend any paul mitchell product."
5,Great place to start!,"This is by no means the be all end all of Django books. I found this to be a fine place to start. Nobody can play exactly like Django, but they can try. Most musicians never completely work through an entire music book either. This is one you will most likely read and play from cover to cover. I felt accomplished by being able to ""play"" all the tunes!I would suggest getting the Django Definitive tab book next if you choose to be lazy and not read music...and of course start listening to Django 24 hours a day. Despite what one reviewer wrote, there are some really good recordings out there... the proper box and the 10cd box on ebay are both pretty good deals with listenable tunes."
2,Jazz selections from three early albums,"This two disc offering is not really a ""best of"" compilation, rather is a recap of three early albums. Most selections were written by members Skipper Wise and Ed Cohen. Disc One selections are from ""Windows"" (their debut) and ""Is It Safe?"". Disc Two is the entire album of ""Mr. Bongo"". Only the ""Gabriella"" selection by member Tim Timmermans had a very good melody and stood distinctly from the others. I am not enough of a jazz fan for variations on weak melodies and was not won over by several listens."
2,Not the quality I've seen from Florsheim in the past,"I've had at least one pair of florsheim dress shoes for regular use since the late 80s. My current pair is the one being reviewed here. After about 6 months, right shoe had the outside seam going down the heal started coming unstitched. I was able to overlook this quality issue since it only unstitched about 1 inch and did not effect the wearability. Today, about 2 years since purchase, the same shoe had the sole split across the middle. There is still lots of wear available on the sole, it seems that the material chosen for the sole was not a good choice. I'll be buying some replacement shoes but they won't be Florsheim ... I don't think they are the quality shoes they used to be."
3,Enlightening,"After reading many of the works by Jeff Shaara, I found 'Gone For Soldiers' very enlightening. It was not my favorite of his books, but getting to look at the early career of Robert E. Lee and the end of a career for Winfield Scott was very interesting.The story involves the Mexican-American war. Winfield Scott has taken over control of the US forces from Zachary Taylor. Taylor would later become president of the US. Gen. Scott realizes the skills of a young Capt Lee, who has been working as an engineer.It is improtant to keep in mind that this book is a fictional version of the events. Not all of the dialog is accurate, but it is very interesting. We also get a glimpse at a number of soldiers who will make their marks in the up coming Civil War.If you emjoyed the Civil Wat trilogy, you may enjoy a look at the early careers of these soldiers. It is amazing to see how much the politics of that age effected (for good and bad) the military events of the wars."
2,A Dutiful Son,"My biggest beef against Jeff Shaara is that he's not really a writer, but a dutiful son carrying on the franchise started by his father, a real writer, who wrote one great book, The Killer Angels. That said, Gone For Soldiers is an adequate read, though certainly not on the par with Patrick O'Brian, Bernard Cornwell, or others of that genre. The dialogue is forced and the research is shoddy, and it really drags at many points. Also, the characters are not beleivable. If you want to read a truly well written book in the same general time frame, pick up Stephen Harrigan's Gates Of The Alamo or The Borderlands by Edwin Shrake."
4,"A great ""non-fictional"" story","I am interested in the forgotten wars of this great country of ours... America. I saw this book, and had to read it. While you read this book, you feel like you are there with Lee. As he steps off the boat at Vera Cruz, scouts for alternate routes to outflank Santa Ana, deals with his superiors... It is a great story, and I am glad I came across this book. Suggestion for the author: Please write one involving the War of 1812!"
4,Facinating and enjoyable read,"I have read all of Mr. Shaara's novels, this one is a bit below them since it does not flow as smooth, and I got the feeling that he took too much ""liberties"" with the characters. There is no way for us to know exactly what was said, and who was thinking what, but I felt he went a little beyond his ""Gods and Generals"", and ""The Last Full Measure"" being much more free with historical characters.Mr. Shaara did justice to General Scott, who to this day does not get the credit he deserved, but I think he got a bit confused with the character of R.E. Lee in his youth.All in all, I really enjoyed reading the book and if you enjoyed this author's previous works, you'll enjoy this one also."
3,OK - Shaara's Done Better,"It thought ""Gone For Soldiers"" was OK, but I didn't like it nearly as much as ""The Last Full Measure"" or ""Rise to Rebellion"" (which, in my opinion, is Jeff Shaara's only work that rivals his father's ""Killer Angels"")."
3,"Moderately interesting, but...","A moderately interesting account of the U.S. expeditionary forces under Gen. Winfield Scott...that is, if you can stomach Shaara's nauseating adulation of Robert E. Lee, who - for no historically accurate reason - is the novel's main character. (Read it - you'll see what I mean.)"
2,"Don't Spoonfeed Me, Give Me Something To Chew On","As an enthusiastic reader of Shaara's past work I was excited to begin this one but found it soft and flat. I was constantly bothered by little unimportant words and phrases that should have been edited out while important questions, such as the whole San Patricio issue, were glossed over. I enjoyed the battle scenes, particularly Jackson's heroic and efficient working of his artillery and Grant's flanking maneuver, but it lacked the in-depth view into the character's heads and historical detail that I've come to expect."
4,"Enjoyable, though not the author's best work","I rate ""Gone For Soldiers"" slightly below the author's two previous works, ""Gods & Generals"" and ""The Last Full Measure."" The narrative is a bit slow at times, but on balance, I found the book entertaining. The Mexican War has been a recent interest of mine, but I have been unable to find too many books on this subject. This book -- though a novel -- filled a void for me, and seemed to be reasonably accurate historically, based on the previous non-fiction books I've read on this era."
5,Phenomenal to say the least!,"I read Gone For Soldiers AFTER reading the great Shaara Civil War trilogy, because I wanted to understand the early days of Lee, Grant, and others. I fell in love with the great General Winfield Scott (Old Fuss and Feathers) who was sort of the MacArthur of that day. The Mexican American War is not a part of history I knew much about. It was a fascinating time and battle. Best of all was the insight into the characters of the men we meet later on, in the Civil War. I actually recommend reading first the trilogy, Gods and Generals, The Killer Angels, and The Last Full Measure, before reading Gone For Soldiers...you'll appreciate it much more this way. Also I must comment that in this book Jeff Shaara has really developed into a fine writer who is no longer in his father's shadow."
5,Gone for Soldiers,Mr Shaara captures the essence of the time period and military history. He mixes fictional characters with real figures and real events to bring history alive not only for history buffs but also for the casual reader.
3,Gone for Soldiers: A novel of the Mexican War,Good plot and it kept me interestred. I was also fascinated how many of the characters go on to subsequently play important roles in the US Civil war and politics.
3,Gone for Soldiers,"A general's-eye view of the Mexican War.Well, it's better than his Revolutionary War books; it's got some characterization and moves reasonably fast. Still, I never felt drawn in, which is a pity, since there aren't a lot of novels on the Mexican War out there. I really think that the emphasis on using only real historical people as protags is a crutch of sorts, and the effect is to make the characterization seem less believable than it would if the characters were invented.Reasonably enjoyable, but not great fiction."
4,"Well done, very good historical fiction.",I am very impressed with Jeff Shaara's novel. I learned a great deal of history and couldn't put it down. Certain aspects of the campaign are neglected but everything is at least touched on.
1,Could Not Finish It,"I entered the Mexican-American War with great expectations for the Shaara literary reputation and, after reading the account of the Siege of Vera Cruz, was unable to finish it. I even violated my own 100-page rule requiring me to give any book that chance before forming an opinion and making a go/no-go decision. If there is Shaara brilliance here I did not detect it. I had high hopes of filling in the prequel to the American Civil War but I became impatient with the stodgy, lifeless prose. Perhaps a duller account can be found. I don't know. It plays loose with the facts of the Siege of Vera Cruz and not once in all the prolonged bombardment of the walls of Vera Cruz did I feel the sand fleas biting at my face. I regret the $7.00 for the e-book. -----Jerry Persall"
3,Not enough,Where this book brings to light many of the interesting relationships developed during the Mexican War it fails to capture the drama of this very important episode in our history. The battle scenes are strangely dry and without emotion. The story does not deal with the slavery issue at all. Yet we know this was a matter that was under considerable debate. All in all with the dearth of books on the Mexican War this novel does give an excellent background for future readings.
2,Gone For Soldiers,"The book is excellent if the reader is unaware of the history surrounding the Mexican War. I felt it was inferior to Gods and Generals, largely because some of the characters (especially Santa Anna and Scott) emerge as cartoon-like representations of themselves. Not horrible, but not quite what I had come to expect from the Shaaras."
4,First Rate Historical Novel,"This novel masterfully intertwines the history of the Mexican War with the careers of officers who continued into the American Civil War, helping the reader understand how and where some of the North's and South's better-known generals gained their initial combat experience.The author provides thumbnail sketches of several of these noteworthy military leaders at the end of the book."
4,excellent tale of the Mexican War,"Jeff Shaara combines history and story telling to bring a remarkable tale of the 1847 Mexican War. Gen Winfield Scott leads an assault at Vera Cruz to crush Santa Anna's uprising and finally put an end to his power in Mexico. The battle scenes are vidily written and explode across the page. What is so fascinating are the combining of Civil War generals Lee, Johnston, Grant and Jackson into this pre-civil war epic. Gen WInfield Scott, of course, was the leader of the Union Army at the start of the Civil War. A mere shell of the great general in this book."
4,Another Shaara triumph!,"Jeff Shaara has done his father proud again, and written a top of the line historical novel. He succeeds in taking many of the familiar figures from his and his father's Civil War novels to their first taste of war, this time against Mexico. Thrilling battle descriptions, thoughtful analysis of the main characters views and personalities, and accurate depictions of the politics surrounding Manifest Destiny make this account shine. One of the best aspects is how he makes the neglected contributions of Winfield Scott alive once again with his compelling testimony. More on Santa Ana would have been nice, but seeing it is a prequel, the focus is understandably around the American side."
3,A so-so,"This guy isn't a real writer, he just caries on his father bussiness. It's a good book, but a little boring at times."
2,"Franchise Literature, Ulysses: The Prequel","I purchased this book believing it to be authored by the man who wrote the great ""Killer Angels"" and neeless to say I was very disappointed. I think ""Gone..."" is an example of what I like to call ""franchise thinking"": you take a good idea and through copying it or applying it to other things you drain the life out of it. Franchise thinking prevents any change or attempts at something new; why bother? We found a formula that works, lets beat it to death (Killer Angels WWII, anyone?) . While not exactly horrible, the book is offfensive because Shaara Jr is cranking out nepotistic retreads of his father's great book. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are enough middle-brow military buffs out there to keep him in business."
4,Interesting read,It was interesting and enjoyable to see many of the generals from the Civil War as young men facing combat for the first time. While not the writer is father was Jeff does a better job of providing historical details and insights. I found the action scenes particularly well done.
2,Not so good,"Jeff Shaara seems to be riding his father's coatails here more than ever. The historical detail is fine and good, but he has no knack for dialogue. All the characters--from Lee to Santa Anna--sound exactly the same: unbelievable."
3,"Expected more, but still good","I think I expected more of the characters from the Civil War to grace the pages of this novel. The book is good, but a letdown after reading Shaara's Civil War trilogy. The subject just isn't as compelling. However, we do see the development of Robert Lee and we can see how the experiences of the Mexican War shaped his beliefs and strategies for his future role as commanding general for the South. Also, the influence that Winfield Scott has on Lee is strong."
3,"An okay book, but not great....","This book is okay, and enjoyable for readers of historical fiction, but the moments of humor or action do not completely redeem some tedious spots. The book focuses too much on Robert E. Lee, who isn't nearly as interesting a character as, say, Santa Anna or Grant. The book also ignores the battles for New Mexico and California to focus mostly on Scott's march, which should have a secure spot in history. Still, it is a good read, even if not up to his father's level. It is a pity the father was not more productive as a writer so we would not have needed the son."
1,Irritatingly Eccentric Writing Style,"I was certainly looking forward to reading Shaara's book, not having read his previous works. But the writing style was so off-putting and the dialogue so interchangeable that, frustrated, I gave up early in the game and didn't get a quarter into it. The introduction was so much better written than the narrative that I wish Shaara had written a nonfiction work about the period. Some sample eccentricities, of which the book is replete: ""No one spoke, knew Scott did not require an answer."" ""He shook his head, said, 'What the hell is the matter. . . .'"" ""Lee saluted, did not hesitate, followed Scott down the narrow passageway."" ""Scott did not look at Lee, turned, said, 'We may proceed.'"""
4,Informative but too long,"As a Civil War buff I enjoyed this historically accurate account of this little known war. Rightfully so, R.E. Lee and Gen. Scott occupy the central roles with minor roles being played by key characters that reappear during the Civil War. Santa Anna was a real buffoon and Shaara did a good job depicting him as such. The novel was a little too long and it did not quiet measure up to his Father's work with Killer Angels or with his own Civil War novels."
4,Before they were enemies,"Gone for Soldiers is a historical novel of a war most Americans know little or nothing about. Thirteen years before America's tragic Civil War, men who would soon be enemies fought side by side as brothers in arms. Gone for Soldiers follows the exploits of General Winfield Scott and his right hand man and engineer, Robert E. Lee. As in all of his historical novels, weaves historically accurate information along with deeply personal characterizations to create a page turning novel. It never ceases to amaze me how Jeff Shaara picked up the mantle of his father."
4,it's history with character added.,"Jeff Shaara contuies this series started by his father, this time looking at the Mexican war. This often overlooked war was very important in devoloping the people who would decide the fate of the nation ten years later. The book was rather weak in a couple of areas, and should have been longer. Not nearly enough attention and detail was put into decribing the statagy that general Scott used in this war. Wellington personaly praised Scott as one of the best generals of his generation for his Mexican campain.The most glaring oversight was how little attention was given to Grant and Longstreet in this book (only one chapter each). This is puzzling consitering that Grant himself wrote a consiterable amount about his experiances in this war in his memoirs(which are worth reading for people interested in this time period). While they didn't play quite as crutial parts as Scott or Lee, they certianly are important to the history of the time."
4,Slow Start,"Having not read one of Shaara's books before, I was tempted to put it down after the introduction. In that section, the characters we are to meet in the body of the text are presented in a series of one-dimensional, criptic sentences reminiscent of a high school term paper. Fortunately, the players become more alive and the writing more flowing as the story proceeds. The period in U. S. history prior to the Civil War has always held interest for me and, having visited a number of the places in Mexico described in the book, I may find the subject matter more interesting than some. Although not a novel, I found Eisenhower's ""So Far from God"" a more readable and comprehensive presentation of the military and polictical aspects of the Mexican American War."
