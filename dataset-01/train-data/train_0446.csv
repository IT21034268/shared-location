5,The Spy who loved me,Love all J Bond films. This is one of the better Roger Moore fims. Barbera Bach is lovely. Great gadgets too.
4,Good Bond for Kids,"My youngest two (8 & 11) have been working through some Bond movies. We started with the originals -- Dr No, Goldfinger, etc -- which they really liked. They're now enjoying Roger Moore and some of the campier Bond as well. How do you not like a helicopter chase and a submarine car?"
5,Nobody does it better,"Baby, this one's the best!Until I saw ""From Russia With Love,"" this was my favorite Bond film. I really love it. The plot is about Karl Stromberg, who wants to wipe out world population and start new life under the sea, which is sorta like Hugo Drax in Moonraker. This film also features the first appearence of Jaws, played by 7 ft. 2 Richard Keil.Roger Moore is great as Bond, and the film has great action, like every Bond film. My favorite scene is the final battle in the boat, and the flood in Atlantis, Stromberg's lair.This DVD has great extras, like a documentary on the making of (which focuses a lot on the ski jump before the opening credits), a documentary on the brilliant set designer Ken Adam, and trailers and commentary.It's one of the best. Period."
1,"the spy who loved me , a review by xelah1234","I personly think that this is one of the worst bond films amaginable. Along with goldfinger,thunderball, and for your eyes only this is a bond movie that has no plot. The final outcome of this movie is so bad.... if you are starting to make a james bond collection dont buy the movies listed above."
4,Gotta Love Jaws,"This is a wonderfully silly example of how fun the James Bond movies can be. It came after a period where the Bond movies were sagging in quality a little (""Diamonds are Forever"", ""Live and Let Die,"" ""Man With the Golden Gun""), and turned out to be the best Bond movie since ""Goldfinger."" It's got some memorable scenes (the opening ski jump), and a great villain (not Curt Jurgens - I'm talking about Richard Kiel's Jaws, baby!)This disc is on par with most of the other James Bond DVDs. It has a very nice widescreen presentation with few scratches and good colours. It also has a full plate of extras, the most notable being ""The Making of The Spy Who Loved Me,"" in which the difficulty getting this movie off the ground is described in detail, and everyone basically praises it as Roger Moore's best Bond movie."
4,"""An entertainable 4 star action packed thriller!""","The Spy Who Loved me is an entertaining movie with a lot of good action and enough thrills to keep you glued to your seat. The cast is okay and so is the acting. It's in no way boring but who wants to see Bond figuring things out? I like the fights and the love scenes (Just kidding)The movie begins with an American and Russian sub disappearing from their mission. Russia sends their best agent, XXX, to check it out while America sends their best agent: Bond, James Bond! As the mystery unravels many surprises await the two agents! There's Jaws, the incredible big man with steel feet who just won't die even if Bond fights him on a train, in a car, in a submarine, and in this Egyptian place. Soon, the end comes and Bond discovers all the people from the two subs who sank and they help him fight the leader and his terrorists.A great movie with lots of stuff to keep you enjoyed. See it!"
4,Roger Moore's Finest Hour as Bond,"Moore's best outing as Bond. The film has the grand sets, solid production values, and cartoonish villainy typical of Moore's early run (the look and feel of his films shifted slightly from ""For Your Eyes Only"" out), though this time everything seems to gel. The script is solid by Bond standards, and the action is steady. Moore's take on the character was always a bit lighter than other actors, and in this outing the filmmakers have provided him with a script that caters to his light touch. That's not to say the producers have turned this Bond into some kind of comedy - hardly, as there's still the world to save and action a-plenty - but in this film they seem to have figured out that Moore played satire and verbal wit well. Moore will never be my favorite Bond, but there's little doubt that in this film, he won me over."
4,""" I need you James."" ""So does England.""","This is my second favorite of roger moores. The spy who loved me has a good solid story, even though it does share similarities with you only live twice. barbara bach played an excellent russian agent and she was cool, and yet never took anything away from bond. the lotus is an exciting car even today and the action scenes with it are very exciting. the movie is a little light on the gadgets. the end fight is big and grand and exciting. the dvd features are excellent and the 41min documentry is very informative, with short interviews with jaws and some of the bond girls as well as the director etc. the digital sound is clear, but there is very little use of the rear speakers, especally compared to world is not enough. but it is still an excellent movie and a good addition to your dvd libary."
5,"One of the best, no doubt","The spy who loved me remains one of the best bonds.Everything works- Lewis gilberts direction, the wonderful locations (Egypt,Sardinia e.t.c.) and of course the action scenes, including the now classic pre-credits ski chase and jump.Many people yearn for John barrys music,but for me Marvin hamlisch's terrific disco like score cannot be beaten.I would say nobody does it better,but everyone else will no doubt use it as well."
3,A film that was better in my memory,"This Bond movie has not aged well. The visual effects are pretty cheesy and it's unforgivable that a relatively well-produced film made in 1977 still contains obvious rear projection shots.Jokey super-villians, double entendres, luscious women - it's all here for Bond fans. Sadly despite being rather sauve, Roger Moore is far to old for the part. Barbara Bach probably comes off best despite her inability to change facial expressions.This was definitely a film that was better in my memory.As for the Ultimate Edition - do you really care about how this film was made?"
2,And that's just for the gadgets,"I can't believe there was a time when I loved all the Bond films without reservation. Now that they are being rereleased I started to purchase them...and now have stopped. Goldfinger is still briliant, but TSWLM is just vile. Barbara Bach as XXX is a babe, but one of the most vacuous performances on film. I used to slam on Denise (""I get to play a scientist"") Richards in The World Is Not Enough, but compared to Bach she's Meryl Streep with a hot bod. Get a pulse. Roger Moore saunters through this venture in his classic English stoicism with just a bit too much of Al Gore's stiffness. Yes, the gadgets are good, but even they lent themselves to Austin Powers style farce. This flick is too campy for a good action film but not campy enough to be a camp classic. Sad to say, but the more recent Pierce Brosnan Bond flicks far surpass this '70's drivel."
2,Oh dear oh dear,"Well, it's a romp for sure but not one of the best Bond's (unless you're really into 70's kitsch). Makes a perfect twin bookend to ""Moonraker"" as the two Bond movies that rather lost their way. More funny than thrilling."
3,"Fun At Times, But...","Of all the Bonds this is the most curiously overrated. While the later Moores are rightly regarded as weak -- this one has its share of passionate defenders. I'm not really sure why. Though entertaining, it's slick and frankly a little shallow. It makes the prior two in the series seem positively naturalistic by comparison. Marvin Hamlish's self-conscious, obnoxious musical pastiches are dreadful -- they take you right out of the movie. Barbara Bach is robotic in what could have been an effective female lead. (I hate to say all this as Sir Roger in his charming commentary track says this is his favorite and I'm grateful that he recorded these.)"
5,"Baby, Baby You're the Best","This is the Best of the Bond Films Starring Roger Moore. Barbara Bach is so sexy in this movie. Jaws is the ultimate bad guy. This film features Carly Simon's number 1 song ""Nobody does it better""."
4,Richard Kiel and Roger Moore.......,"I think this James Bond movie is very good. Specialy Richard Kiel. He's a very good actor, very strong and the giant of America!! The perfect anamy for Roger Moore! I hope that Richard Kiel come back this (or next) year as JAWS!!"
4,Nobody does it better than Barbara Bach; Moore is not so bad either,"I started watching some Bond movies again and came across this Ultimate Bond DVD. This is a fine film and fine DVD. Having watchedLive and Let Dielast night, the disappointment from that less-than-adventure almost prevented me from watching Spy. I am glad I persevered. This is really one of the better Bonds with Moore. There are many smarmy wisecracks here but they work just right. Somehow they got it right balancing the romance, the action, and the Moore.I particularly liked Barbara Bach: she perhaps isn't the finest actress they've had with the Bond girls, but she looks fantastic and offers a fine romantic foil to Bond.This DVD also is quite good. Moore provides, what he calls, a ""one-way conversation"" with you in the 2nd audio track. He is more amusing and charming as himself than as Bond. I let Moore go in the background while cleaning up the house and hooted many times. It is a very entertaining and warm addition to the DVD."
4,Where is Fekish!?,"Rank 16 of 23. Moore is terrific, I just didn't care for Barbara Bach. Also called Jaws one. Just never liked Triple X as a Bond girls, but loved Jaws!"
2,FIRST 80 MINUTES OF 2 HOURS ARE GOOD,"The fights and chases, and Barbara Bach, and Hammer's Caroline Munro, are nice---it's the climax that stinks!The explosions and shoot-outs on board a super tanker are as boring as the climatic oil rig nonsense of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (another Bond movie where the lead-up is a lot better than the climax).Ken Adams' super tanker set is a throw back to the 1960s, and not in a nice way; it looks like a reject from a '60 spy movie. The red uniforms for the villain's crew are also a leftover from '60s tackiness.The first 80 minutes of this movie are worth watching a number of times. The last 40 minutes can be skipped, thanks to modern science.UNDER SEIGE, a Steven Segal movie, is a better directed, and more exciting thriller set on board a ship."
3,Deep House,"Its okay i expected more gooves for the asking price, about5 cuts have that swagger that house is known for."
4,Not too bad,"This book was definitely a little different from the previous three. But it was still charming in its own way. Lestat's experiences in the human body alone are worth reading it, I found them hilarious. If you are a Vampire Chronicles fan, and you read the first three books, read it, you won't be dissapointed. The only thing I didn't like was that homosexuality level went way up in this one. I didn't mind the innocent kisses between Lestat and Louis or Nikki in the previous books, but what is up with Lestat trying to get into David's pants while he is in a human body?! I think I could have done without that. Overall it was good though."
4,A fun read,"Though I tend to prefer the first three Vampire Chronicles- Interview with the vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the damned this still remains on my list of favorites by Anne Rice.Be warned, Lestat is extremely naive in this story and there are a few slight continuity errors. It is very much a fun read though with some moments of decidedly dark humor. Though I do feel Queen of the damned had the best closure for the book series this novel is still very satisfying on multiple levels. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed the first three Vampire Chronicles. It's just fun."
3,This is not like her other books,"Her other books are a page turner, this one, however could have been much better. It is slow in many parts of the book, and not as suspenseful as her other books. If you are a Rice fan, you still may find this a good read. Just don't expect it to be like her past works."
4,"Excellent, but I got bored in the first 100 pages","I loved ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""The Queen of the Damned"", and i thought this one would be similar, but i was wrong. It was a very excellent novel with only a few selected characters in it. When I first started reading it, it took me 4 days to get past the first 100 pages. But when Lestat finally exchanged bodies I couldn't put it down. I thought that this novel was the most adventurous than the others. I couldn't put it down, I finished it in 2 days."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"As in all Rice novels you must go into it with an open mind. Although I would like to see more of the others, particularly Marius, It is still a good one. Don't give up on the series, you will find the vampire your compatible with somewhere in Rice's gothic world..."
5,An unforgettable and haunting tale of passion.,"Tale of the Body Thief is one of the best books I have ever read. I've started others written by Anne Rice, but wasn't as impressed as I was with this one. I think she is in her best form when she writes in the first person, as she does in Body Thief. I like the way she lets us look into the darkest depths of the human soul through the eyes of the vampire Lestat.The book is erotic, but in subtle ways. You won't find any vivid sex scenes, but better yet, you will feel desires and anquish of the characters."
4,You don't know what you have until you lose it,"I really enjoy reading Anne's vampire cronicles, and this book gave me the possibility of seeing Lestat as a normal human being and I found that even as a common mortal he is special that is why he is a special vampire."
5,"Good, Very Good.","Lestat speaks. Vampire-hero, enchanter, seducer of mortals. For centuries he has been a courted prince in the dark and flourishing universe of the living dead. Lestat is alone. And suddenly all his vampire rationale--everything he has come to believe and feel safe with--is called into question. In his overwhelming need to destroy his doubts and his loneliness, Lestat embarks on the most dangerous enterprise he has undertaken in all the danger-haunted years of his long existence.I found the book to differ in style from the first two, and of course the third, since it took the form of a fairytale in storytelling and a movie in the implementation of suspence moments and event construction."
2,Lestat comes way out of the closet,"I thought the first 3 vampire books were great. Then Rice tried to make a forth book in what should have been a trilogy. More subtle signs of affection between vampires to help them cope with their immortality is replaced with rampant homosexuality in thought, word, and deed. It got boring very quickly when page after page has Lestat wanting to have sex with anything that moves. His character along with half the characters in the book turned into a bunch of gays that didn't have the interesting sides they showed in the previous books. It makes me wonder if Rice got a hefty sum of money from the gay community to make a book portraying even vampires as homosexual."
4,Not her greatest but a good read,"Not Anne Rice's greatest novel, but fun to read. The vampire Lestat is once again the main character and the story turns out a little predictable but a fun read anyway. I am currently reading the next book in the Vampire Chronicles series. If you've read her work at all you will like the story."
5,Still the Best,"I marveled at the complexity of this novel. Although I finished in in one and a quarter days, I had to read it again to soak up the details and plots in the novel.As Lestat thinks it is horrible to be mortal again, I examine my life and compare it to his. In my opinion, I really wish vampires were real and that I could be a vampire. It is kinda pathetic of me, but hey: look at it this way. Right now I have a cold that persists on staying, I can't fly, I need food a lot, and it would just be so amazing to live so long and experience the world anew.Even at the beginning when Lestat attempts to commit suicide, I knew he really wouldn't actually want to die. He loves himself too much. Hey, I love him also, so how can he resist? He really is irrisistible...*sigh* Sooooooooooo HOT!!!!This is my third favourite after Blood Canticle and The Queen of the Damned. Anyhow, it was a great novel to be cherished in my heart forever."
2,I Love Anne Rice But...,"I have always been a big Ann Rice fan and have read most of her books. The tale of the body thief was an interesting tale where Lestat has the opportunity to become human by switching bodies with a human by astral projection. It sounds like the beginning of a fantastic journey, but unfortunately, I was disappointed. It just seemed like there was something missing in the story. There was lots of potential, but most of it was left untapped. I consider this the weakest of all the Vampire Chronicles series."
3,Are these Vampires or Abused Actors?,"Far from being nasty bloodsucking monsters Anne Rice has done more to convince us that vampires are nice people with a bit of an appetite. LEstat who can't help but answer for everything he does without making himself sound like a saint suddenly gets Louis syndrome and starts complaining. Pretty soon Louis seems funloving, and Lestat is the whiner. One major plot hole is the question--if the guy that Lestat allowed to have his body didn't want to give it back, why didn't he just kill Lestat when Lestat was human and save himself the trouble of losing? I liked the dog but the rest was merely signs and portents to the final dismal unravelling of all that was good in the series in Memnoch. I can't say it enough---with Lost SOuls Poppy Z. Brite made us all know what kind of middleclass pompous dullards pass for vampires in Anne Rice's world. By this book, forget about Anne Rice. Read Poppy Z. Brite"
4,How we love Lestat,"Lestat appears again in this dynamic adventure story. The one willing to go all the way, whether death or doom surrounds him, he takes the risk and inevitably wins. Unfortunately his selvishness usually hurts, maims or kills (in one way or another) the ones he loves. One is appalled and enthralled by his antics in this non-stop adventure. Ms Rice has a great imagination or perhaps she perceives exactly the right illusion that we, her audience desire and crave for. The beauty of her characters and destinations are so alluring to human desire that we cannot but be swept away by them in our fantasies. Will Memnoch do the same thing for me or force to me to change tak. I suspect the latter. But I hope to be challenged never-the-less."
3,Good but not as good as the other ones in the series,"This seemed kind of like a short story to me. It was good but I like the other ones better. There were alot of surprises in here, I didn't even really know what it was going to be about right away. But I think the only people that would really enjoy the book are those who have read the preceding novels which really stand out on their own. But it's still a good book."
3,Better than Queen of the Damned but still just an OK read,"This book was better than the horrible Queen of the Damned however it was not a great read itself. I found much of the book to be predictible and the end of the book to be completely pointless. Even with the predictiblity of this book at least it was not as BORING as Queen, I didn't think that book would ever end it was a miserable read for me."
3,Its ok,"This book is not her best, but its essential if you want to continue the tale of the vampires. Better books to follow!"
2,Ms Rice should have stopped after 3 books,"This fourth volume of THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES is a real disappointment. After the seductive perfection of her original trilogy, Rice has taken Lestat (whom she is obviously besotted with) and jettisoned all the rest of the characters we came to know and love in the first three books. Also, the story takes the vampire legends way out into left field, with Lestat actually inhabiting a mortal's body. Interesting stuff, but Lestat on his own gets tiresome; I found myself hoping that Louis or Armand or Marius would show up. After a certain point, without the others as a buffer, Lestat becomes quite tedious and the book ends up being boring. Somehow this volume doesn't fit with the first three; Ms Rice should have left it as a trilogy."
2,I don't like it,"It's hard for me to believe that this book is in the same series as the other three books in this set. I don't know what happened when this book was penned, but it isn't even in the same class as the others as far as I am concerned. I spent much of the time I was reading this book bored out of my mind and wondering how the same author could have possibly written this.The characters didn't have much life, (even for the undead) and the descriptions over every little thing were just overkill. The main character came across as rather duncical and naive which was sad considering how exciting and determined he was in other books. I really can'the recommend this one, but the rest of the series is great and definitely worth reading."
3,Interesting Story,"This is my least favorite of the Vampire Chronicle stories. It took longer to get into and longer to finish than the first books of the series. While I still enjoyed it, it just didn't seem to fit with the other books in the series."
5,"If you love the chronicle, I wouldn't skip this one.","I'm about half way through, and just loving it. Very much enjoying David as a central focus. I am not finding much in the way of the criticisms that others have had of the book. Maybe their expectations were too high, as some of the other chronicles are just phenomenal. I DON""T recommend this one if you're just staring with these books. You should know the characters a bit first. But like I said, I wouldn't skip this one, and you couldn't pay me to stop reading it."
3,Necessary story points here.........,"I read these books slightly out of order, I read Memnoch the Devil before this book and should not have. You need the information about ""David"" from this book first. Otherwise Lestat was acting like a senseless teenager pulling the stunts that he pulled in this book. Who would have thought he would have done such irresponsible things. Otherwise the book is a necessary read, but fear not, the very best follows with Memnoch, my favorite one so far."
5,Enticing Story,"This is the first book I read of the vampire chronicles. I could not put this book down until I had finished it, which meant staying up very late at night for a couple of nights. I fell in love with the character of the vampire Lestat. Despite his flaws, you cannot but find him adorable and will forgive him anything. His friend David is also wonderful. You will not forget these two guys for quite a while. I felt sad the day I finished this book for I wanted more and more of the intricate descriptions and scenes, emotional dialogues and the philosophical discussions on good and evil. I am now very encouraged to read the other chronicles. I sincerely hope that they live up to the expectations I have of them after reading this book. A wonderful, wonderful read!"
3,Not one of Anne's best books,"I really want to rank this book as highly as ""Queen of the Damned"" and ""The Vampire Lestat"" but I just can't. I found the book to be only so-so. Still the concept of Lestat experiencing the daily rituals of human life was interesting. He hasn't been human for over two hundred years and totally forgot about all the little nuances that humans experience daily. Lestat was completely naive to think that this body thief would be willing to return his body back in several days as promised. His friend David Talbot (introduced in ""Queen of the Damned"") even warns Lestat to not go through with this body switching.The subject of body switching is rather old. After all, Hollywood has run this subject into the ground. I like this book but not as much as ""Queen of the Damned"" and ""The Vampire Lestat"". I can't say I hate it completely either. I just found ""The Tale of the Body Thief"" a bit dull on my part but don't take my word for it."
4,A new twist in the Vampire chronicles.,"I love this book. It's almost like a mystery novel. You don't have to like vampires to enjoy it. It's an exciting read, nothing happens the way you think it will. Around each corner is a surprise adventure. The character's are change constantly, as he flows in and out of different bodies. It's fun to read, and not scarey. I can read through a third of the book without realizing it. My advice is to read it over a weekend, you will be compelled to finish it. Then you wish it didn't end."
2,"Christina from London, not impressed","Yes, I'm afraid I'm the odd one out who doesn't find Tale of the Body Thief a fantastic read. First of all, David Talbot gay!?, give us a break! Reading this new development in the Vampire Chronicles made me realise how much they are starting to have plots as ridiculous as Dallas. If we had been given hints in Queen of the Damned of his homosexual inclinations, well, then it would have been credible, but not this way, out of the blue. What next? Lestat and Talbot have a baby and call him Adonis?"
1,There's a reason trilogies are effective,"This is where Anne Rice really started to lose me. I was never a huge fan of her work but i did enjoy the first three books in the series, especially Queen of the Damned. A bit too homoerotic and whistfully romantic for my tastes. Basically she's turning the series here into harlequin romance fodder, only with bisexual vampires instead of fabio-like characters. The best thing that can be said for this book is that it's not nearly as bad as the abyssmal Memnoch, one of the worst books I have ever read."
2,This Is When,"Sadly, this novel and Taltos mark the point where Anne Rice ""jumped the shark"". ""The Witching Hour"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" were her last two good novels, and they were great. Everything afterwards, including ""Tales of the Body Thief"" have the hallmarks of poor writing, obviously pumped out as quickly as possible to make money, and confused theology."
1,PLEASE!,What happened to the interesting storylines? This was a high disppointment after the wonderment of Interview and Lestat. I felt Queen of the damned was a bit jumbled but this is a ludicrous cartoon of Lestat.
3,"Well written, but not a VAMPIRE CHRONICLE!!","Like I said, this book was extreamly well written. I love her prose, but I went into this book expecting a story about the past of a vampire, not the present of Lestat. And that's another problem: Lestat, again. She already ruined him by turning him into a ""noble"" killer. He was the vampire that we all loved to hate in Interview, but now, ugh. And then when she upped his power, even worse. Now we get to learn about all of his troubles and sacrifices when he becomes human again. The best thing she did was end the book with him going back and doing something that he would have done in the first book."
3,Too Much,This book goes into too many details at some moments in the book. You start to wonder when will it get to the point. Yet the ending is really exciting
3,The Book Is So-So,"What WAS exciting about this book was the prospect of Lestat being human again. It was interesting to see the unexpected challenges faced by being mortal again. And the free spirit in me DID enjoy the homosexual content--meow! (Made me wish I were a guy!)However, after awhile the book left me high and dry. I believe the story should have ended with the fantastical ""Queen Of The Damned"". Readers who look closely will realize this book is a reflection of Anne Rice's personal struggles with morality and faith, and it might as well be an emotional bibliography.I have great respect for Anne Rice, but ""Queen"" and the whole ""Witching Hour"" series has been her superb work to date. ""Body Thief"" might have been a bit more believable, but it wasn't."
2,One Of The Biggest Disappointments I Have Seen In Horror.,"What can I say about the Vampire Chronicles? They were refreshing and new! That were exciting! That is, until this novel came out. The one pictures is a Knopf Canada first edition that I bought as soon as this novel was released. Unfortunately it was a mistake.I loved the first three novels in the Chronicles, but this one is radically different. It takes place in the present time which isn't too bad. Lestat, becomes human once again and has quite an adventure.I felt like I was reading a Superman novel. Lestat was relegated to superhero status whom had just swallowed Kryptonite and lost all his powers. The love scenes in the novel we all guys! Not my fetish, I'd prefer not to hear about how my once favorite vampire would secretly love to sleep with his friends.Lestat and this novel got so wishy washy that it was the last of the Anne Rice novels I ever read, and I loved Anne Rice's previous works! Too bad."
5,amazing!,"When I went to Englan for university, this quickly became my #1 beverage of all time. It tastes like hypersweet grape juice, but more like our artificial grape in america than real grape. It's simply amazing..."
1,Very thin,"This sheet is very thin and not soft at all. It almost didn't even feel like we had a sheet on the mattress. Since the layer underneath was plastic, there was no breath-ability and it made him sweat really badly."
3,"Started out good, but sank","When I first placed this on our bed, it was nice and fluffy, but it over a month or two it sank in the spots where we normally sleep. Overall I'm not extremely happy with it."
4,Took off a star because of the stiff foam pad....,"Though, if you replaced the original foam with memory foam, it might be perfect!Since I already had a 3 inch memory foam topper, I simply removed the original foam and, I have to say, I have slept much more soundly since getting it. I love the ""cuddly"" feel, and the original foam will be put to another use...I, too, got it in the Gold Box Deal...;0))PK"
1,not as described,"This bed cover is not 4"" thick. It is not much better than a cheap foam pad. I am very disappointed in this product."
2,Over promised,"Don't get your expectations up on this one. It consists of a topper cover, some thin fiber fill pockets and a layer of ordinary sheet foam. The whole thing can't be more than two inches tops. It's really just a regular mattress topper, nothing special."
4,Works great,Mirror works great. The measurements in the add are for the shipping box not the mirror. I contacted the seller about this issue and they credited me with a partial refund. I was looking for a mirror the size of the shipping box. Would recomend seller and mirror to any that are looking.
2,older yes newer no,"I really like the shape and that it's not glass . BUT SALT AIR MAKES THE SURFACE PIT i wax once a month . I buy one every year for the last 5 years .[ i'm a glutton for punishment] about 6 years ago i bought one for a friend of mine' and with no pitting at all , and very little maintance it still looks brand new.this tells me that the older mirrors had thicker plateing . go back to heavier plateing i'll pay the extra money. zirmack and salt don't mix RON"
2,Mounting system is horrible,"No matter what I do, no matter what I try and jury rig, no matter WHAT.. this thing pops off the windshield frame. Something about the angle of everything lining up is just not right. Avoid."
5,Definitive,This is the most thoughtful and honest approach to Job that I have encountered. A must for the serious student of theology.
2,Not suitable,"I bought this DVD for my junior high classroom, but it was not suitable for viewing to 7th grade students."
3,"Interesting, but a little dry","I ordered this to show to my 6th grade class when we started a unit on mythology. Although the documentary is well-done, the kids started getting a little restless about half-way through. Maybe older kids would appreciate it more."
3,Hist Chnl G&G,"I found this video to be OK for its time-limited content. I would really like to seewhat they could do with a few HOURS of video,and less ""editorial supervision""....It seems thatthis is really a watered down version designed to keep the general public dumb concerningthe vast importance and wide spread influence of these mythical solar gods... However, itis good mindless entertainment."
1,These things stink!,"So my dog loves the regular dingo treats so I thought I'd try the beef variety. Got them and when I opened the bag, the smell hit me. My mother growing up was a smoker and the smell of these treats are exactly like an overfilled ash tray. So if you are put off by smoking or the smell of used cigarettes, then I can not recommend these to you. I can though however recommend the regular dingo treats. My dog goes nuts for the giant ones."
3,Not sure about rawhides for dogs,I have heard some negative things about raw hides for dogs and associated stomach problems if they eat too much. My miniature schnauzer never really took a liking to chewing on things for a long time so these are a good size and make me feel better that they limit how much she can eat. It just worries me a little bit how fast she eats them.
2,Nasty Smell,"Smells like it's been dipped in chemicals. My dog loves them, but I can't see how they can be healthy with that coating. They will dirty light-colored carpets."
3,Dog loves it but made in China,"I'm of mixed feelings on this product. My dog really likes these rawhide bones and will munch on one readily, but I noticed that they are marked as ""Made in China"" on the back of the package. It could very well be that they have quality control in place to ensure these bones are safe for pets, but I've heard too many horror stories about this sort of thing to feel entirely comfortable.It's up to you as the purchaser to decide if you want to bother. My Keeshond-mix would heartily recommend these treats, but she doesn't know where China is."
4,well pleased,"Im not one for this type of album but im am very pleanstly surprise. Very Nicly done! Very Nice to listen to, have a nice glass of wine and just sit back and relax!"
1,"so very disappointed, worse than the old shocks i took out","i selected these shocks on the basis of the reviews i had read in general about tokico in car forums.what a piece of junk and how expensive.i am going to take the time and trouble to take them off the car and return them.honestly the front of the car bounces up and down more than when i had my old shocks.i avoided facing the obvious for months and avoided driving this car , i have more than one car .it is a ereal pain"
4,This game is better than it looks.,"Just by looking at the box you think it isn't any good. It is actually a pretty good game. This game is unlike other games. you don't have money to buy stuff w/ you earn your stuff. For example, you only start out w/ All Terrain tires and you earn snow tires by finding the nav buoy in an area. The game is pretty realistic about damage so, that means you have to be careful so you don't break an axle. That is probably the biggest drawback in the whole game. Overall, the game is fun and challengeing."
2,Cabela's 4X$ Off Road Adventure,"Being an avid off-roader, I had high hopes for this game. Perhaps too high. The graphics are rather cheap and additionally, I was looking for a game where you could choose brand-name, real-world vehicles with brand-name after-market mods (much like in the Need For Speed series). Instead you are treated to generic, grade-school level trucks, tires etc. The terrain is unrealistic, having exaggerated hills and canyons. Finally, I found the truck's ability to climb even the simplist of hills difficult. My STOCK Dodge Dakota can traverse some of the inclines better.I only recommend this game for the non-serious player."
3,Don't put it in the dishwasher!,"There is a reason the lifetime warranty excludes 'dishwasher damage'. It's because your dishwasher will destroy this pan.Over the course of a couple years and 100 or so washings, the bottom became etched, and it completely rotted out everyplace that had 'writing' on the back.And it warped . . .I feel I got my money's worth, and I now keep it in the camping box, ;)"
2,"A bit cheap, but then so was I",This is a bit cheaper than the price I paid. Power switch broke on first use and now the only way to turn it off is to unplug it. Not such a big surprise when I think that I bought it because it was cheap. It should have cost even less.
5,Bounce Light is the Bomb,If you have never owned a bounce light you are missing the boat on this on. I have used them in a automotive shop several years.Aside from driving over one with a vehicle they are virtually indestructible.
3,Dated early 80s comedy given a boost by Tom Cruise's star quality,"""Risky Business"" seems to be making a gentle crack at the corrupt and materialistic adult world. Tom Cruise plays a high school kid and reluctant ""future enterpriser"" who sets up a bordello in his parent's house while they are away on holiday. His materialistic parents seem more interested in their stereo, Porsche, holidays, and what college their son gets into rather than the feelings of their own son. The pre-AIDS sexual zeitgeist date the film somewhat but Cruise's star quality is plain for all to see. He turns the film into something far better than it deserves."
2,Teasing but Unfulfilling,"I am a great fan of Risky Business, but this edition is pretty disappointing. The picture quality and sound are fine, but you'd think with the advent of Blu-Ray and all of its storage capacity, that they could have actually spliced the director's cut last scene onto the movie! Instead, you have to watch the scene on its own, so it's impossible to tell how it really flows with the film.Also, I'd love to watch the commentary, but I refuse to watch it picture-in-picture, which is really distracting. Once again, where is the option to turn off the picture-in-picture?I'd love to buy Blu-Ray, bit it seems that you really need to wait and buy discs that take full advantage of the medium...otherwise it's a waste."
4,"""One Of Tom's Best!""","Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay star in this 1983 comedy-drama.While his parents are away, a teen meets a hooker and turns hishome into a brothel. This is one of Tom's best and this dvd hasgood picture and sound plus some neat extras. I recommendthis."
5,Great Movie!,"One of my all-time faves. A smart, edgy, funny movie about teenagers that doesn't take the low common denominator route of Porky's or the gazillion of other teenage sex comedies made in the 80's. Great, atmospheric synthesizer music by Tangerine Dream. Extremely well-directed (what is Paul Brickman doing these days?). I highly recommend this DVD."
4,No Risk here,"Fast shipping, good price. The bluray version is ok for as old as the movie is this is as good as the movie will ever look. If your a fan there is no risk.......buy it."
4,Sometimes you gotta say....,"Risky Business is the movie that turned Tom Cruise from an up and coming star to a sensation. Tom plays Joel Goodsen (read Good Son), a high school senior looking towards the Ivy League. His parents are away and left him alone in charge of the house.Everything is going fine until one of his friends sends over a hooker. This starts a cycle of events that will change Joel's life.This is a well written and directed film by Paul Brickman. With a fine film debut by Rebecca de Mornay as the call girl Lana.Tom became an overnight sensation but the rest of the his friends (Bronson ""Balki"" Pinchot, Curtis ""Moonlighting"" Armstrong and Raphael Sbarge) would have to go to television for success. Rebecca unfortunately got type cast from this film and she never got the roles that she deserved.This is a great film and shows what can be done when people are given a chance.DVD EXTRAS: None"
4,Best Tom Cruise movie of all,"A classic! ""I've got a trig midterm tomorrow and I'm being chased by Guido the Killer Pimp!"""
5,RISKY BUSINESS,"A FUN TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE....I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND IT'S RATED R, AS I RECALL IT AS POPULAR WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE TEENAGERS....THOUGHT MY TEEN GRANDCHILDREN WOULD ENJOY IT. BUT ALTHOUGH THEY SHOWED NO INTEREST, I ENJOYED IT A GREAT DEAL."
2,Typical 80s Teen Comedy,"Tom Cruise was about to reach super-stardom by 1983 and ""Risky Business"" along with ""Top Gun"" three years later made him a cinematic icon. Cruise's parents are going out-of-town and the youngster decides that it is time to take his father's porsche out for a spin. Of course disaster strikes and now Cruise needs money and needs it fast. An elaborate plan develops to set up a brothel in his home with the help of sexy prostitute Rebecca De Mornay. A very entertaining movie...has some dated moments but the music, and performances by Cruise and DeMornay make that a non factor."
2,Occasionally amusing but dated,"The young Tom Cruise stars in this fantasy about a teenager in the Chicago suburbs setting up a temporary brothel in his home when his parents take a few days in Florida. Cruise is fine and gets to do an air guitar dance in his underwear -- but the movie seems awfully dated. Rebecca de Mornay is the young whore with a heart of gold. There's a cute car chase and a nice scene with Dad's Porsche going into Lake Michigan but much of the rest is slightly yucky. This movie came out when the big AIDS explosion was taking place -- but you'd never guess from watching this. Some of the interplay between Cruise and his parents recalls The Graduate but without the bite of that classic. There is also a character called Guido, a mafiosi type who seems like an incredibly gentle gangster to audiences that have become familiar with the brutality of The Sopranos. (I think the same actor later met a grisly fate in that series)."
4,'Risky Business' (Warner Studios) Runiing time: 99 minutes,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came to the theaters on Labor Day weekend '83.Saw the flick with two of my elderly aunts.I mean,how tacky is that?Loved seeing/watching this sex comedy again and again.Straight A student Joel(Tom Cruise)tries to avoid his annoying friend's advise on how to 'get lucky' with a hot girl from the newspaper's personal ads.But Miles(Curtis Armstrong-we know him as Booger from 'Revenge Of The Nerds')won't easily give up until he gets Joel a woman.Several twists and situations occur before Joel meets his dream girl,Lana(Rebecca De Mornay)and gets his first lay(memorable scene,by the way).Joel,Miles and Lana later end up in a car chase scene being pursued by Guido,the killer pimp(Joe Pantoliano)who turns out to be Lana's pimp.Just watch the movie,you'll be glad you did.If you can believe it,I still run into people who've NEVER even scene this or several other 'Blockbuster' movies."
2,Great movie - Poor DVD,"I think most people who buy/rent this DVD have already seen the movie and know what they're getting. There are a lot of good reviews on this movie here at amazon.com but I only saw one that mentioned the quality of the DVD. It is absolutely horrible. The companies who produce these dark, grainy DVDs need to know that the consumers aren't going to accept this type of low-quality transfer. I'd gladly pay a bit more money for a DVD that's viewable. We know how good movies can look on DVD. So why release a disc that looks as poor as this one? As consumers we need to demand better! Just as VHS movies recorded in SLP or EP were unacceptable, so are DVDs that look as bad as this Risky Business disc."
2,Rip Off! Digital Copy Expired as of 10/16/09,"The transfer is bad. The digital copy has expired by 10/16/09(Thank you Warner Bros) Audio commentary by filmmakers conflicts with feature audio countless times and cannot be isolated. Warner Bros is engaging in decietful, misleading and disingenuous tactics to make a profit and won't budge on expiration date extension (but what else is new). Why put an expiration on a digital download? Afraid some of your content might exist online long enough for some devout Risky Business ""hacker"" to acquire the film for free? (what a risky venture digital copy thing is. Poor WB)"
3,"80,s movie","A somewhat dark 80,s teenage movie, the mood is seroius,very coming of age,unlikeother films, from same time period,(Sixteen Candles).etc,somewhat haunting musicis played off and on through the movie,but fits the style of the show,pretty goodchase scene with a Porsche 928,if your a fan of 80,s sports cars,very goodperformance,s by a young Tom Cruise,and co-stars."
5,Ida,this book is about a family that a lady came to named Ida I rated thisnbook 10 if you wanted to no. It was a funny bookit was also exciting. the morel to the story is to bo your self this book is good for anybudy because it mackes you want to turn the pag. was
3,Ida Early is not as far fetched as it sounds!,This is a humor packed book with some sad parts. It teaches us good values like don't judge a book by it's cover. True friends help friends through rough patches.
3,ida early comes over the mountain,ida early a person whow comes to the Sottens house. She wanted to work for the Sottens. Ida said she would clean and cook for some money. Mr. Sotten said he could not pay her much money. Later in the book Clay made a club. At the end ida makes a hard decision.
3,required purchase,I had to get this for school. It seems to serve its purpose. I got it used and it is in good condition and still had the cd with it
5,Statistics informed decisions using data,"One of the BEST books on using data to produced statistically based decisions. Book takes you through the nuances of this procedure,and makes sure that you avoid the pitfalls of bad science."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM HIM!,"Very disappointed with this seller. He did not inform me that he sold the book I purchased to another person until I contacted him, a month after I purchased it. I strongly reccommend not to buy any product from this person even though it may be cheaper than other items."
1,contrived examples,"amazon rejected my first review of this book.i am guessing that i used some bad language to describe how bad i think this book is.the examples are contrived and silly.i found the writing style pedantic.i promise i won't use the word ""drivel"" in any more reviews!"
1,dvd purchase,"Very dissapointed in item. The case of dvd (The Man with the Golden Gun) was broken. As this was a gift, it was huge disappointment to give it in that condition. The case obviously did not break in shipping, it was clearly box ed that way prior to shipping. Thank you for asking my opinion."
3,Bad Burn! (part 2),"Like someone mentioned in a January 2012 review, I also received a bad burn copy. The pixels all over the 2nd half of the movie. Very frustrating.Reading that review made me feel somewhat better knowing that I wasn't the only one out there who got the *one* bad copy. There must be countless bad ones floating around & MGM or whoever makes/distributes the dvds should really look into the problem.I'd like to buy it again, but I'm avoiding the ""Special Edition"" version. So should you. Gonna try the ""Ultimate"" version next."
4,Fix for DVD Problem!,"Call 1-800-MGM4YOU to find out how to get this DVD replaced if it doesn't work for you. Apparently MGM has had a lot of problems. They just asked for my name and address, emailed me a prepaid UPS shipping label in PDF format, and said that my replacement disk would be here in 4-6 weeks."
1,Golden Dud,"The 007 series continued its downhill slide in ""Man With the Golden Gun."" Once again, Roger Moore sleepwalks through the proceedings, which gives Christopher Lee carte blanche in terms of scene stealing. The film starts promisingly, then plummets to absurd depths. Not as bad as ""View to a Kill,"" but pretty close."
3,GOOD BLU RAY TRANSFER,I have to say I was very impressed with the image transfer on this movie. It feels like watching a new movie all over again. The scenery and detail are stunning. Not the best Bond movie but certainly held my interest whenever I saw Maud Adams.
3,Hold The Pepper,"This one holds up pretty well and would be a solid series entry if it weren't for the reappearance of the J.W. Pepper comic relief leftover from L&LD. As always, great extras."

1,The Worst?,"In its day, this was considered the worst Bond movie of all time. But we hadn't yet seen ""Moonraker,"" ""A View to a Kill,"" ""License to Kill,"" or Pierce Brosnan. And we hadn't taken a look back at the truly awful ""Live and Let Die."" So maybe it's not the worst. But there's certainly no reason to sit through it, either."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Easily one of the weakest Bonds, The Man with the Golden Gun features a terrible sidekick, a boring villain whose only desire seems to be killing Bond (not any lofty or megalomaniacal goal), a dumb conclusion, dumb women and the sorely-unanticipated return of J.W. Pepper: pick almost any other outing by any of the actors instead of this turkey."
3,An ok Bond film after Live and Let Die,"I do like some of the locations where the film was shot. However, some flaws. Roger Moore looks like he started to age and the bond girls were quite boring and not as sexy as the others. Christopher Lee plays the a good villian and the little short guy which I cannot remember his name is out of place in film. Also, the bond car is AMC!!! No special effects or gadgets? What Happened??? Otherwise, the soundtrack is groovy and was starting the Disco Bond years with Roger Moore. Three stars is good enough."
4,Good job Roger Moore,"I really enjoyed The Man With The Golden Gun.It has a great villain named Scaramanga.(the title charactor)It features very blond(and very beautiful!) Bond girl Mary Goodnight,who assists Bond,and a beautiful woman named Andrea Anders,who is Scaramanga's mistress and eventually betrays him.It also features a midget named Nick Nack who is Scaramanga's servant.(I don't like to call him a henchman,he just doesn't seem large enough!)The theme song,sung by Lulu is very catchy.Overall it's a very good Roger Moore Bond film,just not his best.(my personal favorite of Moore's is The Spy Who Loved Me)Anyway,how can a person not like a movie that has a flying AMC Matador!"
4,Man with the Golden Gun,I received this DVD for Christmas. At 1:20:00 the disc locks up. I later rented a copy from the video store and it too locked up at the exact same spot. The DVD of this film appears to be deffective. The movie is great so long as you have a working DVD.
4,THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN,This film is not one of the best of the Bond films. It scores points because of the villian Scarmanga and his small henchman. It has great locations and great fight scences. I love the duel between Bond and Scarmanga. This is a pretty good Bond film.
3,An ok James Bond film.,"I just saw the actual DVD with the plastic wrapped around it, and wanted to buy the DVD tonight, but couldn't due to not being the street date. The film will be in Stereo Surround 2.0, Dolby Prologic I believe that is. It didn't say anything of Mono Sound. The plot was interesting, but at times not enough action. Roger Moore practically sleep walks through the entire film. I think an excellent scene that makes the film stand out is when James Bond gets help from two oriental neices who demonstrate brilliant martial art skills on a school of martial art students who are trying to go after 007 while he is escaping from the kung fu school in Thailand. A good car chase scene is added, also the showdown of Christopher Lee and 007 on the island. I can't wait to see the DVD version. This film though does not equal up to Moore's later ones or even Live and Let Die."
3,There's Nothing Like A Good Duel,"The Man With The Golden Gun may not be a classic Bond film, but it holds it's own. Forget about the Solex Agitator, this film is about Scaramanga vs. Bond. Great performances by Lee, Moore, and Villachaize highlight this film. If you don't laugh when Moore kicks a Karate Student in the face during his bow, check your pulse. J.W. Pepper has his moments, but the weak Britt Ekland hurts the film. For the guy who said Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies were great Bond films, slap yourself."
2,An un-gentleman James Bond twist,"Roger Moore stepped into the James Bond left behind from Sean with my martini is still dry.Do we expect a Royal British secret agent to act as a gentleman not a disgrace of Her Majestic Secret Service?How can a British gentleman well dressed and well manner in a fight with the dwarf make a sneak attack while bowing? It is not ethical to violate a fair duet. This kind of action is not acceptable in American, British and Asian cultures!The Thailand seashore is beautiful but the story is funny and degenerated into a moving cartoon.Most likely, M did not approve this Bond mission of golden gun."
2,Extremely Flawed,"I liked Christopher Lee as the villain, but everything else is wrong. The girls are wrong, the jokes are bad and I couldn't stand Nick Nack, the most annoying baddie henchmen to date."
1,really?!,"Yes I own this turkey, do I think it's a good Bond movie. A BIG NO!!!!!, not even Christopher Lee could save this movie. Bond has been targeted by an assassin who uses a golden gun, but wait he's stolen the solex agitator energy converter. So Bond must go after him, this movie bogs itself down. From being imprisoned in a karate school, then trying to escape using the ""Judo chop"". An inside joke, to Bond and Scaramanga scareing off in a duel of pistols in a fun house. This movie is better than Moonraker, but not by much, I consider this one and Moonraker to be Moore's worst outings as Bond."
1,TERRIBLE!,This is by far the worst entry in the series. The problem lies with the movie itself. The film is just so boring. The chases are pointless. The two very small high points are the scene where Bond and Scarmanga are back to back with their guns and Moore as Bond. Otherwise absolutlely terrible!
3,Fun Bonding!,"One of my favorite Bond movies! This has less of the Roger Moore ""camp"" we will see in his later efforts! The movie locations are great and Lee makes a nice villian! Clifton James as sheriff J.W. Pepper and his car chase with Bond is a hoot! Only gripe is the extras! Some crummy, short documentary on stunt driving and outtake of Moore in Hong Kong locale is all there is! I was hoping for a 45 min documentary on the making of movie. A short documentary on Guy Hamilton is nice at least! Only 3 stars as result! Movie gets 5!"
4,The man with the golden gun (special edition),"James bond movies are not great movies, but good entertainment. I like when comedy is associated with this kind of movies. The violence is always the least I like, but it is a part of all James Bond movies and it is on the fantasy side, so it is okay I guess.Roger Moore is the best James Bond for me, because he is funny at times."
2,My least favorite Bond,"I know everyone seems to think Moonraker is Bond's worst movie, but I dislike this one more. I didn't like the villain and thought the whole gun chase through the house of mirrors, etc., was just plain stupid. I only bought this one to make my blu-ray Bond set complete."
3,A little slow and silly,"I think this one had kind of a slow build-up and then when it gets going, things are a little silly with the schoolgirls and Sheriff Pepper part deux. Meh."
4,This movie is so cool. It is my favorite in the whole series,This movie is so exciting. I can't see how so many people hate it. It is my favorite in the series.It is filled with action with plenty of funny parts.I love it.
2,Watch this when None of the Bond Movies are available,"One of the worst Movies of the series. A Very thin plot. And what is this ? Frustrated with the situation 'M' asks 'Q' to shut up and 'Q' lets 'M' go without a return remark. A truly hilarious moment is when Bond does a one-kick knockout during a Martial Arts fight. Nick Nack is very annoyable most of the times. Christopher Lee could not give right justice to the character of Fransisco Scaramanga. He was never that chilling. The broken bridge jump was good but was ruined by the terrible Sound effect. The Golden Gun which could be folded into a lighter was a good weapon , a perfect match to the Walther PPK though. The giant maze created by Scaramanga is quite good but there's nothing in this movie which can be enjoyed by a Bond fan. Neither there is enough suspense nor there is enough action. Don't bother if you haven't bought or rented this one. You can consider yourself lucky."
4,The Best Bond Ending Ever,"Roger Moore is back (sigh) as James Bond, agent 007 of Her Majesty's Secret Service. This time he is chasing Scaramanga, a deadly assassain, played very well by Christopher Lee. Bond himself, however, is weak, and Moore struggles. But the movie is still pretty good. Bond chases Scaramanga around Asia until the final confrontation on his small island. The ending is the best ever in a Bond movie, the story is pretty good, although a little thin, this is a movie that is a good Bond experience, but not on par with Moore's later movies, namely Octopussy and The Spy Who Loved Me. The other things I did not like were the annoying sheriff near the end and the Bond girl. Worth checking out if you are a Bond fan."
2,Bond no.9,"Roger Moore's second outing as the debionare Jame Bond falls far short of the classic Bond films that fans have come to love, with Man with the Golden Gun being one of the weakest in the franchise. The film does have some good points; some good action scenes, impressive locations and Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. But the car chases and other action set-pieces feel laboured and not up to par with the extravegant likes of Diamonds are Forever (1971) or Live and Let Die (1973). Still, it's Bond, and fans love it. The more discerning however will no doubt pass on this one."
1,007 Fires Blanks,"Redneck comic relief, lackluster villains and a title song by Lulu! This is James Bond? ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" (1974) remains one of the dullest 007 adventures, with Roger Moore as a lightweight Bond. There is a terrific car stunt, but that's about it. Not surprisingly, this was the least successful 007 film in terms of box-office earnings."
2,This film was waiting to (...).......no Moore!!!!!!!!!,"I love James Bond films but I was not enthusiastic about The Man with The Golden Gun. The film centers around Scaramanga, a hit man who uses million dollar bullets to kill his enemies. The script needed work and I found there to be very little fight scenes in this film. Goodnight, Bond's female companion, represented absolute stupidity like the script, especially during the closet scene. The golden gun looked like a piece of cardboard sprayed with golden spraypaint and the car scene,....well I need not say anymore. Roger Moore in my opinion lacks the smoothness and coolness of Sean Connery. What happened to the dry martini..shaken not stirred? If you like cheesy kung - fu scenes, rednecks in rivers, naive women, grown men suckering young boys and Fantasy Island's ""Tattoo"" all bundled into unforgettable package of nonsense, then this is a must see movie for you."
2,"Yes, there is a defect, but....","As many of you know, the DVD is defective starting at Chapter 21, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy this DVD.What the defect appears to be is simply bad encoding: the colors scramble, the audio becomes skippy and garbled.PS2 can recover from the defect with nothing more than a slight hesitation where the defect first occurs. My DVD-ROM on my computer recovered from the defect after about 1 minute of play time, but my stand-alone DVD player never recovered, leaving the rest of the movie messed-up and totally worthless.I hope this will help someone who wants the movie but has heard about the defect. It really depends on the ability of your DVD player/software as to how bad the defect will come across."
5,One of the best Bond films,"Ignore the disparaging comments and enjoy an extremely well-made, entertaining film that was a worthy successor to Live And Let Die. The much-underrated Roger Moore is ideal as Bond, accurately portraying Flemming's character as charming but ruthless with a highly developed sense of social superiority -something that the revered Connery never quite managed. Christopher Lee is equally impressive as Scaramanga, the assassin who could be said to represent the dark side of Bond. Overall, an excellent movie."
1,Golden Dud,"The DVD version - or least the two seperate copies that I have come across - have some sort of encryption error from the middle of Scene 21 onwards to the end (right where Bond drives through the car dealership's showroom window in the AMC Hornet).The video on the DVD appears blank black and the the audio track is severely clipped.I do not know if this applies to all copies made, but it certain does to the both that I have tried to view. I have tried to contact MGM as well to no avail to see if they can replace these badly-pressed DVDs. An awful Bond movie made worse by the fact that I cannot actually watch it... you have been warned!ADDED LATER - MGM eventually issued replacement copies if you contacted them through their website."
1,The worst Bond ever,"If Amazon hadn't forced me to, I would have given this film 0 stars! Big fat 0! This has got to be the worst Bond film ever. The only good thing about it is Christopher Lee as Francisco Scaramanga, one of the best Bond villains.But Herve Villechaize is fairly annoying as the midget henchman Knick Knack. Sheriff J.W. Pepper is back, and he isn't funny (it's best to remember him from LALD). That car stunt with the barrell roll was cool, but ruined by the worst sound effect in the movie. The action isn't good. James Bond doing Kung fu? The gadget master Q doesn't work his magic (r.i.p Desmond). The titles are bad, the title song is nauseating, and the girls are nothing but annoying.If you are a die hard fan get it, otherwise....BEWARE!"
1,"Terrible Bond Film, But Great DVD","""The Man With The Golden Gun"" is the worst film in the James Bond series. Its characters are weak, its humor, corny, and the production values are simply bellow Bond standards. The main problem with it is that the story is uninteresting. Even though the villainous title character (Christopher Lee) is one of the few genuine attractions, everything around him seems to be out of place, or just plain ludicrous. It's a shame that the few good bits get ruined by something uninspired. The amazing car stunt over the bridge is scored badly, John Barry's music is only good in parts, and Maud Adams, a beautiful and interesting character, gets killed off just when we start to like her. However, I should point out that the DVD for the film is very well made and includes two very interesting documentaries: one on the making of the film, the other on the stuntmen behind the film series. Add two stars just for the DVD bonuses."
3,HAD PROBLEMS WITH DVD ON MY RCA,Like Jeff (the reviewer who had problems with this DVD). I also had problems with this DVD on my RCA DVD player and my PC DVD player. A friend who borrowed also had problems on his Apex DVD player. Unlike him I went through four different discs hoping it was a disc. The only reason that I am writing this is I wanted to let Jeff know that he is right about the disc. Thank you.
2,Does not work with xbox dvd playback kit,Do not get this if all you got for a dvd player is an xbox dvd playback kit. Once it gets to scene 22 the picture turns green and blocky.It was a good movie but only buy it if you have a different dvd player than Xbox.
2,No menace..............,"Even if this is far form the best Bond,every Bond-fan can`t help liking it,even if they think it`s the worst.It has two outstanding villains(Villechaize and Lee),but the plot doesn`t really work,and Britt Ekland is the worst Bond bird ever.One of the worser Bonds,but worth seeing and very enjoyable."
4,Not to bad.Not near as bad as people would make it look like,"THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is a great STORY bond. There is some action parts, but there watered down. Roger is great once again, and the bond ladies are hott and sexy, but the ONLY reason this movie gets more than 2 stars is CHRISTOPHER LEE. WOW!! He is in the top 3 greatest villins of all time. I beleave it the director would have just let Bond and Scaramanga duke it out all over the world, and let the ""finding the Solex"" [stuff] go out the window, this movie would own even more. Also the part with the sherrif comin back into the movie from Live and Let Die was also unessicary. But one of the better bonds to say the least."
3,Nowhere close to the Sean Connery classics,"""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is better than ""Live and Let Die"" but nowhere close to the Sean Connery classics. Roger Moore lacks Connery's grit and magnetism. The Bond girls in this movie are not nearly as curvy or sexy as the Connery girls. But this movie does have good characters, settings, and action sequences. Tattoo from ""Fantasy Island"" plays sidekick villain Nick Nack. Bond goes to Hong Kong and Thailand, and briefly goes up against some martial artists. As always, your best bet is to watch the Sean Connery films, but this is okay once you've exhausted those. The movie is now out on Blu-ray, and looks very sharp, bright, and clean. Reviewed 5/17/2009 after watching on Blu-ray."
2,Just okay,"Difficult reading for the layman, but informative. There are plenty of other better books in print on this subject."
5,Very nice!,I bought this on sale and wish I would of purchased more at the time. It is really a great light.
1,another one with rain damage,"after a few days of rain, the moisture have gotten trapped inside the sensor. Now it doesn't turn on. I'm looking for a new light, or a new sensor to swap in."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"THIS ITEM IS CRAP!!!!BUY A LIGHT FROM HOME DEPOT SO AT LEAST YOU CAN RETURN IT EASY IF IT IS JUNK LIKE THIS ITEM!! LIGHT DOES NOT TURN OFF....STAYS ON AND THE ONLY WAY TO TURN IT OFF IS BY THE SWITCH INSIDE THE HOUSE!! KIND OF DEFEATS THE ""SENOR"" YA THINK!! I WISH I HAD NOT HAVE THROWN THE BOX AWAY SO SOON, SINCE I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD NOT WORK AT ALL I TOSSED IT....NOW THE ONLY SATISFACTION IS TOSSING THIS ITEM AND GETTING A REAL LIGHT!!!!!WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE GIVEN IT A STAR!!!"
1,Scoring motion light,"Installed this light per instuction inside my garage out of the weather. Light worked fine for about a week but then stayed on all the time. Went through all the fix it items in the instruction sheet but nothing worked, the light stayed on all the time no matter what I tried. So it is being replaced with a standard light. Not happy with the whole thing."
2,"Enough about Michelle, what about Jeff???","Yes, Michelle P. seems to be every man's fantasy, but for me, a female, check out the way Jeff seduces her by the piano! I met Jeff B. and he must be 6'4""...and sexy. The music tops it all off...Grusin, good job."
5,"Intelligent, original, fresh, and completely believable","Stave Kloves is quite a writer. He manages to create very believable, three-dimensional characters who are free of cliches. Luckily, he gets great performances out of the actors playing those characters, too. This movie introduces people you don't normally see or hear about--those hungry entertainers on the fringes of show business who don't always have the luxury of saying no to a gig. This is also a love story about people who don't know how to let their guard down and suffer accordingly. Somehow it manages to be very funny, too. One of the most underrated films I've seen in years."
2,SLOW AND BORING - DISAPPOINTING MOVIE,"I've heard about THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS through the years. I know it got Michelle Pfeiffer a lot of attention. It's fun to see a young Pfeiffer along with a young Jeff and Beau Bridges. I expected so much more from a film with such a great cast.I found it tediously slow moving and incredibly predictable.Jack and Frank Baker are a brother piano playing duo in lounges. They are from an older time and business is not good. Time for a sexy singer to join thr group. Here is a brief bit of fun as a wide away of bad and goofy female singers audition--and all that 80's hair! Late arrival Susie (Pfeiffer) wins them over. No surprise that Jack and Susie's chemistry causes friction with Frank. Hey, what else is going to happen.I don't know if Pfeiffer did the actual singing but she sure exudes sexual wildness on stage. I know this film has a lot of fans but unfortunately, I am not one of them."
3,Doesn't sizzle as much now.,"The Fabulous Baker Boys starring Jeff and Beau Bridges is somewhat dated now but thanks to Michelle Pfeiffer - she owns this film with her sex appeal. I have always been a huge fan of Pfeiffer, not only can she sing, she is an incredible actress. The love triangle is the best part of the film but overall I kinda lost interest over the years with this movie."
5,Just great in all aspect ...,"This film is a great film. Not just the story, but the thing I like the most is how each character is described throughout the film. I would highly recommend this to everyone ..."
3,"not enough time of use, but so far so good",This product requires much more time to notice any good effects. On the other hand there have been no noticable BAD effects. So thus the three star so far so good rating.
5,Astaxanthin softgels,I was told by my wholistic nutritionist to take this because it is good for many things! I've been taking it for a few months. Not sure what it is doing but I feel great!
2,"unsure about this,","but I believe I have a strange reaction of dizziness when I take it, so I was not able to give it a fair evaluation since I stopped using this product."
3,Not so great,"My experience with this product is mixed. They cleaned fingerprint marks from the glass OK but I was disappointed that white fuzz was left behind after cleaning. The packaging is convenient, but plan to use the wipes before they dry out. The manufacturer claims they will remain fresh for at least a year. Next time I'll use a spray-on cleaner and save some money."
2,i didnt like the movie,i Thought the movie left out alot of detail from the book. i would recommend if you wanted to know the story you should read the novel
5,Good one!,"Our family watched this movie on TV when our daughter was very small and recently bought it to add to our collection. It is a very interesting and informative film. It is suspenseful, but not too much for young children. Don't miss it."
3,A good story!,"A little cheesy for what movies are nowadays, couldn't expect anything more for it's era and it was a great family movie. My 9 & 7 year old daughters loved it. It you have ever read the book, it leaves a lot out and pales in comparison. Wish someone would remake this movie and make it current. A nice 3 hour long plus version with technology available now, a little CGI, then we'd be talking a movie."
5,You Taught Me How to Love You in an Old Hawaiian Way,"One of Hawaii's most beloved musicians and composers, the late Auntie Irmgard Keali`iwahinealohanohokahaopuamana Farden `Aluli was born in Pu`unoa, Mala, Lahaina (Maui) on October 7, 1911.The ninth child of thirteen, her roots extended as she grew and took a firm hold in family life, music, education and religion -- composing songs which have become ""classics"" in Hawaiian music. She dazzled and amazed her fans for six decades. On FROM IRMGARD WITH LOVE, she is joined by her group Puamana.This CD won the 1999 Na Hoku Hanohano Awards for Anthology Album of the Year from the Hawai`i Academy of Recording Arts."
2,Slow with my camera,"I bought this for my casio digital camera given the great price. I figured an SD card is an SD card. Problem is, compared to my San Disk or Cannon cards, when it is loaded into my camera, there is a significant and annoying wait between taking pictures. As a consequence, it has been relegated to the backup disk to my 256MB card. I haven't bought a PNY product since, bc rather than a bargain, this brand may be a ""get what you pay for"" thing."
5,SD Card the greatest,"Very pleased with SD card and its delivery to my address. No hitches, no glitches, everything about the transaction was great."
1,pny 512M,I purchased one of these units at Walmart. Neither my eMachine nor my HP Pavillion will recognize it.
3,It's supposed to be oldschool...,"A music fan from Vancouver wrote a reveiw and said ""Good overall... Too much oldschool"". The title is ""Freeestyle Legends"" Legends.The mega mix is ok, but over all the cd is average. The Version of ""Fantasy girl"" on this cd is the worst version of the song. My only real problem was that some really great freestyle songs were left off the album.If your like me and have to have every cd to round out your collection, than get it. It's not a bad Cd at all. But If you only have $15 and it comes down to this and another freestyle compilation, take a good look at the playlists and go with the one with more of your favorites.I give it 3 stars of out 5."
2,Good overall... Too much oldschool.,Let's put the oldschool freestyle aside. Bring in some new stuff. We've heard Tolga and Nice and Wild too many times. Get in that studio and come up with new and better freestyle.
3,"Cool show, but 1080i is not ideal.","So first of all, this is a pretty good science show. It's no Cosmos, but Mike Rowe has a good voice and the show presents the material well.There's really just one big problem here, and that's that the show is in 1080i video. As someone who likes to backup his movies to a computer to stream to the TV, I am troubled by 1080i video due to the lack of open-source codecs for it. There also isn't a lot of complex/fast motion in this type of show, so there's really no reason for it to not be presented in 1080p."
3,How the Universe Works,Will complete this one later. It has many good points and glad I have it. Reminds me a lot of what I watch on Cable PBS. Please send the review to me again to finish. Thank you!! Lavon Sutherland
3,"Irritating Dramatic Format but, with Great Visuals and Information","Too bad about the obnoxious ""dramatic"" way the information is presented in a manner similar to those awful reality tv programs --everything loud and dramatic and is repeated over and over and over. But, it's what one would expect from Discovery. If you can tolerate all that, I'd recommend watching it, because the information and visuals are really good."
3,"Interesting, but a little overdone.","Great visuals, and interesting explanations. Unfortunately, the background was too loud sometimes and made the scientists difficult to understand. I'll watch the other episodes, for sure, but will constantly play with the volume control."
4,How the Universe Works,"Excellent video. The package was a little torn up. The video itself was worth 5 stars. The information is mind-blowing, coming from the ""old school"" of information."
4,An engaging look at the Cosmos,"Does looking at the night sky give you a feeling of awe? Do you feel part of what you see there? This series proceeds from the Big Bang, to stars, to planets, to moons, to novas, and never leaves that magic feeling of being part of the stardust."
5,Great for toddlers and parents!,My toddler (2.5 yrs) and I love to watch this together for 15 or 20 minutes in the evenings to settle her down before starting her bedtime routine. The brilliant colors keep her entertained and I learn facinating new things each time. If she keeps an interest we have decided to have her 5th birthday at a planetarium!
5,Dark hole,One thing about this i know how dark work but didnt know what make the dark hole but after i saw it enjoy more about knowing more thing everything about dark hole great info its was good
5,Excellent Commentaries and Graphics... Definitely Recommended!,This is an excellent dvd set (2 discs). I recommend it to anyone interested in physics and/or astronomy. It presents great images and commentaries by leading physicists. The script is not too technical for those unversed in physics but it is rigorous enough for those who are.
5,"Truly, truly outstanding","This series blew my mind. I loved it even more than Carl Sagan's Cosmos. The graphics are stunning and the narration is terrific and most episodes I realized my mouth was hanging agape. The cosmic physics are presented in a way that just about anyone can understand, and those with more life experience will marvel at the wonder of the interconnectedness and conditional existence of our reality. I loved it. The music could be a bit over-dramatic, but understandable given how dramatic the information really is. And I really liked the sound effects. Super high-quality experience that left me on an emotional and intellectual high."
5,How the universe works by Mike Rowe,I bought this dvd for my grandson who loves to study about the universe & what makes it tick. He was very pleased with this dvd and told me he has enjoyed it greatly. And I was very happy I got it before xmas. Thank you.
1,Awful manufacturing,"I have bought my second copy of this show. The first one skipped and jumped and this one does as well. I'm very disappointed. Amazon was great about exchanging the first one. Now, just have to return the second."
4,Sound quality does not work but everything else does.,"This is a great series. All eight episodes are mind-blowing and have changed my perspective on life, the universe and everything. The ONLY thing that is bad is the sound quality. At times the sound drifts in and out making you have to adjust the sound from the TV or home theater system. I first saw this on NETFLIX and there was the same problem. Mike Rowe is great as usual making making it easy to see how the universe works."
4,WONDERFUL STYLE,THESE BOOTS ARE SO CUTE. THEY FIT WELL SEEM TO BE WARM. MOST OF ALL MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER KC LIKES THEM.
4,Classic,"This book is a classic. I constantly used a colleague's copy for the longest time. Finally I decided to get my own. It is a must have for anybody working on frequency synthesizers. But this is not what makes it great, it is the additional information that the author adds. Shielding effectiveness, control isolation. Topics which are essential to low noise synthesizer designs, but are normally not included in text books. Many of these are things that one only picks up through experience, empirically, and they are presented here well organized and easy to follow. Another author that I also like, because of similar style and constant addition of this type of hard-to-find data is Randy Rhea."
5,Getting Back To Nature Is Fun!!!,"As a reader from Upstate New York (where winters are very cold and where thoughts of ""Sex In The Woods"" keep us warm)I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Colombo's entertaining book. The reader from Pacific NW really missed the point of the whole book. It's not to be read as a manual, but rather a light hearted (tongue-in-cheek) book that certainly offers good advice on a subject most of us are interested in, but also keeps you amused along the way. My thanks to the author for sharing some great ways to rev up a tired sex life!!!! We're off to the woods next weekend!"
4,A thoroughly enjoyable read,"A friend told me about this book. It manages to be both interesting and informative and provides a wealth of useful information--like the ABCs of romantic dining al fresco, what to pack in your safe sex first aid kit, and how to protect yourself from bugs without poisoning your partner--while keeping the tone lighthearted and sexy. Can't wait to try out some of this stuff on my next camping trip."
3,"Fun, but probably won't utilize","Since the two of us our avid wilderness campers I thought this would be an important book for us. It caught our eye at the bookstore and we new we had to have it.For the most part the book contained little that we had not already known. There is no doubt some good practical ideas are brought up. For the die hard ""rough it"" camper the book is more for entertainment. It is a fun book. For the occasional Jellystone camper one should find it more pertinent. Although the book is meant for the outdoorsmen miles from home, we find that time restraints would forgo its use."
5,Wow!,"The best rally game ever, Colin McRae Rally, has just been beaten. Colin McRae Rally 2.0 is remarkable in its realistic driving conditions, scenery, road conditions, weather, AI, car damage....the list goes on and on. It's unbelievable how much realism they put in this game and how well it runs on minimal requirements. I have a Voodoo2 and a 300 mhz Pentium II, which doesn't really meet the playing requirements of most modern games, but CMR2 runs almost perfectly on my machine. I'm going to upgrade to a Voodoo5 just to make this game even better!Codemasters has really figured out how to make the best racing games. I wish EA would learn a few things from them."
5,"A good, fun movie","I count this movie as being one of my favorite comedies, being right up there with The Three Amigos. I agree with the other reviewers who state that most people thought this was going to be in the vein of 'Die Hard'. I am an avid Bruce Willis fan and this film reminded me of his days on Moonlighting. A good plot, great music and a LOT of irreverence! I would recommend this to anyone with a mature sense on humor and at least 1/2 of a brain."
1,Past It's Sell By Date,"Well, where do I start? Bruce Willis was great in Moonlighting and Die Hard, Andie MacDowell was great in a number of films: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Green Card, Ground Hog Day and others.Unfortunately, Hudson Hawk was thoroughly disappointing. Some 21 years since it's release and the film's story line, writing and acting has not aged well. Bruce comes off as a buffoon who can't act and the story line is just plain awful.Truly one of the worst films I've watched in ages.If you're trying to decide if this movie is for you, at least borrow it from your local library. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this. Better yet, go for a walk, you'll get much more satisfaction from a stroll in the sunshine instead of watching this travesty of acting."
5,A great good time movie,"Regardless of what others have said about the film, it was great. Personaly I do not let critics choose what kind of movie I will like. And if you like comedy and satire then this is the movie for you. It's off the wall, light hearted, and boasts a great soundtrack. I would have to rate this as the most I have laughed at a movie in a long time and this movie is not brand new either. Plus it has Bruce Willis, and you can't go wrong with that."
1,YOU CAN SEE THE JOKES COMING A MILE AWAY ZZZzzzzzzzzZZzzzzz!,"My friend felt I needed to see this film, so he lent it to me. I had never seen it before and after 15 minutes I was telling my wife who was watching with me, what was about to happen next. The jokes are so old and tired I couldn't believe they were using them! I would rather watch the Three Stooges(Not that there is anything wrong with that!)At least the Stooges are really old classic shorts that were making history. The comparison to the Stooges is that the jokes in this movies are as old as the jokes in the Stooges shorts. This movie just isn't very good and isn't very funny unless you think a person slipping on a banana peel or a pie in the face is funny?...HEE HEE HEE HAW HAW!!!"
1,"Pass this one up... Silly, not funny",I was really bored watching this movie and actually fell asleep toward the end. I agree with the majority out there that thinks this movie is one of the worse of all time. I just wish I can recover the hour and forty minutes of my life that I wasted watching this film.
1,boring,bruce willis is in my top 5 actors but this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life...simple as that...
1,Silly And Forgettable,"I saw this movie when it first was released, and just didn't care for it. I'm sure there are certain people that like this, but I just thought it was totally silly and not any good. Not recommended."
4,Great movie,"Well, don't ever believe the critics. I find when they write bad reviews that's when you got to go see the movie. I'm a big Bruce Willis fan but don't rave about all his movies. This movie was VERY entertaining and a good sing-a-long. I now have the soundtrack so I can sing to it in my car.It's worth the money to buy this one."
3,Stealing from Vatican,"An ex-convict can't escape his crime past to run a NY pub business freely. His criminal expertise had taken him involuntarily to Vatican where a Hoboken-risen professional made a day.Murdering, killing, satire with no positive feeling generated to any character screened."
2,boo,"this was such a weird movie. there were definitely funny parts: kind of like monty python, but significantly more weird."
3,All he wanted was a simple cappuchino!,It is an okay movie. Definitely not a family show. The language is really bad. It did have some funny parts though. The camaraderie between the main two characters keeps you rolling. One man just wanted a cappuchino and another just wanted to rule the world.
4,"Fun, Stupid & Easy","Hawk, is almost the perfect video movie. If you have an hour and a half to kill, then this cassette is ideal. The primary reason that this film is such a classic is the enjoyment of watching all the performers (Willis, Aiello, McDowell, Grant, Bernhardt and so on) having an absolute blast. The film is certainly over the top, but it never takes it self itself seriously and the viewing of it shouldn't be taken seriously either. It ain't Shakespeare, but mindless entertainment, every now and then, is a healthy thing don't you think?"
4,One of my Favorite Movies,"Yes, this movie is ridiculous, and it's supposed to be! I have always found it to be a lighthearted dark comedy with repeat watching appeal. :)If you're looking for anything serious, or that takes itself seriously, this isn't for you. Otherwise I guarantee you will chuckle more than once at the Hawk's quest for a cappucino. ;)"
5,Hudson Hawk,I love this movie! It is absolutely hilarious and it's Bruce Willis at his finest. If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend getting it!
4,modern screwball crime caper,"I went to the theater to see this when it opened. My buddy and I laughed out loud. We figured it was going to be a hit. The local city newspaper review like it too. Then all the negative reviews and publicity started. In the weekend newspaper insert a negative mini-review was substituted for the positive review. The rest is history, but I am fond of this flick and I hope the powers that be will issue a blu-ray edition some day soon."
1,Indulge a Movie Star and This is What Happens,"Just like Eddie Murphy, Sylvester Stallone and Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis had a niche. It was specific and well-defined and it's name was ""Die Hard Movies."" Inside the niche he could do no wrong, but this success started him thinking he could do anything and succeed at anything because he was just so darned talented and charming. And Hollywood tends to indulge its successful stars and that's how we wind up in movie theaters with our mouths agape and thinking ""Oh no! It's not a dream; this is real and there's nothing I can do about it."" When Bruce Willis needed a friend, someone at the studio to sit him down and say ""Bruce, this script is a dog. Only one thing comes from dogs and that's exactly what the movie will be. Back away from this script and take a trip to Maui until your next Die Hard movie."" But, sadly, no one did say those things and be that friend to Mr. Willis. And we're stuck with the memory of this piece of dreck."
1,I really don't remember this movie,"but I was inspired by Jeff Bezos' review of The 13th Warrior to find all the movies I've seen over the years that have been indescribably dreadful. In fact, I am sure that the experience of watching it was just too excruciating and that I either walked out of the movie theater or threw my VHS player out the window in disgust. Hmm, which stinker will I look up next?"
5,It's all froth.,"Off the wall, funny, bizarre and surprisingly different, Hudson Hawk combines the best bits of Moonlighting with Die Hard action to create one of the best (and certainly most memorable) films that Bruce Willis has every made. I challenge you to watch it without humming Swingin on a Star for days afterwards!"
4,A movie that refuses to take itsself seriously!,"Hudson Hawk is one of those rare gems that comes out of Hollywood that I find completely hillarious because it refuses to act like a serious movie. I liken it to movies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Kuffs; they move quickly from scene to goofy scene with only a loose plot-line and one-liners to tie them together.If you're looking for a Oscar award-winning movie that redefines human nature and brings us all together into one peaceful nation, this is NOT it. But if you are looking for side-aching laughs, give this movie a try."
3,Not made to last,I received T-fal as a wedding gift. The marriage didn't last long and neither did this set. It performed great at first but the non-stick finish wore off. For better wear I suggest Cuisinart or Calphalon.
3,Good quality But poor design!,I bought this set thinking the lids to the pots would fit the skillets but they don't. This was really frustrating. The set has been great except for the lids.-Ryan
3,meh,"Only 1 year in and every pan is nonstick already. Just get good pans so you don't waste your money.Edit: Handle has fallen off of one of the pans more than once. It only requires you screw a bolt back in but still, its crappy workmanship."
3,why the price difference for colors??,why is the red $49 more then black for the exact thing?? You recieve exactly the same items for 4 different prices
3,T-Fail................,"This is very lovely cookware, and MUST be washed by hand, however, you also need to dry them immediately. If you don't dry them at once, they leave water spots and streaks. I should have done more research. I also wish I could have gotten the color I wanted. There wasn't a selection that I could choose from. Second, and LAST set of tfals, I will ever purchase."
2,"warning, red spots","look at the picture,notice the red spots? Whats going on??????When I'm cooking I don't like to see a big red circle in the middle of my food."
5,Cookware Review,"My daughter was moving, and needed her own kitchen items. We went to Amazon.com to view items. I saw this, and ordered it for her. It was delivered promptly. It was everything as promised.T-Fal Initiatives 10-Piece Nonstick Inside and Out"
5,Abolutely Wonderful for the Price,"You can't go wrong with this purchase. For $59.99 this set is truly a great buy. I like the pans because they are very easy to clean, and the handles do not get hot even after they have sat on a burner for sometime. Being very easy to clean is a major plus for me. I am very happy that I received this set as a gift. Also purchased a set for my MIL and she absolutely loves them."
4,pleased with the product,"My wife is largely pleased with this TFal set; it is an upgraded version of the one we replaced after 20 years of use. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the largest container came dented. I am not sure whether that was a TFAL, UPS or Amazon issue, but it is one of the hazards of ordering something like this online. I am not sure it was worth trying to remedy so we live with it."
5,very nice,"this includes all you'll need for a newlywed. good material, great price (i even got it in warehouse price!), you wont regret this buy!"
2,Didn't like it.,I unpacked everything and it was not as described. One of the frying pans is like a square skillet and the smallest pot is way too small to use for anything. I sent it back within the week.
2,T-fal initiatives,"Handles where loose and loosened after tightening. Large fry pan looks warped after one use and this was not on high heat. Bottom of the pans are very thin. Non stick yes, so far. Did not meet my expectations. Will have to disagree with the beter reviews. I believe in cookware you get what you pay for!!"
2,peels very easy,"i'm not sure why the quality in t-fal change , i used t-fal for years and this ones are not so good, the peel at the first month of use, i wash them by hand gentle and they start showing like spots, they are peeling from the screws, not happy with the brand"
4,Good set,"I really thought that the lids were interchangeable on all pots/frying pans. Sadly they are not. I had bought a JC Penny Cooks set about 5 years or so ago and the lids fit all the frying pans -- I really though this one would do the same. The frying pans are all shallower than what I am accustomed to as well. I am happy with the set, but must remove one start for incompatible lids for the frying pans."
5,Love them!!!!,I've had this pot set for a little while now and I must say I love them! They cook really well and I enjoy using them. No issues thus far.
5,Great,"Exactly what I was looking for...good quality at a good price, would definitely recommend to people looking for a set of pots and pans."
4,T-Fal and cleaning,"I love this set, truly nothing sticks to it EXCEPT whatever juices burns around the metal surface or bottom of the pan duing a spill over, this is the part that is not ""non-stick"" leaving my pots looking cheap and really really used! Still don't know how to get it off with out stratching the pots!"
4,Easy to Clean,"These live up to their name - very easy to clean... They're quite impressive that way...The largest pot takes FOREVER to get water to boil, though...I ended up switching pots back to my old one when it was about 25 minutes later and I noticed the water still wasn't boiling, yet...Oh, and if you stack your pans in the cabinet (which I do - I don't have a gigantic kitchen where I can lay out each pot and pan separately), the bottoms tend to get scratched up pretty easily......But other than that, they're worth the price..."
4,Good product...,Only thing I didn't like about the steamer didn't had any anti-scratch mechanism. it could scratch the Teflon coating.
4,Great Pans for the price,Purchased these for my Daughter for Christmas. Great first time set of pots and pans especially for the price. Could not find any descent set of pots and pans for any less.
2,a year later need a new set to replace,"I've had my set for about a year and I already feel I need to replace it, there is a lot of wear. I've had sets from Wal-Mart that lasted longer albeit they were a bit thinner but the nonstick coating held up better on those than on these. I don't like how bulky the handles are on the dutch oven, they take up a lot of room (width) in my dishwasher. Not to mention the scoop style handles are super weird. I was just hoping that although these are inexpensive they'd be a step up from buying the cheapest crap wal-mart sells but realistically they weren't any better at all. In fact the pots and pans these were to replace are still in my posession and heat more easily than these ones do."
2,coating is flaking off.,I've had the product for 6 months. I did not use metal utensils and the coating is flaking off. Now I have to go buy new pans. I wish I had the good experience some of the other users had. Oh well....
1,Bad luck with this set,"I don't know if I got a set that wasn't properly coated or what. Based on other reviews I thought this would be good cookware. I used the fry pan twice and the non-stick coating was extremely scratched and the coating coming off in several spots. I did not abuse it, I have a cheap [$$$] set of Mirro cookware I have used over 15 years before the coating finally started to come off. I sent this set back without bothering to try any of the other pans in the set. Very dissapointed."
3,My 2 Cents,"Know that none of the included covers fit any of the saute pans. Also, despite the description, there are no ""knobs that adjust to vent steam for controlled cooking"" or ""T-Fal Thermospots that turn solid red when the pan is properly preheated."""
1,cheap,the handle broke in half from falling from counter on a rug in the kitchen. And no way to get a new handle.
2,Works great at first,I love it when you first start using it. But the inside does wear off and now I wonder how safe they actually are and how much of the wearing off stuff gets in your blood stream. I dropped the one pot and it dented really bad. Next time I will use stainless steel. Feel safer with that. I wont by this product again.JJ
1,Will not last,"I've owned two sets of t-fal cookware and both had to be replaced after two years of use. The non stick surface will wear away with regular use. I'm currently looking into investing in cookware that will last a life time, such as cast iron. It may cost more, but over time, will save money because it will not need to be replaced every few years. If you want something that will last, do not buy t-fal."
4,"Great cookware, but not for stacking!",Cooks and heats evenly. Cleans up easily on inside surface. Bottom of every unit has sharp grooves. These grooves can scratch the inside of another unit if you stack your cookware like I do. Also the grooves tend to collect burned on food and this is hard to get cleaned out.
1,Very Disappointing,Those 3 covers sitting on the pots shown in the picture DON NOT FIT the 3 pans shown in the picture. First time EVER I have encountered this problem. RIP OFF AT ANY PRICE!!!
3,Good value purchase,Wish the large pot was bigger and one of the lids fit one of the fry pans. Good value fot the money.
4,Love it!!!,Love it! Great set.I would recommend this to anyone. I purchased it for an excellent price via the gold box
2,T-Fal Initiatives 10-Piece Nonstick Inside and Out,"I thought these were going to be a great replacement for an old mis-matched set of t-fal I had gotten from a storage auction. I received them quickly but didn't open them until months later since we were going to be moving overseas and I wanted to use the new pots and pans at our new house. I was disappointed to see the ""red dot"" was gone and that instead of a smooth bottom these have grooves on the bottom. They work terrible on our stove here in Germany (they have the smooth top kind). Luckily I had saved a few of the pots and pans from the old set so I've been able to go back to those but I was really disappointed with this set. It was not was I was expecting at all."
2,disappointed,I'm always leery of buying certain things online when you can't see the quality of manufacture first. Cookware is one of them. I thought with t-fals name and the price that this stuff would be pretty good. It's not. This is low end walmart ware or even nearly dollar store quality stuff. All the pans are very light with thin bottoms. I don't expect it to last a year. junk.
4,"Good price, not the highest quality","Well worth the price, got a couple scratches from using a metal spatchula. Non stick works very nice. Screws come loose after a while i had to tighten. overall if you need something cheap these will do the trick. Cant beat free shipping!"
5,T-Fal,"Love this set! Very easy clean up inside and outside. I like that the outside is nonstick, so the T-Fal doesn't hold grease on the outside."
3,Nice pans,"Pretty nice pans, the one thing that I would change is the handles. The handles are hard plastic and have one screw that attaches them to the pan, because of this the handles get loose very easily (upon delivery there were a few that were loose) however the upside is that it's easy to tighten\fix the handles, the design of which I also found to be uncomfortable. All in all, they're non-stick, and they spread heat evenly across the pan, great pans as long as you're not going to be holding one for an extended period of time."
2,Lid Handles are breakable,"On a separate ccasion, I dropped lids on my kitchen floor and all my handles on the lids are broken. Get another pots and pans if you don't like to use broken handles. I don't recommend this item to anyone."
1,Wrong Price,"Bought this as a lighting deal, even had the screen shot to prove that it was supposed to be a certain price. No response to emails to fix the price and no contact numbers to fix the problem. Pretty sad that you can't get customer service from one of the biggest online sellers in the world."
3,Good for the price,"This set is good for the price, but it's very susceptible to scratches. The pans are all marked up after only one brief use."
3,Eh,"I bought these because of the customer reviews. It's a good set, light and cheap but also resistant to junk getting stuck on them. I guess the thing I'm worried about is that the more I use them, the stickier they get. We only hand wash and we only use plastic tools on them so I know it's not us mistreating them. They are good for the value but if you're expecting a high quality heavy set? Don't buy these."
5,Good buy!!,"I waited a while before reviewing this purchase. These pots and pans are the very best that I've ever owned, I only wish that a 3 Quart pan could be added to this set. I've owned them for some time now and they look the very same way they did when I first purchased them - no warping and no flaking of the non-stick coating - and I use these babies every single day 'cause I love to cook. What I have noticed is from time to time the handles become loose but can very easily be tightened with a screw driver. Cleaning up is also a breeze. I'm so impressed by T-Fal's product that I also purchased the Griddle and plan to also purchase the Saute Pan with the lid. A good buy!"
5,Great Cookware!,"You can't go wrong with this set.It is exceptional.We gave our old set away when these came in and have'nt regretted it.The coating is great,nothing sticks.They look sharp and perform very well.The lids are great because you can open them if needed or just leave them closed.They are so easy to clean.We are very pleased with them."
3,Size of lids,"Unfortunately, lids match saucepans only, they don't match pans.Pans are somewhat thin.Box says: made in France, Italy, Hungary, China.Lids and the steam-opening handle could be designed and manufacture better.Though a good deal for the $50, this set is short of ""T-FAL""brand design and quality."
2,The lids are terrible,"No complaints about the saute or sauce pans, the lid design is terrible. Aside from the fact that the sealing mechanism doesn't seal properly, the whole setup is so flimsy one of my lids is completely unusable. My recommendation, is to avoid this set and look for a set with less fancy and more sturdy lids."
4,GREAT VALUE,Got them in the mail today and I have to say for the price I don't see that you could find any better. I'm replacing some much nicer pans but didn't want to spend another 100+ dollars on some pans that last 1-2 years.I read the reviews and some people complained about the lids. I don't see any issues with them they all fit fine. The only issue I have to say I see is the steamer basket is metal and looks like it could scratch the nonstick surface if you are not careful when using it.
4,good overall,Good inexpensive set. I love that it's dishwasher safe. Holding up well after a year of use. Only complaint is that the lids don't fit on the skillets.
3,Paul,"Cracked the knob on the glass lid. Contacted T-Fal and they said - we don't sell the lids separately - nor the knobs. I offered to buy the whole lidbut they thought I should shop around for a ""generic"" replacement. NOT."
4,Good stuff,As I said before the Teflon and aluminum botton of the Tfal set is really great. The handles are the only drawback. They get loose.
4,"so far so good, hence the 4 stars",lightweighteasy to maintainhopefully they'll last long and keep on keepin' on.
3,Serviceable,"I was replacing another T-Fal set that I had used for many many years. This one is ok, but doesn't appear to be nearly as heavy or substantial as the set I used in the past. But, it works fine."
5,Great basic set,"I have several expensive All Clad pans, but I was looking for a non stick frying pan and this set happened to be selling for a great price so I bought it instead. Very glad I did. T-Fal makes the best non-stick cookware in my opinion, and we are putting it to good use. Although the small saucepan will probably not get much use, all the fry pans and larger pots are a good addition to my kitchen. I like that I can make a large pot of rice and it never sticks or gets burned at the bottom."
5,Extremely Entertaining,"Marlon Brando has some of the best one-liners in any comedy. very memorable stuff. It is great fun to watch him spoof his own portrayal of ""The Godfather"". Broderick and Bruno Kirby both give it their best here. I laugh out loud every time I watch this. Worth checking out just to see Burt Parks singing ""Maggies Farm"" at the Goumet Club."
3,Cute movie full of inside jokes for Godfather fans.,Matt Brodrick underplayed performance coupled with Bruno Kirby and Marlon Brando's first rate work makes this a movie that produces a lot of laughs.The Godfather jokes abound and all play well. Brando being Brando steals the show and runs with it.This is the perfect movie to watch with your wife just enough of everything to please everyone.
5,Good movie.,"This is one movie that,if you really look at it,isn't hilarious...but,it's funny in its own way! It's about a college fresham,Clark (Matthew Broderick) going to film college for the first time. When he is looking for the subway,he trips over a homeless man and gets helped up by some guy. The guy offers to drive him to the college and Clark finally agrees after some time. When they reach their destination,Clark gets out and goes to the trunk to wait for the guy to open it...as soon as Clark is around,the guy drives away with all the stuff in the trunk. A while after he sees that same guy walking down the street and he chases,catches,and tells him to give his stuff back. The guy didn't have his money but MOST of his clothing. The guy told Clark that he could give him a job paying $500 a trip. That's where Clark gets himself into trouble,not realizing what he was doing. This is a funny and cute movie. I would recommend this if you are bored and looking to watch a movie that'll relax you."
1,"Idiotic,stupid, ridiculous, and inane","If there was ever a stupid and idiotic idea for a movie, this is it. Any kind of aliens from any planet invading any place would make more sense than this movie. The only redeeming feature is Brando's performance, which in the context of the plot, writing, and other performances, is a miracle.This movie idea and script is straight out of the trash. A five year old kid could write a better script. Each and every executive who ok'ed this movie should be fired and never work again in film."
5,Perfect combo - Brando and Broderick,"This has long been a favorite of mine. Brando brilliantly creates the calm, confident and powerful 'importer' with Matthew Broderick always wonderful as the benign and principled young man thrust into impossible situations. Broderick always brings my late son to mind, having always resembled him, physically, personality and integrity. This is a WONDERFUL exploration of how silly our ideas about mafioso can be. Terrific performances all around. I always recommend this film."
3,Great story but not the most user-friendly book,"Forestor tells the details of naval battles in a rousing and very informed way as well as interjecting a little humor here and there as the story warrants. Focusing on the pomposity of the British and the skill of the Americans, he nevertheless covers every side of the issue - from privateers to Napolean - and frequently relates it to modern day events (which, for the author, was WWII).My complaints may stem from a difference in the generations, but I'm a student and Forestor assumes the reader knows the difference between a sloop, a frigate, and a ship of the line as well as many other aspects of 19th century sailing. When he talks about sails and rigging and displacement, I understand the gist of it, it just would have been nice to start with an explanation of these things.As for the book on tape, if you're getting this one for research purposes, find the printed version. There's just far too much info here to cover in tapes."
1,Boring,"I'm a big James Woods fan and came across this movie here. I have never heard of it and it is not available at any of the video stores in my area. So I ordered it because of all the positive reviews here, but wound up turning it off in the middle. It was real long, uninteresting, and was taking too long for anything to happen. If you haven't seen this movie before, I would recommend you not buy this yet, like I did. Try checking out ""Indictment"" or ""Dirty Pictures"", two of Woods's best movies."
4,A splendid display of the triumph of idealism over cynicism.,"True Believer is a film that shows how the human spirit changes, loses its way but is redeemed. James Woods gives a masterful performance as Eddie Dodd, a burnt out lawyer who loses sight of why he first became a lawyer. The sincerity of his performance shines when together with Kim (the Korean wrongly accused of murder) he confesses that the case was really about two people with similiar dilemmas trying to find redemption. The final courtroom scene was masterful as Woods slyly leads the DA to reveal the awful truth behind the original murder case. That scene has the same intensity as the scene in ""A Few Good Men"" but with more restraint. The plot is well structured with a few twists. Robert Downey, Jr is a good compliment to Woods, balancing the cynicism with a boyish idealism. Margaret Colin is supportive and also balances Woods with an interesting mix of street smarts and pragmaticism."
4,Desirous,"I saw this film on the big screen when it first came out & must say it translated better there than on my 24"". Thus the ""lost star"". A contemplative film best viewed in a relaxed serious mood with lights out. A different journey for the mind as the angelic ventures towards the human. A kind of opposites attract. Not recommended to the hyperactive viewer."
5,Watch out: Masterpiece !!,"This film is one of the best ever. The lovestory of an angel falling in love with a woman, trapeze artist in a circus. He abandons his wings to become a man and to declare his sentiments to the woman he loves. But as soon as he touches the ground, he realises that the circus has moved... Also nice to see Peter Falk as an Angel who also lost his wings because of an excess of humanity."
5,A dreamy nocturne . . .,"Imagine a two hour dream. Imagine hearing the unspoken fears and hopes of ordinary people as they make their way through life. The good and the bad. The simple joy of living. This is what Mr. Wenders captures on the big screen. Shot in black-and-white for the first hour and a half, but switching to vivid color for the ending . . . when Damiel, the central angel, falls to live an ordinary life of pain and, finally, bliss . . . when he finds his angel. Make no mistake, this is a masterpiece. The dignity of man is found is the simple hum drum existance of bleeding, thinking, loving. There are angels over the streets of Berlin."
5,Engel Ueber Berlin! - Angels Over Berlin!,During the 80's and 90's I was lucky to live in Berlin.Now I am back in New Jersey. Sometimes I get homesick. Do you want to know what I do? I shove this movie into the VCR. It gives an awesome view on Berlin and its people. Couldn't have been more realistic.
5,amazing film,"This is an amazing film. It was my favorite film of all time until Prospero's Books, and it still my second favorite. When are there going to be more Wim Wenders DVDs? Anyway, the DVD is pretty light on the bonus features. Given how long it has taken for this to come out, it would have been great to have more (or any), but the transfer is good and that is the most important thing."
4,"""time heals, or maybe time is the illness""","Don't be discouraged by the slow pace of the movie. You need to keep in mind when this movie was made and the theories of existence in vogue at the time. Bruno Ganz shines as an angel who listens to peoples' introspection and gets intrigued by the emotions that only humans experience.Once Henry Van Dyke said:""Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but those who love, time is eternity."" So will the angel Will the Angel choose eternity in heaven or eternity through love? The journey is yours to discover and it is worth the time!"
5,Simply Brilliant,"This is the first 5-star rating I have given, and I'd really like to give this movie 10. It is perfection. Mesmerizing from the first moment, you are drawn in by the symbolism, the spiritual (not necessarily religious) atmosphere, amazingly creative and artistic filming, brilliant dialog, and above all else, the perfect performance by Peter Falk playing... well... Peter Falk.Watch this movie. Buy this movie. Give this movie as a gift. Perfect for any intellectual on your Christmas list. This is truly the art of cinema."
2,Yikes and eww...,"I have friends who might be into this stuff, if only because they like the old and the strange. Me, I'm just like -- Is this ""It's a Wonderful Life""?I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if I picked up the script. As it is, this just barely seems to translate into a movie, and--forgive me for I have my own opinion--""City of Angels"" was a good movie. Too bad if you don't like all this ""contemporary nonsense."" I feel like it worked.My opinion: it's long, it's boring, it's hard to hear. Even if it has a message, I just can't relate to it. So maybe that's my problem.Your opinion: your own. keep it. you're lucky I gave it two stars."
1,Watch this at night when you want to get to sleep,"Like the reviewer who said the movie makes you ask the question: ""Why am I here?"" I too asked that question while watching this movie. This movie is my candidate for the most boring movie I've ever seen. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a -3.5. It would have been even lower except there are some nice clips of old Berlin. The movie plot wasn't believable and the acting was mediocre. It's one of those movies where I constantly was imagining what the cast and crew on the other side of the camera were doing.There. That's it. I've wasted enough time on this film."
3,"Genius, yes -- but dull","Slow and dull as watching paint dry or grass grow -- but brilliant in a way, too."
1,Disappointment,"Perhaps because I had been so entranced by ""City of Angels,"" the remake of this film, my disappointment is great. This is a somber, dreary film with subtitles that don't seem to make sense in colloquial English. But, then, maybe my disappointment is really over the ending of ""City of Angels,"" because the heroine in ""Wings of Desire"" was not killed. Why did this happen to Meg Ryan's character in ""City of Angels?"""
5,Stunning,"The remake is standard Hollywood gloss, but the original is stunning, sensitive and moving. Words don't do it justice, neither does VHS -- for those with a multi-region DVD player, this IS available on DVD from Amazon's UK site."
2,Not Impressed,"This movie was far off the beaten path. Very disjointed. The dialogue, particularly Peter Falk's part, is totally improvised. The 'Hat' scene was especially painful.Not sure how this film gets such high ratings from so many reviewers. So much potential, so little substance. It was a chore to sit through, waiting for ..... anything."
3,Note to the hearing impaired,"This is a note to the hearing impaired re this Criterion release: There are a number of scenes in the movie in English, and there are no closed captions or subtitles for those scenes."
2,Ending Ruined It,"Begins with superb concept, capable actors, fresh cinematography. But ONLY Peter Falk holds our interest. Then the director has no clue what to do. Nick Cave's poseur song and the woman's trite monologue undo every ounce of resonance. Roger Ebert is dead wrong about this film."
5,ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW...,Easily one of the BEST Films I have EVER seen! Let's just hope the transfer to DVD does this beautiful film justice. And stay away from that shoddy American impostor of a film;This one is the real deal!
2,not for me,"I saw City of Angels, and read that it was based on Wings of Desire which was supposed to be more of an artistic film; the film was in German with subtitles, which I was aware of, but it was just really difficult getting into it and it was very long; maybe in English it would have made a difference.....maybe not!"
5,"This film has a exellent mixture of action,adventure,love...","This film is exellant with lots of cool stunts like climing up the massive moutain at the end and the enormous ski jump,AND the bit when Bond and his babe are tied up and they get pulled under the water.The music is funky and has a good beat and the opening song is the best opening song out of ALL the Bond films.It's about this thing[I forgot what it's called]which can use the British ships to fire on their own county.It gets nicked and Bond has to get it"
3,For Your Eyes Only,"""For Your Eyes Only"" marks James Bond's return to down-to-earth espionage after comic book adventures ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker"". But I must say I find those more entertaining. ""For Your Eyes Only"" has some very good action scenes, most notably a long car chase, but the story feels like a rather uninspired rehash of ""Thunderball"" and the villain is forgettable as are the Bond girls (although Lynn Holly Johnson may be remembered for being annoying).Some think it's Moore's best Bond movie, but in my opinion, ""For Your Eyes Only"" is one of the weakest Bond movies."
4,ForYour Eyes Only,"I,ve been a james Bond fan for years, I collected all the bond movies in vhs, now I have them in dvd, for your eyes only, was an injoyment to view, far away countries action great stunts, and roger moore, the englishman has a great sence of humor. this movie is one of the best.for anyone wishing to start a james bond collection, you should start one. you will not regrect it."
3,Eyes Only 007,"Stunt, after stunt, after stunt obliterates this film's attempt to return the James Bond series to its original origins. Roger Moore gives a competent performance as 007 but the physical stunts that he is supposedly performing defy credibility. It is interesting how the level of physical stunts that James Bond is required to perform increases proportionally with Roger Moore's age with each new film.The first two thirds of the film are good. However, the film falls asleep in the third. When you've seen one impregnable mountaintop fortress, you've seen 'em all. Bill Conti's disco score actually helped this film along the way giving it some energy and drive. It is in the final third of the film that Conti returns to a more traditional orchestral scoring which only contributed to the anti climatic finale.The sinking of the St. Georges, the attack on Kristatos' warehouse and Bond kicking Locque's car, with Locque still inside, off the cliff were high points that were excellently filmed."
4,a great movie,Bought as a gift for a huge James Bond fan. I have not personally viewed it so I am not sure of the quality but it is BluRay so it can't be bad and it's JAMES BOND.
4,One of Roger Moore's best,"For Your Eyes Only has everything a James Bond needs a great song, exotic locales, mysterious bond girls and good action sequences. And being on of Roger Moore's best it is a must for any serious James Bond fan."
4,Solid Showing,One of the most solid all round Bond films. Another good performance from Roger Moore(one of his best) and this helps his claim to the title of The Best Bond. Good action Sequences. Slightly unbelivable in parts but still some of the best of the Roger Moore era. Julian Glover plays the lead vilian Aris Kristartos and is the most carismatic and charming bond vilian but is backed up by a poor secondary vilian in Erik Kreigler. Good bond girl in Melina Havelock but she dosn't have much to say thats interesting really.Backed up with an OK score from Bill Conte
5,This review is For your eyes only,"The title, acting, scenery, and well everything is great about this movie. Roger does a great job as bond and the ATAC system: how appropriate. Great plot too. A must for anyone who likes Bond, James Bond."
4,"Bond, James Bond!","This takes a close second place to ""The Man With The Golden Gun"".If you are a bond fan, and you haven't seen this one, I would buy it today, and watch it. This is one of the great Bond movies.Great espionage and intrigue. If you like bond movies for the story, and not all of the gadgets, this is the one for you.I think that this is Roger Moore's most realistic Bond, but not the most interesting."
5,"""Ah, the sharks have him.""","After MOONRAKER, Cubby Broccoli brought the series down to earth in FYEO -- a Bond remanicent of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Roger Moore gives his toughest performance as 007 and gets put through the paces. Caroline Bouquet as Melinda, Topol as Columbo (a character in the Kerim Bey mold), Julian Glover (INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE) as Kristatos and Lynn Holly Johnson as a nymphet. Great action work (especially the wild ""ride in the country"" and the battle in Albania) interesting score by the late Bill Conti (ROCKY) and direction by former Bond editor and 2nd unit director John Glen. Based on the short stories ""For You Eyes Only"" and ""Risico"". This one harkens back to the classic Bonds and de-emphasis on gadgets and gimmicks."
2,Average- 2.5 stars,"Many people liked this because it went back to Fleming formula. True, but this is the most boring and uninteresting Bond film ever (despite fantastic action scenes). Moore should have been replace for this film for one. He lumbers in a daze throughout it. BLAND. If only there was more wit and punch (like Thunderball, Goldfinger, and OHMSS) this would have been excellent."
1,Sleep inducing,"Yawn, yawn, snore, snore. That's about all I did when I watched this film. Watch Spy Who Loved Me, that's a Bond movie."
2,For No One,"Roger Moore as a Bond for the Reagan years -- a waxy, vacant dummy with dyed hair and rouge on his cheeks, faking various macho poses in close-up while the stunt man does all the real work. The rugged locations and well-crafted plot are reminders of this series' great early years, but the producers made a big mistake when they scaled this Bond movie back to human size... they no longer had a human to play him."
5,Best Bond movie of the series.,"This Bond film has been my favorite over the years and I never tire of it. Carole Bouquet is simply gorgeous as James' love interest, she is passionate and strong (not the most gifted actress but she holds her own). Her daring crossbow makes her fresh, and her passion to find revenge in the death of her parents an interesting sidebar to the ""spy vs spy"" storyline.The plot is detailed and fast paced, with lots of the Bond gadgets and action. The underwater scenes were well done, and the spy plot not as far fetched as other Bond flicks (such as Moonraker).Roger Moore throws in the occasional adlib, and it works in this movie. Overall, a great action movie, sure to please the Bond fan - worthy of 5 stars."
3,Bad... but horribly good,"As bond films go this one isn't very amazing. The bad guys are uninspiring, Roger Moore is his usual painstakingly non-action-star self, and what is with the teenage skater?That all said, how do I knock a Bond film?? Put aside all such unimportant things as acting/screenplay quality and you're left with some very admirable qualities. You get the story of a secret agent travelling the world to exotic locations, meeting and wooing beautiful women as he goes. There are explosions, the must have ski chase scenes, amusing one liners, and much much more."
3,DVD soundtrack out of sync,"I just purchased ""FOR YOUR EYES ONLY"" on DVD. This is one of my favorite Bond movies, and while the picture quality is great, the characters voices don't sync up very well. The soundtrack is a second or two ahead of the picture in some places. But all in all I love the DVD."
2,Seemed like a made for TV movie,"This movie had a boring villain, no gadgets, a terrible soundtrack, and just didn't seem like a bond film at all. Maybe it's just that I don't like Roger Moore, but I found this movie to be very boring, especially when compared with any of the earlier films with Sean Connery or George Lazenby. The plot was pretty lame as well. Moore tries to retrieve some machine that would controll British submarines while some double crossing british guy tries to sell it to the Russians. A lot of the other reviewers seemed impressed with the stunts and action scenes, and I would have to agree that they weren't too bad, which is the only reason this film got two stars. A good Bond film however will have a fairly compelling storyline where the action scenes flow into it. In this movie though, it seemed like the entire film was just one big excuse for Bond to get chased down a mountain by guys on motorcycles. If only Moore could make another film like The Spy Who Loved Me."
2,The Best of a Bad Lot,"On the Roger Moore meter, ""For Your Eyes Only"" is a definite improvement over the depressing wretchedness of ""Live and Let Die,"" ""Man With the Golden Gun"" and ""Moonraker"" -- and it has a bit more depth than the lavish yet redundant ""Spy Who Loved Me."" However, it isn't a terribly memorable adventure and the villains are forgettable. On the other hand, Moore gives his best 007 performance and the pre-credit sequence is quite fun. Even though ""For Your Eyes Only"" is a nice change of pace from the usual Bond formula, it still lacks the sparkle of the early Connery classics."
5,Good blu-ray and good movie,"Good transfer and one of Roger Moore's better Bond adventures in which there was an attempt to be more ""grounded."""
5,James Bond,This was a gift for a family member and they loved it. James Bond what can I say. It was a very enjoyable movie.
4,Bond back on form and it's good!,"Regardless of Moonraker's huge commercial success, it was generally regarded as an over-the top mess, taking the character of James Bond too far and becoming laughable. Thank goodness for director John Glen, who stepped in to helm this and four more Bond films (Octopussy, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill). The action and character in this entry are brought down to earth and make this one of the best bond films. Roger Moore, here in his fifth outing as the vodka martini-drinking secret agent sits well into the surroundings. And while he is starting to show his age compared next to the young Lynn- Holly Johnson, the movie itself is a great action flick taken from one of Ian Flemming's best novels."
3,Good movie bad DVD,"For Your Eyes Only is one of my favorite Bond movies. The skill with which the Ian Flemming collection of short stories was adapted it the screen as a single storyline is masterful, however the DVD transfer leaves much to be disired. The image has been artificially sharpened harshly which causes crenelated edges in the image. When I compare the DVD to the quality of the transfer on Goldeneye it just does not hold up."
2,This is supposed to be good!,"FYEO is a largely overrrated lackluster film. Characters are good and story is fine, but can't stand music or acting. Moore is looking a bit too old and worn out, Glover is annoying as Kristatos, and there are no gadgets! Action is okay, but the feel is bad, and the sets are uninspired."
2,Like watching paint peel...,"A mind-numbingly dull Bond film, with walking wax manniquin Roger Moore as 007. Lots of athleticism, as Bond plows through the Winter Olympics sport by sport, deep sea dives, mountain climbs, Zambonis, and wrecklessly races a European mini in order to save the world from nuclear annihilation. The trouble with this film is it is very much a product of the times: the early '80s clothes and even the design of all the vehicles are all hideous, and the film itself has the look and feel of a television show like ""Rockford Files"" or ""Magnum P.I.,"" just without the redeeming humor. The ""Bond girls,"" mainly emaciated stick figures, are so bad that James even kicks one out of bed early in the show. Plus, the title song is by Sheena Easton... need I say more?Eminently skippable."
4,"Roger Moore's ""From Russia With Love""","""For Your Eyes Only"" abandons the high tech gadgetry and focuses on story, suspence and even romance. This is Moore's best performance as Bond as he relies more on his wits and bravery than gadgets and one liners. Not only one of the best Moore Bonds but also one of the best Bonds all together."
5,White Gold Chain,The chain was purchased to wear with a white gold and diamond cross. The chain compliments the cross better than I could have imagined. The chain is just a brilliant as the diamond cross.
3,A decent movie about an important story.,"Jeb Stuart's ""Blood Done Sign My Name,"" based on the book of the same name by Timothy Tyson, is better for the story it tells than for its filmmaking craft. The story--about a racially motivated murder and the resulting civil rights activism in a small North Carolina town circa 1970--is so moving and vital that all Americans should know it. However, Stuart's direction--though solid and competent--is unexciting, and the performances are good but not outstanding. There are so many characters and plotlines that none of the actors or characters has a chance to stand out. In the end, the film seems too diffuse. The photography and music are notable. I would give this film three and a half stars if I could; it's a cut above the mediocrity implied in a three-star rating, but not quite good enough to merit the endorsement implied by four."
5,Gosh the hero is funny,Add me as a GH fan. This book is really marvelous and the hero may be my all time favorite. He is so dryly funny it takes your breath away. What a wonderful love story.
3,good but others are better,"There have been many reviews already, so just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.This was the first GH book I ever read and, while I feel it is just in the ""good"" category, it led me to her other books which were even better.No one can write a historical like Georgette. Totally G rated but unbeatable for plot, wit, humor, and drawing you into the story."
4,4 & 1/2 stars; my favorite Heyer to date,"I really liked this book by Heyer. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the lack of romantic feeling by the heroine until the end of the book.Sylvester is witty, well-paced, and evocative of the age. Obvious (and delightful) parallels to Jane Austin, especially Pride and Prejudice, abound. Sylvester is a great hero, flawed but teachable. Phoebe is slightly less compelling as the heroine, coming across as a bit immature, but she can certainly hold her own with Sylvester and many others (her step-mother being the odd exception).Secondary characters, especially Thomas, are delightful and add greatly to the story. Witty & charming, with a certain poignancy to Phoebe's self-esteem issues. It's nice to have a heroine who isn't a beauty, too. A must read."
5,Very Impressed,"Wow, this was the second Georgette Heyer novel I've read. It was great. The way the characters reacted to situations was so believable. I can't wait to read more of her books. They're romances, but they're also very clean. It's hard to find that combination."
3,Tastes change,Loved this as an adolescent and have always remembered it. Rereading it after half a century away and Du Maurier is far the better writer. This retained none of the magic it held in my youth while rereading one of Du Maurier's books at the same time brought back the original pleasure.
5,The Sparrow is indeed my Darling!,"I loved it! Loved everything about it. Sylvester was charmingly arrogant and Phoebe was willful and a loose cannon. The combination of the the two characters, explosive! I rather like the meddlesome grandmother to Phoebe and the mother of Sylvester. Edward, the ward and nephew of Sylvester was a hoot. The Dukes sister in law was the silliest of the characters, not to be out done by her most silly fiancé /husband. In this book the House of Rayne does REIGN!!!"
2,way too flexible,This flipper bends too easily so you can't get enough under the food you want to flip. I was disappointed. Have to try another one.
2,OK straps but clips are way too big,"I have two full-size accordions. I bought a set of these straps and was disappointed because I couldn't get them to attach to either accordion. The clips that connect the straps to the accordion are way too big. They are huge, plastic-covered things. I finally got them to attach by filing down the plastic covering on the clips, but they are still very klunky-looking. It's too bad, because the straps themselves are very nice."
3,"Well made, comfortable, but too long for my 37 key accordion","I tried this Neotech strap along with theNeotech Accordion Harness Strap. I found the Mega strap to be extremely comfortable, but the length was too long for my 37 key accordion. Build quality and materials seem very good, though. I initially rated this product 4 stars. I emailed the company to report my problems with the length to see if they had any solutions. I have not received a reply yet, so I am taking off 1 additional star for poor customer service."
5,This could quite possibly be the best soap ever,"I work on environmental projects and I frequently pass on a bar of Get Real to people who are getting rid of all the petroleum-based soaps in their home. The label is pretty clear - this soap has ""No Fake Crap"" and it's loads better for you than the junk in the best-selling soaps.PLUS - the soap is delicious. It's got just the right amount of exfoliant in it and the smell is gorgeous without being over-powering. The first time I put it in the shower, my husband came out actually mentioned how awesome it was. And he's the kind of guy who barely registers what type of products we're using...I'd have to consider his newly found soap-enthusiasm to be the most ringing endorsement I can provide for this product!"
2,Worst Bond if there was no CONNERY,"Sean really tries to save that movie which as for me has some of worst components of the series as: Girls, Villain (Blofeld is smaller than Kissy?), title- song and may-be plot. Totally unrealistic!"
3,Bond near the end,"Made after the fabulously successful ""Thunderball"", this film tried to out do its predecessors and in doing so, began to lose the impact of the series."
5,The Best Bond movie in the universe,"Out of all Bond movie's, this one is my favorite. Except for the fact that Kissy, the bond girl is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. It is so dumb why they cut the other one off. Well anyways, a space capsule was captured and hijacked. The Americans think the Soviets did it. Next, another capsule is captured and believe that the Americans did this to retaliate. The tension between the two could create another war. James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate. There, he finds the evil leader of SPECTRE has done this so when the 2 most military countrys destroy eachother. When that has happened, Blofeld will take opporitunity to seize the world. There was a lot of action in this movie. Like.1. The Space capsule hijack2. The building fight.3. The car chase and helicopter4. Little Nelie chase/fight5. The dock gunfight6. The final finale, the crater battle."
5,My Favorite Bond Movie,I love this movie. I have lost count of the number of times I have seen it. It's my favorite Bond Movie.
3,Sean Connery is the only James Bond,"Movie productions should have ceased when Connery gave up the role. If you watch these films in chronological order (as I did) you will see that this one is the beginning of the end - predictable, special effects and gimmicks reliant."
5,Brand New with a Slim Casing,"The product description said like new, but it was completely new, which makes me happy. The DVD did come in a slim case, which means you can't put the booklet inside the case, but that's not a big problem. I only need two more Bond movies to complete the collection :-)"
3,"""YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, MR. BOND.""","I can't understand why everyone always puts ""YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE"" down so much. It's not as exciting as some of the best Bond movies (""GOLDFINGER"", ""FOR YOUR EYES ONLY"", ""DIE ANOTHER DAY""), but it is entertaining in its own way. We finally get to see Blofeld, played brilliantly by the late Donald Pleasance. I wish he had more screen time though. It's funny how Charles Gray is in this movie and then he winds up playing Blofeld in ""DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER."" This isn't a bad movie. Not in my Top 5 favorite Bond movies, but it's entertaining. Plus the title song by Nancy Sinatra is #7 on my all time Bond song list. (Behind FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, DIE ANOTHER DAY, ALL TIME HIGH, A VIEW TO A KILL, NOBODY DOES IT BETTER and LIVE AND LET DIE.)"
3,"Connery's worst, which isn't that bad!","Japan is a great setting, but it's never used to it's fullest (but you cna't expect a Kurosawa movie, which actually would have been interesting to see). While Pleasance is my favourite Blofeld (and Mike Myers based his Dr. Evil a lot on him) his character has a very inane plot which borders on really campy."
4,bond exhausts!,"You Only Live Twice is the biggest action Bond to date! The non-stop chase and action scenes definitely foreshadow the Bond of our times! And the new re-masters capture it all! An ambitious effort, very involving, exotic locations on a grand scale; no holding back in this film, there are even space-craft sequences!"
4,JAMES BOND TURNING JAPANESE...,"I really think so. YOLT, with Connery in bad make-up and bowl cut wig no less, is an enjoyable romp that makes no apologies for not taking itself too seriously...Connery in a kimono further supports that theory. Forget the unbelievable story...you have Nancy Sinatra offering proof she was a singer; Bond getting his ""first civilized bath"" and Little Nellie. Give me this one. some saki served at the correct temperature and a spicy tuna roll and I'm content in any lifetime."
2,The Weakest Bond Of All. A Big Dissapointment.,"You Only Live Twice is by far the worst Bond film of all. A weak story and a bland villian, Blofeld (Donald Pleasence), who is nowhere near as colorful as most Bond villians are. Although, the title song (performed by Nancy Sinatra) is one of the best. The film is a big dissapointment, and just doesn't compare to Dr. No, From Russia With Love, or Goldfinger. The film is slow at times, and seems much longer than it actually is. All in all, You Only Live Twice may be the weakest Bond film, but it is certainly worth a look."
3,[Three-and-a-half] Bond takes it on the chops that year from Flint!,"Sean Connery stubs his toe here as a'reborn' asian-passoff artist to upendevil 'Bloehard', er, ah, Blofeld. Maybethis is where that great Police/DetectiveAnti-Communist show Hawai'i Five-0, whichco-starred Jack Lord as the orginal FelixLighter (not 'LightNer') gots it's sometimesmaddening habit of starring caucasian actorsas orientals! [By The Numbers, To Hell WithBabe Ruth, A Matter of Mutual Concern, Samurai,others...] No, as much as I really like SeanConnery, the former Scottish golden gloves box-er, he's no more convicing as an asian act-ali-ke as Mark Lenard, and other Hawai'i Five-0 ac-tors were. It was time for a break from Bond inthat year anyway as this film got sandwiched be-tween two fine Flint films! Advantage, America!"
2,Connery`s worst-and a plain bore!,"Thunderball was more slow-moving than this one,yet,this one is more boring.Pleasence is ok as Blofeld,but far to slimy to be believable.For one,you are not totally pleased with Connery`s performance.He goes on routine far to much!High points: Little Nellie,Tiger Tanaka.Low points: the plot."
4,"Not Connery's best,but still very good.","I actually give the film 4 and a half stars.It finally shows the face of villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld,who was nicely played by Donald Pleasance.It's got the usual beautiful women,lots of action,and of course the gadgets.(I especially liked Bond's helicopter ""Little Nellie"") The theme song,sung by Nancy Sinatra,was excellent.Overall,while not as good as From Russia With Love or Goldfinger,it's still a very good Bond film."
4,Another Good James Bond Movie,"Being A James Bond fan, I like this movie, but the ending is not one of the best. Still it does have a set of interesting villains!"
3,good,"I got the dvd faster than I expexted which is good, it just the box of dvd was broken, but thanks anyway"
3,"Sub-par Connery, but enjoyable","This is probably the weakest of the Sean Connery Bonds, but let's face it, whenever Connery is playing Bond- it's still good.The Japanese locale is filmed to great effect and the story moves along briskly, and Bond Girl Aki is one of the series' best.Now for the not so great parts: Bond being turned into a Japanese guy for a mission is both uninentionally hilarious and slightly racist. It's also hard to watch Donald Pleasance as bald headed villain Blofeldt without wanting to shout out Dr. Evil lines like ""Onneeeeee Milllliooonn Dollllarssssss!"""
5,TWICE IS THE ONLY WAT TO LIVE,"Released in 1967, You Only Live Twice marked the fifth appearance of Sean Connery who had announced he was retiring from the role that made him famous in the first place five years earlier ( he would later return in Diamonds are Forever). The plot has Bond going to Japan where he must stop his arch nemisis Ernest Stavro Blofeld from starting another World War between the superpowers. YOLT has the best pre-title sequence where we see our hero faking his own death. YOLT has some breath-taking action scenes such as the little-Nellie chase sequence, the dock fight and the grand finale in Blofeld's secret base in the crater of a volcano. YOLT set the standard for the following Bond sequels in the way it had such elabrarate sets. Also this the first time we see the face of sinister criminal mastermind Blofeld."
2,Skip it,"This film was disappointing. Definitely you should rent it, but don't buy it unless you have made it your goal to own all the Bonds."
4,Typical James Bond,I am in the process of watching all of the Bond films in chronological order. I streamed this movie from Amazon over DSL with no problems.
3,You only Live Twice,"The movie was exacly like the one I watched as a younger man. Enjoyable, and the ammount of time I waited untill actual reciving was a short waiting time. I commend the service. One small part on the disk that causes a skip, but I'm a believer in cleaning it to see if it can or might help."
1,I Only Barfed Twice,"This is by far the most disappointing thing Connery has done in the Bond series. The movie is a mindless romp from one fistfight and shootout to the next. I was nearly bored out of my mind. The movie also has the worst Bond villain. I mean sure, Blofeld is a good villain, but how can we hate a guy we meet fifteen minutes before the movie ends? The Bond girls are another proplem. One saves Bond's live and proves to be the predecssor to girls Anya Amasova and Wai Lin. I love her, but then . . . I can't spoil anything for you, so you'll (sadly) have to see the movie. The other girl is Kissy who is never mentioned by name and has as much screen time as Blofeld. The only reason I can think of to this is to be able to truthfully say (like I can) ""I've seen all the Bond films."""
3,A GODZILLA MOVIE WITHOUT GODZILLA,"WEll, that is what You Only Live Twice came across. Leave it to one time Bond scriptwriter Roald Dahl to write a long drawn out story, and to make ill use of the women in the movie. Karin Dor's Helga Brandt was just a Fiona Volpe clone who failed to measure up to her predeccessor. As good as the two Japanese Bond girls are in this film, Aki and Kissy Suzuki, Aki was knocked off way too late in the film and Kissy, when she DID appeared, was given way too little to do. They should have change the script and just combined the Aki/Kissy character into one.You Only Live Twice emerged as the weakest of the Connery films that followed GOldfinger. Too bad, Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama deserved better."
2,"Poorly developed characters, avoid this one","Let the Church Say Amen deals with a lot of familiar themes to black readers. Simon, a pastor of a successful church, neglects his family and all three of his children have major issues that they struggle with. Drug abuse, obsession over a past relationship, and sexual identity are the core themes of this book. Some readers will gain inspiration from Loretta as she works to evolve from a stand by your man pastor's wife to an assertive partner who can influence her husband to devote more time to his family.This was a quick read, but a disappointing one for me. All three of the kids seem to have better versions of them in other black novels. I didn't feel that any of them were very well developed. Perhaps Billingsley has devoted fans who will forgive what may not be her best work, but for me, this book was weak and I'll be looking elsewhere for my next dive into black fiction.2 stars--SD"
4,A good read,"I really enjoyed reading this book and looking at the family of a church pastor. He is dealing with the congregation and their issues and not concentrating on his own family with everything else going on. This book really opened my eyes to the conplications of a minister and the life his/her family must lead. They are just like everybody, we all have our issues. I am looking forward to reading more by ReShonda Tate Billingsley."
3,Just O.K.,"It wasnt the best book, however, I wanted to know how novel was going to end.Besides the foul language, I would pass it along to my 18 year old neice."
2,Be Careful,"This book is listed under 'Christian' fiction, but the language gave cause for pause. I could have really enjoyed this book if the language was not so offensive. As an African American Christian woman, I enjoy a good novel. I could not recommend this one to fellow Christians."
1,amen it's over,Very easy read rather short and to the point. Mad at times however it was something to read and discuss with book club....! Which we sum up rather quickly:(........!
4,"Good Book, Waiting for the movie.","I heard this book is being made into a BET movie and wanted to read the book first. Suprise! I really liked the book, the characters were believable and the situations were real, not sugar coated like I was expecting. These are people like ones you see every day with their problems and mis-steps. Looking forward to seeing how the book translates on screen."
4,DRAMA!!!,"You talk about drama! If you are looking for a book that certain demonstrates a dysfunctional family that over comes the odds, then this is definitely one! This one book has every single type of family issue there is all wrapped up into one from the teenage pregnacy to someone trying to still your man. It was an easy read because some parts of it were predictable. I read it in a day mostly just so the drama wouldn't monopoly two of my days. I do plan on reading the sequel though I am not sure why because the ending pretty much resolved the story. I can not imagine how much more drama they can get themselves into. If you are like me and like to read story that make you feel WONDERFUL about your own life, then this book is surely one - fiction or not - that foolishness is really out there for some!"
3,Title Doesn't Match Story,"I read this one last month and when I finished, I said ""what does the title have to do with the storylines?"" Why would the church say ""amen"" to a pastor's daughter's uncontrollable behavior; his son's homosexuality; his eldest son's drug problems; and, last but not least, the pastor himself--his neglect of his family issues. I know that the author will probably rebuttal this, but I'm not knocking the storylines, I just want to know what does the title have to do with the storylines? Instead the title should be The Pastor's Family or The Pastor's Children, or something to that effect. Just my entitled opinion, that's all."
1,Read it if you have nothing else good to read,"This is how i would put it. If you read all of your good books, then you might want to read this from your ""later"" pile if you have nothing else good to read. My bookclub was wrong for selecting this."
2,Christian Fiction?,"When I first started reading this book I got caught up in the characters and then the storyline became so obvious about how the pastors children would turn out. I get so disappointed when I read a novel that is suppose to be Christian fiction and uses profanity throughout the book. I was looking for an uplifting novel, but instead it leaves you depressed. Let's just say if you like drama, this is the book for you, but if you are a Christian don't bother to read this book."
2,"Misleading (Not what I Consider ""Christian Fiction""","I bought this book for my 16 year old step-daughter. I let her borrow a lot of my ""Christian Fiction"" books, and though I do read, non-Christian fiction as well, I wouldn't openly expose her to just anything (Both her mother & I are very active in our respective churches and care a lot about what things are influences in her life.) I borrowed the book from her, and was very saddened to find that there was as much cursing and vulgarity in the book as there is in ANY OLE BOOK YOU PICK UP off the shelf. There are ways to depict certain actions and behaviors, without blatently ""putting it out there"". The storyline is very perdictable which makes it a quick read. Had I purchased it as ""just a book"", I would have said it's okay, but I bought this as ""Christian Fiction""."
3,Ok fiction,"I read this book because I am reading the book called Nothing but Drama which has Rachel from Let the Church Say Amen leading a young girls' group. I wanted to read her background first before I finished Nothing But Drama. The main problem that I had with this book is that is categorized as Christian fiction in my library and it uses profanity. I am not sure if that is how this book is categorized in stores. I had a problem with the profanity. I do not curse in part because I am a Christian and I just do not want to read it in a book. This is not a problem for most people and if you decide to read it you will enjoy it. I did learn something from the book for my own family and that is to not devote so much time to noble causes (i.e. church, charity events, sports, etc.) and neglect the family. It is not worth it."
4,"Clean, wholesome book!","This was a very good book. If you are looking for some drama without the cussing and heavy sex this book is it. It's not to churchy,either. It was a breath of fresh air for myself,from all the urban books I have been reading. That Rachel is a mess,but she is a HOT mess in the sequel."
3,A medicor attempt,"As mentioned above; this is a mediocore film at best. I liked the one about the Famous Tecumsa. They a much BETTER job that this. WHOEVER, If you are a master historian like myself; by all means get this."
3,"Worth the read, however....","Christian Cafarakis does an excellent pr job for Aristotle Onassis and Jackie. Whilst reading it I wondered where he got his information from as clearly he was not there or privy to some of the information.Informative both about Maria Callas and Jackie's relationship with Ari but I have to say that Mr gage's book ""Greek Fire"" surpasses all. I hoped to have learned more about the man...what made him tic"
3,Gargle blaster,"We bought the original DK 'Volcano' many years ago in video form, the narrator was clear in his diction, unknown and English. The new DVD with narration by Martin Sheen looks like a pallid and shabby copy of the original. The lava flows at times looked like porridge spills and intense colours and tones have a tendency to halo. Martin's narration struggles throughout - ordinarily I really do admire the guy's portfolio but can we please move beyond the concept that nothing can be sold without the golden touch of celebrity. Was he choking, asthmatic or had his sly cigarette habit from the West Wing finally caught up with him?The Eyewitness series is marked by a high quality of work and its sad to see this marred by injudicious interference and bad production."
5,Great Camera - Fun Features - Excellent Pictures,"Bought this camera in a pinch as our old one broke two days before Christmas. Didn't get a chance to read the reviews here first (and I'm glad I didn't or I probably would not have bought it!). I quickly snapped a roll of 24-exposure film to try the camera out and see if we wanted to keep it.The pictures came out BEAUTIFULLY! I took some indoors, some out. Some with the fully automatic point-and-shoot, and expermimented with the potrait mode, sports action mode, and night mode. They all came out fantastically!It's like having two cameras in one - a fully automatic no-brainer point and shoot as well as some features that allow you to be more creative and experimental with photography if you want to. Also a great zoom.Canon must have corrected the issues that some of the eariler reviewers posted, because I did not experience any of these problems."
1,Blurry Pictures!!!,"I was very disappointed when I got my film developed from the Canon Z155!! I went to a concert, took 5 rolls of film, and only like 24 pics came out halfway decent...ALL of the zoomed pictures came out blurry, no matter what setting I tried or what speed of film!! I even had front row, and most didn't come out!! Very Very disappointed... I would not recommend this camera if you want zoomed photos! Even the outdoor zoomed pics were not top quality!!"
3,Challenges conventional thinking about the death of a Legend,"Texas is a traditional breeding ground for Jesse James clones. Is this another one? OR has Ms. Duke revealed a 100 year old hoax perpetrated by the James' family and friends? See the photos, read the diary, consider the ""Hite Theory,"" and decide for yourself. After you put down the book, you may not be convinced, but you'll certainly wonder! Bound to stimulate your interest in the life and times of the James Gang as you try to solve the mystery and determine the Truth for yourself! You may even come up with a few theories of your own! I'll bet Jesse James is chuckling in his grave--WHEREVER that might be."
5,Bought for a 4 y/o birthday present,"He loved it. It was his favorite gift at the party, and he rec'd a lot of nice gifts! He wouldn't stop playing with it. He is into trucks, so if you have a little one that likes trucks, they'll love this one. Even my 2 and 3 y/o daughters wouldn't stop playing with it, lol."
5,great story,i loved this story when i was a child so i bought it for my daughter. she just loves the story. the person i got it from had rips in about 5 pages. but it is a great story any way.
5,Let The Wild Rumpus Start!,"Among the hundreds of books my husband and I have purchased for our seven-year old daughter over the course of her young life, ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is one of the absolute best. She loves the freeing world that Max enjoys and its ever-so-slightly dangerous vibe. When she was younger, my husband and I loved the simple poetry and cadence. It's fun to read! It's almost like singing a song. (My daughter especially loved the female monster.)The message is a good one: our imaginations are rich beyond measure, joy is a universal desire, and one need not go anywhere outside themselves to experience adventure.Let the wild rumpus start!"
5,Movie Will Explain Much,"I re-read ""Where The Wild Things Are"" for the first time in perhaps 15 years, if not longer the day after the film was released. There is and was a spirit in the succinct language that kids get, if they are allowed. You see, they are more wild than mature and refined. The idea that they might be able to escape the confines of growing up is so attractive. I have heard complaints from parents ""not getting it."" I am certain of this. They impose their restrictive, lemming like ignorance on their kids and say that if I don't get this, then you must not either. Their children model what they see. A courageous parent is one who earnestly strives to remember the exact treasure of a fort, a jungle, an adventure, and truly being wild...and then gives this privileged opportunity to their children with encouragement."
5,Where the Wild Things Are : A book for all ages,"I am currently in my last year of college and one of my professors just recently read us a children's book. I was quite surprised when it turned out to be Where the Wild Things Are. Although this is a children's book, everyone enjoyed hearing the story about Max and his magical journey. Where the Wild Things Are is by far one of the best children's books ever written and illustrated. I loved it as a child and I still love it as an adult. The book provides children a chance to use their imagination. This is a book that I will use both as a teacher and with my own children someday. Whether you like the story itself or you just like to look at the illustrations, this is definitely a book for people of all ages. A must have for every classroom and household."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"My sons pre-school class read this book, and I haven't stopped hearing about it yet. This book was easy to follow, and the pictures were the best!"
5,Classic,"Love, Love, Love this book. Classic reading. I had lost my copy years ago and just gave my daughter a new one for Christmas. Made a great gift to the nieces and nephews too."
5,Great book,This book arrived quickly and was as described. The book is a classic and I love reading to my grand children
3,I'm not sure what the rave is all about,"This was never one of my favorite books as a child, and I recently bought a copy just to see what I think 20 years later. I still don't really care for it, and don't like the idea of having somewhat scary pictures of monsters in a childrens' book that's meant to be read before the child goes to bed. It's tastefully done and the illustrations are cute, but I will never understand why this book has a Caldecott Medal and why so many people rave about it. I guess to each his/her own."
4,Something different,"I like reading this story to my little girl. She loves the unique pictures and the story line makes her giggle. It is something different than the normal fairy tale stories, which I happen to be sick of. I think it is a fun book for both me and my little girl to read."
5,A Must-Have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a story of a very bad boy's day of imaginative roll playing and final acceptance of his place in the real world. I love reading it to my little siblings and watching as their little faces lit up in recognition of adventures they had endured during their own periods of bad behavior... Check it out and get it for your brother or your listtle sister. Another MUST HAVE for older kids is the seriesWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 2by Nowiki. Very captivating and touching stories showing the world with cats eyes"
5,A Classic Book,"A great classic story for anyone of any age! I have loved this book from when I was a kid. My child loves it as well! Any type of reading is good for kids, so of course I would recommend this one!"
3,"Love Sendak, but not THIS book","I've been a fan of Maurice Sendak since I first saw his illustrations (which are, quite frankly, everywhere). This book, however, although a classic by any standard, just doesn't do much for me.I must agree with an earlier reviewer who found Max to be a snotty monster. Sure, it's supposed to make a point, but it seems that, rather than come to some internal resolution that changes his behavior, Max is instead rewarded for his awful attitude. Yes, yes, I get it, but it doesn't mean that your kids will. This is easily the sort of book that typically wins Caldecott medals: something that adults get excited about, but something that just doesn't do much for kids.Buy it if you must, but buy it for the art."
2,What are we reading to our children?,I bought this book for my daughters because it was read to me when I was a child. What was the writer smoking back then when this book was written? I can not believe how horrible the story and the writing is. It has no point and was just an utter waste of time. I just wish I would have saved the money and took it out of the library first.
3,Okay Read,"I saw alot of good reviews on this book, so I thought I'd get it.It is not one of my favorites. I have a 3yr old and we love books. Better choices out there."
2,not so inspiring,"The authors idea for the book is good, however the illustrations are very weird. My three year old son does not feel comfortable seeing the pictures. There are better books depicting the concept."
2,"""The Emperor's New Clothes"" of Books?","What story does this book tell you? I didn't ""get"" a story out of it. But there is no disputing how wonderful the illustrations are. This is one of those books that has become a classic for two reasons - parents hear other parents saying, ""Oh, I LOVE that book!"" so they think that they should love it too (even though they really don't get a story out of it either. ""Yes, yes, it is the finest cloth I have ever seen!"") This book won a prestigous award, therefore it must be super, wonderful, superlative, superlative."
5,"A classic, magical book","No child's library is complete without this story of Max who gets into too much mischief and is sent to his room, only to imagine himself in a far away land where he is king and makes all the rules. I loved it as a child and it is one of my children's favorites too."
5,Great book,This is a book you just have to love. I have given it as a gift many times and it has always been well received.
1,Save your money,"This is another book on my top list of overrated ""classic"" books that need to go somewhere and die. I'm in my 30's, and fortunately did not have this book inflicted upon me as a child. I have no clue why this book is popular, other than people who had nothing better to read when they were children remembering this book fondly and passing it on. There are hundreds of fabulous children's books in print today, and I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this book. It has no plot, and Max is an unlikeable brat. I don't get what we're supposed to take away from this book, except that Max's mother still loved him even though he was insufferable. Fortunately, my children don't like this book either."
4,Where The Wild Things Are,"I think it was a very creative cute book for kids. Teachers could have their students create puppets and make puppet shows from this book. I am taking English 324 Literature for Children with Professor Roger D. Samples, he is a wonderful teacher. This book is perfect for children."
2,I don't get the hype,"I thought this book was going to go a lot deeper than it actually did. As I was reading it, I couldn't believe a movie was made based on this particular book. I don't see any redeeming values in the boy. He's just a boy that really doesn't learn or change his ways. I want children's books to have a moral, to teach my child about the good things in the world. This book falls flat in doing that."
3,Where the Wild Things Are,"The classic children story book by Maurice Sendak is an innovative and unique tale. I found myself to be disappointed in the book. It is a rather violent book, for children to read. The images are fascinating but rather scary for younger children. There is nothing like Where the Wild Things Are, but perhaps that is not such a bad thing."
5,Classic,"I read this book as a child, and I remember being fascinated by its vivid illustrations and accompanying storyline. This book will awaken every child's imagination!"
5,Imagination in Abundance,"I never read this book as a child, and was always told that I was deprived.I finally buckled down and read it.I only wish that my parents had bought me this book as a child. I can only imagine where my imagination would have taken me with story like this. My heart was warmed by the sheer innocence of Max and how he could imagine his room as forest and escape to it. I wish that I would have experienced this book as a child, because I was definitely the child that imagined herself as a princess in a far away land.The illustrations are too good for words. They can express so many different events in each one. I love how as long as Max imagined it to happen, it happened.I am so glad that I got to experience this book as an adult and I will make sure that it will onmy child's bookshelf for when he/she learns to read, needs a way to escape :-)"
5,Where the Wild Things Are.,Great Book and a Timeless Classic with some of the most iconic illustrations ever to grace a 10 sentence childrens book. What more can be said?
5,WILD THINGS,"This book is one of my favorites! Max has such a good imagination! I have a good imagination too! The other night I had a really creative dream! Anyway, Max imagines a forest growing in his room! I wish I had a forest in my room! I LOVE trees! And this book! Max meets wild things! My brothers are wild things! I meet them all the time! This is a great book! You should buy it!"
5,for max whose still sitting in my soul wondering ...,someday when your old and tired and cynical and sad you think of a book you read a a child. you remember the monsters in it that (slightly) frightened you (hey .. i was a cowardly kid sue me :) ...you think of the lil kids who gets sent to bed without supper (not infrequently :)... you think of how vivid how real how the book let your imagination grow a jungle in your room.and you smile. its been twenty years since i first read the book and probably fifteen since i last read it. and it made me smile a minute ago. i hope children will smile twenty years from now when they read it ..
4,nostagia,"It is a darker story than I remember. I bought it for my children as I loved it when I was a child, but at 4yo and 2yo it will be a few years before they are ready for it."
5,Wonderful tale for little monsters!,WE love this book!!! Anything by Maurice Sendak is a work of art. My boys enjoy the Little Bear books from my childhood! We love stories to far off lands we can see in our dreams! This book was given to us by a lifelong friend and teacher THANKS!!!
5,Sweet Fun Story,A magical story with a little bit of lesson built into it. The best part is saying the fun-to-pronounce words and looking at the detailed pictures.
5,Wild adventures!,"This is a great book for story time - it is a ""big"" story. A little bit scary, but very, very imaginative. Beautifully illustrated.The hero of the tale is having a bit of a bad day, and has landed himself into a heap of trouble with his mother. It's all about the desire to run away and join the ""wild things"", and then the really strong need to stay where one is loved and safe.I loved this book as a child, and I loved giving a copy to my own son for his birthday. We love reading this together.Definitely one of those ""keep it forever"" books!"
4,Captivating illustrations,My 4 year old daughter loves this book. The illustrations are beautiful and the text is well written for her age. It might be a little scary for a younger child
3,The product said new,"I love this book so much & bought it for my 1 yr old son at a great price, to read to him but not allow him to play w/ it, because I would love him to have this for when he got older too...The paper cover w/ the title was ripped halfway down the page, the back part of the same cover was also ripped and stained... I only wanted to leave this comment for the seller, but it is not allowing me to do that. I was really disappointed. The other 2 books I bought were in great condition, along with the inside of this book."
5,Great book!!,I took a children's literature class a few years ago in college and I am now expecting my first child and I remembered this book and have recently purchased it. It's absolutely wonderful!!
1,Absolutely Atrocious!,"I cannot believe this book is a best seller. Max, the protagonist, is a wild, rude, annoying, little snot-nosed monster. The last thing I want is for my child to model her behavior after him! My daughter received this as a gift and it is now in the trash because I could not bring myself to give it away to another child."
5,Great Condition,"I bought this book new because it was my favorite book when I was a child, and I didn't receive many books, but this one stood out! I loved how imagination made the boys room become a jungle and I loved how he wasn't afraid of these monsters because they were nice."
4,Classic - but frightening,"As a child, this book scared the daylights out of me. As an adult, I recognize the brilliance, but still am cautious about introducing it to my own children."
4,Where the Wild Things Are by Destiny,"I love how Maurice Senak turned Max's room into a forest that he roamed out of and discovered the Wild Things. The best thing that I loved is how they had their rumpus with Max being the King of the Wild Things. Mr. Sendak was brilliant how he made the end of the book, when Max smelled his dinner and came back to his room. Lastly, I thought it was a good idea how Mr. Sendak made Max sail across months, days, and years! I love that book!"
4,another childhood classic,"Sendak's _Where the Wild Things Are_ is another of those classic books from my childhood--this one even won a Caldecott. It's a simple story with some good artwork--perfect for kids. It even contains the underlying theme of home. I loved it as a child, and I'd recommend it for your kids."
3,fine,"This is a crazy, unside down world imaginative story of a boy unset with his mother and working out his anger. Nice pictures, kids like once in a while."
5,the book I loved best as a child.,"My love affair with Maurice Sendak's ""Where The Wild Things Are"" goes back further than I think I can remember. I fell hard for the vibrant prose and unbelievable illustrations. It is a beautiful book throughout and it has absolutely withstood the test of time.I am twenty-four years old now. I love this book as much as I did the first time I read it. This book speaks to places in the heart and the mind that you sort of forget about as you age. It's a magical book, it never fails to transform me.Long live King Max....and all of his beautiful monsters."
4,Where the Wild Things Are,The story is about a boy who rebels against his mother when it came to eating his supper. He was sent to his room where he dreamed about living where The Wild Things Are. Once there he became lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him most of all. This aspect of the story is a perfect example of any child rebelling and later realizing that their parents love him/her and they love their parents. The story is good for any child to listen or even read. It contains a moral that we can all relate to at one point in our childhood life time. That is why I would strongly recommend this book for any parent that has rebelling child.
5,Great Book,I love this book! It was one of my favorites as a child. I bought it for a friend's baby.... A must have for children!
4,Where the Wild Things Are,Read this book years ago to my children and now my grandson. Good imagination story. Haven't seen the movie but the books are always better.
2,a little disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed when I read the book through. I don't thinkmy grandchildren will understand or appreciate the book as written. They alllove to read, but this is written beyond their grasp. I was hoping for amore child-friendly book. I felt it was too adult or not enough child-like.Maybe next time."
5,Love it!,"I loved this book as a child and I now read it to my son.....it is beautifully made, and a cute story about using your imagination"
5,Where the Wild Things Are is a wonderful book for everyone.,"Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are is a fantastic book that explores the imagination of an unruly little boy named Max. Sendak combines dark and slightly scary paintings with some of the most vivid textual imagery any children's book could offer. Where the Wild Things Are has an underlying moral that enhances the meaning of the text without over doing it. Children will get bored with a book if the moral is too overstated. Sendak combines his moral in a way that children and parents alike do not feel beat over the head with it. Without giving away any of the story, I'd just like to finish up by saying Sendak's got a knack for rythem in his writing. His words flow together to create endless beautiful and sometimes frightening images. This is definitely a book for children of all ages to enjoy!"
5,A classic!,My young son really enjoys listening to this book. It's a classic and well worth buying for your children's library.
5,You can't get any better than this...,This is one of the best children's books in modern times. It's fantastic. I still love it even as an adult. I can't wait to share this with my kids.
5,What a Wonderful Classic,"This is my 15 month's old favorite book. Almost every night he pulls it out from a stack of various children's books and carries it to me to read. His and my favorite part is when the wild things ""roar their terrible roars, roll their terrible eyes and show their terrible claws."" I act out the part and tickle him when it comes to the claws. He goes into a giggle fit and can't stop for a few minutes. (So do I!)"
5,A Kindergarten Crowd Pleaser,This book was a daily request from my Kindergarten students. They never tired of Max's adventures and always found something new in the magnificent illustrations. What a wonderful example of the possibilities of a child's imagination.
2,Not a classic in our house,I know this book is legendary in children's literature but my children were not as enthusiastic as I thought they would be when I read it to them (they were close to 6 years old at the time). I was disappointed too. I'm trying to figure out the hype but I just don't get it.
2,wild things,This book is awesome reminds me of when I was a kid growing up. I was so excited to get this book and give it to my friend as a gift but when I opened it from the packaging there were some pages that were bent and ripped.
1,This book is inappropriate for my four year old.,"I don't understand how this book is on the best seller's list. The illustrations are scary for young children. The educational value of this book is very negative. Instead of teaching of self discipline and respect for authority, this book promotes disobedience and violence. I know, for years, it has received glowing reviews. I disagree with all of them. This book entered the trash can the day it entered our home."
2,Damaged goods,"The book was great, but came damaged. I won't send it back because my daughter loves it and it takes too long"
2,No better than others,"I had high hopes for this skimmer. The frame of this skimmer appeared to be made heavier than others I've used, but it didn't hold up. The mesh netting is shallow and lightweight and is not constructed any differently than other skimmers. Bottom line is the frame cracked after using it for an hour or so of pulling leaves out of my pool. Not recommended."
3,Needs specific pole,"This skimmer will not fit ANY pole. It has to have a specific pole to attach. I have a screw end pole that I thought would work, since it says ""fits virtually every pole"". NOT."
5,Great Skimmer,This skimmer fit the bill. We have lots of leaves and it picks them up without a problem. Also made very well and wide so that we can pick up much the first time.
1,Don't waste your money!,"We purchased this for a small kids pool. We have used it for one day, yes, one day and it is already ripping at the seam along the side. Glad we purchased it via Amazon so we can send it back!!:-)"
4,leaf skimmer,"this leaf skimmer works as described. Light weight and easy to use.What I really like is the delivery speed, got it immediately!!!A deeper net would be even better, but really no complaints."
5,Hydro tools leaf skimmer,"This is a large and lightweight plastic rim net which is much cheaper than the metal ones I have been using. When the net wears out just buy another one, the expensive ones wear just as fast."
4,"Nice construction, not fine enough","I will admit that I returned this already, but potential purchasers should know it wasn't because of the quality of the construction. It's got a nice lip, and wide mouth. It didn't concern me that it was all plastic even. But the mesh is not fine enough to use as a surface skimmer, which is why I needed this."
4,Great,I would have given it 5 stars but the handle cracked within the first two days. I had it replaced and it's been working great for the past 3 weeks.
2,Not Impressive,"While some others have rated this skimmer well, I wonder if more recent versions are less impressive. I would not recommend it to others. It holds very little if used to skim leaves from the surface, and it is a real struggle to pick up leaves from the pool floor with this tool."
3,Good but needs small handle,"Skimmer works but the handle we have is too big for it so you can't ""flip"" that things you skim out. Need to purchase a different pole to make it work."
1,Not what I needed,"I have a vinyl inground pool and this tool did not work for me. Instead of scooping up leaves, it stirs them up but the leaves go under it. It just doesn't work for my needs. It is also heavier than the one I replaced making it more difficult to maneuver."
4,good,It's an okay film. Basically a movie about if Arthur Leigh Allen was Zodiac in a Hollywood sort of way. About the same level as Dirty Harry except this cop is dying. It's worth a look.
4,The medal is lovely.,"I like St. Christopher's medals - The blue overlay and black around the edge makes a nice looking medal. The back has a surfer which is a little funky but cool. Now the one star off - the chain is cheap and gave me a dreadful rash. I like the medal enough to replace the ball chain with a cord, so four stars."
3,great content - book fell apart,"I purchased this book last winter and just finished reading it this summer. I was quite disapointed that the book fell apart when half finished. Probably five different sections fell out of the binding. Other than that, it was the best history book I have ever read and I am ordering another copy for my library."
2,Horrible Binding for This Edition,"Sadly, I got through only 80 pages before the binding began to come apart. I would look for another edition from another publisher."
3,Good but not great,"This book offers a specific structure for a Wiccan BOS that also encourages personalization of the BOS. The specific information offered is presented as personal, which is good as the background that would be necessary to assess the material is generally omitted. There is a lot to think about on a topic that is generally overlooked entirely and it definitely creates many jumping off points for research. This is far from a definitive work on creating a book of shadows and fails to live up to its title as it doesn't teach spell composition or writing on many levels, but instead gives some hints and spells. This book doesn't offer the same quality as many of Telesco's books, but it is worth a read. Telesco did a good job with a tough subject, but I am left wishing she had done better."
2,This book was ok...,I didn't especially like this book. I found more information on making a book of shadows with deity's than with folk magic. But it might just be that I don't especially like Wicca and I'm only 10.
2,Oh what a shame,The part of the book that said stuff about spells and spell components was really confusing it sounded like she didn't know anything about spells she didn't tell how exactly to create a spell specificly it was confusing it just boggles my mind that i didn't understand it was a big dissapointment and i need to make a spell because i really want something and i been longing for it and thinking about it and worrying about it and it's a big huge thing that's been botheribng me and making sick and nervous so this book didn't do me any good but i finally found something that can change all my fears and so on etc
1,the worst tfal pots I ever owned,I purchased these pots because I love tfal pots. But I must say I HATE these pots. I got burned by the steam from the lids. The handle on the lids fall off causing the pot to fall. Just terrible pots. I must say Tfal lost me as a customer. I own Kitchen Aid now and love them!!
4,I OWN THIS MOVIE I FOUND IT VERY FUNNY,THE PROMISE OF LOVE AND WHAT SHOULD A WIFE DO TO PUT AN END TO HER TWO TIMING HUBBY. A LOT OF LAUGHS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 4 STAR RATING.
1,IT WAS SO WARPED IT COULDN'T PLAYED,"I had to return this DVD because it was so warped it couldn't be could not be played, and I TRYED THREE DIFFERENT DVD players!!"
3,"Before DiCaprio, there was Phoenix...","I love just about anything that the late River Phoenix is in. The charisma just oozes out of the screen in his films. He has an angelic quality that comes through in his characters. This film is one of my favorites, with River, and in general. His character of Devo, a sweet, offbeat young man with a crush on Tracy Ullman's character, Rosalee, is priceless. Rosalee is married to Kevin Kline, who is cheating on her. She finds out and asks Devo to help her kill him. Of course, Devo will do anything for her. So he hires a couple of spaced out hippies, portrayed hysterically by Keanu Reeves and William Hurt. These two are so incompetant and lame, they can't even knock off Rosalee's husband at close range! What happens next is not for me to tell, but you better be prepared to laugh your self sick. The woman who plays Rosalee's Mother steals the show! (River...I miss you.)"
1,Family,Its my family it was very slandering character wise. Never saw it till now! Never wanna see it again ever!!
4,A real gem for Kline fans,"Mr. Keogh and Maltin don't know what they're talking about. This is a great comedy, whether or not you've got a grudge against Lawrence Kasdan as a certain goateed film critic seems to. Joan Plowright isn't even the best part. The Harlon and Marlon routine is priceless and Tracey Ullman is superb as always. Catch it on Comedy Central if you can."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"I remember one year watching on video all of the top ten films for that year, I remember that I enjoyed one of them. Critics seem to speak to everything except what people really like. This is a film just to enjoy, Kline is at his funniest and the supporting rolls are all actors I love to watch. Perhaps too I see a little of Joey in many of the men I've known and perhaps we all need to know someone who loved us enough to kill us!"
1,I thought it had inappropriate language.,It was very realistic in that it had a lot of father/son conflicts
3,Used Books,"This book was okay. the pages were yellowing and some lines were highlighted, but it was as expected."
3,Mixed,"""Fences"" starts out as a very boring play. The first act almost made me not want to read it. At first Troy Maxson seems like your average guy, but as the story moves along you really start to strongly dislike him. By the end I had the impresssion that he was a greedy, old, money-grubbing man who didn't want anyone to succeed, and was unfaithful to everyone important to him. There is no way that this man should have been, or should ever be trusted. But overall it is a good book."
3,FENCES IS A GOOD BOOK.,"If you have ever read a book called ""Fences"" you may think its a wonder full book , but I think its a good book. This book is not a book in which you think this is one of the best book. I agree that this book is pretty good but I think that the book could have had a better plot to it than it had. This book needs to let us know what happened to Cory one of the main characters in this play. Between this time period we don't ever find out if cory choose to go to the Marines or he just did it because he had no other choice.""Fences"" is a book in which their could of been a better setting and a more interesting plot to the whole book.I think that this book was a good book. It was a slow moving plot book in which everything was a little confusing, but not all that confusing. What I'm trying to let you know is that this is a good book to read and its o.k. to read."
4,"""Fences""by Agust Wilson","""Fences""by August Wilson,was a great book because people can relate to it.In my case I kind of found myself in Corys position because sometimes my dad doesn't give me per motion to go were i want to go.Like when I asked him if I could get a part-time job he said that I would start to pay my own bills and be independent. Troy Maxon is thought as man of the house.Troy struggles to raise his son cory,because Troy wants to educate his son the way troy was raised."
3,Dysfunctional family relationships,"The book was good. I found a few quotes, that reflect that of a dysfunctional family. The attitudes of the characters, and the behavior of the main character was that of a superior attitude to everyone else. The main character displayed an attitude of selfishness."
5,This book relates to all races,"I really enjoyed this book becasue I could feel what it was saying. It really reached out to me and I instantly felt a connection. I could feel the pain that Rose felt in her heart. I did not just relate to this becasue I am black but because the book lured me in with his vivid language. I think that all races can relate to this book, becasue it is so realistic. Our school did a skit where Troy was telling Rose about his baby and again I felt the connection. This is a good book."
3,Fences,The theme of the story was the best part of it. They also used great diolect to create the right setting. The chacters were descired very well and this made for a better story. It wasn't the best play I ever read but it was entertaining. It shows you the every day struggles that a family has to endure. I recomend it to anyone that wants to understand a father son relationship at the time the story takes place.
5,Good reading,My daughter had to read this book as an English class assignment and at times would ask for my input- I had never read any of August Wilson's work -I read the book so that I'd be able to discuss the book with her. I'm really glad I did but a bit sad that I'd just gotten around to Mr. Wilson's work. I enjoyed this book and will make it a point to read others.
3,It was just OK,The play was a short read. It was not great nor was it boring. The main character irked me in many ways and I did not like the way his wife was the stereotypical husband pleasing housewife. On the positive though the story line was amazing and unforgettable though slow at times.
4,apocalypse vs apocalypse,"Primavesi's ecological theology represents the best hope of a Christianity at once justly gendered and sustainably green. Her careful work with scripture allows her to make a stunning and biblically resonant inversion of our linear habits: rethinking the radicality of the apocalypse in terms of the beauty of the creation. She does not perform an apocalyptic denunciation of the apocalypse, but a counter-apocalyptic recycling. A ground-breaking, or more accurately, ground-healing, work."
5,Great castle!,I got this for my son a couple Christmases ago and he is still playing with it at age 10. It is beautiful and easily put together by the child. Great for imaginary play and holds up well. Seems to be best if placed on a play table for easier access and keeping it out of the way (big castle).
5,this is a great book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I had to read it for my history class, and I'm glad this is one of the books he picked for us. I will have my kids read this book when they are older. The history makes you more appreciative, and humble."
3,Auto Mats or Area Rug???,"When the shipment was received, there was a total of 2 mats/rugs. So, I checked to make sure that I wasn't charged twice...I wasn't. The discription states ""area rug"" so why did it get 2? I would have been happy with 1 at 1/2 the price. Was I supposed to get 2 ""car mats"" or did I recieve an extra 1? They measure about 27 inches."
3,"You're Right - Lazy, but Certainly not the Last....","Here we go...another attempt to get a book out in time to sell it before the general public forgets who the subject is. Problem is with that theory is that we have seveal books that are way too much a like. If only one would have covered his chilhood better and paid epecial attention to Opus Dei, both of which I believe had more effect than anyone will ever know. I'd also like to know how an FBI Agent got his hands on all this supposed NSA and CIA information. Even in these days of ""Homeland Security"", these folks just don't share well at all. I think there is/was a middle-man (CIA?) in there somewhere. No way NSA or CIA would reveal info to the FBI, who they consider just to be the Federal police dept with no ""need to know"" anything important of an international nature. The whole thing sounds bogus to me. - Former NSA Employee"
5,Great read with lots of info,The book reads like a spy novel and keeps the reader's interest all the way til the end. It was extremely informative as well as entertaining and very depressing to learn about the inadequacies of the FBI and our intelligence services. A terrific read!
3,Very Interesting,"I was intrigued by the information in this book.I wanted more detail and a clearer understanding. I remember searching for this book and waiting for it to arrive. I was a little disappointed that it was not better, having seen several interviews with the authors.I have found that ""Spy"" by David Wise is a more detailed and better written book. I believe Robert Hanssen and his family cooperated with Mr Wise."
5,Far superior to Bureau and the Mole,Having read both books I have no trepidation in commending this one to readers interested in Hanssen's treachery. The writers were very detailed in their explantions of Hanssen's actions as well as what the Soviets thought of him.The most interesting part concerns the FBI's hunt for a mole inside of the Bureau and the break that led to his capture. A quick and entertaing read.
3,Slow Reading,I have read the other 2 books Bureau and the Mole and The Spy Who Stayed Out of the Cold.I feel that the authors could have done a better job if they had waited for new information.What was written in this book was almost like the others. I intend to read In the Mirror because it will probably have more new information.
3,Not a bad book,"I found the book easy to read. It dwells too much on Hanssen's wife, and not on the details of how he was being watched by the FBI and what was his reactions before the arrest. I also found some factual errors, like calling Rumsfeld the Secretary of State, he was one of the people who wanted President Bush not to follow the advice of Aschcroft for death penalty for Hanssen. I recommend it if you are interested in these genres."
3,Not My Neighbor,"An informative quick read. To say it reads like a Ian Flemming James Bond novel would be a misstatement. Its more like the Pink Panther meets Maxwell Smart. I couldn't believe this guy...a pompus...arrogant...anti-communist...religious zealot loner. Who was he trying to fool? Obviously, the best minds in the spy business .... Who was sitting behind the desk the day Hanson signed up for the FBI?I haven't read any of the other Hanson books but I did read Bob Baer's ""See No Evil."" If you read the two books you will know the answer to the last question. It appears that politics over rules common sense leaving our first line of defense against terrorism and forces of evil vulnerable.Therefore...whether you are liberal or conservative...a civil rights fanatic or a gun-toting anti-commie...you will find this book a must read. You have to come away wondering why it took so long to catch this guy."
1,Lasted 10 min.,Opened the box and within 10 min my boxer had it torn and was pulling chunks of plastic off it.
5,Puppy thrill kills!,"My 3 mo old dalmatian absolutely loves this jack! He attacks it over and over and seems to think he is really accomplishing something by doing so, killer instinct I guess. When I take it away and try to get him to play with something else, he may spend a few moments with whatever I give him but always goes back for the jack and if I have put it up he actually will stare at me and wait for me to put it back down for him to attack! Sound is annoying after a while if in a small room and he's been going at it for 20 or 30 minutes, but outside it is the greatest and keeps him occupied and out of trouble!"
5,Love It,"I love this CD , it was done by a amazing person, Matt White of Pickering,Ontario. Look out for his other CD's. I guarantee you will be begging for more."
4,An absolute must CD for all Malory's fans,Although i bought this CD used it plays very well and also the case is in eccelent condition.Half of the songs are really amazing.Raccomend it for every Malory's fan.
3,It's alright.,"Let me start by saying that protects you from pregnancy - so it's definitely safe. However, I didn't notice that much of a change with the texture. Friends of mine that have used this particular condom said they didn't notice much of a difference, either.Overall, it's good. Not great, but good.^_^"
2,Artist is barely heard on her own record!,"I don't understand what is supposed to be so great about this record.It's one of those suspicious producer-controlled projects that just goes nowhere. There's very little flute-playing, even less singing by Humphrey; in fact, she's little more than a guest star on her own record! Every track is written by Larry Mizell, the producer, whose nepotism in choosing backing musicians is another uncool thing here.There are some great ideas--the use of a male chorus (heard sporadically) is very cool--and the basic tunes here are fine. BUT....each track goes on and on and on until you are checking your watch. If 70's funk/jazz/r&b; can be boring...this is an example."
2,not a bargain,As far as I am concerned this unit was a waste of money. It really only worked fine for about a month or so. The brass is ok on it but i was more interestd in the way it worked which is erratic at best(at least on my unit).
2,Problem with Mounting,"WARNING! This does not come with the U.S. standard mounting plate. I bought this light to replace my old porch light and the screws would not align with the existing screw holes into my brick wall. My old porch light had two wires. This one has four. Probably for the light sensor and control to switch it on at dusk to light. Comes with english, spanish, and french instructions. Perhaps the mounting plate is European. You have to screw on the plate on against the outside wall, then slip the screws through the light base, then into the mounting plate. Unfortuntely you cannot twist the base to line up the screw holes. Could not use at all. Had to go to Home Depot and get a similiar looking porch light. It looks and sounds great but was totally useless to me. Too late to return either. Will end up donating to Goodwill with warning note."
4,Very thought provoking. An eye-opener for me,"There were several scenes in this book that related to me so closely! I think the main scene was where Jadine encountered the woman in the yellow dress and felt ""unauthentic"". The scene in the tar pit was on a similar note as Jadine struggled to free herself from the thick blackness. For me, this book was an eye-opener. I finished the book and asked myself if I was like Nadine; resisting my background. You know, not necessarily looking down upon those who embraced our culture, but somewhat thinking I'd get along better in this society, by being more ""mainstream"". I definitely became more aware of the way I perceive myself as well as others. Now I've begun to question why I would ever resist where I came from. I don't know if this was Morrison's intention, but that's what I took from this novel - a life lesson."
3,Overrated politically correct garbage- glad I didn't buy it.,"Seemingly the criteria for a winning Nobel Prize in literature is to write a book that has no ending. The fact that you can't stop thinking about a book because it has left so many questions hanging in the air does not a good book make. At this the book succeeds admirably. But I'll be damned if I'll suffer through a second reading to figure it out. ""Beloved"" was a much better book. Yeah, I'll admit the book has its moments when a particularly beautiful sentence makes you say,"" I wish I could write like this!"", but all in all I'm glad I borrowed it from a friend instead of buying it. END"
1,The ultimate trial of patience,I dare you to make it through the first 100 pages of this book without wanting to put it down. Such was the trial for me when I read this....arggg...jussttt.. a little more...its going to get better just give it time...too late I quit. The prose are needlessly dense and are in need of heavy editing. Friends that have finished it tell me it gets better near the end....but is the torment really worth it? NO!!!. Ive warned you...this one is a snoozer!!!
2,EHHH,"hoothoot420.I found this book slow untill the middle and end. it wasnt as good as SULA, but it was laright. It is a story about love, abuse, and rascism. the White couple Margarete and Valerian have a son that later on in the novel you find that she abused the boy terribly, she burnt him, stuck him in the behind with pins and cut him. it is a good book, and i spose if someone asked i would recommend it"
1,Lickety-split boring,"Good English skills, worth one star, rambling on in endless and trifle details lead to no conclusions in a mesh of decadent white masters full of caprice and down-to-earth-like-in-roots black servants. The one character that came through believable, is the queen of the soldier ants. Lack of phantasies and an absent talent of spellbinding make it utterly boring to the end, lickety-lickety-lickety split. gerborguta"
4,Filled with honest personal struggles,"In my opinion, this is not Morrison's best work, but the more I think about it after reading it, the more I like it. It starts off slow, but builds momentum as the story and its characters develop. The characters and their struggles are incredibly realistic, and though many have deemed this book ""controversial"" Morrison effectively explores the issues of race and class with honesty and integrity. There are many stories within a story here, and I recommend it to anyone willing to wait out a slow beginning."
4,Didn't understand it all. but liked it.,"OK, I didn't understand all of this novel, but I liked it. Being a 46 year old white male I probably never will undestand it all. How ever, I can report that the character studies of Valerian Street and his wife (""The principal beauty of Maine"") are some of the most devistatingly accurate upper class character studies I've ever read, and very funny in a vitriolic way. This is my introduction to Toni Morrison, and I plan to read more."
2,Not Morrison's Best,"After reading Tar Baby I was left a bit confused and not happy in the least. When you read Morrison, there is a certain caliber that one expects to see and this novel is completely lacking. It had an interesting plot but the characters were flat and uninteresting. Issues are brought up but not explored as they could be. Overall, I was not impressed with this novel. As always, there are beautful parts but certainly this is not her best work."
3,a different Morrison,"Morrison moved outside of the Ohio setting in her novel Tar Baby. She plays on familiar themes of love and identity and sets most of the action in the Caribbean. This is not Morrison's best work in my opinion. It is an interesting novel, but one I didn't have to work so hard to understand. Her reference to the Tar Baby story and its connection to the novel were well paired. I think that this is a wonderful book, an easy read, but having read her previous works, I was a touch disappointed."
2,"not her best book, but okay","I didn't like this novel that much. toni morrison could have had better dialouge. there was too much vulgarity. Yet, the book still had a message that should be a wake up call for most men and womenNot all life experiences are taught to us by the world's system of education ."
4,A Good Read,"Morrison draws us into the lives of her characters and has the reader wanting to know what is going to happen to them next. Her characters are not exceptional people with exceptional lives. We get to peak in on their lives for only a short period. However, it is a time that proves to be disruptive to the order of things in all their lives. The book illustrates how fragile and tentative are our own life stories. A single incident can quickly change the order of our lives."
2,Shower door Handle,I thought that the price was way to high. $28 for one door handle seems a little bit to much. When I ordered the handle I assumed it was a package of two.
4,"My Kid Enjoyed ""No Balloons Today""","I bought this book on Amazon.com after a friend told me her son liked it. My 4 year-old daughter found it very funny and enjoyed the pictures. Because the book revolves around a young boy's trip to the zoo, my daughter always asks to take it along with her when we visit. I have since bought other books by this publishing company (which I found out also come with tapes) and she really liked reading along with the book when the tapes came in. I ordered the other books and taped directly from the publisher [at another website]."
1,Not what it cliams to be,"I read the reviews for this cd and bought it for my husband, however when we got the cd it is not what it claims to be.It is some other cd that has been rebadged and is not Catholic hymns. The name titles even came up different when we went to load it into our itunes library than what it was labeled. We were very disappointed and returned the item."
1,Watch out!,"Be aware that this CD is INSTRUMENTAL ONLY! If you are looking for traditional hymns, this is the ""lite"" version. Sounds like muzak."
3,Easily absorbed,"A pleasing but forgettable collection of instrumentals. (I've really got to start listening to these things before I buy them).I don't find this CD particularly inspiring, but I don't hate it either.It would make a nice singalong CD for someone practicing for the choir, but I prefer to belt out Tuba Mirum without the frustration of a specific key (or melody)."
4,I recommend this product - but...,"OK it is a little pricey but for a unit with both an AC and a DC charger and 4 2500mah batteries included it isn't too expensive. However there are two things that caught me by surprise.1) It will charge up to 4 AA NiMh batteries BUT ONLY 2 AAA NiMh batteries. The design doesn't have a way to insert 4 AAAs.2) The photo at the top of the Amazon page make it look like there is an LED charge indicator for each battery; not so. There are four holes to see if there is a battery inserted, but just one charge lamp. No big deal. Just a bit misleading.Otherwise this product does what I wanted."
2,International for 110 only,"This item would have been great, had we not read that it would work at 110 (USA) and 220 (European) electric current...and we wanted it for travel purposes. Returned unopened! It was convenient to read before opening that the product would not fulfill what was written in the online product description."
5,Battery Charger,"Overall this is a good charger. I like that it can charge both AA & AAA and that it came with 4 AA NI-MH batteries. I also like that it has a vehicle adapter for charging on the go. The only issue I have is that you can charge 4 AA at once but, only 2 AAA at a time."
3,Ok but distracting visuals,"This video provides a very basic background to Google. As mentioned in another review, the visuals are distracting. The editors had about 10% of the actual video footage needed for the narration, and they made up the rest with poorly chosen stock footage. Overall, I was disappointed. I don't think it would hold the interest of a high school class, which was my intended audience."
3,Boring,"I remember seeing a great documentary on the development of the Internet and Yahoo, Google, and others and hoped that this would be it. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Instead of the riveting documentary that I had seen this was nothing of the sort. Bland and boring, the information is alright, but nothing exciting."
5,down memory lane with the little rascals,"Watching these dvd's brought back soooo many memories of my happy childhood.The episodes were so funny and very entertaining,after some of the more hilarious shows were over me,my brothers and sisters would try to reinact them. Like making something to ride on similar to the fire engine the gang made that was falling apart as they went down the street or dressing up to play the part of the many characters they played. I even let my 12 and 13 year old nieces and nephews watch them. They loved it.I also loved that they also colorized them .I definitely suggest these dvd's to help bring back the good old days."
2,The first episode froze.,"First of all there are only five episodes. In my mind, there should be a lot more. I had a problem with the first episode. It froze, and would not play half way through it."
3,3D could be better.,I bought this (even though I already owned it in 2D) because of the 3D release. I am somewhat disappointed in the 3D release. The effect is very mundane. No real depth to speak of. I would stay way from this unless your a 3D fanatic.
1,WHAT? Twenty bucks?,"I've been seeking a soft solid unscented deodorant and can't seem to find them any longer in the stores. For some reason, it appears these types of deodorants have been discontinued in all brands. Does anyone know why? And I would BUY this one, but for the sad and obvious fact that this seller is taking advantage of the dirth of these products still available. I mean, really. Almost twenty bucks for one deodorant? Can we spell R.I.P.O.F.F? Thank you, no. I'd rather go on stinking, just like this seller's conscience."
2,hopper's coppers,"maybe if it had been filmed 15 or 20 years earlier, this dennis hopper directed movie would have seemed revelatory; however, by the time it was made, we had already lived thru several wambaugh books (& adaptations), not to mention ""hill street blues"". robert duvall and sean penn turn in adequate work as the grizzled vet and the callow tyro patrolling the sinister ghetto streets, but the movie never rises above pedestrian."
1,Not my kind of film to watch. Look quick for Mario Lopez,"Almost fifteen years after its premiere, I finally decided to see this film for myself. It is not really my kind of film to watch. It was good to see Trinidad Silva again (May He Rest In Peace). I like Maria Conchita Alonso, but I prefer her performance in THE RUNNING MAN (1987). Why Dennis Hopper chose to direct this kind of film I do not know, but I liked him in NIGHT TIDE (1963). Look quick for a young Mario Lopez. There are no special features nor bonuses on this DVD."
1,Never Received - Still Waiting for Refund/Movie,I haven't received this item. I never received any response from the sellers regarding this Movie nor have I received the Movie or a refund to date. It is September 5th and I purchased it on July 31st.
4,"THE TURF IS REAL IN ""COLORS"".","Dennis Hopper presented an unseen vision of Americana with EASY RIDER in 1969. It unsettled the masses. He did the same almost 20 years later with COLORS, a frightfully realistic look at urban gang warfare in Los Angeles. Hopper has always been a talent, both in front and behind the camera. COLORS could only be handled by the likes of an independent spirit like Hopper: It's tough, brutal, no watered down studio gloss, no techno effects. Hopper is an actors director and Robert Duvall and Sean Penn are a perfect fit. The oft told cop story of the veteran and the novice gets an injection of new life: the partners don't like each other, they tolerate each other for the sake of survival. Duvall and Penn give strong expected performances and the story rifles along free of expected cliches. Ice-T, in his rapper days (pre LAW & ORDER: SVU) is featured on the soundtrack."
4,VHS vs. DVD,"Can anyone provide info on the differences between the DVD and the longer VHS version, which is supposedly Dennis Hopper's cut?"
4,One of the classics,Colors is a classic hood movie. This is the one that still stands the test of time. But what makes Colors so good is that it fouces on the cops and not teenagers as the main characters. Sean Peen is great in the lead as is Robert Duvall as his partner.
3,review of colors,"better than average cops and robbers movie. was given quite of bit of importance that i don't think was deserved, when it was released. well acted movie, with top stars, including Sean Penn (not one of my favorites).i don't know if the writing was the downfall of the movie, or if the film was not put together very well in the cutting room as i suspect. while you watch the movie, you may notice how it seems to jump around a bit (never seemed to have a clear story line), and certain characters are not fleshed out. the best character in the movie is the older police officer played by robert duvall. as much as i hate to admit it, sean penn does justice to the young, gung ho, and vain officer who Duvall's character tries to teach. very good soundtrack, and the opening credits (with Duvall and Penn driving through downtown LA in and unmarked police car) is great. not a great movie, but a good movie that could have been better with some work. a good watch if you like police dramas."
4,Not for children!,"The movie is as expected violent with scenes of sexual activity. For adults that like this type of movie, it fairly reflects the life style of LA gangs. Sean Penn's character is a bit unbelievable during certain scenes. Overall a 4."
3,From the side streets to the smokin grounds of LA's Gangsta',I remember first seeing this movie on one of my favourite t.v. channels and was glued to the tube until the ending which I thought was justified. It's about a hot shot cop ( Sean Penn ) partnered up with a soon-to-be retiree (Robert Duvall). The film shows the two generation splits of the same career held in the same town and how it can have great advantages and disafvantages. They chase thugs around and the hot shot cop falls in love with one of the Chicano's ladies. Anyways this movie displays the fast pace of action and dialogue any underrated movie can offer with two talented actors.
5,olors,"Mayn When I First Saw This FliCK I Was Only 10 Years Old. 13 Years Later Still Bangin'. This Gotsta Be The Best Hood Movie Ta Ever CKome Out. Lettin' All The Simps Know How Gang Life Is. This Is One Of Those Movies Where You CKould Wath Over & Over. Alot Of Funny CKameos In This Film. Damon Whaynes Playin A RiCKett, Gerardo(Rio Suave), & Slatter(from saved by the bell) All Wanna Be Hard Its Funny. Anyways The Movie Is Off The Hook. So A Swoop It And Keep It Gangsta."
1,Beware,"I bought this CD because I am a big fan of Mike Morgan. He's an excellent guitarist. Live he's even better, on stage or in the studio (Blacktop recorded live in the studio--awesome). Well, turns out the CD only gives you part of the songs. Can you imagine? There is nothing in the CD description warning of this either. Who in their right mind would knowingly buy a CD with the songs cut off early or with fade-ins? Only the unaware. Charley Records, if they're still around, should be ashamed of themselves for promoting this farce, and Amazon likewise for perpetuating it through its venue."
4,This is probably the silliest and funniest Bond movie ever.,"I think this movie is quite underrated. Yes, it is sillier and more unrealistic than most other Bond movies, but it's also perhaps one of the funniest. I think it's quite good. It is entertaining all the time and it never gets slow or boring. It's fun to see Jaws (Kiel), from The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), again. In this movie, he's actually speaking. Once.The Austin Powers movies have borrowed and made fun of things from many of the Bond movies, but especially from this one and especially in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999).This is the third time Shirley Bassey sings a James Bond title song. She did it in Goldfinger (1964) and Diamonds Are Forever (1971). It's a quite good theme song. This is not the best Bond movie, but, as I said, I think it's quite good. It's a must-see for everybody who likes the Bond movies or anybody who likes action movies or action comedies. I give it seven points of ten."
4,"Goodhead, Dr. Goodhead, I just can't act.","Rank 11 or 23. Would be 5 stars except Holly Goodhead couldn't act. The bond producers weren't stupid were they. 1977 something from a galaxy far far away inspires a rewrite of a fleming book into a whole new story. Which is just as well, because the best bits from the Moonraker novel were already used in other bond films. This is also the Jaws 2 movie.This is also the bond movie that showed bare breast in the festival scene, but then they cut it. The bond producers were also smart enough to not mess with a formula that did not need cursing and nudity to overcome poor writing, poor imagination and poor directing. I had this Moore movie ranked higher, but I just love some of the post Moore bond movies so it has been sliding down my rankings."
3,Cheesy But Fun,"Watching this movie again after so many years reminds me of why the new Casino Royale is such a great movie. This movie is pure James Bond Cheese. The story is simple. A billionaire has built a space station and wants to destroy the earth. This is a James Bond movie so I guess it won't be a spoiler if I were to say Bond saves the world and gets the girl (her name is Holly Goodhead. I guess they were trying to be more suggestive than [...] Galore) in the end.That's not to say the movie isn't a lot of fun to watch. There are some great sequences, mostly featuring one of the best Bond Villains, Jaws. But, in the end, even he falls in love. This movie will be remembered as the Bond franchise attempt to cash in on the success of ""Star Wars"" as opposed to being one of the best Bond movie. Still ""Moonraker"" is worth a look."
4,Michael Lonsdale is great as HUGO DRAX,People took this movie differently because of that it took place in space and the upsetting return of Jaws. Richard Kiel is okay in this one. I wasn't to impressed with Roger Moores performance. View to a Kill was the worst performance.
1,Not even hilariously bad,"As I popped Moonraker into my VCR, I expected a sidesplittingly hilarious action movie (you know, so inept its funny), but ended up with the exact opposite. I figured Bond traveling into space would be funny, kind of like Battlefield Earth or even End of Days. Moonraker, as it turned out was by far the most boring Bond movie and by the time he made it into space I didn't care anymore."
1,Bond Bombs Out!!,"Don't let the one star rating fool you - this one is a BOMB and the worst serving on offer from the ""McBond"" series (worse still than 1973's L&LD and 1974's TMWTGG combined!!!). After 1977's superb TSWLM the owners of the Bond Franchise dished up this tripe almost as an unintended parody of the series. After a fantastic teaser, M/raker quickly plunges into a quagmire of high farce. Not even Jaws can save this movie from itself. Contains the most hilariously absurd movie scene I've ever seen: Bond wrapping a floppy Boa Constrictor around himself. Unfortunately the snake lost and Bond saved the day yet again (Whooppee!). Worse still, Moore performed his excruciating interpretation of Bond on 3 more occasions."
1,Bond movie? don' t make me laugh,"This is probably the WORST James Bond movie in the series. Roger Moore puns and puns and puns, but does nothing spectacular. It is Star Wars with martinis. Bond was meant to be cold, cunning and ruthless. Not silly, joking and a pansy. Jaws is more of an orthodonist's nightmare than a Bond villain. If you want a good Bond see Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, or any of the UNDERRATED Timothy Dalton movies.... NOT THIS ONE"
2,Bond met Star Wars,"Is that the first Bond film who put him out into the space?check out Star Wars with Harrison Ford or Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker please!! they will entertain ya more & more!The Bond story makes no really sense...the director shot the locations in Brazil, in Venice, in the USA and finally in the space!! the man who played the role of Darth Vader, has changed the name Hugo Drax!PS: only for die hard Bond fans!"
2,If your a true bond fan,"This movie is not worth seeing unless you are a die hard James Bond Fan(Me).Most of the stuff in this goes way over the top:The whole space sequence-had to be the worst scene; way too farfechedToo much comical crap-Roger Moore lacked seriousness in this oneJaws falling in Love-Very wierd (another reason why the move was comical)This Movie had it's good points too:Lots of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, LOTS!!!The wrist watch was coolThe boat chase in mexico was the most memerable sceneThats Really much it for this one. It's only worth seeing if you are a true die hard James Bond fan(ME)."
1,Don't bother,"In a series of painfully absurd Bond films this is the absolute worst. Nothing in this film makes one want to watch it. From the ridiculous acting to the most wooden, unappealing Bond girl ever (even though Lois Chiles is beautiful she's hardly the hottest babe in the film), by way of the most boring Bond nemesis ever, this is completely uninspired dreck.Only one of the usual suspects is at the rendez-vous: beautiful scenery (with yet another visit to the Rio festival). As a bonus you do get a cartoonish appearance by Jaws who finally finds true love with a cute blonde. Ya right!!! If you never watch this film you will miss nothing from the Bond universe and you will have saved 2 hours to do something worthwhile. It doesn't even deserve the few words I have devoted to it. Shame on me!The overall rating of 4 stars for this film shows up Amazon's ratings for what they really are: unreliable and best served with a mound of salt."
1,waste of money,"first of all, Roger Moore is a horrible Bond, this movie has no plot and looks like it came out of a comic strip,special effects are cheesy,and this movie put me and my friends to sleep when we saw it in the movies. If you want a good Bond movie, try Tommorrow Never Dies,or Dr.No.Buy the Moonraker book instead this movie is the worst of all the Bond films."
1,Wow...,"A half-hearted... no, make that quarter-hearted attempt to cash in on the sci-fi craze of the late 70's. Jaws is back. Whoopee. He survives several five-hundred foot falls, and, get this, a re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. Without a spaceship. Roger Moore... sorry, but you're no Sean Connery. The special effects, well, maybe they looked really cool in 1979, but now they look more than primitive. A plot that makes no sense, too much silliness, and the most annoyingly slooooooow motion zero gravity scene ever. Skip it and Live and Let Die. Actually, no. Listen to the first couple minutes of Live and Let Die. Mr. McCarteny's theme song is worth the money paid to rent it. But this pile of... uh... bad stuff? Avoid it like the plague."
5,"""Look after Mr. Bond. See that some harm comes to him.""","Roger Moore takes the 4th film of his to new heights,(literally.)This one of the best 007 fims in the most populat series in the world! The villain, Hugo Drax is plotting to destroy the population of the world from his space station and beginning his master race. The new Bond girl is icy Dr. Holly Goodhead, who 007has to work hard to win her over to his side. Jaws returns to his famous role and has a change of heart ner the end of the film. Directed by Lewis Gilbert for his 3rd and last time. The music is done by John Barry and the fantastic title song is performed by Shirley Bassey. Sadly, the last film to feature Bernard Lee as ""M"", (he died in 1981.) This film is an unstoppable barrel of excitement that takes James Bond from Rio to the forbidden regions of Outer Space! A magnificent film to most dynamically-charged series of all!!!"
3,A fantastical entry into the franchise,"After the success of The Spy Who Loved Me, the producers of the long-running Bond series decided to use one of Ian Flemming's weaker novels to cash in on the Star Wars craze.Moonraker starts off well, with a classic pre-credits teaser where Bond fights Jaws, the steel-toothed villain from TSWLM in a mid-air fight from an airplane. But both the action and plot get too far-fetched by the ending, and the whole thing feels like it's some big-budget Star Wars rip off, which is entirely reasonable. That said, it doesn't try to take itself too seriously, with the humour creating a more comical feel.Humour aside, it fails as a Bond film, for becoming too far-fetched, and Roger Moore, while comfortable in the role, adds a layer of unnecessary goofiness throughout the film, making it an enjoyable, if not quite sensible entry into the franchise."
2,007 Becomes a Live-Action Cartoon,"""Moonraker"" (1979) has little to do with James Bond and everything to do with Looney Toons. The 007 producers have turned Richard Kiel's once-menacing Jaws into Wile E. Coyote. Roger Moore sleepwalks through the whole thing, occasionally stepping aside for the usual plethora of stunt doubles. To be fair, the pre-credit sequence is quite good and Drax remains a truly memorable villain. Otherwise, a definite low point in the Bond series."
3,Not Bad!,"I have only seen two James Bond movie and Moonraker was one of them and I know that a lot of fans of the James Bond movies didn't like Moonraker but I have to say that I liked this movie and I thought Roger Moore was good and so was Richard Kiel as Jaws, the Villain with the metal teeth and I thought that the love story involving his character and that nerdy girl was amusing."
5,For 007 & Space Nerds!,"While not one of the more well known Bonds, this Blu-ray is a must own for any real 007 or space enthusiast!"
3,"Moore is great, the rest of the movie is crap","Roger Moore is absolutly fantastic in this film, but the film itself just sucks. First off, the biggest complaint is the space fight at the end and its terrible lazers. Jaws falling in love..""WTF?"" It was like watching a space version of the spy who loved me. A rich man trying to destroy the world. The only thing good that came out of this is Rogers performence, and this was the last film that Bernard Lee played as M in. God rest his soul."
4,Leave this film alone!,"I wish people would stop crticising this film. There is nothing wrong with it. But no matter how loudly I scream from the rooftops, people just wont accept that this is a good film. Oh well, if you dont like this film then it's your loss."
1,What the hell?,"After the monumental sucecess of The Spy Who Loved Me Pinewood Studious releases this junk. With the desire of sci-fi film in the late 70s they make a sort of sci-fi movie with no sucecess. There is absoulutly no action and dumb villians (except for Jaws) and a stupid climax. I would give 5 stars if this were grading the special effects, they're great. But this isn't grading the effects so be it."
1,This movie is pretty bad,Moonraker was a mistake. I do not reccomend buying this DVD unless you are trying to collect the entire 007 series. Moonraker is an embarrasment to 007 fans everywhere.
3,"Good Book, OK Movie","Moonraker the movie isn't really horrible. I think the filmakers were going for a certain level of camp and light-heartedness (which is really all you can do with Roger Moore-he's not cut out for the intensity Connery brought to the role.) There are lots of cool gadgets, beautiful women, the visually frightening Jaws and pretty good special effects. But if you want genuine Bond action, read the book. It was Ian Flemmings third Bond novel, quick-paced, full of action and less cliched characters. I'm only sorry MGM saved it for the late seventies. I would have loved to see what Connery could have done with it......"
2,James Bond at it's wimpiest.,"James Bond at its wimpiest. In my opinion, not the best James Bond. Roger Moore looks like a tired 007. There is barely any emotion shown in the movie by Moore and it lacks dynamic performances. The film is also a bit disjointed and the plot is not well tied together. Gotta love Jaws though...he is a great henchman! But, there is even a laser gun...Star Wars anyone?"
1,Loved the opening sequence. The rest was just awful,"The thrilling opening stunt and Shirley Bassey title song get you revved up. You expect a good story, with the old James Bond, plus girls, thrills and gimmicks. Instead, you're subjected to a rehash of a plot that echoes OHMSS, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever, a wimpy villain, and the return of Jaws, who in this film becomes a good guy and dates a woman who appears like a mountain maid. If you had never seen a movie before (not just a Bond movie) you might like this crud. Only ""A View to a Kill"" is worse. Devoid of excitement and story."
3,Not Bad,"""Moonraker"" is the most tongue in cheek of the Bond films, but it has some real good action sequences. I don't think it's worse than ""A View to a Kill"" though. In fact, they don't really get worse than ""A View to a Kill.""The plot concerns Hugo Drax, a guy who wants to wipe out world population. This one also features a great boat chase, and one of the best pre credit sequences in Bond movies. Jaws is back, but as Richard Kiel says, ""All these kids wanted him to be a good guy."" So they decide to give him a girlfriend. HOW [sad] IS THAT?The film is nearly rescued by some action, especially the boat chase, the laser fight, and the museum sequence.In my opinion, this is only for people who are die hard Bond fans, like me. Believe me, it's the best of the big bad three (the others being MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and VIEW TO A KILL.)"
4,Secret Agent Spaceman!,"I love Bond's determination in MOONRAKER; there are so many opportunities for him to just give up and go home, but he sticks with it and eventually saves the world."
2,"Moonraker has aged poorly, even laughably.","I had favorable memories of this Bond movie, so I ignored Moonraker's poor showings on various best/worst of Bond movie lists to make my purchase. Purchasing Moonraker was my first mistake, watching it was the second... It was kind of fun to watch and pick apart the lame bits, but it was mostly disappointing."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A pretty silly film that shamelessly tried to capitalize on the space craze set in motion by 1977's Star Wars, Moonraker features a character named ""Holly Goodhead,"" laser fights in space, a steel-teethed villain who falls in love with a nerdy girl half his age, and a villain whose agenda is pretty much the same as the previous Bond villain, but in space not underwater--in a word, pass."
1,The reason they got rid of Moore,"I'm sorry, but this is in no way, shape or form a Bond movie. It is a Roger Moore movie, it has his puns, but lacks the style that makes James Bond the greatest spy of film history. If your image of James Bond is Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan, Moonraker is not for you. focus on the fan favorites of Connery (Dr No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice) and Brosnan (Goldeneye, The World is Not Enough) and you will appreciate the character that is Bond. This movie, this strange, bizarre movie ""Moonraker"" is lucky it never made ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""."
1,Bond at his worst,"I'll admit a bias in that I prefer the tougher, more serious Bond of Connery/Dalton/Craig to the lighter, more tongue-in-cheek Bond of Moore/Brosnan. That aside, Moonraker is ridiculous. It is an absolute disgrace to the Bond series. It takes Bond and turns him into a slapstick comedy character, and the movie is absolutely BORING. I wasn't a big fan of Moore, but The Spy Who Loves Me and For Your Eyes only are masterpieces next to this disaster."
1,EW! This isn't Bond,"Probably THE WORST James Bond movie in history. The movie is a slapstick parody of the series, with a cheesy villain, with probably one of the worst threatening lines in history. ""Mr. Bond, you have the tedious inevitablity of an unloved season."" COME ON! Not even a manaical Bond villain would say that. Plus Jaws would only intimidate an orthodontist. This is one Bond to skip. It is the sheer definition of lame."
1,"The only things good about ""Moonraker""","1) John Barry's first rate film score2) Shirely Bassey's great vocal on the title track3) The fact that the Fleming book wasn't even read by the screenwriters! This allows Eon productions to remake the film as a REAL James Bond movie with Daniel Craig (along with, please God, Live and Let Die and Diamonds are Forever).4) Not as bad as a Pierce Brosnan Bond (pretty bad--but nothing is THAT bad)."
1,History forgot this one because IT SUCKS.,"If you look at the majority of the reviews on the other DVD page, they all complain about this being too campy and too cheesy. Well let those reviews warn you- Bond and space do not match.I'm not going to mention the plot here since it's just plain ridiculous. But this is indeed the third worst Bond movie ever. When Cubby came up with the idea for this abortion, he said something like ""It's not science fiction, it's science fact."" Well if we're supposed to believe that Space in real life is Star Warsish, than this is indeed ""Science fact""- a Turd of one, that is.It's just a complete and utter disaster. A completely inane and stupid plot, a bored looking and sweaty Moore, a cheesy-as-all-hell final fight, this all equals an incredibly cheap and cheesy Bond that's disgusting and just plain awful. And what was with the ""Bondola""?In short, just avoid this one. Time abandoned this movie because IT SUCKS."
4,Moonraker,"Another 007 movies I have'nt seen in a long time. I'm collecting them and now only have about 6 more to go. This is a good movie, even though I'm not a fan of Roger Moore. I recommend."
4,What the?,What the heck is up with the cheesy music that always seems to be in the Roger Moore 007 films? The boat scenes in this movie are very good. How does Jaws survive? Jaws almost dies five times in this movie!
5,007 in space!!!,"During the late 70s, Space movies were a big hit so not to be outdone, MGM decided to send James Bond where he has never been before....space.The original Moonraker novel is about intercontinental missles but the movie adapation ditches the missles for space shuttles. After a space shuttle is stolen from a 747, James Bond is sent to investigate its disappearance and travels to America, Italy, Brazil and finally space. He also uses a laser gun that is never seen in the series again but it was during the Star Wars craze so it is forgiveable.The blu ray has a good transfer and the details do stand out, you can see the shine on Jaws' metal teeth and the final battle in space is nice, good sound and hip 70s soundtrack, it is amazing to see all the sights and product placements (7up) and while the movie can be dated at times, it is still fun and Roger Moore's swagger plays out well during the film.It is a good movie and reasonable priced, a must for Bond fans."
3,"""Looks like he's attempting re-entry.""","The first twenty minutes are among the best in any 007 film but once the movie gets to Venice it becomes the most expensive comedy since IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD. Costing $35 million in 1979 it would go on to gross some $200 million world wide. Jaws is brought back, this time with a love interest. Roger Moore takes Bond where no spy should go (outer space) , Lois Chiles (whom Moore personally did not like) as femme fatale Holly Goodhead (don't blame Ian Fleming for that one), Michael Lonsdale (the original DAY OF THE JACKAEL) as Sir Hugo Drax. John Barry returns to do the score. Terrific sfx by the late Derrick Meddings."
5,played great,mailed in great time. and great packageing. got it to add to our 007 collection. played great. was in new packageing.
4,A BOND that fit right in with the times.,"The year 1979 was a big year for science fiction. Eager to cash in on the continuing success of STAR WARS, MOONRAKER went all out for a taste of that sci-fi fun, and what fun it was! This is my second favorite BOND after THUNDERBALL.It was great to see Jaws again in this one. The plot and the villian are just as implausible as any other BOND movie before it, but you presume to check your intelligence in-at-the-door before you watch any BOND movie, so hey, why not? This movie also introduced the space shuttle design to audiences before it officially lifted off for the first time in 1981.In a year that also saw ALIEN, THE BLACK HOLE and STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, MOONRAKER fit in quite nicely."
3,Been done before,"This is a good Bond movie, but it has been done before about 2 years before in The Spy Who Loved Me. Same story different location. Moonraker is in space Spy was under water. Why make the same movie twice in a row. It even has some of the same people in it (Ex. Jaws). But its not all bad good effects, but thats about it. Clearly brung about because of Star Wars."
3,moore got better,"I am tired of the reviewers and other bond fanatics missing the main and most important fact about bond other movie franchises. The first fact being A. Roger Moore git better in the role. Notice in the scene where he is spun around the gravity chamber, he says nothing after stopping the machine, no puns , no qurky looks just raectung emptionally to nearly being killed. The film is too corny by far and bringing back jaws was a mistake. Moore still looks good as bond, This was the lsat film he looked younger than he was (52). Lois chiles is the perfect idependent woman agent, After the spy who loved me and BARBRA bACH WELL.. Roger moore worked for twenty five years as an actor and model before he became James Bond. He earned that role.. Show some more respect fellow movie fans"
2,Marred By Silliness,"The first of the truly tainted Moore entries isn't so bad for the first half and the Venice scenes look great in this restored version with all the terrific extras standard for the series. But you'll be rolling your eye's for the rest of it. Did people ever think the souped-up gondola and the Close Encounters jokes were funny? Pity, as this was one of the best of the books."
2,Never really takes off.,"The general feeling that I get from watching Moonraker is that it never fully gets off the ground. As with all of the Bond films there are some redeeming qualities, such as: the opening sequence where the space shuttle is hijaked, the boat scene in which Q supplies Bond with a high powered and lethal boat, and the scenery in and around Rio De Janero. Unfortunately this is not Roger Moore's best performance as Bond, the film really suffers from a lack of energy in many of the scenes, Roger Moore is my favorite of the Bond's but in this one he appears to be on cruise control. Though this film did well at the box office, I would rate it in the lower echelon of the series. The outlandish story and action sequences in the end of the film were addressed in the follow up to this movie ""For Your Eyes Only"" which I consider to be one of the very best of the series, where the film was committed to credibility and more down to earth."
2,Bond Falters...,"Corniness and Sci-fi battles are included in this entry into the Bond series. Roger Moore comes back as James Bond, 007, and he must pursue the head of a computer company named Drax. He has a boring name and does manage to be boring throughout the movie, absolutely listless until the moment he dies. Jaws is back, which can be seen as bad or good. The villain, who seemed so original and cool in Spy Who Loved Me, is merely a distraction here, he is only in a few scenes and none are memorable. Plenty of gadgets and special effects, though, which keep this from having no redeemable value. There was little here to keep me watching, except I noticed the door tone on the apartment is the same as in Close Encounters. Really, if you are a Bond fan, do not buy this movie."
2,Probably the worst Bond film,There is no element in this film that establishes the character Ian Flemming created. The producers sold out (in result almost destroying the franchise) in attempt to try to top the money Star Wars made in 1977. All of the special effects didnt prevent me from falling asleep half way through the movie.
5,Great Bondmovie,"What's left for me to say. Mr Paul Joyce says it all in his review. This is a great film with a good plot and great locations. One thing a must say is: Stop the silly complains about Roger Moore being tired and uncommited. I think Roger Moore hold on with grace a lot better than Sean Coonery did as James Bond 007. I really love Sean Coonery as James Bond but if there's one Bond that got tired it's definitely Connery. I think his acting is tired in his last two Bond films ""You only live twice"" and ""Diamonds are forever"". It's a huge difference compared to his burning, exiting performance in Thunderball two years earlier. In Connerys first four films you really felt that he is Bond. In his last two it feels like he's just doing it like a rutin. Like a job. A little slide from the subject here but like I said; Read Paul Joyce's rewiew, it says it all."
3,inuyasha!!!godzilla!!!!Dragon ball Z!!!bond!!!fan,silly but fun movie i like it that jaws turned good! the last one was better
2,Moonraker,I thought this film was one of Roger Moore's worst films. It was just an excuse to copy the greatness of Star Wars. I would highly recommend The Spy Who Loved Me over Moonraker.In this James Bond film 007 goes against Hugo Drax and Jaws. He meets a scientist at one of Drax's labs. He goes up into space for the last 30 minutes of the film (the only time in space). I did not like this film very much.
4,Moonraker The public attacking Richard Kiel as Jaws,"This bond film is great. I personally loved it. There is one problem. The return of villianous Henchman Jaws(Richard Kiel)""the steel tooth Giant"" or often referred to in this movie a comic embarrisment. Jaws was good in this movie he presented his part very well. I know its a little corny at the end when he has wine with the girl. He wants to add flavor to his movie. As you know He is very scary and he wanted to show you that he could be funny. This film is great. Jaws and Drax vs. James and Holly is a great team. I hope Jaws returns in the next 007 film."
1,gotta be the worst,"I Like Every Roger Moore Film Exept for this one, who in the world would want to like this film? I actually think it's the worst bond film ever. The thing i dislike the most about this is Hugo Drax, the worst bond villain of them all. Holly Goodhead is just a misrable bond girl who dislike's bond. If i wanted to watch this movie again, it would probably be next year. Also Jaws turning into a good guy is a stupid idea. You can stuff this film, because there's nothing good about it."
2,"Gadget-heavy, low-water mark for Roger Moore","The year was 1979 and America had rediscovered its fascination with laser guns and space battles, courtesy of ""Star Wars"" a couple of years earlier. This movie is clearly intended to ride that wave.This movie relies too much on its visual effects and gadgets and is missing the intrigue and intelligence that marks the better Bond pictures. This movie also takes the prize for most egregious product placements. Defintely Moore's worst outing, who would have known he would come back for his best two years later in ""For Your Eyes Only.""Bond fans will want it to complete their collection, others may want to pass it by."
4,One of the best Bond films ever made,I think that this is a very good film. I disagree with the people that think this isn't a good movie. The characters are convincing and well portrayed and the effects in the film are the best since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film is also worth watching because it's Bernard Lee's last appearance in a Bond film.
5,It was a present.,"Christmas! But living in America! Seen it loads, but still a cool film. Typical Bond stuff, but that is what you want!"
4,James Bond - Moonraker,"It is hard to rate any of the James Bond movies, I like most of the early Bond movies with Sean Connery and Roger Moore."
4,Lighten Up and have a martini!,"Yes, MOONRAKER is an over-the-top way out there Bond adventure with gadgets and girls, and little coherence -- why does the villan Drax do any of what he does(? ). But exactly why do you like James Bond in the first place? This was basically a fun romp, and I hardly think it qualifies as THE WORST of the series. The score is up to par, the locations are great, and Lois Chiles heads up the bevy of babes! 007 adventures always mirror the times, and this one is the high tech salute to CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and STAR WARS! I say lighten up on the criticism and come along for a ride on the MOONRAKER. And besides it was MAJOR source material for the moon sequence in THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, so you have to see MOONRAKER to get some of the jokes in that movie."
5,Excellent everyday carry knife!,"I was searching for a good quality, made in USA, everyday carry knife. I think I found it in this SOG Flash I TiNi. Overall quality seems excellent. The assisted opening is easy and wicked fast. The blade has a great edge. However, I am unsure where the knife was actually made. There are no markings on the knife or the packageing to indicate the country of manufacture.Pros: Fast & easy opening from either right or left hand. Pocket clip can be installed on either side of the knife (requires hex tool).Cons: Although the size is nice for everyday carry and concealability, it feels almost too small in my hand. I am considering purchasing a Flash II for its larger size."
5,Perfect,This knife has been more than handy since the day I received it. It is very light and easy to carry. I always have it on me at all times. The feel is very solid even though the handle is plastic. Everything about it seems just about right to carry on you all times. Just ordered the FlashII because the FlashI was just too good.
2,Dog flash I,"Not what I expected. The knife is nit like it's bigger brother the SOG flash II. Not worth the money, I would get the Flash II or a Cold Steel knife. The seller was very good and delivery was on time. No issues there"
5,"Great EDC, Lightweight, very hidden, quick 1 hand operation!",Pros:Very Light weightQuick deployEasy 1 Hand operationDual thumb studClip can be changed to both sidesSharpGreat Safety lockCons:Little spendyLock rattles while blade is closedOverall a Great everyday carry knife!
4,Almost Perfect,"Knife is a good size - maybe another 1/2 inch of blade and handle would be an improvement. Blade is SHARP, attractive, comfortable and light.Recommended"
4,Great little knife,Works well for light duty use and is very small to carry in casual slacks or pack. Easy to keep sharp.
5,Great little knife,I bought this knife as an every day carry knife and its is one of the best knifes i have ever used. its small and super lite weight. the blade is sharp and holds an edge. the knife is quick to deploy and can be opened and closed with one hand. the safety is a great feature i don't use it much except when the little ones are around and i leave it on a table. my only problem if you can call it that is the locking lever (little gray button in the picture) can make a little noise when the blade is closed its hard to hear when its in your pocket but wen its out like on your belt it can be clearly heard as it moves while you move. its not really a big deal but i hate making noise when i walk. but its a great knife and i carry it every day
4,small knife,"Don't be fooled, this is a SMALL knife. It is well built and operates well but is small. Once in my pocket I don't even notice it. I have large hands and it is almost too small for me to operate easily. I don't have a problem using it but a little more real estate on the handle would have made this knife much nicer to use for large hands. Not a bad knife for the price, but its not a bargain."
3,Feels cheap,"Feels cheap in the hand. Ultra light, sharp blade. Might be a perfect knife if weight is your goal. Clip is also pretty bad."
3,I THINK THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BETTER.,"ONLY PURCHASE THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE A PIMP/HO FANATIC. I READ FROM PIMPSTICK TO PULPIT IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS AND WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. I THOUGHT THAT ""MAGIC"" WOULD HAVE GONE INTO MORE DETAIL GIVING THE READER MORE VISUALS AND DETAILS ABOUT THE PIMP LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BEAT HIS HO'S, HOW DID HE PENETRATE HIS HO'S MIND, OR WHAT WAS HIS LIFE WAS LIKE ON A DAILY BASIS. I FELT HE GAVE AN OUTLINE OF WHAT HIS SO CALLED PIMP LIFE AND IT'S SOMEWHAT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT HE IS NOW SAVED. HE DID NOT SAY HOW HE HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO GOD AND HOW HE MAKES HIS MONEY NOW. WHY WOULD A SAVED, NATURAL MAN OF GOD STILL PUT A PERM IN HIS HAIR? MAGIC IS STILL A VAIN MAN FROM THE PIMP WORLD WHO HAS A NEW HO. THE CHURCH. THIS HAS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT HE IS PIMPING THE CHURCH, BIBLE, AND MEMBERS OF HIS CHURCH WITH RHETORIC. IF YOU CHOOSE TO READ THIS BOOK, BORROW IT FROM A FRIEND OR GO TO THE LIBRARY."
3,Not all manipulation,"I just wanted to say yes this book could have been better. The pimp game is not all about manipulating a weak person's mind anybody can be broken. Educated or no education at all, Its all in how you implement your efforts. Its not worth buying the book."
1,An Ugly Account,"The one thing I learned from this book is that the pimp/prostitute relationship is not about sex or money. It is about a vicious form of non-consentual sado-masochism. The books consists primarily of a tedious series of brutal beatings and humiliations. If this is the kind of thing you enjoy reading I suggest the Marquis de Sade, his prose are more lyrical, and his accounts challenge the status quo.In ""From Pimp Stick to Pulpit"" there is scant attention paid to the subject's conversion and no reference to a pulpit, or to the consequences of his actions prior to, or after, his acceptance of Christ. The book does communicate well the human side of each of the characters, but in the balance all are found wanting.The book characterizes the mack life as one of glamourless, degenerative moral and intellectual decay - and I don't mean that in the good way! The mack life is painted as a drug-induced haze of paranoia, manipulation, and defeat."
4,gift item,"This item was given as a gift to a friend, who specifically requested it, and expressed great satisfaction on receiving it. Pricing, delivery and product integrity were all satisfactory. My rating it a 4 out of a possible 5 reflects only the fact that I lack first hand experience with the purchased item, and can only reflect the limited information conveyed to me by its recipient."
4,Respect,"After reading this book I don't agree with his methods, but must respect the results he acheived and the fact that he could convince his sister to write the book. Aspiring pimps should note that he retreated and became a 'scholar' of the game before he actual started pimpin'."
3,It was ok,"I don't really remember what made me want to read this book, I surely was in for a shock though to see how a pimp lived. This book is told through the eyes of Ann Bromfiel who's DOn Juan big sister. Don Juan beats the women who work for him, yet they all still love him, that's what went on through the hold book. He all of a sudden turned saved in the last chapter, which is good. If you want to see how a pimp live, you can find out a lot from this book"
4,Good Quality Cart Wheel's,The Cart Wheel's were of great quality. the service was quick and efficient. There were no problems would order again
3,Gleason Wheels,"I bought this wheel to replace a broken wheel on a Rubbermaid Garden Cart. I saw it advertised (on another website) as an exact replacement. However the inside diameter of the bearing is a little to large for the Rubbermaid axle, making the wheel wobbly. I used some 1/2"" electrical conduit as a sleeve and it works fine. I like the fact that the tire is solid and doesn't require inflation."
3,Tons of Stats,"If you're into archiving NFL stats, buy this book. There is a ton of information and facts for '06 as advertised, and it's a good gift for your local NFL nut."
1,"Facs in 2006 book are mostly from 2005, not all-time facts.","I never purchased a sports statistic book before, so maybe that's why I am so disappointed. I thought the book would have team roster histories and year-by-year summaries, but it mostly summarized the 2005 season. The book has plenty of 2006 info, including team front office management, roster, schedules, draft info, and coaching staff bios. The historical data includes extensive team info, but only the significant individual records/stats. Boiled down, nothing more than the 2005 USA Today NFL sports pages in one book."
4,Fine purchase,No complaints except an initial email query never was responded to. The book arrived though without any hassle or other remarks.
5,#1 Sean Connery Bond Film,I'm a major fan of Bond and this is my favorite Bond with Sean Connery. The graphics wre good for a movie fom that era and any Bond fan should see it.
5,BOND IS BACK,"2nd screen outting of the master spy. Terence Young once again directs. Sean Connery SENSATIONAL as ""BOND"". BEST in the movie series. Even has a cameo appearance by pre-""GENERAL GOGOL"", Walter Gottel."
3,Bad storyline,"I felt that the storyline in this film was to simple. The storyline should have been more elaborate. The back of the case describes the plot with little detail. If you get ""The Connery Classics"" versions they come with a animated episode of ""The Pink Panther"". The pink panther episode on this tape is ""In The Pink Of The Night""."
3,OKAY ON ITS OWN,"On its own, From Russia With Love worked as a straight spy adventure. But note that it wasn't until GOldfinger that Bond really took off. If all the films follow FRWL's format, Bond would NEVER be as big or long lived. If you have seen all the films that came after Goldfinger, From Russia With Love will be disappointing, and BORING! BUt I have to say that everytime Lotte Lenya shows up, the film sizzles from her villainy. Great leading lady in the form of Daniela Bianchi. But as I said, the film can be at times boring if you are used to the later Bond films...especially when they board the train. As I said before, on its own, it is okay. But compared to the later films, it is a borefest."
5,James Bond in the european taste !,"Many people consider this work as the best of Bond series . And to me it has very interesting and enriching issues that makes it totally apart from the others .The locations in Istanbul are gorgeous ; The presence of outstanding actors such Pedro Armendariz and Lotte Lenya the wife of Kurt Weill as the unscrupulous villain plus the ravishing and statuesque Bond girl Daniella Bianchi my third choice behind Claudine Auger and Sophie Marceu makes another winner point . Besides there is a human sight all around the film and even it runs slow paced in many moments and lacks of the accustomed kinetism, the highlight aspect to remark is its deep realism .Worthable film , though ny favorite film of Bond is Goldfinger and Thunderball this work is to me the third in the list of the great Bond series with the best Bond ever ; Sean Connery ."
5,The best,From Russia with Love was Sean Connery's best movie and the best in the series.It is very faithful to Fleming's novel unllike the travesty Moonraker.Buy this.
5,007 at his best,"This film almost tied with 'Goldfinger' as my favorite, but it won. An awesome plot that keeps you enveloped to the simplistic, expected, but very good ending. Sean Connery alone is reason enough to read this book."
5,Simply the best bond movie,"It has been said before, but I'll say it again - Sean Connery IS James Bond. With that out of the way, why is this the best? It has one of the tightest scripts of the series and good supporting cast throughout, but it boils down to two things; or really, two villains (it always comes down to the villains, doesn't it). Lotte Lenya is chillingly creepy as Rosa Krebs, one of the greatest Bond villains ever. And Robert Shaw is magnificent as the bull-necked, dead-eyed killing machine. His fight with Connery in the train is maybe the most thrilling unarmed fight scene I have ever seen in a movie (okay, except for Bruce)."
4,One of the best OO7's,"From Russia With Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service are highly recommended.Also, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and Dr No are good.Skip all the Roger Moore/Timothy Dalton efforts-not worth the trouble.Daniel Craig's are also good and a necessary modernization of the franchise.So with seven of these Bond's you've got the best of OO7 for a whole lot less money."
4,"Girls,Guns, and Gadgets!","Although ""Dr. No"" was the first 007 movie, this is the film that started it all, girls, guns, and gadgets. This film is the first debut of ""Q"" and is the only film where 007 and Q dont bump heads which is common in all the other films. This is a classic Bond film with ""Spector"" back to create havic in the world. This movie starts many of the bond immortal icons, face-less vilans, tons of evil hench man and women, fancy gadgets and Bonds power over his women. Classic scenes like the helicopter chase on the mouintain and the train fight between bond and his assasin are just the beginning of this unforgettable Bond film, which started it all for the 007 collection. A true spy flick and one of Connery's Best performances."
5,From Russia With Love [Bluray] [Steelbook],The Steelbook Edition's of The James Bond Movies in Terms of Picture - Sound and Content are the best yet.They are of Course the same Editions as the Standard Bluray Release in the Plastic case.The only Problem is Will they be Releasing the rest of the series in Steelbook or are the 9 we have so far all we're going to get?
5,This was a must see Bond Film,"This was the One Bond film for all ages. Complete with action, love, humor, villans, and gadgets, this was a success for Bonds."
2,Change in franchise overt for newcomer,"As a relative newcomer to the James Bond franchise (since 1996) and a lover of the later films, I read all the very high reviews of this movie as ordered it without hesitation. However, it is very jarringly different than the last 15 years's worth. I found myself laughing at the outdated special effects, the western-style gunfights and the glimmer instead of glamor. It actually felt campy! WIth no offense to the legion of people saying this is one of the best Bonds of all time, for most people born after 1980, this is a skip."
1,This series deserved better.,"It is hard to imagine that only the 2nd 007 flick would be one of the worst, but this one is just so horrible! The romance plot is laughable and badly acted, Connery and Bianchi don't even have any chemistry. A ton of scenes in the film don't make any sense either--- the gypsy camp sequence for instance. It has NOTHING to do with the plot, yet a good deal of the film is spent here. It's almost as if the filmakers had 2 scripts, couldn't decide between the two, and just used them both, resulting in one huge convoluted mess. Perhaps this was because they were trying to get the movie out in only a year after Dr. No came out. A shame--- had they given FRWL more time and not rushed it, it could have been something really good."
1,Absolutely Dreadful,Whatever You do do not get this Film. This is the worst Bond Film. There is 1 good fight. The films worse the on Her Majestys secret service! Record it on the TV( you have missed it because it was on the Connery season which ended 2 weeks ago)
4,Second Bond Film Doesn't Disappoint,"Sean Connery returns to the role of 007 in the second film of the series. I won't give away too much of the story, but this film features excellent plot and dialogue with some swift action sequences squeezed in here and there. The movie is primarily set on a train traveling through Europe, so if you are looking for some of those exotic locales from other Bonds, this might not be the one for you ..... However, it is excellent nonetheless. Many critics call FRWL the best Bond in the series, but i disagree. I tend to like several films such as Goldfinger, Thunderball, Live and Let Die, and a few others more than this one simply because, although less realistic, the villains are more menacing, the sets more varied, and the schemes more creative.I do give this film credit for probably having the most down to earth and realistic plot in the series, along with For Your Eyes Only."
5,PNE OF THE GREATEST FILMS!,"""From Russia With Love"" is not just one of the greatest Bond films, but one of the greatest films in genral. The villan, Red Grant, is truly the most lethal in the series. Connery gives an amazing preformance as 007. The harrowing scene on the Orville Express is truly the greatest in movie history. The gadgets are the best, and the Bond girl is outstanding. My favorite!"
5,Possibly the best 007 movie ever!!!!!,A good movie with Dr.No ranking up some good reviews. From Russia With Love got a lot of good reveiws. The point is I don't get why it seems longer then it really is? Any how you'll love this movie all the way to Russia! SO GET IT NOW!!!
4,"""Old man"" and Identical brief cases save the day!","4.5 stars This was an amazing followup to Dr No. James gets &#65533;killed&#65533; in the beginning, goes to get a decoder, gets 2 gypsy&#65533;s and ends up on the great train ride. In the end, greed and identical brief cases save the day. This was also a very good Fleming novel. I rank it 7 of 23."
3,Bond is on it's way,"Another great re-master! From Russia With Love, has the feel of Dr. No with an extended color palette, exotic locations, an interesting villain in strong man 'Grant' played by Robert Shaw, who is great in a suspenseful train scene. There are a lot of nods to Hitchcock in this movie, which I suspect are unbeknownst to the filmakers; they were probably put in there on a subconscious level; but I noticed. I like the pacing of the action and Connery is in fine form. This film gives us an idea where the Bond films are headed and it's an exciting ride."
2,Widescreen?,I agree with most reviewers that From Russia With Love is one of the best Bond movies but I was very disapointed that contrary to the cover claiming that it was a widescreen version it was full screen. I have the Criterion laserdisc which is widescreen and although the laserdisc is supposedly lower in resolution than the DVD I believe the laser is better. The extras with the DVD are nice but the screen format was a BIG disappointment! This refers to the 007 Volume 3 DVD which I assume is the same as the one listed here.
4,One of the best Bonds ever,"This is an outstanding, if dated, movie. I hitchhiked a good 10-15 miles from Calabasas to Thousand Oaks to see it in first run with my greaser friend, Steve Levine, 50 years ago (in those days in Southern California you were either a greaser or a surfer. I was a surfer, he was a greaser. Yet we were pals). It was sexy and scandalous then. These days its stuff is sorta tame. But the story is everything, and this is a great story. It's also well-shot, and has one of the best fight sequences ever filmed. It came out just before Bond mania hit. It is sort of the early 60s equivalent of the beginning of the Harry Potter phenomena. I highly recommend it and am proud to have it in my library. It is one of my go-to films for when I want to watch something I know to be worthwhile."
5,007,I love 007 movies especially the ones with Sean Connery. Out of all the Bond men Sean Connery is my very favorite. I only need to get 4 more to get all that's been made so far.
4,Simpler Spies,"I got this for personal reasons, but I think the earlier Bond movies were more relatable; by this I mean you could actually imagine most of the gadgets existing. Busty women and hard-fighting gutsy guys; what's not to like?"
4,Brilliant,"Arguably the best Bond film ever. This movie epitomises everything a Bond SHOULD be. The series started nosediving after this (although Goldfinger was quite good). Connery is at his charismatic and rugged best.Shaw is a great henchman, second only to Oddjob. Connery and Shaw provide one of the best fist fights in cinematic history. Hopefully with Brosnan the Bond movies can hit these heights again."
5,Connery is grand,"this one is a razzle dazzle Bond movie, the best of Connery's is my choice. the best bit is when bond fights Shaw on the train, you gotta love that moment and also when Bond is dodging helicopter bullets. fun all around and it kicks majot ass man. considered to be the best"
4,Soulmate,First of all this is not a movie. It's a documentary about single peoples view on being single and those who openly speak about their need to want to get married. It is well put together. I definitely recommend getting this.
3,Documentary,"THIS IS NOT A MOVIE. It is a documentary about why African American women are not getting married, how they cope with it and deals with the primace that the more educated an African American woman, the less likely she is to get married. The women in the documentary are BEAUTIFUL and successful. Women are going to have to exercise their options with other races and cultures (except Africans). It also talks about the lack of unavailable/ overlooked black men."
3,"Interesting points raise, but...","If you are open-minded and can disregard the majority of the preachiness that this video has in it...then I suggest you take a look.However, if you are not a DEVOUT Christian...in the stereotypical sense of the word then don't purchase this video. The majority of the interviewees are from the same demographic, meaning they work in the entertainment/publishing/motivational speaking fields. Most of the women, if not all, were highly educated.However, I didn't know I was in for a lecture on celibacy. I think the preacher who spoke about what women have to relinquish if they were to get into a relationship was very insightful. But the women were not representative of me nor of any of my friends.I gleaned from this video my own interpretations and it had nothing to do with religion. But it helped me to see that I'm not alone in this world of Single Black Woman.I would give this DVD 2 1/2 snaps!"
5,What A Blessing!!!,"This documentary is truly a blessing. After watching and listening to Christian women discuss openly their desire for a husband and their journey it was a true eye opener. It really helps you to realize that GOD's time is not our time regardless of how beautiful, smart, or talented you are. What we want and what GOD wants may be 2 different things. This movie is a must see."
2,Don't buy used,Don't buy this used. Neither of my dvd's could play it because of the scratches. I was very disapointed that I had to send it back.
1,Very Disappointed,"This movie wasn't at all what I expected. It's more of a documentary, not a movie with a story line. It was about a study of single christian women and each one of them discussing their problems and/or joys of being single and trying to live a christian life. It was a group discussion, sort of like a therapy session. Not worth the money."
2,Same old stuff,"This documentary is for single older ladies only. Not very interesting...it just stated the obvious. With the exception of the author, she gave really good advice. I am married but I have had this same conversation with every single woman I know. Everybody knows if you play around in your 20s: dating jerks, being selfish, spend most of your time career chasing or basically not taking yourself serious there is a good chance that you will be single in your 30s and 40s+. I do think it is absolutely heartbreaking and truly unfair that sometimes black woman have to pick between being highly educated/independent/successful or finding a man. But unfortunately that's just the world we live in. Maybe one day that will change for our daughters. In summary I think there are good black man, you just have to know when to ""hold them & when to fold them""."
3,LOOK TO GOD YOU WILL NEVER GO WRONG!!!!!!,"This dvd is ok I'm not that happy with it, the price wasn't bad and the story line sounded like it would be something I would want to watch but not so it has too much talkin for me, I haven't even finished the movie I only lookd at the first 45 minutes or so and not sure if I will look at the rest, Im sure I will find someone else to give it to."
1,Help!,"I received this dvd today and had been very excited about watching it. But when i loaded it into my dvd player, it didnt work and came up with a message ""wrong origin""Can anyone help? How can i get to watch the dvd, im so unhappy now :(Ive given it 1 star as i cant view it!!"
4,Different Perspective,"I enjoyed watching the movie. It just helped confirm my choice of living the best and greatest life possible. Some things that I want to happen, such as marriage and a family might not happen. So what do I do? Get upset or get to living and creating depth within my life and others that will be an inspiration? Never stop loving and living your life because you are not married or have not found your soulmate. This gives me peace to surrender and to stop worrying if he will show up or not."
2,A DOCUMENTARY- NOT A MOVIE,"HATED IT. I do not buy movies to hear people talk about their life, making a documentary. I thought it was a movie and description did not make that clear."
2,documentary,"from the look of the cover, i was expecting a suspense movie, but its a documentary. very informative though. i would rent it not buy it"
3,Informative but Boring,"I wish I had know that this was just a documentary. I thought this was a movie. So, that was the disappointing part for me. However, it was a little informative."
3,Daaaaaaa... It's a good album.,"Like most o Marillion output, this is a very good album. Some people say it's commercial, but it's not. It has a smoother approach, but it's not pop. As for the bonus disc, I don't give a damm about demo versions, acustic versions or whatever."
2,TOTALLY DISPOINTING ...,"It's a shame this album is without inspiration, so below Marillion standards ... Let's face it: after Fish left, MARILLION tried bravely to goes on eith another singer, and the first release with him was barely tolerable .. But this ""HOLIDAY"" seems another band, nothing to do with Marillion. It's the worst kind of thing ""progresive rock"" cand eliver."
3,CAN'T RATE THIS ANY BETTER THAN THE FIRST FOUR,"I RATE THIS CD AVERAGE BECAUSE IT IS AVERAGE - SOME GOOD MATERIAL, BUT DEFINITELY NOT COMPARABLE TO THE FIRST FOUR MARILLION CD'S - A COMMENT TO THE PREVIOUS REVIEW (JOHN FROM BALTIMORE MD) - HOW CAN YOU RATE THIS CD BETTER THAN FUGAZI? - NO WAY MAN - ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT THAT MOST OF YOUR REVIEWS ARE GOOD - FUGAZI IS A SOLID CD - NOT THEIR BEST, BUT BETTER THAN ANY OF THEIR POST-FISH CD'S - HOLIDAYS IN EDEN JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT MARILLION SOUND THAT MADE THEM A GREAT BAND"
4,Not as bad as everyone wnats you to believe.,"Marillion's second Hogarth-era album has probably taken more flak than any of their other releases to date. I, for one, can't understand why. Maybe its simply the mentality with which I listen to Holiday's in Eden, but I can't anything offensively wrong with this thoughtfull collection of good pop tunes. Granted, it lacks the resonance of some their other work (Misplaced Childhood, and Brave, for instance), but it in turn sheds much of psuedo-progressive pretense of many of the same albums, making for a lighter, frothier, yet no less enjoyable Marillion experience."
2,The pains of replacing Fish with Steve Hogarth,"Marillion albums are fun to listen to. They're alternately moving and rocking. That said, Holidays is probably the least consistantly satisfying of their records. A bit poppy for Marillion, my guess is that the group and Steve Hogarth were feeling each other out. Thankfully, the process went extremely well and we ended up with several stellar albums since Holidays."
4,good AOR,"This is not classic Marillion-if you are looking for another Misplaced Chldhood then don't be fooled. However, with HIE the band changed direction successfully, and scored a very good FM rock album Close my eyes is a classic 80's AOR track, and The Party is a very intense, cinematic song depicting the strong emotions everyone feels at their first real party in high school.... Great stuff. Recommended."
5,Top 10 products you can't live without,"This is a great product and is hands down the best little label printer for the price. Since purchasing I have labeled every file in my home office, wires on my home theater, and reorganized my garage. The next project is going to be labeling all those little reminders and quirks on my boat. These labels hold up great in all weather conditions. With 2 free tapes included with this model, you basically are receiving a free machine at this price."
4,Uneven sounding CD . What was used for the source tapes ?,5 stars for putting this out2 stars for uneven sound qualitySome songs sound very good. Project 3 stereo and all.Some sound like an MP3. Different sources? Damaged masters?Some use noise reduction (computer based)to a fault.The hiss sounds better than the noise reduction.The act of calibrating an analog studio tape reproducer is becoming a lost art.The original vinyl sounds BETTER. This is a sorry statement.Project 3 supposedly cut their master acetates from the first generation tapes.I can't explain why this CD sounds the way it does.I'd have to talk to the remastering engineer.Mike Brydalski Buffalo New YorkRemember Lana Clarkson; she cant defend herself
2,Nope,There's a very good reason that The Free Design never hit the big time. They sound just like every other hippy harmony band from the mid and late 60's......but without the song writing chops of their more successful colleagues.
5,Great upgrade from the standard steel burner.,"Just bought a home and to my surprise, the backyard came equipped with a built-in Charmglow grill. Started right up but was cooking my food unevenly. After inspecting the burner, it appears it had rusted, cracked and the gas was not flowing properly. Figured this thing was ancient and wouldn't be able to find a replacement but amazingly there are several sites that sell replacement parts for these types of grills. I took my measurements off the existing burner and simply searched for the same size burner. I decided on the cast iron burner because a saw how worn and damaged the burner can become with time and heavy use.This new burner fit right in and now I'm a happy camper!"
2,"Should be renamed ""two-day cooler""","I purchased this cooler to augment my already well used Igloo five-day cooler (which I love.) We took them both camping and I was shocked to find that I had to keep restocking this cooler with ice every two days. The lid is designed to be pushed down, but has no tight lid-locking mechanism like the Igloo does, so I'm guessing that's the major difference. Although we took great pains to make sure that we tapped the lid down all the way around everytime we removed something from the cooler, it just did not work as advertised. I am very disappointed in this product. If it weren't for the fact that I would have to pay back the ""prime"" shipping if I returned it to Amazon, along with the return shipping and restocking fees, I would send it back immediately. I did email Coleman about this product, but have yet to receive any reply from them. My advice? Buy the Igloo and save money in the long run."
3,coleman 100 qt extreme cooler,"Very well constructed. I expect, and know I will receive great service from this product; especially when we camp in the heat."
1,Disappointing,"I checked this book out of the library based on the promise of the first sentence, in a Chapter entitled ""The Virgin"": ""It is one of the wonders of the twenty-first century that a beautiful, brilliant and broad-shouldered man could reach almost forty without someone, somewhere convincing him it was time to drop his guard -- or his underpants."" Shades of Jane Austen, I thought, could be amusing. Unfortunately, not very amusing after all. The narrator cutely names all her lovers, The Virgin, The Schoolmaster, The Lawyer, The Lover, The Lord, The Billionaire, The Actor... and recounts in excruciating detail her pathetic encounters. Seems to be a thinly-fictionalized memoir, and really, who cares? The only ones who were any good were quickly dropped, and she unaccountably and boringly chases after the cads. Waste of time, and waste of a good premise."
1,What were the publishers thinking?,"In assessing this book as chick-lit? It's really a very well defined genre right now, and just because the protagonist sleeps with ten men, doesn't make it chick-lit. The novel is dark and dreary (really); the main protagonist comes across not as courageous but as immesurably whiny.I'm surprised at the reviews and reviewers also, one of whom dubbed this a true successor to Bridget Jones--there is no way Gray can measure up to Fielding's witty style.The book has very few redeeming features. The writing is leaden, weighs you down (where was her editor?) and add to that the darkness of the book, it's suffocating.There's a blurb at the back from some Suzanne Finnamore who felt ""inadequate as a writer more than once"" upon reading this book. Well. All I can say is if THIS book makes you feel inadequate, perhaps you shouldn't quit your day job."
5,'98's Most Overlooked Masterpiece,"Hailing from Cannes with a Best Screenplay Award, this film packs a triple dose of excellence in storytelling, emotion, and performance. Certain moments are explicit, but interesting and necessary nonetheless. Often, such examples contribute to Hal Hartley's more self-conscious stylizations with dialog and camera. Produced for around $1mil, writer-director H.H.'s budgetary restrictions have bred fantastic alternatives to technological chicanery and lavish production overkill. His economy is powerful. Very, having much in common with Danny Boyle's use of Victorian stage tricks in lieu of visual effects in TRAINSPOTTING. HENRY FOOL'S subject matter and narrative pacing are quite different from TRAINSPOTTING, but the film's common success is the postmodern mythification of current day losers. Both serve societal underlings-- in class and lifestyle-- with masterful literary treatment on the screen. Quite possibly, the very best film of the year."
3,"Some good one-liners, but very difficult to watch","The schizy vacant-stare demeanor of most of the cast was very distracting. The Angus James guy was the only character in the whole movie who had any real animation. I assume this slack-jawed society that Simon was in was an affectation that Hartley was developing, so he could bring in Henry Fool with his cartoon-quickness as a way of portraying the serpent coming in to tempt people - Henry Fool brings some life into these zombies.But then when Angus James showed up, he was so authentically human, as opposed to the cardboard cut-outs everyone one was, that it got confusing, because it didn't move the story along, it just distracted me from the story-line and made me aware of the logistics of the screen play - always a sign of a bad movie to me.The ending brought in some interesting plot twists, but felt phoney and too much like deus ex machina."
3,OFF THE BEATEN PATH,"Hal Hartley is a talented and unconventional director... and one whom most Americans have never heard of. Henry Fool is one of Hartley's quirky pictures with an astoundingly strange range of characters. Unfortunately the film's storytelling drags its feet a little bit to the detrimental of the overall quality and watchability of the picture. There are sufficient twists and turns in this film and in the lives of its characters, particularly the title character and Simon, to make it worthwhile and interesting. This is, however, not Hartley's best. Parker Posey is her usual, satisfying self as Simon's sister. The cast is comprised of relative nobodies (people we have seen perhaps but cannot remember their names) and this serves the film well. You don't go into it with any expectations and leave surprised because of some of the hideous and sometimes outrageous and grotesque occurrences. You will just have to see it to believe it. This is a thoroughly quirky and surprising film."
3,"Good, but not great.","The story was good. The actors were funny. And the direction and style were creative. Unfortunately, I found that it lasted too long for my taste. It's a strange and vibrant tragi-comedy in classic Hal Hartley style, with a little more raunchiness to it. Thomas Jay Ryan is friggin' hilarious as the title character, Henry Fool. The guy who plays Simon is also funny, but he doesn't leave the same kind of lasting characater impression that Ryan did. I can't exactly recomend it, because it will undoubtably not be for ever taste. In fact, many will probably hate it very much. Others will love it very much. And still, some like me may simply like it. Either way, proceed with caution."
2,Couldn't get through it,"To be fair, I may give this another shot. But, for now, I had to hit eject after about 30 minutes. Wasn't happening for me. Neither funny, nor interesting. The main character, Simon, a sad-sack mechanic who is a fledgling writer, wears the same blank expression in every scene, so I never became interested. His mentor, Henry Fool, is nearly as expressionless. Maybe this goes somewhere eventually. But I shouldn't have to endure so much to find out. Neither should you."
2,I tried,"As a big Hartley fan, I tried hard to like this, but after about an hour, I just couldn't continue. Unlike some of his other films, which are slightly excruciating in their pace but won't let you turn away, at some point, I just stopped caring about this one, and decided to give it fast forward help. There were no great insights though, or descriptive genius. It was just too long, and not as creative."
5,Pop culture politics & classical aesthetics perfectly merged,"People, please. The syndicated reviewer-columnists, with their typically reactionary sensibilities, have found this film to be ""off tempo"" and ""uneven,"" as if the final cut of every film should contain the same polite fluidity of a ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (which, by the way, is a near perfect film). However, the rambunctious turns and reversals that define the raw drive of ""Henry Fool"" are all its own and deserving of the canonical ambition it has to rattle all complacent and homely tastes American entertainment is apt to adopt. Watch it and decide for yourself if heart-felt cinemtaic poetry is tolerable to what you take for weekend ""eye candy."" This just might be the best ""little"" film of the nineties. For myself, I could neither see or think about it enough."
1,"""Henry Fool"" was so bad, I had to stop the VCR.","I found Thomas Jay Ryan's performance, as Henry Fool, dull, overacted, and pretentious. Urbaniak was somewhat better. Parker Posey as the promiscuous sister, was one dimensional at best. The storyline was good, but the actors just didn't make the cut."
1,One Line Review,"I know people think that Hal Hartley craps gold, but after 2 and half hours of boring, I'd have to disagree."
1,One more further step in the decline of a great film-maker.,"""Henry Fool"" is, judged by the inevitable standard set by Hartley's impeccable first four films (""The Unbelievable Truth"", ""Trust"", ""Surviving Desire"", and ""Simple Men""), an ineffable abomination. For those of us genuinely exalted by his work prior to ""Amateur,"" Hartley's once uniquely promising creative trajectory seems to have dipped headlong into a sort of decadence."
3,It's difficult to tell....,It's difficult to tell if Henry Fool is a really bad good film or a really good bad film. It was quite long yet morbidly fascinating.
5,From another viewpoint...,"I don't think I can be very objective about Big Bill Broonzy.Broonzy had a long career spanning the early days of the onset of blues, ragtime blues and hokum to the late 50s when he performed ""Black, Brown and White,"" an anthem about the persistent mistreatment of African Americans. Big Bill managed to do it all (and did it with grace): Delta, Piedmont, popular tunes, protest and gospel. And he created a unique and distinctive guitar style that has echoes in modern music (see Clapton's ""Unplugged"" CD).The other reviews may provide more specifics (and more criticism). I am just trying to add back a little emotion - gratitude, and awe at the talent of this fine musician.I recommend this box set for the fan who truly loves and appreciates this man's art. And I envy you your discovery of this giant of American music.Idaho John"
2,Don't bother,"This book is for all intents and purposes a recording primer. I could see it possibly being useful to someone who has absolutely zero recording experience, but that's about it. Since there's a ton of basic recording articles already available out there on the web, this book's recording-related contents can be had for free by doing some surfing or by hanging out at the Home_Recording Yahoo group for a couple of days.As far as its coverage of the BR1180 goes, if you've already attempted to record one or two songs on the unit and have read the manual through once or twice - and that's how I recommend you approach learning this unit - you've already learned more than this book will ever teach you. The author ducks the difficult topics - at one point saying something like, ""Don't try to bounce, it's too complicated""!!! Again, you're time would be better spent hanging out at the BR1180 Yahoo group."
4,The diversity is key...,"The strength of this album is its diversity. From rock to folk, and from r&b to electronica, this album has it all. The most important aspect of Shekinah is that it shows the power and assertivness of female singers, songwriters, and musicians that can't be ignored. Pick it up, you'll be glad you did."
5,Eclectic - College and commercial at it's best,"A little bit of everything (except jazz) I particularly like Martyr and Bus to You. If this is any indication, things are looking up for women's music."
5,The Best book of natural photography,"The author use simple words to illustrate how to take good pictures, how to see the scene, and some tips of how to improve the image with computer help. Certainly a book MUST have if use like landscape or natural photo, or if you like to take picture. If you don't like to take photo, the picture inside the book is so beautiful that you will enjoy much by only seeing them."
4,Beautiful Dinnerware,"I purchased this set a year ago and have been happy with the quality as well as unique beauty. The only things I thought I would like but sometimes don't is the bowl shape. It's narrow and tall so it's not the best thing to eat some items from (i.e. salad, cereal). We previously had the shallow, long type (with the big lip) that were great for eating stews or casseroles and these really aren't. I suppose we just need to get used to eating those things from plates."
4,Newly acquired,"I selected the Aspen dinnerware because it went along with my decorating theme, use it every day and get lots of compliments on it. I especially like that each piece is a little different but carries the leaf pattern throughout."
4,Not What You Expect,"This is not what you would expect , but it isnt all horrible. Many people rate this album becuase they go out and buy this becuase they want to hear Iron Maiden songs , but this is a solo release. It is more Classic Rock based , and a solid album to boot."
1,I couldn't even sell it on ebay!,"I couldn't even sell it on ebay for a buck! That's no joke! I finally ended up giving it to my sister, and she doesen't even like it, she just wants it because it's the guy who used to sing for Iron Maiden! So now it's just gonna sit in her CD shelf and collect dust, what a waste of my money!"
1,PU!,I'm with the other guys on the review that this one is not good at all! It's just not good rock and roll.
4,Its great!,"I think the album is great, with its good moods. And there are many tracks that will stay in your mind, like ""Take These Chains From Me"". Dianno is on the mood.I wrote this review to correct the one, that says it sucks. I thought that people, who dont own it should give it a try."
3,Nice and heavy but lots of fuzz,"This is a nice blanket for Savasana and using under hips while sitting, but it sheds a lot of fuzz. When folding it a lot of purple bits fly around. This may get better with repeated washing. The color is good, more purple than it looks in the picture."
5,Simple,"I am a yoga therapist (one-on-one dialogue while assisting with postures). These blankets are the only props that I really need. I like to keep things simple, don't see the need for expensive bolsters. These blankets are soft yet provide good support.:)"
4,Nice and supportive,"I really like this blanket because it is nice and supportive when folded and makes and excellent prop. I haven't had much of a problem with fluff pieces flying around when I open and close it, but this may because I mainly use it in folded and rolled positions as a prop rather than as an actual blanket. The color is much more purple than it appears in the picture."
5,Lynch chose to have no chapter stops...,"This is a beautiful, moving, and masterful movie. One of the most touching stories ever put onto film and a must own for fans of David Lynch or great cinema. It is unfortunate that there are no chapter stops on the DVD, but that was Lynch's choice. As the director of the movie, I suppose that he has that right, but it is a shame. Other reviewers ask you to wait for a re-release. There will most likely be none, so don't let Lynch's decision dissuade you, particularly since the transfer and sound are wonderful and the few extras that are provided are equally so. An amazing story, and an amazing film. I give it the highest possible recommendation."
5,The Elephant Man,When I first saw this movie I was entranced with the touching story of John Merrill; I had to hve it in my video library.
5,Almsot Too Heart-Wrenching To Watch,"Man, this is a powerful movie. We are all moved different degrees by different things, but to witness sincerely nice people being treated cruelly always bothers me big- time....so this film is tough to watch in spots. Some scenes are just painful and depressing to view.Whatever your sensitivity, the movie is very involving and hauntingly shown with eerie black-and-white photography. Eerie, and downright beautiful camera-work in here, so kudos to cinematographer Freddie Francis, one of the best in the business.A young Anthony Hopkins is very likable and John Hurt is, well, someone you won't soon forget as John Merrick, ""The Elephant Man.""This is an uplifting movie at times, too, not just a tear-jerker or horrific in showing man's cruelty to man. Be prepared for an emotional experience and an amazing story."
5,A Personal Favorite,"A touching movie about the horribly disfigured John Merrick. Hurt and Hopkins performances are very strong and the story is written and filmed very well. This is director David Lynch's most accessible film but that certainly does not weaken it in any respect. A movie of true heart and a celebration of being human, with all it's flaws and imperfections intact."
5,If you don't like classics...you'll love this one!,"Amazing film! I have always had a hard time watching classics and actually liking them mostly because they're way before my time and I don't think I can appreciate them for what they really are. However,The Elephant Man was a slap in the face of pure greatness courtesy of David Lynch.A mezmorizing film that everyone should see in their lifetime."
1,Buy it used!!,"I love this movie. I've been anxiously waiting for it to be released on DVD, and when it finally arrived, I was very disappointed!This is a Paramount release. Paramount is notorious for releasing movies at premium prices with very little extras. This release was no exception.Oh, there was the usual trailer, and a couple of other extras. But, there was no booklet. The booklets usually contain the chapter listings, correct? Well, guess what, THERE ARE NO CHAPTERS TO SELECT!! This DVD plays straight, without scene access like a video cassette!!If you are a fan of the movie, like I am, don't be suckered into buying this version. Buy it used.As for Paramount, you've conned me for the last time. This is my last Paramount DVD purchase."
3,Bought this for doing a report,I would prob not recommend to watch this movie if your looking for something intresting I bought it so I can write a report rather than reading the whole book.
2,Messed up disc.,"I had just opened the shrink wrap and popped it straight into my DVD player and it skipped at a few crucial scenes. It really bugged me because it happened when we first were introduced to John, the elephant man, and right before he passed away. I'm about to send an email to the seller and complain because I don't think that it's right that I was sold a damaged product.Movie is phenomenal though. David Lynch is a beast behind the camera."
5,excellent movie,"This was such a moving movie, showing how we assume because someone looks different that they are not intelligent or have feelings. My daughter started crying at the ending because she felt so bad for the elephant man."
3,ok,"came in a great period of time.dvd cover was scratched and the dvd had a few too..don't know how it works yet, it's a christmas present."
5,Outstanding!,"The Elephant Man is the finest film I've seen. This true story has veryemotional performances by an excellent cast, especially John Hurt in thetitle role. This is a great atmospheric film superbly filmed in blackand white. It is masterfully directed by David Lynch. It also has abeautiful and mesmerizing musical score. An unforgettable film!I also recommend buying the movie soundtrack, which is available on CD."
3,Too melodramatic and predictable,"A man and the lifetime conflict of his existence and the self acception... Despite the fact it was based on a true story, something in this film recalls me the classic French novel ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". Very well filmed, but the plot takes an overemotional approach."
1,Not true,"This movie was well done, no doubt. But it's not true. Based on Joseph Merrick's own autobiography, he chose to enter the world of fairs and shows to earn his own keep so that he wouldn't have to return home to his step mother, who was abusively mean to him. He was very close to his real mother, though. He was not able to hold obtain a job because of his appearance, and people thought he was stupid because of the way he looked. But when he joined the shows, he said that he as comfortable there as he was uncomfortable before. (His words, not mine.) I wish they had followed the true story better, and at the very least used his real name instead of calling him John."
5,Very sad and moving story,This is a wonderful tribute to a man who recieved no love or understanding in life. And so in death we honor his memory. He was not retarded and had no metal defects of any kind. How can one possible imagine being born with a terrible birth defect then let alone today? Ask yourself how would you treat a person like this is you saw them on the street? Would you snicker or scream and run away? Or would you become their friend? This is a great movie and one of my very favorites! I still cannot see this movie and not cry because of the way this wonderful man was treated by a socitey that did not understand him and who did not dare to try. Watch it you'll love it!!!
2,"Too cheap, tiny, catch broke the first time I put it on,",This bracelet is thin and small and cheap. The catch broke the first time I put it on. The people were nice but the second bracelet I ordered to replace it came with a broken clasp! And then I measured it and it was 9 INCHES long!!!! It was advertised as 7 1/2 inches!!! Not a quality company!
3,"Good techinque, but, who cares ?","Nelson Freire has a great technique, and, sometimes, when he uses it together with his good taste we find good recordings... But, this CD is not good. His ""tempo"" is out of question. Why to play it so fast ?If you want to find out some good recordings of Freire, try to buy the 2 CDs from ""the greatest pianists of the Century"".Regardings,Roberto"
5,"Worth the purchase for ""Confessional"" alone","You cannot listen to Hatzis' ""Confessional"" without getting goosebumps. Rolston is at the top of her game on this one."
1,very boring and lifeless,"ok, i get it is a sim game and all. but its boring as hell. you go around loop after loop after loop. the music, and narrative (or lack of), and the grafix, everything is gloomy and boring. i don't know, i love forza and GT5. something make them fun and you keep going at it. this one is just a grind. plain boring.and yes, cpu does cheat as the previous 1 star rating pointed out."
4,LOVED IT!,"This is a really good movie. John Ritter is charming, Anne Archer is sexy and the story is really heartwarming. I don't know how this movie did in theatres, but it deserves to be discovered all over again. I see it as an oft-overlooked film with a big heart. Too bad the DVD has no extras other than the trailer. You can't help but root for John Ritter's character and the ending is a good one. See it!!!"
5,My Favorite John Ritter movie.,"The last time I saw this movie,It was on TBS in the summer of 198?. I can't wait to get this! I hope 8 Simple Rules Season 1 is on DVD pretty soon.I want Joan of Arcadia Season 1,with that gorgeous Jason Ritter,What a Hunk! drool! John looked pretty good looking in his Captain Avenger costume. Marty Fields:Did you put this on seperate checks like I asked you to. Waiter:No,I put them on Rye. Marty:a Smuck and Smart A** I'm surrounded.Steve:Yes,This is Robert Redford,I'm seeking New Resontation? [sp] Sorry you were out."
4,Formula but inventive concept.,"Do you really think the guy won't get the girl in the end? If you don't, you haven't seen too many main stream movies. John Ritter has always been likeable. This film was made during ""Three's Company"", and just like his Jack Tripper, his character is capable of being corruptable but finds its way back to morality. Rightfully, this film did not win any oscars but humbly tried to entertain. What can I say, a good rent, enjoyable to own and if it is any indication of its cuteness, Kinsley liked it."
5,Hero At Large,This is one of the classic movies of all time. A very simple story but fun to watch and makes you feel good after you see it. It didnt get much of a look before John Ritter's death but definitely worth a look now.
4,worth buying,"excellent record. Freeman plays not as a star but as part of a group effort. Wallace Roney plays a few good solos. Most insteresting is the fact that Freeman plays tenor, bass clarinette and flute in an equally interesting manner. This record is also the occasion to hear Jack De Johnette playing the piano AND the drums."
2,Listing Error,"The listing say's it's a 6-pack, but it's not. It's actually only one bulb. The bulb is great, the listing is misleading so beware."
4,"Simple and basic, but provides the outline you need.","It provides the guidance and logic of the letter, allowing you to do the tailoring. Use the book's contents to identify the letter. For each letter you will get a bulleted list of what should be covered in the letter as well as a complete sample letter. The book is in a neat, clean simple format, making it very easy to use and read. All of the letters contained in this book are available on computer disk -- however this is a separate purchase."
1,Sound Quality is awful,"Mayall...live.... sounds like a cant miss for a blues fan. MISS THIS ONE. The sound quality is horrible. I cant believe someone would actually put out a CD that sounds this bad. While the playing is fantastic, its terribly hard to enjoy. Only for the sincerest of fans. And even then it will frustrate you as it did me. Buyer beware!!"
4,Reluctant Reader Grabber,"This book is just right for that preteen who is losing interest in reading. The content is exciting (dancing & kissing), the print is easy to read and it is funny. The cover makes it clear that it is a girl book, but the girl is a strong, likeable character."
3,Nitin Sawhney is not so perfect after all,"If you have ever listened to his first album, the MASTERPIECE 'introducing...' (Which I count as one of the best albums ever made, serious!) this album sounds like Nitin smelled money and went on the wrong commercial road of creating weak and boring r 'n b songs that the mainstream audience likes so much. Ok, if you ditch mellow r 'n b, you'll like this album too. 'Introducing...' sounds truly more honest, more deep, and way more Indian-underground, while half of the songs on 'Beyond Skin' are more aimed on Witney Houston fans than on Asian Underground-lovers. If you don't know Nitin yet, ditch this album and go for 'Introducing... Nitin Sawney' which I consider to be one of the best asian underground albums ever. But be aware, you will be greatly dissapointed if you have his first album and expect the same high quality on this second..."
5,Now this is innovative fusion music,"I have heard Nittin prior work, but nothing prepared me for this. Don't be fooled by the RnB Exterior this album is much more. A pioneer in Asian Underground Scene makes his distinguish mark with this CD. All of the songs are really good(letting go). But then we have the songs like Nadia, An anthem without a nation, Homelands, serpents and nostalgia. These are genious tracks wich are both innovative and facinating. You have never heard anything like this. This is Fusion music at its best. Be prepared to be blown away.with this mix of sweet and sour music"
5,Simply... wonderful,"This is pure beauty on a disk. Slick but real, filled with powerful imagery and beautifu lvibes, this one didn't leave my CD player for months. In the trip-hop vain but with plenty of india-real-world thrown in. You don't want this disk. You need it."
2,Not what you might expect,"From the hype on the CD cover and Sawhney's participation in the Star Rise comp, I expected a high quality Asian Underground east-west hybrid a la Talvin Singh and Joi. There are a few good cuts here, but the preponderance of the album is American-style commercial adult contemporary, with very typical R&B flavored female vocals. The emphasis here seems to be on the production and packaging. I really got burned, having paid the import price for this. Pass."
4,Perfect for pretending,"Another gift for the granddaughter's kitchen & playhouse. She enjoys playing pretend and this is perfect for her. She loves being able to ""prepare & feed"" her babies."
5,Excellent quality of child's pretend food.,Our grandaughter hasn't stopped making us breakfast yet!!! We all love this set. Very well made and very real looking.
1,Do not purchase,I expected more food pieces. I was not aware that each strawberry was considered 1 of 16 pieces and butter was counted as an individual piece. Not worth the money
4,"Where's ""Friday""?","I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with this CD, mainly because one of his best song's (Friday) isn't on here. But other than that disappointment, this is a pretty good CD. I especially like Bow Down. But enough of my talking, Ice Cube's Greatest Hits is good. What really ...is that most stores are all sold out of the first Friday soundtrack, and I was hoping that one song was on here."
3,good but not great,"A lot of the great. Ice cube songs are missing. Would have been better if some of his first album stuff was on it,"
4,Good Album,"Ya, it didn't have all his greatest hits, but what artist puts all his greatest hits on one album. He did what he wanted to do. He put out an album and made his money. Think about it. You are a big time artist like Ice Cube and you have 25 big singles in your career. If you release an album with all of them, then nobody will ever buy any of your records again. So by putting out an album with 20 good tracks and some of them being his biggest hits, you get a taste of everything in his career, not just what made it on MTV. So I give this album a THUMBS UP."
4,"Actually, this should get 4and a half stars","Close,but no blunt cigar. Where's Wicked, Who's the Mack,Ghetto Bird and Friday? The two new songs don't deserve to be on this album, and neither do the N.W.a songs. But on a good note, there is a lot of great cube, so get the album."
4,alright,"I love Cube but prefer the whole cd's one by one cause Ice Cube was deep besides all the gangsta image he portrayed, funny he would end up working with the Neptunes.But if you feel this then i would get it."
4,This Cd makes today a good day,"This cd is great. Although I'm not really a fan of the old school Ice cube I still love every minute of the CD.best song - ""Check Your Self(Remix)"" I love das efx!This is the best ice cube CD in years a must buy,"
2,So sad !!!,"It's so sad that Ice Cube got worst & worst with time ! I'm a fan of the real Ice Cube. The one that didn't NEED to act tough to regain the respect he lost from his popularity. Now Cube is just trying to be meaner than the other rappers to show that he's one of the initiator of this gangster hip hop craze ! Unfortunatly, beside a couple of songs, everything after ""Lethal Injection"" is ... ! I'd be looking at a lot more songs from the ""Death Certificate"" album, ... where's Horny Lil'Devil ! ...Giving up the nappy dug out !! What about Ghetto Bird ?!? All in all, I think it's ... !! I just had to look at what was his ""Greatest Hits"" album like ...by curiosity. But quite frankly, I knew it was going to be ugly. ..."
3,Okay cd.,This Cd is not the greatest. It's still pretty good though. This would be a nice way too get a taste of ice cube. It is a mixture of his old and new stuff. My favorite songs are Hello and Once Upon a Time in the Projects. Enjoy.
2,Give Me A Break! (my name is O.I.),"This greatest hits album is a busting joke. They are missing so many hits from Ice Cube. They are Missing: It's A Man's World, Dead Homiez, Colorblind, No Vaseline, Wicked, How To Survive In South Central, Trespass, Really Doe, Natural Born Killaz, Ghetto Bird, LAst Wordz with 2pac, Westside Slaughterhouse,Higher, Friday, Greed, Chin Check, and Gurillas In Tha Mist. They are missing so many. Why are they acting so dumb? This should have been a 2 disc compilation, because all of the tracks that are missing equals another disc. Featuring...Ice Cube was better than this. Very disspointing."
4,I Give This 4.5 Stars,"With mostly very good tracks on this collection of Ice Cube's greatest hits, I like to listen to it a lot. This contains songs from a while back, and also has more modern songs. Some the songs are made for the clubs, but some of 'em are just nice to listen to at home. My fav songs are 'Hello' feat. Dr. Dre and Mc Ren, 'You Can Do It' feat. Mack 10 and Ms. Toi, 'Check Yo Self (Remix)' feat. Das Efx, 'Once Upon A Time In The Projects', 'It Was A Good Day', 'We Be Clubbin', 'Bow Down' feat. Mack 10 and WC (This is actually one of their group songs on a CD of theirs), and 'In The Late Night Hour' feat. Pusha T (This song is very new school, so for fans solely of old school Ice Cube tracks, this probably won't be one of your favs.) I really like most of the tracks, and I'm going to listen to it more. Bottom Line: It's definitely worth the money even if I wouldn't rate it 5 stars."
4,MAYBE THE BEST RAPPER OUT TODAY.,"Let me start off by saying that I think that 99 percent of hip hop today is pure and utter crap.However,there is that 1 percent of truly talented and good rappers out today.Im more into old school rap and he is probably the best ever.His beats and rhymes are very original unlike many rappers today.He also sings about many things in life unlike just rapping about bling bling and cars.This compilation is a good compilation with many of his classic hits.Its not a perfect compilation because its missing one or two songs,but its worth getting if you dont own all his albums.Thats it for now."
4,Cube's Greatest Hits?,"Ice Cube's records have gotten worse with each release. His first two solo albums are classic. After that, he seems to be treading water.His last several albums haven't been that good, but do include a couple of great tracks on each. This cd includes his classics, but manages to miss a few. Where is Ghetto Bird, Wicked, Dead Homiez, & Who's The Mack?? I know you can only fit so much music on a cd, but how do you overlook those songs? I bet he's planning on releasing Ice Cube's Greatest Hits Vol.2 for more money!! Docked a star for some omissions."
4,Cool Cube,"Ice Cube's Greatest Hits is solid, tho not great. He's not as catchy by himself as NWA was as a crew. Nevertheless, this is good rap, telling stories from the urban streets. Also, unlike NWA, there's not teh element of glamorizing gangsta stuff. Ice Cube just tells it like it is, with gritty realism, including acknowledging that the stuff is bad. Here are some notable raps on this disc:Check Yoself - includes a cool line from the Grandmaster Flash tune ""It's like a jungle sometimes it makes we wonder how I keep from goin' under.""Once Upon a Time in the Projects - descriptive, kinda humoress story about getting caught up in a bust when he visits his girlfriend in the projectsIt Was a Good DAy - raps about how it was a good day, just cuz none of the usual bad stuff happens.My Summer VacationBop Gun - really energetic and bouncyWhat Can I Do"
1,Just Plain Lousy,"Outside of Peter Holsapple's cool turn of psychedelia on ""You Just May Be The One"", there is not one listenable track on this collection. Buyer Beware!!"
3,Unusual And Interesting Remakes,"Here No Evil, a predominantly New South and Roots Rock tribute to the Monkees, was released on an Atlanta, GA, label and displays a distinct regional sensibility. Contributors include former-dB Peter Holsapple (""You Just May Be the One""), Mitch Easter (a great version of ""Valleri"" on which he plays all the instruments), Bob Rupe (not too long after he had left the Silos), and what may have been the last appearance of the Chant. The Vulgar Boatmen provide a strummy rendition of ""The Kind of Girl I Could Love,"" and Magnapop turns ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"" into a crunchy rocker. Many of the artists are local and/or unknown, and the song list is unusual - no one remakes ""I'm a Believer"" or ""Words,"" for example. Here No Evil was made a couple of years before Rhino reissued all of the Monkees' original albums, which may account for something. In any case, Here No Evil is interesting for its handful of rarities. - Greg Adams, AMG"
4,"No, really, it's good!","I admit that I am not a die-hard Monkees fan. I like the Monkees, but I can't sing every song by heart. But the reviews on this one are harsh! It's a fun CD. Maybe it's better if you're not a Monkees purist. I've listened to mine for years and loved it. (Oh, but I will agree that the first song is one to skip.)"
4,The local rock group down the street is trying hard to learn this song.,"A tribute album to the Monkees? Sure, why not? They recorded a lot of good songs (and a few bad songs). The performers here mostly turn in good performances of these songs. I particularly like these versions of ""St. Matthew"", ""Valleri"", ""Let's Dance On"" and ""(Theme From) The Monkees"" (which is an instrumental). Live Bait's version of ""Randy Scouse Git"" isn't very good, but I suppose they can't all be winners. This CD should be of interest to Monkees fans."
1,i would rather hear a goat pass a kidney stone,I love the monkees and everything that they have done. This disc of covers by unknown bands is a disgrace. Their arrangements of the songs are have no sense of respect toward the Monkees. I mean I'm glad they tried to release Monkees songs but they sound horrible and would cause anyone to turn in disgust.
3,love the songs...not the presentation,"the monkees are truly my #1 favorite group. the music is diverse just as the members are. this compelation included most of my favorites, but the presentation in which i recieved it was lousey. like that one reviewer before me said, ""it's an insult."" nothing against the bands who performed here. i'm sure they're fine in their own right, but these songs could've been done with a little more love...and tallent. i'm giving it a 3 because i care about the monkees too much to give it a 1."
3,Overall a good effort,"Except for the first song, which I skip every time I pop on the CD, this is an enjoyable collection if you like the Monkees. Just as the Monkees original versions were a mixed bag, so is this CD, but overall I find it a good listen."
1,"An insult, on the most part to them.","I think this cd is very insulting to the Monkees with the possible exception of maybe 2 songs. It just sounds like a parody, not a tribute. As a fan, I do not appreciate it."
3,very low teach catholic history of Jesus,"i do not think worth paying over 10 dollars for that for sure, but also it was done pretty cheat. I like it, but i love anything about Jesus just about."
2,"good for bugs, terrible for sun shielding","if you're camping, in an area with bugs, or plan on running at dusk when bugs emerge- than this is a great product. it protects the baby from bugs flying into their face.it's easy to put on when you get the hang of it. seems durable and will last. i'd give it 4 stars if it was labeled Bug Shield, but since they are advertising it as a sun shield, i feel it is very misleading.as a sun protector, SKIP IT. i wanted it to protect from the sun's rays, but quickly learned it was pointless. since you have to retract the sunshield to get it on- the sun goes directly into your child's face. the oval is made of gray mesh and does nothing to shield the sun. only if you're facing away from the sun or out when the sun is directly overhead does it work. it will go on if you leave the sunshade down, it doesn't sit flat and there are gaps- but it can work. or assemble correctly and throw a hand towel over the top half of the oval.bug protector = good.sun shield = horrible"
4,Worth the money,"What my husband & I like about the shield;1) Great at blocking the debris & sun from hitting our son2) Strong, durable material3) Great quality, especially compared to the generic stroller coversAreas of possible improvement:1) We wish the the cover had a window (just like the stroller does) on the top to peek at your child2) For the price of the BOB strollers, they should include a cover. If there was a pocket and it could somehow be tucked awayWe love our BOB Stroller and this is just a general statement but my husband & often wonder if companies that make infant/child products have children themselves :)"
3,BobRevolution Sun Sheild,"Fits okay, but the bottom front where the elastic draw string goes around the front of the stroller comes loose too easily. Use of the shade is hampered by that loose fit, especially when baby wants to walk, or get down and the stroller motor is messing with getting the sun shade to stay in place. I probably would not buy this accessory again but will keep it and use it."
3,Not very good design,"I use this a lot on our Stroller Strides Bob. Unfortunately, the only reason I use it, is to contain toys.It doesn't block a lot of the sun's rays, which is it's intended purpose. Fortunately, I live in New England, so thats not a huge problem.It doesn't let much air in - those sunny days you need this cover for? It turns the inside of the stroller into an oven.It's not very easy to install - while you can get the cover fitted in a few seconds with practice, it's by no means a simple install.Rain - why on earth they didn't make a sun/rain cover in one, I have no clue.Price - It's a very expensive cover.But - it does block some sun, and it does keep toys contained, and it's well constructed. Despite the above, I *do* use it frequently."
1,"Blocks bugs, does not block sun","I bought this so that I could take my 7 month old for walks without having to slather her in sunscreen. The information sheet that came with the product said it only blocks ""up to 65%"" of the sun. When I used it, I found it blocked closer to 0%.I gave it one star because it is totally useless for its intended purpose.That said, it looks like it would do a good job of blocking bugs so if you are looking for a Bug Shield, this would likely work for you. If I take my daughter for walks on buggy trails, I will dig this product out of the basement. Otherwise, completely useless."
3,Strips work fine no seperate chart,these test strips work good but picture shows separate color chart but it only comes with a chart on the label of the jar. Price is about the same at the store such as wal-mart.
5,Classic,"While this particular lineup of Black Sabbath didn't last, they left behind one of the best-ever Sab albums. ""Born Again"" is definitely the heaviest of their career; the whole album is just full-on. When this came out back in 1983, everyone loved it, and it remains a powerful classic of heavy metal."
5,awseome,very hard to find but worth the search. Ian Gillians vocals are in top form for this one. Trashed and Disturbing the priest anchor an incredably strong lineup of hard rockin music
2,My least favorite Sabbath album,"As I get older I appreciate the purity of form that Black Sabbath brings to its music more and more. Obviously the albums with Ozzy are classics, but I also like the ones with Dio and Tony Martin too. On paper Born Again looks great but after repeated listenings I come away feeling like this material is mostly fourth class. Ian Gillan and Black Sabbath are just not a good match and songs like Digital Bitch should be left to laughable hair bands like Winger or Warrant. That tune is just not worthy of the Sabbath name. I know alot of fans like this album but I am one who just can't seem to find much to recommend. It doesn't help matters that the production is the weakest of any Sabbath album. Basically if you are new to the Black Sabbath catalogue I would avoid it. I keep it just to keep my collection complete."
3,A Solid Sabbath Outing,"Not a bad album, eventhough no Ozzy or Dio, Tony still proves he can write riffs for whoever sings for him."
3,Pretty average - a disappointment,"I'm a huge Sabbath fan (my favorite band ever), and also a huge Deep Purple fan. So naturally, I was very excited when this album first came out. I bought it on vinyl and was very disappointed. It seems that the music tracks and vocal tracks were laid down with very little collaboration. Somehow, Ozzy could make that work, but Ian fails with the vocals on this album. Also, the guitar riffs from Tony are not up to par, with the exception of ""Trashed"". There's a reason why Gillian only made one album with Sabbath before leaving - listen to the album, it's obvious."
4,THE BEST NON-OZZY ALBUM1,"Okay, all of the Dio-phyles can kill me, but for those of us who loved the power sludge Ozzy days, this album comes the closest to reliving that magic. ""Zero The Hero"" is without a doubt the best non-Ozzy Black Sabbath song, and a few others (""Born Again"", ""Disturbing The Priest"") are damn close. It's the last album that Bill, Geezer, and Tony all did together, and after this they fluxuated from totally sucking to only being okay, so it has historical significance too. It isn't their best album, or even a completely solid album, but it's good old fashion METAL, and that's something that we all need every once in a while. And if it sways you any, this was one of Kurt Cobain's favorite albums as a teenager. No joke."
2,Gillian + Sabbath = Unsuccessful Results,"What a mess ! This thing sounds like it was tossed together in a day ! Horrendous sound, dumb lyrics (example: ""The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away/We're disturbing the priest, come to our feast"" can we say Kindergarden). Gillian's voice sounds shot,Ward is just too messed up to play anymore by this point,Butler can't be heard amongst the murky production, even the glorious riffmeister Iommi god can't pull this one out of banality. Reportedly this union was put together by management and lawyers. The result is something that is hard to believe it could have been created by such legendary musicians. No small wonder this Sabb was short lived and the original vinyl was headed straight to the cutout bin."
1,The end of Black Sabbath,"This album started the decline of Black Sabbath. Ronnie James Dio started a classic, but short-lived era, for the band after Ozzy. However, the era of vocal musical chairs began with Ian Gillan and this album. Tony Iommi went nuts with some of the worst guitar playing and sound in rock history, and the production completely reeked."
2,Black Purple and Deep Sabbath,"I bought this album on cassette years ago. I have it on cd. It is okay. It has some good songs on it. The title track is my favorite. After that, Zero The Hero, Trashed and Keep It Warm (rats?).If you are new to Black Sabbath, start somewhere else.We Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll, maybe? Better yet, start with, Reunion; work your way from there!"
2,Blech!,"Maybe it is the import release I received, but the mix on this album is horrible. The bass is way too prominent and the vocals sound like they are recorded in a can somewhere far far away.The mix does seem to get better on Zero the Hero and the songs after it, but the first 1/2 of the album is a muddy mess.As for the music itself. It doesn't really sound like Sabbath. It sounds more like someone trying to sound like Sabbath. Gillan's voice just doesn't go well with the Sabbath sound. The guitar work is good, the bass and drums are somewhat pedestrian. Just missing something.If you are a Sabbath fan and need to complete your collection by purchasing this album then I suppose it is worth it. However if you are looking for a good Sabbath album look elsewhere."
2,This isn't real sabbath,There are only 2 good songs on this album. The rest of it is a bunch of anoying yelling and guitars. Why can't Tony ever give up on Black Sabbath and do something new. Without Ozzy Sabbath is a piece of crap.
5,Ian Rules!,"Ian Gillian fits Black Sabbath better than any vocalist they ever used (including Ozzy and Ronnie James). This album really rocks. If you like Sabbath or Ian's vocals, this is a ""must have""."
4,this grew on me.,"This is underrated as far as this band goes. Gillians vocals were jarring to me back in the day but later I gave this a chance and it's actually a well accomplished sabbath metal opus. Still it's a hard thing to do , follow dio! and I should have given this a better listen back then."
4,Digital snitch,"Fantastic album, one of my all time favs, the bonus disk is great, sound quality not the best, but hey, you can't win em all, overall a great addition to the collection !"
3,Sub-par packageing!!!,"Still getting to know this albumn. I love the 1st 4 albumns by Black Sabbath. Never was a big fan of Dio. I do like Ian Gillan's work with Deep Purple so I bought thisto check it out. I've only listened to it a couple times but I like it so far. I really enjoy hearing Ian's interpretation of the classic hits on the live section. What I'm disapointed in is the packageing. My other deluxe addition Sabbath CD's have a clear plastic sleeve on the outside with deluxe addition printed on it. It protects the CD case. When I saw this CD in the picture it looked like it was the same. I was surprised to find that the deluxe edition banner is simply a piece of tape that you have to cut to open the case! What a cruel trick! Oh, the CD is remastered but it still doesn't sound as clear as it should.Black Sabbath---Born Again----import."
2,Bad Mix in the 80's and still bad now,I got this album when it first came out. Played it and thought there was something wrong with my speakers. The mix was horrible couldnt hear the drums like you should have. Really ruined an album which had some great riffs and songs. Saw the offer for the digitally remastered and jumped on it. Problem is the mix is still horrible. They added some bunus items but the mix on the lives tracks is horrible too. Album needs to be remixed not remastered. Pretty dissapointing for me. Too bad cause the songs are good.
4,"Underrated, but worth a try","If you're part of the ""Ozzy is Sabbath, period"" crowd, skip this one. Ian Gillan claims to have been ""the worst vocalist Sabbath ever had"" but it is an interesting and enjoyable mix of the talents of both parties. When you really read closely, only ""Disturbing the Priest"" really seems to have the lyrics of a Sabbath song. Nonetheless, it works.... now if only the sound quality was better."
4,Not Nearly as Dreadful as the Cover Would Imply!!,"Born Again is probably the most maligned album in Sabbath's long history. This review will NOT add to that perception! We all should agree the cover of the album is monumentally bogus and is (for the most part) reviled; Krusher Joule was probably shocked as anyone that it was chosen for release. But the music is a different story; Born Again is a riff-a-rama for any fan of heavy rock. When this album was released in late '83 the face of rock was changing - Sabbath style riffs out; Def Lep-like melodies in - but Sabbath was still able to deliver the goods (sorry for the Judas Priest pun) on this record. Granted, the production at times sounds murky, but the roar of Trashed, Zero the Hero and Keep it Warm more than make up for the dodgy production. I recommend Born Again to any hard rock fan...give it a chance!"
3,Long Time Sabbath fan,"Listening to Sabbath for 26 years. This marginal album was best enjoyed live, a super concert, one of the best heavy metal shows I saw. BS has so much material, I recommend you take the group in phases and enjoy it all. Ozzy material was the early days. Dio brought a heavier, bluesy sound, Gillian a heavy version of Deep Purple. Party to all of them. Heaven and Hell tour with Dio was a great concert. I believe he did the Black and Blue tour with Blue Oyster Cult. Branch out and check out Dio's work with Rainbow and solo, also Gillian with Deep Purple, especially later on the Perfect Strangers album."
4,rock on,This Sabbath album is undoubtedly the hardest sab ever! Its comparable to driving a railroad spike in your eye-socket and voluntarily bangin your head against the coffee table until Ian's volcals sound like Shirley Temple.
4,Deep Sabbath is not as bad as you'd think,"This is my favorite non-Ozzy Sabbath CD. It is very difficult to come by but well worth the trouble of searching! Gillan is mostly out-of- control on vocals but he articulates madness at its best! Iommi comes up with some great hard-hitting riffs and Geezer turns up the bass to bolster the bottom heavy sound. Classics here are ""Zero The Hero"" ""Born Again"" and the underrated ""Hot Line."" The cover art on this album certainly didn't do anything to improve the Sabs reputation, eh?"
2,What IS that THING on the COVER??,"Rumor has it that remastering Born Again allowed the album to finally live up to its name. What I remember when I played the vinyl in 1983 was a sonic mudslide pouring out of my speakers. Beyond that, I thought the combination of Sabbath's predilection for doom and gloom and Ian Gillan's cleverly twisted musings was the ultimate odd couple. Listening to it (yes, the vinyl edition) decades later hasn't changed my opinion of the music, and I doubt even a perfect remastering job could fix the inherent flaws in this short and wisely forgotten marriage."
3,Not the best version.,If you guys want the best version of this album get the West German Vertigo non-remastered release from the 80s. It has the best sound (if you can call it that) that is available.
2,It doesn't work.,"I like nearly every Sabbath and Purple album. This is the exception. Gillan combined with Iommi is not Black Sabbath, it's not Deep Purple and it's not ""Deep Sabbath"" but something different. Maybe the problem is that the Sabbath and the Purple sound is burned into my brain and listening to the voice of Gillan and the guitar of Iommi without really ""feeling"" the sound of one of the two bands makes me sick. Maybe I would regard this album as great if I never had listened to the two bands before. But is this actually realistic for any hard rock/metal fan on this planet?"
2,"A Sabbath ""parody"" at best","This does contain a couple of good songs, but really people a 4 star average? First of all, remaster or not the production is completely TERRIBLE considering how fantastic Mob Rules sounded. Zero the Hero is about the only song I ""return"" for, it does have a nice groove, and going years without hearing this disc doesn't bother me. I return every 3 or so years hoping THIS is the year where I get a lot out of it, but sadly it isn't. My love for Tony is the only reason I persevere. The biggest thing holding this disc back is the fact that Ian simply doesn't fit. The lyrics are so blatantly written by someone who doesn't understand this sort of music and his sound just doesn't mesh with the music. Ironic to think at this very moment in 1983, RJD is conjuring up one of the greatest cd's of the era in Holy Diver, make that ANY era:)"
4,Best Sabbath,"I loved the dark feel to this cd. The guitar solos sparkle and Gillan's voice is awesome. I think it ranks amongst his best. 'Trashed' is killer, 'Disturbing the Priest' and 'Zero the Hero' are haunting. 'Digital Bitch' is a driving, cool song. The band sounds revived and fresh with Ian G singing. This CD has gotten better with age.Wont break every song down, but this is a must have. Probably one of the heaviest cds of the 80's. Overlooked in Sabbath's catalog."
4,Forgotten classic,"After Ronnie James Dio left Sabbath to pursue his solo career, Ian Gillan of Deep Purple was brought in to fill the shoes of the previous frontmen. As far as I'm concerned, this album isn't a bad effort. Trashed and Zero the Hero happen to be my favorite tracks, but there seems to be a bit too much filler for my tastes to get a five star ranking.It should also be noted that Guns N' Roses took the main riff of Zero the Hero and used it in their hit Paradise City."
5,Last Great Sabbath Until 'Reunion',"This album got a bad rap when it came out but this is pretty much the last good album by Sabbath until 'Reunion.'This album was criticized because many unfairly compared Gillan to Dio. Ian Gillan did a great job on this album and Sabbath couldn't have picked a better high profile lead singer to replace Ronnie James Dio. All of the songs on this album are really good except perhaps for the last part of the title song where Gillan's voice breaks. Otherwise, songs like 'Thrashed', 'Disturbing The Priest', 'Zero The Hero', and 'Digital B****' still rock after over 20 years.This is the last really good Sabbath album until 'Reunion' and it still rocks after all these years. Check it out!"
5,the black sabbath classic born yet again.,"in all honesty this is my all time favorite black sabbath album.i bought the lp when it was originally released in 1983.i was just getting into hard rock and heavy metal,and this was my introduction to what i consider to be sabbath's heaviest album of all time.contrary to what many critics have said,this is a album that demonstrates veteran heavy rockers at their absolute best.this deluxe edition is not much more improved in sound quality than the 1996 gimcastle remaster.i wasn't expecting there to be a noticeable difference in leaps and bounds.if anything,having the inclusion of the bonus disc 2 with unreleased studio and live tracks makes it worth purchasing.buy it from amazon for sure.i can't say enough about born again."
2,A different sound,"BORN AGAIN: Black Sabbath's second comeback album produces a newer sound that is not so easy to listen to. Gillan's vocals are embarrassingly high at times and his lyrics seem to run together with the music so that we cannot really make out what he's saying.The good things about this album is the outstanding STONEHENGE track and DISTURBING THE PRIEST. ZERO THE HERO has a dark lurking sound to it. The band sounded like they were really trying and they've managed to produce a short but solid album.Overall, you have to be in the mood for something different. This is not a dance album. I think it might be a unique experience for Sabbath fans that are not too familiar with anyone other than Ozzy. Buy it if you're curious."
3,"No difference in the ""remastering""","I have the version from Sanctuary and I can't tell the difference in the ""remastering."" I was very disappointed. After reading some of the reviews on the Deluxe Edition, I thought maybe (just maybe) people were being too critical or picky. Boy, was I wrong!I think Iommi should have waited to see if the original master tapes could be located before releasing this one again. As we all know, the mix on this was horrible even on vinyl."
4,A Great One Time Line-Up,"First, if you don't like Ian Gillan, you won't like this CD. Probably. But I like him, as while the production on this album is at the very least 'odd', I find myself playing this more than most other Sabbath CD's. 'Zero The Hero' is one of the best Sabbath riffs ever, and there is a certain 'fabulous disaster' stigma attached to this album; I know there was supposedly some turmoil within the band while recording this, and Gillan sounds half asleep on 'Born Again' at times; Still, no denying that Sabbath sound is in tact; And while this CD is considered an oddity at most to die hard fans, it just may be the last great Sabbath album. Oh, and Gillan sounds plenty demonic here at times. I knew he had it in him. I remember seeing them live on this tour, and just being blown away by his performance. Too bad he didn't get to stay a little longer...."
2,Poor Production / Weak Lyrics,"I'll never understand the cult-like following that this album has. The studio production is the worst I've ever heard of any album released by a major recording outfit. Geezer is buried in the mix. The drums sound horrible. The lyrics appear to have had almost no creative thought put into them. For the most part, the songs have a ""phoned-in"" quality to them. The only highlights that save this from a one-star rating are some of Gillian's masterful screams & a couple of decent & fluid solos from Iommi.This is for Sabbath completists only, if you ask me."
2,Digital bitches.,"This Black Sabb album is not the Black Sabb I loved. It's not the same without Ozzie! When he was kicked out of the band, Black Sabbath sucked. Get Paranoid, Master of reality, and those other albums with Ozzie in it."
1,DEAD AGAIN,"GIllan in Sabbath was a mistake since the beginning, according to Gillan's own words in his autobiographical book. He said this was to be a project with another name, not ""BLACK SABBATH"". But one cannot understand why the production is so horrible or why Iommi permited the worst Sabbath cover-art ever to be published for this album. ""TRASHED"" is the only song worthwhile here. The rest is crap, pure garbage, below - standard."
1,Ian is no Ozzy,"Ian Gillan was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had, he even said so himself. Deep Purple and Black Sabbath sound nothing alike, to think Gillan could fill the shoes' is just plain stupid."
5,Cushions heel/relieves heel pain,This product really helps relieve the pain on my heel when I walk. I recommend it.
2,The Meters' ex-guitarist turns in a sub-par performance,"Anyone who is a fan of funk music recognizes that The Meters, James Brown, Funkadelic, and Sly Stone are essential listening. The Meters' guitarist, Leo Nocentelli, was dynamite with the Meters. His riffs on ""Fire on the Bayou"", ""People Say"", and all the great late sixties funk instrumentals were innovative and inspiring. This recording includes many of those famous tunes, including the aforementioned and ""Africa"", ""Hey Pocky Way"", and ""Cissy Strut"". The Meters' drummer, the super-funky Zigaboo Modeliste, plays on this live recording as well, making it a very attractive purchase. Don't be fooled. The playing is flat, the singing is awful, and the other musicians are NOT The Meters. The other, Non-Meters tunes are pretty inconsequential. Unless you have money to burn and are REALLY curious, don't waste your time."
2,Almost really good...,"The shaker is very good about keeping your hands from feeling the temperature of the drink as well as nice styling-- that is until you wash it in the dishwasher. I should have listened to the other reviews, it does condensate inside the shaker so you can see water droplets under whatever colored material is used to make the outside of the shaker, and the stainless steal of the inside. Of course, there is no way to seperate them to clean it. If looks matter, it shows that stainless steel is probably still the way to go if you want quality."
2,It leaks!,"This shaker has what's probably the worst design flaw that a shaker could have--it leaks. The lid fits into the cup, and does not form a tight seal. The two stars it gets are purely for form, I'd give it zero stars for function."

4,"Recover - Great Demo, OK Album","This collection was recorded live to two-track in 1989. I don't think this was ever meant for public consumption, and was most likely recorded so the band's label could decide which songs GW should record properly and include on their albums. (Almost every GW album has at least one ""cover"" song.) There are at least four songs that GW recorded on later albums or B-sides -- in all cases the next version is much more polished. This is a must-have for serious GW fans, but the sound quality and overall lack of production make this an album to be avoided by the casual fan."
5,:),got this for my friends birthday and all i know is that my friend loves it alot and wish she asked me for this sooner
4,Good Indi Flick!,"Pretty good for an Indi film and a 1st time director, I liked the character that Rob Ashkenas' played very well ""D'Britt"", I also liked the way it felt like ""Miami Vice"" good tunes also..."
4,I Really Liked this book!,"I had to read this book for a core class in college and I thought that I would have hated it. Actually, I really liked it. It told of a Chinese working woman's life. It even gives the reader an insight into her lifestyle and her struggles during this tumuluous time in history. The story even touches on the japanese invasion. I didn't think this biography would be interesting but it was. I would recommended this book to anyone. It is a light read and it is very interesting."
1,No wonder my mom had a horrid experience!,"I am pregnant with my second child and doing some refreshing before the big day. So I decided to dip into the original printing of this book which I found tucked away in a box for the past 30+ years. Holy cow! I'm glad I didn't read this the first time around! It's ridiculous! ~Even if you don't feel the urge to push, don't argue ""Accept your physician's orders at the time without questioning...""~ HA! Women have been delivering babies using doctors ONLY for about the past 100 years or so and without them for thousands of years! Doctors don't always know best, my first delivery was awful because I trusted the doc more than I trusted my own body. May I suggest Ina Mays Guide to Childbirth? I also suggest a visit with a midwife before the end of your pregnancy, you may find some enlightenment."
5,It Worked for Me!,"This book gave me the tools necessary to cope with and overcome the pain of labor, and deliver naturally without any intervention of any kind. My nurses were very impressed with the way I handled labor, and wanted to read and recommend this book, as well. The book was short, sweet, and very practical. I also enjoyed the personality of the writer coming through--like your own mothering doula, at a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend this book."
2,Not what I though...,"After reading all the reviews, I might have had higher expectations for this item...Not what I thought it was...just looks a bit cheap for my taste...The only nice parts were the cheese and the basket it came in...bread was not the material I expected...Would not recommend..."
4,Sandwich Set,"The bread looks goofy, but it's still better than other breads I've seen. The white bread looks super white (bleached out), the wheat bread is a dark brown. They're also harder than I thought. I thought as sandwich bread, they'd be a little bit more flexible, not rubbery or anything, but a little something to help make the sandwiches stay put. Salami paint job is poor, just looks like someone quickly speckled paint on it."
2,didn't impress me,"i just wasnt impressed by this book...ive read lots of erotica but i didnt think the writing style was that good. it didnt keep me turned on, it didnt keep me intersented. it wove its way around and around. i didnt see a point to it, nor did i find it as deep and emotionally sastifying as some of the other stories ive read."
3,"4 stars for the storyline, 2 for the erotica","A nicely written story with a dominance/submission angle and some kink that keeps well within the boundaries of mainstream. It is typically a book written from woman to woman, so erotic emotions are much more prevalent than really graphic scenes. A good read, but an ice bucket in the other hand won't really be necessary."
3,OK - nothing special,"The book was ok. If you haven't read any erotica or haven't ""played"" on the internet, it might be interesting. But, I thought it was pretty silly. Some of the erotic scenes were good, but there was no story to the book. It was a bunch of scenes put together -- not a novel."
1,Most Underwhelming,"After reading the other reviews for this title, I really do wonder if we were reading the same book as I was highly disappointed by it. It started off well and the first scene was interesting and well written. However, the book soon became bitty and repetitive - it seemed more like a collection of short stories that had been artificially linked rather than a well planned book, with characters just disappearing from the story after initial encounters. The concept of the book was a good one. Unfortunately the realization could have been an awful lot better."
5,Best book for first time Erotica readers,"I've never read an all out erotic book before. I think that I couldn't have started with a better book. Miranda Reigns has, I think, successfully captured the sexual fears and fantasies of most women. No matter their age. I'm looking forward to her next book. Thanks Miranda for such a wonderful book."
3,Where's the atomic components?,"I know Anderson is supposed to be one of the great thinkers in thought but I take issue with his title..If you're going to name a book Atomic Components of x, then you need to offer something resembling atomic components???? For example, physics gives us atoms, quarks, leptons, etc. Chemistry the Periodic Table of Elements...Are ""memory,"" ""knowledge representation,"" ""performance,"" ""learning,"" ""the visual interface,"" or any of Anderson's other chapters really atomic components. These all seem to be large, general concepts rather than atomic, ""unsplittable"" componenentry...The book itself is worth the read for academics and the like but if you judge a book by its title, Anderson misses the mark."
5,Much better than Melissa &Doug's play food!,"We bought both sets, from Learning Resources and Melissa and Doug's play food, and Learning Resources is by far superior. They are much more ""life-like,"" there is a lot more detail, and are larger pieces. The Melissa and Doug version is much smaller, and bulky. Plus the velcro patches that are meant to connect the pieces together take away from the ""realism"" of the food. They do help to keep the pieces together when the kids make sandwiches or burgers, but the velcro is needed because the M&D; play food is so bulky.The only complaint I have about the Learning Resources play food is that the set we bought (the sandwich and burger in a blue shopping basket) is that the ""milk"" slips out of the ""glass."" We will be Super-Gluing the ""milk"" to the glass soon.Overall, very happy with the play food, and our two year old son loves making us lunch!"
4,"Lunch, anyone?",I got this basket of lunch foods to keep my son occupied in the kitchen while I fixed lunch and dinner. He has learned alot and enjoys making his own combinations. It's not his favorite toy but it does get plenty of play. I love that it's rubbery and can be rinsed off if it gets dirty. [...]
4,"Great Quality, Very Realistic","Bought this set for my two-year-old twins that received a kitchen set for Christmas. They LOVE it. They were able to identify with each item immediately. I really love that the foods are close to life-size, but a great size for little hands. A bit pricey, but good quality."
1,Confused Much?,"There isn't much for me to say about this movie. It made no sense to me. It was poorly written. Did not enjoy it at all, except to see David Anders. If you are a very, very big fan of his this might be worth the money but I suggest renting it if you can."
1,Sets false hope,"While I do think it's a good idea to have a party to kickstart the potty training process, the title alone of this book makes you believe you can potty train your child in one day. It says in the book that after a couple of days if the child is still having accidents they should be medically checked out. We did the party, which helped get things started. After 5 days our son still has a few accidents a day, which is perfectly normal-I do not think he has a medical problem, but thinks that is just a nice disclaimer for the author if the book does not work.The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Potty Training Problems (The Pocket Idiot's Guides)is much better for addressing various issues and for being realistic. This book does not address problems like what to do if your child doesn't want to go. Also, given the amount of stuff I needed to buy for the party, it was a big let down."
2,Did not work for us.,"We tried this book's techniques with our 2 year old and although we had an enjoyable day, and it was a good jump start to the process it still took about 5 months of commitment until our daughter was completely trained and independent using the toilet. Good luck! Don't expect miracles!"
1,Toilet Disappointment,I mistakingly ordered this book over Toilet Training in Less Than One Day. I quickly realized my mistake but decided to go forward and train my child with this book. This book is more gimmick than solution. Half of the book is ideas for parties and an advertisement. The information is very basic and does not set up the child to learn independence as the aforementioned book does. It has taken us 9 months to toilet train our child with this book. The family members that have been trained with the other book have been successful in one day with minimal accidents and overnight training within a few weeks. We are now implementing the ideas from the other book and are much more happy.
3,It was OK,"It was ok. I have a special needs child and wish it had more info to help. Needless to say, we're still in diapers. He now goes every morning and most nights before bed, but still wets throughout the day."
3,Not a miracle book,"This title is so misleading. Maybe some parents can potty train their child in one day, but it wasn't the case for us. I read this and did everything the book outlined and it was still a process of trial and error to find what worked for my almost 3 year old son. It is a good resource but I encourage parents not to be discouraged if her potty party doesn't work for your child. 3 weeks into the process we're having success with an extremly stubborn little boy."
2,"Ok, but not for every child","I bought this book on a whim at a bookstore when my infant was fussing in the shopping cart. I didn't read the book jacket well enough before buying it and most likely would not have purchased it had I known that the technique only involved throwing a party. Like a previous reviewer said, this method will only work if your child enjoys a party and likes to have a fuss made about them. My son isn't shy, but he gets embarrassed easily. I need to take a more mellow approach to his accomplishments or he refuses to repeat them. This book wasn't for us."
3,Too Overwhelming,"I'm a party person, and a stay at home Mom, so I have the time. But this is a bit over the top. Even the author admits, your child will not be completely trained in one day. He or she will get there, and will be able to use the potty in one day. But for me, we'll go back to planning on several days of training, and a few weeks of consistant reinforcement. There are some great tips in the book, such as the doll to use, and the stickers, treats, etc. . . But the best tip was the little side bar leading me to the Huggies Big Kids web site. There's a ton of information there. Not a bad book, just a little over optimistic if you can't stay really exited about staying in the potty all day."
2,AMAZING PROGRAM THAT WORKED FOR US!!!,"We got this book to start the potty training process. I did not like the book. It is kind of vague on what you are supposed to do and just concentrates on throwing a potty party. ThaT is great if your toddler knows about parties and you can actually have a full conversation with him but useless if you can't. It did not cover in detail what to do during the day or what to do if the child had an accident, etc. There is a MUCH better potty training in a day written in the 1970's that TOTALLY worked for us. This one was useless.0"
2,Not a great read,"I got this book thinking it would direct me to some really critical views on potty training. I was dissapointed because the author takes a 10 minute lesson and turns it into a book! I kept reading thinking maybe we would learn somethign crucial, but no, half the book is just party ideas for the potty party they say will train your child. This book is geared to 3 or 4 year olds who have great vocabularly, understanding, and will bribe. I really didn't walk away with much but a wasted evening."
2,potty book,"This book seems to target older kids, maybe 3 and up... my son just turned 2 when we finished the book and tried the potty party. I noticed alot of the advise throughout the book revolved around older kids that could understand alot more. Also, the party ""fun"", treats, etc wore off really quick with him. He got to the point where he wanted to do his own thing instead of dealing with the potty. I think it all could work well with some children, but not with mine. He was so excited at first and went potty quite a few times. Then, the next few weeks were tantrums, not wanting to sit on the potty, not caring if lollypops or chocolate were dangling right in front of him, to the point we are at now: no potty what so ever. I wish we approached it in a simple manner, but now we can't even get him to budge, even if we take a few weeks to a month break before trying again. I will say that there is a lot of great potty training advise in the book, no matter if you use that approach or not."
2,Not for me...,"I thought there would be some special secret in this book that would make my child magically potty trained. Potty parties?! Really?? That's it!?I haven't really read the whole book yet but just reading the forward and skimming through, I just don't think this idea is for me and my child."
3,Not used!,"I have no idea if this book works or not. When my mom found out I had ordered it, she had me bring my daughter to visit her, and she did it in 4 hours! The book came 2 days later, so I returned it without reading it. She was completely trained at 2 years 1 month."
5,Teri Crane is a miracle worker!,"Imagine having no clue about how to potty train a child. Now imagine having to potty train TRIPLETS! I did not know where to turn when my triplets needed to be trained and luckily I found this book. I EASILY trained each of them using the techniques in this book. They each were FULLY trained in ONE day! The book is well written and easy to follow. I have recommended it to every mom I know (especially those who have limited time due to caring for multiples ) and they have had equally great results. Whether your child is partially trained, or not trained at all THIS is the only source you need to potty train IN JUST ONE DAY!"
5,"Great Book, Great Outcome","We did our potty party last Saturday, and one week later we are on day three of ZERO accidents!! My son turns 3 tomorrow and he's the kind of kid who likes to sit and read books and do puzzles so we did not need to struggle with sitting on the potty. I have to admit there were a couple of times on party day that I had my doubts and it was not smooth sailing. But the results have been tremendous, and just as important for me, my son and I are closer than ever and have bonded over the experience. A couple of logistics notes: we used a lot of imagination and not a lot of props so don't worry if you don't think you have the time, creativity or energy (or money) to do the full blown party. M&Ms and Thomas stickers have kept us going through the week! I blogged the full experience of our day at [...] if you want to know more!"
1,Save your time and money!,"I do not recommend this book. You will notice that the majority of the positive reviews are written by parents who used the book when their kids were over three years of age! I think that the procedures followed in the book are more suitable for OLDER children which is why they are moderately successful. If you are interested in training your child before they are three I recommend you allow him/her to go diaperless. Bring attention to their elimination episodes and take them to the potty chair immedietly after a movement. Give rewards and clap and they will get it. My sister and I trained each of our kids before they were 19 months old by doing it this way. Kids that young really don't understand the ""party"" concept but they sure can understand some positive praise!"
5,Great gift idea!,This book makes an excellent gift for parents with young/potty-training aged children. We had great success with Ms. Crane's training ideas and love to share them with other parents.
3,A little over the top...,"I bought this book for my daughter thinking it was another with a similar title that I'd used to potty train her sister almost 35 years ago. Still, when it arrived, I kept it and looked through it. The approach was similar to the book I thought I was buying, but seemed more complicated and, frankly, a little over the top. (Potty parties with princess, super hero or other themes??!)I'm sure the approach works well, but in today's economy I wonder how many families could afford the cost, which if you calculate the price of the potty doll (between $45 and $65) plus the recommended videos, books, treats, party decorations, etc could easily run several hundred dollars! There were some good ideas the book,but I'm afraid this grandmother prefers the simpler, less expensive approach ofToilet Training in Less Than A Dayby Azrin and Foxx."
3,interesting reviews...,"I only gave 3 starts bcasue I have not read the entire book, but the method seems similar to ""Toilet Training in less than a day"" and this looks like an updated version. That book has rave reviews and the method worked great for us.You don't wait till your child is ""interested"" in eating peas, ""interested"" in holding your hand in the parking lot, ""Interested"" in taking a bath. It is about readiness, not interest. I think we lead the way in our children's success with potty training. We did not throw a party, but made a big deal about the new undies, dry panties, and trainign the doll.I think the key is YOU making the decision to throw the diapers away and make the decision we are doing this. This is what we do.... we pee pee in the potty. I am afraid too many of the bad reviews on here will have 4 year olds who are not potty trained becasue they as the parent did not lead their child well in this.Empower your sweet little babes! They can do this! (S0 can you!)"
1,Big promise Big disappointment,"This took a lot of planning but my son didn't read the book so he go along with it the way he was suppose to. The party idea was fun, but he was confused and frustrated and I think he felt a lot of pressure to proform a big task in such a short amount of time. The readiness methods have been around forever, probably because they are the right way to go. We're going to relax and not push the process."
3,A Book of Common Sense,Well it was ok but to me it was just common sense I mean what kid doesn't like to be rewarded I don't need to pay eleven dollars to know that
2,Over the top!,"This method is so over the top. I like the idea of a potty party but really, matching undies for the doll and your child, presents, all other children and people out of the house? It just seems over the top and unneccesary. I do like the idea of devoting one full day (or weekend) to potty training which is why I gave it 2 stars vs. 1.We did tell our daughter that she gets a potty party at Chuck E Cheese when she was potty trained and that really motivated her, she watched Potty Power DVD which she loved and we just did our own reward system (2 skittles for pee, a dum dum for poop)but this was just over the top, in my opinion."
5,Highly Recommended!,"This very extensive text on customer relationship management leaves nothing unsaid or unexplained. Authors and editors Don Peppers and Martha Rogers tackle the subject with admirable organization, clarity and depth. They define every important term and do not lose the reader in marketing jargon - a rare virtue in a book about marketing. The text, including contributions from other well-known experts in the field, propounds a well-developed theory of customer relationship management (CRM) and sets out numerous examples to illustrate, explain and clarify the theory. Useful as a handbook, textbook or reference manual, the book covers - among many other core subjects - customer identification and differentiation, customer feedback, an analysis of retailing and basic tools for CRM. We highly recommend this book to service-oriented managers and executives. To form profitable relationships with your customers, first get friendly with Peppers and Rogers."
2,There are better books out there.,"We bought this book for my 2 year old niece for Christmas. Being a new aunt and uncle we bought a couple of 'aunt' and 'uncle' themed books and I have to say there were not the hit we thought they would be. Unfortunately, this book gets hidden in the bookcase and I have yet to hear anything about it. On the other hand, we gave my niece some great touch and feel books (also from the amazon marketplace) that she absolutely adores. My suggestion, skip this one and go for something more enticing and interactive."
5,Simple yet perfect combining counting with matching shapes,My 3 yr old daughter definitely likes this. It is well made and stores well on a shelf. It would have been great to have a top lid of some kind too. I would certainly recommend it.
3,Learning,"I bought this because it was simular to one a friend has. I love it but for one thing--the container of the puzzle should always be bigger, this way when children are done or you need to quick clean up you can just throw all the pieces in its container and put lid on. Manufactures should think of these things more."
4,Another Great Work of Art,"Matt Ender is incredible with his collaboration of Celtic music. This CD is great and the vocals are superb. If you want great uplifting LIFE music, this is it!! I look forward to future works by Matt.:)"
4,A Cute Guide With Some Decent Info,I got this book given to me as a gift from of all people my mother in law. She is aware that I used to be an exotic dancer so I was confused as to what I might need this for. But it turned out to be a very nifty little guide for a not bad price. It won't turn you into a demi moore type dancer from striptease really fast but it gives you the knowledge to at least get started in giving your man (or womaan) a cute little striptease. It covers many topics as well including various music choice to what to wear right down to personal care (aka getting waxed). Give it a go it's well worth the read if your interested in stripping for your man.
1,:(,"I am new to amazon. I typed, ""stripping dvd"", into the search engine and I found, ""The Housevife's guide to: The Practical Striptease"" and I was excited to try it out. I saw a link to books and I thought that they have it in books as well, but that what I ordered would be a dvd because that is what I typed into the search engine. I was very disappointed to find my order was a book. The book itself is interesting, it's just not what I wanted."
3,A mixed bag for shorter US edition,"Parts of Human Traffic were so banal and sophomoric as to make me cringe, and parts were spot-on and hilarious. The acting was much better than in ""Groove"" (although that other dance-related film captures the excitment of the music better). A must for anyone interested in dance music, and a time-capsule of a certain slice of youth culture. The US edition seems to be 15-20 minutes shorter than the UK one, and some of the dialogue is overdubbed to replace Britishisms with Americanisms. Personally, I *hate* such tampering. I want to see the original movie. Maybe I'll have to buy a UK DVD of the film."
5,Amazing Head Trip...,"If you consider yourself hip, young, cool or a myrid dance junkie...buy this blindly. This is a beautiful story about a bunch of kids havin a blast. The extream music video like qualities of this gem come shining through via great dialougs, cool acting and stylish cinematography. The story in itself has great depth and touches on many topics like youthful zest, love, sadness, happiness and drug use. This film is,form a certain perspective, a strong retalliatory statement against the consevative middle class population of England who blindly beleive ""todays youth"" is going to hell.I am a complusive raver and i can identify closely with all the caractors in this movi. This is inventive and modern film making at its best and i highly recomend you buy this work of art. Also, if you like this, you should check out others movies like ""GO"", ""Groove"", ""Trainspotting"", ""Scratch"" et al.oh ..and while your at it..buy the soundtrack too ..you wont be dissapointed...RAVE ON!"
5,Reach for the lasers...,"Great movie.. Fabulous soundtrack.. Highly recommend the movie to everybody. SOundtrack featuring classic dance hits like ""energy 52"" and ""Come together""...Get the dvd and the soundtrack from amazon.com! real great and prompt service too.."
4,Good Flick,"I saw this film's premier at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival and enjoyed it the most out of all of the films I saw. (Boiler Room, Virgin Suicides, Love and Basketball, etc.) It's got that ""Ferris Buler narration"" where characters in the movie actually stop and talk to the viewer while the world in the background is oblivious. I enjoyed the characters and the plot thouroughly. It has just the right mix of humor and subversive behavior. A must see. To hell with what the Amazon people think."
1,Absolutely useless for most cities!,"This book is based upon the assumption that you can locate a zip code by telephone area code. This only works for small rural communities. In large cities such as Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Miami, etc. there are many telephone area codes for a single zip code. If you are looking for a zip code this book will indicate several telephone area codes for one zip code. If you are looking for a telephone area code this book will reveal several zip codes. How would you know which zip code to use if there are several zip codes for one area code? Totally bogus and useless. This book is only a half inch thick compare to other zip code books which is about four inches thick."
5,Great deal & very timely,CD arrived in GREAT condition. I've listened to it several times & enjoy it more each time I hear it.BEST of all I bought it for myself for Mother's Day & got it earlier so now I can listen to Amy & bake stuff on my big day.
3,Self indulgent family meeting,"The idea of a meeting of 'Papa"" John with Joey was a good one. The main trouble is that they don't appear to have taken a lot of trouble to test how some of the tracks would actually end up sounding. So ""When the Saints"" included for John's wife Laurene doesn't work, the version of ""My Buddy"" is an embarrassment and ""Blues for sweet Sue"" needed severe editing.On the rest of the tracks there are some moments when it all comes together. ""Bags Groove"" is good and the version of ""Tuxedo junction"" works well. They might also have done better to dispense with the services of Houston Person, whose strident Tenor playing is in direct contrast to that of Bootsie Barnes.It might also have been a good alternative to have let Melvin Sparks, playing at his mellow best here, have had more solo's.If you're looking for Joey DeFranco's best work, don't start here!"
5,Booker Just Blows Me Away!,"I am a James Booker junkie. I have not heard a bad Booker album or track for that matter. What makes this album different from others in my collection(I have 6)is that he is teamed up with a group of New Orleans all-stars and so we get to hear this very special piano player with guitar, sax, and drums playing along. How does this egomaniac piano player fit in? Seamlessly! Once again you will not believe that there is only one pair of hands on the keyboard. I defy you to listen to this album and not have your fingers and feet tapping along. I regret never having heard Booker live but thank heavens we have these lost tapes to fill in some of the holes. He played to well and died to soon. If you like New Orleans funk/blues, I think this album is a must."
1,Pointless and not worth 5 bucks,The title says it all. This article says virtually nothing about the subject. A rip off. You are better off searching on google.
4,Finally depth is added to this clan.,"This book is a cultural and historical study of one of the darkest of clans. The focus is one the culture and the mindset of the ""snakes."" This book discards the worn out stereotype of ""Servants of Set"" and gives them more depth. They are still his servants, but the are more... main stream. They still have thier dark goals, but they are protrayed with more human motivations. They are seen as religious, not mindless fanatical worshipers who cant think about anything beyond Set and snakes. Set colors everything they do, but he no longer appears to dictate everything that they do. If you read the clan novel, you will see that this clan book better describes Hesha, the previous work made it hard for me to imagine how a clan of fanatics could create such subtle schemeing sellers of secrets. This work paints a picture that makes it clear.The down side is that the list of disciplines is weak."
2,buyer beware,The dress looks totally different when you receive it. It is very cheap. In addition the dress is shipped from overseas. You might have to pay customs when you return it. I didn't like the material of the dress. It should not be listed as formal because of the fabric.
2,not the best,"this book, is an old military manual, not a very useful service manual. disappionted. Get instead, ak-47 and ak-74 kalashnikov rifles and their variations by joe poyer, it has more info."
2,Quality Issue,The information contained in this manual is good however most of the illustrations are to dark. They are also not crisp which make it difficult to make out the details. I was disappointed and unable to recommend this product.
5,Nice quality and wholesome looking.,"We really appreciate the Only Hearts dolls. They are much more wholesome looking. We really appreciate the ones that have the more feminine looking clothes on, such as this princess one. Nice quality and quick shipping."
2,Two stars for two laughs,"Bill Stott is no Gary Larsen, that's for sure. I gave two stars because I laughed twice, maybe, at his cartoons. That's twice over about sixty pages. The number of pages is uncertain because no one bothered to paginate the book, the assumption being, I guess, that a cartoon book doesn't need numbered pages. It is easy to see how readers may latch on to one or two of these cartoons as being typical of their own office environments. Then cut them out or photocopy the one or two they like, and post in the office for everyone to laugh at, for a few months. After that, it might get old. Diximus."
3,Gift for 3 year old,"Well constructed. Should last, but not very realistic looking except for the lettuce and cake."
5,My 3 year old granddaughter loves it,My 3 year old granddaughter loves it and it was well worth the money that I spent on this toy.
2,What are you people talking about???,"Man, what a bad movie. I was looking forward to this movie from all these good reviews, but I was so bored that we didnt even finish it. Did I rent the same movie as all of you? There was not a single character that I cared much about. The plot was so boring with this tunnel, or whatever, in Kazakstan...Villains with bullets in their heads (that make them smarter daily until they die) what the hell is this? Some crazed science fiction. Ok, the skiing scenes were cool, but thats all I liked. Denise Richards, although I wanted to like her, deemed to be close to impossible. Judi Dench was a bore with no good lines. The nuclear scenes were laughable and hardly interesting. Again, I wanted to like this film, but I cant. And what's with that guy with the caviar?"
3,What happened to Bond?,"I'm a long time fan of all Bond movies but had a hard time staying interested in this one. There was not enough emphasis on the villain's reasons for doing what he did. He wasn't convincing -- just a sad, sad figure. As for Elektra, there was not enough reason to dislike her, either. Brosnan's ""love"" scenes with the women had no steam whatsoever, and Denise Richards spent each of her scenes wandering around in a daze. Brosnan looked weary the whole time. Made me think he was getting tired of the part. Or maybe he just wasn't clicking with his co-stars? Hope the next one is better!"
2,Dalton should have continued with the role of 007,"Like an earlier reviewer stated, Brosnan squandered the promise he showed in Goldeneye. His subsequent movies including TWINE have been disappointing. Too little plot, too many action sequences and a rather weak performance by Brosnan have taken their toll on the series.For anyone that has seen the 1987 movie ""The fourth protocol"", you will know what Brosnan is capable of. In that movie he played a lean, mean russian agent. If only his portrayal of Bond was more like that, he would be much more convincing as 007. It was a sad day when Dalton decided not to return as Bond in Goldeneye."
2,Not Enough There,"Should have been titled: The Last Film Was Enough. Everything in this film was predictable, and worse, it was lifeless. I just didn't care whether the world was saved or not, but there were lots of explosions."
2,"The World is enough, and in this world we do not need. . .",". . . such a stupid movie. Being a big Bond fan I was hugely dissapointed by 'The World is Not Enough'. Sophie Marceau is good playing the main villian, Electra King. I gave the way the surpise she is a bad guy, oh yeah baby!"
4,Annoying 007,This DVD has an annoying white 007 that appears on-screen in the lower right corner occasionally (6 or 7 times throughout the movie) for no reason. We found that quite distracting.
2,Not A Chance!,"What a disappointment! Being a Bond fan, I expected nothing but the best. But as soon as I found out that Denise Richards was starring in the 'The World Is Not Enough' I knew I was in for trouble. I was right. Richards' performance was dreadful and she should go back to acting school. It was a mediocre plot with an even poorer script. Didn't work for me this time."
1,The worst James Bond movie to date!,"In my opinion, this movie, The World is Not Enough, was the worst movie in the super spy James Bond series. The plot was lame, with too much family related stuff, the villian, who was not very interesting, had almost no physical or verbal contact with Bond, making him boring, and Bond's new girl friend, Christmas, was way to enthusiastic about everything. If you want to see a few good James Bond movies, check out ""Goldfinger"" or ""Goldeneye""."
4,The newest Bond classic since Goldfinger,"The names Bond, James Bond.In this Pierce Brosnan gives another episode of agent 007 once again in tighter situiations topped of with more stunning girls and great gadgets.Our british agent goes to investigate the murder of an MI6 agent who had a classified report from a russian energy department.While there he demands the name of the asilant with no sucsess.Middleman banker Lachaise is threatened by Bond only to be shot by 'Cigar Girl'.Following is a intense scene over the Thames finished by a fall from the milenium dome,an escape from a helicopter with two saws below it and a nuclear bomb.Almost perfect but it lacks that little something and the plot may make you a little confused.Overall it still is a must see and worthy of being called a James Bond film."
5,"I like this one better than ""TND""","I like this one because it is more expressive than some others that i've seen. I didn't like ""TND"" and didn't know what I'd expect out of this movie. It does have good action and it does have a little sexuality and neud scenes but i don't care. It wakes me up unlike some other very ""wannabe action"" movies and my favorite was probabally ""Goldeneye"" out of all of them."
2,"Unless You're a Big bond Fan, Don 't See It","This was a ridiculous Bond film that used women as objects, he had sex with 3 boring characters during the course of this movie! The sex jokes finally have gotten tiresome. The action was good, but certainly not great, though there were a couple of very cool, ridiculous moments, for which I will give it one more star. The idea of someone getting stronger everyday, because of being shot in the head is about as stupid as any idea that I've ever heard for a villain in my life. I personally liked Tomorrow Never Dies. It had pretty good action as well, and it was funny, and had a badguy that was a lot cooler that this Renard. If the reason you like Bond is just for the sex scenes, enjoy. If you have a decent reason to want to watch a film, don't even bother."
2,A poor follow up to TND,"Brosnan has all the makings of a great Bond, in fact, his acting in this film is just fine. His problem is the script, the storyline, and the supporting cast. The stunts were great, the opening sequene was exciting, plenty of explosions, neat toys and one gorgeous car, but these elements could not save the film from it's tired and trite villain, a storyline that you could completely figure out by the end of the first twenty minutes of the film, and really, really poor Bond girls. The character of Elektra was not only predictable but boring, and Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist, one can only wonder who comes up with that sort of rubbish. The bad puns in the movie were over kill.Bond films aren't supposed to be incredibly cerebral, but this was a joke. The film floundered horribly. I considered it a total waste of two hours. With a Bond like Brosnan, Hollywood has to be able to do better than that!"
2,Could hardly wait till the end of the movie...,"Contrary to the reviewer Mr. Dave, I would place my references in reverse order (""Goldeneye"" first). All this storyline with Baku gas pipeline was ridiculous (and a Christian church in a cave! Guys, even Georgia does not live in the Middle Ages anymore), choppers with flying frame-saws and Mr. Bond who, despite all laws of physics, floats up and does not drown - it is more than I can bear. I also bet that Electra King was a better bedmate than Mr. Doctor Jones (an atomic physicist? Why not Mr. Einstain's daughter?): she at least has a sparkle of intellect in her eyes. Yes, James Bond is an immortal hero, but can't he suffer a little bit, get wounded at least? I heard Mr. Brosnan signed a contract for several more Bond episodes.At least I'll not waste my money on this rubbish anymore..."
3,Decent movie,Enjoyable JB flick is a little long and some actors are misused. Desmond Llewelyn's last movie as Q. Watch it.
3,"Good movie,","Just like all James bond films, this one doesn't disappoint. Makes for a very good story, but does not follow a continuing story line as the new Bonds do."
4,It's Bond baby!,"Over the years Bond has faced steel-toothed giants, hardy men with razor-sharp hats, and an assassin with a golden gun, but never such an original villain as Renard, the man who feels no pain! The story has some interesting twists and turns and all in all is ""rather stocked"" with danger, action, mystery and romance. Although unbelievable as a nuclear scientist, Dr. Christmas Jones makes for a very stunning Bond babe. Even though the fight between Bond and Renard is short and over in only a few moments, and the death of Renard unexpected, acting of his death was great. If you like Bond, action or a interesting story, rent The World Is Not Enough."
4,Sophie Marceau's Elektra King,""" ... Ultimately, this World is not enough despite its better intentions. --Sam Sutherland"".Pierce Brosnan plays a stronger and tougher Bond this time, the story is more complicated than in the previous episode, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", and the bad guys (don't think you know them all right away) are really bad.Praise for Sophie Marceau who plays very well Electra King - an unexpectedly complex character for a Bond movie ! Watch her in Mel Gibson's Oscar winner ""Braveheart"", next to Sean Bean in the 97 film rendition of Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina, and, with Philippe Noiret in ""Chouans !"" directed by Philippe de Broca, who, also, introduced us to Catherine Z Jones.Sophie Marceau is not just a very good looking woman, but she is also a good actress ! She is the star of this last 007 adventure."
5,Great Movie!,"This is a pretty exciting movie. I have to say Pierce Bronsan makes the best James Bond, even better than Sean Connery in older James Bond movies. Some of the top action scenes include the Boat Chase, James Bond and Electra King(a very beautiful woman) getting chased while skiing and the helicopter scene. The basic story is that James Bond is sent to protect an oil heiress, whom unknown forces are trying to kill.Bond thinks it is because they don't want competition from her Oil pipeline. However, the story takes a surprise twist that most won't see coming. For that reason I give this movie 5 stars; for this unusual twist that is not there in other Bond movies."
5,James Bond - The World Is Not Enough,007 is alive and well in this latest edition to the James Bond family... Pierce Brosnan and Sophie Marceau at their finest!
4,Best Of The Brosnans,"Although this movie is at times clichéd and, yes, Denise Richards tries but she just IS too improbable, it's pretty good. I felt more for all the characters than I did when watching Tomorrow Never Dies and Goldeneye. There were some good jokes and although this isn't one of my real favourites, it's enjoyable enough if you're a fan of the genre."
3,This film lets Brosnan's Bond down....,"As a huge Bond fan I can't understand the praise this entry received. The film was uneven. Due to fact that while the 2nd Unit was doing the action (top notch I may add) Michael Apted (hapless more like) was making a pigs-ear out directing Brosnan, Dame Judi Dench and Sophie Marceau. Please bring in the A list directors- and take your time - the last two movies were rushed out on the success of GoldenEye"
3,watch it,I recommend watching this film because the graphic is very good and it is a intersting film to watch. This will help you to solve your nighmare problems. The clothes good. the dirctor way is strange but fair.
4,James Bond -The World is Not Enough- (Seafire12),"This DVD has it all. Not only was it a great BOND movie but the DVD takes the Dolby Digital 5.1 and shows you what it is made of. You can hear the choppers in the movie fly in from behind you and pass over head. AWESOME! Brosnan is at his best he still has his wit but portrays a more down to earth and serious BOND. It has to be the best BOND movie in some years. A mixture of Romance, Action and true Espionage makes this movie work! Although Sean Connery is my favorite BOND Brosnan is a close second. I look forward to more movies done by this great actor! Buy it!"
4,Stylish And Entertaining.,"""The World Is Not Enough"" proves like ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" that the longest running series in movie history is ready for the 21st century. Maybe it's not as good as ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" but hell, ""The World Is Not Enough"" has a great blend of style, action, humor and beautiful women. It's intelligent and complex. The complexity is it's only flaw because sometimes it has to slow down when it shouldn't to explain all the detail in the intrigue. Still, it makes up for it's flaws. It's entertaining, keeps you guessing and has a lot of style in the settings, suits, gadgets, action sequences and yes, cars. It's visually rich in it's own way. The action isn't stupid and elevates the story. Maybe it's not as good as one expected, but it's still fun and interesting, very entertaining. I don't get the slack Denise Richards has been getting, I think she did a great job as did every other actor. ""The World Is Not Enough"" is original and fun, good action flick."
3,"Good, but not a classic...","Having loved all the other Bond movies, I went up to Target today to purchase this DVD. I hadn't seen The World Is Not Enough yet, but all my friends and people I talked to said it was excellent. And, like I said, since I liked all the other Bond films, I'd probably like this one. As much as I hate to say it, this film was less than average. I thought there would be many more action sequences, however there were far fewer than I had imagined there would be. Carlisle (Renard), who is hyped up to be the main villain here, does a great job in the role, HOWEVER he DEFINITELY did not come off as being very evil. He and Bond had ONE altercation which lasted MAYBE 2 minutes. They hype him up in the movie to be so impervious to pain, yet he dies quite simply. The only reason I'm giving this movie 3 stars is because of the superb acting and the good plot, other than that, it really doesn't deserve any."
3,"Good Film, but needs to stick with the formula that Ian Fleming created the character","I think that Brosnan was trying to create his own Bond Character. The film and the action was excellent. The villians I question and it brings us back to better writers and sticking with the formula. Bond is trying to be too dramatical and Brosnan is getting older and grayer and sleeping with women in their 20s. The bond girls are cool, not a big fan of Denise Richards. Action is excellent but less drama."
5,A great story and wonderful acting.,I had a thought that Bond would not let me down. A great movie. 007 is back and great.
5,An Excellent Bond Film.,"With James Bond films you know what you are going to get: Amazing chases, fights and outlandish villains. This film does not disappoint. This is action-packed and exciting. One action scene follows another with brief breaks for humor or intrigue. Bond has the best gadgets we've seen in a while.It's a good formula that it is dangerous to alter. Look at the Timoty Dalton Bond movies. Dalton made Bond a misty-eyed, sensitive and vulnerable soul. Oops! Brosnan's third shot finds him hitting his stride and finding all the right notes. Sean Connery is the ideal Bond, being the first. Here Brosnan rediscovers the toughness and ruthlessness of Connery in ""Dr. No."" He is nearly as suave as Connery and comes close to matching Connery's overwhelming confidence. Bond is a superhero. He's not mere mortal man!This is a must-have for Bond fans. Anyone who enjoys action and international intrigue will enjoy it, too. I recommend it highly."
5,Great Movie,"Bond is awesome. I saw it for the first time yesterday. I loved Bond and this is everything Bond had to offer plus a lot more. This movie has awesome special effects, better weopons, smarter enemies. I would not think twice about buying this movie. You will not be disappointed !!!"
3,Why?,"Why are there no subtitles in english, just in french or spanish? My english is very good but sometimes I may loose something, so I use the subtitles to check my understanding. All other Bond titles I have from this special series (Goldfinger, Goldeneye, Live and Let Die, Tomorrow Never Dies) have subtitles in english. Why this one doesn't? Not to mention something more serious: it seems that all deafs in America have been teached french or spanish last year. It must have cost zillions of dollars to you tax payers... The film is ""Bondonian"". That good old ""love it or hate it"" point. I love it, but his edition is not as good as others in the series. The DVD extras are shorter. Not the place to save, Warner."
2,Wow...I'm in a minority but I didn't like this film...,"I thought this film, although seeming to have all the right elements of a Bond film, just didn't have any ""spark"". Pierce Brosnen is a fantastic Bond so he isnt the problem...and even the story was Bond-esque, so that wasn't it. Adding John Cleese was a stroke of brilliance! He was the brightest spot in the film and who ever thought of casting him in this hopefully reccurring roll was absolutely right on the money! The film seemed overly long to me and there were even a few times when I was sure it was over only to (groan inwardly)find that it wasn't. I rented this at the video store and felt compelled to watch it and get my moneys worth but to tell you the truth, had it been on TV I probably would have switched to a re-run of Gilligan's Island. All the Bond film elements were presant in this film but for me this film just didn't ""click""...wait for it to come on TV."
2,The funniest part - Denise Richards trying to act,"Were it not for the inclusion of Denise Richards in this movie, I would have enjoyed it a [bit] more. One can usually forgive all the characters that are thrown in a Bond film. But I cannot stress enough the unbearable scenes in which Denise Richards opens her pie-hole; as if reading straight from the script with no feeling. She wrecked the entire film.Not one of the best Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. Especially with the goofy story line of the wacko Renard, who doesn't feel pain. And M, getting involved too closely in the operation, leading to her kidnapping."
3,"It's not bad, but not great","Ok all you Bond fans. If you sat through MAN WITH A GOLDEN GUN or MOONRAKER, then you know what a band bond movie is. 'The World is not Enough' however is by far, not a bad bond movie. Their are some really slick chase scenes, and its a fun time. Its not fantastic, but its its worth checking out!"
5,This Movie is more than enough for me!,"This movie has it good with my opinion. Arguably, this is one of, if not the best, bond film ever made. I've been a longtime Bond fan, and this movie is a fine pick-me-up after Tommorrow Never dies and that last Tim Dalton one. The things that caught my eye most were the superb opening scenes, and the non-stop action. The first chase scene is the best of any Bond film (i'm sure others will agree). I went to see it in theatre with some friends and we all loved it. Now i'm looking foreward to buying it as soon as it comes out from Amazon( May 16). So, I give this movie 4 3/4 stars. The reason being, some of the things about the film are unbelievable, such as the likelyhood of James surviving all those fights. But, that is to be expected from a good Bond Movie. So, Enjoy!"
4,Great Action!,This was a great movie for the start and middle of it but when it gets to the end it just goes on and on and on. I recommend seeing it for the action that's involved.
3,Same old bond.,"If you're the kind of person who likes intense action scenes mixed with spy gadgets and busty women then this is for you. I found it enjoyable, but it's not something I'd like to watch over and over and for this reason I'm not buying this movie."
2,"Either change, or retire Bond","After about fifty movies featuring James Bond, you would have thought that they would change the formula around at least a little. It's the same old stuff and Pierce Brosan looked as though he was just going through the motions and that only results in a dull movie. I'm not saying that he's bad in his role, in fact, he's the best Bond period! But the plot, action chase scenes, and the girls...it's getting played out. Either change the Bond formula, or end it here.And another thing, pleeeeesssee get a villian that doesn't bore me to tears! Carlyle was promising as the bad guy who could feel no pain, but nothing ""cool"" was done with him!"
2,No excitement,Probably the least exciting Bond movie ever made. Nothing happens that is worth mentioning. There's a scene with a pipe or something that is good for about 2 seconds. The rest is an unbroken succession of bore after bore after bore. How on earth the filmmakers thought that audiences would be entertained by this is a mystery to me.Robert Carlyle is so unscary he belongs in Sesame Street. Denise Richards is a nuclear scientist (!) who wears tight fitting tops and hot pants instead of the white coat.Director Michael Apted seemed an odd choice to me and he has succeeded in making every single scene as dull and leaden and unimpressive as it is possible.Watch this movie only if you are a Bond fan. If you watch them just like any other movie though...do NOT waste your cash.
2,Hollywood FORMULA getting worn down,"The SCRIPT Is Not Enough! Every Bond movie must have a casino -- so right in the middle of the plot (bing!) it cuts right to James Bond being in a casino for no reason at all. It adds nothing to the movie, but he has to make an appearance there. And a hot new car, outfitted with all the gadgets (we're supposed to say ooooh, aaaaaah, niiiice car!) and they destroy it within five minutes of him driving it, before you get a chance to see what it can really do. Nothing new or exciting, just the same old formula randomly patched together. Come off it, let's get something new into the formula, instead of desperately rehashing the best two-minute snippets of every Bond movie that's come before, and hoping it all adds up to a watchable movie! It left me feeling like a cow pushed through the Hollywood stockades. This is the end of this review, so now is the time you are supposed to laugh and smile, and go away feeling good. Consider yourself manipulated."
3,Entertaining but flawed,"Brosnan's third Bond movie, The world is Not Enough, is high on action but weak on plot. Robert Carlyle is a pretty good villain but his motivations seem a bit unclear. Sophie Marceu is also very good as the main Bond girl, while Denise Richards' performance is weak and she's completely miscast.Leonard Maltin wrotethat the movie makes M (Judi Dench) seem foolish, and he's right. From the earlier movies, I took her to be a bright woman, but in this one she's unbelievably stupid, considering she's the head of an intelligence agency (no pun intended).I wish they had done some more rewrites on the script and replaced Denise Richards. It's still an enjoyable movie, but not as good as it could have been."
2,This isn't enough,"Brosnan continues his streak of merely average Bond performances with "" The World is not Enough. "" His voice is generally unassertive, his performance undistinctive and he looks physically meek for the action sequences. This movie just isn't enough.The Bond franchise was dealt a serious blow when Timothy Dalton was lost. Hopefully the 21st Bond film (the one after the next release) will have a different and better actor at the helm. I wouldn't mind seeing Dalton reprise his role for one more run. He was the best Bond of all."
2,Christmas Jones,"Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) ,could this actress have been a bigger moron? Why didn't they jusy hire a cardboard cutout?And what a formulaic assembly of Bond cliches. Good extras on the DVD, though. Gives it an extra star."
3,The Formula Is Too Much,"""The World Is Not Enough"" (1999) had the potential to be one of the best Bonds. It has Pierce Brosnan in solid form, a terrific pre-credit chase sequence, and two of finest 007 villains in years. Unfortunately, the film suffers from a weak Bond heroine (Denise Richards registers zero chemistry with Brosnan) and a predictable, claustrophobic climax. As with ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" the 007 formula undermines the film's potential. It wouldn't hurt if the Bond producers took a few risks or came up with some original ideas."
4,Connery-esque!,"Finally, a Bond movie that brings back the good ol' days!Unfortunately, Denise Richards is soooo attractive you may have to watch it again to understand what happened!Brosnan turns in a good performance -- all in all, a good effort."
5,The World is not Enough,"Bond is back for the 90's and moving very fast into the 21st century, Pierce has brought more to Bond than anyone else since Sean Connery, lets hope he keeps up the British end for a few more years. In the latest Bond film Pierce fight's bad guy's and make's love to some of the most beautiful girl's around what more could you ask from a Bond film stunning locations great fight's and chases and Woman to make your eyes pop out 10 out of 10."
3,Not the best of Pierce Brosnan!,"Oh yes the movie is nice but it can never be compared to his Tomorrow Never Dies!!!The sound track as always in amazing, the acting is well done, is the story is challenging as always but the action is not as good Tomorrow Never Dies!But if you are 007 fan, you've got to buy/rent this DVD no matter what..."
3,the worst Bond Film since live and Let Die,"i find the world is not enough went away from the bond fomula it has no plot to it the twomain bad charcters were very bland pierce Bronsan as james Bond was affford than his two last Bond Films. Irecommend you rent don;t waste your money to buy on Dvd, Vhs"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of the worst Bonds, TWINE features (as everyone knows by now) a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones who is played by Denise Richards, an uninteresting plot, and an overall sense of depressing formula; the villain is interesting but the movie has little else new to offer."
2,A Movie for the Playstation Generation!,"For me the only 'True' bond films belong to the sixties (note: I was born in 1973). My favourite of the lot is 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. Moore and the 70's/80's were a disaster for the series. Dalton was fine but the time was wrong (the 80's).Now we have Brosnan. Brosnan cuts a good figure as Bond, while still leaning a bit too much to Moore for my liking. The last 3 films (espically 'The World is Not Enough) with Brosnan remind me not of a film designed for adults but marketed with a view to the ensuing video game. The film structure is basically that of a Playstation game. We have a opening action sequence which is ideal for the first round of the game. Fast forward to helicopters with saw blades (very inefficent way to kill but great action potential). Level 3 requires you to pick of the bad guys in a old Caviour factory (fogive the spelling) and finally we have the showdown on the nuclear vessel (wow).Not Bond but a game."
1,The World Is Not Enough - Sleep!,"I got VERY disappointed. One pretty woman, one almost pretty. All the rest about the movie is boring, so prepare for a good sleep."
3,it was a let down,"For Bond, the last two movies have left something to be desired. the last vilian wasn't dastardly enough and this one was confusing. sure this movie entertained me and i liked how Q's replacment was introduced, buti guess i am used to Goldeneye quality since it came out. that movie is classic bond if you ask me."
4,Just for the car,I believe the movie is good. But I love the awesome Z8 bond car. I only wish they mass produced the car in America. The Z8 car only is worth giving the movie a view.
2,really less than realistic,"What got me was the handling of weapons grade plutonium with bare hands.Mostly you have to have a clean room with something like leaded glassand a waldo to handle this kind of radiation hazard.If they did what the film showed, they would be dead very quickly.Other than that it is an ordinary bond film.But this kind of mistake in technical things makesme wonder how much other stuff is totally fake as well?Somebody is may believe they can handle weapons grade stuff like this and die?Don't try these stunts at home type of thing...Only after thecold war is over could anyone believe this?"
3,Nothing Special !,"The movie is the same as the previous bond films, and I found it nothing special. However, this DVD is great."
2,Another Bosnan Bomb,"Even allowing for the fact that Sean Connery is the only one who could ever play James Bond (and still could!), this movie was a real sleeper. The usual Russian bomb threats yada yada yada. Character development is non-existent, the plot is twisted and confused, and the movie depends entirely too much on special effects. The original 007 movies did not need as many special effects because the characters were well-defined and interesting and Sean Connery was fun and amusing to watch. His Bond had just enough evil in him to make him a believable character with a license to kill. Brosnan, a fine actor otherwise, seems more angry than anything else and by this time is just going through the motions and making sure that Rolex and BMW get plenty of exposure. The film contains quite a number of fine actors from the BBC, but they are not utilized fully. And one hopes the writing for future films will be better, otherwise they're simply not fit to be called Bond films--James Bond films!"
2,A DVD feature review.,"First let me state I'm a huge James Bond fan, I've seen them all. I could go on for pages why I didn't like this film much, and the rating reflects that, but I'll just give a few comments on the DVD extras. First the introduction is too obnoxious and there is no way to skip past it. The very short, 15 minute, 'making of' feature was more like a 'E!' feature from TV with some rather boring interviews with some of the cast and crew. The 'secrets' section was very interesting with storyboards combined with unfinished scenes that showed what the shots looked like before final production. The video by Garbage is very good too. It's a great song although short. The music video isn't just cut scenes from the movie, although it has them, but a whole little story in itself. Finally a big oversight in my book is a lack of English subtitles, although French and Spanish is included. Overall a good DVD production too bad the movie wasn't as good."
2,Sad,"If id known this Bond would be so mediocre, I would have ordered Goldeneye, even though i saw that Bond installment already. The DVD has some nice features, and the audio was more than I expected, but the movie, as one reviwer put it, does put you to sleep. I hope they continue this movie series, and with PB at that, but i hope they are are able to get back the ambiance that Goldeneye and TND had."
4,A real Bond Movie,"I like this movie, it's the first Bond Movie with Pierce Brosnan that i like. The story is in the beginning what vage but it is entertaning until the end. This is one of the Bond movies you just have to see."
1,utter trash,"this was by far the worst bond film ever. i thought they couldn't get worse than a view to a kill or the man with the golden gun but it did. First problem was with electra charachter(this isn't Greek tragedy she was a villian to get revenge on her father and she was in love with renard"" what a lame idea for a villiness. the second problem it had no plot. third problem brosnan was just not putting anything to the role. The movie was just pointless loud violent garbage. goldeneye was ok, tnd was good(it had some plot) but this was utter stupidity."
4,my fav Bond film so far....,This Bond film is fun and loaded with special effects. A good Bond film. Score: 92/100
1,One of the worst in a storied series,"There have been a lot of ups and downs in the storied Bond series, which is to be expected with so many different installments being made. That being said, this is definitley one of the valleys, right down there with Licence to Kill and Moonraker. The plot is terrible, Richards is much better on mute and Brosnan doesn't appear to be given anything to work with. Just because you can assemble a few attractive women, some tech. toys and a madman doesn't mean that you have a Bond film. While Brosnan's reign started strong with Goldeneye and only dipped a bit with Tomorrow Never Dies, it hit the toilet with this one. The best Bonds are more than simply an action film- it needs to be a moviegoing experience. Sadly the only experience this leaves the viewer with is the urge to turn the tv off."
1,You'll fall asleep,"A sad day for Bond fans. Looks like director Michael Apted and his team ran out of time and ideas, and had to wrap up something -- anything -- to hand over to the studio. Respectable talents and serious money were squandered on this dull, confusing, flat-as-a-pancake film. If it's true that the Bond series has become a mechanical cliche', the least it should do is deliver the goods every Summer. Instead, this one will put you to sleep.A word about the cast. We've seen virtually all of these actors before, and they're clearly a capable bunch. So the fault of TWINO was not in the casting, but in the plot and direction.Over the years, Brosnan's Bond has grown more self-confident and a little tougher-edged, whereas the film production team seems to be getting confused and softer. Perhaps an injection of fresh film-making talent (behind the camera) is what the doctor ordererd to rejuvenate this tired, stiff series."
3,Whatever Happenned to the old James Bond movies,"You know what I mean, the ones with truly memorable villians, and truly interesting sidekicks.TWINE really doesn't have either. I was never really in fear for Bond's life, or anyone else's for that matter. This was a strictly by the numbers Bond movie. And while that's not all bad, it definitely is not a good thing either.I mean I was wishing for _Goldeneye_.Still it's a decent flick for what it is, so I will give it three stars."
3,Overly complicated.,"I don't know about you, but I found this movie hard to follow. The plot is confusing and, as I previously stated, overly complicated. The action was fast, furious and well staged, but gee whiz... what the hell was it all about? Something about altering the route of a new European pipeline to another country so this lady can get rich but before that, her father dies because of some guy who can't feel pain and blah, blah, blah...! What is this? Although it was good to see Judi Dench get more screen time because she's actually a part of the plot, matters were made worse with an anti-climactic ending. In action films, pay-off is everything. This movie had no pay-off. I wasn't expecting the movie to end when it did. Well enough of the criticism. I didn't hate ""The World is Not Enough"" but next time I'd prefer more well-defined villians with more straightforward goals for world domination. This MOVIE was ""not enough""."
5,Best Bond Film of All Time,"""The World is Not Enough"" is the most powerful James Bond film of all time. It has the greatest special effects, action, and best acting. It has the taste of all the James Bond movies in one. Q is great as always,especially, when he tells Bond, ""This is my vacation boat"", of course Bond will destroy the boat, almost. Bond is on a special adventure to find out what really happened, yet a mystery. This movie has everything a movie needs to be classic."
2,For 007 this movie is not enough,"It wasn't charming as the first ones and, considering how ""special effects"" have improved in the past years, the new movie isn't trilling as it ancestors. If it wasn't for ""good old times"", I wouldn't even care to buy such a movie."
5,"the world is not enough, but it is a perfect place to start","This is a great Bond outing. It has it all: action, suspense, betrayel, and did I mention great stunts. The plot is hard to follow and the women aren't rememberable. The villian Renard is great. ... can't feel pain. There are great scenes in the film. The awesome boat chase in the begining. The ski chase on the mountain with the parahawks. Also has a great video game. If you want a great Bond adventure with more action than you can shot a Walther at. You need The World Is Not Enough."
3,The world is not enough.,The world is not enough is the latest bond movie but it has alot to answer for. It is more of an action movie than a spy movie. I give it a 3 for its poor story line. The soundtrack is great though!
5,James Bond the quintissential Spy,"Yet again James Bond has returned, played by Pierce Brosnan. I am without doubt extremely biased towards JB as I love all of his movies and can find no fault in them. They are all without doubt brilliant. In ""The World is not Enough"" he returns with extreme clout. Apart from the pathetic performance of Denise Richards who was obviously chosen for her bra size and not her acting ability the movie was a renounding sucess. I suggest that if you are a true Bond fan that you buy it and own it, as I am slowly doing with all Bond DVD's. It is an expensive habit, but I intend to own them all. James Bond will go on for ever and I am already looking forward to his future exploits"
2,the worst Bond film since the lincess to kill,"Pierce Bronsoan was Okay as bond in this film. it starts off good than it fells right apart. i thinks sophica manance was badfor therole of mrs king. my fartorive sences is wnen Bond jumps out of the window. don't was your money on the DVD,or video just rent it it's woth the $2.45 at your video store Tomorrow Never Dies, GoldFinger, The Living Daylights are better Bond Films than this one."
3,GOOD JAMES BOND,PIERCE BROSNAN IS VERY GOOD AS JAMES BOND ; AFTER SEAN CONNERY IS THE BEST IN THIS ROLE.HOWEVER A LITTLE BIT TO MUCH VIOLENCE IN THIS JAMES BOND COMPARE TO THE OTHERS AND THE CHOICE OF SOPHIE MARCEAU AS ONE OF THE JAMES BOND GIRL IS POOR. SHE JUST DOESN'T PLAY WELL ; THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT HER IS HER GOOD LOOKING BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP A MOVIE.
3,"Better, but room for improvement","This is a good film, but it still lacks a good plot, and is nowhere near any of Daltons films. Brosnan gives one of his best performances as Bond, but its all to CRASH BANG WALLOP, and not enough feeling. Whatever happened to ACTING? Denise Richards is sweet, everyones dream Christmas, but a nuclear scientist? I'm not convinced. Ends on a joke that would even make Roger Moore cringe!"
2,"I hate BROSNAN and love DALTON , but marceau is HOT","This time out, 007 is investigating the death of some guy named King, who was actually blown up inside Bond's M16 headquarters. Bond tries to kill a woman sniper that was firing at him,but she blows herself up too. The opening scene is too long and not good compared to the rest of them. Denise Richards is AWFUL as well as pretty much everybody else in this movie except Elektra King(Marceau)who is one of the best Bond girls since the 80's. I do not understand why we had to go from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan. I mean Pierce was good in the Lawnmower Man, but he just is not heading Bond in the right direction. When Dalton took the reigns from Roger Moore, there was a refreshing little bit of originality and seriousness. MGM cares more about money and box office popularity then they do about doing the GREAT IAN FLEMING'S original character justice."
2,Disappointing,"Clearly, the makers of this movie wanted to make Bond more visceral and emotional. The best way of looking at the film is as a transition from the suave, elegant Bond of tradition to Daniel Craig's tougher, more brutish incarnation. Too bad the movie was so poorly done. Brosnan does his best with second-rate double entendres but he isn't given much else to work with: the action sequences are forced, heavy, and over-long; the plot is thin; and, no matter how lovely Denise Richards is, there is no disguising the fact that she can't act. The only good part of the movie is Miss Moreau: a rewrite turning her into the central villain would have made for a much better movie."
1,The World Is Enough......To Put Me To Sleep,"This movie was so ridiculously lame. You will actually be dumber after watching it. Granted, Pierce Brosnan is a fine actor who is probably the best choice to play 007, but the script was sub-par and plotline was an insult to any human's intelligence.The action sequences were predictable, albeit intense, but very contrived and hokey. The sinister villain was a goof on a weekend pass who wasn't scary at all.And what's up with one of his his love interest's name? Christmas Jones? Give me a break! To hear that was just a capper on an overall turkey of a film. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,Not enough. More than enough.,And you thought Roger Moore was naff. He had all the stiffness of an insurance salesman and about half the charm. James Bond is so unhip I'm surprised he doesn't wheel himself around on a trolley and bite the ankles of his enemy. A very dated figure when you put him up against 'The Matrix'. I use 'The Matrix' as a template for everything despite the fact I don't think it's a terribly good film.Bond shows a novel way of getting around the capitol's dire traffic congestion early on in the proceedings. If our present Mayor has his way then he won't get halfway down the street without stopping to pay a toll in the next one. Then after that he'll be stopped again to check his equity card for authenticity after this debacle. Double O severence pay is in order for this tired series. It's making me embarrassed to be British.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the absoulute worst bond film made! The villian has a bullet in his head? HE GOTTA BE DEAD!!!!!! And Pierce Brosnan did great in ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomoroww Never Dies"" but horrible in ""The World Is Not Enough"" he's 40 years old and he's having sex with about every girl he sees. The Action is the only good thing in this film. Do not waste your time wacthing this stupid movie. THUMBS DOWN TO ""The World is Not Enough"""
2,Very Disappointing After Tomorrow Never Dies,"I thought TND was among the best Bonds, right up there with The Spy Who Loved Me (Well, not quite). But this one is a major step backwards, although not as low as A View To A Kill, which is doubtless the worst of them all.The plot is boring and far too drawn out. The final payoff is very weak. Denise Richards is a babe, but when she comments that Bond is ""No Nuclear Scientist"", she is really taking about herself.Bronson is all right, but some new writers are needed for the next one."
2,Least likeable Bond,"Brosnan brings a cold, souless quality to Ian Fleming's creation in ""The World is Not Enough"". There is something sad about a 40-ish man who has sex with anyone and everyone. He reminds me of a stray dog running around a neighborhood trying to hump any female dogs he comes across. At least Sean Connery, when he began the role, was in his early 30's, making the promiscuous behavior seem a little less pathetic. Connery didn't take himself as seriously as Brosnan does, either. He injected a bit of humor into his portrayal.I give the film 2 stars because of the excellent chase scene, but I think it's time for a younger James Bond. Let's let Christian Bale, Jude Law, Orlando Bloom or someone else have a crack at the role."
2,The only thing worth seeing in this movie is...,"Nope, not the acting. It's the car. This is by far the worst of the last three Bond films. The acting by all the main characters seems either flat or out of place. Especially Denise Richards. Horrible casting job there...As for the action sequences, they aren't unique or interesting enough to distance themselves from other Hollywood action flicks. Maybe it is just me, but I really think that the entire franchise needs to re-invent itself. Again, if you must watch the movie, look for the new BMW Z8. That thing is a work of beauty and easily steals all the scenes it is involved in..."
1,Worst Bond film ever,It's a good thing that guys like George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan are so good looking because they couldn't get a job sweeping streets in Hollywood based upon their talent. Please read David Talamantes review because it is so accurate I had to laugh when I read it and I definitely don't want to waste any more time on this film than I already have.
1,Worst of the Bunch.,"This Bond movie is quite possibly the worst of the entire series. The plot is incredibly lacking, and Brosnan's acting is horrible (unless you compare it with that of Richard's, who has no business being in a movie at all). The only thing this movie had to offer was the appearance of R (John Cleese, incredibly funny man), Q's replacement. After this movie, I am hoping Brosnan will step down as Bond and not do a fourth. He disgraced the series with this one (though I suppose the writers should take most of the blame)."
4,"Good Bond movie, but lacking something....","This was a solid James Bond movie, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that it could have been better. The action tends to dwindle a bit towards the end and the climatic fight between Bond and the bad guy ends seems to end before it even begins. Great casting and excellent music make this a very classy Bond film but I was left feeling that something was missing at the end. Tommorow Never Dies grew on me after repeated watchings, so I guess TWINE will too after a while, but I didn't walk away from this thinking it will reign as one of the best Bond flicks. It's definitely worth seeing but I think if you're like me, when the movie fades to black there is going to be a little dissapointment. All I can say is I hope Bond will be back and things will get a little more shaken up in the plot department, not stirred."
4,The World is not Enough,"I'm a diehard James Bond fan, but for my money the best Bonds are (in the following order): Sean Connery (of course); Daniel Craig (Pleasantly, and surprisingly, good as Bond (my favorite since Sean Connery relinquished the role). Closer to the Bond character in the original books); and Pierce Brosnan. Honorable mention: Timothy Dalton."
2,parody of a bond film,"What's happened to these bond films? They've become almost a parody of themselves. Almost like the old batman series. They are such by the numbers plot line. Another ski chase, another boat chase. Which one was the film where he blows up the bad guy? All of them! After about 20 films they all look alike. Especially the last few. How about bond going after an average plain vanilla bad guy? Instead of exotic locales how about an adventure in Podunk, Iowa? Honestly, these movies are a blast, but can we have some ""originality"" and ""creativity""?"
2,heres something new,"This is the first time I've seen an action movie where the scenes in between the action sequences were actually more interesting than the action! Do we really need to see Bond being chased on skis yet again? Yawn. But the moments where he was merely trading harsh words with the villians were riviting- at least for me. By the way Electra really had Bonds number down, and thats why his cold heart melted a little bit for her in the end (a nice touch), not like Christmas who was just a one night stand."
4,Not as great as normal...but recommended.,"This one is a long one, but most Bond films are. I'm happy they kept someone with a real accent and the costars did an excellent job!"
2,No premium bond!,"This film for me simply doesnt work as a Bond film!It lacks the sauave and sophistication of the Connery/Moore era and the gritty realism of the Dalton era.Brosnan makes an ok bond,but this is far from an ok bond film!The plot is wafer thin,coming very close to being as bad as that of tomorrow never dies!The action sequences are few and far between,and those you do get are unrealistic and shoddy!As for the Bond car,it is on screen for mere seconds before being sliced in half!This is a film that won't live up to expectations,lets just hope Bond 20 is better than this poor effort!Avoid this,buy Living daylights or the man with the golden gun instead.But if you must have a Brosnan film,go for Goldeneye,probably Brosnans best effort!"
1,Once is much too much,I bought this movie. You should rent this and you won't feel as ripped off as I do. Close to the worst Bond yet.
2,"""The World"" is not nearly enough ... to make up for this.","I was very excited to see this new installment of James Bond b/c of the two femmes. But during its viewing I realized that this was nothing more than dumb. I have come to the conclusion that i dont care much for the recent Bonds ... they really havent struck my fancy in any way, but I would like to think that one day i will again. Now Peirce has the looks and accent for Bond and does it fine ... as for the co-stars ... Denise Richards is one of my favorites, but who would believe her to be such an eccentric, Robert Carlyle is a villain to forget ... BUT! The one new and great thing i think was the very talented Sophie Marceau ... She had her own style that ravished ... only that was the only thing ... and it couldnt save the world ... even if there was enough."
4,The world's just fine,"Finally pre- cold war Bond-film with great tune and even better cast. Of course, Pierce Brosnan can't win when copared to Sean Connery, but in spite of wonderful cast, he's better than Roger Moore. Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane and Judi Dench cant help it: Brosnan looks like an extra when compared to them. Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau are like Brosnan: you can barely tell them from the backround. Good actors and good theme make this the best Bond of Brosnan (no thanks to Brosnan himself!). p.s. John Cleese makes a wonderful cameo as R. I'm glad he will be the one to replace Desmond Llewellyn (may he rest in peace)."
3,The World Is Not Enough,"I saw this movie and theaters and wasn't to impressed. There needed to be more gadgets and stuff. However it was ok. I liked Q in the movie. Also, there needed to be more car scens."
5,The very best bond movie ever!,Pierce Brosnan is the best bond ever. I loved Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies. This movie is even better. I like Roger Moore and all the others bond movies a lot. This one is even better than Goldfinger and that is saying a lot. I can't wait to see the next one.
3,Not as good as expected.,"While this movie was incredibly awesome, and totally unpredicatable, it had to few action scenes. (they show all of them in the previews) but as the plot thickens, you can really get into the movie. A little more disgusting as in this movie, the bad guy walks around with a bullet in his head, but still excellent. Keep little ones at home for this one! Excellent, though! Pierce Brosnan stuns the screen. My favorite scene was when he has see through glasses. Excellent sense of humor. :-)"
2,Frustrated,Beware....I am on my second sweater from this book and with both sweaters there were mistakes in the instructions. It's been incredibly frustrating. I won't buy another book from Zoe Mellor.
1,"Beautiful designs, but terrible results","I made the sweater on the front cover. It's a beautiful design, but the neck opening is way too small and my daughter (3 yrs) does not have a big head. I couldn't even get it on her so I had to modify one shoulder seam to add a zipper. Also the body of the sweater is about 4 inches too long (which on a 3 year old is significant).I thought perhaps I had knitted it incorrectly, but my girlfriend had exactly the same problems with her sweater too.Zoe Mellor's designs are quite beautiful, but don't judge this book by it's cover like I did. Her patterns are just not in proportion. I spent many, many hours only to be sorely dissapointed in the finished product. If I had spent more money on yarn, I would be down right bitter."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"1. This book has beautiful projects.2. They are not all easy.3. I am a very experienced knitter.4. I am making the dots and stripes baby blanket as a gift for my niece.5. I am eliminating the dots because if there was another color change or another bobbin on my needles (12!) I was going to scream and tear my hair out. There is a slight possibility that I may duplicate-stitch them in when/if I'm done.6. There are so many ends to weave in that the reverse side will have to be backed with fabric or another knit piece in order to make it givable.7. I doubt I will try to make another project from this book, but if the author reads this and thinks maybe I'm going about it all the wrong way, I'd appreciate an e-mail. I want to like it, I really do."
1,FRUSTRATION!,"I am also an experienced knitter and have done quite a bit of cable work, but I have found the Robin Hood Jacket extremely frustrating. I feel like the author was too lazy to put everything into one graph or set of instructions. Instead I spend my time flipping pages trying to figure out where I am in the regular row and where I am in the cable rows. I have to force myself to pick up this project. If I hadn't put so much money into the yarn I would probably chuck it. I will not make another project from this book. I should have read the reviews before buying."
2,"Pretty pictures, bizarre patterns...","Okay, I started with the star sweater on the cover. Nothing is knit on the round. Six months later, I have the pieces of the sweater sitting in a bag waiting to be finished. Every time I try to get into the pattern, I get annoyed and give up. The hats in the back? Super cute but not knit on the round! WTH, a pilot hat knit flat?I even ordered the yarn from the UK for the striped hat. I just put the needles down and came to type this review. I made it past the ear-flaps just to notice there was no joining of this hat.*grumble, grumble.This was my first pattern book. I usually buy my patterns on etsy. Yeah, I do not think I will buy another pattern book.At least the photos are pretty."
2,Mistakes galore,"I love the patterns, but the number of mistakes is frustrating. You should probably only buy this book if you are an experienced knitter and can pre-read patterns to figure out where errors might be. If you are planning to knit one of the cabled patterns, you should be prepared to waste a ball of yarn before you find out where all the errors are. I've knitted for ten years, and I've never encountered so many mistakes in a published pattern book before. Proceed with caution."
1,Frustrating,"I bought this book because of the unique, beautiful knits I hoped to produce. I have used Debbie Bliss' and The Yarn Girls' Guide to Kid Knits with no problems and great results. I expected the same results and was disappointed with this book. I tried to knit the sweater on the cover using the correct yarn and needle size (5). The proportions of the sweater were off by several inches and I had to rip the whole thing out. I have tried to find corrections to the pattern online but have found none."
1,agony,[...]this was the poorest written piece of drivel i've picked up in years. it is geared to the pre-school level in it's presentation-rarely was a grammatical contraction used-as if to lengthen an empty plot and storyline. my first grade primer had more interest.save your $
2,So disappointed,"I am reading this now, and quite honestly, if I had something else in the house to read, I would throw this over! I was looking so forward to this book. It seems that each book in this ""series"" is weaker than the last. I find the characters annoying, not charming as I did in the original book. I guess there is such a thing as too much ya ya...."
1,Where Was Rebecca Wells Going?,"I think she has beaten this YaYa dead horse enough. Loved her first two books, but this disjointed sprinkling of stories that led no where left me confused and more than a little sorry that I bought the hardcover. Her characters have become sterotypical, predictable, single-faceted Southerners and even her writing style seemed very elementary. I felt like I was riding a roller coaster that I couldn't wait to get off."
2,The Bloom Has Faded,"As a fan of the Sisterhood, I've been eagerly awaiting Ya-Ya's In Bloom. Unfortunately, I've been very disappointed. It is found lacking in comparison. The characters have no depth and are not very interesting. So, fellow readers, I might just skip this one."
2,Ya-Yas are Wilting,"Save your time and money. I got this at the library and made it about 3/4 of the way through. A real disappointment after enjoying the first two books so much. The book has no plot and no point, except maybe to gloss over some of the horrors of the Walker family home life presented in Little Altars Everywhere. I found myself wondering if Wells had just glued together anecdotes from the Ya-Yas lives that she had previously edited out of the Divine Secrets book because they didn't really ""work""."
2,Tres Dissapointing,"Did Rebecca Wells just take the chapters she had cut from her previous books and use them to paste together this travesty? I am giving this book 2 stars because I adored the other two so much that it was worth sitting through this boring, melodramatic, and poorly edited Lifetime Movie to be able to revisit the other characters, but it really and truly sucked.Why did she pretty up all of the characters? Wasn't Vivi molesting Little Shep in ""Little Alters""? Were we supposed to forget about it (and her many other flaws) with this newer, gentler and kinder Vivi Abbot? Could the story of how the YaYa's met have been any less magical?Oh, I am bitterly sad. ""What becomes a legend most"", Ms. Wells? Respecting the world you created through writing and the readers who were so transfixed and loyal to this world, andwriting a sequel that shows this. Not churning out this jagged, spiritless, clap-trap jumble of reheated crap you foisted on us. I feel betrayed and I am not impressed."
3,Very Disappointed,"Definitely not worth the wait. This much anticipated follow-up to ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" reads like a series of personal family vignettes and remembrances instead of a plotted novel. I was very disappointed. It was nice reading at the first of the book how the Ya-Ya's met as children, but the story quickly went downhill from there and became tedious and boring. Save your money and check it out from the library. I wish I had."
2,Do yourself a favor ....,"Skip reading this book. I was not a huge fan of the Divine Secrets Of the Ya Ya Sisterhood but I did manag to finish reading the book and I also watched the movie. After reading over 200 of the 258 pages in Ya Yas in Bloom, I could not go on any more and I had to quit.There are countless chapters that dont really have much to do with the history of the Ya Yas and I found them pointless to even have in the book. There was no real humor and I found these women to be more irritating than anything else, especially Vivi.I am so happy I borrowed this from the library because I would have kicked myself for spending good money on a book this bad."
2,The weeds pulled from the earlier books,"Rebecca Wells must have been bugged senseless to write another book. So she dug up all the pieces that were culled from her previous two books and slapped them together with duct tape and sent it to her editor. That's the only way I can deduce that this book came about. It has no flow, it leaves random loose ends, and there is suddenly a ""plot"" two-thirds of the way into the book. Is it enjoyable? Enough to rate two stars. Get it from the library."
2,"Vote for strange, not deranged.",Not nearly as good as the first two in the series. There's a bit of feminist hogwash and gun politics at the end which is distracting from the story. I also didn't like the way she made the original YaYas seem a bit on the deranged side.
2,Not an impressive sequel,"Add me to the list as well. I was not impressed. Ms. Wells drew us in with Divine Secrets and made us care about the characters so much that we all clamored for a sequel. Unfortunately, after the long wait to hear more, this is what we got. I think Ms. Wells may have been out of good ideas for our beloved characters."
1,Ya-Ya's in Bloom does nothing for me...,"It's a darn shame! I loved the first two books in the Ya-Ya Sisterhood trilogy, but this one seemed so rushed. The lack of character development was embarrassing. This collection of stories lacked any sort of focus, other than"" well, here's more stories about the Ya-Ya's and their offspring."" The final story, ""A Star's A Seed A Seed's A Star"" about a family holiday was dreadful to read. I had to keep referring to other stories trying to figure out who all of the characters were. I wonder if Rebecca Wells' publisher was pushing her to just get it done. If that's the case, I feel sorry for her, but she should have pushed back for the sake of a good story and a great product. This book stunk!"
2,Disappointing,I bought this in spite of the reviews I read because I loved the first two so much. This really lacks the humor and wit and true character of the first two Ya Ya books. Boring and with a plot twist that just goes nowhere. Save your money.
1,Terribly disappointing,"As a big fan of Ms. Wells' first two books about the denizens of Thornton, LA, I was looking forward to reading more about characters I so loved. For example, I was hoping for some reconciliation of the good Vivi (who loved her kids so much) and the bad Vivi (who abused them and herself). I was hoping for an understanding in this third installment of how I as a reader can love such a flawed character.What I got was more of the same ""lets be wacky and isn't that fun"". I thought there was more to all the Ya-yas and their families. There was a tenderness found in the other two books that is lacking here. Not much more depth to the characters is developed.The careless editing will make even the most casual reader cringe.Save your money. If you are hoping to learn more about these lovely characters, you will be disappointed."
2,"Seems like the ""best of the ya-yas""","Luckily I didn't buy this book. I was on the waiting list at the library and couldn't wait to read it once it was my turn. I have had the book for over a week now and have no desire to finish it.Although it's written in an easy to read style, I was EXTREMELY disappointed by lack of originality. Many of the ya yas adventures are recapped and told from a different viewpoint. Some new ones are added, but some of the narrative is so lengthy, by the time you get to the point you don't really care what it is anyway.The book reads like a collection of short stories, with each story being told by someone else. In that sense, if you just want a quick ya ya fix, this is the book for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for an interesting story with a good plot and interesting characters, read the first ya ya book and don't bother with this recap."
1,shelley in san diego,"EEEH GADS! TERRIBLE!!! The PERFECT example of an author trying to capitalize on a hit seller... and, the result is AWFUL!!! A giant mish mash of no connection or cohesiveness... just awful! Shame on the editor for even putting this book out... it's just a way to take away our hard earned dollars!"
2,Not Wells' usual laughter provoking story.,"It does seem as though some writers are stuck with their characters and in this case, it is just the younger generation we read about. I loved the first Ya-Ya tale, enjoyed the second, but was bored to pieces on this latest. Having roots in Louisiana and knowing how southern girls hang together, I could relate to the first two books, but this one was a terrific disappointment and waste of time. Luckily it was very short and a quick read. Please Ms. Wells do better if you try for a fourth Ya Ya book. One of these days, I will write a rave review."
4,A New Fan,"Having never read the two books that came before this one, I can't possibly compare it. However, I have become a fan of the Ya Ya's and immediately after finishing this book, went to the library and took out the first two in the series. Yes, there are some characters added only to plump up the story line and they could easily have been eliminated, but the southern charm of the main characters won me over. My one big complaint was trying to keep track of all the children the author felt necessary to briefly touch upon. I stopped trying to figure out who belonged to who. I also agree with a previous reviewer about how many editorial mistakes I found. This galls me more then anything in a book that has supposedly been read and reread by the authors editor et al."
2,"Ya Ya, Bla Bla",I was disappointed in this book especially since Ya Ya Sisterhood was so good. I think the author was trying to add more to the Ya Ya books but it didn't work. It's kind of like a movie part 2 that is bad! Don't waste your time!
1,Terrible.,"Did the author simply take the chapters that did not make it into the other two books to create this colossal disappointment? I bought four hardcovers at the same time-this and The Ice Queen, Lost in the Forest, and The Mermaid Chair. I'd recommend ALL of the other three, Lost in the Forest in particular. Steer clear of this one even if you are a die hard Ya-Ya fan. You will honestly wonder if you enjoyed the previous tomes as much as you thought...this is shallow and not worth your $."
3,Don't bother unless you love the Ya-Ya's,"This isn't really a novel, per se. Rather, it's a ""family album format"" where the point of view shifts frequently and there is no unifying theme or plot. There is an attempt at a plot concerning the kidnapping of a Tres Petit Ya-Ya (translation: grandchild of the Ya-Ya), but this only takes up about twenty-five pages. As if uncertain what to do next, Wells goes back and retells the kidnapping incident from another character's point of view.So there is no overarching dramatic question, no lasting suspense or mystery to keep you reading. What might keep you reading is if you love the Ya-Ya's and enjoy their company. This book probably works best if you approach it like a night with friends around the fire: cozy, relaxing, with the different friends telling stories, but it's not a novel."
1,Waaah! I'll never get those three hours back!!,"I read ""Divine Secrets"" after resisting its hype. I thought I was too above it all to read a fluffy tale about Southern women. I was a snob about it. But that book drew me in, made me laugh and cry, enfolded me like a blanket. And it resonated with me, which surprised me greatly. I also liked ""Little Altars"" because I thought Wells was rather brave to explore some of the more disturbing aspects of the Walker/Abbot clan.So, I certainly did want to like this book. But I was disappointed. Like a bunch of loosely constructed afterthoughts, no substance, it bored me. A hilarious word picture or bon mot here and there does not represent a well-constructed novel. The Christmas play at the end--- ugh! I was actually fidgeting in embarassment.Time for the Yayas to hang it up, cherie...."
4,Ya-Ya Short Stories,"This book is less of a novel than it is a collection of vignettes about the Ya-Yas and those around them. I realize I am going against the grain of 99% of those who have written reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Rebecca Wells recaptures the spirit and spontaneous craziness of the four life-long friends, and fills in a few blanks in our knowledge, such as how the girls met and became friends in the first place. It might have been better if this book had been marketed as a group of short stories because, although there are some ties between chapters, most of the stories stand alone. I laughed out loud at some of the adventures of the Ya-Yas and their progeny and the book evoked the same sense of enjoyment I felt at being let in on their world in the first two books. This is not a novel in the conventional sense, but it does bring the reader back to the world of these four unconventional women and the friendships which sustain them throughout their lives."
2,Add my name to the others,"I won't bother with a recap of this storyline since it has been done by many other reviewers.I would agree, however, with the reviewers who commented that somehow this book does not have the charm and wit of the previous books.It is a shame as this book has been a long time in coming, but it may be time to retire the Ya-Yas or at the very least make them alot more entertaining than in this one."
1,Just plain awful,"I had been a big fan of the Ya Yas and Rebecca Wells, so it was with much anticipation that I began this latest book. Unfortunately, like most sequels, it was a big disappointment. I could barely finish it. The story line was virtually non-existant; it lacked the humor and wit of the other books; and it was laden with too many random characters and child point-of-view narrations that drove me crazy. The bloom isn't even a bud, but some kind of droopy, dead stem that never quite had the gusto to live. Don't waste the money on this. I did and it definitely wasn't worth it at all."
2,"Started out good, but went nowhere!","I liked the beginning of the book in which we find out how the four Ya-Ya's friendships started way back when they were little girls. But then the book strays away from all that and into a bunch of boring crap about the ""Petites Ya-Yas."" The rest of the book should have been called something like ""Things the Petites Ya-Yas Did,"" because the majority of this book wasn't about the Ya-Yas growing up at all."
3,A bit disappointing..,"I was a bit disappointed with Ms. Well's 3rd book. Her previous 2 Ya-Ya books were so good that I had high expectations which resulted in disappointment.The stories read like loose journal pages. They all had different authors. It also seemed like the Ya-Ya families all got along ""perfectly"" which we all know from the previous books was not always the case. The only real action is in 2 stories... one where Vivi hits the statue of the Jesus and 2 comes when Neice's petite ya-ya was kidnapped.If this were a movie I'd say wait until the video comes out since it's not, I guess I'd say wait until you can get it from the public library or until it comes out on Mass-paperback.I do hope that Ms. Well learns from this flob and comes back with another ""HIT""....Happy Reading!"
2,SO FAR NOT SO GOOD,"This book does not hold a candle to the previous ones. It seems to be going over plowed ground as we say in Texas. I am just glad I bought the book used and saved some money, I am half way through and see no reason to continue. I was very disappointed as I loved Divine Secrets..I thought Little Altars was too 'dark' and had i read it first I probably might never had read Divine Secrets..I don't see a bit of enlightenment in this book..maybe just a 'potboiler'? Cynthia Smith, Johnson City, Texas"
2,"I really, really, really wanted to love it.","...But I couldn't. It gets two stars because it was nice to visit with these ladies again. Like with all of my favorite series it's fun to check back in with ""friends"". Ms. Wells, you are a great writer...please start a new series soon!"
2,WHO IS THE EDITOR ???,"I have found errors in books before but I have never seen anything quite like this. It looks as if the book was written so fast that NO ONE proof read it. I read Blood brother and found a few errors in it, but the book was good and I was o.k. with it. I then read Whispers of the wicked saints and found an error on the back cover, but that book was so incredible that I just didn't care. This book however was a complete joke. The writting was poor and the stories were old and I am angry that this writer thinks her fans are crazy enough to ever purchase anything like this again. Like I said one or two errors in a good book, no big deal. But this was crazy !!!!!!!!!!"
1,Sequel for Money,"This is an obvious case of the author using the loyalty of her fan base to create a sequel for money. I don't like being used, and my loyalty to Wells is over after reading this book. To read a disappointing book occasionally is to be expected, but as another reviewer wrote,""Did the author simply take the chapters that did not make it into the other two books to create this colossal disappointment?"" My thoughts exactly. The charm of the Ya Ya's ended with this one. Don't waste your money buying it or your time reading it."
4,Not quite as Ya-Ya as the first two,"This third book was not quite as funny as the first two. There was less of the originals, and not quite enough of the Petites. HOWEVER, the last chapter, with the Christmas pageant, was laugh out loud funny enough to redeem the whole book. I have not laughed like that to description of a pageant since the classic ""The Best Christmas Pageant Ever."" Rebecca Wells has created a remarkable cast, and does her best when describing the original Ya-Yas. I look forward to hearing more of their tales."
1,Won't be finishing it.,"I was so excited to see this book at my local book store, since I enjoyed the first two Ya-Ya books so much. I started it as soon as I got home, and was immediately disappointed. I kept reading, thinking that it would improve. Wrong! Could this possibly be the same author who wrote Little Altars and Divine Secrets?? Hard to believe. The writing style is completely different - another reader said ""cheesy"" and I agree. It lacks the richness of the first two books. What happened to Rebecca Wells from the time she finished Divine Secrets and started this book? Luckily it was 50% off! Maybe I'll be able to get $6.00 for it when I sell it at Half-Price Books."
2,Well *I* liked it!,"Didn't love it, but I liked it. Not as emotion-churning as the other 2 Ya Ya books, and that's ok. The kidnapping thing was a tad over the top, but then so are the Ya Yas."
1,Boring and trite.,"The first novel was magnificent. The second one was pretty good. This one is not worth your money. Wells is trying far too hard to make the characters funny and touching in this book. It comes off trite and cheesy, especially the last story, which is positively smarmy.The portrayal of African-Americans in this book is borderline racist and stereotyped. Southern black people are not half-wits. I half expected one of the black characters to bust out with a ""Mo' biscuits, mastah?""Another reviewer had it right when she called the main characters ""caricatures"" of themselves; that's exactly what they are.Don't bother with this one."
2,Tres blah...,"I loved ""Divine Secrets"" and ""Little Altars"" and now I think I will have to re-read them in order to erase the memory of Wells' latest book. As the other reviewers said, there was no substance or depth of character. There were glimmers of the charm found in the other two books, such as Baylor's story, but these were few and far between. The Christmas pageant at the end was excrutiatingly bad. I have to wonder if the author dashed this book off at the publisher's request."
2,Ya-Ya no,"This book has the feel of desperation -- Wells attempting to cash in on two successful previous books, and failing miserably. She recycles many of the anecdotes in the other books, expanding on them unnecesarily. Wells chooses to expand on minor characters from the other books, such as Edythe Spevey -- while ignoring the fate of Sidda and Connor, who finally reconciled and wed at the end of Divine Secrets. More readers would undoubtedly like to hear about the newlyweds, esp. given the turmoil they experienced before. But aside from a few quick mentions, Siddalee may as well no longer exist.Sorry, Ms. Wells, but you should have quit while you were still ahead..."
1,TRES DISAPPOINTING,"I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SEQUEL-IT'S NOT WHAT I WAS YEARNING FOR. MOST OF THE STORY IS BUILT AROUND THEMES FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO BOOKS BUT SLIGHTLY MORE DESCRIPTIVE. THERE IS NOT A LOT OF NEW STORY TO SINK YOUR TEETH INTO. I ALSO FELT LIKE THE AUTHOR TRIED TO ""PRETTY UP"" PREVIOUS CHARACTERS WHO I FELT WERE MORE REAL. THIS VIVI STILL CUSSES BUT IS NOT THE CHARACTER SHE WAS IN THE PREVIOUS NOVELS. MAYBE WE WERE ASKING TOO MUCH OF REBECCA WELLS TO GIVE US MORE AFTER SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I FELT THIS WAS A BOOK WRITTEN TO MEET A PUBLISHERS DEMAND AND NOT ONE FROM THE HEART LIKE THE FIRST TWO. WAIT UNTIL THE PAPERBACK COMES OUT TO BUY IT."
3,My two cents...,I've read all the reader reviews and agree: this was definitely the worst of the three novels. I guess it is hard to replicate a success. I thought the first half of the book wasn't that awful but I became rapidly bored during the last part. The kidnapping episode seemed totally out of place with the rest of the story and the last few chapters were filled with dozens of new names and characters who were uninteresting and had never been mentioned before.I think the author should have stayed with the four adult YaYas and perhaps their immediate children instead of straying all over the place.
1,Big Let Down,"I actually couldn't even finish this book, it just started to become torture every time I looked at it! And I was moved so much by the ya yas. I felt that these were the imperfect parents no one told you about in books, this book seemed to forget all that and make up new characters to replace the ones I really loved!"
2,Ya-Ya Leftovers,"I very much enjoyed the first two Ya-Ya books, so picked this one up expecting more enjoyable reading.Unfortunately, it's only suitable for Ya-Ya fans who must have more stories of the Walker clan. This book amounts to nothing but left-overs. It appears to be charater sketches that were discarded for use in the first two books. Like the other books it's a collection of vignettes; but this book is more hodge-podge than its predecessors - and doesn't seem to have common plot. The third time Ya-Yas book seems boring; and has way too many characters; - you need the family tree on the book's cover to keep up with the story."
1,GARBAGE!,A real waste of my time and money...don't bother with this grade F movie...why not watch Harry and the Hendersons instead!
5,Interesting documentary for bigfoot enthusiasts,"This documentary has a reality spin to it, and centers around ""The Frazier Land"" and ""Panther Rock"" of Kentucky. Wasn't impressed by the music and computer generated sequences, but this film is interesting in much of the content, which seems credible for the most part."
3,Entertaining,"Admittedly I don't know a whole about these mythical beings known as Sasquatch and Big Foot and I am skeptical about their existence. This film did little to alter my opinion as there wasn't any legitimate scientific evidence presented. It was however highly entertaining in the way that these folk stories are intended to be. I can't say whether or not these types of creatures actually exist although I think with all of our modern technology we would likely have some visual proof but the film did bring up some interesting and though-provoking points about their existence. All in all though, the film was more entertaining than educational - especially the ""Blair Witch"" scenes. Watch it with an open mind and you will enjoy it."
4,"Bigfoot, Fact or Fiction??","Informative and entertaining film about Bigfoot, fact or fiction? Philip Spencer was not even a believer when he started this film. I love out of the norm information and this was chalk full of it. I am not sure if I am a believer now but I definitely would not rule out the existence."
3,The Weakest Link,"The Dr. Brain series has always prided itself on challenging puzzles that help children learn, while having fun at the same time. This game, however, has unexciting puzzles that are not only far too easy, but also extremely mundane. With the exception of the the primordial soup puzzle, which is relatively simple, but fun, the game's puzzles are extremely repetitive. By the end, the game is hardly a challenge at all, but I doubt most people will have the patience to play the whole way through anyway."
4,Love the ABC puzzle,"My ABC puzzle came in-tact with all the letters....and I will be giving it to my son for his birthday. I love that the letters are cut out to make matching simpler. My son, who is turning two, will love it!"
1,Ordered 2 of these...both defective! 2 letter M and no W!,Do not buy! Defective! I ordered 2 of these on different dates and they are defective. 2 letter m and no w! Returning both!
1,WHAT HAPPENED???,"A Sudden Change of Heart is the newest title of a novel written by Barbara Taylor Bradford. In the past I have really enjoyed some of her books like Her Own Rules and Act of Will and also disliked some of her titles like Angel and Dangerous to Know. And I am one of the few people who could never get into A Woman of Substance (Bradford's blockbuster saga which has two other books in the series and was also made into a mini-series). Well, I'm afraid that her newest book is one which I can't wait to finish. Unfortunately, this time around, Bradford brought much too much to her writing table, so there are too many plot lines that are underdeveloped as well as characters. If you've ever read Bradford and enjoyed her- skip this one."
5,BARBARA AT HER BEST!!!,"Imagine a book that you just can't stop reading.Did it? If the book is not A SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART, you are wrong! I'm quite sure it's Barbara's at her best! She never wrote such a book before! I just hope that she'll keep that good work coming. The more she can, because this is the kind of book it's worth reading. You just can't put it down! Barbara Taylor Bradford is a"
3,A Change of Heart,"I bought this book before I took a lengthy flight back to the coast; i did so because it was toted a New York Times bestseller, and it looked amusing. I must say that I have never read a book with such jumpy plot lines, forced dialogue and unbelievable characters. The author is imaginative, yet there is definitely a lack of consistancy in the storyline. Doug, Laura's husband goes through a radicl change in the middle of the novel which is highly unexpected. Laura's conversations with other characters are forced and broken up. It's like the author has an agenda on what she wants her characters to get out in dialoge, they don't so she (having no control)tries to just slip information in. Her story would be great if it weren't for these nagging faults. The way she sets up the story is just slightly lacking."
1,"She can't be that talentless, and still so popular? I guess she can...","""Power of a Woman"" was an awful novel, but since Bradford is so popular, I figured that one must have been an exception. It wasn't. ""A Sudden Change of Heart"" isn't much better. There's hardly any plot to be found (the story that's described on the back of the book takes place only in the last half of the novel). Instead it's filled with endless superficial dialog and descriptions of paintings and furniture. Like with ""Power of a Woman"", with this book Bradford shows neither talent or inspiration. It's a boring novel full of clichés. My advice is, find something else to read and don't give your money to Barbara Taylor Bradford."
1,Don't recommend the Abridged Audio,"While the actress did a fine job, the editing of this story in the abridged audio version of this book was terrible.Major events and twists came on abruptly, yet other scene's were left in that had little to do with the story. And I was supposed to cheer for two characters who fell in love ""off-page""? At least give me something more to work with.As it was, the writing, especially the dialogue, was overwraught and stilted. Who says to someone ""Come sit in the chair opposite me""? Somehow, stage direction became confused with conversation.Perhaps if I'd listened to the unabridged version of this story, I'd have fewer complaints. But the abridged copy is probably only for those who REALLY want to know what happens in this book, but don't need more than a synopsis."
1,For This They Kill Trees?,"She just can't do it anymore. She had one decent book back in the 70s, and her whole career has been one anticlimax after another since then. The characters here are one-dimensional and interchangeable: so much so that when I picked the book back up after going for a short walk, I'd forgotten who the main character was! The big question is, Why do they keep putting out her stuff? Even her biggest fans seem to have moved on. I know I have."
1,Couldn't get past page 25!,"The book is simply poorly written. It lacks literary creativity and after reading many cliche phrases such as ""it was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop,"" after only reaching page 25, I wondered if this author has ever grasped for new and original lines of thinking.Also, there is a early ""secret"" concerning Claire that is discovered by Megan in the first section titled ""1972,"" that is so predictable that it makes me believe that either the author wanted us to figure this out or that she takes us all for complete imbeciles."
1,A Sudden Change of Heart,"It is sad when an author gets a multi-million dollar book contract, and manages to create a book that obviously written to meet a deadline. There are a few tricks to make a short story into a novel and it is very apparent that the author needed to use most of them. How many time's do the characters 1st & last names need to appear? If this were a Mario Puzo novel it would be acceptable, but there are only a few characters in this book. Also, do we really need the characters history repeated everytime we are reintroduced to that said character. This is a really poorly written book and I am really sorry I ever wasted my time reading it. You would be better off picking up Danielle Steele's lastest."
2,Just not believable!,"I've enjoyed Barbara Taylor Bradford's work in the past, A Sudden Change of Heart does not live up to Barbara's reputation. The characters are very weak, and not convincing. She spent way to much time elaborating on things that really didn't enrich the story. Although she did delve into a lot of controversial topics, the characters just didn't carry the story well. The ending was so far fetched, I couldn't even talk myself into believing it. The story reads like a really bad Danielle Stelle novel, I was not impressed."
2,I was very disappointed with this book.,"This book does not capture the usual style of Barbara Taylor Bradford. Though the main characters were developed well, the dialogue was always too ""plastic"" and unreal. People do not talk to one another in that fashion! The plot was also not very well developed."
2,Sadly Disappointed....,"As a die hard fan of BTB, I was so looking forward to this book coming out. Tracking it thru a variety of sources I finally ordered it before availability date through Amazon. When it arrived, I settled in with a cup of tea, fuzzy blanket and snuggling kitties. Bummer - unlike her previous novels, this one was ""air popped"". Usually filled with sharp images of color, atmosphere, emotion, china/silver, places and characters who are friends, it was like a TV movie version of a delicious book - watered down, too many blank spaces in imagery and complacent characters (except for Megan!). Also,I stumbled on dialog that had contemporary American women in their early 30's calling each other ""dear"". Sorry - didn't ring true. Boohoo; I'm so disappointed! Next BTB book? - I'll wait for other readers reviews or until it's available at the library."
1,What a disappointment!,"As a formerly ardent fan of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books I was tremendously disappointed with her latest, A Sudden Change of Heart. I read the rambling, waiting for a plot to develop, but never found it. Several times I thought a story line was developing only to be disappointed. This book was definitely not up to the standard we've come to expect from Ms. Bradford. Too bad. Her early works were delightful."
4,Made me Cry,"I've read most of BTB's books. When I'm done with them, I donate them or sell them. But to me ""A Sudden Change of Heart"" was one of her best and I'm keeping it.Even though I agree with some of the other readers, that the ""language"" the characters spoke was a bit antiquated and formal, I really enjoyed the book.I was at a doctor's appointment today, and I started to tear while I was reading what happened to Claire. I had to stop for awhile.The friendship between Laura and Claire is very much alike to my best friend and me. We've known each other since we're 5 & 6 - and we'll be celebrating our 30th anniversary next year - so this kind of friendship does exist.Don't be afraid to buy this book. Try it, you may like it!"
1,Certainly not Bradford at her best ...,"I wondered as I read this if Ms. Bradford had written this novel much earlier on, and was able to publish it now after she has reached success with other books. This one is so shallow, so jerky, and so filled with characters who are so wooden that I can't believe Ms. Bradford, who is ordinarily a talented writer of engrossing women's contemporary novels, actually wrote this. What happened?"
2,The main character is nice but boring...,"The book did not draw me into this main character. I almost stopped reading the book twice, but gritted it out. Simply put, the supporting characters are more interesting than the main, and that's not saying much."
4,Classic Barbara Taylor Bradford,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I have been reading this author since A Woman of Substance and have never been disappointed with a book. Just one small criticism - I found the ending very abrupt, perhaps I am just too used to happy ever after stories"
4,Stallone...Nuff Said!,He's a total badass and hes good in all the movies he has does...I would recommend to anyone and everyone
3,Lock Up,This movie was ok.I thought it would be a little more exciting. This is a early Stallone movie.Dont get me wrong it has action in it.The story could have been written a little better.
1,Pointless boring film!,Huge Stallone fan here. This movie failed to capture my attention at all on any level. Had to really force myself to sit through it. Happy when most of these stupid characters got killed. Especially the one with thenbig mouth that kept getting Stallone beat up. No wonder this flopped when it came out. It sucked.
3,A afthers Favorite,My Dad loved Stallone and This was for him. Great chemistry between Stallone and Sutherland. Sutherland plays the role of Drumgold so well you really hate him! It is one of his BEst Performances!
3,For Sly Fans Only,"Okay, not a great movie... but if you like Stallone, it's worth checking out. Without Stallone, this thing probably wouldn't have made it to the theaters; it has the feel of a straight-to-cable flick. Definitely not a classic prison escape movie.Actually, Tom Sizemore is worth seeing here too, if you're a fan of his. He has some nice moments as the deceptively helpful inmate that befriends Stallone.The DVD is pretty inexpensive, but does include a couple modest special features. Usually, these low-priced DVDs are 'movie only' editions, but ""Lock Up"" has two short featurettes. One is a 7 minute 'making of' promo, and the other-- not listed on the case-- is entitled ""Sylvester Stallone"" and is a 3 minute piece featuring more interview clips with Stallone. Pretty cool that the DVD producers added that. Also included is the theatrical trailer and decent cast/crew/production notes."
5,Derek from Johannesburg,"BEST PRISON DRAMA MOVIEAfter Rocky 1, this is Stallone's BEST movie! (the reason why this is in my DVD collection)..Anyone that can say that the Shawshank Redemption was a better prison drama, obviously wasn't watching this movie.The movie shows the tough side and the human side to a man trying to make the best of a bad situation (in prison).Stallone's brilliant performance highlights both these qualities.There'll never be another Sylvester Stallone - only modern-day imitations.."
2,Average samples from a great artist,"Im sorry and sad to say that this cd is not a great sample cd and is not an essential tool in your library. most of the samples seem to be leftovers from music tracks from fatboys 80s collection or soomething like that. The only good thing in this cd is that it gives you the right to use ""the rockafeller skank's"" drumsit began in afrika, phrase from chemical brothersmusic makes you loos control, from les rythmes digitalesand a couple of other popular phrasesthe only drawback is that they are already famous and a remix would only be a remix, not an original...i suggest you spend your money on a computer music magazine which has better and more samples"
5,Satisfied customer,"CD is in good shape, and looks new. I haven't listened to it yet, but I was more concerned whether it was in good shape or not, and it looks like that was not a problem."
1,Boring,'Dust in the wind' is an excellent song. Everything else on this album is too abstract or too boring.The only people who'd appreciate this album are die hard Kansas fans or people who like progressive rock from the 70's.I bought the album for 'Dust in the wind' thinking they may have other catchy tracks. I should've looked around for a compilation featuring that track instead.
2,No return indeed....,"Altough all the musicians are really gifted, the sound here is so thin, polished, outdates, that I think these great songs deserved a ""re-recorded"" album.I had heard great thing about these albums and, before buying it, all I had from Kansas was a live compilation from 1986 (King Biscuit Flower Hour), that I bought due to Steve Morse being in the band at that time, not for Kansas! The sound there is much more heavy and crispy and tight than the original versions (maybe it's just the difference from 1977 to 1986).So, I surely am dissapointed with POINTO OF KNOW RETURN (and what a silly joke this title!)"
4,Classical good,"Kansas is awesome. Today they are a bit dated but they could really rock when this was released. lyrical and melodic right into violin racing, tempo rushing syncopation. Not to mention the musical time changes that turn the beat around constantly. Oh yeah, this album has the classic ""Dust in the wind"".Buy it, it is good and an older generation will respect you for it- wait forget them. buy it and don't let the elders know you like it."
5,Remastered sound doesn't rip your head off any more,"I used to test speaker prototypes with the original pressing of this CD. Some idiot must have used master tapes equalized for making LP records. If the speaker had a peak in the mid or high frequencies, man oh man you would hear it! ow!Thankfully, this remastering sounds much smoother and more listenable. However, offhand I don't find the mix quality is improved, so if you don't feel the album sounds too full of treble (maybe you listen on a boom box or whatever), don't bother."
4,"Good, Solid Bag, But...","This is a good, solid bag, but not without faults. It's stylish to take anywhere and you can fit quite an amount in it (I regularly fit a hardcover book, thermose, lunch for work, plus PSP, keys and cell phone). The drawback I have is the adjuster strap never stays in place, but it doesn't slip too much. My main gripe is that I must question the ""water resistant"" material. The contents I had in the bag after walking in a rain shower (WITH an umbrella) were fairly wet; though not ruined. A good, solid bag, none-the-less."
5,GREAT BAG,THIS BAG IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE. IT HAS PLENTY OF ROOM AND LOTS OF COMPARTMENTS. YOU WON'T GO WRONG BY BUYING THIS BAG.
5,Awesome bag,I bought this bag after reading the reviews and I'm not disappointed! It is very roomy but not bulky. I find it comfortable to wear. I also have no problem fitting a standard water bottle or soda in the side pouch! It's a great purchase!
4,great for light items & as purse replacement,"I bought this bag to use on a trip to DC back in March. I love the color (I got the dark purple) and it has great pockets (the cell phone pocket on the front of the strap is especially handy). On days when I wear it to work it holds my ipad, my Pouchee purse organizer, my snack, my phone, train pass/schedules, my calendar and my car keys. It certainly can hold a lot of stuff, but I prefer lighter items simply because when I wear it for long periods (like all day around DC) the heavy items aren't comfortable with only the one strap. On short trips (to and from work) heaviy items cause no problem. My only complaint is that the straps are just a little too long- I have them as tight as possible but it would be really helpful if the bag just sat another inch or two higher on my back... I'm 5'4"". I may take it to my taylor to see if they can shorten the strap just a little. But, it's a great bag, and I can't wait to take it to Disney this summer :o)"
5,I love it!,"I had coveted this bag for quite a while and when I finally got it I discovered that it was everything I had imagined! It holds everything I need, very convenient pockets."
5,bag,love it use it everyday. i have people asking me where i got it and asking about the different colors.
