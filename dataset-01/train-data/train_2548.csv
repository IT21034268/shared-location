5,Top Quality Lens,"There is no noticable fall off on the edges as I had on my similar Sigma lens. This lens is more costly, heavier but worth the extra cost and weight. The price here was several hundred dollars less that at other vendors."
5,The ulta wide to own,I use this lens on a 5D Mk II and I have had none of the clarity issues that some reviewers have complained about beyond 20mm. Excellent image quality in all ranges and I enjoy the flexibility that a ultra wide prime lens doesn't.
2,Canon Lens,"Was disappointed with this lens. Its ok but it didn't provide a big enough difference with a 2.8 for using in low light. I'm looking for something to use in low light and not have to use a flash at times. I compared against my 28-135 3.5-5.6 and 18-55 3.5-5.6, it just didn't make enough difference so I don' t feel the lens is worth the cost for that reason."
3,Disappointed,"Maybe, I'm just used to the clarity of my sub 2.0 aperture lenses. I'm not a professional by far, but I do notice a difference in quality/sharpness even when I set my 50mm 1.4 and 85mm 1.2 to 2.8. Don't get me wrong, its not a terrible lens, its just that I expected more for over 1K.I only have an EF-S wide-angle lens to compare to, and its obviously worse. Perhaps its unfair to judge between a fixed and a wide-angle lens?"
5,"Perfect service, quality product.",I had no issues with this seller. The product was packaged extremely well and was shipped in a timely manner. Tracking information was provided. Will do business with this company again in the future.
5,Best Canon Wide Angle Zoom you can get...,"When compared to it's little brother, the 17-40mm f/4L, this thing is a beast! Even on a 1.6x sensor (7D) camera you get an astounding perspective. I can pretty much stand at the corner of a room and more than 80% of it in view. Great for indoor shots because you don't have to stand back to get the shot. And the wide 2.8 aperture is definitely more forgiving than the 4 provided by the 17-40mm, especially in low light conditions. If you have the money to spend, save yourself the hassle of having wide angle envy and buy this instead of the 17-40mm, although while a great lens in it of itself, pales to this. Also, for those who say this a heavy lens, it's a feather compared to the 24-70mm f/2.8L or 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II. Mounted on a semi-pro body, it's a joy to shoot with."
4,beautiful hymns,B.R. Hearn. wonderful music glorifying God. too bad some songs have just an excerpt of a chorus--no stanzas. otherwise i would have given it five stars.
1,ALL OF THEM,"I wish I could write about it IF I HAD A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO IT. HOW ON EARTH DO YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO BUY YOUR CD'S WHEN ONE CANNOT LISTEN TO IT ON LINE. IF ONE CAN, IT MUST BE SO WELL HIDDEN THAT IT WILL TAKE AN EXPERT TO FIGURE IT OUT. RIDICULOUS. THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY."
5,Highly Recommended,Author Michael E. Bemis did an excellent job on making the characters come to life. I can relate to so many characters in this book since I also worked at a local ski resort. I recommeded this book to all of my skiing friends and family.
4,a good read,"i am a life long skier, many yrs in new england all over N.H. MAINE sunday river, sugarloaf, parts of the A.T. i have also worked in the industry as a lifty, snowmaker, and now as a patroller for several yrs.Snowaste is a good read at times its a great read!! the author has done his homework which is good because it really helps u do feel like u r skiing at times, makin snow at 10pm. etc so if u r looking for a entertaining read about a industry that get more technical season read SNOW WASTE!!"
2,good premise but boring and weak,"I was really disappointed in this book. I do believe that many books on entrepreneurship are meant to be inspirational and therefore end up being unrealistic, and to be fair, I do think this book paints a more practical and accurate picture. With that said, the book was very general, lacked interesting and relevant examples, and didn't add much value. Furthermore, the book seems to be 200 pages but about 70 pages are a worthless list of universities.The worst thing? The authors repeatedly present italicized quotes of themselves, attempting to make their own thoughts and backgrounds seem even more important than they are. Disappointing."
3,Great book . . . but smells horrible,"Our son loves this book, but it smells horrible . . . not sure if it's from the ink or what, but I am thinking about throwing it away because I just can't stand the smell."
4,Very cute!!,"Very cute book, my daughter loves it!! The only problem I have with it is that the pages are just thick paper, so my 2 year old has already tore off 3 of the flaps. Still a very cute book. just keep the tape handy!!!"
4,my 2-year old loves this set,"I purchased this toy for my 2 year old daughter, who happens to love farm animals. She is having a lot of fun with these bath toys, and can stick them to the wall all by herself. I know that she will have a lot of fun playing with these. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because the white border around the different animal printings had some blue marks on it. My daughter doesn't notices this of course, but it made the purchase seem a little cheap. Overall, I know this is a great toy for her and has made bath time more fun."
5,Bath Time Fun,Good toy for the bath and like that it comes with a bag to store the pieces in so they aren't just left all over the tub.
2,Not a good value,"My son already had ""pirates in the tub"", which is a fantastic bath toy. I purchased this thinking it would be just as grand even though I expected it to be a smaller set. I was dissapointed to find that it only was an assorted of 12 pieces! I paid $10 for this toy. That comes out to almost $1 per piece. Not worth it! Pay the extra money and get the pirates, which is a 38 piece assortment and includes squirters."
4,my son loves these,"My son is really into animals and enjoys creating farm scenes in the tub with these simple foam shapes. They seem pretty durable, though he has only had them a few months. No mildewing or deterioration. And the hanging bag it comes with is pretty handy, too."
5,Bath time fun!,This is my 14 month old most favorite toy! She would spend hours putting them up and taking them down during bath time. After bath time she is still completely entertained by putting these farm friends up on the mirror. Also uses them as teething soothers. By far my daughters favorite!
4,Great tub fun,"My 2 year old really loves his reusable bath stickers. They stick on our tub really well. I would like the colors to be a bit more realist, but he doesn't care. Has made bath time easier. 12 stickers included."
2,Foam tub farm,Not as colorful as I thought it would be and too many farm pieces and not enough animals. Grandson doesn't use much.
2,"Buggy Software, Period.","I agree firmly with the negative reviews of Broderbund. They produce buggy software, they do not support their products at any level of decent detail, they 'abandon' their products just after a couple years. I have tried several Broderbund products over the years and their software is just plain buggy and untested. This was the straw. No more 'broderbund' @#$%-ware."
2,print shop 15 deluxe,I was diappointed to find no instuctions to use last two dic. so no why to use them no help listed on prutuce
1,Print Shop 15 Delima,"It took me 4 hours to try and install this program. It would get as far as ""updating files"" and freeze right there on the spot. No instruction booklet came with the software so basicly your on your own. Also, there was no indication that you had to uninstall the pervious version before attempting Print Shop 15.Finally I had to e-mail Broderbund for help and they referred me to their Techincal web site to sort out the answer for myself.Very dissapointed!!! I myself do not see very many new graphics, there the same as Print Shop 12. So whats so great about Print Shop 15? I don't know!!"
1,Installation Nightmare for Nothing New,It wouldn't install on my Dell. Maybe Broderbond doesn't think Dells are catching on as a home computer. I was able to get it going on my HP at work and found it to be about the same as the version I already have (version 12). The box says it now does PDFs. I can get that free on the web. I was hoping it would do more cards and things I actually do.Skip it if you already have version 12.
1,Mr. Alex,It really wasn't that great. You could do all this stuff with other programs. Not only that you could get all the fonts and pictures online for free. I just don't see what you are paying for.Trust me it[s not very good.]
1,Save your money,"I was almost ready to buy Serif 9, but in an apparent moment of weakness, decided that my relatively simple project would be something Print Shop Deluxe 15 could handle... For starters, there's no way to change the default 1/2 page print margin! Help is an exercise in futility--no manual, and the on-line help is worthless due to lack of useful indexing. Lot's of bugs (try changing the font size while scrolling text in a text box window). Fails 50% of the time. The only way to recover is to cut and paste to some other word processing application, and then paste it back. This works 100% of the time. BUG! The PDF generator is useless (changes colors grossly and also misaligns the work on the page. Gave up trying to talk with Tech Support after 35 minutes of bad music. Save yourself the aggravation on buy something else."
1,Most unreliable SW I've used. Should rate 0 stars.,"We started with Printshop 11. We tried upgrading to 12 in the hopes it would fix some bugs and add features. It added features, but also added tons of bugs. Customer support knows nothing about the program either and has been useless. This doesn't work as advertised, doesn't print what shows on the screen, crashes very frequently, doesn't handle large projects (like calendars with lots of pictures), etc."
4,"Missing Feature To Do ""BORDERS*","Having used Print Shop since Version 3 was out, I am very pleased for the most part with their software. Believe I get plenty of 'bang' for a small buck. Made weird discovery just tonight -- I cannot locate the ""borders"" function. The icon on the left toolbar should read frames and borders. I only have 'frames'. Have email support to see what's up. Have a feeling that it is due to Win XP and one or both of the service packs I've installed. If anyone has had this problem and solved it would enjoy an email. Thanks. Patsy926@comcast.net"
1,Broderbund Print Shop Delux 15,"Having used previous versions of this software, I was disappointed and frustrated by this program. The lack of a manual is a major headache, as searching the help function is like looking for a light switch in the dark. The inability to access and use graphics I've used from previous PS versions is just unbelievable. I've also found numerous bugs in the program, such as the fact that some of the the Avery label templates actually don't work, believe it or not, even when applied directly to the prepackaged PS 15 label projects. The labels print progressively lower until they're off the page at the bottom. I called Broderbund several times, and after 30 minutes on hold each time, they attempted to use the same templates and encountered the same glitch. I got no help, even when the Product Manager was called in. For some graphics projects, I've actually found it more productive to use the MS Word table function with Avery labels - a sad commentary."
1,No satisfaction with this product from Broderbund!,I purchased this because I enjoyed Print Shop 12. Most of the graphics for Version 15 are on line not on the CD. Graphics I used to get from 12 were no longer on the CD but on line. You have to download the images to your hard drive. Many of the advertised additional graphics are cheap photos or ugly clip art images. Version 15 also uninstalled version 12 and my disks would no longer install it when I removed Version 15 in disgust. Broderbund offered no help with this and never responded to a written complaint filed with the Better Business Bureau. The amount it would have cost them: 10 dollars to send me replacement disks to reinstall Print Shop 12. What a terrible way to treat a customer!!!
4,Great for renters!,"Depending on the crappy water situation in your town, these work great! The worse the water, the more often you'll have to change them! I was changing them about ever 2-3 months, but our water is HORRIBLE!"
5,Best portable Water Filter For Shower,Don't take my word for it. Buy it and you will see and feel the difference the 1st timePlease see my full detailed comments under shower head.
4,pretty good,"For the most part, I am enjoying this book. The diet is based on the food pyramid, and the exercise program has do-able daily choices. My only complaints are the following: First, the page quality is very poor. I felt like I had to be really careful turning the pages or they would tear. Second, some of the exercise photos show very poor form, like knees extending past ankles is lunges. All in all, it's a good book."
5,More than I expected!,I love this CD. I don't know much about this group but I intend to find out more.The real treat though is the DVD disc with the live performances. I just can't get over how enjoyable the live performances are. You can tell that this band loves to play and takes their audience along for the ride.Very much worth the price!
3,"The Sextant Handbook, by Bruce Bauer","Bauer -- no, not Jack Bauer, and Bruce isn't his brother -- is an ex-Navy man and often it comes through his writing, which sets the books mood and tone. If you've battled with self-learning celestial navigation (as I am) you'll appreciate the beginnings of the book, and it IS more readable and understandable than much of what I've been through before. The second edition is dated 1992; the pricing he gets into on used sextants is worthless; his seemingly complete disdain for plastic sextants (I have a Davis Mk. 25) is pretty clear as well. Nonetheless, this is pretty clearly written, and in many cases explained theory/math that I was unable to grasp in other instructional books. I've still yet to make a correct sight, but I'm getting closer all the time!"
1,How to read signts--Nowhere in the handbook,"The most important use of a handbook is to tell you how to read sights taken by the sextant. That, you cannot find here; thus the 1 star.To be fair, there are 2 attempts at this, but by way of captions to figures or drawings. The first is Fig. 2-3 at page 41. The supposed reading is 29* 42'.5. The 29* is easily shown by the arrow pointed to the scales in the arc; and so is the 42"" indicated in the micrometer drum. But how can you tell .5 minutes from the vernier?The second is Fig. 7-4 at page 129 that demonstrates index error corrections for ""on the arc"" and ""off the arc"" index errors. Again, the ""minutes"" portion of the readings are easy, but that for fraction of ""minutes"" is pure guess work.The handbook should have devoted an entire section to correct reading of the sextant."
4,Great toy overall.,"This is a great toy overall. Some of the questions in this review don't really apply to my use of the toy. It's more of a collectible item, gift for a friend. It is exactly what I wanted and satisfies my purchase experience."
1,not impressed,"I have other works in the traveller series. They are much more diverse in sound. Although I like a bit of the ""India"" sound, I felt this disc was way to heavy with it. Maybe it's just me, but the lack of any real danceable beats is disappointing. I found it to be to repetative. Sorry, but I am really not happy with this work.To me traveller 01 is what the series should be about."
5,What could be more important?,This book offers easy to follow advice on how to keep our kids ALIVE behind the wheel. Today's teens have more distractions than ever while driving. And they think they're invincible. We grown ups know better. I loved the examples and descriptions. Really useful information. Your kids should read this the month BEFORE they get their permits.
1,Looks nice but defective product!,I ordered four of these ( 35 lb vittles vault plus w paw prints )and received four defective. Either the collar around the neck where you screw on the lid is broken or when you screw off the lid the top edge is split open or both. I returned for replacement all four and when I got the new batch all four of those were defective in the same manner. Don't bother with this product as this high defect rate even if you get a good one demonstrates that it will simply not hold up to weather conditions and will split on the top edge for certain. Was a waste of time and money for both me and amazon. This is not a condemnation of all vittles vault models just this particular model needs work.[...]
5,awesome rock and roll,This is one of the best cd's I have heard in years. The singer was meant to be a rock and roll singer and the guitar riffs only add to the music and not screw it up. It's just good ol' rock and roll and I love it. Thanks Acroma.
4,Good music comes from anywhere,These guys really rock on this cd. The cd is pretty versatile. ACROMA is able to express feelings in an upbeat attitude leaving the listener ready to rock out with friends. And the singer's voice is so fresh and new.
3,klein 58889 padded strap,"The strap is a good replacement for my needs which was for my golf bag. I would like it much better if the length could adjust a little more, its some what limited. padding on the strap not the best but it serves the purpose. over all i'm satisfied with the purchase."
2,Ugly,"This is an industrial strength shoulder strap -- probably great for it's intended use, carrying a tool bag. But you wouldn't want to use it on any brief case or luggage unless you really don't care how it looks -- returned."
4,Strong,"Made in the USA was a big plus. The pad is very comfortable, the only thing missing is a swivel on each of the hooks. However the pad is double sided so you just twist the strap and all is good."
2,great quality but,"I picked this up for a broken strap on my laptop bag.I like the padded portion but the strap is too bulky.It would be better if the connectors could swivel, but they don't so it makes it a little too awkward to use.Had to get a different one after about two months."
4,Very sturdy and comfortable.,"I bought these for my elementary school kids to attach to their orchestra instruments so they could carry them more comfortably to the bus stop. They are very well-made and are working perfectly. The only thing that could have improved them for my purpose would be to make the strap able to be adjusted just a bit shorter. Should be no issue for an older child or adult, however."
5,Fabulous Replacement for Computer Bag,"I bought this strap as a replacement for my MacBook computer bag after the original strap broke. It's a very sturdy, well-made strap (better than the original), and it's comfortable on my shoulder. Great price, too."
4,Delivered as advertised,Very comfortable padded adjustable shoulder strap. The clips and hardware are metal and don't feel cheap. Five stars would have been attained if the metal clips had swivels.
4,reference,Same review for issue 34 and 35. They provide a very detailed overview on older comics and their pricing. The only problem is finding anyone that you can trust and someone who will give you anywhere near that price
5,Excellant Study Guide for the Family Practice Boards,"I used this book as a central guide for study for the 2000 Boards in Family Practice. Unlike typical board review texts using the multiple choice format, this book uses short questions followed by brief answers and review. It made study fun."
1,Not impressed,"A lot of misspelled words, and terrible grammar. The story jumped around too much. I do not feel it was worth the money."
3,Not what I expected.,"The usual magic Lurlene McDaniel puts in her books was missing from this book. However, the characters and plot are very real life."
1,Not her best,I bought this book having been a fan of McDaniel in her past works. But with this novelette she definitely dropped the ball.First off it is very short. Something that a normal speed reader could finish in an hour.The plot is not only predictable it is dull and rather unmemorable.I ended up giving my copy away to my much younger cousin.I'd say if you are buying it for someone under the age of 11 then it would be okay. Anyone older than that may find it insulting
3,Not one of McDaniels best.,"She seems to stray away from the topics of her other books. If you read L. mcDaniels Books for the drama of them, dont pick up this one"
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"I ORDERED THESE TO USE WITH MY JUMP BOOTS. THE EYELETS DO NOT LINE UP AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE THEM WORK, IN ADDITION THESE PEOPLE CHARGE A FLAT RATE OF 4.00 EXCHANGE FEE FOR ANYTHING UNDER 1LB.AND AN ADDITIONAL RESTOCKING FEE OF 15%. THE ZIPPERS COST 9.30, SO IF THEY WERE RETURNED, IN A MONTH OR SO I WOULD GET A REFUND OF 3.90. ALSO, THEY ARE NOT LEATHER, THEY ARE VINYL. I WIL NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. THE ONLY POSITIVE IS THAT THEY ARRIVED WHEN PROMISED. LOT OF GOOD THAT DID. PEACE."
5,Fantastic Rust Removal off Sidings,"This product is simply great. The chimney cap of our wood-burning fireplace got rusty and left a horrific streak of rust stain from the roof top, all the way down to the ground. The stain was deep brown in color and spread out as wide as the width of the chimney. Ours is a two story house with vinyl sidings. I've tried almost all sorts of cleaners for sidings to no avail, until I read about this product. Expedient delivery. The product worked like wonder, taking the stubborn stain off almost immediately without much physical effort! Amazing! Strongly recommended for anyone dealing with the rust problems on vinyl sidings. This product rocks!"
1,William Barr GSX00101 Gallon Rust Stain Remover,"Got it for rust stains on our new concrete driveway. Did not work, no difference."
3,"Strange brew, but good for someone who already knows syntax","This book is hacked together from other publications and it shows. Writing styles vary, and some surprisingly important things just don't get done -- for example, there is no unified discussion of the language syntax. However, especially in later sections of the book, the examples are great and the writing is good. And, yes, it is 1000 pages for less than most other such books."
2,Java 2 Complete,"This book is extracted from several sybex Java books. If you read the review of these books (Mastering Java 2, Mastering JavaBeans, Java 2: In Record Time, and Java 2 Developer's Handbook), you will know that it is not a good Java book.Writing styles vary and each section is not connected with the others. If you are a beginner, save your money and look for others."
2,"Big, thick, cheap, but not a value","I purchased this book several years ago when I was learning Java. I returned home from the bookstore and proceeded to read, and work, through the book. Granted, there is a lot here. Unfortunately, many of the examples were inaccurate (would not compile), the organization seemed faulty (not enough explanation of what was being accomplished until later, and even then it was often sketchy), and the underlying theory was nearly non-existent. Move ahead five years and there is the added detriment that Java has changed over the years and releases. There are deprecated classes and methods, innovations in thinking, and additional tools for development. As much (or little) usefulness this book had when published has been eroded with the passage of time. If you are looking for a reference, Sun has excellent documentation online. If you are looking for a tutorial, there are better books as well as excellent online tutorials."
1,You get what you pay for...,"As another reviewer stated, this book is a compilation of pieces of other Sybex books. The books is a bit disjointed in the flow of ideas. If all you want to do is create a few small applets for a web page, then this is probably a satisfactory book. However, if you're serious about starting Java programming, look elsewhere. The value of this book for the serious student is nill, as is the reference value. For reference, you can't go wrong with any of the O-Reilly books, but I wouldn't look to O-Reilly if you're just starting out."
2,Does not deliver,As far as actually teaching you how to program in java i think that this book fails. The programming that it shows you is only very basic and you are never show how to develop it better or farther. It would be a decent reference book since most of the API is in the appendix of the book. Mostly i just felt as though it was an advertisement for more of sybex's books since all they did was take chapters from 4 of their other books.
3,Not all I had hoped,"Want a big, beautiful jumbo guitar for not a whole lot of money? Want a quality fit and finish that rivals much more expensive instruments? Want a strong neck that feels just like that Gibson neck we all know and love? You could do much worse than the EJ-200. I am 100% satisfied with those aspects of the guitar.However...If you are hoping for the warm, deep, make your own mother cry volume and tone that you would get from the (ten times) more expensive Gibson J-200, then this is not your guitar. Play the two one after the other, and then you'll hear why the Gibson costs more than a used Hyundai and the Epiphone costs less than taking a family of four to an NFL game.Still, I like the guitar. No plans to trade or sell it. And swapping the original strings for a set of Elixers or Dean Markley Blue Steels helps with the lower tones a bit. Just don't expect to rattle any windows."
4,The Weird and Wonderful World of Invention,"This is an interesting and unique look into the world of invention. The book is basically a number of items for which people have acquired patents from the ridiculous to the...well, ridiculous. Each invention is illustrated with a description of what the item does as well as the number and year of the patent. Not exactly on par with Edison or Franklin, this book includes patents for such things as eye protectors for chickens, a self-saluting hat (for which no hands are required), a device for producing dimples and even a hollow cow to be used by hunters to get closer to their prey. This is a fascinating piece on discovery and the drive to make a buck by any means necessary. The only reason it doesn't get a fifth star is due to the fact that with only one or two products displayed per page, the book reads a little too quickly. I wish it were twice as long."
3,good pointer but...,"The laser pointer worked very well, however, the cap that keeps it attached to your key chain is not very well made. The pointer easily fell off my key chain and now it is lost. It was a good idea but I think they need to think of a better way of keeping it attached."
5,Excellent Research,"Beyond the outstanding and absolutely timeless photography in this book, IN THE CAL offers unique and thoughtful information on the transformation of minor league baseball during the 1990s from a casual existence to a big-business adjunct of major league baseball. A must for any historical research on the minors..."
3,A Good Help,The typing program includes simple but progressive lessons that can be accomplished at your own pace giving you freedom to try and try again. It was easy to load to our computer and find our way around the program. The games included were a nice break from the plain lessons but kids used to video games might be disappointed with the graphics. The music included with the practice lessons is relaxing and not monotonous. My husband uses it and my teenager both hoping to increase their speed and accuracy (and for a little down time in front of the computer screen). Overall a helpful product.
4,Very helpful workbook without risk of falling asleep!!,"After reading the reviews, I bought the book and am happy I did. It's reasonably priced and helpful to those who want to advance their typing speed. There are enough exercises to keep you entertained. I've only used the textbook, but cant wait to start using the CD. Thank you for your reviews... I probably would not have purchased it if it wasnt for the positive reviews from previous buyers."
3,Super Reader,"Captain Dusty Ayres is The Speed Ace, and his plane the Silver Flash is the fastest flying machine going.As such, the US Armed Forces command have a job for him. The Black Invaders army has almost taken Europe, and their command 'Fire-Eyes', self-styled Emperor of the World, is heading for America next.With spies everywhere and communications jammed, General Horner needs Ayres to personally carry a defense plan message to all his commanders.He has lost contact with Agent 10, their last foreign agent alive.Dusty has a whole bunch of problems, gets captured, escapes, finds Agent 10 and escapes again with his help, and leads a riad on some Black Invader ships to top it all off."
1,Primo Viaggio Adapter bar,"I bought the primo viaggio car seat and these Primo Viaggio Adapter Bar it doesn't work for this car seat, because de adapter are to big, I don't know if this is a fabricant defect or what happened with this adapter bar."
2,Third Reich version of Iron Age Germany,"This book should not be available to children. Owen is/was Professor Emeritus at University of Alberta, but the book contains a ""Germany is the origin of all good people"" type of theory. It is fascinating for those interested in the origins of WWII or racism in general, but not recommended as history."
5,9x13 springform,"Used two of these to make a cheesecake for my son's wedding cake, everyone loved it and the pans performed superbly, I bought them for much more than the $15 advertised today."
5,Excellent descriptive novel,"I grew up near Wilkes-Barre, PA - coal mining country. I remember my mother talking about hearing the miners working under the houses when she and her friends would gather for coffee and cake - Took some getting used to for someone from Washington, DC. Every so often, there would be a cave-in & the families would wait anxiously for news. This novel was very descriptive & I learned quite a bit about how the life must have been for the Breaker Boys and the miners."
5,Excellent Historical Novel,"Hope someone reprints this. An excellent novel of life in the company-owned ""coal patches"" of PA."
2,Judo from VHS to DVD,"THIS DVD COST ME 25.95$ OF MY HARD EARNED CASH AND IT WASN'T WORTH IT!! THE DVD WAS POORLY DONE AND THE SOUND WAS TERRIBLE. 97% OF THE TIME THE FEATURE INSTRUCTOR OF THE DVD HARDLY EVER SHOWNED UP. I HATE I GOT THIS CRAPPY DVD ON THE ART OF JUDO. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE COOL CASE COVER, IT'S NOT WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE!!!"
4,Dust Collection Hose,"The product was delievered on time, and was the correct product. I will continue to purchas from this supplier. The installation was straight forward."
4,Truthful Objective Analysis,"After being quite interested in this movement for quite some time, this book proved to be truly informative and well researched. It was quite refreshing to read an unbiased, unslanted, account of these people and their beliefs. The further realization that the majority of the members of these organizations are not just crazed, uneducated, rednecks was also extremely refreshing."
5,An unusual selection of stories,"Very fine volume of short fiction by big names in comics, sci-fi and fantasy, as well as some less known authors, beautifuly illustrated by some of the greats in the craft. It's an unusual selection of stories, often crossing genres and intermingling styles.From Ian Watson's light-hearted ""The Human Chicken"" via Mick Farren's apocalyptic ""Fun in the Final days"" to RM Lammings's philosophical ""Wasp Songs"", all tastes are catered for, but my favourite is probably Neil Gaiman's ""Webs"", an unusual take on his usual dark fantasy."
4,"Oh, To have a love of her own!!","This way my first book by Griffin. I enjoyed the book, she has a nice writting style. Even though the book did not make me want to read it nonstop, it was good. I will be sure to get her other books though! Maybe the other couples in this book have a story that would be out of this world!"
5,More great music from Juliana!,"This is a great CD/DVD package that illustrates yet again that JH is the most talented and tasteful rocker out there. (A deliberately raw and sloppy mini-DVD of jams and performance clips from the ""Feel It"" tour is included and hints at what a full-length JH DVD would be like.)""Hooray for LA"" is one big hook, largely because of the bass line. The lyrics reference ""music in the bars that makes the floors shake"" and you'll want to crank this one up until it makes your own floors shake.""Social Control"" is hilarious!"
4,"CD is great, the dvd is a fan only purchase.",This collection of songs from the Some Girls is great. All well crafted and lovely.The DVD however is something that only true fans will enjoy.
5,Great Time Travel Novel,"Stanley Shapiro's book about a man who goes back in time to try to stop the Kennedy assassination is a fast read and a good one. Shapiro, whose only other novel (that I've been able to locate) is a strange and well written horror fantasy called ""Simon's Soul,"" wrote the movie ""Running Against Time"" which was based on ""A Time to Remember."" The movie was very good... it cut out a few of the more depressing parts and changed the ending, but was otherwise faithful.Yes, the story about Kennedy pulling us out of Vietnam and keeping bad things across the following decades from happening might not be entirely plausible, but the story doesn't suffer because of it. Check out the book ""Time Out of Mind"" by Peter Delacorte, which tells a time travel theory about how much better the world would have been if they went back in time and killed Reagan. Authors' political views aside, both of these time travel books were very entertaining and well written."
2,LOVE HER!,"KIMBERLY S. can be one of the most exciting and audience connected djs I've seen, perhaps better suited to 'tea-dance' type, Body & Soul music and not so great for curcuit parties, but she's terrific. this is not one of her best recordings. Happy joyous feel good music. Look forward to seeing her again, but she rarely does the East coast. Cheers!"
2,Not for Sober Listeners,"It's not horrible music, but mostly mindless fluff mixed with screaming Diva noise. I found it rather forgettable & recommend saving your money & getting Masterbeat White Party XXI and Danceculture by Tracy Young instead."
4,Enjoyable read!,I especially liked the carnival scene where the hero buys tickets for the boys to throw balls until they win a prize.
5,So much to listen too!,Fabulous mix of great music. I love this album. You really get a lot for the money and all of the songs just flow into each other.
5,Excellent source of artistic movements in Poland,"Mr.Knox presents the historical and factual background as to when/why/how Poland successfully entered into the period movements of the West. Usually unknown or ignored by scholars, the wealth of Poland is shown in its architectural expression over the years. Pictures, diagrams and blueprints highlight the author's presentation; and reference to the Polish Nation's historical tragedies exhibit the will of a people to build, create and express themselves in the face of adversity. The author divides the present country into geographic areas in order to orderly present his material. Over 200 pictures are utilized. The only drawback is the failure of a greater recognition to thousands of architectural monuments on the lands of Pre-War Poland - now within the countries of the former USSR."
4,Comprehensive & objective,"A comprehensive review of the history of architecture within the present Polish borders from early romanesque to the nineteenth century and a little post-war modern. Includes plans and sections of many chapels, cathedrals, palaces and country estates with black and white photographs at back of the book. A great source for understanding the evolution of the architecture of Poland from an objective, non-romantic point of view. An excellent book."
5,Interesting and Informative,"Really enjoyed this book! Very well researched, very interesting. Loved the depiction of the notorious Axis Sally. M. Williams Fuller takes you into the unexplored world of Nazi propaganda broadcasters... all I can say is, ""Wow!""I highly recommend reading this book! Amazing!"
5,Axis Sally,"Fuller provides a very factual, but captivating story of a shadowy figure from WWII. She gives the name of ""Axis Sally' a face and gives us some insight into the personality and forces that shaped Axis Sally's behavior. While presented objectively, one can empathize with ""Sally"" as she slips deeper into deepening and futile crises.M. Fuller has obviously done a tremendous amount of research into her subject. But the mass of anectdotal facts read in a smooth and contnuous flow, pulling you along.Particularly poignant are Fuller's descriptions of Berlin during the Allied bombings with the crumbling government trying to exercise control as destruction reigns."

5,exciting history,I thought the book was quite interesting as it told you how Axis Sally got into broadcasting for the wrong side. Very good book I would recommend to others.
1,A lot of hooey,"As someone who spent weeks researching Gillars' life for a newspaper series, I can say this book is fiction woven onto a framework of historical fact. While it makes for (mostly) entertaining reading and would make a great film, don't take it all for fact. The love affair is greatly exaggerated in length and, most likely, depth. Gillars was a very colorful character, but this book uses too much Technicolor and too little fact."
5,Great Bag!,"Highly recommend this bag and other Kuryakyn products. The Classic Tour Bag has plenty of room for 1-5 day trips depending on how clever you are at packing. I travel with the Classic Tour and the Kuryakyn Tombstone Bag, that is all I need. Great product for quality and usability."
2,"Freaky-looking clowns, yikes","I just had to say that when I read the other review that said the clowns in here were too scary looking, I chuckled-- until I took a look at the book myself and saw them! Today I was in B&N and saw this book, and I must say those freaky clowns on each page ruin this book. I love these I Spy books, but although I don't get scared by clowns, I do wish they chose a set of cute little clowns instead. Try the Spooky House I Spy book-- so cute and fun!!"
5,Entertaining Fun in your House,"This is a funhouse book, It is worth a second look. Read it and you'll see, It does splendidly.Kids love it, Moms love it, Neither throw a fit, And gladly they will sit, To read this book a bit.The pictures are great! Can YOU find its mate?"
2,The clowns are awful,"My kids enjoy the I Spy series. This one has the same great concept as the other books in this series. However, the clowns in this book look evil. I know it sounds strange. Before purchasing this book take a close look at the clowns on the cover and then picture them peering at you from every page. If you are ok with that then go ahead and purchase. If you have an hesitation then buy another book in the series."
2,Not for me!,"For those people acquainted with I Spy books, you know that there is one item that appears on each picture page. Unfortunately, in the Fun House book, the recurring item is a pair of clown-dolls. Call me crazy, but those clowns are downright freaky and they frightened me! They are peering out at you from all sorts of the places and they gave me the creeps. I had intended to give this book as a gift to my 8-year-old son, but couldn't follow through. I just couldn't handle those clowns and didn't know how my kids would react. Again, maybe it's just me, but I can't recommend this book. Sorry if you think I'm a wimp, but if there are others like me, I wouldn't buy this book for your kids.I recommend I Spy Fantasy and I Spy School Days.Thanks."
3,Good,"It's a nice pewter pendant, did not exceed expectations in anyway. It is sufficient, but nothing really special. Would be better in a more expensive metal or with cut-outs maybe. It looks exactly like the picture."
4,gift,"Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loved it and wares it all the time. The necklace is adjustable, so she can ware it with many differant neck lines. I thought the Owls were a little difficult to see, but if my daughter is happy, so am I."
5,The lord has really gifted this group.,"The song, ""Testify to Love, was used in an episode of ""Touched by an Angel"", and it is excellent."
5,The best book for raising a Capitalist or Entrepreneur!,"I love economics and business. There needs to be more books like this.When I found this book for my kid, it became an instant hit with me.I love how it rymes and the pictures are kind of funny looking, but great.It teaches one of the greatest lessons, the power to save.I love how the Goose goes from a worker to owning the farm.It's the entrepreneurial way, unless you want to work hard and have nothing to show for it in the end.I'd also recommend ""Money Mama & The Three Little Pigs"" by Lori Mackey and for older kids and adults I'd recommend a classic the ""Richest Man in Babylon"" by George Clason.I also liked, ""My Dad's Job"" by Peter Glassman."
5,Excellent both live and on CD!,I bought this cd before seeing these guys perform thier stuff LIVE in NJ back in April 98. All I have to say is wow! Great stuff! I am a long time Keaggy fan but King and Dente were superb as well! ENJOY!
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a little more substance from the item description. However, for the price, it was a good read."
4,Natives and Academics,"I thoroughly enjoyed this read. The book addressed the issue of disrespecting the oral tradition of American Indian cultures by writing about them. This is something that has concerned me, especially as I look into continuing my studies through a PhD program."
3,It has Bo Derek in it,"If you buy the premise of a vindictive whale (I personally am okay with it), this is a not-half-bad actioner.It's the story of a killer whale whose pregnant mate is mowed down by a fishing boat and consequently goes Jaws on the fisheman (the incomparable Richard Harris in one of his more comparable roles) and those near and dear to him. The cinematography is... well, who cares? Charlotte Rampling and a young Bo Derek are also in this movie.Yet it remains not-half-good. The charactes and story can be summed up, oddly, but the film's slogan is ""Terror Beneath the Surface,"" as in shallow.Still, stories where a sod goes toe to fluke with a whale are too few and far between. My advice: have an extra ration of grog first."
1,"pew you , this turkey was bad then and it's bad now","like most people i saw orca after jaws and i though it was going to be a rip-off of that movie. it is not, it just stinks on it's own. richard harris over acts badly,ms. rampling acts not at all , and bo derak well she's bo and that's all. just a waste of time and not worth the price what ever it is."
3,one great big wet mammal,"It isn't as scary now as it was 37+ years ago. Still fun to watch, although my popcorn didn't hit the ceiling this time."
5,Orca,"I have watched ""Orca"",a few times, & I do not get tired of seeing these magnificent Whales & their capabilities! This movie has a grand star studded cast,& watching Bo Derek,sure does not hurt us guys eyes either :).Throughout this film,you constantly learn that in many ways,Orca's have the same human reactions,such as revenge,to mention one.The cinematography is wonderful,which makes watching this movie even more enjoyable. I highly recommend this film,to anyone interested in learning more about these most beautiful creatures,that share our Earth with us."
4,Good movie,"I saw this movie many, many years ago and had to have it for my collection. It's a great story about a killer whale whose mate is killed and with her, their unborn baby and the lengths he will go to to punish the man responsible for that death.Awesome."
4,"Orca, the killing whale",I really enjoyed the movie. I thought the movie was a dolby digital and it says that it's a dolby gigital on the case. When playing the movie it was a 2-channel sound. that was a bit disappointing. There were no features about the movie. I believe such movies should have some features.
3,"For being an ""old"" movie...","...it is absolutely watchable, but far from the classic ""Jaws"" indeed is. Except for the water I wouldn't even compare these movies. The acting/actors is/are not as legendary (at least not in ""Orca"" anyway -Harris is of course a legend, but not because of this movie). The scenes ""man/killer whale"" really works for its' time, but nothing remembarable -other than that the whole theme of the movie is anything but boring, the plot (unbelievable as it may be) works fine. Gripping at times, and overall ""Orca"" is an entertaining piece. Ennio Morricones' music suits the movie as well.A good movie!"
3,ALL'S WHALE THAT ENDS WHALE,"Whereas the more superior film JAWS was a true ""horror"" adventure, ORCA is more of a ""message"" film----don't mess with Mother Nature and her more intelligent creatures. In this one, feisty fisherman Richard Harris accidentally kills a female killer whale and its unborn baby, sending the male whale into a vengeful rampage. You may side with the whale since Harris' character is not that likeable. Charlotte Rampling is fine as the marine biologist who warns Harris not to mess with the whales; Will Sampson is a Native American fisherman who joins the quest; Bo Derek made her film debut as the young girl/crew member who gets a close up meeting with the whale; and Keenan Wynn, Robert Carradine and Peter Hooten fill out the cast. The movie sometimes plays like a National Geographic special, but some of the photography is beautiful and the finale in the ice-ridden northern Atlantic is quite chilling. Not as bad as many critics would lead you to believe."
4,Witty and Entertaining,This is my favorite season of Northern Exposure so far.I can't wait to see what happens next.This show has interesting characters who mirror their wonderful environment in scenic Alaska.
1,Northern Exposure: The Complete Third Season,The DVDs were so damaged that they kept pausing and would eventually stop. So I didn't get to see this third season in full. Very disappointing.
2,Disappointed,"We purchased this 3rd Season of Northern Exposure new, and it arrived as promised at a good price, still in the shrinkwrap. However, the doublesided disks don't all work on side B, making it a frustrating viewing. I cannot view several episodes on disc one, and am only mid-way through disc 2 of 3. Transaction went well; final product disappointing."
4,Expected a Parka!,"Unlike the first two complete seasons, this season did not come with the ""Parka Jacket"" cover. Just a box. So if you are thinking of purchasing this as a collector's series, forget it! Other than that, great show, great quality! I was very disappointed that it didn't have the Parka Jacket cover."
4,bad but at the end good,first i got it with damages. the second i got it 48-36 hours after the complain (i live in germany). no shippement of the damaged part was necesary (because of the costs). i rate it 4 stars because i had to pay taxes (amazon attached a bill for the tax guys). so at the end i payed almost all the dvd.
4,The dubbing is driving me crazy,"I'm a huge NE fan and very happy to have it on DVD. I could have waited another year, if they'd spent a little more time remastering it.For $50, I expect some level of quality. I can deal with the music rights issues; that's reality. But the cheezy matinee dubbing ? I have to look away from the screen every few minutes. It makes me dizzy watching the actors lip-sync their own words.I've purchases all three seasons so far, and I'll buy the rest, but it'd be nice if they'd hand us something that's actually ""extra"" to make up for these issues."
3,Where's The Music ?,"When this series was originally released alot of people complained that that it was rather pricey. We were told by one reviewer that the cost of retaining the original music was the reason. I figured that it was well worth a few extra bucks to keep the great music that was included in the original series. Well what happened to all that music we were paying for. Many of the episodes do not have the original music which is really disappointing to most avid fans of the show, like me. It would be nice to be able to get an answer from somebody who actually knows. Does anybody out there have a factual answer?"
4,Very enjoyable 'exposure',"Enjoyed this series so much we bought all seasons. Loved the characters, even Joel who is difficult to love..."
3,Packaged wrong,"I enjoy the show, Great CD's only issue is that I received 2 Disc 1's. Instead of receiving Disk 3 in box 3. The Disk inside was Disk 1, an identical copy of the disc in Box 1. Was looking foward to continuing on through the seasons but my viewing is now on hold as I await the situation to be corrected"
3,NORTHERN EXPOSURE - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON,Liar Liar Pants on Fire. How can they claim the reason for the added expense of Northern Exposure on DVD is because of the music rights....and yet they were able to release nearly a half a dozen titles a few years ago on VHS with no premium cost? Someone is taking advantage of us. Wonder who?
1,So discouraging...,"I decided not to purchase any of the seasons of the Great TV Series Northern Exposure after reading so many negative reviews about how the original soundtracks were replaced or altered. too bad! I was so close to buying them because i loved this show when it was on TV and all the good songs were part of the reason why I loved the show so much. BUYER BEWARE! I hope they do eventually release this series in it's original, unaltered form. The sooner the better. Blu-Ray would be nice, but id be happy with DVD. And bring back the ""zip-up parka"" packaging too!!!"
4,Prefer the original music,This set would rate 5 stars with the original scoring. Why not offer a separate platinum edition with the original music at a premium price that would reach both markets?
5,Still the best tv show ever,"The season three packaging is a definite improvement over the previous two. At least I can look at the cases and see what episodes are included and the parka is gone so that's all good. I agree that the magic of NX is in the writing, location and acting but the loss of music is considerable. I also agree with a previous reviewer that said these stupid artists should realize that their music appearing on the DVD's can only help their careers (or lack of career). I bought music by Iris Dement solely based on the song ""Our Town"" heard in the last episode of NX. Seriously, the greed in the music industry knows no bounds...but I digress. Bottom line, I love this series because it remains unchallenged in it's originality. Nothing on since can begin to compare with it, so, Universal, I'm your slave and will buy every season released on DVD, but I do hope someone out there gets a clue and by season six, the episodes are released in tact and I do mean IN TACT."
1,The music,"I want the music. I was willing to buy the series just to get it. I'm glad I read the reviews first.I loved the first few seasons of the show, and they would have been a nice bonus to the music, but without the music, not worth the money."
2,"Great show, crappy dvd set","I absolutely love Northern Exposure so the two star rating is not a reflection on that. I would give the show twelve stars if I could. It's the production of the dvd set that I am disgusted with. The first two seasons were only half seasons which is NOT reflected in the price. Also, and this is the worst and most annoying aspect, the dvd's are recorded on both sides. This means, of course, that there is almost no place where you can touch the disk without worrying about doing damage. They put six to eight episodes on a single disc. The writing to identify the disc is around the center hole and is nearly microscopic. I own two other dvd sets that are well made and are of popular recent shows so I know it is possible to make something well and keep the price reasonable. They have taken one of the best shows ever to have been made for TV and have given it packaging and production fit for the K Mart bargain bin. I mean, come on, how much does a blank disc cost anyway?"
2,Terrible quality,"The show is excellent, the DVD stinks. Don't buy it.The voices are not in sync with the actors.The original music has been replaced with garbage."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to the closing scene of ""Wake Up Call"", and the beautiful ""Coolin Medley"" played by The Chieftains. Imagine, if you can, how disappointed I was to find the music had been replaced with something else. This scene, and the original music, were what I was looking for - and it is just not the same at all. Terrible."
4,Northern Exposure - Season 3 DVD,"What can I say. Such a classic TV series, never since surpassed, and now the third season is on DVD, the season where the characters and the story lines truly excel themselves. With such a fantastic show to watch, the presentation really doesn't matter, but it is good anyhow, though could perhaps be better. Yet with a full 23 episodes, including some of the finest from the whole run of the show, this is the by far best yet of the seasons available on DVD and a must for any fan. Bring on season four!!"
4,About the Music,"Just in response to some people talking about the lack of real music in NE DVDs. While I do not condone Universal's decision on this, it really is VERY difficult to secure all the music for a retail product compared to a broadcast TV show. It's easy to license music for a show or movie, but when it comes to releasing that product as a boxed, retail copy it complicates and increases the cost immensely, so I can see why they did it. These hurdles are not impossible to overcome, just pricey and timeconsuming."
1,Season Three a Big Winner,"Northern Exposure, Season 3, was the big Emmy year for this series and the Season 3 CDs do it justice. The quality is great and the entertainment value is outstanding. If you only buy one season, make it Season 3."
5,I love Northern Exposure,"I used to watch NE late at night after getting off work and I fell in love with the series and the characters then. I mean, in what other series will you find a bush pilot that will grab up a rifle and go kill something to eat in an instant? My kinda girl... (I'm a pilot and a hunter)I don't know how the third season compares to any of the others, it's the only one I've got. But what I've seen of it so far, it's exactly as I remembered the series, interesting characters, somewhat off the wall story lines, quirky humor, and some characters that remind you of somebody you know, you just can't quite place who...After watching some of the episodes again, if anything I'm a bigger fan than years ago when I watched it. Possibly my favorite series of all time. There's no other quite like it."
2,Defective DVDs,"Several episodes freeze in the DVD players of my computers and the one attached to my TV. Am not returning the product because I paid only $17.99 and don't want to re-package and go to the post office for this amount of money. Most of the episodes are OK, and worth to me what I paid, but will probably not take a chance on paying full price for more seasons because of the possibility of manufacturing defects."
5,Great!,"I would recomend this DVD set to anyone, yes I know the original music is not included but the story lines and the actors are wonderful. These are great ""feel good"" DVD's and work well for the whole family. I look forward to the next season when released."
3,Well worth the cost!,"A wonderful series to enjoy on a rainy Sunday afternoon or any other time. Might be even better the second time around- no commercials, no interruptions, and especially not having to wait a week between programs! I highly recommend this set."
3,fun once,"An unusual updating of the earlier British horror anthologies. This time, though, the stories are much more abstract and deal with sexual themes leading to ultimate death. The center story about a drug and its unusual manufacturing process is the most bizare. Not for everyone and once is enough for me. 3 stars I think will suffice. Glad I saw it once, however!"
2,Three twisted tales that are stronger than any insomnia,"This anthology consists of three gross and twisted tales from the UK. Each tale pretty disgusting, fetishy and not horrifying. Whatever it takes to gross you out. From medical experiments with giant anatomies to men pretending to be dogs for their mistresses. There is no humor, charm, energy, or emotion from any of the actors. Most of the movie lot of it is boring setup to little payoff. You get more entertainment out of watching 3 episodes of Tales from the Crypt. If you are looking for something twisted and fetishy, this is for you, otherwise check out Creepshow. Creepshow 3 was more entertaining."
5,A superb story by a superb author,Get the inside scoop on just one of possibly hundreds of untold amazing stories of human defiance and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds to come out of World War 2.Let Ms. Striano share her rich heritage with you.
3,A Children's Book,"This is a children's book. A good one. Lots of nice pictures, and the classic stories are well written. I'm going to give it to my grandkids."
5,Sutcliff Excels,"As in Black Ships Before Troy, Rosemary Sutcliff writes a story of an epic that many adults are afraid to read for fear of the classics, in a manner that is captivating and understandable. It is by no means dumbed down and yet my children could easily understand the story.Alan Lee's watercolor illustrations are beautiful and keep the youngest listener sitting quietly to hear the story while seeing the pictures.The characters and the story are so easy to read that it is an easy transition to pick up Homer's Odysseus and read it.If you are an adult and have never read Homer's version, I highly recommend reading this for your own enjoyment as well."
5,A child's version of the Odyssey,I bought this for my 4 year old son who received a book on myths and legends and wanted to read more about Odysseus. He loves it.
5,Attention Alan Lee fans.,"Buy it for the art work if not for the retelling of the story of the Odyssey by Rosemary Sutcliff.Wonderful, masterful watercolor illustrations on just about every page!The companion book, Black Ships Before Troy, is also illustrated by Alan Lee and designed in such a way as to make the two books a matching set."
5,Fabulous!,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband who is a huge Echoes (NPR) fan. He could not wait to open the package and give it a try. He loves this cd and to our surprise, so do our teenagers. It's got some cool grooves!"
4,A Nice Easy Listen,"My first experience with ""The Dub"" was a track off of their, ""3 Cities"" album that was played on DirecTV's Zen channel from Sonic Tap. Anyway, Loved the track samples, downloaded it and it quickly became one of my daily favs. Knowing ""The Dub"" from, ""3 Cities"" I decided to add to the collection with this self titled 2 disc album. I really like it but I don't think as much as I enjoy, ""3 Cities."" I really like the eastern lounge vibe of, ""3 Cities."" This album is really chill, I like it alot, I just would prefer less western classical vibes."
4,CHILLED OUT SOUNDTRACK,"I purchased this record based on a recommendation by Amazon. I wasnt dissapointed. It has lush strings, strong dub bass & beautiful female vocals. It's as if Bill Laswell did a Bollywood soundtrack. Perfect for a Sunday drive or walk."
3,pretty good,"very nice chill music for sure, but it dose kind of get dull in some songs. Over all it's not bad."
2,"disappointing muzak ""dub""","Disk one is not dub and it is not compelling. A better title might be ""Bombay Elevator Music."" Saccharine melodies and treacly arrangements make this sound like something one might hear in a shopping mall. I am also a fan of chill and ambient modalities, and this is neither of those either. On the upside, this is not music that will disturb the neighbors. Guaranteed never to break your chain of thought. One star for this half of the title.Disk two, on the other hand, is a collection of remixes of disk one material. This disk alone would be a three star album. Good beats, judiciously fat bottom end, cloying strings toned down and the treacle drained from the arrangements, it's a nice chill vibe that actually rises on occasion to dubness. Too bad it's not available as a stand-alone ""volume 2."""
2,summertime summertime madonna madonna,"the first time i heard this record i thought it was madonna, as far as im concerned this artist is a madonna-clone, im not surprised she isnt around today,the track itself is very generic sounding for its time, it has a fairly catchy hook thats so lightweight it floats. i know it was a hit when it was released probably because people thought it was madonna, it actually sounds like a track lifted off of madonnas debut album..they say imitation is the best form of flattery.....file this under ""madonna clones""..."
2,Typical Asian-American formula,"While Ching Sledge deserves applause for the effort in producing fiction dealing with Chinese diaspora history (rare), she is, like so many Asian-American writers (particularly females- Amy Tan, etc.) caves in to an ingratiating assimilationist ""tourist"" attitude that is appealing to non-Asians, but often highly offensive to Asians. Furthermore, there are gaping holes in the historical accuracy of the story, which sweeps too easily past the great tensions that existed during the period."
4,not real sure,"Flax lays so many things out there that it's hard to tell what to think about it. After this ran on Feinbaum's show and after reading it, who knows if what he says is true. It's very interesting and I can't doubt that it's possible that Stallings left Alabama angry, that DuBose was a failed powermonger, and that Price just wasn't quite cut out for Bama. Can Shula bring the team back around? Who knows, but Flax thinks he'll have to be a hard-[baller] to do it. It's going to take more than the last three coaches have done, that's for sure."
3,Reads like a Cliff Notes book,"Just not alot of meat or new information in this book, Very disappointed of the coverage of the Price firing, there was like 1 or 2 pages devoted to it. Overall, the book is not a bad read, but there just isn't a ton of new information here and the ""inside"" sources appear to be a couple of his old roommates. Could have been alot better."
5,One question...,"just how crazy is the desire for human decency? If you are intrigued by this question, then you will agree that this is the best novel ever written."
4,helpful and entertaining reading,"this book is a must for anyone planning to search for love online. it is also entertaining, but more than that, it is right on in defining human relationships and the mistakes we all make. The author must be a psychologist as well as a good writer."
2,Good horror stories,"Of the five books I bought about Internet dating, I ranked this one four or five. It has the word ""online"" on the cover, but it seemed to me that most of the material and experience was ""pre-Internet"", i.e., personal ads in newspapers and that ""online"" was added to make the book seem current. That said, however, it did have some good horror stories to serve as a warning of what could happen with personal ad/Internet dating."
2,Warped,"This product out of the box was very impressive. A substantial sheet but the first time I used it, it really warped. It is still useful for baking foods that give out liquid or greasy foods as it has the jelly roll edge. I will not use it for jelly roll or cookies. I purchased another stainless cookie sheet for nearly 1/2 the price at a local cooking outlet which has not warped and performs beautifully."
3,Mine also warp in the oven at 325-350 degrees,"I like how the cookies come out, but do not appreciate the warping. Is it possible some of these are inferior quality?"
2,hair color applicator gave me grey hair!,"The Color diffuser that is necessary for this product can only be used one time. NO replacements come with package. You must send away for refills at $10.00 a pop and $5.95 shipping. In addition, it comes with complicated, long and confusing instructions. The one time use is not worth the money. I advise doing your own coloring or paying someone in a salon $40.00 to apply it.The only ""joy"" that is delivered by this product goes exclusively to the seller."
1,"Nice Stories, but it's to up sell you other training materials","Good stories in each chapter which leave you wanting more but no call to action, no golden egg, same ole stuff. The whole book is one big sales pitch to sign up for her email list which tries to UP sale you into joining coaching seminars which are in the hundreds of dollars.She does have free downloads, free news letters but if you want the real good stuff that's gonna cost you.As real estate agents we are so easily suckered."
1,old stuff,I was hoping that this book with give me some new insite and really it was nothing more than what I already was doing or had done. Very disappointed.
4,A good introduction to Carver,"A good introduction to Carver, who was a man of charm and impracticality, intensity and feminine tenderness, humility and immense ego, and who was simultaneously devoted to Christian orthodoxy and an ideosyncratic strain of nature mysticism. Kremer's introduction is nicely written and strikes a proper balance between hero-worship and debunking. Despite the black scientist's unusual combination of personality traits, his virtues and faults remained largely constant throughout his career, so some of Kremer's examples seem repetitious. That's no problem. In books like this one, you can skip and skim in good conscience."
1,Utter Trash!,"Strange that Marxists like Chandra can claim to know so much about ""communalism"" when their poltical icons have been responsible for so much bloodshed in the name of their communist beliefs.Avoid this book unless you want to get the impression that social conflict is especially unique to India and that its perpetrators are ONLY Hindus!"
1,poor product,"I thought that I would recieve a great new instrument, instead it was not good at all. I had no problem returning the guitar and I purchased the same model from a local dealer!"
5,great story,"well its a bit different, but i loved it, its about a poor family and all the things they have to overcome, its very sweet."
2,Alma De Hierro,Pues la calidad de imagen y sonido de 1 a 10 es un 9.Lo que si me parece sumamente importante decirle a todos es queLamentablemente le quitaron muchisimas partes de la telenovela originalQue se vio en la television.O sea que Para este DVD hicieron como un resumen de todo lo mejor.
4,We think it is fun!,"My 5yo received this last month for a birthday present, and within a few days had declared this the BEST gift he received. His 10yo brother also likes it, and enjoys playing with it with him. I like it because they play together! Much like an (admittedly, old-fashioned) arcade game, you pop the basketball through the hoop, and your player rises up toward the top -- first one to the top wins.The music is loud and can be annoying, but ours at least has a setting where you don't have to play the sounds.I would have purchased several to have on hand for gifts at this price ($7.50) if Target wasn't charging more than the product price to ship it. Recommended age, 5-8."
3,"Good quality, but needs a better description.","Product is constructed very well and is of very good quality. the leather, rivets, and attachments appear that they will take on years of use.Despite the descriptions, it would be nice to know if the length described was for the ""overall"" length or just the strap length. While the double rings seem like a good idea, my keys just ended up getting tangled with each other and I now just use the larger ring."
5,Jazz Joy,"This early Freddie Hubbard session remains one of his very best; a total jazz joy from start to finish. A line in the Amazon product description aptly sums it all up:""This is one of those stunning Blue Note records where the musicians mesh and the tunes, arrangements and solo get as close to perfection as one can.""Very true. Hard to top the songs and the playing on this lively recording. Hubbard is outstanding as expected on trumpet, and McCoy Tyner also thrills on piano, and Sam Jones is steady on bass, but the real surprise --- at least for me --- was the sax playing of Tina Brooks. Very underrated player. The whole album swings. An undisputed classic."
5,Open Sesame. Freddie Hubbard.,"One of the best trumpet player in Jazz. Freddie is at his best in this album. Together with Going Up and ready for Freddie, it is the perfect collection of the Best he ever did during his career."
1,Worst! I WANT MY MONEY!,I NEVER EVEN GOT THE BOOK. I HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM MY MONEY AND I WANT A FULL REFUND NOW.
2,Not worth the price,I loved this anklet when I first got it but the link to the clasp is very weak & it has broken twice on me. Not worth the price.
3,Disappointed,"Not as shown. In person, mine doesn't look like flowers - the center is blob-like, and the 'petals' are not round like in the picture. It would appear the picture was skewed/squished a bit horizontally to make the flowers look round, and they're definitely NOT.Otherwise, appears to be good quality, and shipping was quick."
3,If it is not Scottish I don't care,"I thought Scottish Poetry of the eighteenth century had too many lackadaisical sentiments in the sense that it was not social understandable by the former generation of our society.In our society[so greatly in need of reformation]we need books like this as guidelines to the way we live and die.I loved the gripping saga of poems by the late George Dawson and as the great Laurel Michaels once said ""tis' better to walk the fine lines of humanity than to live in a world of indigestable sympathies toward the poor and lowly""."
3,Ankle Support,"I bought 2 of these for my daughter, but they are not comfortable to wear so she doesn't wear them - so that was a waste of money..."
2,"It's really well made, but poorly designed.","It was true-to-size and 'fit'. The sewing and materials are very good, BUT!!!...It does not hold the ankle at a 90deg angle. The 'stiffening' isn't stiff at all, and not only offers ZERO support, but leaves a bulky u-shape that puts pressure on the soft tissue around the ankle. The material is bulky and does not fit into shoes easily or comfortably. It has no stretch around the calf so it bites into the hamstring & achilles tendon. The lacing is difficult to use at best, it has to be completely un-laced and re-laced every time the brace is removed/put on. Also, the lacing is angled such-that it does not tighten at the 'bend' in the front of the ankle, so it does not hold the ankle steady forward/back either. Since this brace offered no side-side or forward-back support, didn't fit in my shoes, and was actually painfully tight around the calf, (in other words, it dosen't do anything the description says it'll do) I returned it."
3,not sure,"haven't tried it yet, bought for my Nissan altima, but on the bottle it says for bicycle tires patch, then in the instruction it says for any tire, a bit confusing,will check with the vendor to verify."
5,A Great Story - Ready for the Big Screen,"Hitler is universally viewed as a monster, and the evidence of his evil has been both well documented and analyzed. The majority of this evidence largely involves his acts of cruelty and brutality against those with whom he had no relationship. In this excellent book the author adds another aspect of Hitler's persona, namely, what he was capable of doing to those he supposedly cared for. By presenting this more personal aspect of Hitler's inhumanity, the author adds a new, fresh and disturbing dimension to our understanding of Hitler."
5,Beautiful wind chimes,Beautiful sound! Great product. My fourth purchase of this brand and melody. Perfect gifts. I have had same chimes for 6 years and they are still in wonderful condition. These chimes are a bit loud so may not be for everyone.
5,Great value,"Bought as a gift, they were well received.They look / sound wonderful, and are well made."
5,A Must For Any Corvair Owner,"This book has saved my life, not to mention a lot of time, in restoring and maintaining my 1964 Spyder Convertible. Many thanks to Mr. Finch for the many photos and drawings. Also for easy to understand language used in the book."
4,Home remedies for Corvair; A few photos/drawings a bit crude,"The author gives information in this book which is probably not compiled anywhere else.This book is probably the only one around which gives details on how to keep the Corvair running. Common-language terminology makes the author easy to understand, and Corvair ancedotes keep the reader entertained.The one drawback is that many of the illustrations are hand-sketches. Such sketches may or may not be useful to the reader when trying to use them to supplement the text. Similarly, some of the photos are too dark to be useful, though most are quite good.I generally enjoyed the book."
5,corvair,"I had been searching all over for this book. I found it on Amazon. Condition was as advertised, price was great. It arrived on time."
2,Boo Yahari,Que les paso se aquerdan de Mensaje en La Luna 1993caundo se cambiaron a cumbia no me gusto su musicaQue les paso?!
5,Great Book!,"I read this book as a child in the 1960s and loved it then - it was one of my favorites along with Black Beauty (can you tell I love horses?). I came across it again in a box of old stuff, and re-read it, and it brought back all the same feelings as when I was young. A great story about a great horse - any young horse-lover will enjoy it!"
3,Expected a bit more...,"...something. Seemed like the typical story of an eastern block sociopath. Maybe I'm missing some deeper meaning. If your looking for an existentialist commentary about the vacuousness of life, you may like this."
5,This hand cleaner IS the bomb!,"I bought a smaller quantity of this same cleaner available at Home Depot in a pump bottle. Smells great. Contains plenty of solvent that I found to be very effective at cutting through brake fluid, EP oils and road grime. Has enough pumice to help carry off dirt, but not so much that it clogs its own pump like some other products often do."
5,Must read,Anything that will help improve your marriage is a must read book. I will do anything to make that happen. I highly recommend this book.
1,Very Religious - No help at all,"I didn't expect this book to talk about religion so much. I was looking for a way to add some spice to marriage, but instead the book just quoted the bible and told you respect your wife. That I already do. If you want a book that has ideas for dates and fun adventures to share, this isn't it."
2,what happened,Pure cheese. What happened this album isnt anywhere near the other albums by them. If youre thinking of buying blue october. Dont buy this one. Buy incoming thats there best. I still hope they come back on there next album.
4,"Solid, Usable Crate","We purchased this crate to carry our cat to and from the vet and other places. Our cat is large (not fat, just big!), about 19 lbs. We needed something that would be sturdy and able to support his weight and large size.One of the main advantages to this crate is the twisting locks that hold it together as opposed to the clip down ones. I used to work in a pet store and had to assemble massive amounts of all sorts of carriers and crates. The kind with metal locks are the best, and these twist ones are next. Please choose the twist locks for your pet's safety.The metal doors and latching devices are also an excellent and must have feature. The way the door opens, it's impossible for my cat to figure out or do from the inside. (He's already figured out how to open it from the outside!)The carrier provides just enough room for him without it being excessively large or bulky to carry."
3,Cheaper than before,"I had this Kennel awhile back and left it at the vet by mistake and they got rid of it. They don't make the same version now, the new version is all plastic. But the problem with the new version is that the top doesn't open and lay flat so you can use two hands to get your pet inside (try getting a frightened cat in the carrier with one hand!). I finally found this version but it seems flimsier than I remember and a chunk of plastic came off when I got it leaving a hole on the side (it must have been hit on the side and it literally knocked the plastic out like a cookie cutter. Too much trouble to send back so I kept it. Also, I wanted the larger version, but I can't find it anywhere now. This is a bit of a squeeze for my 13 lb. cat."
3,ok product; need something sturdier,"I bought this carrier because I have a big cat who HATES going to the vet; I needed something with 2 doors to get him in the carrier more easily. The front door has come off multiple times, and with his weight the knobs on the side barely hold the carrier together, even with plastic zip ties. I'm looking for a new carrier that holds together more securely."
4,Super Sweet!,This was such a good book. When Mrs. Reg gets a boyfriend the Saddle Club accidently tries to separate them; their hilarious antics make for enjoyable reading. Added bonus: the Saddle Club has trouble riding some of the sweetest ponies at the stable! They're not perfect! Yay!
1,Patience for the Saddle Club is wearing thin,"I have to admit the more I read the Saddle Club, the less I like it. The plots are trite and predictable at best and this one is no different. For example, it was completely obvious that Mr.Stowe and Mrs.Reg liked each other but the Saddle Club didn't figure it out until the very end of the book. Same with Dime and Penny: of course they missed each other!!! How could Mrs.Reg, Max, Stevie, Carole, and Lisa not see it right away? Instead they were all practically thinking that Dime was going to die! How stupid can ya get?I realize that this series isn't really aimed at an almost 16 year old, and to be honest I only read the Saddle Club books when I have absolutely nothing else to read, I just go through books so fast. But really, Bonnie Bryant could do much better and at least she has in the Pine Hollow series, which is really a much better choice than any of the trite and childish Saddle Club books."
2,"Eh, okay I guess","I agree that Stevie was starting to get on your nerves. Yeah, your boyfriend doesn't want to go to your dance, but he had a reason. So why can't you just let it pass instead of it practically breaking you up?I always thought that the Saddle Club was smart, but the more books a read, the dumber I think they are. A chapter or two and I knew Mrs. Reg and Mr. Stowe liked each other. They gave all of the signs. Come on, I'm their age and I figure out the ""mysteries"" before they do!! Even Striaght-A Lisa can't seem to figure easy things out.You can read it I guess, but I don't suggest it."
3,Stevie really got on my nerves,"This book was okay...but what I HATED about it was how Stevie kept complaining about her boyfriend not going to the dance. Like, the whole book she got me mad. Stevie's only like, what, 13, 14, 15? And she cares about her boyfriend! Too much in fact. She should care more about her grades in school. Any way, I liked how Ms. Bryant showed how horses have feelings and can miss eachother. I did like the ending of the book. That was cool. So, i guess this book was pretty good. But please try to cut out some of the boyfriend junk."
2,buyer beware - extension phones?,"Be warned that this, and some other expandable phone systems, do not allow an additional handset to easily join an existing conversation. The handset currently using the line must first put the outside party on hold, figure out which of the expansion handsets wants to join the conversation, ring that specific handset, and then remove the hold condition. Not exactly convenient.On the plus side, sound quality and range are good, and as advertised, the phones generate no interference to degrade wi-fi networks."
2,Okay but limited,"We have had these phones for awhile and they do not live with you well. I suspect that I will dump them and find another DECT phone system that has all the features we want. We came from a Uniden 5.8 phone system and sound quality thru out the house is almost perfect with these new phones unlike the old 5.8 that we had.But, the volume never gets very loud on the ringer or during calls. It does not let you know of message waiting unless you walk up and really stare at the screen. The date format is European, the hidden mute function is a pain, no headset jack is bad news, especially with the volume limitations, the dance to share a phone call or transfer it to a different phone is awkward at best.I understand this system came from Europe originally and they just did not do enough to make it right for the American market when they started selling it here. Better attention to details and interface and this would have been a great phone."
4,Uniden Cordless,"This phone works great and boasts of a higher frequency channel for wireless transmisson.Pros: compact design, phonebook of 100 numbers, Caller Id, battery life( i charge it periodically and it never ran out of charge so am not too sure about it.) , handset finder, dual voltage.Cons: The range covered is very limited like 75 feet. cannot load custom ringtones and the ringtones volume is ok not too loud, just ok and might be difficult to find it if falls between the sheets and stuff."
3,Average,Phone works fine. Other than that it's not my favorite cordless. The buttons are a little slow (to dial) and reception is average.
5,Why is this STILL not out on blu ray yet???,"We have been waiting YEARS for this amazing series to come on blu ray. At this point I don't even care if it's not a fancy decorative box set. In fact, I'm learning that the quality usually suffers with this kind of packaging. Just put the seasons on blu ray already please!"
5,Best Ever,"The West Wing is by far one of the best tv series out there. Not only does it teach alot of the behind the scenes of the White House, it has great characters that you come to know well and love."
1,Junk,"Doesn't work, it just broke the hairs instead of pulling them. My wife cannot shave her underarms due to reactions from the razor and always tweezes, so were so excited to finally get an epilator to maybe save her some time. Unfortunately this is not it. It did not pull one single hair from her under arms, but after a few passes it broke about half of them. We are returning it and trying one of the other manufacturers. My advice, don't waste your time on this one, look elsewhere."
2,Not worth it.,"I bought one of these at Wal-Mart today for $25.Tomorrow it goes back to the store.I have been epilating for 5 years now (Braun) and wanted a new epilator.(My wife told me they wear out and need to be replaced) At only $25, I thought, ""What the hey! I'll give it a shot!""After 70 minutes on just my upper thighs, I realized this product is ineffective junk. I had to get my old Braun out and redo both thighs.Even so, the nearly-worn-out Braun only took me 20 minutes to do my legs from waist to toe, including the thighs that I had to redo. I am still looking for a new epilator, but I do not recommend this one.I gave it two stars instead of one because it IS painless. It just isn't effective.As I was repackaging the unit, I noticed the power rating on the transformer; 3 volts.The two Brauns I own both use a 12 volt transformer. . . . Something to think about.(Yes, I am a guy. I have rather severe OCD and I epilate to avoid unconscious hair plucking, which gets badly infected)"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY !!!,"This product is terrible...I bought this product at Wal-Mart for $25.00. It was for my daughter, but, I thought I would use it also. After about an hour, my daughter brought this epilator to me and said ""It sucks...and I give up!"" She still had to shave after using this product. The product did not remove almost any of the hair. Those that were ""removed"" were only partially removed and still left a stubble or a hair about 1/8"" in length. Terrible product. I gave this product two stars, because, it was relatively pain free, but, that is the only reason. This epilator is being returned to the store today. Don't waste your time or money. Unfortunately this is my first time using an epilator, so, I don't know about any other epilator products to advise you of a good one."
1,Waste!!,"What a waste of time and money. This does not work. After 45 minutes I didn't even have one thigh done and still had to shave it. It is being returned!!! Don't waste your money, use a razor."
2,"Loud, ect","I just bought this one. I'd never used an epilator before, so I'm not sure how other epilators work, but so far I'm not too pleased with my purchase.For one thing, it's extremely loud. It sounds like a buzz saw, which is especially annoying when I use it near my face. (I don't even like using it when other people are in the house, for that reason.) Plus, It only gets the longer hairs, so in order for it to do any good, I need to go without shaving for a 2-3 days to build up a good bit of stubble. This is very inconvenient, if I have a date the next morning. Also, it takes a really long time and never seems to get all the hair. It took me a good ten minutes just to do one armpit (and I still had to shave afterward.)I wish I could take this back to Walmart where I bought it, but they probably don't want since it's been opened. Oh, well--it's something, and I'll make it work."
4,Need to Buy New Scales,"There add says shipping weight is 34#, UPS shipping weight is 7#. Just another over charge for shipping. If you want more for your product just say so!"
3,"Great look, cheap quality.","Loved this chair for first three months, but then it fell apart because of some cheap wood holding the screws on the leggs. Would recommend paying more for a better quality piece of furniture as this broke too easily."
1,Vanity bench,"This product is not worth the money it cost. The wood split when I was putting in screws, after about two months the whole thing just collapsed and I had to trash the product. It was not able to be fixed. It was only used in the morning to put on makeup, I think it may be made for a child's weight. Over 120 lbs., it can't take the stress."
3,This is NOT the Beatles!,"This is a collection of instrumentals done by anonymous studio musicians, ""Norwegian Wood and his Orchestra."" The music is okay, but most online services list this CD as being by the Beatles, when it is obviously not - Brad Howard, ""The World Beatles Forum"""
1,I totally disagree,"I'm amazed at the other reviews! This is the first book I have read by this author - and it doesn't inspire me to dip into other works. Ridiculous story line, full of unbelievable events with unconvincing ""hero"". 342 pages of silly drivel. A waste of time and money"
5,Great for use arond the house,"I checked out all the reviews before I bought this and am glad that I did. I just bought my first laptop and hated to leave it lying around the house. I was looking more for something to protect it when I wasn't using it, but find that works great as a lap desk. It keeps my legs from getting over heated and gives more surface for the laptop to set on, so I am not trying to balance it on my lap or work off the coffee table where I have to hunch over to type and look at the screen. Definitely worth the cost. My only dislike is that the top does not close, but it isn't anything that will stop me from using it."
3,Nothing special,"I don't know why I keep buy Bellydance Superstars videos. They have become lackluster to me. The 3D gimmick is worthless. Thankfully they have it so you can watch it normally. On both 3D's the picture is fuzzy with glasses and the coloring is HORRIBLE!!! Watch it normally, there is no reason to watch it in 3D."
4,love those bdss,"I love these gals, the 3d thing didn't work for us, but that's what's great, you can watch it on a normal setting, out entire family enjoyed this. These performance videos keep us wanting to get better and better at our dancing....thank you ladies!!!!"
4,BD Superstars 3D,"I enjoyed watching volume two more than the first video. I think it is better to watch in regular format rather than 3D, which is hard on the eyes. The second video has a behind the scenes section that is fun to watch and I liked the travel section in Morrocco. I have all the BD Superstars videos in my collection."
2,Disappointed,"not a very good book. Was VERY vague few options, varieties, and just useless info... out dated"
3,Good basic info but...,"Too old info, there is too much New greenhouse information left out here. It seems the author has a desire to help but does'nt know of any of the new break-threws in this industry. Greenhouses have changed 100% from the wooden A framed house. Now they have many different designs thst can save heating cost 50%. Get some new info on greenhouse and you'll have more FUN."
2,Virtually Useless,"Well, for $10 I guess I can't be TOO upset. The information was old, and if you actually want to BUILD a greenhouse you will find no help here. In fact, this book could be more appropriately titled, 'Greenhouse Theory'. But even with regard to the theory, there wasn't much here that could not have been learned simply googling a little while.I was very disappointed."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"Was very disappointed with this book. There just isn't much knowledge wedged between the covers. As one witty critic wrote (about a different book), ""The covers of this book are too far apart."""
3,Good Read,"Want to build your own greenhouse. Books addresses some problems associated with air circulation, temperature control, building materials etc..."
4,Cute & fun,I got this Spider-man backpack clip for my son last year (he was 7) & he still uses it this year on his backpack. It still looks new. I am his Mom & I think it is really cute. He thinks it is fun. It is great for any age (once old enough so won't swallow clip). It is small enough to take anywhere or clip onto pretty much anything. But bigger than I thought it would be so also fun to use as an action figure.
1,Not what I expected,"This clip is cute, but it is a soft, plush-type clip. Not what I expected. The picture made me think it was a plastic smaller (2-3"") clip for a backpack or jacket, not a ""stuffed doll"" of Spiderman and about 5""."
2,Beware!,"I believe that the Bible is the inerrant, infallible Word of God. If you agree...this book is not for you. THE COMPLETE JESUS contains so called ""quotes"" of Jesus from sources that are not approved by normal Christian authorities.. These ""extra biblical"" writings are not of interest to me. Purchasing the book was a mistake on my part.A better choice would be:THE GREATEST WORDS EVER SPOKENOVER 1,900 STATEMENTS OF JESUS ORGANIZED UNDER MORE THAN 200 TOPICS by Steven K. Scott"
3,MAD ABOUT IT........,"I purchased this item for MY SON. My son got a toothbrush in the mail, but it was not the one that I ordered. They sent him a toothbrush with THE LITTLE MERMAID on it. I was highly upset but I delt with it because I am currently in iraq. Just please make sure that they send you the right product when u order it."
4,Works well,"I bought this for my 4 yr old to replace a cheeper one that broke after about 6 months. My son loves it, and likes to brush his teeth with it. No problems with it so far."
3,Bitter Sweet Feeling,I love the fact that the characters Pooh and Tigger keeps my 2 year old son motivated to brush his teeth 2x a day. Only thing I don't like about the electronic toothbrush is you can not replace the Head-Brush only the batteries.
4,Kinda big for a kid's mouth.,"This brush works fine and its motion is gentle enough for a child's mouth, but the brush itself seems kind of big for a child's small mouth. Nonetheless, my four-year-old daughter enjoys using it."
3,Just okay,I was not completely happy with the condition of the lamp. There were a few imperfections on the shade. I may have returned it but it seemed to much of a hassel.
1,Not happy,"I received the lamp and I like it. However. the shade did not come with the lamp and I had to purchase that separately. In this case, it was definitely not worth the price I paid for it."
3,"Great as a scientific guide, not so much as a field guide","If you're a mushroom hunter, this guide isn't a great field guide. This book breaks out the mushrooms into their scientific classes. It does have very nice pictures of the mushrooms, notes on edibility, and notes on commonly confused mushrooms (edible vs poisonous, etc.). However I think this book could've been a little more helpful with some cross referencing; something a simple as putting a page number or picture next to the poisonous mushroom that is often confused with an edible one. Maybe a section where someone could search out a mushroom by it's appearance (i.e. red mushrooms, gills, 1 inch tall or less, etc) for those people (like me) who are trying to identify a mushroom they may come across on a trail. Otherwise, it's a great little pocket guide and it will be going in my camper nonetheless."
1,Iccckkk...,"I smelled this one because my ex wears it for men and I loved it... Well, this smelled horrid to me, but I like oriental fragrances better. I would consider wearing the mens' fragrance before spraying on the womens'."
3,Not Swinging,"I purchased this when exploring the Lifestyle (Swinging). This book, while well-written enough to read very easily, is NOT about Swinging, or the emotional components of a couple who chooses to bookend playful encounters with others with a rock-solid relationship. The events, while illuminating, were cyclical in nature, and though each vignette or affair (and each one had more of the air of an ""affair"" about it then a swing encounter) has its own meaning, after several each one seemed to be ""more of the same."" It is interesting reading, but it is not illustrative of a couple having chosen the Swinger Lifestyle. Because it reads so well, though, it can be valuable to understand how one person reacted emotionally to that corner of our lives called ""sex"" or ""intimacy"" that people try to cordon off from the rest of the world."
5,True to Life Reading,"This is an EXCELLENT book and it could easily be called Life 101, or maybe Marriage 101. The author openly discusses the arrangements of her open marriage with her husband and all the downfalls that resulted. In the end (after many hurdles) the open arrangement ends and their marriage begins anew.It's a heart wrenching story that's jam-packed with events that keep you reading. But it's not that you read it for the frank sexuality that is discussed. You can't put the book down because you feel at one with Jennifer Gates and have the desire to know more and more as you read.I'd recommend this book to all my friends. It's well written and flows easily. It's a must read for anyone who loves to understand the human condition!"
4,Affairs hurt!,"This book is useful for anyone injured by the affair of a partner. What makes this book unique is that it is from the perspective of a woman who had an open marriage. When the sexual relations of her husband became emotionally intimate (not just sexual), she went through the same cascade of feelings (betrayal, hurt and anger) of any love partner who partner loves another. This is more about how injurious affairs are than about open marriages."
5,Changing the Game,"The Williams Sisters are SuperBad No DOubt! I have followed there Successful Run in various tournements&Applaud them to the fullest.they are changing the Game of tennis always 1&2 in the world&Dominating there Competition with ease.ALthea Gibson,Arthur Ashe&a few other African American Tennis Players Opened the Door for them but the Williams Sisters are Kicking it Wide Open.these Sisters are Very Talented,Beautiful,On Top of there Game&Very Grounded People who know what they want to do&are Very Exciting to watch with there Powerful game.Just Like Tiger Woods Flipped the Golf Game the Williams Sisters have Flipped Tennis as we know it.Much Props!!!"
3,"Good Overview, but not from Renowned Scholar","This is a pocket-sized guide that provides a thematic overview of all the books of the bible. It's handy for reference, but be WARNED: The author, Raymond Brown, is NOT the Famous Catholic Scholar Raymond ""Edward"" Brown, even though Amazon lists it as so. This is not his usual publisher, and the book contains none of Brown's insightful, critical analysis on topics such as authorship and manuscript dating.(Plus, the Scholar always uses his middle name -Edward - in his writings.)For those of you looking for an in-depth guide to the New Testament, I HIGHLY recommend Raymond Edward Brown's ""Introduction to the New Testament""."
3,"Not bad, but not amazing","I purchased this product and have been using it for about a month now. It is fairly solid and it grips the sides of the bathtub well. My biggest concern right now is what I see happening at the edge of the white rubber grips. First of all, the grips have been torn at the edges and will continue to tear because of the way that this caddy expands/contracts. At the same spots, I have also started to see rust forming. I have been able to wipe it away so far, but I predict that rust will become a problem.That being said, I am happy with the size, shape and versatility of this tub caddy."
3,"Hall of Fame, or Hall of Morality?","Pete Rose is not a great man. Let's all get past this, as this is pretty obvious to everybody. You say it would destroy the integrity of the game to let him in the Hall? Ty Cobb once beat up a spectator in the stands who had no hands. He purposely drove his metal cleats into players' shins while sliding into second base. If he's in, Rose is in.This book isn't a cry for help, and don't count on a 100% truthful account of the facts. It is Pete Rose's side to his story. Spend a couple hours to either fuel your hatred of him, or further your compassion for him. Bottom line: Men aren't inducted into the Hall...Players are."
1,Who's worse?,"At least it didn't take the Lotto liar 14 years to admit she lost the ticket.No one care anymore, Pete."
3,A Good Confession,"This bookw was a good confession. Thats pretty much what it was. It was Pete Rose finally admitting the inevitable: that he bet on baseball. However, he did it in some fashion, generating some great revenue at the same time.I definitely think that every baseball and historian needs to read this book as it is a part of history. However, it can be read quickly and briskly."
3,Okay,"There are 6 things that the Hall of Fame voting is based on. They are based upon: the players record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contribuitons to the team(s) he played on. Do the math. Should Pete be elected?"
1,Shallow,"Ghost written BS. A poor campaign for reinstatement so he can get into the hall of fame. Great ball player of the past. always an immature, narcisist who wouldn't know truth or honor if it beaned him in the forehead. Read the various articles over the years from Sports Illustrated if you want to know about the real Pete Rose. Read the book if you want to read a hallmark card to himself."
5,American Psycho!!!,"I bought MY PRISON WITHOUT BARS as soon as my local Barnes & Noble opened today and then I spent the rest of the day reading it. This is one of the truly great sports memoirs of all-time. Not because it's literature or all that dramatic -- but, because it's the self-portrait of a great American hero who turned himself inside out and emerged as a great American villian. Pete Rose operates under a set of ethics and rules unique to superstar atletes who think they're gods living among mortals. This mindset has resulted in his offering up an autobiography that's as bizarre as it is compelling. In its own strange way, this is a sports classic."
2,Come On Pete,"This book was not really worth the time it took to read it. I was expecting a David Wells type tell all but Pete just goes on about his mistreatment. I once believed Pete should be in the Hall of Fame and signed a few petitions but never again. After reading Fay Vincent's book I was hoping this would show the other side of the coin. No such luck. Rose constantly finds somebody else to blame for his problems or throws down the terms his therapist uses to give him an excuse. Read something else.I recommend: Perfect I'm Not - David Wells, The Last Commissioner - Fay Vincent, Catcher in the Wry - Bob Uecker, Zim - Don Zimmer and any by Yogi Berra."
3,A fine case of whine,"In the book, Rose seems to be able to find ways to blame nearly everyone else for his failures. When he finally admits to having gambled on baseball while actively participating in it, it feels like a confession without realling confessing. He simply wants to be in the Hall of Fame and will say anything to make it happen.Now, I believe that Pete deserves the honor of being in the Hall. During the 70s, nobody played baseball like he did. He is truly one of the greats of the game. Had he admitted 14 years ago that he did bet on baseball, he probably would be in the Hall today but his own stubborness along with his ability to shift the blame for his problems to anything and everything but himself now probally make this a moot point.Overall, this is an interesting book about a talented ballplayer but a flawed human being. Don't expect, however, to learn what makes Pete tick."
1,What a joke!,How are you supposed to know when Rose is lying and when he isn't lying? This is garbage. Rose cares about one thing: ROSE. He'll say whatever it takes to make a buck. This clown gives JERKS a bad name. I wish he would just go away.
1,Open Mouth...Insert Foot,"All this book has done is manage to pile on more criticism on Pete Rose the man. There is no denying that Pete Rose the player is 'hall of fame' material. But what he did to the game, destroying its integrity by betting on it, is inexcusable. For some time I felt, sure, let him back into baseball, he's done his time. But now, I realize that he's nothing more than a liar, a cheater, and a hustler. I hope Selig makes his decision soon (and denies him reinstatement), and we can all be rid of this nonsense once and for all."
1,Ego Ego Ego,"An interesting read if you want to explore the ego of someone totally out of control with reality. The man broke the rules and cannot accept that what he did was wrong. A good ballplayer, but wonder about his real worth as a human."
1,I would never call this book a Bible.,"I read this book several times & found it too general. Not at all what I expected. I was looking for a step by step review to convert a bus into a 1st class RV. It boggs down in detail about technical fact to metal strengths & fasteners, etc. I'm know this information is important, little attention is paid to the nuts & bolts of bus conversions. I'm sure the book could / should be more specific. There are 'Standards' that should be followed from Bus Conversions to RVs (RVIA & NFPA Standards) A real ""HOW TO"" book could be written & this was not it! I'd like to see a book that tells me ""This is the way to do it"" & then tell me why. We can apply such knowledge to whatever 'style' conversion we wish to do on whatever model bus we wish to convert. This book is NOT as good as you would believe it is from reading the ""Boards"""
2,book should not have bible in title,"book gives very insightfull tips and guidelines, however the book is very incomplete and does not go into depth on electrical, driveline, etc. if your into converting an old gm bus or an eagle it's a fairly decent book to start with. but if you want a bible, forget it"
3,Small book,Not much for the money. Good starter book but everything in the book is needs more research before you would attempt to do them.
4,Very detailed,I have ordered a few of these figures. This one looks exactly like the photo! Very pleased.Note in the description that these are 3+ inch figures.
3,horrible rash,"I tried this for a week as a supplement. I got a horrible rash, burning across my entire body for thirty mins. I had to stand out in the rain. Not a good choice for me.I think i wll just eat a lot more veggies."
3,Complete Spanish Verbbs,"This is not the verb conjugation book I use most. BUT, if 501 Spanish Verbs does not have the word I am looking for, which is rare, this one probably will since there are more than 4000 verbs. Using this book is more difficult. It has certain words completely conjugated and then a list of other verbs conjugated in the same manner. Takes time to get use to looking something up."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I bought this system for my son. Less than 3 months after first using it, the tuner failed. Sony gives you a one year warranty on the product. So, while disappointed, I figured ""no big deal"" - I'm covered for parts and labor for one year.What they don't tell you is that the ONLY place to repair the item under warranty is in Laredo, Texas, which is fine I suppose.......if you live near Laredo. I live on the east coast, so my ""free"" warranty service would actually cost me the time and materials for shipping this relatively heavy item. This hardly makes sense to pay shipping that would cost about 25% of the item's value.The product itself worked OK up until it stopped working. It had good sound and lots of features.My advice - buy a similar unit from Panasonic. Their warranty actually covers repair as you would assume (i.e., they will allow you to bring it to a local authorized dealer). Sony has numerous authorized service centers, but they won't cover their shelf systems there!"
2,what a joke,"product was labeled 'like new', but it should have been labeled 'like crap' ... it wasn't even all there, missing the bass speaker, and it had discolorations all over it, rock band stickers on it, corners of speakers broken off, front grating for speakers caved in, looked like a 10 year old owned it....this guy has already stated it was 'a mistake', and doesn't even want the merchandise back [because it is not worth the price to ship] and yet i now have a complaint going through Amazon.com to get my money back, because he just kept stalling and flaking me off, even still... said he sent it to the wrong address even, once....never....EVER.... order something from this 'person'...what a joke.Update: received check for original amount, minus a $13 dollar 'Amazon.com transaction fee',...but at least it is resolved, finally... i intend to withdraw the complaint, just as soon as the check clears."
2,Be very gentle,"We had gotten this hamper as part of a set for our daughter's bedroom theme, and while after it's purchase and use the side strings that hold on to the wood frame came loose. It could be resewed, but never seemed to have time to do so!"
2,OK for limited use,"These cookie cutters are okay if you plan on making a small batch of cookies using the imprint. However, they'll quickly frustrate you on larger recipes; it takes too long to get a nicely shaped and imprinted cookie."
4,A good book to help you understand what these men went throu,"A story that helps you to understand a little better what are men went throught, and how badly they were treated when they arrived home. It is A graphic read, and at times, very disturbing. this is a book that I would recommend, HIGHLY!"
2,You get what you pay for. . .,"The quality of this DVD is pretty low, badly organized and appears to have been transferred to DVD from VHS.Talks about some superficial history and traditional practices in Judo, then shows a warm up and several techniques. Very little time is spent breaking down the throws."
5,An important book in the historiography of witchcraft,"Ginzburg's research on the benandanti was path-breaking when it first appeared in the 1960's. It has become a classic, a required read for any student of history who is interested in the topic of the early modern European witch hunts. Ginzburg reconstructs a narrative in which the notion of what it was to be a ""witch"" was fundamentally changed by the Friulian peasants' encounters with the Inquisition."
4,It's a nice mix,"OK, I will admit, this is not typical Isley Brothers. However, what we have here is a combination of two of the greatest sex music artist over the last 30 years- this album is still nice. The song Keep It Flowin' is a crooning cut that you and your lady can get close too and partcipate in, while u can jam in the club to Body Kiss and maybe bring the lady you with home. This CD is a sold 8.5 outta 10."
3,dissapointed,"I am an old school isley's fan. R.kelly wrote this whole album, I love r kelly but ron isley should sound like himself not r kelly. he is too old for that, but this album does have its moments"
5,The Isleys have done it once agian!,"Today during my lunch break, I rushed to Target to catch the Isley Brother's newest CD ""Body Kiss""...I can honestly say that I LOVE IT!!! I have been listening to it ALL DAY long... I am speechless...It is rare today that one finds such a dynamic CD, but of course I am talking about Original Playas...so it is to be expected...My favorite song on the CD next to ""What Would You Do?"" is ""Busted""...."
3,Where is the Oringal?,"I bet your wonderin' what the heck I mean by ""Original""....and what I mean is where is The Isley Brothers!This whole album is R.Kelly'd out....and if you didn't know that just look at the back of the CD cover and it has R.Kelly written(typed) all over it!I must admit that R.Kelly is an amazing producer but fans of the old school Isley's will be a bit dissappointed. Don't worry though this album is pretty solid even if R.Kelly did most of the stuff for this album.If you are a big fan of the R. and Isley's than this album will blow your mind. Tracks like ""Body Kiss"" and ""Lucky Charm"" should be blazin' the radio soon.This album is also short.....I agree ""Where is the Rest of it?"" If the Isley's wanna continue making and selling music than drop the R. and do some of their own stuff.....I mean they really do have the talent to do so.....well that's my 2 cents! Peace!"
2,Where's Ernie????,"When I bought ""Body Kiss"", I was excited just by thecover. Ernie was all over the jacket. I was hoping thatthis was going to be as good as ""Eternal"". Boy wasI disappointed. Ernie is one the best guitarists aroundand without his contributions (which was enourmous onEternal), the songs sound like they are neutered. Onestinking song with an Ernie solo and it was over beforeI could get a groove on. I saw the Isley Brother's in1980 and am going to see them at the Turning Stone Casinoon October 4th in upstate New York. I hope they don'tplay too much from this CD...A real snoozer and disappointment."
1,R. KELLY KILLS THE ISLEY'S!!!,"there r some things that can b 4given n life.....this is not one of them. the pied piper of r&b(or so he would like u 2 think) has put his very grade school lyrics on every single track of this new isley album. it is an absolute shame 2 hear ronnie singing about his 20"" rims and what not. even worse than that, ernie isley poses with his guitar, but does not even use it but on one 30 second solo.....ON THE ENTIRE ALBUM!!! r.kelly has succeded in not using one of the greatest guitar players n the history of music. putting him on the sideline? however, with the state music is n now, there is probably a market 4 this junk. hopefully, real soon, someone will wake up and write real lyrics and play some real instruments....i can hope, can't i?"
3,does r mkelly have to be on here,this sounds more like r kelly than mr. big it seems that old ron is trying really hard to cash in these days.
2,Will the REAL Ron Isley Stand Up?,"Ok Ok. By now, we know that Ron Isley is like 70 years old trying to pretend that he's a 20 year old gangsta. We also know that he has written and performed some classic songs that will be around for many years to come. But this album is nothing more but a R.Kelly release. Not that its a bad thing, but when I buy an Isley cd I want their classic style and not R.Kelly's.Also the Mr. Biggs image is getting old and corny. I wish that Ron Isley will grow old gracefully (don't get me wrong, the man looks GOOD). This cd is not at his best. Remember Ronnie, ""at your best you are love"""
4,Body Kiss is Excellent!,"BODY KISS just goes to show that Ron Isley can hang with the new burgeoning R&B stars easily. Ron Isley sounds so smooth against R. Kelly's sensual arrangement. It is almost a collaboration built in heaven. This biggest surprise with BODY KISS is that Ron Isley, Mr. BIGGS is so edgy. The latter half of the album does lose some of the excitement that the first half had, but with albums today that seems to be the case most of the time. Track Picks: ""SUPERSTAR"", ""LUCKY CHARM"", ""WHAT WOULD YOU DO"", ""BODY KISS"", ""BUSTED"", and ""SHOWDOWN"". 4 stars MR. BIGGS!!!!"
3,Average performance,Does not keep beverages as hot as long as I expected. Good for maybe 2-3 hrs tops. OK for relatively brief periods of time.
3,Good but not Great!,"The capacity of this coffee carafe is great, but the coffee doesn't stay hot for more than 4 hrs.just warm.There is a problem getting all of the liquid out of the carafe. The rim design on the inside keeps a tablespoon or so from washing out. I have to give it a good shake to get all of the liquid out.Other than that I'm happy with this product."
5,WHAT A GREAT DEAL & GREAT LOOK.,I purchased two. These will be used on my serving table to serve regular and decafe coffee. They are sophisticated looking and the price is amazing. I looked for some at MY speciality kitchen store and they wanted a fortune for crafes that weren't as large.
2,Might be good for iced coffee,We are returning ours to the retail store where we bought it. Coffee is lukewarm after just a couple of hours. We also noticed the dribbling on pouring.
1,Just to let you know.,"This carafe is heavy, drips after pouring. Even after pre warming it didn't keep coffee warm.I have sent it back. I would like to say that Amazon, is the best on returns. I just put it back in the box, and l left it at my door."
1,"Does not do the job, luke warm coffee after 4 hours",I got this based on the other reviews but I have to say it was a big disappointment. Coffee is barely warm after only four hours so we end up microwaving it. Will probably put this one away and only use when we have company over and are serving a quantity of coffee. Regret making the purchase.
1,Heat retention,I use for coffee and the coffee cools down quite a bit after 2 hours. I tried the instructions to preheat the pot with hot water but with the same effect. My previous carafe before the bottom fell off was a Cuisinart which kept the coffee hot for 7 hours. So I'll donate this Copco to a charity and try a different carafe!!!
2,Disappointed,This pot is not a thermos and does not retain heat as long as I had hoped. I was also looking for the lid control opener. That is just what I wanted.
3,Hits and Misses,"McCammon has a rich imagination whose talent is commensurate with King, Koontz and other contemporaries. Unfortunately there were only a few entries in this collection that were entertaining and of quality. The novella ""Blue World"" that takes up half the space was a bit slow and too sweet for my taste. The standout stories were ""Nightcrawlers"" because anything with a Vietnam vet that was the victim of an Agent Orange-type chemical is worth it. ""Night Calls the Green Falcon"" is cool nostalgia and ""Yellowjacket Summer"" read like a collaboration with Stephen King. ""He'll Come Knocking at Your Door"" took some inspiration from Jackson's ""The Lottery"". ""Something Passed By"" was the most inventive where McCammon creates an overwhelming post-apocalyptic world demonstrating his vivid imagination."
5,I Scream Man !,"If you have ever read a book and wanted to actually visualize the scenes taking place on your mind's movie screen - then read anything by Mr. McCammon. This is an exceptonal book. It will remind you of the more twisted endings from Twilight Zone shorts and the more visceral scenes from OUter Limits episodes. The subtlety of his writing in some places and the out-and-out shock value doesn't you the warm fuzzies. You will actually feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up after reading ""Doom City"" & ""I Scream Man"" and your skin will tingle after ""Yellowjacket Summer.""Happy reading. Just do it with the lights dim...and at night. You'll weird yourself out."
1,Poor,I don't understand why so many people think this is a good book. I can only describe it as diet decaffeinated Stephen King ultra-light. Just didn't do it for me.Thanks for reading.
3,"Nice bag, bad strap","The bag is nice, with two insulated bottle holders and the cover doubles as a changing pad. There are a few zippered pockets. It is bulky, though, and the strap loosens on its own. I can't figure out a good way to attach it to the stroller, so it just kind of hangs there. I recommend getting a different bag that attaches well to the handlebar."
3,Nice but...,"The bag is nice, buuuuut:- It's not very clear that you have to purchase the bag and, BESIDES, the fleece lap cover (wich come in different colors), so, I recived my diaper bag with no exterior cover and had to talk with a person from pampered bags for purchase it. The sales person was extremely profesional and nice, but it was annoying to have to pay more and wait another week (or so) for the lap cover. The salesperson accepted this frecuently happens 'cause is not well explained in amazon.- By the way, it hardly fits under the bugaboo cameleon seat!! So, if you're lookingo for a diaper bag that goes with the stroller, it works. But not it not fits easy in the under basket if it has stuff in it. Have that in mind- The fleece lap doesn't exist in all the colors the seats covers come! I wanted it in orange and they don't make itHope this help you to avoid deceptions or surprises."
1,sales and marketing for janitorial service business,worst how to book i've ever seen. if you do not already know whats in this book you should not go into any business including janitorial. the book is so elimitary it provides no insight to the industry or how to navagate within the janitorial field. spend your money on a good mop not the book.
2,Never grabbed me,"That DeSalvo isn't the strangler, is not hard to swallow. But that senators and police commissioners and mayors conspire to keep it a secret, chokes the reader."
5,Christmas rocks on!,"From the first note to the last, this CD revives Christmas like no other! (Well, except for volume 1) If you like ANY artist on Happy Christmas vol. 2, BUY it! you'll love at least half of it and you'll want to play it year-round!"
4,The history of the past and the future!,"Since reading stories about Captain April and briefly viewing captains Pike, Decker, Harriman, and Garrett, I have wanted to know more about them. ""Enterprise Logs"" does not disappoint. The tales of Decker and Harriman (especially the latter) were the most enjoyable (5 stars). Garrett's story was close behind. And, although I read little non-fiction, I found the based-on-fact stories on captains Dickenson and Hardison to be entertaining and exciting (4 stars). I found the stories of Kirk and Picard, the ones of whom we are most knowledgeable, to be weakest yet worthy of reading. I am not a fan of the ""Captains' Table"" books as I find it difficult to imagine Picard telling war stories, even to his equals; still, the story was very good (3 1/2 stars). Read it and enjoy the history of the past and the future!"
5,Wonderful Missing Moments!,"If for no other reason, this book introduces us to Captains we don't know enough about such as Harriman and Garrett. Plus a wonderful story of Spock commanding during the Academy revealing the beginning of his relationship with Saavik culminating in ""Vulcan's Heart"". And even the few moments when Decker commanded the Enterprise."
1,Has a long way to go,"This CD is very generic in sound and origionality. Nadia still has a long way to go to develop her voice,and style. You are better off buying the compilation CD series which contain all the tracks from the other more talented members of the Mexican reality show ""La Academia"""
1,Not good...,"I regeret buying this album, this girl has a nice voice, but that's all, her music is very commercial, there's nothing original in her voice or the lyrics, the songs don't express much, it's simple, plain, and predictable."
4,A Very Nice Backpack for the price,"This is a really nice little backpack. Weighs nothing on its own, does not get stained or pick up lint, pockets are just the right size and the zippers work, and it is comfortable to wear. It is well made. The only bad thing about it is that it has no internal structure of its own, so it really hangs down on your fanny when loaded with heavy lumpy things, such as kid snacks and coffee cups. This in turn makes your shirts and jackets creep up your back. If I remember to put in a light notebook or big square eva puzzle for the kids, it's more comfortable. You might just want to find a lightweight piece of foam to fit up against your back. Other than that, perfect! This was half the price and 1/4 of the weight of the other ones I looked at."
4,"Versatile, Lightweight, Functional, and Roomer than You'd Expect","I can echo the comments made by the other reviewers, except that I didn't have any problems with the threads near the zipper unraveling. The only thing I would add would be a recommendation to NOT order this bag in black--although the fabric is super-soft and comfy, it did pick up lots of lint during a recent trip. And it seems to act as a cat hair magnet! I also had a little bit of a problem with the mesh side pockets; the drawstrings (like the shoulder straps) seemed to loosen over time and I lost a couple of water bottles. Other than that, it's great bag for travel and everyday use, and the price is reasonable."
1,"was a five, now a one","The Civita daypack I bought five years ago was perfect. Alas, it was stolen. For some reason the manufacturer changed the design. The material is different; the size is smaller; and, most importantly, with the new design, the zippers on the main compartment catch routinely and dislodge themselves. I repaired the zippers once at a cost almost equal to the price of the bag. Each time I would use the bag I would have to zip it up with extreme care and a feeling of trepidation. Finally, this morning I threw the horrid thing away."
1,Zipper problems,"As has been reported, the latest version of this light, perfect-size city day bag suffers from poor zippers. They routinely get caught in the small cloth flap that hides them. Now, my 2 month-old bag has non-working zippers, and I don't want to spend more money to get them repaired. It's too bad, because this bag was ideal for carrying my netbook and assorted papers I use for work. My only other minor complaint is that the shoulder strap was too narrow, and caused an uncomfortable strain on my neck. I purchased a new, heavy-duty, padded, wider shoulder strap, and that customization gave me what I believed to be the perfect day bag. Now, I'm looking for something similar, but by a different manufacturer."
3,Decent Bag,"I used this bag daily for about 3 weeks when traveling through Japan and here is my evaluation:PROS: Well done, big enough for your daily materials, quite light, good fit even for tall people (even though when I received it I was worried that straps are not long enough, I am over 6'5').CONS: Biggest issue I have is that it is not waterproof so in hot weather when you are sweating a lot, all paper materials that are not in sheet protectors could get wet and disintegrated. It happened to me few times. Second issue is that the main zipper very often bites into the textile zip protector, and thus gets stuck. Not a real problem, but annoyance at least.Overall, decent choice if you need something small and light and do not use it in hot or too rainy climates."
5,Hal Leonanard Country Guitar Method,"Great Material, written so anyone can understand it. Improved my plaing the very first time I opened the book. Thanks"
3,A book for complete novices,"This book takes you from the most simplest of ideas and licks to some more complex ones, but did not go as in depth as I wanted it to. A lot of the example licks at the beginning I found to be very bland, actually some were horrible, but as he introduced more concepts like hammer ons and pulloffs(yes he explains some things that are this basic) some better riffs started popping up.I thought there was gonna be full transcriptions of chattahoochee and ring of fire. I was wrong. this book did not go into detail about the more complex techniques I was looking for, and the song transcriptions seemed very ""bare bones"". There are some good licks, and some cool concepts introduced, but it was not enough of what I was loofing for, IMO, Don't pick this one up, especially if you've been playing guitar for more than a year."
5,Simple and to the point,"I got this book because my 3 year old had just started pre school and was having trouble adjusting. He started acting out at school and would complain of missing us (me, dad, grandma) all day long. So I got this book and ""When I feel Angry"". We read them everyday for a week, along with alot of one on one talks and special time. I must say that his behavior improved drastically after that week.I like that the book is simple and the characters are cute animals so that children of every race can identify with."
1,Don't recommend,"As a therapist I was supremely disappointed with this book. It wasn't a story, but rather statements that are too easily made and dismissed. I would not recommend this book or this author. Far more excellent books on the market."
5,maestro,"Mr. Pratt's interpretation of Bach, Brahms and Mussorgsky is unparalleled. He is a master at what he does. Those who have not experienced his performing should, and those who have already, should again. The subtle and intimate way he performs delights the senses and moves the soul."
5,Pratt does it right,This is one of those CD's you will keep in your collection. It is excellent he does a wonderful job with the material. The definitive touch on some important pieces.
1,Try again,"If you're seeking classical, you should probably stick with those known for their musical abilities/merits, and there are many choices that would supercede recordings such as this. Mr. Pratt has quite a way to go."
5,What ever happened ...,"What ever happened to the Hansons, or whatever their names were? For those of you who don't know about them they were a father and son team that always made lame impossible predictions for WWE PPV's about matches that had no chance of happening. However, they are most notable for their constant jabbering about getting pizza and watching the shows.If you Hansons are out there ... we all miss your pointless reviews. Please come back."
3,A little beat up and pages falling out,The cover was pretty bent up and a section of over 10 pages is beginning to fall out. Better than paying twice as much for a new one though. Got here pretty quickly.
1,THIS IS NOT DUMBO!!!,"This is NOT dumbo, yes it is an elephant and yes it is Disney but it is LUMPY from Winnie the Pooh. It is NOT DUMBO!!!!"
4,Food and Drink of Mexico is a great collection of receipes.,Booth has chosen representative receipes from all over Mexico. They are easy to follow and prepare. I'm buying another copy to replace the one I lost. Buen Provecho.
5,This DVD has it all,"Even though this was made in 1990, interval training is the best way to train. The fact that it's on the beach with the waves roaring is great. Beautiful setting. I love everything about this DVD and I think Gilad is a great trainer. I pretend I'm on a fitness vacation when I do this workout."
3,Geared for men but ok for women,"It doesn't state in the description but this workout is designed for men! Imagine my surprise to find I was doing a men's workout! But quite honestly--it is fine for women. It is basically the same types of moves he does in his other workouts. I love Gilad but his repoirtoire of moves is limited. Seems to be a very similar workout most of the time...anyway-just an fyi that it is designed for men. If you like Gilad-you will probably like the workout although-it is actually pretty easy for a men's workout, unless you are a beginner."
5,Gilad doesn't get enough praise,"This DVD was so, so good. He really is a great talent and knowledgeable. I highly reccomend if you want to focus on ""summer abs"" as I call them. Can't ever go wrong with Gilad."
1,Clarify theTitle!,This DVD should be relabelled INTERVAL TRAINING FOR MEN.It's called Interval Training which is misleading as I thought it was a workout for women. It's not!
1,Don't Get BURNED!,"From here on out, I am reading all Amazon reviews as they help with customer satisfaction. This is the SAME program as Get Moving! Walking for Weight Loss as well as Cardio Walk for Weight Loss. Apparently Gaiam thought they could sell the same thing three times. Well at least I was only fool enough to buy it twice. It is a good workout overall & I am giving one copy to my friend."
1,This is Get Moving: Walking for Weight Loss with a new title!,"Don't be fooled. This isn't a new workout, it was previously released as Get Moving: Walking for Weight Loss. It is a great workout, one of my favorites, but if you own the other DVD you already own a copy."
2,Could have been better.,When we opened the package we had to scramble to figure out how to attach the top. The screw holes were stripped and the screws were missing. Not that great of a deal.
1,Disappointing,"Purchased this for my 13 year old daughter. Has been wobbly from the first day. The hinges on the top have come off. Like the way it looks, but don't like the quality."
2,Flimsy,Screws were falling out when I received this! Hope you have lots of wood glue if you buy this...
4,Value Driven Management,This book spells out the concepts of Value Driven Management. Chapter 7 does well with giving the reader a mindset on how to approach the concept. The book on a whole is a great piece of marketing for Dean Pohlman and his cohorts. You'll find that he refers to them often within the text. Good Book.
4,Good book but bit outdated,"This is a good introductory book on game theory. It has good examples and exercises. But I felt that it is a bit out dated and does not cover many topics that has become important in the last decade. Infact, repeated prisoner dilemma is one of the advanced topics in the book even though it is a topic covered in first month in any contemporary game theory course. That said, I still believe that it is well written and is useful as a good intro to undergrads."
2,traduzione datatissima...,"non certo la più aggiornata delle traduzioni. Linguaggio e costruzione aulica, che fa perdere un po' il piacere della lettura di questo magnifico testo. cercate qualche versione più recente..."
4,This item sucks (in the good way)!,"This is the first dust collector I have purchased, so my opinion may be of little value. However I hooked this up to my table saw, band saw, router table and 13"" plainer and this baby worked like a charm. I can actually see the dust and wood chips being pulled down into the tool and into the dust collector. No more sweeping wood chips off of the floor.The dust collector was easy to set-up, just a few bolts to mount the wheels, the motor housing and the bag attachment. Holding the plastic bag in place while trying to get the band on is a little tricky. I used a couple pieces of duct tape to hold it on while I placed the band clamp on. The small clips on the unit do not work well with the plastic bag.For a 115V machine this unit is powerful. I didn't want to rewire my shop for 220V, so this unit works great."
3,Arrived Slightly Bent.,"The frame that holds the motor arrived slightly bent from shipping, but was easily fix with a pair of pliers.Instead of using two supports to hold up the filter bag they should have used three for better stability. The bag is a bit wobbly.It seems like typical quality and construction that you get from imports these days and only rates as an average product, hence three stars."
1,Low quality,Mine came with a defective motor that drew 70amps on startup before the 20amp breaker tripped.The collector is made of the cheapest steel I have ever seen. The strength is similar to lead.The bolts are cheapest stamped junk I have ever seen.Very flemsey once assembled.Amazon took mine back at no cost to me. Don't waist your time.
1,EMBARRASSING!,"I would hate to see what OZZY would do to these bands if he ever heard this disgusting attempt to imitate what have become some of the greatest songs ever written! Haven't you people seen what he does to doves? When these songs were written,I'm sure that OZZY intended for the words to be understood. With the exception of Mr. Crowley; which is only ok; two words come to mind: FIRING SQUAD!Sincerely, Nitemare"
1,Dont wast your money!,"I concur. The music on this CD is an embarrasment to Ozzy Osbourne's legacy. I could not find one song that I liked. The only people that may like this CD are those that are into alternative, punk and funk trash metal. As for myself, I just like good old rock and roll."
1,New Metal Bands Screwed Up Classic Music,"This stuff is terrible. These bands murdered Ozzy's classic tunes. The only real song that comes close to matching the intensity of the original is Ion Storms version of Mr. Crowley, all the others are nu metal type stuff, and it ruined the songs. In another review someone said that these were true metal bands...not at all. THIS IS NU METAL, NU METAL SUX, NU METAL BANDS RUIN OLD TUNES!!!! Real metal bands are Slayer, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Pantera, and the best of all...The Ozzman himself. Stick to the original Ozzy stuff and not tribute albums- they usually suck"
1,matt,"This dosen't even deserve one star for the rating. Its almost as if the people who made this album were making fun of ozzy, rather than trying to make a tribute. I firmly believe anyone who gives this album a good review MUST have either helped put the album together, or are related to someone who did. If you like ozzy's sound, you will not find any of it in this. It almost sounds like the person on the first few tracks only growls into the mic, staying on the same note through out the song. if ozzy heard this, i'm sure he'd be horribly apauled. Hopefully the musicians in this album never attempt another recording."
4,Death metal tribute album!!! Haters beware. Album is brutal!,"First, I'd like to tell all of the people who don't like ""growl"" vocals that if you're going to judge the album solely on that lame excuse, then bury your head up your ass. Dwell Records tribute albums are for mostly DEATH METAL BANDS paying tribute to their idols who helped bring about the genre through their founding style, heavy metal.If you don't appreciate death metal, by all means, go back home to Mommy and crank your lame ass sissy metal. Why would I want to hear a band that sounds like Ozzy play OZZY songs?!?!? That's lame and unoriginal.How about hearing modern metal bands taking their idols' songs that they grew up with and helped forge their musical careers and cranking them up 12 notches??? Hell yeah, that's what I want to hear!Bottom line....if you don't like death metal vocals, pass on Dwell Record compilations. If you wanna hear amped up, hellified versions of old metal songs, grab these comps."
3,Not that bad..,Totally worth the $... I paid for it.:) It's always nice to see what artists can do with each others music and this is a shining example of what happens when true metal bands get to grinding on some old classics. Basically if you like Ozzy then youll like this.
3,Series slips a bit here.,"Kaori Ozaki, Immortal Rain, vol. 4 (Tokyopop, 2002)The time of Yuca's birth is nigh, and both contingents have made it to the underground installation where the angels were created during the last world war--Calvaria to plunder the technology, and Rain to face his nemesis once again. Of course, even though these two goals are entirely separate, that's not to say they're not going to collide in the ugliest of ways. Immortal Rain is still a good series, but it's starting to fragment. Hopefully Ozaki can pull things together in volume 5. ***"
2,Where&#65533;s the how to,"More of a where to buy than a how to, there some info on what is available, and some suggestions on what engine are being used and how they fit but no real detail on how to convert to aircraft use. So all in all a bit disappointing"
3,How much is your life worth?,"Unlike a car that can be pulled over to the side of the road on engine failure,in an aircraft it means one thing at least, you are going down! And fuel injection? Besides all of the ""must work"" electronics, if a fuel line fails at 40+ psi it is going to spray high pressure mist all over that hot engine. Now you are burning while going down. No, I would rather convert an old GPU and rebuild it myself than use a brand new automotive engine. But the book was interesting and a must read if you are really sold on this idea."
3,"Great Guide, Wretched Maps","A hiker in the Pisgah Forest for over 40 years, I was delighted to find many new destinations and great campsites in this guide that I had never known about. This is a unique resource that makes the marvels of Pisgah - one of the secret gems of the eastern US - accessible to many folks for the first time. The maps, however, are something else again. I'm a professional cartographer, and I can confidently say I've NEVER encountered worse trail maps. To be able to use this guidebook at all I took all the authors' maps and recreated them in a more intelligible form. It's a shame to see a very good guidebook spoiled by a complete lack of appreciation of good mapmaking practice."
5,Great Hikes,"This book details some wonderful hikes in the North Carolina mountains. Experienced hikers and casual strollers alike will find ample adventures mapped out in this excellent book. The authors, all natives of NC, have certainly put much time and energy into creating a book that would reflect their love of the outdoors and their special fondness for the western section of NC. I highly recommend this guide. Enjoy!"
2,Not worth a five star rating,I think that the other reviews on this book are a little over inflated. Pros on this guide: good trail descriptions and the GPS coordinates are a definite plus (although not all the hikes in book include GPS coordinates).Cons: 1)- Numbering the hikes and giving them a quality rating would be nice (1 to 5 stars). 2)- Putting a key map with their hike number at the front of the book would greatly speed up the process of figuring out where the trails are. I am not from NC and it took me quite a bit of time to figure out where on my trails illustrated map the hikes in this book were located.
3,Not as good as others,"I wish the guide included more information about what was special about the trails - plants, wildlife, geology, views, etc to be able to chose the best trails for me (rather than a litany of mountains viewable on the compass rose). The maps need to be improved or left out. I would have liked trail elevation profiles."
2,Cumbersome and dull,"Not the best organized hiking book. Almost too much information at times... I've flipped through it, but overall it wasn't really worth the expense. There are better hiking list books out there."
5,Great baking and bowl set,I needed to order a set of these items because I had a set for a long time but over the years I broke alot of the pieces. So now I have a new set that my husband told me I am not allowed to touch for fear of me dropping them!
3,Kindle Edition for laptop app review w/ammendment,"An excellent and informative book of a series that I grew to love later in life. However, if it were not for the uniqueness of that information, especially the episode guide, I would most likely delete the Kindle version I purchased for running on my MacBook Pro (with the Kindle app). Pages sometimes jump backwards, or not page forward, then leap two pages. Tried reloading from archives as directed but no change. I have several other Kindle books for laptop that run extremely well so this is frustrating. It's a pity because the book is fascinating.Amendment as of April 25,2011: I heard from Amazon/Kindle Customer Service today that a new file of this excellent book was available for downloading from the Archives. I deleted the old file again, downloaded again, and... it works!! No more erratic paging. I am very pleased. I can now, without reservations, give it 5 stars."
4,Not another run-of-the-mill Western series book,"This is not just another Western series picture book. It is full of behind the scenes information including interviews with many of the stars of the show as well as extensive insight by producer Frank Price. Anyone who has ever wondered if the Virginian was given a name in the series will have that question answered as well as other inside information on why certain actors were chosen for the roles and the process of putting episodes together from writing to wrap up. Recommended as a more ""technical"" book on THE VIRGINIAN television series."
3,Not Complete,"This book started out well. VB6 is introduced in a methodical but interesting format. And then it just shoots off into the authors' ""let me tell you about my favorite program"" stories. The programs and the commentary are too specific. If you want to get a start on making a screen saver application then this is a good palce to start but applying the material is not placed in the larger context of a more academic and/or useful setting. On the other hand, it is a good marketing idea for Sybex - take a bunch of lengthy books that are questionable in their own right and make an anthology that claims to be complete. It worked once but not again. Customer lost to the competition."
4,Very good for beginners,As I bought this book I tough that it should include complete coverage of VB but it does not. This is a perfect book for a beginners but it only covers a basics of VB programming. It does not cover database programming !!!! There is almost nothing of database programming. This is very good book for beginners (and cheap)!
5,A lot of Info for the Price,"I've been away from vb for about six months and wanted to find a book to brush up on the subject. This was excellent for that purpose. The only problem I had was that the editing is a little weak. For instance, a variable will be declared but used with a different name in the subsequent code - things like that. If you think there is an obvious mistake, just quit dwelling on it and push on. There are numerous small mistakes that will drive you crazy if you are a perfectionist. If you can live with imperfection :), you will benefit from this book."
3,Upbeat romance we all wished had happened at some time...,"I liked the story of Angela and Jeff from a romantic fairytale point of view. She's in love with him, he's in love with another woman and rejects her, realizes he's wrong and comes back to make her his woman. Enough to make you swoon. She gets to play hard to get and an angel in that she has taken on the job of raising her dead friend's child.This is easy reading in which you know the outcome and none of this is a bad thing. It's got enough hot sex without becoming repetitive and boring.I like a good romance with somewhat of a storyline then I don't feel so decadent and this fits the bill. The writing, for the most part, is well done and that helps."
3,Slightly less than lustrous,"My stone was, true to tell, quite a bit duller than pictured. In all, however, a very good value."
3,custom tax,The ring was of excellent quality and prefect fit.I had to pay custom tax which I was not aware of.The custom tax was a let down.
2,I've read better,"This book starts off really good, but then it just becomes very repetitive. Every chapter Scott tries to get Ryan to have sex with him again. Ryan says no, but then ends up caving and they screw. And after a while it's just the same crap over and over again."
2,Could have used an editor,"There's plenty of raw energy here, and this would have made a good 50-100 page novella. Alas, it's 350 pages long! The astonishingly randy protagonists make love three or four times a day, and we hear about it every time, along with what they have for breakfast, how they get dressed (and undressed), etc., etc., etc. The style can be most charitably described as pedestrian. Sample sentence: ""They quickly put the dishes in the dishwasher and zoomed to the theater in Scott's vehicle"". And the book (self-published) is full of errors of grammar and spelling. Annoyingly, this is really just the first half of a book: several themes are introduced (coming out to family and classmates, the homophobic Joe) which apparently get resolved in the so-called sequel, which is really the second half of this book. Maybe I'm just an old grouch.... late teen readers may enjoy this book (and quite a few did, judging from the reviews), but you can do better elsewhere."
1,dialogue dialogue dialogue,"If you're into reading page upon page upon page upon page of nothing but dialogue...party on. But 5 stars, come on people!"
5,Oh My God !,"I just finished this story and had to review it. This is one of the best books I've ever read. I'm Ryan's age (in the novel, of course) and can totally identify with his angst. You don't know how many times I cried while I read! Scott is the best boyfriend. I wish I knew someone like him. Maybe I will some day. I can't say enough good things about this story, but if you read it, you'll know why I'm keeping it on my nightstand for awhile. I'm getting the sequel ""Into This World We're Thrown"" today."
4,great!,The best romance novel i have ever read. You can feel the conection they share and the world is very detailed and draw you in.
2,I Can't Find it ( No lo encuentro...),"I Bought this one 'cause i saw on YouTube the extended version of ""Tu necesitas and 70's Medley""...I was dissapointed when i received this one and it's edited...I like all Aleks Syntek's Music, but i was expecting this one...2 Stars.Compré este DVD esperando encontrar el Popurri de los 70's y Tu necesitas, que lo ví por YouTUbe, midecepción fué que no aparece el medley, solo la cancion, parece que la han editado...Me gusta toda la música de Aleks, pero estaba esperando particularmente el popurri...Por eso le pongo sólo 2 estrellas."
2,"awful , plasticy sound on trebles, not clear ( like La Bella or Augustine)","awful sounding strings, I have a professional quality classical guitar, and have used Augustine for years. So I wanted to try these ( the steel acoustic guitar strings are fine ), and the treble strings have a really plastic sound to them.My guitar, with high tension strings, usually has a nice clear bell-like ringing tone. With these, the guitar sounds more like a folk guitar -- or like I'm using a plastic pick and not my sanded fingernails -- there's a definite change in timbre. Willy nelson's guitar has the same plastic tone to it. Yuck...for classicalNever again... will I buy these classical guitar strings.And yes, I do prep my fingernails with sandpaper , to get a smooth tone."
3,Decent Palmer,"This is a decent story, while I liked both of the characters well enough, it just wasn't great. It started off good, then started lagging, but towards the end it picked up some more. I can't say much bad about it and I can't say anything too good about either, just an average read that some may like more than others. Still there's some cute stuff nearer the end and it's a fine lil read. :)"
2,Avoid Nordic Scone Pan,"I ordered two Nordic Ware mini-scone pans. Both arrived with blistered surfaces that flaked away leaving exposed areas. Whether the pans are safe to use this way or not, Nordic Ware quality reviewers should be more attentive. I will probably never use the pans or purchase additional Nordic Ware if I can't see the product beforehand."
4,Cornbread pan,I wanted a small pan to cook cornbread or polenta in. I have a small counter-top toaster oven and I wanted a pan small enough to fit in it. It works fine and gives a nice crispy edge to the cornbread.
1,Horribly Written with a lot of factual mistakes.,I reported not only on this story but some of the other Jordan cases mentioned in this book. The author got alot of the facts wrong and I mean alot of facts are wrong. Some of the things written about didn't even happen. The photographs were horrible and looked like they were taken with a poloraid. It doesn't surprise me that the girls lawyer liked it because it is nothing more than a tribute to the lawyers and those poor poor girls who were tracked down by those mean old police just because they killed a couple of people who were old any way. I can't believe this got published. Whatever publisher put this out really hurt their reputation
1,This book is too confusing,"My wife is the big true crime reader. I read mainly fiction. And since this crime happened about 30 miles from where we live I thought I would surprise her and give her this book. She handed it back to me the next day and told me it wasn't any good. She told me to read it and I would know why. She was right. This book was very confusing, in that it jumped around a lot. I found myself having to look back through the chapters to keep up with who was who. I had hoped the author would have gone into the psychology of the criminals, but he kept to the surface material which was a little more than found in the newspapers. Like the other people who gave their reviews, I would not recommend this book as a good true crime book. I guess I've learned my lesson. It's best to stick with writers that you know something about."
3,Hey it's a frying pan,"This isn't as nice as it is cracked up to be. Kind of on the cheesy crappy side. It's ok but would never sell for the inflated price that they advertise. But then again, how exciting can a frying pan be?? (If you have an answer for that... you need to get out more often!!)"
3,Fly fishing northern NM,"Good descriptions, nice details, maps could have been a little more inclusive."
2,"a little good, alot of bad...","well, i thought this album would be great and have alot of scratching and cuting......but in fact the mixing is few and far between...the boot camp track is good, but all in all it is average at best.."
1,Little to no info on Fiat 124 or 2000.,"Chiltons usually writes a good manual, for American cars anyway. When it comes to Italian cars they don't know what is going on. This book is a real disappointment. There is no useful info on the 124 or 2000 Spiders, except for tune up guides. If you want a real repair manual check out International Auto Parts. They have helped me a great deal in restoring my '79 - 2000."
3,Ok.,The side panles don't lay flat like the back and front. The left side doesn't fit correctly per the layout of the escape. The price was good.
1,Stinks,"It wont read anything. They dont help me fix it. It doesnt work with NERO. Even with XP, my computer freezes up and stops working, which it didnt do before. Im not even making any of this up."
4,Romantico Desde SIEMPRE!,"Romantico Desde siempre is a CD by Luis Miguel. The title means basically that he's been a romantic since he was a child. Luis Miguel started his career when he was 11 years old (most fans know this) and of course we all know that boys go trough a thing called a voice change. Even with all of that going on this CD is great, I love it! It's got you hopping around one second and almost crying the next. By the way if you do look at the picture in the cover you can tell by the shadow of the haircut that the picture was taken when he was a teenager not a grown man."
4,Very Entertaining,"I think that for a young boy, Luis Miguel really knew what he was doing when he was singing these songs. This CD was just somewhat the beginning of Mickys career and you could tell just how big and successful he would become."
2,Dissappointed,"If you're looking for Luis, this is not the cd. It is his music, but he's not singing it. Stay away from this unless you don't care for his voice. I really don't even know who all was singing."
5,Dawson Makes You Get Off Your Duff...,"... and get out to the mountains he loves.He was the first person in history to ski down all of Colorado's fourteeners. He's climbed all at least once and many several times. Among his accomplishments are four ascents up the Diamond face of Longs Peak, so it is no surprise that Longs Peak figures prominently in this text. Dawson began climbing at an early age, and has written several other guide books for hikers in Colorado. His illustrations are excellent, and his narratives are brief enough to keep your interest and meaty enough to provide the information most are looking for."
2,Instructors Guide to Fiber Optics Technicians Manual,"This is the second edition by Jim Hayes an instructor with Fiber U of ""Instructors Guide to Fiber Optics Technicians Manual"" WARNING You need the ""other"" manual issued in Feb 2000, not this one issued in March 2002 for the full 17 chapter overview!"
4,Great basic training,I bought this book mostly for the basic information as a review. The book has been very helpful when any questions surrounding color codes and signal strength are involved.
2,Good for beginners focusing on inside plant fiber,"This book is designed predominnantly for folks who will be working with Multimode fiber and predominantly inside plant. It lacks significantly when it comes to outside plant work and single mode fiber. This book was written by Mr. Hayes with the focus on his FOA CFOT structure training and that is again predominantly focused on mulitmode cable and field terminations, rather than single mode."
5,Great starter book!,"If your new to the business, or just want a refresher, who better than Jim Hayes to provide the material....he's the ""Old Man"" of the Fiber Optics field. This is a well-written manual that covers just about everything you need to know about fiber optics...history, nomenclature, splicing and terminating..it's all here. jtm"
5,excellent choice,i didn't like the organization of the book but the content is excellent.highly recommended.
5,Into Fiber Optics?,Purchased this book for my son who is continuing his education in Fiber Optics. This book is a wonderful companion as an aid in fiber certification. Well written with end of chapter quizzes.
2,"Good information, but redundant.","I purchased this book to assist in staff training. I have found it to contain useful information. However, after the first chapter, it tends to repeat itself without introducing much new helpful information. There are lots of checklists for staff self-evaluations that, when scored, do not include information on improving their weak areas. Also, as this book was written for the UK, I have found the language to be interesting, but a slight drawback. There is quite a bit of UK slang (such as tatty, taken out of a skip, put a tick in the appropriate column, etc.). And there was an interesting, but not so useful for the US, chapter on British Telecom."
4,Excellent,"I admire greatly the great works of Poe. He's magical in his own way. This book is mysterious and ""spooky"" yet a great treat for the mind."
5,Best Guide I've Seen,This guide does a great job of giving the information for which I was looking. Well laid out and easy to read.
3,Bradt Uganda,"Relatively up to date information although a few facts were off. Easy to read and well put together for a country that is not often specifically featured in books and has only started to invest in tourist endeavors. Reviews of hostels, hotels were accurate. More maps needed though. Overall helpful and complete - appreciated the historical sections."
5,A Nice Feeding Device for Cages with Small (standard) Doors,"I am a hobby finch breeder. I have the bird feeders with catch trays that can be mounted INSIDE a cage. They are nice for standard seed feeding. The problem with them though is that you have to reach inside the cage and remove to refill and then replace inside the cage again. :(These Penn Plax feeders are much more convenient if you have a small standard door you can install them in. Because they are installed OUTSIDE the cage (the bird hops into the open door that supports the feeder and feeds) they can be refilled quite easily without disturbing the bird(s). You just pop the top, pour the seed and go. You can also remove and empty the catch tray much more easily like this.Bottom line: LOVE THESE!! :)"
5,Viva Italiano!,When I make Spaghetti sauce I use this spice in my ground beef. It adds the perfect Italian touch to make the sauce so yummy!
3,Get it if you love great singing... not if you want great recording standards,"There isn't a great deal to say, only that you should get this if you want to hear great singing from three great artists in thier prime, particularly Caballe, but dont get it if you want high quality technical standards for the recording. This is live and is rough as guts. There is huge applause and a couple of little hicups musically (as is expected with a live performance).La Scala produced some of the most amazing performances during this period and this is one of them, its just a shame they didn't have the recording techniques we have now. Luisa Miller is a great opera, if it weren't for such works as Rigoletto, La Traviata, Otello, Falstaff etc. etc. this would be better know and more highly praised.I still recommend this set, even with its flaws, as it is some of the most glorious singing I have heard in a long time."
5,Destined to become a classic...a monumental work,"I read this book carefully in a span of 24 hours. Surely this book has ""legs"", by which I mean word of mouth alone may be enough to someday put this book on the required reading lists of schools of some future era. This 231 page memoir is as powerful and as riveting as the best of fiction. It certainly provides one with a deeper understanding of George Orwell's ""Animal Farm"". If it is possible to recommend this book more than I am doing, it is only because I do not know how, that I do not."
5,the brutality of Stalin's regime at the lowest level,"This book presents in detail the appalling way Stalin's brutal Communist regime treated everybody, right down to the level of poor peasant farmers, and how like everyone else they were harrassed, threatened and bullied to submit to Stalin's wishes ... and if they showed any resistance at all to Stalin's policies, practices and (invariably ignorant-thug) functionaries they were punished by forced labour - if they were lucky in the home area, if not in a concentration camp where their life expectancy was short.Much has been heard about Hitler's regime, but Stalin's was even worse. A must read!"
4,Great Cd Single,Part of my Drum 'n' Bass mix. Track three is excellent. Track four is more of a chillout track.
5,Melodic Drum n' bass at it's best,"Kosheen is a crew of three guys that make incredibly good Drum n'Bass, this single contains one of their best tunes, Hide U which is getting really popular in the northern hemisphere where I live, probably because it get's better everytime you listen to it. If you are interested in Drum n'bass or if you are a DJ, then check out their album, ""Empty skies"" and I promise you that you won't be disappointed."
1,This is NOT the best version of the song,It is a shame that the world finally knows this song from this dull version of Kosheen. The best version is and will always be for me the Star 69's Suzanne Palmers' which unfortunately has not been released yet outside the clubs. Look later this year for Suzanne Palmer's Hide U with remixes by Peter Rauhoffer.
5,Best feature is an EASY PLAY for young kids,"What I loved about this, besides the Veggie-Tales aspect, was it has an Easy Play button in Parental Controls for younger kids. This allows unlimited tries and help with the harder actions in the game. For example: there are deep pits Cuke must jump over. With Easy Play, the cumcumber just bounces out of them instead of losing a player.This is not only such a fun game, but great for sereral age groups and it does not just use the mouse, it uses buttons on the keyboard.The guys at Big Idea really did a good job on this."
2,"A funny man, but a not-so-funny album...","Kyle Cease is one of my favorite comedians of all time, which is why I rushed out to buy this CD. However, I was quite disappointed. I've watched him on Comedy Central several times, but this CD is not nearly as funny. The bonus DVD that comes along with it has its funny parts, but isn't as great as I thought it would be. Hence the 2 out of 5 stars."
3,DVD could've focused on his stand up...,"Kyle Cease's ""One Dimple"" is a good comedic performance that would be appreciated by 20 somethings. Children of the late eighties and early nineties would like his comedic style/delivery/topics. The CD focuses solely on his stand up routine. The DVD, for me, was the only disappointment in this package. It contains footage of a whirlwind tour that Cease went through last year. His comedy, focusing on sarcastic delivery, doesn't translate on the DVD as good as it does in his standup routine.Overall, Cease is one funny guy with funny topics and delivery that intelligent 20 somethings would appreciate."
4,Fast and furious,"First I want to mention that this book is available in audio from iambik auido books. The narrator is wonderful and will really draw you into the story and have you on the edge of your seat waiting to hear what happens next. I enjoy stories about young people and the emotional and other problems they go through and how they manage to get beyond them. Our young protagonist is plagued with problems and her step mother is frustrated dealing with her nailing things shut and roaming the house at night. Sounds spooky, and it is. For an intense experience and nail biting thrills listen to the audio version. Or get the hard copy. Either way you will enjoy this story and I think it is a good choice for Young Adult readers."
3,little package big shipping cost,"Shipping on this 2 oz. product was $6.50, wiping out the savings on the price of the product. At least I didn't have to shop for it."
2,"Creepy, smile-less expression not like photo","I bought this puppet for my child to accompany a Curious George book as gifts. The puppet I received is NOT smiling like the subtle smile in the photo, and the mouth line is actually flawed and slightly bent, giving the puppet a somewhat creepy expression. Immediately it reminded me of the famous ""Robert the haunted doll"", with this smile-less expression along with the blank eyes. It gives me the creeps to give this weird looking version of Curious George to my child, but since I don't have time to get another gift, this is what I'm stuck with. If you order this product, hopefully your puppet will be sewn a little better and will actually have a subtle smile."
4,Birthday gift,I bought this for our greatgrandson's first birthday. It was a big hit at the party. He AND the adults had fun with it.
5,FANTASTIC!!,"My son received this George when he was 6 months old and has carried him around NON-stop since. He has many frequent flier miles and is VERY entertaining when a parent is willing to engage in some imaginative stories!! My son is 4 now and this George is his best friend! Soft, sweet, and a classic!!"
2,Very disappointed w/Puppet,"Maybe I'm just confused, but I thought a puppet had a mouth that opened so that when you put your fingers in it, it appeared to be talking. That's what I expected, I wanted the puppet to entertain my 20 month old grandson on Skype. This is a stuffed toy, not a puppet!"
2,Not a real puppet,"I agree with the previous post. This is not a puppet, it is a nice stuffed animal with a hole in the back. It is very hard to get your hand in the back and when you do your finger do not go very far into the arms so all you can do is make his head nod and flap his arm around. As a puppet it moves more like a seal than a monkey. I had my husband try it also. He has much longer finger than I do, but still he could not get the arm to move much. By the end of the first day the stiching was ripping at the seam were you put your hand in. When I repair the side I am going to stich up the back and just turn it into a stufed animal. It is very soft and looks nice, but is a bad puppet"
1,Huge dissapointment,"This puppet is so cute in the photo online, and I had high hopes that it would be a nice gift for my nephew, a big Curious George fan. The fact is it's not exactly like the pictured one, being less and differently stuffed in the head so the face looks baggy and not friendly at all. The arms also seem much longer than the one shown, and my much longer than average fingers only reach George's elbow. This makes for gimpy, limited movements that are just pathetic. Where in the photo George can apparently bend his arm to wave, I can only get him to bend at the shoulder. Too bad the mouth doesn't move to make up for the arms. This puppet is very soft, but in my opinion not snywhere near as cute in person as other Curious George stuffed animals (without the puppet feature), and so not worth the time or money."
3,Not as good as pictured.,"Because of the way it's stuffed, it's not quite as cute as it's pictured. The head seems a little off (maybe needs a bit more stuffing) and the body is pretty stocky (wide at the shoulders, in particular). This may only pertain to the one I bought, though. Also, you'd need a pretty big hand to control it all (certainly larger than a child's hand). So it may sit on the shelf, but for the very low price I paid for it on Amazon, I'm not too disappointed."
2,"another poorly painted product, but is very entertaining for kids","This toy, along with all the other fine dragon/fantasy toys and games that come with it is a highly durable, attractive toy. If you paint it, that is. I found the general paint job to be a little lacking. Basically, the entire dragon was painted blue, highlighted with black (toes/claws)yellow (underbelly) and white. There is no antique on the wings which makes them look rather cheap and artificial. I recommend that the first thing to be done when this toy is received is that an antique coating be applied to the wings and haunches. My toy came with the ""fire"" completely unpainted, but that was soon fixed with some acrylic paint. In spite of my disappointment, this was an outstanding toy for the kids who immediately played with it and still love it. Well, I didn't love it and it was I who paid for it. I highly recommend this to children of all types and ages (above 4). Buy it and then paint it to suit."
4,Nice Choice for Us,"My son is 4 1/2 and I know he will love this dragon. The detail is really good and nice paint job. My only concern would be the tongue seems to appear that it might break off easily, but that depends on how rough your child may play with it. My son is really into making stories of dinasours & dragons and this will be a big hit with him. Even if the tongue does break off he will continue to play with this toy."
2,Not what I wanted at all.,"Sellers like you who pull the bait and switch lisitng should get removed from Amazon completely. This was listed as a pinata. Imagine my surprise when a small, model dragon arrived. No time to return it so I gave it to my son anyway, but what a crock."
4,Really Good,"Perfect - No. Really Good - Yes. For instance: One of the CDs (Essential Texas Blues) includes The Fabulous Thunderbirds but not Stevie Ray Vaughan. Whoa! That is practically sacrilege. Yes, I know the joke about S.R.V. being over covered (Quest: How many coverbands does it take to cover Stevie Ray Vaughan? Ans: All of them, apparently.), but this is a compulation of greats.Each of the CDs can be picked upon, by why focus on the negative? Over all it is an excellent collection of the Blues, perfect for downloading to your iPod for that Blues fix you sometimes need to get you through the day. To HOB, Cheers!"
2,Sure it looks nice...,"This kettle has a handle that gets extremely hot when boiling, beware! I also found the whistling to be irritating, much like nails on a chalkboard. The kettle does look nice, but I have since bought a wonderful kettle that has a more sophisticated appearance and performs excellent for the same price at Strawbridge's."
1,"enamel chips, chrome peels off handle","I've owned this tea kettle for about five years. I bought it when I first moved out on my own and I thought it looked cool. I had to return my first one in 1-2 days because some of the enamel was cracked. My current one has chipped off enamel and now the ""chrome"" on the handle is pealing off. I've kept if for so long because I rarely drink tea and I just use it to diffuse heat from a hot burner. I get compliments on the look of it all the time. It does look nice and if you a tea kettle just to make your stove look cool then maybe this will work for you. I forgot to mention, the handle gets hot and the interior enamel is rough so it never feels clean."
3,Stylish and Sort of Functional,"Very stylish with a great-looking finish. However, the handle gets very hot and it is a little awkward trying to open the spout cover with a pot holder. I don't use it that often so it doesn't really bother me, but if you use your teakettle frequently it may present itself as a nuisance."
5,An enjoyable read,"This book was too hard to put down. My sister bought it and read it in a day and said the book was good. I read it after her and she was right about that. The author with her social knowledge of the French, made it entertaining and worthwhile to read. Imagine yourself in Paris at a cafe by yourself elegantly dressed and calm and by chance a man seeks your affections. This book was a breath of fresh air as to how French women celebrate their feminity and embrace life. They don't let the little stuff worry them like some of us do. While I was reading this book, I felt a bit more satisfied with who I am and how I should celebrate myself as a woman."
2,Repetitive and disjointed,"Not as good as ""Entre Nous"" - less fun and more academic. But even then it is not a well written essay. The few good salient points are repeated too often, and with not much creativity or development."
2,Not what it purports to be,"I wish I had heeded ""Amberlis's"" review. This is no more than a long essay describing various French women in history and some attitudes of modern French women. The historical references are interesting, but several are repeated (some more than once) in different chapters of the book; and the last chapter (quoting at length from Henry VIII's diaries regarding his amorous adventures with a French woman) seems to have been thrown in to make the book seem longer and more titillating. The most annoying feature is the large number of typographical and grammatical errors (for example, ""chaise lounge"" instead of ""chaise longue)."" I would have enjoyed reading a condensed (and better edited)version in the New Yorker, but I really regret having paid $10.00 for the book."
1,pretty light weight,"though some pieces were interesting, it was writtine in a very unintersting manner,a nd flet more like a re-telling of data and opinions of others. I think there were opportunites missed for the topic. Not nearly as good as other Francophile books like ""Entre Nous"", and French Women Don't get Fat."
2,Not quite the fatale i wanted,"i received this book quite a few weeks ago so i am therefore writing from memory as i read quite a lot,,,there is quite a bit of history and historical background in this book...a tad too much and not enough present day stuff...a plethora of interviews with a variety of of french women - their thoughts and ideas on how they actually do do it.is what is required if this book is to live up to its name...it did not equip me with ideas of how to go forward and forever more a femme fatale at least on my downtime....needs quite a bit of reworking/editing"
2,How to Get Laid: A Guide for Homely Women,"This pamphlet struck me as a fluffy term paper on how to get laid for less than attractive women. Do we really need to be told how to do that? Ms. Kunz points out on the first page there are few pretty French women - Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve being the two exceptions. Nevertheless, the French female has a unique ability to get men to leave their wives' and hop into their ""femmes franais"" beds. This is the thesis throughout the slim volume. She proceeds to give examples of the wiles of the French 'vamp' and 'coquette,'(you can find them in every issue of 'Cosmo') with 'petit' hints to be like them (if you're so desperate.) Most of us girls just need to SHOW UP!When Ms Kunz gets her palpable, sexual frustration under control (hint: use French tricks) she may write something worthwhile.Note: The illustrations aren't bad."
3,pretty darn good,some awesome guys who are from oklahoma who put everything into their shows! even pain and blood! too bad they broke up....buy this cd you wont regret it!
4,No problems,"Product is exactly as described with the exception that it appears darker in the picture than it actually is on my Jeep. Still, I suppose this quality only saves me from the hassles of being pulled over more frequently as this type of cover is illegal in my state. Have only had them on for a couple of weeks but so far so good and haven't been harrassed yet.(knock on wood)"
5,Great Ballads...Past and Present,"A very sweet recording. Each song is handled with care and executed with a relaxed swing. The record is consistantly mellow which makes is it perfect for relaxing moments. Guitarist, Hank Mackie, is a gem and is very reminiscent of George Van Eps. His tone and chord selection are as tasteful as any of the greats and his timing and phrasing is superior. Clarinetist, Tim Laughlin, is a wonderful player. His tone is warm and his solos are concise, melodic and swingin' As a lover of great guitar music, I only wish that I could hear more of Hank Mackie."
2,If you have listened to Carl Cox before you may be disappointed,"This album is a divergence from the normally upbeat dance music Carl Cox usaully spins. This album has its moments, however it is mostly downbeat. I was just suprised."
5,found it,I live in a small town and I could not find them at the local hardware store. So I was glad to have fond them.
4,visiting vocalcity,Some would say that Tessio is the worst track in the album. I differ from that statement. Tessio is amazing and this record is amazing. The parts in it that have lyrics sound like half-bits of conversations and that's what listening to this album feels like. Being in a certain space for a certain time. Visiting a Vocalcity.
3,RaggTopp leather kit,An okay product.... Leaves the seats a little sticky and it did NOT come with the applicators as pictured. I received a microfiber cloth and a cloth covered sponge.
5,William Ratcliff,"This opera was a modest success when it was first performed at La Scala on February 16, 1895, with the composer conducting. However, it has not fared well since, even though Mascagni always claimed that it was his personal favorite. It is a sprawling work, with a bloody plot (the hero kills the heroine, her father, then himself). The libretto is problematic in that there is little action, with most of the story unfolding via narrative. Nevertheless, the music is most enjoyable, and this recording from 1963 is an excellent one."
3,Could have been better,It was alright most of the songs I liked but some just didn't fit the title mejores exitos. I'd just wait until it's on sale.
1,This was obviously hexed,I found the book to be absolutely horrible. It was written very quick and is full of spells without instruction on how to do them. It involves a dedication ritual which involves pricking your finger and she discussed when she was younger and she put two fingers under a friend and made her levitate. GIVE ME A BREAK!
4,THIS IS A COOL BOOK!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK TODAY,SO THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING IT ONLY FOUR STARS.BUT FROM WHAT I READ SO FAR,THIS IS A COOL BOOK!!I KNOW IT'S FOR TEENS(I'M 29)BUT I'M VERY YOUNG FOR MY AGE.BUT I HAVEREAD OTHER BOOKS WRITTEN FOR A BEGINNER ON THE PATH AND THEY JUSTDIDN'T LIGHT A SPARK WITHIN ME,AND THEY WERE VERY CONFUSING FOR ME.BUT FIONA EXPLAINS EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK STRAIGHT FOWARD ANDSIMPLE.I AM NEW TO THIS PATH,AND THIS BOOK IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.I'M REALLY GLAD A BOOK LIKE THIS IS OUT THERE FOR TEENS BECAUSE ALL TEENAGERS NEED POSITIVITY IN THEIR LIVES ANDTHEY DON'T NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO THEM LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.THEY KNOW ALOT MORE THAN PEOPLE REALIZE.FIONA,YOU'RE TOTALLY COOL!!... =)"
4,Magical Fun,"This is excellent book for anyone interested in witchcraft. Although it is geared toward teens, it is great for adults too. It is easy to read and understand."
5,AN AWESOME BOOK!!!,"This book is very good!!! It has everything you need to know about becoming a Witch. It even has some spells, and in the back, it has an index of Wicca supplies/terms. I DEFINITELY reccomend this book to any teen interested in becoming a Witch!!! It's truely amazing, and worth EVERY penny!!!"
5,greattttt book!!!,"this book is a brilliant book for teenagers who are thinking about becoming a witch as it tells you about the consequences ad about all the fun stuff.this was my first witch book and it helped me very much with my choice of becomming a witchThe author is an amazing woman who works on tv and radio, works as modernized witchauthor fiona horneKATIE CARPENTER"
5,Regla de Congo/Palo,"Very good book, long read, however worth the read. You need time to understand the rules of el congo. Good book."
2,Esther nearly drowns,"This film has the elements of an entertaining film, but fails largely due to the operatic sequences with Lauritz Melchior. He completely spoiled Esther's THRILL OF A ROMANCE (1945) and only Jimmy Durante keeps him from drowning this one, too. I don't mind operatic singing, but it just doesn't belong in a lightweight film like this."
4,Did it conceal your wires YES!,"Had to cover up about 8 wires going up to the TV and this did the trick.Easy to use, put up the back piece put in the wires(I taped mine in place to keep them from moving) and snap on the front.I painted mine to match the wall but be careful as the paint will scrape right off if you are not careful"
2,Why I didn't buy this,"This is obviously fake. There are only a few of these in the world, so only an idiot would sell one for this price... unless its fake! And how could you possibly have 16 new? They haven't even made these since 1999, and with such small supply, you couldn't get 16 of the normal edition, much less 16 new! So unless you can prove it is real, I'll look somewhere else to get this card."
1,A total rip off!,This card is a rip off. My friend went to the movie theater one time and the ushers were giving out this card for free. A total fake!
1,Wow,Ummm I remember this they were giving it away for free when you went to see the Pokemon movie about the legendary birds
4,Pokemon Ancient Mew,"I bought this for my 10 year old grandson. He really liked it. I personally didn't get the attraction. It was well sealed, which would be good for collecting. I think it would be nice to get some information about the meaning of this card, included with it."
3,Really basic,"The title says it all. This is a very basic book about greenhouse gardening, I was especially disappointed in the limited number of plants described. I was hoping to see a little more info on plant propagation, but it just touched on a few, basic plants. Seemed a little top heavy with veggies talked about more than flowers.Another thing that bothered me was that some of the author's opinions went against everything I have ever seen in my experience. For example, ease of care in keeping kalanchoes blooming and alive. I have found them to be one of the easiest of plants to keep blooming. The author said they are rather hard to get to rebloom and that many people throw them away after blooming. They grow like weeds. I've had them for years and they rebloom constantly. They do extremely well in greenhouses. This was just one example of info I had a problem with.The really basic info presented and the kalanchoe differences made this a book I won't be consulting in the future."
4,Good Content/Very Helpful,Most books on Greenhouse Gardening focus on the building of the greenhouse itself and don't spend enough time talking about the gardening process. This is a great book for a person who moves into a new home and already has a greenhouse. This book is an excellent education in greenhouse gardening.
1,"Yikes, what a terrible book.","Wow, I am seriously disappointed in this book. The fat bashing, the mean, mean kids - what a example! It was written so simplistically - not an interesting verb other than when Elsie ""plopped"" into her chair. The characters were -more like caricatures. The evil name calling, the mean teacher, hitchhiking, neglectful parents, omg! It wasn't written with the grace and feelings needed to carry those heavy themes. I would never recommend this one to student and I'm glad I didn't ask my daughter to read it. Sure, it's a happy ending at least though."
5,Nothing's Fair In Fifth Grade,I like this book it is funny and good and I like Elsie. I thought it was funny when Jenny got a b minus and Diane got a c minus.-Starr 4th Grade LDL
5,I loved this book so much,"I was in 5th grade 11 years ago and this was one of the books our class was required to read on our reading list and to write a book report on. I could completely relate to this book at the time, because although I never had weight problems like Elsie in the book, I was treated as an outcast in class and could relate to how Elsie must have felt. I think the kids were really mean to her, and her mother was an insensitive individual with no feelings, but once they began to see her for who she really is, Jenny and Diane became friends with her after Jenny started getting math help from her and grew to like her as she got to know her and her struggles better. I liked the parts where they had the sleepover party and how they got into the stranger's car. A good read."
1,Awesomeness,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this book so much. I'm glad I got nothings fair in 5 grade for my kindle fire
4,Complex characters; rewarding at the end,"I have to say, I would have given up on this book except that my daughter never lets me do that. (I was reading it to her, she's seven).I'm glad I stuck with it because the second half of the book rewards the reader with a faster-paced story and satisfyingly complex characters for a book at this level.NOTE: Don't dismiss the one-star review here by C. Butterfield. S/he makes some very valid points. I also cringed at the mean mockery of Elsie, the the fat girl, but I, instead, gave DeClements credit for the realism of that, since I'm sure it's even worse for fat kids in reality.As for the ""scary"" chapter ... it was! But, by then, I was totally in need of some action happening in the story.I totally agree with Butterfield's criticism about the plot structure. It's not very good -- but this is a short book, so you can easily plow through the weak areas."
3,Nothings Fair In Fifth Grade,"Ok my book is about a girl named Elise and she became a new student at Diane's school. Elise was a rather big girl and ate a lot. Well, one day at school all of the student's money was missing for lunch and all the kids were getting angry because when they didn't bring their money they would have to eat hard peanut butter sandwiches, and they would think it was Elise. It turns out it was her. One day Elise got in trouble by the principal for taking people's food. Now she's on a diet because she's way too big.My favorite part of the story was when the teacher made everyone get into Social Studies groups and Diane was put with Elise and one of Diane's friends and Elise was telling them how Elise's mom never did anything with her because she didn't want people to know that Elise is her Daughter."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR CHILDREN,"I am absolutely appalled by this book. I read it as a child, and it encouraged my extreme fear of fat-ness. I remember thinking, after reading of this book, ""There must be nothing worse in the whole world than being fat."" After all, Elsie is labeled as ""lazy"", ""undisciplined"", ""unworthy"", ""gross"", ""a pig"", merely because she is a large person. No one in this book begins to accept Elsie for who she is until she loses weight. This book is only another vehicle of the lethal message of our culture that ""fat is bad"". I say ""lethal"" because for the past year, I have been in the hospital for the anorexia I developed as a child. I almost died. It's really time we all started asking ourselves ""why must the human body be a source of shame?"". After all, our body is our greatest earthly possession. It is the container of the human soul."
3,Webblies wobbly but they don't fall down,"I was surprised I had to put it together, which wouldn't be a big deal, except there were no holes for the screws so the bottom cloth ripped. There where notpads for the bottoms of the legs, so they are slick and scracth my floor. Do to the fact that I didn't get it put together right the legs aren't even and it wobbles. If I wantrd a job I would have put in an application, not paid good money for one."
1,Dissatisfied Customer for 1 product and gave the other prodct a 5 star rating,"This product arrived over 10 days after the promised date. The quality issubstandard for the price. I will not use Visiondecor Furniture in the future.The other item I purchased was the book ""CONVINCED"" by Sylane Mack.I gave this book a 5 star rating. This autobiography should be made into amovie. It is a testament to strength and endurance of the human apirit to overcome such terror and find a ""Higher Power"".Actually,I puchased this book for myself and I was so inspired by the author and her story that recently, I purchased several copies and gave them to friends."
3,queen anne style footstool,Found the footstool to be as expected. The colors of the damask were very muted.I would have liked them to be a little deeper toned but that is only my personal taste. Use it all the time .. works perfect.
2,Not worth the hassle,"The stool design was what we wanted, but the quality of the workmanship did not meet our specifications. We purchased two. We couldn't get two of the legs to stay on one of the stools and one leg of the other stool keeps falling off.Don't waste your money on this product!"
1,Disaster - Cute but legs won't stay on.,This product was delivered without threaded leg mount hardware. Just a friction plug-in and a small wood screw for securing each leg. Does not work.A quite similar stool was ordered from Visiondecor Furniture and it had nice threaded mounting hardware for each leg plus the wood screw to keep the leg from turning and it is working just fine.
3,it is too small serves more as a decoration than for usefullness,I was very dissapointed in the size of the ottoman.It is decorative but not worth much for the use I wanted which was to place my feet on it for relaxation usesIt is however very pretty.
3,OK but not the best,"Most of the previous reviews on this DVD did not use superlatives, so I was not expecting much. I paid $6 for the DVD, including shipping, an indication that suggested mediocrity. After viewing the documentary, I felt that it was indeed an OK offering that did give some historical information that I did not know about geisha. The DVD uses mostly still images (a disappointment) and there is only rare motion footage of geisha (probably no more than 2-3 minutes total). Many of the still shots are used over and over (annoying) and the photos are black and whites that have been tinted. In spite of this, I am glad that I purchased the offering since I suffer from geishaphilia and love everything related to geisha. I also ordered ""Secret Life of Geisha,"" narrated by Susan Sarandan and ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" the movie released several years ago. Looking forward to seeing them as well. Sayonara."
3,An interesting history of Japan & the development of the geisha in society.,A nice documentary covering Japan's history and how the geisha developed and changed over the centuries. I wish the producers were able to have an interview or interviews with present day geishas.
4,Can't Get Much Better,"Mr. Levinson is correct in his review of Mr. Crawford.s ""Indigo Blue."" I can not add much more other than it is also good listening in New Hampshire on a cold Feb. night."
1,Known Manufacturing problems,"This is a beautiful television, but it's coming to light that there were manufacturing problems, resulting in a large number of sets leaving the factory that die within weeks of purchase, by being unable to power up. Seehttp://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?s=&threadid;=316921for details. Mine died after 6 days. Let's hope the replacement doesn't have them same problems."
1,Don't buy this set,"Mine lasted 14 months, before it ceased functioning - 2 months more than the warranty. My local service department has been working with Sony support for nearly two months trying to diagnose the problem, and they refuse to replace the set. So far, I have heard everything from the B- block, to the Optical engine, to the power source. What a waste of money."
1,Long awaited for much disappointment,"We bought this tv 6 weeks ago and had to wait that long to receive it. We were so excited to pick it up and install it only to find that there was barely a picture at all. Six weeks of waiting and so far no enjoyment. The technician finally came out today and said that the mirror was broken (probably in shipping) and now the store tells me we have to wait another 10 WEEKS for a new set. I think ""fergeddaboutit""!! What has happened with SONY?? My guess is probably that a bunch of these are going to turn up damaged. It stinks to roll out over 3 grand and have nothing to show for it!!"
1,Do Not Buy This Unit,"We have had this unit two years. It worked well the first year. About six months ago we started seeing blue dots, then blue spots, now we have yellow blotches on the screen. Of course we have had to replace two bulbs. This product is horrible. Sony put out a real lemon. I have owned nothing but Sony products. This is going to be my last. This is a horrible unit."
1,"Lamps Burn Out, model is defective","I purchased the Sony KF-50WE610 in Dec. of 2003. I have had 4 lamp failures in 2 yrs. T.V. is once again, not working and I am waiting for another service call. These t.v.'s have an obvious lamp/bulb defect. I did purchase the extended warranty but if the failures do not occur all in the same 1yr period, they will not replace your t.v., only repair it. I will never purchase a Sony product again."
3,Picture not as good as I thought,"I don't really see the picture very awesome, it looks better than a normal TV.For the same price I was going to buy a panasonic same size, and with much better picture, freakean brand sony it is pretty strong to me, but know I'm starting to think than Sony it is a expensive brand and not the best brand, Hitachi, Panasonic and even sharp are doing very good things and with very competitive prices and technollogy."
3,Good TV aside from immediate outage,"I bought this tv will a little skepticism after reading these reviews. Basically, I agree with everyone. This is a great tv if/when it works. I finally got my cable provider to send down an HD signal and it displays beautifully on screen. Monster cables helped too. But unfortunately, after only a few weeks of enjoyment, the tv goes out. It powers up momentarily with no picture and no sound. Then powers back down. I contacted Sony and they refered me to my local service dealer. Heh, no chance I was going to contact them and sit on a multi-thousand dollar tv that doesn't work for 2 weeks. Instead, I contacted the Best Buy 1-888 number for service and they couldn't get out here for 1 week. Still not good enough. Soooo... I finally contacted the store and asked them to send me a new TV. They're coming out tomorrow to do the exchange. Thank you, Best Buy. Sony... the jury is still out."
2,keep looking,"while they look very nice when new it doesn't take long for them to begin to loose enamel coating and rust. i would not reccomend these or any others like them. save your money and purchase stainless steel, they'll last for years."
3,Aroma Therapy A to Z,The book is great but the first time I used it the binding came apart.. prob just set on a shelf too long
5,Redwall series!,"I have read 12 out of 13 book of this series and they are GREAT my favortie series, next being the Harry potter..... If u enjoy fantasy books and talking mice/rats/ferrets heres a series for you!!!"
1,Copper? Oh no.,"Yes, any amount of simple researching will let you know that copper is ""potentially toxic"" to birds. I have read nothing that would indicate that all metals but stainless steel are unsafe, but copper is indeed unsafe and this toy should NOT be bought. Lead and zinc are deadly to birds as well. I learned (being the ignorant girl I am :P) that ""galvanized"" means coated in zinc. So anything with lead, zinc (includes anything galvanized) and/or copper is unsafe."
2,What is the Bottom Line?!!!,"I'm not sure what book everyone else was reading, but this book made my head absolutely hurt. It jumped from past to present, and had way too much going on in the chapters. I found myself saying GET TO THE POINT ALREADY!!! YOU ARE CIRCLING THE AIRPORT...LAND THIS BABY!!! I just didn't think it was a good read at all, and there has to be something better."
1,Should Get Zero Stars,"I am a very health concious person who pays close attention to what I ingest at all times. This book is absolutely horrible and filled with critical misunderstandings. I have never read anything so abviously trying to fit an agenda(Dr. Hulls book sales I think) in my entire life. Any science she actually quotes is taken out of context completely. She uses examples that quote results from experiments using more splenda in a small animal than a human will consume in a lifetime. From the information I read after this book, Splenda has completed 20 years worth of experiments and for the most part, except in HUGE quantities, it has been determined safe to use. Why and what she is trying to accomplish is a mystery to me, but I feel safer about eating Splenda after reading this junk. I suggest if you do read this book to at least look at other sources for your information so you get the whole picture. I would save my $20 though..."
1,Coo Coo - or is it Quack Quack,"Buy this book and be afraid... nothing is safe. This book is supposed to be about Splenda - unsafe according to the author, safe according to regulators worldwide - but more than half of the book is what she wrote about Aspartame (I know because I read the other book). What a rip off!!Now I'm no scientist but I know that these ingredients are completely different but not so according to the writer. But then she makes loads of wacky connections in this book so one big one makes little difference.This book contains less than 50 pages about Splenda (sorry 89 if you include the Splenda product list!) and then repeats a load of articles about other things that are all available on the internet.Wish I hadn't wasted my money."
1,What a whopper..,"Having spent some time reading such books at the Tipping Point and others, I started grabbing books with scientific claims (and have at least a passing interest in Splenda as I occasionally use products containing it) because I feel much of the science in these books tends to be snippets taking out of context. The only thing I can say is that after reading this book and looking for other materials on the safety of Splenda, is that the author obviously has done no actual research, rather she attempts to take other studies completely out of context to fit her agenda (which seems to be cashing in on the popularity of splenda - Ironic, don't you think?)I think at the least Amazon should reference this book in an urban myths section, or perhaps file under ""bunk science."" All in all, I feel better about the cranberry juice made with splenda I drank while reading this book."
1,"""Dr."" Hull is not a medical doctor","CAVEAT EMPTOR. This book is not based on any credible science. ""Dr."" Hull is not a medical doctor. Just check her site by Googleing her name. But, like my daddy said, most americans will believe almost anything. So good luck ""Dr."" on making money the old fashion way: Dupe the ignorant (selling your stup1d books and your detox pills), just hope you can sleep at night. And if you have children, I hope you have the courage to tell them that you are a con artist."
1,This book is so ridiculous!!!,"My husband was just diagnosed with diabetes and was sent to a dietician who put him on a very low carb diet and also told us to strictly use Splenda when making salad dressings, putting in ice tea, coffee and so on and so on.The author of this book obviously doesn't know what she is talking about. If she had consulted a dietician on the subject of whether Splenda was safe or not, she would haven't written a book against it.I am going by what our doctor and dietician recommends and not by some quack who writes just to make money!"
3,"Sorry folks, Splenda is poison","Splenda was accidentally discovered by scientists trying to create a new kind of Insecticide. Yes, INSECTICIDE. I have not read this book, but I cannot stand back and listen to people claiming that this stuff is actually safe.But don't take my word for it: read ""Sweet Deception,"" by Joseph Mercola. It's all there, every last terrifying, infuriating detail. And no, I'm not Dr Mercola.For those of you who insist on continuing to consume Splenda, as well as Nutrasweet/Aspartame, please at least have the decency to keep it out of the mouths of your children."
1,Wildly inaccurate information.,"In my short stay in Montreal I tried to use this book 3 times, and each time it was wildly inaccurate (after the 3rd try I stopped using it!).They had the wrong address for the Pointé-A-Calliére museum, the wrong cross street for a restaurant called Chez Delmo, and a recommended bar, ""Le Grand Cafe"", did not seem to exist (at least not at that location: they could have been wrong about the address again).Montreal is a great city, but buy something else for a guide book (the only reason I gave this 1 star is because Amazon does not have a rating of 0)."
2,"Interesting book, but tried to use European fantasies","Interesting book, but tried to use European fantasies of being African, indigenous (Egyptian)or Black (the modern European term for African). However it does have some very good information. When you get pass the imperial European denial. You can find some good information in this book. Ancient Nubians and the other ancient Africans, the Kamites (their real name)called Egyptians thousands of years later by the Greeks."
4,"A handy, kana-heavy pocket dictionary","When you are serious about Japanese, you should buy an electronic dictionary. There is no substitute for technology when it comes to number of words, convenience and portability. Of course, good electronic dictionaries are very expensive and quite a commitment.This little fellow is a handy, portable Japanese-English/ English-Japanese dictionary, good for both studying and having around town when you need to look up a word. Because of its portability, it packs a small punch in terms of number of words, and will not be as useful as a larger desk reference.On the good side, the dictionary makes good use of kana and does not present words in romajii. Learning the kana is essential to learning Japanese, and using this dictionary will increase your reading speed.A nice, compact reference to carry around, or take to a coffee shop for study. If you are just starting out with Japanese, this dictionary will be a good helper."
5,love it,"Though there are dictionaries with more words, this dictionary does have alot and its tiny. Its a great referance for anyone (beginner or advanced) due to its portable size and the fact that its pronunciation is written in kana's, not romanji. I highly recommend this dictionary."
5,Excellent book!,Item as described and fast shipping. This book works great for English speakers who want to learn Japanese. It is easy to read at any time and great size to put in the pocket or purse.
1,every bag broke,i got these for my delta 50-760 and every bag has broken at the bottom seam. i guess that's what i get for going cheep. don't waist your money.
1,Bags break at bottom seam,"Like another reviewer, I had the experience that the first two bags out of the box opened up at the bottom seam within minutes of installing them on my Delta dust collector. A real mess! I'm not messing with anymore of these. Heavy duty trash bags work just fine and I've never had a failure."
2,How did such a good band get such a worthless vocalist?,"The grand majority of the music on this album is refreshing and inventive. Sadly, it's nearly impossible to listen to the songs, thanks to the absolutely atrocious lyrics and vocal delivery. There really is no poetry here, only infantile ramblings that would receive rolled eyes from even the most uninformed of listeners."
5,Exactly what FFTL fans wanted!,"The new album ""Heroine"" is what I was really hoping to here from these guys. The new cd has a strange flow which is some thing you dont find in albums these days, Sonys voice has strengthened a whole lot since he has been in the band (knowing he was 16 when he joined) and everything will only go up from here."
2,eh.,"This CD was disappointing, frankly. You can really get into some songs, but other songs are just a waste, really. It's a great CD when you just want to mope, but personally, I like to have something to sing to, and few of the songs did that."
1,Heroine - Their drug of choice wile making music,"Heroine is a horrible CD. Though Sonny Moore is a better vocalist than FFTL's last, he has no talent in song writing or creating. With Lyrics such as ""I can't eat anything without shoving my hands down my throat"" and ""Do you know what it's like to feel ugly all the time?"" leads me to believe that he didn't write the majority of songs for the last CD.The CD sounds dark and depressing, and everyone I talk to seems to agree it blows. I dont agree at all with the other comments posted and reccomend stealing songs off Lime Wire instead of wasting money on this.I found that I only slightly enjoyed one song off this CD and that took time to get used to it. Please understand that music should be an ""aquired taste"" and forcing yourself to like this just isn't worth it."
4,pretty good,"its a giant leap from dear diary. to me, it has more of a darker vibe to it. theres more detail in sonny's lyrics, and you can feel his agony rather than the anger in dear diary. the stad out tracks in my opinion are ...And We All Have A Hell and Waltz Moore."
4,The band has finally found their sound,"The band has definately grown since Dear Diary. I think this is an exceptional album, and I absolutely love it. A couple songs off the album bore me, but only one or two. Sonny's voice sounds excellent, and the drums are fantastic. The only thing that I dislike about this album is that all the songs flow so well that it sounds like your listening to one huge song. But if you're a dedicated fan like myself, the album grows on you and you appreciate it more and more everyday. Buy this album, its worth it."
4,Sub-Par,"This release is a great one. However it does not compare with the original ""Dear Diary, My Teenage Angst has a Bodycount"" It seem almost all of the tracks are filler tracks and the entire album must have been spit out at the last minute. That being said the band From First To Last is still very talented both musicaly and lyricly."
4,good movie! in good condition,"I was glad to get this movie promptly and in good condition. I like Gregory Peck, esp. his romantic movies. I hadn't seen this one before, so it was nice to have it to add to my collection."
5,The World in His Arms,"This movie of Gregory Peck's is, in my opinion, one of his best. Full of action. Great. But, where can it be found in DVD?"
5,the World in his Arms,An oldy but goody . Gregore Peck & Ann Blyth & Anthony Quinn in old Alaska with a great subporting cast . One of my favorits . I have'nt been able to find this old movie any where till Amazon brouht it out for all us older movie bluffs . Thanks Amazon .
4,The World in His arms.,"A great love story with two of my favorite characters. They just don't make movies like they used to.I have watched this movie more than once, does that say it all, or not?"
3,"Okay, but just okay.","The DVD content was presented on a such a low level, it didn't hold my daughter's interest and not worth as much as was paid."
4,"Enjoyable, with the normal Sutherland reservations","This is an enjoyable and overdue reissue from Joan Sutherland. She was uniquely poised to expose opera fans to this mostly unfamiliar repertoire. That said, it is a qualified success. High points include the waltz song from Mireille (putting Fleming's recent outing to shame) and an aria from Auber's Manon Lescaut that finds her diction uncharacteristically strong. The Doll Song from Hoffman is also stunning if mushy, with a trill on a high C that must be heard to be believed. Avoid the tracks from Louise, Pecheurs and Faust. They're well known and are performed in a droopy and muddled manner. All in all, superb bravura singing from the master."
4,Glad to see it on DVD,"The infamous banned show by upset parents in the 80's is finally on DVD thanks to CBS/Paramount. I can't for the life of me figure out why this was pulled from TV in the first place. It's not as vulgar and disgusting as the movie, but still a lot of fun for GPK fans. Its an odd structure for a cartoon, with the first half being movie parodies and the second half featuring the Garbage Gang. The show has a Where's Waldo approach with numerous cameos of GPK characters hiding all over the place, and it's fun to spot them. Works well as a double feature with the Madballs cartoon."
3,ITS BAD and GOOD and then BAD again but not GROSS,"For a die hard fan i say have it in your collection, but it was a bad series concept. Its not GROSS how the cards are, no vomit, no boogers, no dismemberment. WHY because it was a netowrk cartoon from the 80's with im sure poor judgemnt on what to do with it. If it were made now im sure ADULT SWIM and FAMILY GUY humor witht he excess vomiting and snot would have made it a hit. For you comic fans Geoff Darrow (big guy and rusty) he did the character modeling and KREE SUMMERS who has doen a million voices did work on this too!>>SIGH<< if it were only full of vomit and crude humor..."
3,"Three stars for being GPK, but just not a good cartoon, likely the reason it never aired.","I was a huge GPK fan, series 4-16 of the originals with the alternate in the 4th series. I have posters and many of the toys that were released as well. And when the movie was released on DVD, great memories returned. But when I ran across this on Amazon, it suprised me. Now I see from the web and other reviewers that this series never aired. So now I have these ""lost treasures""....but they aren't that great. I skipped around a little to see if the episodes varied in quality of content, but they don't, there just blah. They aren't gross, and the characters are just bad interpretations (and drawings) of some of the GPK cards. To bad. Could have been something, just executed wrong. But, I can imagine that it would be hard to write a cartoon from so many strange characters, Kudos for trying. A collectors item for hardcore fans, but not a must have. Get the movie, it cheesy, but funny."
5,fantastic!,"Love it or hate it..... GPK fans need to unite and show Topps that we care about GPK.My recommendation is to purchase this for the nostalgia (because it really is worth it) and purchase this dvd setto prove that GPK is worth continuing.5 stars, my highest recommendation.Long live GPK!"
4,Good cookbook,I have read through the cookbook and have to say it is very good. It has chinese and english so you can read the recipe in one language or the other or both. Not sure its worth as much money though as I bought it for but it does have good recipes in it. I do recognize some of these recipes from items I would buy in china town.
1,This cookbook does not use conventional measuring system,"I had great trouble using this book due to the measuring system this cookbook uses. For example, one recipe calls for ""4 2/3 oz. (132 g) cake flour (66%)"" What does this mean? How many cups or tablespoon is ""4 2/3 oz.""? What is 66%? and what is ""cake flour""?"
5,Remember The Hippo in San Francisco?,"I have fond memories of The Hippo on Van Ness in San Francisco, so I was delighted to find this book. I haven't used the recipes, but will someday when I have more time to putter around in the kitchen. The Hippo was the best burger place in the world, in my opinion. The book is fun to read even if you don't use the recipes!"
4,A different angle than Tom Ashbrook's The Leap,"Compares favorably to the better known recent book describing an Internet startup, The Leap by Tom Ashbrook, which is more of a personal journey and tells you what to expect as a participant.In contrast, Rippy and Kursh's book gives you more analytical tools to analyze startups (they slant towards Internet startups, but it's still useful for those interested in biotech and other fields). It's not just how much venture capital money that the founders have raised, and the professional expertise of the founders (though those are both important). Before you take The Leap, read a book that actually analyzes it."
2,Boring!,"Frankly, I don't think its worth the money. Some decent facts in here but not too interesting- but it might put you to sleep."
5,great speakers,The mtx tp112 is a great entry level speaker..sound is very clean.bass matches and is very well constructed.
3,GOOD,THIS IS A GOOD SPEAKER FOR THE MONEY AND FAST SHIPPING. MTX IS A GOO BRAND SURE BETTER THAN PYLE I WAS GOING TO GET A 15 INCH PYLE DJ SPEAKER FOR THE SAME PRICE BUT I WENT WITH THIS CAUSE ITS MTX I ALWAYS LIKED MTX.
5,Incredible story,"I had no idea that there were such progressive thinking Mormons. I loved the book, so did my 84 year old mother . Thank you Carol Lynn."
3,"Not the best, but it was the first","I became a HUGE fan of GrooveLilly when I saw them in the summer of 2006 performing in a musical version of A Midsummer Night's Dream. I have since picked up several of this interesting and innovative band's CDs. This one was a disappointment. It completely lacked the edge of Ms. Vagoda's later albums. This particular CD feels like a slightly pop-inspired easy listening/jazz endeavor. Valarie Vagoda's artful Violin-playing is under-utilized and the group lacks the interesting, musical edge that is later brought by keyboardist Brendan Milburn and drummer Gene Levin.That is not to say that the album is entirely bad. The music is pretty, Ms. Vagoda's voice is as beautiful as ever, and the album has a late-80s feel that I found a bit nostalgic.Ultimately, unless you are already a GooveLilly completist, avoid this album and instead pick up the fantastic ""Little Light"" or (my favorite) ""Striking 12""."
3,Irwin seems better,"Not much to say about this, except that it really isn't worth what it costs. Made in China, with poor finish and not 100% concentric. The Irwin products offered by the ""big box stores"" seem to be better."
1,amber1845,"I was soooo dissapointed. I'm new at playing video games, so i didn't know that this product would be the complete opposite of the commercials i saw for final fantasy.Please, for your sake, do NOT buy this product. I'll bet the games further on in the series are what i was expecting, but still, i wish someone had warned me about that...so i'm putting it out there"
2,Short and sweet:,"This is old school technology, turn based role playing. If you like that kind of thing, you will most likely love the game. I thought I would but was left pounding my legs on the bed at the constant interuptions of the turn based fights that pop up every time you move(slight exaggeration). Because I am a gaming geek, I did finish this and played it for 30 hours. Ten or fifteen years ago -- would have loved it. Now? With new tech and games like WoW and such...forget it!"
4,A Game Remastered,"Since 1987, Final Fantasy was one of the games that got Square out on top and is one of my favorite franchises to date. Twenty years later, Final Fantasy is back and redone for the PSP. The game is much better with a 16x9 Widescreen which is perfect for a larger horizontal perspective. The sprites look way much better than ever and all the extras from Dawn of Souls are there along with an additional dungeon that can put your skills to the ultimate test. Sure the game is a bit easy but the fun is to relive a game that has went through the test of time. Nonetheless, if you are a Final Fantasy fan and own a PSP, this is for you."
2,"When, God, When?","Very, very short, somewhat disappointing, not exactly what I was looking for, or what I expected."
2,"When, God, When? Learning to Trust in God's Timing",This was a very thin book for the price. I didn't get a lot out of it. I love spiritual books but this one was not very informative and each page there was just a lot of repition. I got bored with it.
4,understanding 'in due season',"We've heard it said that God's timing is perfect, but does it really seem that way in your life? Are you feeling the sting of trying to speed things up through your own efforts and falling short, or are you simply tired of waiting? Are you hoping to gain some understanding about why God does things when He does?This very brief book explores what Scripture tells us about God's perfect timing and how it applies to our lives. Meyer shares her own experiences, both positive and negative, relating to God's timing and how it has affected her ministry. Through these pages you will not only learn to grow in patience and endurance, but also to enjoy the journey.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"
5,Learning to trust,"A good book about the timing of God rather than our own. It has helped me learn that the more patient we are and trust in Him for everything, the quieter we become in our spirit which leads to hearing Him more clearly. In short, faith grows proportional to our patient trust in Him and willingness to change the blocks in us that hinder the answer to our prayer."
5,READ AFTER READING WHY GOD WHY,"When I was going through some strange stuff in my life I bought this book. It actually showed me that not in my time, but in God's time everything will be over and I would be victorious. Patience is a virtue."
1,don't compare this to rbl ruthless by law!!!,"this cd doesn't have that sick flow and high pitched synth peircen thru the tracks like rbl's ruthless by law! respect to the dead, but this cd does not flow in my opinion....."

1,Avoid this printer,"I purchased this printer. I first tried to install this as a USB printer. Using the enclosed software disk, I got a continual error because the ""hpc20155.xml"" file was missing. I downloaded the latest software files. I still received the error. HP help was worthless. I have always used HP lasers. Avoid this printer!!! It is the first hardware in 22 years that I could not install!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"This printer only worked properly for about a year. Soon after, the printer would not show up on the network. I assumed this was due to a changing IP address, and initially it was. After the second or third time, however, the printer would not even print a test page when manually selecting from the printer console. Now nothing on the printer seems to work, and the alarm signal flashes but when investigating with the software provided, no alarms come up. This one was a waste of some hard earned money."
1,Disappointing,"I've always owned HP printers, and this was purchased less than two years ago to replace a 1987 vintage LaserJet III that was still working! Much to my disappointment, this model has been a struggle since the very difficult installation. As has been noted in other reviews, one day it just stopped working, and will occasionally print if I flip the on/off switch just prior to the print. After spending more than [...] for this model, including a second paper drawer, I am soured on HP and will be looking to replace this with another brand."
5,Excellent for home office,"I have used an HP 4M Plus for over 10 years, but it did not work well with my new Macs.I bought the 2015DN about 2 weeks ago and have been very impressed with its speed and quality. I especially like the duplex printing. I have had absolutely no problems using duplex with my Macs.I highly recommend it,"
1,Small Manu Defect Makes for BIG headache,"After a month of what has been a great printer (maybe 100pp total so far), a glitch developed. The roller needs to be cleaned. (!) This inhibits the automatic paper feed to work.Spent half a day on the phone with HP. Absolutely bad. The fix is to do it yourself, which is crazy. I have added memory to printers, computers, swapped out Hard Drives..etc. This little job is not for the faint of heart. After several attempts (consulting HPs support doc sent to me on the 2d phone call of the day to HP), I had to call again. Something wasn't right. Bottom line, this pain in the neck has exposed to me how poor customer relations is at HP. No axe to grind, but if it wasn't so sad, it would be funny.I am exhausted and frustrated and, yeah, mad at this whole thing. MOre to the story, but right now, I will not buy another HP product again."
2,Installation problem,"Installation as a Windows XP/USB printer generated an error message (the installation software was looking for a file ""HPC20155.xml""). A search of the Web turns up literally hundreds of mentions of this problem, some three or four months old, yet the HP installation disk (and written documentation) does absolutely nothing to address this. Search of the HP Web site turns up a ""fix"" for this problem (which somehow doesn't involve the HPC20155.xml file), but HP's instructions are sketchy at best. My advice: When your computer rejects the HP fix, just keep trying. Maybe after 10 tries or so, each of which seems to fail, the HP fix will mysteriously work, and your printer will be installed. Disgraceful that a printer sold in 2008 by a major company should be this difficult to install."
2,Only Medium Quality Text & Graphics Printing,"I purchased this item to specifically print small instruction booklets in b&w.; My requirements are crisp, black, high quality text and crisp, black lines for vector based line drawings. It has not met these expectations. Fortunately I purchased the printer at Staples so I can return within 14 days which I plan to do.I did samples with all the different dpi quality options. There is variation between them but all results have a screened look to the text. The edges are jagged to the eye and large, bolded headings print too light, not a saturated black. Nothing comes close to the quality I currently print on an HP 2550 printer.I'm disappointed with the quality issues because the other features I purchased the printer for are outstanding: speed, duplex printing, quiet, easy to install, cost."
2,problem printer,"worked fine for about 1.5 years. then problems with formatter board and memory. For the money, there are better printers out there. Disappointed with this HP model"
4,A fix for the HP 2015,"I really like this printer. I have one at work and purchased one at home. The one at work experience the same issue as many here have described - formatter board failure. After reading lots of complaints in forums, I found one that offered some hope. It can be found at [...]. Apparantly there are some connections on the board that did not get baked properly in production. The process described here has you take out the board, heat it in an over for 5-8 minutes. It worked for me, and apparantly many others too.There is no excuse for HP, and I understand the disappointment and anger. However, if the printer is sitting around, you really don't have much to lose trying this. Good luck."
1,Worthless Junk !!! Avoid HP products,"I've had this printer for less than a year and I'm experiencing numerous issues with it. The paper feed and jamming was the first issue. Now, it won't boot up. My computers fail to recognize the device. I've reinstalled it several times, replaced the cables, so it has to be the printer itself. I'm forced to buy a new printer even though this one is less than a year old and I just bought a new cartridge for it. HP won't give you phone tech support unless you purchase a ""plan"" from them. So, you make a crappy product, then charge people to call in for support on how to fix it. What a scam!! I'll glady involve myself in a class action suit against HP if the rest of you want to sue."
2,Check the price for the replacement print cartridge first!!!,"I was thrilled when I first bought the HP LASER JET P2015 Printer, but that feeling did not last long.This printer does print fast,but the replacement cartridge (53x)cost around $169.00 to replace. I am an accountant and went through 7 cartridges during the three and a half month tax season."
4,A MUST FOR Every Presbyterian Elder.,Insightful information on Church polity and proceedure. It allows one to use the Book of Order to further the ends of the particular Church with confidence and prayerful surety. I am buying this copy for a newly ordained elder.
2,Study with this book - Fail the CVoice exam,"If you are looking for a good preparation for taking the CVoice exam, then keep looking. This book has a lot of good info in general, but as a test prep it misses the mark. Just ask me since I studied the crap out of this text and failed miserably on the exam. I guess I'm used to books that help me prepare to actually *pass* exams! For example, MGCP gets about 1 paragraph in this book.. but the exam requires in-depth knowledge of that protocol ...which I now see was indicated on Cisco's test blueprint all this time. Sigh.If you need VoWhatever info, just get articles off the Cisco website, and save your money."
2,I wonder why it was given a 5 star,"Used this book and boson software to give the exam and passed with 912 todayThe book needs to go in to editing again as there are too many errors!!!.There is no flow or order to the book and things are repeated all over the place. I had to read the book twice to start making sense of it plus the errors didn't help. Not a good book if you really want to understand the conceptsThe only good I can say about the book is it covers the exam entirely and the 4 pages on the different queueing techniques.The only reason why I got a good mark is that the exam is toooo easy, come on cisco??? and boson practice tests covers it all."
5,Formidable ultima produccion,"Nuevos temas de los enanos, entre ellos, los mas destacados Mil Historias y Tibio Corazon. Son canciones con un feeling ""ultra romantico"". Me gustan mucho Una absurda cancion de amor, Tan solo un instante, Ganar, Vivir sin tu amor. Aguanten los enanos!!!"
2,Buy at your own risk...........,I admit that the reason I purchased this book was in part due to the IR nature of the book. However after having read and enjoyed another book written by this author titled Exiled I was annoyed beyond reason by this book. It started out as a rather interesting storyline then around the middle of the storyline it crossed over into what the heck happened. It felt like the author became distracted while telling the story. I felt like the author was soooo busy trying to be politically correct that she just gave up and said this should do. This is sooooo not up to par with her other stories. I love futuristic and scifi genres but I just did not feel anything for the main characters. If you should come across this book at a library near you then borrow it.
5,Can I give this 10 stars?!,"If you love 1960s music, this one is great. While Jerry Fuller is the primary lead singer, Dave Burgess and Glen Campbell are also featured. There are funny songs and a variety of styles. The songs that include The Fleas and The Trophies are just the best four part harmony. Rick Nelson isn't a featured soloist, but does a very good job on the bass parts. It's still a ""must have"" for a Rick Nelson fan."
2,No R. Nelson Sound Here,Please preview carefully if you encountered this as by R. Nelson. Sounds more like Bobby Vee/R. Orbison amateur tribute hour. No audible Nelson in either younger or more mature (?) days. OK technically and maybe musically. Mr. Bass Man goes wild on a few tracks.
3,good compliation,"First off, this is a riddim cd. therefore all the songs basically have the same beat. I did not know this at the time, and was a lil mad. but the beat that the artist have is hot. its the remix to ""Educated fools"" off JR GONG's ""halfway tree"" big ups to Steve Marley for producing & remixing the song!!my favorite tracks are :1. with Jr Gong and Bounty Killer ( jr gong has new lyrics!10. Spragga Benz and Kymani Marley-- check out kymani flex his dj skillsstrong tracks also by Capleton, Yami Bolo and Mr Mojo (Morgan Heritage)this is a riddim cd, thus the novelty of a great beat will wear off. i consider this type of cd aimed more for DJs.but it a must get for those keeping track of the MaRley's work. and his cd shows reggae/roots is represents strongBLESS"
1,sometimes science is more interesting than personality,"Gleick either doesn't understand mathematics or thinks that the readers can't. So he writes about the personalities of the people involved in the resurgence of chaos theory during the past few decades. Unfortunately, many of the people profiled are tenured faculty at big universities. Most of them don't really have personalities. Gleick will write about these guys facing oppression from skeptical colleagues. As the pages unfold it turns out that the ""oppression"" consists of their colleagues, who are working in unrelated areas, being unmotivated to spend hours looking at line-printer output. A further element of the ""oppression"" that adds drama to Gleick's book is a lifetime guaranteed salary, an office with a nice view, and funding for some graduate students plus computers.You'd learn more science by reading through a stack of old New Yorker magazines..."
3,A huge effort,I can imagine the amount of effort done by the author to collect the different pieces together to construct a consistent line of thought along the whole book. Good piece!
1,Horrible!,This book contains lots of words but absolutely no information. I wanted to read a good book to introduce me to the concept of chaos but this book doesn't even define what chaos is. This book is a real peice of crap.
2,Anecdote and Science,"""Chaos"" is far too much opinionated anecdote and far too little science. All the stories of brilliant mathematicians who worked out the theory, and all the silly physical scientists who couldn't see it was explaining their world, can't cover up the fact that nowhere does Gleick actually explain either the math or the physical science.I came away with the view that there certainly are physical realities (in biology, hydrodynamics, electronics, etc.), that are explained by Chaos Theory, but no idea what the explanation is or how it works.Poor book."
2,chaos theory for non-math people,"this book tells novel-like stories about the scientists and mathematicians, but doesnt go very far into their actual discoveries/theories. gleick touches on some powerful material, but fails to explain it. he includes no equations, so if you dont consider yourself mathematically oriented, this book is fine. i do like the pics of fractals though!"
3,"Great biography, okay science.","This book tells the stories of the scientists responsible for giving birth to and developing chaos theory. These stories are extremely well-written and engaging, but unfortunately the author does not give the science part equal attention. It is a very entertaining book, and you will come away from the book with a genuine curiosity for science in general and chaos theory in particular, but you won't find out much about chaos theory itself. Which is kind of tragic, cos you just finished reading a whole book on the subject. Maybe the writer did not want to get into mathematics. But I still feel kind of cheated."
3,Good primer for Chaos studies,"In this book Gleick tells the story of chaos. It is indeed fascinating but if you wish to explore chaos theory yourself - to explore chaotic functions, etc. (in a sense to eat the pie not just read about it) - then this isn't the book.On another note - anyone able to point towards such a book?"
2,A very shallow book,"Although I have a strong background in chaos and physics, I picked up this book for some background and enjoyment. While I didn't expect a mathematical treatise on chaos, I think Gleick's book is very shallow. There's much more to chaos than butterfly's wings!"
2,Rather Disappointing,"This is an extraordinarily boring book, unless you are interested in reading about chaos and the people involved, blow by blow. It is about the people who somehow contributed in some way to the development of the theory but you will find very little about the theory itself, and much tangential comments and anecdotes. There are other MUCH better books about chaos. My advise is to skip this one."
4,The stories that switch on the lights!,"Gleick introduces chaos in an easy and understandable way, not relying on lots of mathematics. His descriptions of deterministic chaos are accurate and he recounts several stories to help the reader understand the context of the discoveries. Not a book for mathematicians, but rather a book for everybody else that loves a good story about where our current science views are coming from. Read this before you get into Holland and the rest of the manic gang."
5,chaos is even clearer now with this book!,"this book is precise, clear and completely understandable...we are using it in a college course, and the class agrees that this is the best of the books on CHAOS. High school students can easily learn from this book and probably 8th graders also...the illustrations are clear, the sources clearly explained...i would buy it again!"
2,"A good companion book, but more is needed to understand Chaos","This author talks about ""chaos"" without ever revealing defininitive examples. For example, he relates that Lorentz modeled complex (i.e., non-linear) behavior with just three equations, and that these were inpired by the fluid motion of convection. But does he (the author) reveal what the equations are? No Way. In fact, there is not a single equation in the entire book! For someone who is mathematically challenged by balancing their own checkbook, this book gives a big picture (with stunning displays of fractal pictures) of chaos, without required the reader to get his hands dirty. For this mathematically bent, Ph.D. engineer, the book was a disappointment. I now know some physical examples of chaos, but I know no more about the details than I did when I picked up the book."
4,chaos theory,"This book has enlightened me as to chaos theory, and yet is not so complex that it requires a doctorate in higher mathematics. I found that it can be somewhat slow reading, but that is only because there is so much information given in every chapter. there is no extraneous material involved. I think this a very good introductory book in the actual ""theory"" of chaos, as opposed to the ""mathematics"" of chaos."
2,More history than science!,"This book is more of an history book than a science book by volume. It drags on and on over the history of the scientists, however when it gets to explain the chaos characteristics it does so in a choppy way which might make the reader distracted and confused. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
2,Too light!,"The book does hardly exhibit technical deep in the issues described. If you are looking for some weird maths or formulas that can amaze you, try a high-school book instead!"
2,"confusing,","I read chaos right after completing the Waldrop essay on complexity, three years ago,craving for more development on artificial life, etc... but I found the book confusing, shallow."
2,"Fun, but misleading","Gleick does indeed cover some very difficult material in a very readable way. However, he misrepresents some of the ideas dangerously. The book is full of hero worship and idolization of the scientists he writes about, and he comes across sounding like Moses come down from the mountain carrying the stone tablets of chaos theory. In the end, the facts are right, but the interpretation would make any of the scientists he describes grimace."
4,"A ""must"" if you strive to understand the mystery of the universe","No, this book won't change your life or anything, but if you're an enthusiastic reader of lay science books, like me, it's a must read. Gleick's style can get dense and repetitive at times, but the concepts that he is conveying are slippery, at best. It's hard to get an intellectual bead on them. So the repetition is appropriate.And if you've ever wondered how in the universe order could evolve out of chaos, this book gives us a peak at the best clues there are to what lies behind the kimono."
5,Brilliant,"This is another excellent book from Gleick, surely one of the best writers alive right now."
5,This is a fine piece of science writing,"This book not only gives historical perspective about the development of chaos theory, but also gives the non-specialist and educated layman a glimpse of how science is done, and the motivations of scientists. James Gleick has done a very good job of explaining important ideas without sophisticated mathematics. This is especially important as one cannot understand the material much better than is presented here without some measure of exposure to topological ideas."
3,Tough going,Good book but hard going.Well researched but but more technical than I was looking for.Ended up skimming through this book.Thanks
4,Chaos by James Gleick,"As usual, James Gleick has a way of making the most arcane and complex ideas in contemporary science, accessible to a layperson. However, rather than coming over like a textbook in Science 101, he is eminently readable. There is a narrative momentum that simply sweeps you along the path that winds through the dense undergrowth of arcane ideas, with James as your personal guide.In my opinion, he is simply one of the best science writers of our generation."
3,not overly interesting,"i was expecting something much more technical than what was delivered. Gleick goes into the story about the creation of the science of chaos without giving any explanation of actual discoveries: most of the chapters read 'and then (x) discovered something really amazing, and i won't bother to really develop it... on to the next guy'. it could have been so much better."
5,gorgeous plate,My plates came packaged well and they are absolutely beautiful. I would def reccomend them to others
3,Not the best.,"I didn't actually notice a difference in the bumps when using this, though it was a lot less intense than the ointments. My skin is already dry so I was hoping this would do the trick and help me avoid flaky skin. I guess I'll keep looking for the right product, and in the meantime, the ladies ointment formula is much less intense than the regular formula and much more effective on sensitive spots like your face and bikini area with a lot less irritation. I've switched guys to it as well, so it's worth a shot if you're struggling."
1,Dries Skin Out,"Do not use this product! It is painful when you apply it, and it dries the skin out because of the alcohol in it, which will only worsen ingrown hairs! The skin on my chin, where all the hair is, after about a week of use, became so dry that my skin looked scaly with all the dead, dry skin on it."
4,Awesome!,This is an awesome game. I just recently started playing Guild Wars and I find the games very easy to get used to for someone who has never played. I like the fact that it is free to play online. I would definitely recommend this game to others.
3,"good game, poor extras","the game is excellent and the graphics are cool. What dissapointed me are all the extras,(map, poster etc.)they are of poor quality and actually it looks they only put them to get more money. I know that's the point of any special edition, but I would like to see someting better for the extra money."
4,Guild Wars Factions,The 2nd Installment is almost as fun as the first. Graphics are awesome. Could do with out all the NPC's constant talking before missions/quests start.
1,"Zondervan NIV Study Bible, Large Print","The site describes Bible as LEATHER BOUND when it is BONDED LEATHER. There is a big difference. Red letter is very light - should be called pink letter. Black print also light and hard to read. Print from back side of page shows thru.NOT A BIBLE I WOULD RECOMMEND for a senior citizen or anyone who wants easy on the eyes reading.The OLD Zondervan Study Bible, large print was easy to read.Red print was red print. Black print was black. No shadow of back side of page showing thru. Find it!!"
5,A very good translation done the right way.,"This bible translation was done the right way, by a broad range of bible scholars from the earliest known writings. It has been said the scripture should be translated every 200 years in todays language. This translation has done it without bias from any source. I would highly recommend it."
2,Great images but limited narrative,"This book has some great images of Winchester collector items but the actual narrative is quite limited. The book also includes prices of the pictured items but I would suggest that you take them with a grain of salt. In fact, as many of the images are from the author's own collection it appears that he is simply attempting to raise the value of his collection by inflating the suggested prices."
4,A must for those considering visiting the colorful Caribbean,"Fielding's Caribbean"" is an great guide to 31 island nations - I have found no other handbook that clearly and concisely lays out the important information that a traveler needs as well as Fielding's does. The ratings are accurate, and most of the better properties and restaurants on each island are included.While this guide is highly recommended, it has a few shortcomings that need to be mentioned. Most notable is that Fielding's does not think of Cuba as part of the Caribbean, and there is no coverage of this country at all.Second, the lack of web sites or e-mail addresses ...today, most hotels have e-mail and web sites, which make booking a reservation easy and cheap.Despite these omissions, ""Fielding's Caribbean"" is a must for those considering visiting the colorful and exotic world of the Caribbean."
5,the best !,"this album even though its 12 years old is still untouchable by the so called greats of today and even if travis etc. are still going in another 12 years they still won t write songs as good as she bangs the drums,adorded,this is the one or even don t stop! 10 out of 10"
3,blood and guts and gore..love it :),"the best and weirdestest c rated film of all time..its one of those weird and wacky movies someone came up with for revenge to make it with a handheld camcorder, low on budget money, and with a good twist... since i havent seen this movie since i was like 9 or 10, i cant believe i found this movie for my best friend and i on my favorite website i shop for almost everything on..thanks amazon for letting me find the movie ive been lookin for...for years :)"
2,"Good idea, but needs improvements","Bad acting at the start and Sally chasing the blond girl through the woods was annoying, the girl was too loud, not her fault just bad audio work. I could barely hear Sally over the girls screams. The other screams and yells were extremely loud aswellSally is a librarian who will kick your butt for returning a late book or do her wrong. Its a well written movie, just some bad acting and audio work ruined it for me. I am also surprised by the amount of gorgeous women in the film. Where did they find them for a low budget film?"
4,Great fun,"I LOVED this movie!! It had shoddy production values - the acting spanned the whole spectrum from passable to awful - but I LOVED it. I laughed like an idiot through most of it, and everyone in the room agreed that if Sally were our local librarian / psycho-killer - we'd totally hang out with her! I'm actually thinking of purchasing this one - It'll become a ""cult classic"" with my group of friends at least.If you like your films to be funny, gory and loopy, this is for you!"
1,Dreadful!!,"Seriously folks, don't waist your time! Don't be fooled by one of the quoteson the front cover ""Destined to become a cult classic!"" O'k., the plot was do able, but the acting, make-up and camera work were juvenile. I was very disappointed, and I don't disappoint very easily."
1,CHAINSAW HYPE SALLY,"Ok first of all any filmaker who has enough money can get Herschell gordon lewis to do a cameo in their film, and anyone who has enough money can pay for a buch of full page ads in fangoria magazine, hence chainsaw sally all hype,yes its a cool name for a flick and a character, Jimmy o the director did come up with a cool idea and starred his wife April to play the part, Now hes doing the Chainsaw sally show and paying People like Debbie rochon to come aboard and all of a sudden this april burrell is supposed to get a free pass to scream queen stardom please, this movie stinks, she cant act, and the hype is just ridiculous my recomendation is dont be a sheeple people dont waste your time but if you do dont say i didnt warn ya!"
2,NOT THAT GOOD,"I LOVE A LOT OF B MOVIE HORROR,BUT THIS NOT THAT GREAT.I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER HAVING GUNNER HANSON IN IT,AND GORDON LEWIS,THE STORY LINE WAS OK.THE GORE WASNT THERE,LITTLE SCEENS OF IT.AGAIN I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE(SHOCKORAMA)ANYWAYS IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT GETTING IT,I WOULD FIRST RENT IT.SEE IF YOU LIKE IT,I WOULDNT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FULL PRICE DVD.THE MUSIC SCORE WAS COOL FOR SURE."
5,Great product,"My husband loves this product. It does the job without any pain, and it is compact and easy to use."
5,Great Book,"This book is great and very new! Very low price too! Shipment is fast, it takes only 4 days from US to Canada."
4,Thorough coverage of research on human factors engineering,"Wickens & Hollands cover human factors (which they call engineering psychology in their title) thoroughly in this volume. If you found Donald Norman's ""The Psychology of Everyday Things,"" useful, but want something more in-depth, you may find this academic textbook useful. It covers a great deal of research on several topics critical to software user interface design, such as, attention & perception, spatial displays, memory & training, and decision-making."
1,1002 ways,The 1002 way is don't support this guy by buying his book. Whatever happened to old fashioned common sense? that we need some guy to rattle off 1001 expenses we can cut.
1,Not worth it,"I don't usually spend my time writing reviews, but after purchasing this book from a thrift store, I had to warn others.I am always looking for books to teach me more ways to be frugal. I thought that with 1001 tips, there may be something for me to use.Yikes. I couldn't even read the whole thing. When I read Marry someone rich, and Use your vacuum bags three times, I gave up.While this may help people who never heard of the term frugal, for others who naturally practice frugality, the book is a waste of time."
1,Tip # 1 To Save Money............,Tip # 1 is save your money and DO NOT buy this book! One of the ideas is to get a goat for milk!! Don't you then have to buy grain to feed the goat? Another tip: Don't bring your children food shopping. Hiring a babysitter is cheaper???
1,What a crock!,"This book started off well, but it never delivered. I am NOT going to re-use my trash bags to save money - come on! My tip to save money: Don't buy this book."
2,footstool arrived in peices,Product fell apart when it was taken out of the box. There were no fasteners so it was necessary to glue it together like it was a kit. I emailed the mamnufacturer to alert them of the problem but never received a response.The ad claimed the item retailed for nearly $100 and was heavily discounted. Examination of the footstool reveals a cheap piece of overseas furnature worth about $20.I don't recommend this prioduct to anyone.
3,seperating,the item is ok except i have to reglue the jointsi should of returned but it was a christmas gift so had no time to return
1,Fell apart,"The stool fell apart the second time I tried to use it as a foot stool. It is only stapled together,not nailed."
1,fell apart,I purchased the stool for my Mother who is in a nursing home. She needed a stool so she could place her leg on it because she had a stroke and her leg needs to be elevated. My Mom had the stool two days and call me to tell me the stool fell apart. I had too bring the stool home and use gorilla glue to assemble it back together. I am no sure if this is going to work yet because she has the stool now for one day. I am very disappointed the stool was not worth the money and was made very cheap
1,"i'll say it: ""junk""","This small stool was falling apart when I pulled it from the box. There is no glue to be seen on any of the joints, and the sides are held together with staples across the corner joints on the bottom. I wouldn't trust this to sit on it or stand on it... in fact, I'm not sure I'd trust it to be knocked over without falling apart. Hard to believe how badly it's made. I'll try and attach pictures to the product page."
3,Queen Anne Footstool,"This item was difficult to assemble and it is not as sturdy as we would have liked. We finally had to glue it together as the screws which should have held it together were inadequate. In past years we've ordered stools of this type which came assembled with screw-in legs. They were much better than this type of stool. Another type we've ordered had the legs already attached to the base. These were the sturdiest. I doubt that I'd buy this type again! On this item at least, the vendor was excellent in delivering as promised."
5,Good Quailty Product,Very good quality for the price. The footstool was securely packaged and all that was required for assembly was to screw in the four legs. My wife is very pleased with the purchase.
3,One thing missing,This stool is well made and cute. But it is TINY. Be sure to measure before ordering. My fault that I did not do that but the thing I don't like about this foot stool is that it comes without any pads for the bottom of the legs. If you want to use on hardwood floors and not leave marks then you have to go purchase felt pads. For the price I would have expected them to come with it.
1,Very disappointed,"I had a difficult time finding this item; it was to replace a footstool I've had for several years that broke recently. I really liked and used my original item; this one was a real disappointment. The design was ok, but the frame appeared to have been broken (or simply came unglued) and was repaired with what looked like foam insulation! There was a glop of white foam along the base of the box which ran along the side -- very obvious against the dark cherry stain. There was another glop on the inside top of the box. I tried picking at it with a fingernail, but it would take something like a chisel to remove it and I didn't want to damage the finish or the wood. It's going back -- I emailed the company immediately.The only redeeming feature is that customer service has been wonderful; I was extremely unhappy with their product and the customer service center has been very helpful in processing my return."
3,disappointed,I thought I was getting a footstoll not one literally for one foot. This is so small!!! The storage box inside of the stoll is about as big as a sheet of notebook paper! I guess I should have really looked at the dimensions more closely.
3,A mixed review,Looks great when done. Clever construction but hard to put together and needed wood glue to hold it securely when assembled. Instructions were for a different product so they were useless.
2,Too tall,I purchased this item and shipped to my parents out of state so I never saw it in person. On line it looked perfect and the reviews were good however it was taller than I thought and not what I wanted. I thought it was like a true old fashioned foot stool which sits very low to the floor. I returned it.
3,UNSTABLE,"These foot stools are very nice looking and easy to put together. However, they fall apart easily. I have not been able to use them (I bought 3) because I have to get some Elmers Glue to re-build them and hopefully they will not fall apart."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Do yourself a favor, avoid this movie like the plague. This is an awful, awful movie, no story, really bad acting. Avoid this piece of garbage."
1,THIS BOOK IS BEING PUBLISHED WITHOUT PERMISSION & FALSELY REPRESENTED,"My father, Robert Cole, IS THE ONLY AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK, THE BOOK OF HOUSES! IT IS BEING PUBLISHED WITHOUT MY PERMISSION AND I HOLD ALL RIGHTS TO THIS BOOK! THE CO-AUTHOR LISTED WAS MY FATHER'S ASSISTANT AND I HAVE THE ORIGINAL TRANSCRIPTS AND COPIES OF THE BOOK TO PROVE IT! I AM CURRENTLY SEEKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST ALL PARTIES DISTRIBUTING, SELLING, OR PURCHASING THIS BOOK! PLEASE DO NOT DISHONOR MY FATHER'S MEMORY AND TAKE A STAND AGAINST THOSE IN HIS LIFE THAT HAVE CHOSEN TO PROFIT OFF OF HIS LIFE'S WORK!!! THANK YOU-KRISTEN JOHNSON"
2,Essay on Forgiving,"Typically a relating of horror stories that prompted forgiveness. Personally I wasn't looking for theory or sermonizing but more of a ""how to"" do it."
5,LIFE CHANGING,I've lost count of the many books I have read about forgiveness. This one changed my life and brought new insight and sensitivity to my own teaching on the subject! I strongly recommend it and acknowledge Professor Worthington as one of the best writers on the subject living in our day!
5,Even better than the first!!!!,"Ms. Blackstock did a fantastic job with this, the second book in the series. It kept me reading late into the night. The promotion of compassion over our personal ""rights"" is what the Gospel is all about, and she wrapped the concept around a delightful story line that raises the ante on what she started with book one. A definite must read!!!"
5,Inspirational,This first book in the series makes you really think about your self and how you would react if put in their situation. I know we depend way too much on the technologies that we are fortunate to have. I found myself wanting to learn things just like they did in the book that would help the situation. I really enjoyed this series and would encourage others to read it. It was a great reality check. Thanks to the writter of this series I really enjoyed it.
5,"Great book, very entertaining, couldn't put it down!","I loved this book, it was captivating and very easy to read. I enjoyed it immensely, and would recommend it to anyone, as well as the others in the series. I also love that it is written by a Christian author, Terri Blackstock is amazing!"
5,Fantastic!!!,This was a terrific book! Very spiritually convicting and just overall amazing! Terri Blackstock always keeps you on edgeCAUTION: very suspenseful!
5,A Great Follow-up,"Spellbinding and interesting! Safe to listen to with older kids in the car too! Love the fact that the family is living out their faith and that the daughter struggles with being bound to a non-believer. We couldn't wait to get back in the car and hear what was next. (Caution: a few scenes have drug use, gun use)"
2,A good faith story ... but not suspense,"I picked up this book because it was marketed as a suspense book. I have no prior experience with Blackstock's writing. From this perspective, I was extremely disappointed. I didn't find the story line suspenseful in the least. In fact, it was syrupy and predictable. The good people do good things and get their rewards, the bad people do bad things and get their just desserts.As a book about faith in the face of adversity, it was pretty good. If I had been expecting a story about how Bible scripture can help us deal with seemingly overwhelming circumstances, I would have been very pleased with this story. I think the story would have been more interesting if some of the characters had been faced with true moral dilemmas, though, or if there were some elements of surprise or interesting plot twists."
5,Night Light by Terry Blackstock,This book showed up in 'like new' condition as promised. The seller was wonderful and prompt in shipping. Thank you.
5,Night light (a restoration novel),Night light a restoration novel series Totally kept me wanting to read more! I loved the suspense and the intrigue . I've downloaded all of this series!
3,night light,"certainly made me think, most of us cannot imagine life without electricity, but here we have people who learn to manage. I don't think I would have done as well as them."
5,Excellent Hands-On Preparation,"The labs in this book are really helpful. Not like a dry exam prep book -- you learn by doing. The real-world examples are realistic, stuff that you'll find on the job. Its a great test prep!"
3,Too small,The scuffs would be fine except for the size. The 'large' is really 'medium' - anyone ove a ten (US) may find them tight and short.
3,Misrepresented Sizing,"My 10 1/2 size feet just barely fit on the foot beds, though ""XL"" is supposed to fit size 12-13. Other slippers ordered also ran small. Misrepresented sizing is a big problem for on line shoppers. Slipper provides adequate though not great comfort, and is a little tall inside, meaning it will likely be hard to keep from slipping off. I'll keep them out of desperation and because I'm already returning another pair (Sorel), but I'm disappointed."
3,A little too short,"It would be nice if they made different sizes besides the generic small, medium, and large because these slippers are soooo comfy, until you walk for a little bit. If you are a 10 or smaller you might enjoy these but I wouldn't get them off the internet for the shortness liability. I've had them for 10 months and with heavy use they are in great shape. But now my search for a copycat with a longer sole begins! Vaya con dios!!!"
4,Great Product!,"Overall these are great quality slippers. My only complaint is that the sole is a little bit too wide all around and very ""sticky"" when walking on carpet, which can sometimes cause the ""user"" to trip, especially if you like dragging your feet. LOL"
2,Lining started to come out after 2 days,I was excited to get these. Out of the box the quality looks great. Unfortunately after only 2 days of wear big clumps of wool started coming out. Now there are wear spots that have no wool.
1,A Travesty!,"Generally, you would think that authors, especially reputed ones such as Josepha Sherman, would actually watch an episode of a show they were doing a tie-in novel of. Not so in this case. Sherman's complete lack of understanding of the Andromeda universe, from the absence of the Eureka Maru, to the fact that the crew was reduced to a collection of cardboard and sound-bytes, with a plot that's been done to death, this was perhaps the worst of any of the tie-in novels that I've seen come out from TOR or Tribune. In fact, it reads like it was written by using a search-and-replace treatment from a generic ""Star Trek"" novel, before they started making the effort they have of late. Given that this book followed ""Waystation,"" which was thoroughly researched and actually captured the flavour of the series, it makes this book all that much more of an appalling, hollow sham of what tie-in novels should be."
5,Prof Winner's insights on technology are winners indeed!,"A fascinating read. Thoughtful, intriguing, insightful. Professor Winner's book investigates the impact technology is having on our society in ways you are not likely to have previously considered.My reaction was the same as I had when first exposed to Emerson's writings: ""Hey, he's absolutely right! Why hadn't I thought of that? It's so obvious -- now that he's connected the dots for me.""If this topic interests you at all, and it should given that you utilize the web to search for good books, you will absolutely fall in love with this book. Guaranteed."
3,Missed Oppurtunity,"It is great that they finally released one of my favorite series on DVD, but Shout Factory could of done so much better with these releases. Take the time clean them up a bit and digitally remaster them. I'd give the video quality a C due to the fact at times you can see pixelation in the U.S. scenes. The combination of the grain naturally there from the Japanese scenes and the pixelation makes these scenes look terrible. As far as audio it gets a B. My suggestion to Shout Factory in the future take a page from the Doctor Who Restoration team on how to bring a classic to DVD. Limit the episodes to six a disc. Its sad when Millcreek could of put out a better release."
5,YAY!,It's about time they put this on DVD! I am hoping I will be able to get it! The best power rangers ever!
5,The best thing that happened in my life this year,"I am a lover of all things with cheesy giant monsters trying for world domination (of course!) and when I saw this at Walmart last night after work I knew I had to buy it without even considering my razor thin finances. The cover art is even better than the UK dvd release which is absurdly overpriced and no one is even going to bother with that version now. Now that Shout Factory has released Power Rangers, and earlier this year Underdog, if they can release my FAVORITE Saturday morning cartoon of all time on DVD ""Beetlejuice; the animated series"" Shout Factory will be my hero!"
5,I'm ready,"I'm old, have a wife, and i'm working 60 hours a week. 21 and I'm soooo tired I look 37. I've waited since I was like 12 for this to be released... 9 years later .......................................................................................And boy it was about time!!!!Pre-ordered 1 day shipping! I needed this,my life will soon be complete. After seeing the green/white ranger at Comic-con I thought life wasn't going to get better. But boy i'm happy to be wrong!I'll be buying this with a red ranger figure and I don't give a damn what anyone says, this was the best dang show of my childhood!I'm tearing up as I write this, it feels bitter-sweet to wait soo long to taste this, but feels awesome to finally get this. Ah racist Zordon..... I was too innocent back then now i'll be giggling everytime I see Zack and Rebecca, then later see them switch colors with Adam and Aisha.GOOD TIMES! Hope every fan gets their copy."
5,I THINK I'M GOING TO FAINT.,"After 10,000 years The Mighty Morphin Power Ranger are free! Not free as in you don't have to pay for it. Free as in finally allowed to be released on dvd. I constantly looked for this for almost a decade and gave up a couple years ago. I stumbled on this doing a Lost In Space search. Usually when a dvd says season something, volume something you get one lousy disc with 3 to 4 episodes, if you're lucky. Not with this though. You get 3 discs with a whopping 30, count them 30 episodes. It was my son who got me into this by insisting I sit and watch this with him when it was on tv when he was 7 years old. I miss him so much. He would have been 25 years old this year, and I'm sure he would have loved watching this with me."
5,Unexpected Early Arrival.,It was said that it would be released tomorrow. But I received the DVD today. That was the earliest DVD I received before its official release date.
5,About Time,"I was around 11-12 yrs old when this show first aired. From episode one I was hooked, I am so glad these are FINALLY being released on dvd. I've owned the region 2 sets for awhile now. This release will contain the first 30 episodes."
3,Yes on Netflix but not all episodes after they turn into kids second time,Yes I am guilty of watching on netflix thinking it would never come out on DVD. However after Rita's father turns back time first episode the episodes are not all there. The way by buying DVD we are certain to get all of the entirely and scenes in correct order. Also I never got see truly see if bulk and skull stayed monkeys or were changed back into to humans or not ever but in the turbo movie they were a little not in the head. Maybe the movie turbo was written separate from show like the first one was as well.
4,It's Morphin Time! I wish the quality was better though.,"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is awesome. It was basically my childhood--I was 6 when I saw the very first episode on TV. Seeing the show make its debut on Netflix last year gave me agreat amount of hope for a DVD release in great quality.However, upon picking up my Volume 1 DVD today I found myself disappointed with the quality of the image... on a high-def display anyway. On my 40"" LCD the image comes in as choppy or blurry at times. In its defense, I can accept that older programs won't look as good on a newer TV. I wasn't expecting it to look like a blu-ray or anything, but I thought it would look slightly better than this.That's just my opinion, anyway. At the end of the day, I'm just glad I have some of the original Power Rangers episodes on DVD finally. This is an amazing value for anyone who grew up with the series like I did. Just don't expect it to look amazing on your HDTV."
5,Beyond excited!,"Can't wait for this to be released. It'll bring back such good childhood memories! I haven't seen these since I was a kid, it'll be nice to be able to watch it again."
3,2 year lifespan,"I've owned t-fal for many years and have found that the average set of pans, with regular use, last about 2-3 years. They are great non-stick pans and you can always buy a replacement frying pan at Target, but the downside is that I have not found replacement saucepans (which I use the most). They are worth the money you pay for them since they only last a few years. But if you're looking for something for a lifetime...try something else."
3,Okay set,"I love this cookware set, the sizes of all the pans are great! The only things I don't like, are the lids for the saucepans. They are hard to clean and the top of the handle comes off all the time.Update Sept. 2011: they are not durable at all. We got rid of the frying pans after about a year and the saucepans aren't looking good either. I expected better from T-fal."
4,Intrigue at the Cleaners,I really enjoyed this second of the Mandy Dyer series & hope Dolores Johnson keeps writing more. Who knew there was so much going on at your local dry cleaners? Her books are funny-witty & a good read not to mention spot-less. This time we get to meet Mandys Mom & she is a hoot. Looking forward to the next installment.
5,HUNG UP TO DIE,"THIS ENTRY IN THE SERIES BY THIS AUTHOR IS ANOTHER FUN READ. IF YOU FOLLOW THE SERIES, YOU GET TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT."
1,There are better for cheaper.,"The triports are a good headphone in the $50 range. Unfortunately they cost three times that. For $150 there are much better sounding headphones to be had. Sony V6 or 7506 (same headphone) are good, the AKG 240 are good too. Sennheiser makes some great cans at all headphone levels. And all of these eheadphones are more study than the triports. There are forums online for headphones if you want more reviews or ideas. Shop around and you'll get a better pair for it."
2,Great sound & comfort; terrible construction,"I bought these because of the comfort and sound, both of which I really like. I have a hard time wearing headphones and can't wear earbuds at all, so the lightweight design of these were very comfortable for me. The sound quality is very good in my opinion.However, I agree with the reviewer that these are poorly made. Within a few weeks of owning them, mine also broke at the headband (where you adjust them to fit your head). Frustrated, I taped this up. Since that time, everything that could break on these headphones have broken. The headband is now broken on both sides and the headphones have broken at their swivel points. I've been using them all taped up, but they no longer swivel to fit close against my head. And, it is really frustrating to pay that much money for something that is of such poor quality."
2,"Great sound, lousy build quality","I purchased these about one year ago. The sound was pretty good. However, while taking these headphones off both sides cracked and two pieces of metal dug into my head, ouch! I would try some other brand."
1,ABYSMAL,"...for sound-deadening these are kinda sorta OK, they manage to reduce maybe 40% of ambient noise.For music though they are an unmitigated DISASTER!!! I was so much happier with my Sennheisers, and even my cheap $20 Sonys had better sound reproduction than this.I knew I should have listened to all my audiophile friends who call Bose ""the greatest marketing scam in audio."""
2,EXTREME COMFORT---POOR SOUND!,"I used to think that more expensive meant better, but no longer! I gave it (1) star for comfort and (1) star for being light weight. If you're a ""Rocker"" like me, you'll be greatly disappointed with the lack of Bass Response. I recommend getting the lower priced Koss Porta Pro's, the Sennheiser 212's, Sony MDV-6's and/or the Grado SR225's. All these have way better Bass Response and are just overall better. I really regret wasting my money on the Bose headphones."
1,Mine broke too,"After about a year of occasional use, the right side broke off. Yes, the sound quality is good, but the a random $20 AIWA from best buy sound as good attached to my IPod. Not sure why I paid $150 for these. Stupid me !"
1,Poor Construction - Awesome Sound,"Don't waste your money on these until Bose improves the construction material quality!If I could rate the construction separate from the sound quality the rating would be like this: Construction=0, Sound=5. The sound quality rocks, but they fall apart after using only a few times. I use these at my desk. They never go anywhere else, and the head band broke on both sides where you adjust the size to fit your head (using tape to hold together), and then the left one completely fell off (I couldn't tape it together like the head band part), so now I only have a one sided headphone. I'm really shocked at the poor quality. By something else until Bose gets their act together."
2,Light weight and breakable,"Be aware that anytime you remove these headphones with one hand they will break. They sound ok but are built very cheaply. My set lasted only a few uses. I replaced them with a $20 set of headphones from Radio Shack that said KOSS ""Titanium"" on the package and they sound so much better it is hard to believe."
2,"Great band , weak album","This is not a good album. It is fair at best. And it was a major disappointment at the time it was released, following the classic rockers, No Rest for the Wicked and Walkin' the Razor's Edge. If you made a true ""Best Of"" for Helix, nothing on this album would qualify, although Deep Cuts the Knife would probably have to be included because it was their biggest hit. I don't know whether the band was just burnt out or whether they tried too hard to become stars. It was probably both, since there are three slower songs on this one and even the rockers are lame and generic. Fortunately, they came back with the full-throttle blast of Wild In the Streets. And if you want a more laid-back Helix, get Back for Another Taste, which is far superior to this collection of schlock."
3,No-Tail Foxy toy,"This toy was expensive! We bought the fox one and it was cute, but it no longer has a tail. And the squeaker did not last long at all. Not a good buy for a puppy that likes to chew ... latex is much better."
1,OBVIOUS PLAGIARISM!!!!! WHAT CRAP!!!!!! AT LEAST CREDIT!!,This author is an obvious plagiarist and parents should keep their kids away from such immoral writers. Teach your kids to respect authors both in the US and abroad!!Here is the original:The Little Witchby Otfried PreusslerPlease have the decency to appreciate the real brilliance behind wonderful stories rather than reading this cheap ripoff. Too bad the english translation of the above book is lacking. Maybe this author could have helped translate Preusller's work rather than simply ripping off the material.No ignorance is not bliss and teaching our kids plagiarism is WRONG! no matter how you might try to explain it.
3,Average Chapter book,"This book has color illustrations throughout the book. The text is a bit more conicse due to the artwork. The book is simple enough for a first grader at the chapter book level - and demonstrated a progression through the story that they are able to keep up with and understand.I think there are better, funnier chapter books out there."
5,The Witch who was Afraid of Witches,"My boys and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was very well written and the illustrations are wonderful. Full of detail and color. It was not scary as a lot of Halloween books are so my 4 year old enjoyed it very much. I loved that I could read it with both my 4 and 6 year old and while they enjoyed it, my husband and I also enjoyed it. We read this every night for a few weeks until I finally put it away with the Halloween decorations."
4,my 4-year old daughter loved it,"Though she's most often dressed as a princess, my daughter enjoyed this book so much that she wore a black witch's cape with her sleeping beauty costume on halloween. She liked the role-playing (we pretended to be witches in the book and mix evil brews and cast spells on her unsuspecting father) and she seemed to understand the underlying message of the importance of believing in oneself."
4,WELL SATISFIED,THESE GOT A HIGH RATING BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY WELL MADE.I LOVE THESE BECAUSE OF THEIR LOOKS AND DURABILITY..RECOMMEND TO ALL...freddy
3,cheap step,"This step does the trick for me and is the cheapest I could find.Be very careful when you drill into the car body. On the driver's side I found that there are some wires running in the channel you have to drill through - get those out of the way first or you will be chasing shorts for a while. Also, the bolts delivered with this product were flimsy - just broke off. I replaced them with better ones of the same size."
3,***Buyer be warned: May not be an easy install. ***,"Before you jump into this purchase, be careful to understand that this product might not just bolt on to your vehicle.I bought this step for my 96 Dodge Ram and was surprised to discover that mounting it required drilling through metal and some creative thinking on my part.You'll need to tighten all the bolts down with power tools if you want this step to hold any weight.Finally, this step gets slippery when wet. I recommend applying some skateboard grip tape to amend this.Other than that, it works."
1,La Reina Of What Pueblo?,"maybe a pueblo where people have heard only her music. She is no queen. I hate this CD, is very boring and her voice is very annoying."
2,Questions not reflective of AANP exam content,"While I was using this book to prep for my AANP exam, I kept thinking to myself that the questions in this book were not like the questions I had seen in other preparatory courses and books. The sample questions go into such minutia and are not reflective of broader concepts and critical thinking that are needed for the exam. Also, there were quite a few mistakes and typos in the book. Perhaps this book is more reflective of the ANCC exam content...but I doubt it. The disc was OK, some of the test questions on the disc did not go into great rationales for correct and incorrect answers. Fitzgerald's review materials are much better and far more reflective of exam content."
2,Dated material,"The format is user-friendly. I, too, found mistakes and rationales that at times contradicted the right answer! I am not sure if this is sloppy editing, or what, but it is not desirable in board review materials. My chief complaint is that much of the material seems dated. When exactly was this 2nd edition published? In the state (AZ) where I'll be practicing, NPs have prescriptive powers. There are answers such as, ""Have the physician prescribe . . . . "" Some of the material addressing thyroid disease seems a bit out of keeping with current guidelines and the Peds section does not seem to follow current CDC guidelines for immunizations. I think they have a good thing going here, but they need to update the material periodically."
4,Great adjunct review text,"When it comes to review books, sometimes it's good to have a few different ones just in terms of covering subject content.This book had good content and rationales for answers, plus doing practice tests with the CD-ROM was very helpful. However, sometimes the questions were confusing and could have been better worded or structured.On the whole, I wouldn't use this as my main review text but it was helpful nonetheless."
4,Awesome Timing,"This book arrived in great condition, but the best part is that it arrived within 2 working days of my order when it was projected for 4 weeks. I really appreciate that! It arrived in time for me to use it to study for my exam. Thank you so much."
2,I do not feel that a lot of thought went into this book.,"I am currently studying for the certification and feel that this book does one thing well, that is forcing you to buy another review book. The Emergency review section is 10 questions on bug bites. What about emergency fluid and electrolyte, Burn or, 12 lead EKG reviews? The test taking skills section was rudamentary. I really feel cheated for my money."
2,not worth it,"not the best buy i have ever donevary cheaply madebut will worknot worth the price,maybe 1/2 the cost."
3,"OK product, not entirely what I expected","Easy to put together.... REALLY easy. But for some reason I thought it was white in the photo. It is not... It is more like beige.Looks ok, but not worth the price in my opinion (basically plastic, snap together box). Worth $25-30 in my opinion.Won't buy it again, but also won't return it. Too complicated. It's fine. So if you are looking for ""fine""..... you are good. :-)"
4,Sturdy Little Storage Seat,"I bought the mini seat to have on my roof deck for storage and not have it take up useless space. The chair is sturdy enough to sit on, not too comfy, but a cushion or two could help it. The storage is enough for all our grill stuff, and sunscreens, etc. A storm came by last week which sent everything flying all over, one chair ended up on top of the railing, and even thought the mini seat traveled across the entire roof, it didn't come apart, it held together. We had a storage bench a few years ago that seemed study, but blew apart and ended up in the alley. This one is sturdier than it looks."
4,"Very nice, good price","I did not quite believe the ""easy assembly"" description for this item but it really was true. A very nice product too - sturdy, handy, nice looking and even comfotable to sit on. I only stopped at 4 stars as I do not know yet how waterproof or durable it will prove to be."
4,HDMI wall outlet,Works well with no complaints about it. Pigtail is actually useful for instal in confined spaces. Installation not difficult. Drywall know-how is a plus.
2,So So quality,These wall plates degrade the signal quality significantly. Ok to use if the cable is 6 feet but not if 25 feet.
3,Doesn't fit in a standard wall box,"Can't comment on whether the product works or not, just want others to be aware it does not fit inside of a standard gang box. Would probably be OK otherwise."
2,Weak,"With the exception of his columbian hitman this album was rather boring. The ripping off of quotes from the Alcoholic Anonymous Big Book were at first a refreshing blast from what modern music has become, (Namely rap) but this excitement was short lived upon finding out that the artists sport a link to Jagermeister's website on their own. Hrmm.. I think they are trying to catch a seemingly fading market of tattooed still rocking straightXedges. Or maybe, being a hypocrite is acceptable north of the border. Ok.. I must make amends for that last statement. Hehhe..."
2,I think the DOPE got to them???,"This album is weak. For some reason, they want to be sellouts like new KoRn or other fashioncore bands. I was a HUGE fan of their last album but noticed them hinting toward this change. They've gone completely under. My recommendation: stay away from this album and get Inches from the Mainline. If you have that, check out Mudvayne. They're not compeletely sellouts yet like these guys are"
3,Decent sell-out attempt,"I don't have much to say about this album. It's just ho-hum. I wouldn't recommend it, nor would I advise someone against it.I will say that I was a huge fan of their song Light On Your Feet, which they released on a demo before Inches From The Mainline came out, so I welcomed a softer approach (not that I disliked Inches...). But this album just doesn't have ""it"". At no point am I ever impressed with any aspect of this album. The lyrics are okay at best, the music's pretty much standard fare for the genre and the overall feel is just kinda ""eh"".Pick up this album if you enjoyed works by Stereomud or Darwin's Waiting Room, although if you're not a huge fan of the harder-Nu Metal, then I wouldn't suggest bothering."
1,What happened to this band?,"If anyone is familiar with their older stuff, they will be highly disappointed. They got way lighter!! strictly alternative. Besides that, their music is way too cliché of everything else. They sounded original once, now they sound like everyone one else. With the exception of ""Caffeine Love Affair"" and ""Columbian Ascot"" this albums pretty bad. songs are long and very repetitive. After he says the same word 25 times in a row you will be ready to kick your cd player! I took my copy back to the store!"
2,Very Weak Album,"The Slaves on Dope that we've come to love is gone, and they're back with a more mainstream, soft affair. Now, SOD was a very good band while at their heaviest; however, unlike bands like Spineshank and Dope, they cannot make a heavy CD and have a good comeback with a softer CD. There are only two standout tracks on the whole album, ""September"", in which they sucessfully harness the emotion their grasping for on the rest of the tracks, and ""Caffeine Love Affair"", one of the only resemblences to ""Inches From The Mainline"". The rest of the tracks are dull, repeatitive, sound alike, etc. Jason Rockman, the vocalist, offers nothing new to the world of singing, while neither do the musicians. If you're looking for something new, something original, or something good, check out ""Inches From The MAinline"". Thanks."
3,Staind?,"This sounds like Staind, Nickelback, etc. It's good but not original. Go get it if you like this kind of stuff."
2,What happened to this band........,"I absoultely loved their debut cd, ""Inches from the Mainline,"" so when I heard they were going for a more mellow sound, I was a bit weary. Many bands decide to take that route, and many pull it off rather well. Unfortunately, Slaves on Dope should NEVER try to make this type of music again. This cd was horrible to the point that I don't even enjoy listening to it. The lead singer can't pull off melody like other transition bands such as Endo or Ill Nino, and he just sounds ridiculous trying. The ferocity that he carried on the first cd is almost completely absent, save for a few tracks toward the end of the cd which sound like mediocre b-sides to ""Mainline."" Shame on you Slaves on Dope."
2,Metafour,"This new cd by Slaves on dope is much better than their last one. There are some really good songs, but they need to settle down bit more. Once they do this, slaves on dope can show us their true potential. Overall this cd is pretty good, but it could be better."
1,Picture and reviews wrong.,"We received the item named in the title of this toy, Mini No Ends 100 piece set, which is a set of tubes and connectors, and NOT a marble run as pictured or as described by any of the reviewers. There appears to be a marble run available, but not on this item page."
4,A nice reference book,"It is a nice reference book for beginners as well as intermediate. It does not go into too much detail to overwhelm someone new to it, but has enough information to keep an intermediate interested. It also has some sample spells, to get the beginner going."
5,Very Pleased,"I liked the candle layouts in this little book. I found the candle magic to be more serious minded than in other books I have read on the subject. Not many spells, but they cover the basics. I am glad I purchased this book."
3,"Does the job, but that's about it.","Got one of these when Northern had a store wide sale, priced right, took a little adjusting to and after a month, the feed for the wire inside quit, so I returned it for a new unit. Works well, but a little touchy on the range for the feed rate. Seems to blow out the circuits in my garage (on a dedicated line) when running on high for any ""extended"" times, like longer than five minutes. It took a little bit of finagling to get it set-up, but does a decent job otherwise. I used both the flux core wire and eventually bought an airtank for ""no slag"" welds. I'm used to the Hobart 135 (now the 140 series) which I use a fair amount at work. It is a lot more forgiving, and I'm selling this and getting one of the new Hobarts. Last I checked, Northern didn't have these on their website, but may still be the stores. Good deal if you want an inexpensive, basic set-up. Welds thin gauge to 1/4"", but anything bigger, you'll need more power."
4,song book,"this is nice because it gives you examples of the chords. Great songs but only thing that would make it better is, needs to be bigger so you can keep the pages open. You really need to photo copy the pages so you can keep it on your stand and see it to play."
3,It depends on what you're expecting.,"I fell in love with Bhangra, so I ventured over to Bollywood for a similar flavor. Bollywood has a much different feel than does Bhangra. The beats and musical arrangement are more similar to Western culture than are Bhangra, so I was pleased with the presentation, but found that I am much more of a Bhangra fan. I enjoy travelling musically away from Western sounds. Bollywood lacks the hard dohl beat of Bhangra, but does hang on to the cultural echos of India. I do enjoy my Bollywood album, but I still favor my Bhangra favorites. If you haven't tried Bhangra and you do enjoy Bollywood, try Bhangra's Punjab collection. You won't be disappointed."
4,Lovely songs,"I am a fan of Indian music, and this cd offered fun singalong songs. They are very catchy and pretty. My personal favorites are songs 1, 2, 8, and 12. This music is not the same, to me, as the music of Ravi Shankar and other more traditional Indian artists. These songs have more of a western structure, with the 4/4 beats and the verse/chorus pattern. I recommend this cd to anybody looking for the 'typical', romanticized Indian sound that they might have heard here in the West."
3,Very nice,"I am glad I got this, there are some great songs, and I've actually seen some of the movies, so can put the song within the story. That being said, an album without Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh or Ashe Bhosle isn't quite the ""best."" The recordings, though, are well done, and this is a pleasant addition to my collection."
2,A little bit of a con...,"Good collection, yes - but a little unfair - as all the tracks are lifted from another collection, ""The Music of Bollywood"", which is a THREE disc collection, and provides a wider repetoire, thus giving a better insight into the huge range of Bollywood-type music."
2,Took me FOREVER to realize how to give them id info!,"If it weren't for reading these other reviews, I would have never understood how the company would get my info for the tags! I couldn't find this basic information ANYWHERE! Maybe I am blind, but I highly suggest that they make this information MUCH more clear! I have been panicked that I was jipped or something"
3,mainstream mistakes,"MOS is great but uses too many big mainstream tracks that barely capture the true feeling of electro house. although there are some great tracks here they cannot compare to compilations like ""the world's greatest electro house"" that has some real nice hard electro house."
2,SONG AT END OF MOVIE,Nina Simone's 'Sinnerman' remix by Felix Da Housecat which plays at the end of the moviedont buy the score soundtrack
1,No Music,"I bought the soundtrack CD it is not what I expected at all. I wanted the songs with singing in them from the movie, like Cinemon was a very good song at the end of the movie during the credits. This was a big dissapointment no songs, Just background Symphony. I'am discusted I wish I could get my money back from this CD $18.00 What a waste of money."
1,THANK YOU MELANIA FOR POINTING OUT THE SONG TITLE.,"I just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song. Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at the end. I realize this CD is just a soundtrack, but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs. It is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this CD.MY VOTE - DO NOT BUY THIS CD. The soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff. BUT GET THE ENDING TITLE SONG IF YOU CAN - It's great."
1,Not like the movie,There were some songs in the movie that were not on the soundtrack. Wanted this for those specific songs. Bought for nothing!
2,thanks melania,"I would have saved more time if I had read the reviews first, thanks for the help finding that one song I wanted! verve remix 2"
3,Whats the song?,Is that the same song at the end as it is when he is running up the stairs of the bank?
2,tcnewark,"This is a comfortable chair but a vibration chair (not a massage chair).If you want a massage chair , get a AG-3001 Anti-Gravity Lounger with Shiatsu Massage System ."
3,UNHAPPY,"GOOD AND DURABLE, GOOD ZERO GRAVITY POSITION, NOT GOOD MASSAGE CHAIR, ALL IT DOES IS VIBRATES. MASSAGE PORTION HORRIBLE."
2,Cheap but not durable,"Fairly comfortableSeat locks don't last long before the seat cannot hold position. Heat/ Massage a bit on the cheap side. Seats start to fall apart, especially in terms of support.Main reason for low rating is these chairs do not last long...if only they had a better locking mechanism and were more durable"
3,expected more,"i was excited to see what gems await me inside this book to help camaraderie in my office, but after reading some of these ideas, i decided to return the book.everyone is different but these were not ideas i was looking for. perhaps they may be good for you.for example:one idea in the book is to break up your group into 2 teams. give each team a deck of cards and see which team can pass the cards down the line quickest.another idea was to imagine you have a bunch of old washing machines (or something like that) and each team you has to figure out a way to sell them (which is supposed to see how the team can be creative and work together)maybe this is one book you 'look inside' before you actually buy. or maybe the ideas are actually good, and i didn't give them enough of a chance. sometimes i can be a hard grader."
3,A bit trite,"I found most of the exercises trite and would be embarassed to use them in front of a group. A couple were useful, though."
5,This is just what I've been looking for!!!,"In today's world of do more in less time it's important to find suggestions that are both helpful and insightful. Brian Miller has nailed it! I am committed to providing my associates with a monthly teambuilding session but have often come up short because I am unable to find interesting, relevent and, dare I say, FUN, exercises. This book will make quite a difference in my upcoming meetings. I highly recommend it for all levels of associates. Thanks, Mr. Miller!"
5,It's A Great Help for Office Meetings!,"I am an Office Manager for a large busy Real Estate Office of 100 Agents and they are all independant Contractors basically and must rely primarily on self motivating activities to assure a sucessful business however it is my job to assist them in every way possible. Our Office meetings are extrememly important in that aspect, I have to try and top myself each week with some NEW Fresh motivational activities which I find in that little book!! It makes my life so much easier and the Agents Love the short but EFECTIVE activities. It's worth whatever I spent for it."
4,Delivered the goods,"I used this book when performing the role of a corporate trainer. Great to get some new ideas into the position to inject some ""originality"" into the position. Simple stuff. Easy to follow."
3,"Ideas are good, but Not a raving fan","It gives you great ideas for ice breakers, however most of the time I find myself tweaking the exercises as I find some of them lacking in creativity and excitement.Over all this book is a good last minute reference should you find yourself in a bind for ideas."
4,Great Resource!,"This book of team building activities is a great resource. I use it in my professional development workshops for Administrative Professional Services & Solutions. The ice breakers really get people moving around the room, finding out interesting information about each other, and talking. My husband started using it in teen camps he conducts to help the teenagers get to know each better. Teens are awkward when they first meet, and he says the activities bring them out and open them up. I recommend it to anyone who needs to bring groups together."
3,Quick Teambuilding Activities,"Lots of quick, easy to adapt, team building activities to use at your next meeting. I have already used several with minor adaptations and much success! Gets the team energized and ready to move!"
4,Quick Team-Building Activities,"Miller details 50 engaging exercises that can enhance teambuilding, communication, and creativity in any workplace. If a manager customizes the exercises to different personality types (Caretakers need different exercises than Controllers), the book can be very valuable.- Kaley Klemp & Jim Warner, Authors, ""The Drama-Free Office: A Guide to Healthy Collaboration with Your Team, Coworkers, and Boss"""
3,It was ok,"The book wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but it did provide a number of ideas for some quick teambuilding activities. After reading them all, I fund a small handful that I might use in the future. If those work out well, maybe I will try a few more. There was nothing groundbreaking in the book - more than anything else, it got my creative juices flowing & inspired me to think up ideas of my own."
3,Great Reference,"As stated with the emotional intelligence activities book, this is good, but sites like businessballs.com have greater selection of activities. Still this is a great reference to have for moment's notice. Activities are well explained."
1,Dead End Trails Leading Nowhere,"This work is poorly documented by tertiary books and articles and is inaccurate on many facts. Sources are clumped together as a Bibliography at the end with no reference to statements from those sources. In short, it is a loosely compiled piece with hardly any meaning."
4,Very informative,"I must admit that I haven't used the steps or principles in this book so don't ask for results from me. But I have read it. I bought it to help push product via the telephone but haven't found the time to sit and make all those ""cold calls"" yet. The book itself is full of great script ideas, off the cuff speaking techniques, organizational principles, handling rejection techniques, etc.. I like to read so I can tell that this book has a lot to offer those who deal with sales and more specifically phone sales... hence why I bought it. For those that need new ideas when it comes to phone sales/networking... check this book out."
4,Very enlightening,"Crystal Morrison has spent a great deal of time researching her work, based on the listing of references. While I hope to follow up some of her references with my own readings, it will take years to do much of the exhaustive reading in her field. Suffice it to say that there are no clear cut villans to point the finger at. Gread seemed to motivate everyone in this New World Adventure. Isabel is shown to be a very small-minded and certainly ruthless person. Ferdinand had(if the research is true) alienated himself from his Jewish ancestry, not to mention Santangel,someone clearly omitted from any history book I have ever read(for the same reason that this review will probably not get published). My only disappointment was the ending. History will have to correct itself."
1,Lawdy...Lawdy..Lawdy,"This album is so wack mang I love south shizznit but not dis dude fa real. over @ my homies, i heard a few bars and was like aiiight ill check mr step dadday out..what this i hear? Wak...mo wakness...beats aight...but..wak backpak rappa Wait a minute..iz you...oh hellll naw naw! No u aint dissin on the PASTOR!

Booty wack playa yo cd got thrown out my truck on the damm freeway mang UH HUH! COME ON!"
1,wow....,"when i saw the video for step daddy, i couldnt tell if this guy was serious or this was a joke. what a terrible song and video. how did this guy get a record deal? maybe i should try to get one, it seems pretty easy these days."
3,Not as bad as people say it is,"Obviously in Southern Rap it's hard to get quite as crunk as my boy David Banner and Lil' Flip. However, despite comments that he is a joke rapper ..., Hitman Sammy Sam keeps it off tha hook enough to tell them prime boyz to back the ---- off for a minute. Watch out for him. ...Key Tracks: 2, 4, 5, 7"
1,horrible,"after seeing this guys video i cant believe he has a record album. he is a clown rapper, he has no skillz do not waste your money avoid this album"
2,questionable quality control,"King size sheets were odered and paid for, the package labeled them king size. The label on the sheets are clearly marked Queen."
4,no hands-on experience and passed with the book,"This book covers almost everything you will need at your exam. Read the book carefully 2 times minimum, write the commands, read extra material about BGP on CCO e-learning plus a test from Boson and you will be prepared for the exam.I have given 4 stars because some places in the book are very difficult to read and understand, and lack of info on BGP.Success!"
4,book I am waiting,"This is the book I am waiting for a long time, they said it is gonna be oct 12, but I waited until today.need to buy one for the CCNP and CCDP."
5,This is a vwery excellent book,"I passed the test with a 873 out of 1000, needed 690 to pass. very good book, excellent! This book along with hands-on, the ccprep.com and cert21.com/cisco web sites . Their practice test simulates the real thing. There is also some very good white papers on the documentation homepage of cisco's website.

1,Building Scalable Cisco Networks,Please note that this book is for a retired exam. The new exam replacing this one is Building Scalable Cisco Internetworks (BSCI) 640-901Don't waste your money!
3,Budget Kitchen,"Every slice of the knife leaves a cut on the surface of this board. If that bothers you, you should get something else that's made of harder stuff. If you need to get something so you can stop using the dinner plates and counter top as a cutting surface, or if you like soft cutting boards (I think they feel better against the edge of the knife) then this might be right for you. Basically, it's under ten dollars and it's probably better than the one they have hanging up above the shelves at your local super market."
3,"Attractive, but gets cut up","I agree with the previous reviewers' comments. This is a very good looking cutting board. It's good enough looking to keep out on the counter. It is very easy and convenient to cut things on it. It is very dishwasher safe and easy to clearn. The only downside is that every knife cut does indeed leave a cut mark on the board. That probably won't cause me to toss it, but that one aspect was a bit disappointing."
4,Still Around Years Later!!!,"I purchased this cutting board YEARS ago and it is still doing its job. I pull it out no less than three times a week for varius chopping, slicing, dicing jobs needed in the kitchen. The workspace is more than adequate for any job I need and the handle is a handy little 'plus'. Granted cutting boards are far from glamourous but this one is a gem in my eye!"
1,Disappointed in BOARD!!,"This board is constructed of VERY soft material. All of the reasons that I ordered this were lost the first time that I used it.All of the knife marks are places where germs can accumulate. (Yes, I wash it, but sometimes my husband does.) My main reason for buying this board was because it was listed as ""nonporous"", if that is the reason you are looking at this board, forget it. ..."
5,So much better than wood,"This is definately a good cutting board. I owned a nasty old wood one for years, this plastic one is so much more durable and easy to clean."
5,"es exelente, se los recomiendo, canta muy bien",Paco barron es un exelente artista y eso lo vi reflejado en este disco
3,I got the wrong kind of snow :(,"As another reviewer mentioned that there is another type of snow that is much better - insta-snow.Though I was disappointed with this snow, but my daughter still loved it. I put it in a large container and she had fun playing with it.I have no idea how this could be reusable, but I guess for a while it can be re-moistened a bit.I went ahead and bought the insta-snow and boy the difference was huge."
2,Strictly for fans only,"This collection of one hit wonders, curios and bits and pieces is strictly for fans of Split Enz. Personally, I'm a huge fan and have followed the Enz since I was 7 (20 years ago) but even I have to admit that a fair amount of this stuff is unlistenable or below par. It is certainly not a CD that I'd want to hear often. Still, there is some worthwhile material, e.g. Tim Finn's solo stuff, the Crowded House tracks. CD2 is definitely better than the first."
2,Kiddie Da Gama,"I was excited to read the book but I must admit that when it arrived I realized it was like a school book. I was not that impressed with this book and even buying it used was expensive. I also purchased Henry the navigator ""A life"". It was more extensive of a book and less expensive. Go figure. I would like my money back for this book but it is impossible."
5,Wonderfull Product!,Love the scents and the all natural ingredients. No harmfull toxins here! The hair products leave my babies naturally curly hair super soft & shiny!
5,Awesome Product,I love these products. The fragrance is natural and not overwhelming as well as it does not irritate my daughter's skin or eyes.
4,Nice selection,The sizes are small but that's why it's called a starter tote in the first place. LOL. Good products but pricey.
3,Intriguing...,"I found this story to have an absolutely intriguing plot. The review before me has already explained the plot. So I guess I will just say that it's an amazing read especially after realizing the youth of its authoress.This book is wonderful for the family as a whole, and old and young together will find great delight in it. Read it and enjoy!!"
3,Fast-Paced Adventure Story,"The Poison Plot is a fast-paced adventure story centering around Roderic Di Venice and the nobles in the country of Calendenia. When his parents disappear, Roderic is eager to find the cause. Working under cover, he discovers that the evil Ravona has kidnapped them...in order to conceal a dark secret. But Roderic must deal with unexpected treachery along the way and define his own values, beliefs and emotions."
2,Average Joe Attempts to Teach Wine Making 101,"I bought this DVD to support a local resident of Ohio after reading an article about it in the newspaper. It seemed like a fun twist to learn more about wine. Although I did learn some things about wine making, corking, barreling, etc., I would have learned more if Eric the host was a better interviewer. He should have let the guests talk more and not interrupt them in the middle of their sentences, especially as they are trying to explain a technique. I also think the editing needed some work. The sound was muffled at times in addition to receiving too much background noise. I also spotted the camera and cables from time to time too. If wine intimidates you, this may be a good starter but don't expect to be wowed or blown away by this documentary. It was an average video put on by an average guy. That's what you should expect when you purchase this video."
5,Space/ambient dreams.,"I love Serrie's work - have been a fan since highschool. There is simply no better space/ambient music out there. I've used his cds in my yoga and pilates classes as well as a mental nightcap. If you have trouble sleeping, mediating, and/or winding down at the end of the day, Serrie may be your answer.His work is surreal without being airy-fairy new-agey. It's dark and definitely more ambient. All the men I've introduced to Serrie's music love it."
4,Pleasant Background Synth,"My favorite CD of all time in the soundtrack for the movie Bladerunner. I've long searched for ""the genre of music"" that this soundtrack represents.John Serrie appears to be one of the few artists interested in the genre, which appears to be called ""space music."" This music is atmospheric, beautiful, but does not demand your attention. This is perfect for my music needs -- something to listen to and enjoy while I'm programming, animating, or writing.I would normally recommend something that I enjoy as much as I enjoy this (and the other volume), but I know a lot of people who appear to despise music of this sort... You can't sing to it and you can't dance to it. In fact, you will probably never learn the names of individual tracks. Listen to the samples here on Amazon.com before you buy it."
5,Must Read For Dune Fans!!!!!,"This book was truly wonderful. I am a true Dune fanatic, and buy anything Dune. Please keep the books coming Mr. Herbert-your truly talented, and a wonderful person to carry out your father's legacy."
2,"Ghastly writing, some interesting content","After about 60 pages into this book, I was wondering - where were the editors at Tor when this was being made ready for publication? It is incredibly repetitious, there must be at least 4 different places where Brian Herbert writes that the seed idea for the Bene Gesserit was from Frank Herberts group of strong minded Roman Catholic aunts. Or, that a haiku is a 17 syllable Japanese poem. I could go on, but I think I've made the point.As others have mentioned, it is more of a family biography than a biography of Frank Herbert himself. There is far more about Brian Herbert in this work than I expected (or wanted).I think a good editor could have reduced this mess from a bloated 576 pages to a nice tight 300 pages.It was only my curiosity about Frank Herbert and the love I had for the first few Dune novels during my youth that enabled me to persist, via skimming.I certainly hope this will not be the ""definitive biography"" of Frank Herbert."
3,Generally interesting but implausibly voiced,"Though not lacking in sensationalism (several foiled molesters of young women), this ""novel"" like other recent Oe ""fiction"" bogs down in literary discussion (plus an endless discussion of a Russian film, ""The Stalker""). I find the voice and interests of the narrator (Oe's daughter) implausible. The device does allow self-flagellation for the as-ever guilt-ridden author, and another angle for celebrating (sentimentalizing) his handicapped but musically gifted son, Haraki."
1,Cheap plastic part,"Not only are the screws not part of the cap like the OEM part, but the plastic is very cheap. Mine broke when tightening the screws. I will return this cap and get an OEM replacement. I should have known not to buy a German part for a Japanese car."
3,"OK, but ...","I should have gotten the Honda cap. This fits OK, but the screws are not ""captured"" in the cap. With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out. Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage."
2,Made in Japan but not as good as OEM,"I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. When removing the existing one I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. The matching rotor was a PITA to remove, which I will explain in the rotor review. I won't buy this or the rotor again."
3,Test driven ski bag,"This bag isn't as padded as I'd hoped, there are no pockets or compartments, but my skis, poles, and boots all fit and survived two flights."
1,Forced Art,"Well, I don't make a habit of reviewing something negatively, but I had to write about this particular piece of work. This whole collection of music (really one song repeated throughout with lyrics that seem to worsen as chapters unfold) is some of the most forced and uninspired music that I've ever heard. It sounds like it was all written in one evening. Even if it is supposed to be funny (like some other reviews say), it's not very clever. R Kelly used to have a shred of admiration from me, but not anymore. What's up with that echo at the end of every chapter? Really, it just makes me laugh. We're all just a little dumber by listening to it. Personally, I want my five minutes back. They would have been better spent raking leaves...leaves...leaves...leaves...leaves...leaves."
3,Should've Stayed in The Closet!,"What makes this so stupid is that 1) Same melody throughout all the chapters 2) Because of that same melody, it gets really irritating 3)It's marketed as a serious ""project"" when it should've been on Comedy Central. Dave Chappelle please make a parody of this soon....!Granted the melody is nice, the first 5 minutes of it, but soon after, like i said, I got tired.So dont buy this. Simply download it. It's worth it in the end when you also get tired of it after the first few times of watching it."
4,Unintentionally Brilliant,"The true brilliance of this DVD comes from its unintentional hilarity when watched with R. Kelly's commentary feature turned on. While the PC side in me cries when I watch the most heinous stereotypes reinforced by the artist, it is easily subdued and beat up by my ironic side which was gasping for air after laughing so hard at the genius stupidity of R. Kelly's insight. To be watched with many friends."
3,He's a whole bucket of crazy,"I must've made everyone I know watch the first 5 chapters of this monstrosity, cause, frankly, it was the most entertaining thing that came out this summer. Everyone had the same reaction: confusion, followed by disbelief, followed by laughter, ending with transcendence. R. Kelly is the craziest man in R & B and always has been. He is also the only person whole could pull this off with a straight face. The first five chapters were quasi-brilliant in there repetative structure and overly complex storytelling. The next few become hilarious because no one is supposed to take it seriously. It hardly even makes sense, but that is also hardly the point.Buy it for your grandparents, or grandchildren. Everyone can learn from this."
3,A happening...?,"if Robert Kelly is serious, then this is a sad, sad affair. But if Trapped in the Closet was recorded with tounge firmly in cheek, then R. Kelly may very well be the Andy Kaufman of R/B."
5,The Funniest DVD Of The Year,"If you're reading this, you already know what it's all about. So I will just say this: This is quite possibly the most entertainingly ridiculous thing I've ever seen since ""Showgirls"".So bad, it's brilliant. If you don't laugh out loud watching this, you need to hike up your pants and get a sense of humor.It's genius. Sheer, unadulterated genius."
4,R. Kelly,"Brought this for a friend. I like R. Kelly, but to me this work is not my favorite. However, it was not for me it was for my friend and she loves it."
5,This changed my life yo!,"Finally, my generation has its own life-altering concept album/film. Not since Pink Floyd's The Wall have I been on such a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Plus, this music is way better than Pink Floyd and will still be spinning in people's DVD players long after everyone has forgotten about The Wall. Please buy as many copies of this as you can afford. If we don't show our support of this awesome work, the sequel (entitled ""Baby...I Swear I Don't Knows Dat Midget) may never see the light of day. Bless you R. Kelly and bless all the sweet young girls you peed on for inspiration."
5,"In all seriousness, no, in the use of substance, yes.","Simply put, this is the stupidest thing ever, but you will have a blast watching it when you are as high as a kite. It is so surreal in its predictive plot and predictive twist that you will not believe this is something real.Especially the ""CHARACTER"" commentary for certain chapters. What the F*CK? Wow.Put this and Life with Bobby Brown on your XMAS list. This is just something you have to watch and be in awe that it actually exist, even if it is this stupid."
5,"um, are people missing the point?","this is SUPPOSED to be funny! i am by no means an R. Kelly fan (not musically or for his behavior) but i can't help but love this series. some chapters aren't as funny as others but it's basically an overdramatized, funny and yes, smart, soap opera. if you are looking for a serious piece of drama, well, this ain't it. if you watch this knowing it's a comedy and enjoy that kind of thing, you'll love it. check it out on IFC for free!"
1,Hilarious exposé of a fool,"One of the funniest things I've ever seen. It's very hard to believe that such self-parody is not the product of a comic genius. The best thing for R Kelly to do would be to pretend he was just kidding, that this was all a pastiche. He'd be hailed as the new Woody Allen.Instead, it seems, Kelly believes this atrocious, childish hodgepodge of stereotypes and soapy cliches is his masterpiece.How anyone can not laugh at the cherry pie, the whole midget/Bridget episode, the casual whipping out of guns at the slightest provocation, the intoned soulfulness of the most inane and banal lyrics, is beyond me.I urge everyone to watch this. You'll never forget it. Your shoes won't fit because your toes will curl so much."
5,Truly wonderful,"Nothing can prepare you for the emotions you will feel as you watch R Kellys masterpiece. He has crafted a story so clever and intricate that you cannot possibly guess what will happen next. Combine this with his slick direction, inventive cinematography and you have a film that captures the zeitgeist and shows us all what is is to be human. Bravo. Oh and its full of swears!"
1,Stoopid!,This is the dumbest thing Ive ever seen!!! I cant believe someone took R. Kelly serious enough to produce this....
1,What a Joke...,"I can not believe I waisted my time watching this peace of c$%p! It was like a car crash, you don't want to look, but curiosity gets the better of you. Another reviewer was right, if this was put on Comedy Central, I might have given it 2-3 stars, but RKelly was serious with this. I wish I could give it 0 stars. Just thinking about how garbage like this makes it on the air makes me sick. I like RKelly, but he went overboard with his Looney side on this one."
1,Should've shot himself with his own Baretta,"Poop poop poop. Pee pee pee. I wanna piss on you ~ Kelly R. courtesy of Dave ChappelleThis video sux. The Pied Piper is losing it. I'll admit I was into it until the midget, cherry pie and all that bulls---. Plop plop drip. Sh-tty sound effects. Oh God.Kels needs some mental help. I believe he is over the edge. Listen to some of his new songs..Sex Weed..Sex in the kitchen....Arrrrgghhhhhhhh!I'd rather watch Being Bobby Brown and Flavor of Love"
2,Was he serious?,"The only thing that kept me from giving this 1 star was the comedic value. Too bad it was unintentional. If this had been an intentional comedy, I might be able to appreciate it. But the fact that he was serious makes it that much worse. And was it necessary to depict all blacks as deceitful cheaters? Seriously !! And the commentary was even more comical than the video itself. I've officially lost all respect for this man."
1,Trapped in the closet,"Is a hidden message from a man struggling with his own sexuality,begging for someone to help himcome out...of the closet.Top-notch Oscar worthy performances by R-Kellyand all the other wonderful ""actors""The academy better take notice.click yes if you agreeps:sarcasm,for those who didn't get it."
1,AIN'T SO SUCH THING AS AN UNRATED VERSION!!!!!!!,"First of all if its unrated please stop faking a ""bleep"" sound everytime they cursed with the f word or any other of that matter. It should be underrated just for that. Have both the clean and explicit versions. ain't nothin different."
1,"This DVD should have stayed in a ""closet""","I won't go on about R. Kelly and how he raped that 14 year old girl, but I will say that this DVD made me puke. It's a DVD that stereotypes black people as sexually irresponsible animals. Thanks, Kels, for reinforcing a racist stereotype! We'll see you in court when the trial begins!"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!,"I was very disappointed. I couldn't wait to see what would be in the last chapters, but after I had watched them, I wshed I had not. Come on....a midget? WHY? The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because he was smart enough to grab everyone's attention in the beginning which turned out to be a great marketing strategy. However, the ending left MUCH to be desired. The man is talented, but he certainly didn't show it with this production."
2,this story is getting really ridiculous......,"r. kelly maybe songwriter of our generation but this is a load of crap..... I was a fan of the first 5 chapters when it first premiered and i was shocked. now he came with the other 7 and it is not the same, the story is just turning to another episode of NICK CANNONS WILD N' OUT....this story is just getting random and is not adding up...i think that it should have stopped at CHAPTER 7 just because it would end on a better note...at the end of the day, it is just too much drama with a over pour of silliness and R.Kelly should stop before it goes too far...2 out of 5 stars just because i liked the first 5 chapters"
1,Chicago is windy because this thing sucks so badly,"OK, I rented the DVD because of all the hype. And now after watching it, I have no idea what point R. Kelly was trying to make. This man has written some fantastic melodies with meaningful lyrics, but this is not one of them. Thank God, I only wasted the price of a rental on this drivel. It's a complete waste of talent, film and my time. You've been warned."
4,nice but overpriced,"Very well made gloves hold up well for just about anything.The knuckle guards are a big help in tight spaces and can kinda double as a fingernail.klein always makes good hand tools at about double the price they are worth,nice if you've got the money but if your hands aren't constantly bleeding you don't need these."
1,not a great pair of gloves,I was expecting a heavy-duty pair of gloves these ones are thin and after woring in the for a few weeks they all ready have holes in them I work hard and I need my gloves to be able to take a beating these one don't make the cut I'm verry disapointed
4,fine gloves but expensive,These are nice comfortable gloves and reasonably protective. They also allow for pretty good fine dexterity (holding onto screws and such) compared to other protective gloves. But for the price there are better options out there.
1,changed recipe?,When we first tried this version it was not too hot at all and we loved the flavor of the sauce. We always added shrimp and boneless chicken thighs. I've recently bought what I guess is a new recipe and had to throw it out. Way too hot! We're so disappointed. Wish I knew for sure how this one is.
3,Not like authentic Thai,"Ok, but certainly need to add some fresh items to make this good. Try with chicken OR shrimp, egg, peanuts, and fresh cilantro."
3,It was ok.,"This noodle dish is a bit spicy and the noodles never seem to cook evenly, but the flavor is decent and its a really easy dish to make and is great if you add some chicken to it."
1,disgusting!,"This was foul, although oddly it had a bland, if unpleasant, flavor while also an extremely strong and unpleasant odor. We threw it in the garbage."
1,HOT !!!,"When I ordered this product, it came in the HOT version. Although the photo of the product did not indicate HOT.Hot Thai food is very hot. I like hot peppers, this is was way over the top. Only used about 1/4 of the sauce, and supplemented with other seasonings."
4,Good anti-itch cream,"Of most of Gold Bond's anti-itch products, I found that the cream works the best. The cream will remedy the itch for a good 8 hours... then another application is needed. The cream can be applied to vertical surfaces, as the neck and remain on the skin without the loss of the product by falling off..ie...itch powder. Will order again when needed. :-}"
5,Outstanding supplement to any multivariable calculus course,"I am a returning student, getting my certification to become a math teacher after several years in the corporate world, and I'm reviewing all the math I learned (or, rather, thought I'd learned) in undergrad. Full disclosure, I took calculus through DiffEQ back in college. But I haven't touched any math more challenging than my tax returns in over ten years, so I'm rusty. This DVD series brought it all back, and then some. I find myself understanding the calculus WAY better now than I did the first time through, and I attribute that understanding, in large part, to watching these DVDs. For each section, I typically watch the introduction, then when I get to the example problems, I pause the video and try to work the example myself before watching Jason's explanation. I find this really helps me ""get"" the underlying logic of the problem (and work on my weaknesses). Five stars, two thumbs way up, excellent product!"
3,good walk thrus,Easy to follow format and continuity from one topic to another. Good for review after a long lapse in learning calculus.
5,History of words,This is the complete dictionary by Pierre Chantraine of the etymology of the Greek language. There is a subtitle: History of the words. And this subtitle is true: each article in the book can be read like a history and even like a story of each word. It is fascinating.
3,Very readable biography of a free spirit in old San Francisc,"A well researched history of Alma Spreckles, of the Spreckles sugar fortune. The life of Alma, a determined woman, active arts patron, and socalite, is told in a fast moving story. I bought this for my mother, who enjoyed it and sent it back for me to read too."
5,Very Well Written and Interesting,"Excellent book about life as it was lived before 1900. Well written couldn't put it down. And, ended up giving it to my grand kids they loved it, from what I understand it is being still lent out to others. Fantastic read, very happy it came back in print again. Books like this are a rare treat."
4,Tomboy Bride -- The hard life of a miner's wife,"I bought this book on recommendation from tour guides in Telluride, Colorado. I had taken a jeep ride up to the mining area that forms the subject of much of this book. After having finished the book, I can second the recommendation.The author is not a professional writer, and it shows. But you can still tell she is speaking the truth of her experience. The hardships that she, her husband and here little daughter endured will surprise modern, well educated readers. I say well educated, because both she and her husband received the kind of education that modern readers would expect to lead to cushy executive jobs. Not so here. They seem to have been living just at the poverty level for many years as her husband labored in the mines. Through her eyes you will have some sense of life in one of the most important mining areas at that time.To those who have visited this area, reading the book will provide a welcome recollection of its beauty."
4,A Diary That Reads Like a Novel,"Harriet Backus chronicles her everyday life with a riveting narrative of her experiences in the early 20th century mining camps of the west. One cannot help but marvel at how our ancestors dealt with the harshness of life without the creature comforts we now all enjoy. But of course they knew no other way, so therefore accepted the hardships as they lived their lives. The author's marvelous way with words enables her history to come alive, making the reader feel like a companion sharing her joys, griefs and wonders of the world she encountered."
5,A great read!,"Tom Boy Bride was fun to read. I have always wondered about the folks doing all the gold and silver mining in the Colorado mountains and what their lives must have been like. It was absolutely amazing what those living in and around the mining areas had to go through and what their living conditions were like. The extreme weather conditions and how to get to some of the places where the mines and towns were located was well described. The heroine of the book, Harriet Backus, was quite a woman without fear obviously and one who was very adventurous. Tom Boy Bride is well written and gives a good insight into the lives of people in the west at the end of the 19th century. I have fourwheeled in the Tom Boy mine area and the way Harriet describes the scenery is spot on. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about a woman's life during the gold and silver mining days of the west."
5,Tomboy Bride Review,"This book was an awesome account of life in the mining camps of Colorado, full of history and reality, but was presented in fictional-type reading. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Colorado history, especially women, dealing with the hardships as well as the beauty of our Colorado mountains."
4,"A good, informative book","It was and informative interesting in parts but too much timen was taken up with the different leagues ,districts etc. It was well written"
4,Hope it Works!,Great books with lots of ideas. Hope I can remember to do at least two things at the same time.
5,Excellent book!,"If you play doubles, league or otherwise, you need this book. I want all my teammates to read and use it, and all my opponents to ignore this review! Buy the book. 'Nough said."
4,Technical but very informative,"This book is packed with great strategies and tips for the doubles player who wants to improve his/her game and take it to the next level. It has some diagrams (not enough, in my opinion). It can also serve as a good tool for coaches to remind students of the mindset needed for elevating their doubles game. It can get somewhat technical at times, but a player can learn a lot from this book."
3,For experienced players,"Good presentation of the author's view of modern doubles. To understand her strategies you need a good understanding of tennis strokes and the game of doubles. I'm an experienced senior player and would find some of the ideas presented hard to implement. That does not mean that you shouldn't try.The game of tennis and doubles is constantly evolving. Though I don't agree with everything she proposes, it is a good book for ideas on how to play the modern game of doubles."
5,Best Doubles Tennis book EVER!,"I bought this tennis book for my wife who plays doubles tennis 5 days a week.She told me it's the ""Best doubles tennis book she ever read""."
4,Informative,**** Informative doubles strategy - per the title. The only confusion is when the text sometimes refers to illustrations that are on a different page. Glad I bought it.
3,Not practical,"This book was written in a very complicated language.I bought the Skip Singleton's ""Inteligent Doubles"" and found it far uncomplicated and better to understand and to put in practice ."
5,This is the best book on doubles strategy yet.,"Having played and coached at the college level, Blaskower pretty much summed up in a couple of hours what took me years to learn the hard way. I hope my competitors don't read this book. This is a great book for intermediate and up."
3,More suited for experienced doubles player trying to improve,"Did not read book in it entirety. In first several chapters found the author repeatedly refering to terms and topics and not properly defined in previous paragraphs or chapters. I believe the book well suited to experienced doubles players who already understand this facet of the game and are trying to improve, but not well suited to players such as myself, who are just beginning to play doubles and need understanding from the ground level up."
5,We're winning matches using Pat's strategies!,"When we began playing tennis 4 years ago, we purchased the first edition of The Art of Doubles. Pat showed us strategies that no one else was teaching and we referred to her book many times since 2005. Now that we are reading Pat's second edition, with her new strategies that are evolving like the game of tennis is, we are winning matches. Even when we are playing with other partners who aren't using our new strategies, we are scoring more points than we used to. I will read this book cover to cover many times over like I did the first edition. I highly recommend this book to anyone who plays tennis or who is considering playing someday."
2,Boring,"Another entry into the chick lit genre.Emily finds out her boyfriend has betrayed her by putting up pictures of her on the Net.Enter the best friend, Cara who is going to do all she can to make sure that Emily snaps out of it.The beginning of this book is so boring that I already started regretting having bought it by page 2.The two main female leads are portrayed as just so different and in fact, this is a huge problem with the story. The two worlds just don't jive.While the author has a down to earth feeling about her writing, I thought this story was boring, standard, overly done chick lit.This should definitely be a pass."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,This is one story that will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering when these two will wake up and smell the coffee! I've never cried so much! It is a very touching story. A must read that you do not want to put down! I truly enjoyed it. You go girl!Patricia Hartfield
2,Not a full wiring kit!! Very angry!,The 17 foot antenna cable that is supposed to be with the kit was in fact not with the kit. For warning to any potential buyers there is another kit you must buy to complete after market radio install. Very upset that description lacks detail..
1,Bad,"Peter O'Toole is my favorite actor, and he's striking and charismatic and gives a fine performance here: But the reality is great actors--no matter how the media hypes them--can not transcend crap scripts and crap directors. Of course when they act in great scripts, we think the actors made up their lines as they went, which is why top actors make $25 million a movie, whereas top screenwriters make $2 million a movie. I fast forwarded through most of this junk. The only solid very short scene that is worthy is the press conference at the beginning. O'Toole IS the most charismatic actor since Cary Grant. But the rest of the movie is terrible."
1,WATCH IT!,"This was an excellent movie that i saw entirly by accident. i was watching Television one night and it came on. I was too lazy to change the channel, and am eternally gratefull. It is not that the movie was all the special but there was something about it that hooked me and kept me watching. It has a very haunting sound track and some fairly funny parts. over all it is a good movie to watch if you are bored some night. Maybe not to buy but definatly a renter!"
3,A comedy about death that works.,"Peter O'toole & Colin Firth work wonderfully together as a famous movie star and his murderer who go to a hotel that COULD be the afterlife OR a ""waiting room"" to above or below. When Firth gets a 2nd chance at life, he reluctantly takes O'toole with him. The ending is surprisingly touching. Each character learns something about himself, and each seems to get exactly what he deserves. Excellent acting -- especially by Colin Firth."
3,Better than I thought from the reviews below,"Yeah, the writing and directing gets a little confused. Yeah, Peter O'Toole plays himself really well. But if you're a Colin Firth fan, this movie is a must. Lots of CF screen time--and he does an excellent job with a minimally workable script. Despite the fact that he's a murderer, you still like his character.Overall, I liked the quirky premise, too, despite the confusion."
3,"Great info, hard reading","The information in this book is excellent but it is very difficult to follow on account of it's age/scientific language. But it doesn't make the information any less valid. If you are new to the concept that the germ-theory is flawed, I would recommend an easier reading book first (maybe a couple). ""Food is your best medicine"" would be a good one to start with. But if you are up to it, this book has great info on Pasteur and Bechamp. The author does seem a little biased (or alot), but I don't blame them. :)"
1,More frustration than inspiration,"Buyer beware: this book might in fact be essential, but only if you can read music with fluency and work well with tab. Otherwise, it is light on useful information and extremely frustrating. Lessons are too fast, without proper and reasonable building block instruction. Only for advanced guitarists well versed in theory. Rating. 1/5"
3,A split decision,"I was so excited to view part one of this video. Covering the period up to 1965, it took a close look of the song structures and playing styles that made the Beatles unique and revolutionary. I was in heaven.Then I played the second part, and all the musical commentary was gone. It was far too much significant material to cover in one hour, and every masterpiece album was glossed over. They spent more time on ""Magical Mystery Tour"" than ""Revolver"", the White Album or ""Abbey Road"".The second part is useless to anyone who's a big Beatles fan and knows the history."
1,Not the same,"This product is advertised as containing Retinol A. The product I received does not contain Retinol A and is in a different box then pictured here. The seller does not accept returns on cosmetics, although they did say they would accept my return since it was not as pictured, but having to pay for the S&H both ways and a 15% restocking fee, it isn't worth returning. I won't be ordering from them again."
5,The Best Thing Since Sliced bread,3 WORDSOFFDACHAIN!!!I bought this Cd for my son and we both enjoy it. A kid who is a lyricst and does it without cursing...HOUSTONWE HAVE A PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Deal,Received item when promised. Modem is easy to set up and works great. I would do business this person again.
2,Very hard to configure,I am driving myself crazy trying to configure it. None of the information of my ISP fits into this router.
2,Modem needs to sit for 24hrs after setup,"For some reason - and this isn't the first router or modem I've set up, this thing was just SUPER buggy. It would sporadically work until it sat for a 24hrs. No idea why this is. It did this when it was first set up and again when I moved it. Needless to say, I've taped the cords to their sockets with notes that says do not remove. I would have paid double for my girlfriend and I to have not been pulling our hair out while installing and trying to figure this out. But, it does work. Hopefully it continues to."
3,Good Enough for Now,"I bought this modem to replace my Speedstream 5100. I use a router in my house because there are multiple people that have laptops. However, this modem doesn't work well with the router. So if someone needs to use the internet they have to connect their laptop directly to the modem. This problem may not arise with all people. But if you use a router, then beware before purchasing the Netopia. When connected directly to the laptop, the internet works fine. So it's good enough until I update my internet service."
4,Not to difficult to set up,Product works well with my Sonic.net DSL service. Product menus are not the easiest to navigate (thus the 4 stars) otherwise set up was very simple. I did have to put the modem in bridge mode to work with my wireless router (something I did not have to do with my old ATT provided speedstream). Product also worked with my ATT DSL service. Set up took about 10 minutes.
1,Didn't work for me,"I needed a new dsl modem and based on reviews this one seemed to be the best in terms of performance and price. Ordered it, it arrived, installation was difficult, finally got it to work, and then it stopped just as fast. Gave it more than a few chances, but would not hold an internet connection. Returning it and going to try another modem. This one did not work for me."
5,Works Great! Does Everything It Said It Would Do!,Received the modem in just a couple of days from when I ordered it and it has worked perfectly since I got it - definitely worth it!
2,Modem overheats.,This modem was a direct replacement for another that kept over heating. The only reason I stuck with the same modem was that was the only one that was compatible with my ISP. And then after year it overheated.
1,overheats,If you buy this modem be prepared to install a fan on it. The modem will overheat and kill itself within a year.
1,Real cost over $10.00,"These people are charging an additional $4.00+ dollars for a ""E-Mail"" pin number and calling it a shipping charge. The terrible thing about this is that you have to go all the way to check out to find this out, have to fill out all the information, credit cards and shipping address. Hey Amazon, this is a rip off. The real cost of this card is over $10.00 because they pocket the ""shipping charge."""
4,Perfect for emergency or infrequent use,"I've been looking around for a long-distance calling card for some time that:1) Had no expiration date, and didn't require me to make calls with it every X months.2) That I could use from a pay phone.3) That had a relatively good price.I don't have a cell phone, and don't travel much; but I want to have something I can use in an emergency from a pay phone, or from a hotel phone.I'm amazed that the big companies (AT&T;, Sprint, etc.) don't offer something to fit the bill, but they don't; I'm willing to pay more to get something that meets my specification.I've used PinByEmail for several months, and it's worked very well -- no complaints. And the price, at $10, is perfect for what I want.However, I agree that the shipping charges are disingenuous; it would be better to put the price at $9.99 with no shipping charges. I would have been more disgruntled about this if I hadn't known about this going in (thanks to the previous reviewers.)"
3,A bit skimpy,"Maybe it's because I haven't bought childrens books in awhile, but this is a very small, very short book. I guess I expected more?? Either way, the kids love it, so that was the point."
3,First one dead. Next one fine,First item dead (refurbished). Return and exchange without incident. Second one works well.
1,Horrible product from Black & Decker,The motor burned on my first usage. It is an horrible product. I will not recomend this product.
2,Worked for 3 minutes,"Black & Decker 13-Inch Automatic Feed String Trimmer and Edger #ST7700Easy to assemble, light weight, great manuverability.....died after just 3 (approx) minutes. I gave it a few 10 minute intervals to 'rest' after that long workout, finally sticking it back in the box and returning. Got prompt replacement, it's in my garage...unopened. Sure hope I can get a season out of it next year...high hopes. Wonder how good the edger works? Could've used that this past season.I don't recommend this particular trimmer; spend a few more bucks and hopefully you'll get your job done."
2,Could be better???,"This trimmer is pretty decent for the price but it goes through the line faster than I could ever imagine. In the past month, I went through 4 rolls of line- 1/week. Automatic feed is too sensitive and line is too thin for the trimmer; it should be redeveloped to allow usage of thicker line and less sensitivity.In all, I'm not too impressed and since the mowing season is almost over, I will wait to buy a different trimmer in the spring. In other words, don't buy it unless you want to spend the purchase price over and over again in replacement line spools :-("
4,Very Good Product,"The delivery service and the price by Amazon was very good.This weedwacker replaced a previous Weedeater with more power that died out on me after two years.Although this BD product has less power, it is light in weight and does the job well.The construction is plastic but I am hoping that it will have durability for a couple of years at least.If this product lasts a few years I will then say 5 stars."
1,Auto feed? Try no feed!,What a worthless product. I wonder if the design engineers ever actually tested these things in a real environment. The auto feed never works. Ever try to trim with one to two inches of line? That's all that ever comes out. They say do not bump it on the ground like a regular feed trimmer but out of frustration you will. Guess what happens - The spool cracks and breaks. I have roughly one hundred feet of trimming to do. After two and a half times I gave up on the trimmer. I could cut it faster with a hand trimmer. I'm returning it tomorrow. It is one month old.
2,Great While it Lasted,"This weedeater was light and easy to use. It did a great job, but unfortunately it started smoking and burned up before we finished even one small job. It was being used in normal fashion, and we cannot account for what happened. The price was wonderful, but not for less than one full use."
1,Missing Parts,"I wish I could review the product fully, but Amazon shipped it without the black plastic shroud that goes on the back of the motor. And right now, I don't know when I'll get a replacement. It was at a good price and it looks nice - but not very useful in the shape it's in."
1,Real disappointment,When I ordered this trimmer I was under the impression that I could start using it right away. Not so! It did not come with an electrical cord so could get started.Had to go out and look for a cord that would fit! Great frustration.
1,Used it twice and it quit working,"First off, I would like to say that this thing definitely looks cheaply made. The extent to just how flimsy and cheap this trimmer looks shocked me when I first took it out of the box. I expected cheap, but this is on a whole different level, almost like it should be a kids toy-trimmer. The two times I was able to use it, I was relatively pleased with it. However, just as I finished edging around my deck, it died on me. I thought perhaps it was the outlet, so I reset it. Nope. Then, I thought perhaps it was the extension cord, but I plugged something else and that fired right up. I guess I will use the ""2 year warranty"" that supposedly comes with this, but I would much rather have my $50 back. This is my first B&D product and it will be my last."
5,Eats the weeds,"Getting tired of pulling on those gas models try this little bad boy, this is one tough weed eater. Price was great too."
1,Definitely not a grasshog,Horrible product. Almost caught fire from burned out motor on first useage. It started smoking after six minutes of light use. Do not buy. Buy one of the Black & Decker grasshog models instead. They need to recall this thing before someone gets injured.
2,Cheap,"The one I had not only didn't last very long, but while it did work, the power and the .062"" string was very underwhelming. If you don't want to use a gas-powered weed whacker, look for the Ryobi electric trimmer with the .080"" line."
5,very handy for small jobs,"Black & Decker is a reliable name whose products I have purchased over the years. I actually bought this particular product as a standby, but use it more than I thought I would. I have a very small lawn in the front and back and actually have someone mow the front lawn for me. However, my back lawn's grass is kind of weak and his equipment is too powerful, it always killed some of the grass, especially around the edges with the trimmer he uses. I decided to do it myself so I purchased this lightweight trimmer and it serves my purpose. My grass is in better shape than it was and I really don't mind doing such a small lawn this way. In early spring when the grass has started to grow, before this person starts his mowing season, my trimmer comes in handy to give a finished look to my front lawn. Again, I am using this on a very small lawn and it does a great job. Let's not forget it's intended purpose, it also does a great job trimming and edging."
4,a tight fast moving true war story,"i saw this as a kid and thought it was a very cool movie. this is one of three movies i found in a three for $10.00 bin. i was very happy to find this overlooked war movie again.the red ball express was the name given to the army supply drivers of world war II. after d-day patton's army was moving so fast that supplies fell behind, so the red ball express was put into action.the movie is very good and it shines a light on a very important and over looked piece of world war II history!!"
2,Red Ball Ezxpress,"The cassette worked well in the machine, but the actual movie was poor. The movie was historically inaccurate and the acting was amaturish.I'm glad I bought it, however. My father was in the Red Ball Express during WWII. I feel like I have a souvenir."
1,what I could see it was as great as I remember,"The memories of watching the movie with my Dad, it was everything I remember. However, the video stopped playing in the middle. So very dis-apointed. as I had planned to send it on to my Dad. What do I do can I get a replacement ?Laurie"
4,"Pretty good, but not perfect","I enjoyed this book in general but I was turned off by the main character's tendency to be rude to her neighbor when she turned down the tea that was offered and when her neighbor was hesitant to join the Mormon Church. The neighbor became her best friend. But in real life I'm not so sure that would have been the case.But the story was interesting and had fun twists and turns and the characters were well drawn and usually very likeable. So other then my pet peeve, I would recommend this book to Mormon friends."
5,Great for the first published,"I fully enjoyed every moment in the book. It made me laugh a lot at the humorous side..It made me hold on as i turned page after page to find out what was going to happen. I stayed up til late at night until i finally made myself go to sleep saying i'll enjoy it more in the morning, and not being able to sleep because i wanted to turn the light back on and read more...It was a great romance as well..It had my heart pounding through out the whole thing. That was my favorite part. It wasn't over done either. Just enough to make me happy. I loved it. Good job to Betsy. I hope to see more in the future!"
4,prompt service,I had already listened to this book from the library and wanted to own it. I was very pleased with the condition of the book and how promptly it came.
4,"Pretty good, with one problem","My son loves his new And 1 shoes, the Ballistix mid in red, silver and white. He wears them everywhere. However, they squeak! All the time! When we are in a quiet place, he just wants to take them off. He hates the noise they make. I suppose it is because the uppers are made of some synthetic material, but the noise is annoying! DOes anyone else notice this? Is there a way to quiet them down? Will the noise go away when the shoes are broken in? My son now wants to throw them away...."
2,"Easy On The Pockets, Murder On The Ankles","These kicks don't have any shock protection. Every time I went to the basket or dunked the ball, I was scared of landing because my ankles would start killing me. I had to go to the car and change shoes. Buyer beware. The price is good, but the product isn't."
1,Not all that it's cracked up to be,"This shoe is comfortable, but it isn't all that it's cracked up to be. It rubs the backs of your heels a lot and causes blisters that will re-open and bleed. So unless you wear two pairs of socks or figure out something, you're screwed."
1,CIPA hitch step,this step has a nifty look but the hinge pins broke the 2nd time it was used... resulting in a fall
5,good bowls,"Great quality for the price. Work fine in the microwave and no problem in dishwasher. We like these bowls so much, we bought a second set."
3,Beautiful bowls,"I like the design and clear color of these bowls. I was greatly disappointed to discover a manufacturing flaw, a dip in the top edge of one of the bowls. The flaw is not dangerous, but I will probably not use it. It is just too much trouble to send it back, but I will use and enjoy the other two."
2,Volatile - DO NOT BUY,"The first time I used this product to make Jello, the glass exploded. The description says oven safe. The description is obviously wrong."
5,Buy these American made classics,"I remember 20 years ago when I was looking at this set of bowls in the store, I told myself ""yeah, they're pretty nice but they'll get broken...""...and here I am today telling you that these bowls aren't just a pretty face! They are all 3 still with me and still my 'go to' bowls, for serving, eating and mixing. They are especially great for microwaving a quick meal of chili or soup from leftovers when I don't want to worry about the chemical issues of heating in plastic bowls.These beauties are a little bit scratched from many years of wear and tear, but have earned a place in my heart as one of the good things in my life. Do yourself a favor and get these."
4,Like em,"I got these because I dont have a stand mixer and needed taller bowls. These are quite tall and nice and heavy duty. I dont see them breaking easily. Only downside is that theyre all pretty close to the same size. But they work for me, I fully recommend."
5,Very Nice Bowl Set,"These bowls are shaped very well, they are obviously of high quality, and their price was very reasonable."
5,Perfect for center clamp,"Ever glue up a large panel, hoping all the clamps and cauls around the outer edge would provide even clamping pressure in the center of the panel? Tired of tying to use spreaders that dont fit?This clamp hooks into standard Bessey K Body or Trademen bars, and provides good solid clamping pressure to panel edges or Centers. The dual-clamp is far more balanced than it's single ended sister clamp. Can also be used as a spreader attachment.Having 3-4 of these now, I use them with almost every large-format glue up.They may work on other bars, but I only like Bessey and have sold off all others I've tried. Buy clamps once - Buy Bessey."
2,Just wont fit,"its stylish, but i'm a big guy, with a big head and the ""one size fits all"" just does not suits me. I thought it might be stretcheable but no,and I just end up looking funnier than usual. I would recommend to sell more sizes. Thanks"
3,what u pay for,This hat was small for my head. The material does not stretch. It's not a bad product for the price.
1,terrible!,"This is the worst children's music I have ever heard. My children, ages 4, 2 and 1 don't even like it. It sounds as if it were recorded in someone's closet with a [low price] toy keyboard. I am very disappointed in it."
5,Best Album Ever,"My grandpa got me this album when I was a kid and to this day I still listen to it. The narrator sounds sooooooooooo funny that I cannot stop laughing whenever I listen to this CD. This is pure comedy and it is the funniest thing ever! I recommend getting this! ""That fear comes from the deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeevil"" is the funniest part ever on the track ""God Has Not Given Us The Spirit Of Fear"""
2,chased away my finches,This type of food is too big to be accessed by birds using a standard mesh type tube finch feeder
1,Don't waste your money,"The plus side of this purifier is that it looks nice and is compact enough to stay out of the way.... if you are looking for a useless and expensive piece of equipment that gathers dust. It worked for about 2 months, and we cleaned it and took good care of it. After two months the clean light came on and would not go off despite numerous attempts to thoroughly clean it and reset it. We thought it might just be a defective one, but after a little research we found that a lot of people have the same problem with this brand. The company was of no help either. Unfortunately we held onto it for too long (trying to fix it) that we couldn't return it. It was the biggest waste of money. I would not recommend it to anyone, nor would I recommend purchasing items from this company. I only gave it one star because I have to rate it with some value for the review to be created."
5,Wow- the grey chicken likes it!,"I ordered this perch for our Timneh African Grey. After sitting it outside of her cage for a few days, I dared to add it to her cage. After several more days of avoiding that side of the cage totally, she ventured onto the perch. And discovered that it did not eat parrots. In fact, that crazy human left a rope to shred on it! And, there is food on the end if she tries hard enough! And, beads! Wow! This is great! Or, that is what I assume she would say if she could say more than "" I'm a bad bird. Don't bite.""She really does seem to enjoy it. It cleans up easily, is easy to remove and replace, and the foraging thing at the end is a good way to get your bird started with foraging. My only complaint is that the color is well, reminiscent of something that is usually delivered in a plain brown wrapper, if you know what I mean. It is a light pink color. Yeah. It looks like that."
3,JLA: Rules of Engagement,"My biggest concern with this book is that is not a complete Joe Kelly/Doug Manhke work. There's a short story from other writer, and you can see right away is not Kelly.On the ""Rules of..."" story arc you can see Kelly's mojo going on again. He have the ability to put the most powerful superheros in tough spots. That's what I love the most from Joe Kelly. The fact thet a lot of the book is penciled by another person (that's not Manhke) it makes it a not so good ride for me.Don't get me wrong, the art is not bad, but is not Manhkeristic, if you know what I mean.This one is not bad, but is not good either. At least not fantastic. If you can get this, try to get it at a very low price."
5,A True Gem!!,"It is incomprehensible that ""The Need To Be"" has not been released on CD or SACD, etc. for that matter. It is an understated masterpiece on many levels. All the songs are wonderful and the singing is sweet and personable. The instrumentation by Chuck Mangione & Co. is superb and very well suited to the singer's style. The sound is first class to boot; one of many A & M record gems from that period. The absolute highlight for me is the cover of Michel Legrand's, ""You Must Believe In Spring""! Wuuunderful!!!"
3,okay,California Baby is a great product but the tote did not come with everything that was described. It had 9 items just not the same 9 items mentioned in the description.
3,"Great products, sample size bottles",I purchased this product after an article on the dangers of some sunscreen ingredients. Received in good time from Amazon. The bottles were so small and really meant more for just babies. I was hoping to have my teen use these products in his soccer bag.
2,Can't review products that I didn't receive!,It was pretty irritating to receive this 9-piece tote and find that substitutions had been made. Especially since the items replaced were the very ones we hoped to sample. Really not impressed. Haven't used any of the products yet. Will update.
5,Exellent Catch,"I bought these as a gift for my mother, but when i got them, i compared it to my old rusted baking sheets, and i made them right at home in my kitchen. They are durable and don't rust, and they are great for the amount of money i paid. This is a great deal, They cook everything evenly and i love them."
1,HORRIBLE SET OF BAKEWARE,This is the worst bakeware set I've ever purchased!! It warps in my oven and worst of all has started to rust after washing them. No matter what way I wash...dishwasher of by hand it rusts. Not impressed and will never purchase another set or even recommend them. Check things clearly before you buy.
2,small,These items are not as large as I thought. They are cake pans and just small. I thought they were cookie sheets and pizza pans from the picture.
2,cheap but...,"flimsy. mine started rusting after 2 months. but then again, what can one expect for this price?"
1,Non-stick coating is coming off!!!! That is going in our bodies!,"Sure, it bakes things evenly. Sure it cleans easily. HOWEVER, the non-stick coating is coming off! So, some we ingest, we eat, and some gets washed/scrubbed off! Yuck! I can only imagine what it is doing to our bodies, our hearts, our brains, our babies, our children. No thanks, I am done with this stuff--"
1,Probably Unsafe,"I have been using these pans for a couple months and the non-stick material is coming off on my food making it inedible. Don't waste your money on these, and get glass."
2,Broke in just over 6 months,I purchased this as my daughter's first clarinet and at first was very pleased with it. The clarinet was relatively secure within the case and was easy to assemble and disassemble. Everything worked great...for about 6 months. The problems started with the sound; notes started sounding higher pitched than they should and there was a background wheezing sound. By the 7 month mark the keys broke while my daughter was putting it together. I know that this is a relatively low priced clarinet so I knew it wouldn't be as great as a $300 model - but I thought it would at least last the year!
4,good clarinet,"good clarinet, it came to us as described. we were able to put it together and use it right away"
2,Hisonic clarinet,Clarinet is good for price. Case is poor quality as the handle fell off case the first time my daughter took it to school.
4,Great for beginners,"This clarinet is a great buy for those who are learning to play or those who are looking to pick it up again. I wanted to relearn the clarinet and was looking for an inexpensive instrument. This fit all my needs. It has a good sound and no frills. One reed was also ready and waiting for me in the small, lightweight carrying case."
3,Can't Play a Lick,"I should say that I've never picked up a clarinet before, and have no proven musical ability. It looked nice, but the thing was so hard to blow air through that I thought it had to be defective. After a week or so I sold it to someone with clarinet experience, and she said the instrument was great!I therefore gave this a neutral 3-star rating. If you've never played a wind instrument before, take it from me, you'll need professional instruction -- before you buy anything. If you already know how to play the clarinet, this is apparently a good value for beginners or perhaps even intermediates."
4,Hisonic Signature Series 2610 Bb Orchestra Clarinet with Case,This is a basic clarinet suitable for Junior High Band. It fits the bill nicely.I had no interaction with the seller (Electronnix) other than them shipping the item. It arrived on time and in good condition.I would recommend this to anyone needing an inexpensive (but good) clarinet for beginning band.
3,good,"It is a great beginner one. I played in high school and some in College. I sold my old one, and it has been about 10 years since then. I wanted to start playing again and my son is going into the 6th grade. I thought we would both get good use out of it. It plays nice,but when you play middle E,and F, it sounds very airy, and when you put it together you have to be super careful not to break it. It was not as nice as my Yamaha, but is was not nearly as expensive either. It only comes with one no name reed and it is on the mouth piece. Mine came with an extra barrel???"
1,Hisonic Signature Series 2610 Clarinet,Clarinet was difficult for my daughter to play. Band teacher said it was junk. Guess you get what you pay for. Company gave a quick refund which was much appreciated.
2,Hard to Blow,"I purchased this for my daughters first year of band. While she managed to get through the year ok- the clarinet was very difficult to blow for some reason. Even her teacher agreed - he switched mouthpieces with his own and tried it out and found it was difficult for him too. Now that she has decided to stick with band, I will have to buy another new clarinet this year - of higher quality I guess."
4,More than you expect,"Let's be honest--the first chair clarinet player in the London Philharmonic isn't considering this $130 clarinet. But for my 9 year old daughter? It is perfect.The instrument looks good, plays in tune, everything works. The case is solid, protective and light weight. It comes with a couple of useful accessories. The only part that seems cheap is the ligature (the clamp-like device that holds the reed on), but it works. It is easily replaced and not expensive ($20 for a much better one--here:Rovner Clarinet Ligature 1R).Shipping was fast, item arrived in good shape.All for what it would have cost to rent a similar-quality beater clarinet for 5 months. Maybe she'll stick with it longer! Who knows?"
5,happy customer,My 12 year old daughter loves this clarinet! She was so excited to recieve it. we had rented one from school and she was super excited to get this gift. she started playing it right out of the box and it sounded ten times better than the one from school. Great product for the price. Was shipped on the date that was stated in great condition!
4,Pretty Good,"Margo Perkins does a pretty good job at showing her readers the activism with in each of the political autobiographies (Davis, Shakur and Brown). She gives the historical as well as the political situations that sparks these black radicals to write their stories in order that they might set the record straight and speak out against what the government and regular citizens have said about them that was not true (well, not Brown). All though Dr. Perkins' book was good in that it educated her readers, I felt as though she spent a little too much time telling us that Brown fabricated her stories and distorted her facts. I thought that chapter could have been condensed. But other than that it was a good book. You'll definitely walk away much smarter!"
5,Economical,These are very economical and easy to use. I use them for music lists and put back to back sheets in them. They work great.
5,For the price - good deal,"When I first took them out of the box, I noticed that they are rather flimsy and not very bright. But for the price they are excellent. I do not know how long they can last before the holes get torn out of the binder rings but till then they do their job."
1,Brother MFC,"I was fooled by the multi-functionality of the product, learning only the hard way that the head only has three months warranty. To replace it will cost $250+, now I have (an expensive) boat anchor!!"
5,Great CD,"This is a terrific CD with totally fresh music from Jane, livelier than her previous album - Red Dragonfly. She has always been a great flute/soprano sax artist. She plays both on this album. I have seen her on many occasion live and have many of her CD's. This is definitely one of her best works. This CD also contained some guitar which is also nice. Look forward to Volume 2."
2,"overwrought, overdone, overwhelming","After reading the other reviews on amazon.com, my view as follows will clearly be in the minority. Nonethless, I think the other side of this book needs to be stated--it is way too long, far too detailed, and so loaded down with unnecessary background that I frankly lost sight of ol' Pancho. In frustration I turned to the Encyclopedia Britanica and in about ten minutes learned more about Villa and his times than I did in the first extremely dense 400 pages of Katz's book.It is because of overdone books like this that so many people today refuse to read history. If I could I'd like to get my $29 back!"
1,History is in the telling,"Mr. Katz is no story teller. I have no doubt he worked hard and did many hours of research, which dedication is commendable, perhaps, but he did not get the story on the page. The reader of this work is presented with a tome. It is pedantic and formidable and flat, and many of its author's historical conclusions are dead wrong, research or no research. I would suggest to Mr. Katz that he direct his efforts to less tumultuous historical climates in future--Austria, for example--and stay out of the Mexican deserts."
5,The most comprehensive work on Pancho Villa,"""The Life and Times of Pancho Villa"" is the most complete source for information regarding this internationally recognized Mexican warrior. Katz, unlike other authors, gives a complete biography of the man, his myths and his legacy; as well as the geopolitical background corresponding to the periods of Villa's life. Both as a historian and a mexican, I feel that this is the one piece of literature that is completely indispensable for anyone that wants to know what happened during the so-called ""mexican revolution"" at the beginnings of the century and how this situation fits in with the rest of the world at this time. (i.e. The first World War)Quite simply, I feel that this comprehensive book is definitely worth a deep read, yet it also satisfies those curious people who are in for a quick browse."
5,Must-read on CPFR,One of the must-reads on CPFR. In-depth knowledge and analysis. I like the compilation of the most well known expert and case studies
4,Great Pop title....good music!,"Really good music through the entire CD and I really like listening to each and every song on the CD. Definitely, a good title for any fan of Paula Cole. I do recommend this title to anyone who likes to hear pop music."
2,Not the Dallas Cowboys,"What is that song that goes,""where have all the cowboys gone"" about? Aside from the obvious concern over the whereabouts of ""the cowboys""? And I'm assuming she is not referring to the cowboys in Dallas because they aren't really cowboys, but I don't think I should be the one to break the news to her. She is clearly upset. And by she, I mean the singer, because I don't know the actual name of the girl who sings that song. I don't even know how I heard that song in the first place. Was that on the radio? I hated that song. Whenever she'd roll into the chorus with her ""where have all the cowboys gone"" questions, I'd always think, who gives a hoot? Really?"
5,A beautiful CD,"How many of us have bought a CD just to be bummed that there are only a few songs we enjoy, Or a few fast ones that upset the flow of the mellow ones we had begun to relax to? This one is a relaxing, beautiful, enjoyable experience from begining to end. This has become one of my favorites."
1,This book is very outdated,"This is a textbook that would be better suited to a class of fourteen-year-olds, not to college level students. The graphics, activities, and the book in general, is not on a college level, and should be removed from the curriculum by all College professors."
1,one of the worst albums in existence,"this cd (and band also) is horrible. the lyrics are some of the worst garbage i'e ever read. anyone whos been playing guitar for about 6 months could write the simple songs this band writes. the drumming isn't good either, the bass isn't good, the singer writes horrible lyrics like ""I had a dream last night and in my dream I robbed a country club. A 5 year old tried to stop me, but I shot him through the head, and now he's dead."" and ""I should've known that you were a killer. But now I'm dead."" those lyrics are awful! why do so many people like this band? the singer has a horrible voice too! if there was a rating lower than 1 star, this cd would get it. and people who think this band is good don't know anything about real music and talent."
5,More stars if I could!,I loved this EP! I saw Senses Fail last year Fall of 2003 with MxPx and was addicted to them from that show. I searched everywhere for this EP and finally this past summer found it. It is still in heavy rotation in my CD player. I think they are one of the best upcoming bands that we will be hearing a lot more from long as they stick to the music! They are younger so I hope they don't flop out as a lot of great bands do! If you like punk driven background with emo lyrics and a little of both on some songs then this CD is for you! I listened to the clips of the songs and although they are clips you can get an idea of their sound from it. I hope that they join the Warped Tour line up this year that would be great...been looking forward to seeing them again!
5,two words 1 band .. Senses Fail,this is senses fails first cd and if you are a senses fail fan its a must own its a little different from let it enfold you and obviously a lot different from their newer stuff i am a big senses fail fan and love the this whole album even if your not a senses fail fan this is a great one to have and if you've never heard of senses fail and have just stumbled its a good buy
3,Good Starting Point,"...this has a definite sound of finch in it, if you like them, you'll like this, its that simple. the songs arnt written as well as some of finch's but if you need more this is a good place. my problems come from some truely uninspired lyrics(esp. on the song steven(01) the ""acoustic"" version of the ground folds (they need to rename this track, the only thing it has incommon with the reg. version is most the lyrics)if you are into album art, this one has top=teir art, very good job on that front.but this is a cd that you can wait on, get their full length when its out, by them they should be more refined, until then, listen to the following to get your emo-core fix:finchmy chemical romancethursdatboysetsfireThricetaking back sundayfurther seems forever"
3,actually 3.5 stars,"Overrated, the guitars are nothing special,average. The songs do get boring after a while.I thought it was good at first, but I got sickof it fast. Too bad everybody is riding thebands di$ks. I do like the backup screaming ,FAIL is not in the same league as Thursday orsome of the other bands. Let your friends get it first to see if you like first or want some new music . I had high expectations since my budding told me they were awesome, I was a little let down ."
4,"I like Senses Fail, so say what you will-- I don't care.","I liked Bloody Romance when I first heard it on Launch (and I still really enjoy it). And I listened to the 30 second samples, but I wasn't too impressed. I ordered the CD because I have friends who enjoy it and, we all share similar music taste. So I figured I would give them another chance.I like this EP, infact... I like it a lot. I didn't give it 5 stars because I do find some of the lyrics to be a little lame. But I'm not by any means bashing this band, like these other people... who call it cliche and unoriginal. It's neither of the two.I defiantly wouldn't suggest it for a music snob. But if you like songs you can just get hyped about, like-- for when you're getting ready to go out. Then it's definatly worth the money and you should buy it right now."
2,Bland,"This band is very generic, and well, boring. Incase you haven't noticed this ""screamo-punk"" music is on the rise and the market is being flooded with bands that can pull these kind of tunes off well. So, if you are a new band to the scene, you had better be able to do something very special or you will be labeled ""run of the mill."" That is exactly what Senses Fail is, run of the mill. And unless they come to grips with their current status among anyone who has good taste in music at all, they will probably never be anything more than average when at their very best. ""Bloody Romance,"" and ""One Eight Seven,"" have some replay value, that is about it. Verdict-42/100"
5,From the Depths of Dreams = GREAT EP.,"Senses Fail is truly a breath of the freshest air I've heard in a long time! They have meaningful music that actually rocks. This EP is one of the best CD's that I have ever purchased. Each song is so refreshing in it's own, unique way...01. Steven = 10/1002. Free Fall Without A Parachute = 9/1003. Bloody Romance = 10/1004. Dreaming A Reality = 9/1005. The Ground Folds = 10/1006. One Eight Seven = 10/10! <-- Best Song On Here!07. Handguns And Second Chances = 10/1008. The Ground Folds [Acoustic] = 10/10 <-- Even Better Than Before!So as you can tell, I recommend this EP HIGHLY!!! It's a steal for the price it is. Buy it, I'm telling you, you will 99.9% love it. Take heed though, if you do not like Screamo, then you won't like Senses Fail. But if you do, you've just found a new favorite band. I <3 them!"
5,DRIVE THRU'S NEWEST BAND IS ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!!,this debut ep cd is awesome! words can't describe the talent this new band has. They are different from your other punk pop drive thru bands.Their punk hardcore melodies and morbid lyrics make a great combination. Senses fail and The early november are by far the best bands on drive thru. I can't wait for the full length to come out!
5,Get Ready For Some Heart Throbing Punk Rock!,"Hmm, when a CD is only 5.99 what is the first thing that comes to your mind. Is it ""crap music that no one in the right mind would buy"", or is it ""Must be a cool CD or it would'nt be on sale"". Well I chose to go with the second one, and it was almost the best decssion I've ever made with music. Everything about this CD is spectacular. From the way he screams to even the catchy lyrics. They're a terrific band and need to come out with the actual CD. The lyrics are so cool, they're a punk rock band that sings about eating out peoples hearts. It dosent really fit the music but it sounds great. In my opinion the best song is either ""187"" or ""Free Fall Without a Parachute"", but the whole EP is great. I can't wait to see them at the Warped Tour. If you hate punk give it a chance, you may just like it. I have freinds that listen to Slipknot that like them. Tell all of you'r freinds about Senses Fail, and buy this EP."
3,It's purdy good,"Senese Fail is an awesome band but their new CD kicks this one's ass big time. Senese Fail is like my fav emo band probaly out of all of them. THe sing cool, their screames aren't annoying like some emo bands (such as thursday, they suck) and they are catchy. ANd their lyrics make you think and have meaning to it. If you want Senses Fail at their best get their new full length album ""Let this unfold you"". If you like emo that is melodic, catchy, and sort of punk influenced than get their new album. If you like Senese Fail a lot than get this one to."
1,BARF!,"This band sucks; I've said it before. WHATS THE POINT AT LOOKING AT THESE REVIEWS ANYMORE? I'm probably one of a few minority that rates bad music as well as good; what the hell do people look at this for: the only morons that review this crap are 13 year old boys and girls who think because this band pulls off a couple of chords does the scream-sing thing they're god. The icing on the cake would have to be the tight shirts *snicker-giggle*; because ""WHO would want to listen to guys with LONG hair? THAT IS LIKE... SOOOO 90'S! EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT FROM THE 90'S."" I'm sick of these freaking poser bands working off a genre, and saying: ""We don't like to categorize ourselves."" YOU JUST DID! Every band like this I know says that! The only good band on Drive-Thru was The Movielife, and some of the stuff Finch did. This is just another one of those bands that has the ""deep"" but shallow lyrics that every other billion type of these bands have with the long, but not ""too long"" hair. Whack."
1,"Stop with the annoying cliches, puns, double entendres, etc.","You do realize that if you give this album a 5 that you are saying it is on the same level as albums such as Gun's and Roses -Appetite for Destruction, Use Your Illusion 1 and Alice in Chains - Dirt. Under no circumstances will a generic EP that made no influence on any other bands deserve a 5. There is no arguement about it. In fact they were influenced greatly by others. Even if you love this band, you can't justify it being as good as Pearl Jam's Ten, which is a sure fire 5. Unfortunately half the kids don't know who these influential bands are :(Don't buy this ep unless you are going to burn it. If i was rich I would personally destroy all copies of this. It would be well worth it."
1,not good,"(...)this cd lacks originality omg its very cliche.this souinds just like any other stupid ""EMO"" band these guyz arent emo or nething they suck all the songs sound litteraly exactly the same. its pathetic. no emotion and HORRIBLE SCREAMING on song 5 or 6 or watever song is called 187. CHECK OUT: atreyu, further seems..,COHHED AND CAMBRIA, armor for sleep, thrusday, thrice, or harder bands like AS I LAY DYING orEvergreen Terrace."
3,its ok??,i borrowed this cd from a friend had never hearing them but hearing about them. i was going to burn it until i gave it a listen. i was like these guys are ok but they are nothing special and had ended up giving it back to her by the end of the day. these guys are nothing bad by the least bit but nothing that just blows my mind but give it a try and u might like it. it seems to me most everyone else did.word.
2,Ehh....,"I listened to this record a lot hoping that it would grow on me... it hasn't, actually, now I can't even stand it- I guess it's mostly the singers voice and the pop sound of the album. Yeah, there's some catchy stuff, but if you're into the musical aspects like guitar, etc, then don't buy it."
3,Super Screamo but lacking lyrics!!!,"I bought this CD right after hearing the song '187' on a friends Drive Thru DVD. After this song started playing in my dreams, i decided that it was time to see what these ""Senses Fail"" boys could offer. All in all, they've got great chords, melodies and over all beats, but the screeching and Emo-forced lyrics of frontman Buddy aren't that of which you'd be serenated with in a saves the day album. On the converse, the song '187' is magnificent and will probably have profound effects on any Juvenile, desolate-feeling punkster. Other great tracks are the acoustic version of ""The grounds Fold"" and ""Free Fall Without A Parachute"". Other then that, it's gonna take a while for you to distinguish one track from another!"
5,A moving biography,"Romulus, My Father is about how a kindhearted and truthful man taught his son the meaning of life and its values, what to expect and what to feel. He gave he's son a chance to witness first hand through his life about friendship and the joy of life. The self-respect and self-gratification of being able to work. Romulus teaches his son of passion, infidelity and in the end how to cope with mental illness as a man. Setting a true example by being able to survive the true hardship of living and working in a foreign country."
1,Comfy but doesn't last,"I bought this while waiting for my mattress to be delivered, and ending up sleeping on it anyway. It is very comfy. However, beware - it would not hold air at all after 2 months. It was only used indoors and on top of another mattress and there are no holes or worn spots. ( I also weigh only 110 lbs) The company has a 1 yr warranty, but the toll free number they list on their web site is a soft porn chat line and the other number doesn't work. No luck with email yet - it is rather expensive item for it to work for such a short time, and if it doesn't hold air when used indoors, on top of a mattress, covered and protected, I hardly think it would be useful for camping. The company also has various other websites (their real name is AA outdoors network) - they have no record in the Better Business Bureau and display the safe bond seal on several of their web sites when they are not listed with safe bond either."
4,"Fun, quick, easy but noisy when pumping","I purchased two of them after the first one full size completely wow me when it deflated quickly in few minutes. The fun part is it can adjust up and down the head rest. After finishing pumping air, it hold air pretty good and the material plus the tough surface makes the bed firm and steady...even my son jumped on it and still no leaking air or any sign of loosing its firmness. Queen size is the second one i purchase, a little disappointment though 'cause the level on both side of the bed not even when raising the head rest. The firmness not as good as the full size. I wish manufacture should put a stronger e-pump to make the job easier and faster. Amazon shipped it out quick...cool."
2,I was disappointed,"The writing of this book harks back to the early days of cattlemen and Wyoming ranches. I was delighted to read these episodes including ones about my family members.However, the disappointment came from production of the book -- first published mid 1930s and recently republished. The republished edition was flawed in both copies I purchased -- I returned the first, but kept the second and hope to eventually find an original edition and a copier in the same location."
4,if you love bootsy it's worth getting,"not casper's best effort the rubber band was starting to break up as was the whole p funk empire we know bootsy and george had drug habits but they was'nt the only guilty ones anyway oh boy gorl was the weakest song on here but the other songs are okay bootsy was'nt that thrilled with this album and he does'nt like it you get to hear his wild space bass for those wildf casper faNS WHO CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BOOTSY PLAYING BASS BUT shejam, jam fan, chug a lug, and bootsy get live are worth having those are typical bootsy jams a shame prince, zapp and roger picked up on this formula and ran with it thrloughout the 80's."
3,Just OK,"I purchased this for my Macaw....he was not crazy about it...it picked through and found stuff to eat, but I would not recommend this mix for a large parrot. Great price but less than average mix."
2,a good idea the night before,"I bought this based on limited reviews and hearing a few sound samples (available on another web site) and now am wishing I could get my money back. Musically the album is not bad. Good guitar playing and vocals that sound like a mix of Grace Slick and Dale Evans are kind of engaging. The main problem is the lyrics which seem like they were concocted after a night of smoking weed. Yes they rhyme, but that might be part of the problem since most of the songs sound predictable and just dumb. To me they seem like amateur stuff in the light of morning. This one will end up in the shoebox for trade-in or resale."
2,didnt work,I got this product thing it would help my slice and drive it longer didnt do any of that. After about 2 swings i figured out how to swing it without breaking i thought i had it down i grab my driver and did the same swing and i stilled had a bad slice not worth the money anyone wants to buy t minea for sale
1,A MINUS 5 STAR TO AMAZON,How is that Amazon want to do business and get reviews on a given product if it doesn't list the content. Nobody is going to buy a CD if the content is not revealed. Are you going to do something about it?
5,A Classic Book to Keep and Treasure !,"This book is the most heart-felt book that I have in my collection. The characters make you feel that you are there with them. The way Roanne loves Webb but still thinks that she can't measure upto Jessie. The way the family thinks about having Webb back but knowning they can't do anything about it. The secret lover, what will he do now that Webb is back? You will either love this book for it's love story or for the mystery, but you'll love it. I wish there was more stars to award it but there would still not be anuff.Please buy it because it is the best read in long time."
1,A reprint.,"I bought this book in the mid 90s.I didn't like it then and I'm unlikely to change my mind.The woman was a doormat, and the man a jerk.I have all Linda Howard's books, and enjoyed the rest, but this one didn't measure up."
2,Likable aspects far over shadowed by the ugly,"I found the first 100 pages of this book slow and meadering. I kept wondering when the romance would start. Roanna and Webb soon ""got together"" but it was not at all romantic.That scene at the hotel was very off putting, as was most sexual aspects of this story. There were too many and too detailed scenes featuring Neely, especially the one featuring incest. The one with Corlis and the lines of coke was also something I could have lived without.I also did not like the fact there were several sexual relationships between people who were closely related.I know that South is a different world. but I have got to think that it considered strange for a man to marry not one cousin, but two cousins, especially since they all grew up in the same house.I liked most of the dynamic between Roanna and Webb, but other, somewaht repulsive aspects of the book really took away from their story and my enjoyment of this book."
5,Wonderful!,"One of my fave Linda Howard books (not dissimilar to After the Night).This book is wonderful! It's about unrequited love, devotion, second chances and good coming out on top!I always go back to this book when I want a bit of a cry, Roanna has so many trials in life, but her perseverance is inspiring!The book has a solid story and mystery running though that along with the well developed characters and the in-depth emotions of the novel keep the story flowing... fast.If I could give it more stars I would!"
2,All in the Family,"I grew up in the south, but I had a real problem with the second cousins marrying. Yuk! Two people who had gradmothers who were sisters and grew up in the same house, growin up and falling in love is gross. If I grew up with a cousin in the same house, they would be like a brother to me, not a love interest! I thought the book had way too many incestuous relationships and was disturbing. Family is family and you don't marry each other!"
1,Only read first 59 pages,I read the first 59 pages and decided the book was not for me. If you enjoy reading about insecestious relationships you will like this book.
1,Rape & Incest by page 44...YUCK!,"I continued a bit further though but I just can't get into kids (cousins) being raised together (in the same house) marrying, etc. And if that did not feel incestuous enough a father and daughter carry on an affair. Another yuck! The hero is a door mat (no spine - everyone is mean to her and she takes it) and the hero --- well I don't know if he got better -- I stopped by page 130 or so."
2,Grossly incestuous,"*Some spoiler alert*I'm pretty baffled by all these rave reviews since they usually don't go wrong by me. I just have to say that this book is as ""rednecked"" as you can get where first cousins are marrying each other, daughter and father intercourse, second cousins making out... There were some psychological aspects and disorders to this book that although we study it, it's just not something I would read for fun (ie the Lolita syndrome). What I usually get off of Linda Howard's books is that she tries to be as realistic a possible where relationships go but the author pretty much overstepped this to the point where it wasn't enjoyable for me."
5,Genetics issue,"I wanted to take a moment to respond to some of the reviewers who found the idea of Roanna and Webb being cousins, even though they were lovers planning to marry, a little creepy. As someone with a little background in genetics, I can tell you that two people who share only great grandparents in common are not very closely related genetically; hardly more than two strangers. So relax; their relationship is not incestuous."
5,LINDA HOWARD HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!,"This book is almost as good as Linda Howards ""Into the Night."" Webb is one... hunk! The love scene will knock your socks off! I loved the ending of the story! Read this book, and enjoy!"
3,Okay,"I liked the characters of Roanna and Webb. Not much of a storyline for me. I, too, could not get past the scenes of Jessie and her father. The ending deserves 5 stars, as I did not see that coming. I usually can figure out ""who did it"" in the middle of a book. Too much sex without that much content. If you want a true love story with a roller coaster of a ride that will keep your heart pumping read Paradise by Judith McNaught."
1,No Understanding of Women Writers,The characters talk and think and behave in a manner so foreign to me and I'm sure most people raised in the thirties. Am having a hard time relating to the current crop of female writers.
4,"loved it ,",I read 5 in a row and i dont get tired of her writing she keeps you interested in the people of the book. im looking for another.
2,Am I too much of a Midwesterner??,"I love Linda Howard, but cannot believe people gave this book 5 stars. Cousins sleeping together and marrying...is this what the South is like? Is this how families hold on to property?Granted,the mystery was great -- but the father/daughter sex was just too weird (and enjoyed by them too much)."
3,WAY too much inner-dialogue---,"Seventy-five percent of this story was the hero and heroine's REPETITIVE inner-dialogues. Say it once and move on...please! The two may have been ""kissing-cousins,"" but they spent most of their time apart. The whole incest-thing was not as dark as I got from other reviews as the story did not go in to too much detail and it only involved two extremely sleazy adults who would have been a danger to barnyard animals. (Actually, what I found to be just a tad creepy was the heroine's total and consuming obsession toward the hero practically since her birth.) The murderer was obvious if your roots are deep enough in the South, but the reason behind it was such a prosaic letdown. There were so many more imaginative possibilities. I found After The Night an intriguing Southern story by this author. Narrator was fine."
4,Computer Shorthand: Speed building and Real-time transcription,"The book was in excellent condition -- like brand new. I received it in a timely manner, and am very pleased with the seller.Thank you"
4,Another Day in the Frontal Lobe:A Brain Surgeon Exposes Life on the Inside,"Other than the fact that the title was too long and a little too much like an expose, I really enjoyed the book. Our family experienced an extended time with neurosurgeons last year and I could relate to a lot of what goes on in the book. I was glad that she was technical enough without going overboard in her explanations. I think she did a good job showing the struggle neurosurgeons have dealing with an area of medicine that has so many twists and turns with such a wide range of outcomes."
1,Offensive!,"I am in the medical field myself and love good books about patient stories and life in the medical world. This book was for the most part boring to begin with but I stopped reading when the author began criticizing those who believe in religion. This was very inappropriate and didn't have anything to do with neurosurgery. I would've given zero stars if possible. I suggest ""When the air hits your brain"", a much better read and no offensive opinions."
2,This Could Have Been a Great Book,This had the potential to be a great book. It would have been had the author waited a few years and gotten some real experience. It's painfully evident that -- taking nothing away from her achievements -- she just does not have the depth to take hold of this subject and keep it moving in good order. I felt as if I were listening in on her cell phone conversations.
4,Balancing a Brain with a Knife,"Dr. Firlik's description of the womb-to-tomb process of becomming a neurosurgeon was a delight to explore. Just like with the three bears, it wasn't too hard and wasn't too soft --- it is a just-right-read for anybody wanting to know the behind-the-scenes requirements on what it takes to become a brain surgeon. Dr. Firlik shows that, ""...recalibrating patients' thinking ..."" is as much an art as it is a technical science. Well done.Paul J. Friday, PhDChief, Clinical PsychologyUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center - ShadysideAuthor: Friday's Laws: How to Become Normal When You're Not and How to Stay Normal When you Are"
3,a dissapointment,"The author spends a great deal of time talking about being one of the few women in her field: and yet, she is not in private practice anymore and is a high priced researcher. Why? What made her leave. I was looking for a read on women in surgery especially the more male dominated fields. Insead of wasting my money (thanks though to amazon, not a lot), I could have easily gained the same insight by watching some classic er reruns. There are better books out there that examine the patriarchy more, the impacts of neurosurgery more and the impacts on a long term career. But the book is good for a 2 hour flight if you want something more than a murder mystery."
3,Despite Stream of Conscious Writing... I liked this book,"Despite Dr. Firlik's stream-of-conscious writing style, I found that her subject matter is excellent. I'm very frustrated with her writing style - she's all over the place with all kinds of side notes, flash backs, and other off-subject tales. However - I can't stop reading this book because I love learning about the human brain, medical technology, and the female perspective of life in a male-dominated career."
1,Thank God (big G) I checked it out from the library.,"I'm a trauma nurse. I work with female neurosurgeons that make this author look like a saint, but that does not excue her from being narcisitic, snarky, and religously intolerant. It's truly a pity that she could not honor diversity and had to take a discriminatory attitude on those who sees things differently. This prevailing theme draws away from the intent of the book, or what i suspect is the intent. Perhaps her intent was to put those individuals down to make herself feel higher."
1,Arrogant and Annoying,"I am a student in the medical field and read a few books on the field especially of neurosurgery since I think it's really cool. The author just goes on and on about how great she is and how hard it is for her to be a ""brain surgeon"" and how she does what no one else can. She even makes fun of other doctors who glorify themselves in their book when she does the same exact thing, in fact a lot more that any other book I read. It seems to me that for most of the book the author is talking down to us. If you want to read a good book full of humor, humility read (When the Air Hits Your Brain: Tales from Neurosurgery) by Frank Vertosick Jr."
4,Good book,"This book does a great job of showing the neurosurgery world from the inside. My only complaint is that the author repeatedly implies that neurosurgery is one of the most desired and competitive residencies to get into. That may have been the case 10 years ago. But nowadays, very few students are interested in this field. And its not because they aren't passionate or qualified enough, as the author once states."
2,No heart,"I came here to write my review and see that many of the 1 and 2 stars already say what I want to say. But I'll write it anyway so that the negative tally goes up.The book is an interesting topic, but lacks any warmth or humanity. It's very sterile."
5,"Interesting, thoughtful, frank and well written","In this excellent book, shaped as a memoir, Dr. Firlik somehow manages to do several things at once - paint a genuine yet engaging picture both of the neurosurgical profession and her own life, present her well thought out opinions on several related issues like end of life treatment v.s. quality of death, religion, evolution and the future of neurosurgery and medicine (without being forceful about them, backed by interesting references) and even offers advice to patients on what to expect from and how to deal with doctors. The book is a great read and I am thankful to the author for helping me vicariously live the life of a neurosurgeon and experience almost everything associated with it."
1,Not all doctors are like this,"As a reader in a similar field to the author, I was hoping to read this book and be able to relate to the stories presented. Unfortunately this was not the case. I found the anecdotes and personal opinions rather embarrassing and narcissistic. The author expressed thoughts that some doctors may have fleetingly, but are able to self censor.There are many other good biographies and collections by medical practitioners full of humanity, humility and far more information. Try Oliver Sacks as recommended by the author!"
1,This is a struggle,"I really wanted to like this book, as I have a vested interest in the topic however, it just did not work for me - on so many levels.Not enough interesting patient stories, not enough anything really to hold my interest.There are other better books on this topic, I suggest you read them, not this."
2,Personality Gets in the Way,"I bought this books with the hope of being able to use it for a course I'm teaching. I guess I was expecting something more along the lines of Oliver Sacks (a high-bar to set expectations, I'll admit), and this book fell far short.The first chapter starts out with an interesting discussion of brain matter, but the chapters then devolve into random autobiographical tidbits which are meant to be amusing, but I get the feeling ""you had to be there.""Not recommended."
1,Disappointing,"Many of the positive reviews I've read of this book describe it as ""breezy."" I'm left with the impression that breezy is a euphemism for shallow. Potentially heavy and interesting stuff was glossed right over, and each paragraph hopped from subject to subject without any sort of narrative flow. Really, the whole book is just dumbed down.Also, while I understand the need for black humor among neurosurgeons, recounting these jokes to outsiders is tricky and clearly requires far more writing ability and sensitivity than displayed in Another Day. For brain-related black humor that actually works try Cathy Crimmons' Where is the Mango Princess."
5,Modest Genius Writes FIRST book!,"Dr. Katrina Firlik is as adept with a pen as she is with a scalpel!As she is one of the most fascinating people on the planet--this book is certainly worthy of your time and money.She smoothly blends together what makes her so unique, and cases that may 'shock and awe'.As a surgeon carefully plots a seamless operation, so does the author include all that is necessary, and excises what it is not.Five stars are not enough!"
1,Look carefully at the other reviews of this book. Notice a pattern?,"Look at the dearth of 5 star reviews for this book, and how they are so similar in character - they're perfectly written single paragraph blurbs, full of lofty praise, but don't go into the actual details of the book. They could so easily be paraphrases of the liner notes.Take another look at the one and 2 star reviews and see how much more they sound like the frustrations of people who actually read the book. They are telling the truth in my opinion. Dr. Firlik came across trite and unlikable. Sorry!"
2,Should be subtitled: I'm a Neurosurgeon and You're Not,"In a word: shallow. Not enough there for anyone who's interested in learning more about the brain, or anyone who's interested in becoming a neurosurgeon. It's just a recounting of her job in a somewhat smug tone. There are few facts, little compassion, and a lot of ego."
4,Another Day in the Frontal Lobe,"Great read. I work with a group of 6 neurosurgeon, one being female. Dr. Firlik shares some similar qualities as the female neurosurgeon who I work with. Neurosurgery is a remarkable career, especially for a woman."
3,Comparison to the earlier titles?,The first reviewer states that the sound on this set is better than on the first two discs which were released separately. Does anyone have both the original discs and the set and can comment on similarities/differences?
2,Live Album / The Early Fleetwood Mac band,"It wasn't obvious to me from the Amazon posting that this was a live CD from the first members of Fleetwood Mac. I enjoy the Peter Green era of the group, but given the looseness of the live play and the poor recording quality, it should only be for those who have a strong love of the very early work of the Peter Green version of the Mac. There is some nice guitar work and some un inspiring cameo work by Joe Walch and Eric Clapton. All in all, this only for serious collectors of early Mac."
5,Definitive MAC,"After buying several studio albums, you get the feeling that this was a band that was never captured in the studio in all its glory. Well, these recordings finally do it. THIS IS the Fleetwood Mac!"
4,"Great Live Album...and ""such a bargain!""","Three discs of absoutely scorching live rock and roll from the Fleetwood Mac lineup featuring the legendary Peter Green. No Nicks-Buckingham narcissism in this Fleetwood Mac: just terrific, straight-ahead 3-lead-guitar blues and rock. Over 3 1/2 hours of music to boot! I don't know what ""Boston Box"" the previous reveiwer was listening to, but this set is the real deal. And trust me, one does not have to be a Fleetwood Mac ""fanatic"" to appreciate just how truly wonderful these CDs are. Buy this!"
5,Boom Boom Satelites Rock,"Out loud is a must buy Cd. I bought the American release, and every song is awesome, and different. If you love any sort of techno/electronic music you'll love this CD. Out loud has something for every music fan hard hitting fast paced music, and mellow trance even mixed jazz samples. If nothing else find an MP3 sample of their music if you have any doubts."
4,Very comprehensive summary of most vintage/modern receivers,"Nearly 500 pages of pictures & data on most SW receivers built in North America & abroad. Contains basic specs & features, picture, descriptions, and data on when built, physical dimensions, and estimates on values. A must for collectors."
1,REFILL,THIS IS 2009 I order this to replace 2009. I need a 2010. I DO NOT UNDER STAND WHYTHEY ARE STILL SELL A 2009.
1,Advertised as 2009 but received 2010,Ordered this so that I'd be able to use my 2010 DayMinder for the rest of 2009. It WAS advertised as 2009 and we received a 2010.
1,Mary Mary Quite Contrary How Does Your Ignorance Grow,"This book is full of empty half truths and self deceptions. Mary doesn't address how she could possibly live off of her connections and her homosexuality (see gay outreach for Coors Brewery), while supporting an administration that is overtly hostile to gays and lesbians. She reaches the heights of hypocrisy when she rails against John Edwards and John Kerry for daring to mention her homosexuality during the debates in 2004. Somehow she forgets all the anti-gay marriage amendments and anti-gay campaign literature spewed forth from the Republican propaganda machine that propelled her ""sensitive"" father and his sterling running mate to victory. This book is a feeble attempt to cash in by an opportunistic and evidently self-loathing gay woman."
1,Please don't expect me to believe this,"Don't waste your money. I'm glad I borrowed this book to read from a family member.Take a moment to consider that a supposedly out and proud Gay women wants us to consider her side of the story when she stood by and let her father's administration use fear of the gay rights ""agenda"" to gain votes. Your turn, Mary? It ought to be an apology instead of this whiny, petty tome. Here's a news flash for you, Mary. You're gay. No matter how much money you have or hope to inherit, how much fame you achieve or how hard you work for the Republican platform, the agenda of your father's administration WILL ALWAYS BE AGAINST YOU. Wake up and write a book about that. Unless of course all the laws they hope to pass to take away the constitutional rights of gay citizens will have a Mary Cheney clause.You had your turn during the campaign to stand up and make a difference. You chose to be a sell out. Now shut up and live with it."
1,The perfect gift for Log Cabin Republicans,"This book chronicles the journey of a self-loathing Republican lesbian. I cannot imagine any other audience for the book except self-loathing LGBT persons. They can learn all about how to survive in today's Republican Party. Surely the rest of the LGBT community will not want the book and the rest of the Republican party hates her as much as the man she helped get elected does. I would recommend all Democrats not waste their time or, more importantly, their money. Mary's share of the $94,000,000 her father is reportedly worth is enough. This book should go straight(no pun intended) to the trash bin."
1,Pathetic,"I watched this woman defend her book and her cowardice on Letterman. She was prickly, unpleasant, and delusional. In her mind, she ""cannot afford"" to be a one-issue voter and thus the present administration was the ""best"" for the job--which she basically defined as, guess what? ONE issue: Terrorism. But what she doesn't confront in this book or in her interviews is that she is a second-class citizen. She is denied basic civil rights afforded straight Americans. Maybe she can't ""afford"" to be a one-issue voter--but that ONE issue, the inalienable right to be treated equally, is inherent to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" I came away disgusted with her, even as I tried to be open-minded about her politics. She is a coward, pure and simple, and the book is worthless. She is a traitor to Americans who want equal rights for all. She is a traitor to her sexuality. To her partner. And on top of it, she is sickeningly intolerant when she defends her views on television."
1,She makes her points well (ie 'uniter' not 'divider'),Mary's message in this book is extremely powerful. She lists reason after reason why we absolutely must support and encourage our President in these times of crisis. Her number one reason for supporting Bush was that he was a proved 'uniter' and not a 'divider'. Mary exemplifies this with her writing and her ability to join people together. [...]
1,Those who dispute ex-gay treatment - read the book!,"Mary Cheney has written the definitive book that debunks the current homosexual politically correct urban legend that they were born that way. Sorry, Mary has blown that lie sky high. Within the first chapter it becomes clear that this is a chosen lifestyle preference.Another point I give great credit to her on is that she argues that homosexuals are too focused in the elections on a single issue (ie their civil rights). Yet the selfishness they insist upon only makes normal society disgusted of their flamboyance. Mary is a model of tact and reticense in that she doesn't want to shove her lifestyle choice in our face like so many other alternative lifestylers. John Paulk makes some excellent points in a very poignant forward."
1,A new type of family values,"I found the book quaint but not an engaging read. Miss Cheney comes across as an elitist activist. I cannot for the life of me determine who the book was written for. While I respect her lifestyle choice, I agree with our President and others that she and her kind should not raise children."
1,Give me my time back..,"This is a bitter vanity piece that contributes nothing. Way to take a stand when your father is retiring soon and they have nothing to loose.The stuff about the Kerry debate remarks is laughable. Santorum compares you and your girlfriend to having sex a dog. Pat Robertson blames you, as a lesbian, for 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. Keyes calls you an immoral hedonist. Dobson says that you are unfit to raise a child, etc. But when Kerry mentions your sexuality he is out of bounds.This book is way worse than other conservative books because the author is such a hypocrite. I will be adding my copy to the used section vey soon."
1,Hollow Writing,"Many passages in this book seemed very hollow, almost devoid of human emotion. I expected a much more personal account and was disappointed in the almost sterile, if not somewhat bitter tone of this book. I cannot recommend it in good conscience."
2,"""Bizarre"" is what comes to mind....","So let me get this straight (no pun intended)... it was ""outrageous"" and ""infuriating"" for the Democrats to say that Mary Cheney was a lesbian -- injecting her personal life into the political sphere, but there was nothing wrong with George Bush using neo-nazi like homophobia to get votes, AND having Dick Cheney--whose own daughter is gay--stand buy and support this? Riiiight. This makes perfect sense."
1,Disturbing and venomous tone,"I was quite taken aback with the actual content of this book. I had expected a warm, family-oriented story. Instead, the writing is almost totally hateful and vindictive. Don't get me wrong, I abhore the liberal homosexual agendists, but I had assumed the Cheney daughter would take a more moderate tone. I don't care for a militant or strident lecture and that seemed to be the case. I am now somewhat confused as to why she wrote the book in the first place. Hopefully her father with come out with something with more gravitas."
1,Ms. Cheney's only talent is how to COMPLAIN!,"It seems that if one were to grow up in a family of wealth and power that they would have a positive outlook on life. Not so with Ms. Cheney. She spends almost the entire book telling about how mean people were to her on the campaign trail and whines constantly about the toils of politics.In addition, she missed a great opportunity to tell about the issues that confront an individual growing up gay in a conservative family. This along with the fact that the book must have been written by an 8th grader points to a poor read.I would give it zero stars if possible."
1,Lets Hit Harder Mary,I bought this book because I was really interested in Mary and her career. I stopped reading the book about half way through because it was very uneventful. Get a book that would be more interesting before you get this one. I wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing the book.
1,Chad Andrist,I have to say it was not what I expected by the title of the book. It says it her turn but she doesn't say anything you expect from a Gay person Trapped in a Republican Gay hating home. It is a waste of money. I wouldn't give it any stars. I was expecting a HARDER HiTTING BOOK. This was sure a waste. If you really want to read it wait till the library has it to read it.
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Mary Cheney [...] fails to address the most basic issues as to how she has been able to live as a Lesbian and at the same time support the most despotic anti-Gay administration in modern history. Her story line is trite, boring, and shallow. She lacks the basic self-reflection and introspection that make most ""memoirs"" great reads. You will learn nothing about Mary from this book and even less about her family and how they have dealt with the contradictions of having a lesbian daughter and at the same time being rabidly anti-gay.Don't buy this book - it is a waste of time and money."
5,A Star is Born,Finally we get to hear from Mary Cheney and it was worth the wait! She tells her story in a straightforward and funny way. She is totally comfortable in her own skin. Readers get to experience life on the campaign trail through Mary's eyes. They get to see what it feels like to suddenly become a campaign issue yourself. They get to listen in on warm and loving conversations between Mary and her mom and dad. This book is joy to read. You will end up loving this family and laughing your way to the end of the book.
1,Badly Written,"I wanted to read about how a campaign works from behind the scenes, and I was extremely disappointed with this book. It's not only badly written but it goes on and on and on. It's almost as if she repeats the same lines over and over again. Yeah, there were a few entries about growing up that were nice but it falls short of being worth the read, or the money for that matter. Skip this one and buy something else."
1,Like Father like Daughter?,"Having just read this book, I can say without any reservations -who cares? It doesn't say much other then to get back at Kerry and that's history. Other then that - she doesn't say much - [...]."
2,"Not very well written, no surprises, no meat, fluff","I expected more from this book, but only found the following:1. ""Getting even"" at Kerry/Edwards for opposing her father politically2. Re-iteration of well-worn political talking pointsI was hoping for better writing, insight to the political process, insight to the internal conflicts that must be present in her situation (skipping the state-of-the-union address notwithstanding), or even any sort of behind-the-scenes look at political power today.This book lacks analysis, either of herself, her father, her politics, or politics in general. Sweet little Father's Day Ode, but little more, no matter where you lie on the political spectrum. And at either extreme, something to disgust you."
1,Insipid and boring.,Thank God I work at Borders Books. I read the book for free. I just don't believe a word of it. I think it is all a bunch of crap. Save your money. If you must read it borrow it from the library. [...]
1,Mary Cheney's Book Title reminds me of her sex life,"[...] I thought this book was self indulgent and petty. Factually, news accounts themselves repudiate some of her claims. As for her biting words for John Kerry, her remarks make it clear that she still carries the torch for the campaign days. News flash, the campaign is over. Tired prose, dubious examples, and no attempt to disguise a carny style book hawking expose'--sorry, this just wasn't that interesting a read. I've seen soap operas with more pizzazz and much more class."
2,Don't understand the hype,"Despite all the press coverage, I found the book very dry and humorless. I'm sure this gal had a lot of exciting experiences during the campaigns, but you would never know it from this book. I understand she is close friends with journalist Matthew Drudge and her writing style seems similar. That is one reason I had sought out the book - a decision I regret."
1,"Have you noticed, the stars get lower & LOWER","I saw Larry King, and after that diatribe, I will not read the book.The five-star raters are a bunch of SCHMUCKS"
4,Mary Cheney's Strength,"A good read. Mary is real. Her energetic, insightful support of her Dad's political efforts and her description of that trail is entertaining. Her homosexuality is but a sad, sterile part of the person she is."
4,it works,"The plate works well to install a Cd player in a Pontiac Sunbird, no directions however. You also end up having to screw it into the dash (need a drill) but it comes with the screws. 4 phillips screws end up being your only guard against theft."
1,broke within 2 days,i bought this for 13 year old daughter and after two days she brought it to me the hook on top had broke. I did not save the receipt so I'm unable to file a claim.
1,Noisy USB Adapter,"I bought this headset after reading about it in MacWorld. Unfortunately even after returning it once for a replacement I've noticed that the USB adapter causes a rhythmic beeping feedback noise on both of my Macs. This essentially makes it useless because the noise is distracting and makes it unusable for audio voice recordings.After the second unit exhibited the same problem, I called Altec Lansing for their advice. They claimed that it's ""a problem with Macs"" and advised me to contact Apple. I think it's a bit disingenuous of them to call this ""Mac compatible"" right on the package, when its functionality appears to be greatly diminished.I'm going to try iMic next. But I feel ripped off by this product."
2,Microphone no longer functions after ten months,"Perhaps you don't mind if you get only ten months out of a fairly expensive headset, but though I can hear fine, the microphone no longer works.I only used it for skype so i wasn't using it all the time.Is it worth $40 for ten months? Only in this era of planned obsolescence and the soft bigotry of low expectations is this kind of question even entertained.boo."
1,Poor quality headphones - Rude Customer Service,"I recieved these as a gift for christmas, and since then they have fallen completely apart under normal use. The volume control plastic was not secured and came apart, and one of the earphones fell off as well. When contacting altec lansing I was told I could not even send these headphones in without the original reciept, even though I had gotten them as a gift. Customer service was rude to me as well. These are the worst headphones I have ever had."
3,AHS302USB incompatible with MAC,"I bought 3 headsets on a recommendation from MacWorld. (last time i do THAT!)I had spotty success using these headsets. G4 laptops, one with Tiger, one with Panther, G5 with Tiger. Then finally, the headsets don't work at all. No sound input showing in the system prefs. I spent an hour on the phone with Apple, and they concluded it was due to incompatiblity which cumulatively gets worse and finally the product doesn't work.I emailed Altec Lansing...never got a response.I called Tech support and the disinterested employee passed me on to the corporate office where i left several messages for her to call me back, and am still waiting.I emailed and called again today and told them i am posting these complaints on the internet, so we'll see if they care about that. I'll report back resolution when/if i get any.The headset works like a charm on a PC. Really nice headset. BUT NOT MAC COMPATIBLE. Buyer Beware!"
2,Doesn't fit well,"The reviews of this headset spoke about how well it fit, but I find it to be the contrary. It is way too big for my head and it doesn't adjust (I find that very strange they didn't make it adjustable).The sounds is fairly good on my end - sometimes it is a bit low but I can even hear background noise pretty well. Some people complain they don't hear me well or it cuts out. I don't have any other headset, so I can't compare the quality or sound that well."
3,Altec Lansing USB headset,"This headset has reasonably good sound quality at both the headphones and microphone. The included USB adapter also works for plugging my guitars into my computer.I'm not a big fan of behind the head, and I find this one to be rather uncomfortable."
1,Is not mac compatible,"The item claims to be Mac compatible, and it does work--sort of. Audio output is fine, but the headset adds a very annoying high pitched warble to any audio input, which is completely unacceptable for things like skype. I called Altech's tech support, and I got an extremely anoying person who tried to feed me some garbage that the head set is only compatible with ""analog"" signals but that Macs have both analog and digital, and that all I had to do to fix the problem was to switch my mac to use digital. I asked him how to do that, and he said, contact Apple. Ha! Complete garbage. Buyer beware! On the other hand, I bought this through TigerDirect, and they promptly gave me an RMA, so that's the good news."
5,Uno de los mas memorables,Con este cd el grupo Pandora marco el regreso de Fernanda Meade al grupo de nueva cuenta. Pandora vuelve a ser Pandora. Hermoso volverlas escuchar a las tres originales de nuevo. Excelente
1,SCAM,"This is a junky toy camera. Never buy an ""interpolated"" digital camera, if you want to blow up your pictures at the cost of quality, you can just increase their size on your computer with any software."
1,PDA Stylus,"Shipping was good and that's it. the pen was bent when I got it. I was afraid to put too much tension on it trying to bend it back, so im just dealing with it. it's not like it cost a large chunk of change."
5,This stylus is better than the original,"I especially like the fact that the stylus has an integrated pen. Knowing that I always have my Axim with me, I know that I always have a pen with me. Of course, it is really lightweight and has a great feel during use. Of course, if by chance you need to reset the Axim, this stylus facilitates that also."
1,Daughters of an Emerald Dusk,"This book is really not worth the time it takes to read it. The characters are one dimensional and not developed. The book ""Daughters of a Coral Dawn"" was a love story that had characters of depth. They were so well described that you felt as if you knew them....where as this book is like coming into a play in the middle. The book leaves you wondering what it was that you just read. Maybe Katherine Forrest needs to re-read her first book to remember where she left off and to review her previous format."
5,daughters of an emerald dusk,"as witth all of kathryn forrest books , it excelled in both writing and description ."
1,Barely a star,No easy to read at all. I think you would have to be the author to understand the book......
3,Hard to read!,"The story is really really sad. I had a hard time reading this but the redeeming nature was inspiring. These women are culturally indoctrinated to keep quiet and submit, just as many women still believe. I could relate to how this could happen, it was just tragic and I expended a lot of energy processing it emotionally. Be prepared!"
4,Suspicion and a betrayal of trust by a small town MD,"Gripping and engrossing, this true crime tale of how scores of women were raped by their doctor in the small town of Lovell, Wyoming will stay with you. It's shocking to see the level of hatred by folks proudly calling themselves ""Christian."""
1,A Book Better Left Unread,"As a student of Mormon history and theology, I thought that this book might potentially be an interesting read--certainly, the silence about sex in the Mormon community, as well as the strict patriarchal structure can tend to be problematic in instances...I believed that this book would be about a man who took advantage of the ""Mormon system"" so to speak. Indeed, I was correct on this count, but truly, this book is grotesque, written like a shoddy V.C. Andrews piece...I felt dirty simply for reading it. It truly has no merit...though what happened to these women is certainly horrific, I hardly think that this book handled the situation with the gravity it deserved; rather, Mormon women were fetishized, and molestation and rape were handled in the most gratuitous way. Indeed, the writing itself is almost mastubatory--it is indeed revolting and I was certainly suggest that anyone thinking to read this book would look elsewhere."
3,"Movie Review: ""HUSTLE AND FLOW""","First of all, I couldn't understand a damn word anyone was saying, especially that pimp guy who likes to rap (D Jay I think his name was). I guess my southern California ears couldn't discern any sense from their extremely heavy ghetto Memphis accent. I also did not understand the society in which they lived. I am not familiar with the workings of pimp and ho commerce and infrastructure.Despite these shortcomings, I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie. The thing I found surprising was that it was pretty funny. It was interesting to watch. D Jay's hos, Sug and the blonde one (I forgot her name) were surprisingly endearing and sweet."
4,Dog does not care about Christmas,"Everybody must have a dream, says the small time Memphis pimp and tries to become a rap star. Terence Howard is impressive as DJay. Appropriately, this is an MTV production. One can see it as a music film. One can see it as a gangster film. One can see it as a film about life philosophy. While DJay sits in his old car with Nola, waiting for her next trick, he lectures her on the meaning of life. Man is different from dog. You are a girl, Nola, but in my meaning now you are Man. What do you want from life, Nola? Oh, I don't know. Man is not dog. Dog does not care about Christmas or death. Dog has no dreams.This world is more exotic to me than Conrad's Borneo or Melville's Marquesas.An impressive and strange film."
5,Moviedom,"Hustle and Flow was a movie we were very interested in seeing. It took a while and I had to exchange from HD copy, but we are enjoying the movie over and over again."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I thought this was going to be awful, but it turned out being pretty enjoyable. All the acting is fantastic, especially Terrence Howard. There are definitely plenty of cheesy moments in the recording studio, but those can be overlooked since Isaac Hayes is in the movie wearing a ridiculous purple shirt. And the original guys who did the music from Shaft recorded the score. Sweet."
5,Magnificent!,"Hustle & Flow is a masterpiece of tension. It walks us through a world constantly on the edge of violence and surprises us with gentleness coiled within the pain and fear. After a while, I didn't even hear the cursing because the characters set up a drumbeat in my heart. There are no apologies here for bad choices and bad behavior, but you'll hope the characters triumph over themselves. This is a powerful movie because it dares to show we are all human beings. Every performance was transcendant. The music was inspired. Don't miss Hustle & Flow. It deserved its nominatons and awards and then some."
2,boring,I found the movie to be boring.just couldnot get into it. Expected more from the players. Just not my thing
2,Unintentionally funny,"This movie was funny to me even though I wasn't sure it was suppose to be. Anyway, any movie that makes a pimp into a sympathetic character has got to be kind of funny... only in Hollywood. Watching this scumbag trying to make it in the hip hop world was pretty funny for some reason. But all in all I had no sympathy for him. But in this day and age ""Pimpin' ain't easy."""
4,Hustle & Flow,"Terrence Howard plays DJay, a pimp in Memphis who realizes his dream of becoming a rapper. All he needs is a break. He thinks he's found his break when he meets the very successful Skinny Black, who is also from Memphis. Ludacris plays the role of Skinny Black.Through hard work and his love for rap music, DJay, with the help of Key, played by Anthony Anderson and Shelby, played by DJ Qualls, record a demo they are sure will be a hit.They just need to get the song on the air.Will they succeed? Ludacris seems to be the break they need.Watch the movie and see how things turn out.I enjoyed the energy Terrence Howard brought to this movie. His no-nonsense character was what made the entire movie. Produced by John Singleton, Hustle & Flow delivers a message (believe in your dreams).Anthony Anderson shows his diversity as an actor in his role as Key.Good movie, worth watching."
