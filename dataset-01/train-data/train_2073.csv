2,"okay, for all that","We keep encountering people who refer to ""You're the One""'s ""beautiful melodies"". Well, if rap has influenced this record, it's probably influenced reviewers too. A generation has grown up eating cardboard and calling it bread. In fact, there is scarcely any melody at all on this record, beautiful, plain, or ugly. This is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of knowing what the word ""melody"" means. It doesn't mean any combination of sounds that might happen to appeal to you in any way or by any means (through force of repetition, for example)."
4,"Good, but not his best","I am a longtime Paul Simon fan and have a hard time disliking any of his work. (However, I'm not a big fan of his last CD -- Songs for the Capeman.) I really like several of the songs on this disc, especially ""Old"" and the title track. This disc is well worth the money, but if you're looking for the best of Paul Simon's ""modern"" discs, get 1983's ""Hearts and Bones"" and 1990's ""Rhythm of the Saints""."
3,not quite finished,"Paul's got some good ideas here, but it seems these are more sketches than complete works. He often slips into a talking mode, almost like really singing would be too much effort. It feels like a demo disk with a great rhythm section... Not his best effort by a long shot."
3,"Paul Simon ""You're The One""","Paul Simons' ""You're the One"" is a pretty good album. It is a mild cd. No multiple guitar sounds, no loud drumming, no wild lyrics. This album is very romantic. And the perfect one to listen to on a rainy Sunday winter day, with a glass of red wine and with your loved one. ""That's Where I Belong"" and ""Darling Lorraine"" are perfect openers. I would recommend this cd to the romantic. It is original and nothing like Barry White, Sinatra or Phil Collins. It is a mood on its own."
3,The Poet still has ideas,Paul Simon still has some musical ideas. This album celebrates his stumbling around looking for something new to say and a few of the pieces are enormously interesting where others go backwards in time.
4,Another good one,"This is another strong Paul Simon album. A good come back effort after the disappointing Capeman. Musically its somewhere between Hearts and Bones and Graceland. There is some of the funky African influence of Graceland, but also a bit of a return to his white bread routes so evident in his work with Art Garfunkel. His albums are often hard to evaluate until you have them for awhile, but I don't think this is a good as Graceland or other of his classics. There is a good deal of humor on this album. The humor is fair to midling, working sometimes, and failing at others."
1,Very weak,"This is Simon's least compelling album since Graceland. And Graceland was great because of the African musicians on it more than Simon's songs. Simon's trend toward an intorpsective, conversational style has resulted in songs that seem so contrived and private that it's hard to imagine that they'd be of interest to anybody but Simon himself. Very disappointing."
2,A Long Wait For Very Little,"This effort is a big dissapointment. It does does not approach any of Mr. Simon's better work. The instrumentation is sparce and uninspired. The vocals are forgettable and the songs are not ones you will be humming in a week, forget a month or two!"
1,Amazingly Disappointing,I've listened to it several times and if not for the voice I'd swear this guy was an imposter. Did some record exec. find Simon's throw-aways and decide to publish them?
3,Not the special one,"I guess anything that sounded like a reasonable facsimile of Paul Simon would get raves after the disaster of ""Capeman."" But after repeated listening, nothing here really sticks around. Only two songs are at all memorable -- in that I can recall any of the sounds or words -- and they are ""Darling Lorraine"" and the title track. The rest of ""You're The One"" sounds like a computer programmed to make a ""Paul Simon"" CD, but doesn't quite match up.Novelty songs like ""Old"" and ""Pigs Sheep and Wolves"" are beyond slight. ""Hurricane Eye"" at least has an interesting arrangement, and the album's closer, ""Quiet"" does leave me wondering what Simon's rumored collaborations with Brian Eno will sound like. But ""You're The One"" is just lackluster. I'll not count Paul Simon out of the game; as his recent tour with Art Garfunkle has shown, he is still a great performer, and a great many people had written him off prior to ""Graceland."" Here's hoping the ""Old Friends"" tour gave his muse a jolt."
2,tepid - the decline of lyrics the absence of mirth,"This review is difficult to write as I revere Paul Simon as a true musical genius and one of the greatest artists of this generation. Always inventive, with haunting melodies and thoughtful poetic lyrics; sadly, this gathering of songs is his worst.Mournful, the collection appears to be a resignation (not celebration) of the aging process. Tepid rythmns, a fading guitar. The only way to recognize this as a compliation of Paul Simon is his still true voice.I wanted so much for this album to be inventive and spiced with a little humor and find the rythmns we've grown to expect. Mr Simon's music has always inspired me. But this collection is close to a durge.Like a baseball player continuing past his prime, this is a sad thing to ""watch"", The inspiration is gone. There goes rhymin' Simon...."
2,Simple Simon,"As one of Simon's biggest fans, I was disappointed in his latest work. ""You're the One"" is a collection of sub-Simon songs that carry neither the passion nor the poetic verse that made Simon one of the masters of songwriting. This album would be better named ""Simple Simon"" as there is no depth to the lyrics - no verses that awaken the inner spirit in quiet reflection; nothing that touches the soul. There are no memorable songs from this album, and none that I care to listen to. But Simon has had other forgettable works that were followed by masterpieces. After ""Capeman"" and ""You're the One,"" he's due."
1,don't need to listen again,"With all due respect to those suggesting I listen to this album again and again, I'm doubtful I will come to love songs I so loathed on first listening. I am a HUGE Paul Simon fan, and thus it comes as a big disappointment that his songs on this album are so stale, and his lyrics so predictable and mediocre."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I want to like this CD. I was looking forward to it after his disasterous Capeman, but there just isn't much here. One of the most boring CDs since some of James Taylor's latest efforts. His decline continues... Paul, do you have a good album left inside of you?? After the last few really bad albums he has delivered, I'm afraid the answer may be no... sad..."
2,From Salvador Agron to making us groan,"I'm another of those who has enjoyed Paul Simon's work for a long time, so I was anxious to hear this latest CD. After making myself listen to it several times, all I can say is ""Huh?"". These songs range from OK (That's where I belong, Senorita, Old) to bad (Lorraine, Pigs Sheep & Wolves) to incomprehensible (the Teacher) to unlistenable (Quiet). The only positive thing I can find here is some of the instumental work is nice. But, those lyrics! I'd much rather hear about the Girl from New York City who calls herself a human trampoline than the frog in South America whose venom is an antidote for pain. (Hey, did I just make a rhyme there?) I hope this isn't Paul Simon's last album, as it would be a poor coda to an otherwise great body of work. I give this CD one star because of the music, with the second awarded as a sentimental one because it's by Paul Simon."
1,Booring Paul Simon,"I've been a Simon fan for years--ever since Sounds of Silence --Graceland was the greatest album of all time--But this one? Nothing--Nowhere--none of the songs have ""hooks""--you know, that part of the song that makes you want to sing along with it-I listened to it once--It's on the shelf. Maybe I'll try it again- maybe not."
1,Horrendous!!!,"I was so extremely disappointed with this CD. When my friend gave it to me I was rather excited because I love almost all of pauls earlier work, and have constantly preached that he was much better without Garfunkel. This CD proved me wrong, however, as I was disgusted by track after track. The song ""old"" showed promise at first, but soon became bland and repetitive. The rest of the CD is not worth even talking about, as it can be summed solely with the word awful."
1,Deeply disappointing,"I've been a passionate Paul Simon fan from his early work w/ Garfunkel to the present, but this is set of songs is his weakest work possibly ever. Paul Simon has created so much beautiful music and brilliant lyrics over the years, but this set is just not up to his former standard. It's like he was on cruise control and just put something out, without thinking much about it or trying very hard. With the exception of 'Love', which is wonderful, the songs are weak and uninspired. The lyrics are annoying, preachy, and, especially on 'Pigs, Sheep and Wolves', badly sophomoric. I hope this CD doesn't show that he's lost his musical genius, and that his next CD will be a return to former greatness, but I now have my doubts. I'm getting rid of my copy."
5,Listen to it 10x before you judge,"Paul Simon amazed me again with an album that should be placed on a pedestal that reaches the heavens. In this album, Simon is more obviously the driving force behind the music, but it also keeps much of the African and South American tones of Graceland and Rhythm of the Saints. Thankfully, Victor Nguini is present on the album--he is guitar's posterboy of understated guitar work genius. Like Radiohead, Simon's last few albums are not catchy, but grow on you more and more everytime you listen to them. Even if you hate the music of this album, you should buy it just for the lyrics. Peaceful as a Hurricane Eye is one of the most amazing songs, lyrically, I've ever heard."
2,"Sorry, not prime Simon","You're The One is not growing on me with repeated listenings- and I'm really trying to find the jewels. Frankly, Mr. Simon sounds somewhat dysphoric. Folks, Capeman is truly THE under-rated Paul Simon album. I would have loved to have had the opportunity to see the show (I've been listening to Reuben Blades and Marc Antony for years). If you feel the need to pick up a recent Simon album, get Capeman."
3,Not Up To Par,"I love Paul Simon but do yourself a favor listen to a friends copy but don't buy it without listening. Unfortunately, there really isn't a strong cut on the album. I bought it listented to it 3-4 times, really wanted to like it, but its relatively weak stuff, Pauls vocal delivery doesn't do much either. I'm still a fan but disappointed, hopefully he will regain his creative juices on his next project. But I guess it begs the question, will he become an oldies act or is there anywhere else to go..."
1,Time For The Dog Track?,"I even enjoyed much of the Capeman CD, so I have a high tolerance for Paul Simon's quirkiness. Having been a fan for as long as I can remember, I've come to expect certain things from Simon: craftsmanship, evocative lyrics, and experimentation. This CD sounds as though he thought up some ""profound"" non sequiturs, plugged in the drum machine, looped some acoustic guitars, and cashed the check. Maybe Simon realized that he didn't have the vocal chops any more (no crime at 50-something) to carry off his trademark well-crafted three-minute pop songs, so he simply decided to go through the motions and retire. I hope I'm wrong, but sadly, something tells me I'm right."
4,Solid Simon,"Simon has written a very good album here. The songs are solid lyrically and musically. ""Darling Lorraine"" is one of the best melodies he's ever written and the lyrics will have a profound effect on you. What's beautiful about this album is the way the songs complement each other. Very well done. If you're a Paul Simon fan check this out."
5,Paul simons best work in years!!,I dont undertsand why everyone seems to have a problem with this new record.Its a wonderful record exactly what i expected out of paul simonI expected something diffrent and new and thats exactly what he deliverd its the perfect mix between his older work and the graceland era.Awsome album I was not diapointed at all and ive been a paul simon fan since the simon and grfunkel days
1,Boring,"This was quite possibly the most boring CD I have ever purchased. I am a Paul Simon fan, but I could barely get through this. I threw it away."
1,"Too little, too late","These songs are only great if you were born after 1980. Paul Simon wrote his best songs before 1970. Everyone knows it. Buy Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme instead. PLEASE!!! Paul Simon's long-term reputation depends on it."
2,"A Sad Follow-Up To ""Graceland""","I've listened to Paul Simon's music for decades, but this CD just isn't the Paul we've all learned to love. After the upbeat, unique style of ""Graceland,"" I was expecting another fresh, new approach -- Paul's latest bright idea. Instead, I got a CD full of sadly (not badly) sung music, with an overriding theme of feeling one's age in a negative way and an odd ""I got religion"" undertone. Yes, we're all experiencing the aging process, but not all of us what to hear it moaned at us by one of our favorites. Sorry Paul, we love you, but you should have kept your mid-life crisis and religious beliefs out of the recording studio."
1,"Verses out of rhythm, couplets out of rhyme","What happened to the great Paul Simon? The guy that made all of that timeless music in the '60s with Art Garfunkel? The guy that made one of my all-time favorite albums ""There Goes Rhymin' Simon""? The guy that created ""Graceland""?Simon has written more than his share of great tunes, and has turned out plenty of good albums. This is definitely NOT one of them.He sings flat and out of tune, the songs have little to no melodies to speak of, the lyrics are just a bunch of pseudo-intellectual but ultimately nonsensical ramblings for the most part, and Simon just sounds like he's had it.This is weak, weak, weak. Considering other fairly recent failures such as ""The Capeman,"" and the fact that both his voice and his imagination appear to be shot, it might be time to call it a career."
2,not a masterpiece,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the former review in giving this album a poor rating. Basically this is embarrassing to listen to and I think I can rate myself among the fans of Paul Simon. I hate to say this but every time an artist ""listens"" to the critics of a particular album and decides to give them what they want, the result is disaster. An artist shouldn't listen to anybody and just record what he or she thinks is best. I'm oneof those who thought the capeman was pretty good. Compared to this it was a masterpiece."
2,Disappointment,"I am a big Paul Simon fan and consider him one of our great songwriters. But I was extremely disappointed with this album. The album sounds great musically. The rhythms are a feast and the production and instrumentation are great. The lyrics are thoughtful and interesting although sometimes a little cerebral or silly. The songs,however,lack catchy melodies. I don't think there is a single song on the album that has a memorable hook. One of Simon's strongpoints has always been that his songs had strong hooks. Graceland, Hearts and Bones, Rhythm of the Saints are some recent Simon albums that are brimming over with songs with great melodies."
2,Can't run any more,"His last album (if you ignore Capeman, which most would consider kind), Rhythm of the Saints, began with the line 'Can't run but I can walk much faster than this...' and many thought it summed up an album of gentle, pleasant underachievement. Paul Simon's pace now seems to have slowed to a crawl - this album is like Hearts and Bones with a tinkling of African guitars and cheap-shot lazy lyrics (reminiscent of Loudon Wainwright III) - but without the standouts like Train in the Distance and Rene and Georgette Magritte that made Hearts and Bones a truly wonderful, if flawed, work of art. Well, people get older, they get a little set in their ways, a little boring, and they start thinking that Uillean pipes are a good idea (cf Van Morrison). Not one song in particular is really worth mentioning. I just hope he plays some of the old tracks on his UK tour!"
5,Worth the wait !!!,"I have to ask. Is it possible for this guy to write a bad song? I have never been disappointed by any of Paul Simon's work and that still holds true. This album earns its place on my shelf alongside Graceland, Hearts and Bones, Still Crazy and all the other classics. I just wish I didn't have to wait so long between releases. Keep `em coming Paul."
4,Excellent,"Paul's new album is a mellow and quiet album. It has many of the same textures of Capeman and Rhythm of the Saints. If you're a fan of his other work, you'll love this new album."
2,yikes,"I'm sure there are quite a few people here who can't tell that Paul Simon is singing flat on this record (not consistently, but often enough). I don't expect everyone to be able to--just the ones setting themselves up as musical authorities by submitting reviews.And while I'm at it: ""begging the question"" DOES NOT mean ""asking or eliciting a question"". It means proving by assuming the thing you want to prove is true. It is a particular kind of error in reasoning logicians call petitio principii, a material fallacy of presumption. Review ""You're the One"" favorably or unfavorably, but please stop abusing this phrase."
1,"""With the part of me that hurls"" - I give it 1 star","I'm a Paul Simon fan and I couldn't believe how bad this CD was. The lyrics range from the banal to obscure. One of Simon's faults at a lyricist is occasionally letting his delight in wordplay get away from him. In other words, he can become too clever for this own good. This CD has that in spades. Consider the following ""gem"" from Darling Lorraine:So I walked upright up to herand with the part of me that talksI introduced myself as Frank.""With the part of me that talks""? Yeah, whatever you say Paul. Musically, it's pretty drear and uninteresting. If this was done by any other artist it would be tossed aside quickly. Forget this CD and put on ""Still Crazy ..."""
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Listening to this album is painful. Having been a fan of his music, this album is extremely disappointing. Now I'm just trying to figure out how to get rid of it!"
1,Paul's Pap,"It's obvious from Paul Simon's work on The Capeman to this tossed-off, half-finished piece of hackwork that he has an utter contempt for his fans and American music fans in general. There isn't a single memorable melody here, the lyrics aren't clever in the least, the production is laughable, and the entire project has a ""let's just get it over with"" feel that's the most amateurish sound I have EVER heard released by a major record company. Paul Simon now joins Chuck Berry as major artists who are just sailing along, picking up dimes along the road, not caring whether the performance is good or bad...and that really hurts. Here's where Simon joins folks like Peter Paul and Mary as artists who once seemed important, but who, after their true skins were exposed, weren't really major stars at all."
2,Great for the kids - at bedtime!,"I play this one for my son at bedtime a lot. Listening to it puts him right to sleep! I've listened to it a bunch of times now, and it doesn't grow on me. It is a dull work. I hope Paul can come through again with great music, but this is not the disc."
1,Paul Simon is getting old,"This album is terrible. It is about being old or about aging. Perhaps that is what he himself is going through, but as a younger listener this is not interesting, and I doubt it is to most of his older listeners.After 2 great albums in a row (Graceland, Rhythm of the Saints) Simon has gone downhill, and that is to put it nicely. You're the One, and Capeman are terrible, and it seems like Paul Simon may finally have run out of good songs.There is one song on here that is actually catchy, and I kind of like it. Oddly, Old is the song. It kind of fun, and takes a more light hearted look at aging than a lot of the stuff here.Avoid this, it is not worth your time or money."
2,I can't believe I'm disappointed,"I've been a fan (a true fanatic) of Simon's work since the mid-sixties, to the point where I don't even pretend to be objective about him. I even loved One Trick Pony and The Capeman. But I just could not get into this CD at all. And it's not like I have to have All Graceland, All The Time -- my two favorite Simon albums are ""Paul Simon"" and ""Hearts and Bones."" I figured I'd eat this thing up. But I find the lyrics shockingly banal and the music really forgettable. And yes, I have listened to it numerous times. If I'm going to give anyone the benefit of the doubt, it's Simon. But there's no doubt anymore -- I just moved to a place with its own storage locker, and ""You're the One"" went in there along with all the other CDs I know I won't be playing anytime soon. (If and when Springsteen ever disappoints me this way, I'm going to be one depressed music fan.)"
3,Capable of better,"This album seems to be another showcase for instrumentalism and lyricism more than anything else. Like 'Rhythm Of The Saints', it is sometimes hard to remember which songs are which because they all seem to blend in to the overall sound of the album, which is not necessarily a bad thing...The album is over produced once again, but I am biased as I prefer the raw quality of 'Paul Simon' of 1972, for example.The first thing that struck me was his return to delivering a sort of talky narrative throughout some songs which only vaguely resembles singing, which has become a bit of an irritating habit.However, Simon's career is a progression and any attempt to return to the past would probably fall flat..it's good to hear that he is still capable of producing original, if somewhat dull, music..."
4,A great album from one of the best -,"I found Simon's latest offering a tremendously entertaining and moving collection of songs. While I'm hardly an expert on his entire body of work, and don't presume to hold this up to what is regarded as his best, I find even his most pedestrian efforts to be the work of a master songwriter/singer, and this album is far from pedestrian. ""You're The One"" seems to find Simon in an enormously introspective time in his life, and he deftly addresses life, love and mortality with equal amounts of wit, whimsy and poignancy. I'm lucky if a CD gets more than two or three listenings in my house. This one has been on heavy rotation for a few days now, and that passes my criteria for a real gem."
5,Another Simon Masterpiece,"What more can be said? This is another example of Paul Simon's brilliance as a writer and performer. He again has assembled one of the best rhythm sections I've ever heard. The subtle humor is great! This is not an album you put in your CD deck unless you're ready to listen carefully. When you're listening intently, the genious of this album will shine through. DO NOT put it on for background music! You'll never get it."
2,Whatever Happened to Rhymin' Simon?,"Another weak effort by Paul Simon. I was excited when this talented composer/performer released ""Capeman"", especially since it had been so many years since ""Saints"", only to find that the tunes uninspiring and dull. Unfortunately, this new CD isn't much better. Gone are the rich melodies that Simon is famous for, replaced by a sort of odd, chatty, ""white mans rap"" that I found boring and lifeless. I'm just glad that I didn't purchase a ticket to his upcoming concert."
4,still worthwhile after all these years,"It amazes me that anyone would give this album a 1 star rating. Such a rating suggests ineptitude and shoddiness on the part of the artist, and that's hardly the case with Paul Simon on 'You're The One.' I do feel this album is a *somewhat* lesser work (my actual rating would be 3.5 stars). The hooks are more subtle, and the lyrics are less poetic. But, it's still a fine album. I wasn't expecting an album to equal 'Graceland' or 'Rhythm Of The Saints'(or any other Paul Simon classic). I just knew the album was coming, and I was sure I'd like it, because Paul Simon is an artist who is too smart and too classy to ever release anything substandard."
3,soft claws for the patient minded,"My cat has been on soft claws for about 1.5 yrs now. My roommate had just bought a new leather couch, and just having my cat walk on it created scratches. Soft claws works like a charm, if your cat will stay still. Mine doesn't mind me putting the first few, then she gets impatient with my lack of skill and starts getting pretty fussy.This doesn't last 3-4 months like the package says! It only stays on her claws as long as she'll let them - max 4 weeks. I usually have to apply them every couple of weeks, but only for a handful of claws."
4,Great option,"I was very leery of how my 4 year old cat Leo would react to the application of soft paws. I would say that the difficult part was the clipping of the nails. After that, the application was easy. I filled 5 covers with glue, and had them on stand by. Then slipped them all on. The only issue we ran into, was getting all of his long toe hairs out of the way to slide them on. But after 24 hours, all covers are still on, and he seems as though he could care less. So, as of right now, ill give three cheers for Soft Paws. Now, i'm off to patch the couch :)"
1,"Useless at best, Painful at worst...","The worst case scenario: My cat has a ""soft"" claw covering embedded into his paw pad. I have to take him to a vet in order to get it removed before it becomes infected. For my other cat, his actual claws shatter and the ""soft paws"" end up dangling off of his nails.The best case scenario: Your cat sounds like he's wearing high heels. The paws last at most 6 weeks, some fall off much faster."
2,Great idea.... just doesn't quite work,"I bought this product out of desperation to avoid getting my 4 year old cat declawed, after moving in with a significant other. After reading the other reviews I thought that it was worth a try. Unfortunately, this product didn't work for my cat. The first few hours, maybe even the first day, the product worked suprisingly well. After that I was finding claw cups all over the house. He would hide out somewhere and chew until he could get one off.... and no amount of glue will oustand the persistence of a mad cat. What really turned me off of this product is when I found a claw cup on the floor with an entie nail. The product had become irritating enough for my cat to perfer ripping his entire nail out of his paw, claw cup included. If you are in a desperate situation then give it a try. Don't expect a miracle."
5,Not usually a Monster cable fan but these are great!,These made my install go so much easier. If I had to run a 4ch and a 2ch or 3 sets of 2ch I wouldn't have had the room. Cost was not any more than any other decent RCA since I only had to buy the one. I've got no noise even though I had to run it part of the way with the power wire and speaker wire.
5,Good Sound,I really like these RCAs but Ive already had to replace one set due to a terminal coming loose. Monster covers their products and is the best of the best
2,Think about this first....,"I am giving this a two out of five because of the difficulty when trying to disconnect them from an audio source. I replaced my car stereo and I almost broke the rca's on the back of the radio and did break one on the amp in my trunk. I got them off but one of the jacks broke, still usable though. Otherwise its okay product and be warned the cable is really thick.."
2,6 channel monster rca cable,"The company is great, fast shipping and low prices I have no issues with the seller. The product however is kind of useless. The RCA cables have such a small amount of space to work with on the connecting ends it's very difficult to install to a 2 amp setup. If you only have one amp with 6 channels it would work great."
5,Super introduction to the opera,"We used this video as an introductory device for the story of The Magic Flute in elementary school. We used this for 3rd grade, though it would be fine for 4th and 5th also. This did not really give a total opera experience to the children, but was terrific as a forerunner to the real thing. We followed this with the Met version of the opera, though we did not show one scene from that because we thought it was a bit inappropriate."
5,Graphic,"A timely, graphic but limited account of the January 2010 earthquake in Port au Prince. Not deeply informative but the images and footage were moving, if not disturbing. The best documentary of the earthquake I have come across. Worth the purchase, in my opinion."
5,Fabulous FarScape Fiction,"Ohhhh man, this book was great! Farscape, the most wonderful and excellent sci-fi television series now has a most excellent and wonderful book series! Take THAT, Babylon 5! (Apologies to all B-5 fans). This book had all the humor, witty remarks, cool creatures and fabulous Crichton one-liners inherent in the tv series itself. I never get tired of Johnny-Boy saving the day. The ""Drunken Aeryn"" scene was one of my favorites. This was the fastest I have ever plowed through a book. 5 hours. 199 pages was the perfect length too. Just about as long as an episode would be if you had to read it. I can definitely say that we can all be safe in the knowledge that greatness has returned to televison series-based novels. Of course, this is the first series-based novel I've read since Quantum Leap. Well worth the purchase price. Just like the tv series I am certain that these new book additions will never let me down. Viva Liantac, everyone! Viva Liantac indeed."
2,Poor,"I love Farscape. The acting, the sets, the story, everything about it. This book, however, is not very good.It's very awkward, the characters aren't like them selves. They say odd things and the whole book is kinda silly. The story is poor and feels like a VERY bad suspense movie. This book is only for people who are obsessed with Farscape(like me) and will read it once and then keep it on your shelf. I recommend reading it, but it's not worth reading over one time."
4,Viva Liantac!,"...This slim novel reads just like an episode (an episode *with Zhaan,* BTW), which works fine for me. For those playing the home game, it's set between ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and ""The Locket"" and is packed with continuity and references to the show - with the added benefit of being privy to everyone's thoughts. Heck, there's even a nice, obscure little Trek reference in it...P>Rygel loses Moya in a card game on a gambling planet, and Crichton, Zhaan, and D'Argo are forced to work off the debt in order to get Moya back. Crichton sings Elvis and Aeryn gets blotto. Mmmm...I daresay there's more going on than meets the eye. Swell little romp in the Uncharted Territories."
5,Farscape - the Missing Episode,A very enjoyable story which reads much like a missing episode of the series. The author has an excellent grasp of the characters and type of stories that makes Farscape such a good television show.
5,Great Book.,"This book Is wonderful. Keith has really caught the feel of the show, with this one. I could almost hear Ben's voice singing Viva Los Vagas ::SMILES:: Great book well done."
2,Works...,"I thought I was purchasing an OEM charger, since that is what the picture is. It was aftermarket though. No big deal, just disappointed."
2,Travel Charger,"For the price item is OK, for my phone charger has to be wiggled to work in charge mode. Phone sometimes goes to sync mode or video out mode."
2,Cheap Charger,This charger does the job for my T-Mobile Dash but the charge does not last long. I have had the charger just a little over a month and a piece has already broken off that holds the little piece that connects to my phone.
4,Fast Delivery,The wall charger for my MDA was delivered very quickly. It took less than a week to receive it. Good buy.
3,It works for my HTC Touch,"For a cheap charger, I was quite apprehensive if it would work. It did, I have kept this one at my office and charge it regularly. No complaints so far. However, I cannot comment on how much time does it take to charge my cellphone as compared to the original one, because I have never noted it."
4,Old & In the Gray,"If you likes The Grateful Dead and if you like bluegrass, then this is something you have to have"
4,Great CD to round out your collection!,"Without Jerry and Vasser, it is hard to accept this title. But Peter Rowan's sweet voice, and the rock-solid musicians that ""picked"" up the slack (pun intended) made up for it. Bryn Bright on bass is spot on as usual, and song choices like ""Pancho & Lefty"" make this one a jewel in my collection."
4,Nice but slight design flaw,"This machine was a breeze to put together despite the poor instructions and it is a very solid machine. My main issues with it are that the arm pad isn't at enough of an angle and the seat doesn't go low enough to get to where the pad is up into your arm pits. Most people at any gym do preacher seat curls wrong. They lean way over the pad and involve their shoulders in the exercise. The pad should be up into your arm pits and you should be leaning back, completely removing your shoulders from the movement. Overall though the machine has quality, smooth movement and seems to be solid. For the Amazon price it's a great deal since similar quality machines sell for almost twice."
1,Mehdi Zana is the Kurdish problem,Wealthy landlords like MZ are the source of the problem and the suffering of the Kurdish people.
4,Very helpful book,"I am very excited about this book. It addresses areas that I need to talk to my students about: making mistakes, friendships, time alone vs time with others, living with Autism just to name a few. The chapters are short and to the point. I can see using this with my High School students. Now if I could just find the time to review it and incorporate it into my lessons!"
4,X-Men: The Last Stand soundtrack,"Overall, I thought this was the most hauntingly beautiful score to date for the X-Men Films. The only negative thing I have to say about it, is that one of the main reasons that I purchased the score, was to get the music that is heard in the trailers, and on the website for the film. This music is not on the soundtrack anywhere. I do not know what happened to that little bit of score, but I wanted it, it was very powerful, and very moving (at least to me). So, if you are looking for that music, be forewarned, it is NOT on the soundtrack. Other than that, I think it is a wonderful soundtrack. The funeral music almost brings me to tears when I listen to it, it is so lovely. Powell's use of the choir is wonderful as well."
5,Amazing score.,"The themes are magnificent and the action cues, though a little repetitive, are awesome. Best score in the series, hands down."
3,Tired and generic score,"Man, what a slide into typical-ville John Powell has taken right after his fantastic ""United 93"" score. There is nothing exciting or new or fresh about this score. I mean even the ""Batman Begins"" score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer has some variation to it. I must be in the minority because this was just terrible apart from the film. Makes me wanna crawl into the fecal and fetal position and suck my thumb."
1,Waste of $$$,"You think for 99 cents that it is a good buy. WRONG! Told me I was ovulating, but then my period started like an hour later. Rip off."
5,It's got a Shatner quote...,"...on the back cover.What can I say, it's the 4th Over the Hedge book, and if you liked the first 3 (and the strip IS different then the movie), then you'll like Stuffed Animals. I read it everyday via comics.com (since the Indy Star doesn't actually have ""funny"" comics anymore) and I look forward to hearing what Verne & RJ are up to."
2,Not what I expected,"Having watched the movie ""Over The Hedge"" I expected the characters to be just as funny, animated and entertaining. I found the books disappointing, slow and sometimes crass and NOT funny. I believe the screenwriters did a fantastic job in shaping this animated film, a rare case in which the movie is better than the book."
3,Warm and sincere but definitely a memoir,"I will admit at the outset that I was assigned this book as part of a class. While Ms. Fisher's stories are interesting and give a rare first-hand look at the agonizingly byzantine and passionate process of desegregation, the book is not entirely edited and the writing is often hard to follow. In addition, many incidents which do not add to the storyline or the study of civil rights are included which detract from the larger narrative arc."
4,Passionate Wit,"I enjoyed this book. I had never heard of Betty Kilby Fisher prior to reading the book, but I agree that her story had to be told, preserved in book form and made available to the world.The bookcover photo says more than words could ever say. I highly recommend this book not only to adults, but to young adults (High School Age) also. The author selected a title that was very fitting."
2,no help,"After finishing reading this book, I learned nothing from it. I still don't know how to estimate my project. sign!"
5,Fabulous and enchanting!,Fires At Midnight really struck me with an inspiring sensation. I love this CD and all the others that Blackmore's Night has graced this world with. A wonderful masterpiece for any lover of Blackmore's Night.
4,Good effort - no surprises.,"I could hardly wait to get this CD in my hands, having played the other 2 Blackmore's Night CDs I have over and over. While this is a worthy effort, nothing seemed to jump out at me as memorable, surprising, or intriguing.There are a few places where Blackmore's instrumental riffs caught my attention, echoes of Deep Purple from my youth, yes indeed, but again, nothing that I couldn't get out of my head.I like the CD, am glad I bought it, will play it many times, I'd just hoped, as Oliver Twist did, for 'more'."
5,I need more stars than five! Ten probably...,"Great music. I love it! Ritchie plays wonderful, Candice Night, his wife, uses her beautiful voice perfectly. Her voice matches specially well with Ritchie's medieval music... Yes. He plays now less Hard Rock and more the mix of folk-medieval-rock! Deep Purple, Rainbow and Blackmore's Night, those names are 'Made by Ritchie', and all of them give us music pure! But Blackmore's Night is special, very special. Listen to it and allow you to get carried away by the sound of this CD!"
2,not my cup of tea,"well I have to admit that if a band always sounds the same then it would be a very dull world. The reason I start with that is because the reason I fell in love with this group was for the medieval/olden times sound that they often create. This CD has a few songs on it that capture that old time Medieval/Minstrel sound and it is delightful. Although the rest of the album's offerings are good, there is a lot of electric guitar and a certain ""pop"" music sound as well. It just didn't have as many songs that made you feel you were at a Ren fair. Oh well. They are still a great band, this just won't be one of their CD's I listen to very much."
3,Come gather round people wherever you roam.....,"""Village in the Sand"" is a classic. A powerful mix of some good ol' riff-rock and ren. Not far behind are ""Home Again"" and ""Written in the Stars"".As good as the aforementioned tracks are, ""All Because of You"" is pure cr*p. Mindless fluff. Should read ""I-Have-a-Career-All-Because-of-You"". Leave it home next time. Stick to cuts like the title track and ""Mid-Winters Night"".And also lay off the Dylan classics. You're treading on sacred ground here....."
4,Zane is muscular and melodic,"Zane Massey has two very good acoustic jazz albums out, Brass Knuckles from 1993 and Safe to Imagine from 1996. If you like Joshua Redman, Roy Hargrove, and acoustic jazz, then check out Zane."
2,Poorly written and supported,"Although I agree with many of the views of this author, I found this book frustrating to read. It was written like one of those overbearing e-mails you get with lots of capitalized and bolded text. Though studies were referenced, sources were often not clearly or properly cited. The flow was also confusing and the book lacked specific recommendations (e.g. although there is a whole section on protein and the importance of consuming enough, there are no recommendations on what amounts of protein are appropriate). With some competent editing support, I think this book could have been much more compelling and effective. Essentially, I support the intent of the book, but I didn't find it to be effective."
4,Getting Back To The Basics of Human Health,"Lots of information to get healthy if need be and to stay healthy for a long time. Some of the ingormation I do not agree with, but it was valuable in knowing."
1,Pseudoscience,"You can tell from reading this book that Mary Frost has no scientific background and no understanding of biochemistry or nutritional science. The science in this book is at the same level as whomever is spreading the urban myth of canola oil causing cows, sheep, and pigs to go blind and then attack people. Avoid being sucked in by this fake science. Mind you, finding good general nutrition books is difficult and I sympathize with those that are looking for straight facts on nutrition. A good place to start may be Walter Willett's ""Eat, Drink and Be Healthy."""
4,Delerium-ish Gabriel & Dresden Elephant Memory Vocal,This is a pretty good cd single featuring the 'Gabriel & Dresden Elephant Vocal Remix! The other mixes really don't interest me .. much. If you liked Delerium's 'Innocente' (the dj tiesto remix) then I'm your sure you'd like this. Sweet female vocals = Good trance.
4,"A mediocre, no frills release from Tiesto.","Honestly you're better off spending your hard-earned money somehow else. DJ Tiesto is certainly a talented artist, but ""In My Memory"" is definately not one of his best pieces. The extra track - ""Urban Train"" is most likely the main selling point of this CD. That's why you'd want to buy this.So, I would suggest finding a different CD with ""Urban Train"" by Tiesto on it. There are plenty of mixes that include this great track. Off you go."
1,Melts in the sun,"As soon as you put weight (like a wet beach towel) on this and the sun hits it and it gets hot, it will bend and lose its shape. It practically melts in the sun."
5,One of the best guitar ever,Since the first time I heard Jeff Golub I could not stopped listening. He is one of the greatest at his style. His last two albums are wonderful. He gets better all the time.
2,Tame Vampire Flicks,"Whilst browsing a local store looking for horror I haven't seen before, i came across this 4 DVD set for a mere couple bucks (including tax). While worth the purchase price, there's nothing really to find here other than PG-13 rated vampire flicks with nothing really offensive content in any of them. I wouldn't recommend it other than to feed your appetitite for horror afficienados."
3,Are there stainless steel Forkchops?,"A cool idea. Does anyone know if these come in various metals such as Stainless, Silver, Gold, etc?. All I can locate are plastic. :("

2,Not Exactly Edith Hamilton,"This is certainly an exhaustive, scholarly text, and it would be a very valuable resource for graduate students and professors. For someone with a more casual interest in Greek mythology, however, it's just about unreadable. Try Hamilton, Bulfinch, or Morford, instead."
2,Not as complete as you might expect,"I study mythology and legends in Ancient Greece and so I got this book in the hopes it could lead me in new directions. The fact is, that I easily have more sources on the legends I work with than this book does. As a result I am deeply disappointed in this book and its claims to be a great resource. My advice is to check with the nearest university library near you and the read some of the principle source books in the field you are interested in; they'll have more references and moreinformation than this collection but you may need to read French or German to benefit from them. Can't read French or German? Then this book may be your best starting point to begin your own investigations into classical mythology."
5,Great Christmas Gift,"I ordered this box set for my 2yr old's 2nd Christmas. Now all she says is Elmo! She evens sings the theme song!! Its super cute to see her take a liking to something, it is really getting her to talk and interact more!!"
2,Boring to my LO's,"We had the Elmo with animals that a friend gave to us, it was such a hit and engrossing that I just knew this box set would be a hit for our LO's, but they get very bored quickly with this set. I'm not sure why this one isn't as good as the other, but it just doesn't do it for our kiddos."
5,Love it!,"two years old daughter loved this set. My son 4 1/2 who usually doesn't watch Elmo loves to sit and watch it too. I like this set. Other than this set we have ""flower,banannas, and more"" dvd of Elmo's World. Kids like these dvds a lot."
1,I was very upset by the seller of this product,I bought this dvd set for my 2 1/2 year old daughter who is obssed with elmo and when I got the 3 dvd box set I only revieved 2 of the 3 dvds. I would be very careful buying any products from 3x5 flag seller. She lied on her description of her product she was selling and then would not give me back my money. I just hope someone else does not have the same problems out of this seller as I did.
4,My boy loves elmo,All around good educational entertainment for our son. We have both box sets and some other Sesame Street videos and he loves them all
4,Empathy,"This is short sweet picture book with the beautiful blues and greens of the sea in its charming illustrations. It tells the tale of a boy who makes friends with a young selkie, ( a shape-shifter who can transform from a seal to a girl by taking her sealskin off.) Their friendship helps him appreciate her uniqueness and also the subtle and mysterious ""language of the sea."" Unlike the greedy oysterman who captures the selkie and imprisons her so that he can force the language of the sea from her to make himself rich, the boy appreciates her and befriends her and in the end receives a gift freely given and so, all the more precious. I gave this book 4 stars because I really like it but it is not a masterpiece. Never the less, it is a good story contrasting greed with kindness and is deserving of its 4 stars in more ways than one."
3,not a slip-on sleeve,"This brace is the best I've tried so far, and I've tried several! Very supportive, and the extra velcro support shown in the photo is adjustable on the bottom as well as the top.This is NOT, however, a slip-on sleeve. It wraps around and secures with velcro in the back. That makes it more bulky than I had expected. Otherwise I would have rated this a perfect 5."
2,Windows 2000 Mac Support,"Bummer, this book is a ""wannabe"".Although, the Windows NT information is without a doubt, far and above superior to Microsoft's documentation it falls short with Windows 2000 support. Unfortunately, this book dwells upon AppleTalk as a viable protocol. However, Macintosh systems have supported TCP/IP as the native protocol since 7.x. AppleTalk is for all practical purposes dead -- Modern Giga Bit routers do not route AppleTalk. There is no discussion of Macintosh access via TCP/IP except implicitly through DAVE.Microsoft might as well have written the discussion of the UAM (Universal Access Module) it is so terse. This book will be a great asset for those unfortunate folks supporting Legacy systems whose budgets will not allow forward progress."
5,Tiny by size and massive by value,"A delightful book to tuck into your purse or briefcase, easy, fun and interesting to read, filled with ponderable thougths and do-able actions to help you be more successful. ""What kind of success"", you ask. That's the beauty of it, you can apply it to any success you want. . .in any area of life. . .at any age.It is packed with the author's personal stories and experiences of her clients (real people) who used her strategies and questions Escude is practically giving away in this tiny book (by size) and massive (by value). A great gift too."
5,Small but effective collection of MLK's speeches,"When looking for some words of tribute to use at a church function, I recalled the copy of the book sitting amongst others in my home library. No better orator could have been selected than the revered civil rights leader. My presentation went off without and hitch and for that, I thank Dr. King.This collection is divided into ten sections, with notable commentary by Dr. King:1. The Community of Man2. Racism3. Civil Rights4. Justice and Freedom5. Faith and Religion6. Nonviolence7. Peace8. ""I've Been to the Mountain Top"" (excerpt)9. ""I Have a Dream"" (excerpt)10. Proclamation of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day by then-President Ronald ReaganThe book begins with a foreward by King's widow, Coretta, and ends with a chronology and sources of the works printed."
2,good,"I was impressed by the speeches I was able to appreciate and compare in this book. I do not have it now, since I look to Barack Obama for leadership and good speeches. -Dave Chiddix"
5,Call For Action,"A remarkable man that gave his life fighting for equality for African Americans in the U.S., Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. His wife, Coretta Scott King, wrote the introduction and selected nearly 120 quotes that chronicle his fight for freedom. There are excerpts from his ""I Have A Dream"" speech that always brings tears to my eyes. Then the other quotes will make you think about how far have we really come. After reading you will thank God for such a compilation of words. I'm encouraged and ready to volunteer for freedom."
3,Shut up and dance,"The vocabulary of dance is the infinite possibilities of the body in space and time and (usually) with music. It is not words. All I remember from the video was talkin', talkin', talkin', gabbin', chatin', BSin', jokin'. They are a nice enough couple (a tad bland - she needs a more exciting partner) but they talk too much.Rather than explain a simple step 10 times in intricate detail - just show me - first slow several times, then faster, then with flair, and finally with variety, style, and flourish.Leave the words to Amazon reviewers. Don't talk to me - dance for me, show me. Explain a little, then dance a lot."
2,not for me!!,def not what I was expecting and hoping for. I did not like how it was lay'ed out and I returned it!! go to borders and look at it before buying it on here!!
3,Pat Travers rhythm guitarist,"I bought this DVD remembering seeing this band live and rocking out many many years ago. I guess I must of missed something when I was younger and saw Pat Travers. Maybe I was just to buzzed to notice back then. But he really only plays lead guitar on a few songs and a few places here and there. The music is okay, and you can hear his voice suffering. As far as anyone calling this guy a guitar god, I got news for you, not even close. You want guitar god lead guitar buy the soon to be released Frank Marino DVD, any Gary Moore, or Robin Trower, but this guy not so much. Kind of like watching Joan Jett except she's hot and female."
4,rock on...,Yeah his voice is a bit shot on the high notes but the band is tight and rocks hard..his sideman (Riggs) gets plenty of showcasing though i could do without the pirate shirt and 80's glam hair...but he does play/sing his butt off.All around good rock concert as long as you know most of the songs before you seeit...enjoy the ride...
2,Don't Waste your time or money,"I have seen Pat TRavers at least 10 times in my life, and this has to be his worst performance. He cannot sing any high notes anymore, and he looks like a middle age women who is bloating.There is a previous video out that is excellent. He is a lot younger in it, and the songs are full of energy. This one bites."
5,Wonderful,"I think this product is wonderful! I have a very docile cat who lets me do anything to him but if your cat won't let you put them on it can be difficult. Discuss applications with your vet. My vet is willing to put them on for me if needed. You can get a sack to zip your cat up in that allows you to unzip one paw a time to apply the claw covers. They are super glued on and Ramses has only managed to remove one (my fault, I didn't get that one on right before the glue dried, the only one I messed up) the first few days. I would recommend this product to anyone with cats."
2,cat nails review,"I don't recommend this product to cat owners. It's hard to get your cat to sit still for you to put them on, especially if you have a hand disability like i do. The cat can take them off in a day or two if you're lucky they'll stay on that long. I just didn't like the product, but to each his own."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is a piano solo album by Michel Petrucciani; I find it's an excellent album, very soft, rich of fascinating melodies and songs, played by the great M.P., here at his peak level; I love every song of this album."
3,Oh so dissapointing,"I was a huge fan of Cordrazine.... Hamish's voice is unique and amazing with a mezmerising quality and the lyrics are dark and brooding... Its a shame that the music on this cd consists of mostly drab deleriumesque beats that sound like early 90's throwbacks...so much could have been done with this, but in the end its just a bit boring.... if you must have make sure you get the double cd with the remix's cd for something with more depth...."
5,Fat Tenor,"Recorded NYC, Aug. 1947. Arnett Cobb, tnr, withDavid Page, tpt; Michael Wood, tmbn; Gehorge Rhodes, pno; Walter Buchanan, bass; George Jones, drmsCobb was 29 years old when this was recorded, sounding every bit the young buck with something to prove. He had just left Hampton's band, but cut these sides before he got sick at the end of 47 / 48, and well before the car accident.Listening to this reminds me how these guys had to really project their sound -- Cobb sounds so LOUD, and it ain't that he's close-mic'd. He could blow over the whold band.The greatest cut on this CD is definitely ""When I Grow Too Old to Dream""... with the band singing the words at the end."
4,Death Jr is a good game on DS,I've never played the Playstation verions of this game. I own the DS version & found it enjoyable. There are some places in the game where I was stuck.. but eventually figured it out. If you want some light fun. This is the game for you. If you dont like swinging from hooks & learning different jumps.. find another game. If I had to make the decision to buy this game again - I would. Good luck with your game of Death Jr!
1,Making the Rhinehart Erhard Connection,"Weird logic? A cult following? An anti-psychiatry bias? Can it be, oh my, I'll betcha. Perhaps they are in close communication yet. Or spiritual twins, maybe, with the Aryan Germanic ""nom de guerre"" being the thing that jumped out at me. One wonders if Werner Erhard, who bragged he hadn't read a book in years, has perused Mr. Rhinehart's work. Was he pleased, entertained, or did he have the usual narcissistic reaction of rage at the gall of someone ""copying"" his ideas? Making the connection isn't really that much of a leap, just a look at the list of other books written by the author. His obeisance to his original inspiration should indicate a cautionary disclaimer; No matter how bad it looks on the surface, its sub rosa content is exponentially worse. If you liked est, this will probably make perfect sense to you."
1,Trash,I cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews. I have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst!I am amazed that all the references to CHILD murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers.
5,A timeless thought provoking classic.....,"This book was written in the year in which I was born, yet the questions it poses and the impact the answers have hold a real impact on today's 20-something generation, a generation disillusioned with work / marriage / mortgages and commercialism. Empowering yourself with the ability to run your life in a random (or not so random - you decide) fashion is exciting, exhilarating and downright dangerous, a delicious alternative to corporate life. Buy it now - that's one thing you don't want to leave to chance."
5,What an eye opener!,"Ok, some of the topics are a bit off limit, like killing or raping based on the whim of the die! But the general theory behind is just mind blowing. I am really gonna start applying it in my life, at least whenever I am faced at making decisions which normally takes me so much time."
3,A bit long...,While I found the premise of this book mindblowing and very liberating I felt that it was a very long and tedious read. It could have been summed up in around 250 pages instead of over 400. But other than that the idea that life without a concrete personality is the way to go is an extremely wild thought to ponder. I think you really have to be in the right mood to read this book.
2,"A good idea, but overworked.","The Dice Man is a good idea but hopelessly overworked. The concept of letting an arbitrary force decide the course of your life is interesting, and could even be portrayed as exhilharating, but in the hands of such a verbose, overblown stylist as Luke Rheinhart it quickly looses its appeal."
4,The dice told me to read it again !,"An absolutely addictive read. The thing I found most worrying was it's believability as an autobiography - Luke Rhinehart made even the most obscene,amoral acts seem ""spiritually enlightening"". The book gripped me from start to finish and left me wanting more."
3,DEGENERATION,"In the beginning I could not put this book down. It was intelligently and well written and full of promise. The concept of breaking away from traditional thinking experiences and pushing your personal boundaries further and further out was exciting. Good food for thought.Alas, by the middle of the book it became apparent that the dice were taking over authorship, and from then on the story slowly and steadily degenerated into a plotless mess."
4,Mindf*ing,This book gets four stars from me. That's because it is FICTION. Woe to those who are thinking about dice-''living''.Now that this little detail got out of the way this book is exhilarating fun entirely mindf*ing. It will mess with your ideas morals and it will change you -depends who you really are- in small or big ways. It is a very exciting story of a person who goes too far with his own idea of destroying the self. Comical and extreme circumstances are everywhere in this story.Read it only if you are in need of mindf*ing and need to get out of it.
4,Memorable!,This book will definitely change the way in which you view chance! This is one of the most fascinating books I have read in quite some time. Strongly recommended!
5,Interesting.,"Good read, and very interesting! Love it. Great book to read when you have to kill time anywhere you go."
5,addictive and utterly irresistible.,"Luke pushes you to the limit of your own logic, slowly making you understand him. You end up embracing his logic only so he can take you places you'd never go. Sort of in a Nabokov way, you become Humbert Humbert, only to realize that in this case, Lolita is your own destiny, and you are messing with her in ways you really shouldn't. And it's so funny, it's addictive."
2,Missed opportunity,"A brilliant mind which could of have enlightened in progressive original ideas, it buried it instead in hormonal obsession. It could of had as well shocked us positively in many other areas of life other than than in the sewage area."
2,Not a true story!,"When I realized this was not a true story I did not order. I wanted to learn some truth from this book, but then realized it could be misleading."
2,hmmm interesting...,"I am not really sure what exactly this novel is getting at. It is supposedly semi-autobiographical in nature, although Rhinehart frequently justifies his character's `six-sided' philosphy with such clarity and conviction, that we can only assume that this book is the work of a madman.Rhinehart's character intriguingly explores many different avenues of development, opened by the die determining his periodic identity. This is an interesting concept, and at times makes for an exciting read, but his concept of becoming a completely `random' man soon becomes tiresome, and does in no-way justify 650 pages."
3,Book Review,The book was good but not what I was looking for. I wanted a book to assist with developing Access application to analyze data trends.
1,Microsoft Access Data Analysis: Unleashing the Analytical Power of Access,The book is for people who have experience w/Access. The website to download examples is not active and the support people at the publisher do not respond to email requests. Very dissapointed
2,"Well organized but poor explanations for ""on the go"" use.","Perhaps the biggest short coming of this book is the author's assumption that you will sit down and read the book from cover to cover. He writes each chapter under the assumption that you have just finished the chapter before and completed all prior exercises. Rather than explaining concepts ""cold turkey"" he references earlier examples and give short, curt explanations for functionality. If you're in the working world and need a quick answer, this is not the book for you. You're better off with another book of even Access help on Microsoft's web site. Although the author clearly knows his material, this book is only best used in a classroom setting and not for real-world reference."
5,Excellent,excellent product. This is the third book i've ordered. giving them to friends after i've gone through the pause. solves many problems in your head!!!!!
3,"Good, but out of date","The Pause is an easy, informative read if you're interested in finding out what perimenopause might have in store for you. Many recent complaints I have are related to perimenopause, and I hadn't been aware of the connection. However, if you're looking for information on how to treat or alleviate symptoms, skip this book. This book hasn't been updated since 2000. In light of all the new information in the last few years regarding the problems with hormone therapy, this book is very out of date."
3,Comprehensive,"While this text offers a comprehensive treatment of the subject, I found it to be somewhat too verbose. There should be more diagrams and other comprehension aids. At times it felt as though I was reading a doctoral thesis."
5,Delicious tea,"I got this item remaindered at Grocery Outlet, and for a bagged tea,I really like it. It's not up to the quality of the bulk teas I getfrom the UK and a tea purveyor, but it's got a nice bouquet, and goodflavor. Of course, since it's not a white or green tea, CelestialSeasonings will probably drop it, like they did their wonderfulApricot Ginger."
5,"Exceptional product, high quality","How wonderful that Amazon offers gourmet food! I love this tea and cannot find it in any store within a hundred miles of me. It's fruity and delicious, the perfect relaxer after a long day!"
4,Good Tea,"The tea is good. It smells really good when brewing. Amazon has a problem with the ASIN for this, if you order this instead of the 20-count box Amazon will ship you a 10-count box. I have written to them about this but haven't seen it corrected on the website even now."
2,Incomplete and verbose,"Length:: 1:13 MinsThis book has plenty of words but not a whole lot to say. The first few chapters are a decent overview and provide a good foundation for your pediatric rotation in medical school. Otherwise, the book isn't that good. It doesn't have enough details to make you satisfied that you're learning something. It's a textbook that tries to be both complete enough and simple enough for med students that fails on both frontiers."
2,Not worth the money,Not a very good book. This book is not very helpful. It doesn't provide enough information on each topic. I tried to use it while on the pediatrics clerkship but it was not useful.
4,RPG,"A GURPS Supers setting for the Wild Cards Universe, a game which suits reasonably well.A lot of interesting info for the Wild Cards fan who is not a game, too, so worth grabbing if you come across it just for that reason alone, really, to see the characters detailed."
3,"Too Much Influence, Not Enough Identity","Rivulets, or more accurately one Nathan Amundson, have obvious influences -- Sigur Ros, Low, Mark Kozelek in his various incarnations. My problem with You Are My Home is that Rivulets fail to transcend those influences or meld them into their own identity so that by the end of the CD I felt, ""well, that was OK, but what's the point?"" In other words, heard it all before. I burned the title track, Motioning, and Morning Light and filed the CD away, probably forever."
1,not happy,"sent an email in regards to the tv tuner, doesn't work ....seller didn't reply ...they don't give a flying hoot ( I coul'd use a better word )....I will never ever shop on Amazon again And I know that none of my friends will either....."
3,Great--but can't compare to the original studio versions.,"This historic 2-CD set pays tribute to one of Puerto Rico's most respected and beloved bandleaders. Olivencia's band can still play and swing hard and singers Sammy Gonzalez, Simon Perez, Paquito Guzman, Viti Ruiz, Marvin Santiago and Hector Tricoche all add plenty of vocal magic with their improvisations. Unfortunately, this band's two most famous singers (Frankie Ruiz and Chamaco Ramirez) have both passed away and it's difficult to imagine their songs successfully covered by others (although Perez' renditions of the classics ""Plante Bandera"", ""Doroteo"" and ""Evelio Y La Rumba"" are very faithful-to-the-originals ones). Great Salsa from one of Puerto Rico's greatest bands but these ""Live"" versions can't really compare to the originals."
1,I have never gotten the book nor a refund,The sender said my address was wrong and charged me $8.00 to send it again. I asked them to cancel the order and refund my money. I haven't received it yet.
1,Get it straight Paramount,"I am disappointed in the latest reissue of ""Chipmunks Go To the Movies"" The only new addition would be ""The Pearl of Wasdom"" toon. I ALREADY own BATMUNK and the other cartoon on another DVD. The art is nice on the box, but Paramount really needs to get their act together and release cartoons that younger fans haven't seen...It is a real shame to see how Parmount has done a terrible injustice to the Chipmunks and how the shows are being released to DVD. I am about ready to stop buying the DVDs... I passed on this release.. I rented this from my library and was disappointed..."
3,not as good,as some of Andre Williams other stuff from the 60's (see the CD Red Beans And Biscuits). Where is a CD with the original Shake A Tailfeather and Twine Time?
4,Helpful,I purchased this book to assist me in my use of STATA for a research project and to help get me through a grad level stats class. This book was much easier to reference than the volumes of manuals that come with STATA. I found it helpful as a desktop reference while using the program.
4,Excellent reference tool,"I'm a PhD student at a Top 25 business school. In much of my research I do a lot of econometric analysis. If you already have used statistical software before, then not only is Stata with all its support the package to use, but this book by Hamilton should be your quickstart guide.It is very easy to read, and very logical. But probably most importantly, at the beginning of each chapter it provides example commands, along with popular parameters you might use along with those commands. Which means that if you are familiar with what kind of analysis you want, typing it into Stata is just 2 minutes away with the help of this book.My only complaint -- and it is a significant one I believe -- is that this reference doesn't do a very good job of describing the panel data commands. Granted, panel data may be a little advanced for this ""tidy"" thing but I think even 20-25 pgs of panel data analysis and examples would have improved the entire presentation immensely."
4,Not bad,"There has been a lot of updates with Stata since, so if you're using this book with Stata 10 or 11, there are a lot of commands missing. Nonetheless this is quite a good guide for beginners."
3,"Readable, but not brilliant","It was a quick read, but I thought it lacked depth, substance and good writing. A very depressing story in a slightly mediocre package."
5,Great collection of favorite bits!,"A neighbor loaned me their copy of this dvd the other day to watch with my toddler and I had to order a copy of our own because he loved it that much! Even though he's seen most of the material on other dvds or in the series, this is still a great compilation and perfect for when we don't necessarily have time to watch a whole dvd. (We do the same with the Silly Songs dvds, too ... pop one in just long enough for one or two songs while getting ready to head out.)"
2,the de-evolution continues,"I really can't recommend this beyond to those who are already big Devo fans, such as myself. It really is a corny, mid-80s synth pop album. It's completely dated and has maybe three entirely good songs on it. I would only buy a CD remastering on it if had any bonus tracks."
3,Listen up spuds,"This album is not one of devo's great ones but it is still devo! I can't realy say a bad word about this band but unfortunately not as inspirational as some others ,like ""duty now for the future""! Still a must for hardcore devo fans."
5,Grap a cold one and enjoy,"Lots of fun to build very cool model with many options. The nalguir (cold ones) look great and are tons of fun to paint. The elves on top are very detailed and come with many different options for weapons, shileds and armomr. This is the most impressive and fun to paint cavalry units currently availible for painters and collecters."
4,Rather Challenging for Young Children,"The difficulty level seems a bit above the typical Spiderman fan age, but perhaps I am not aware of an older kids and adult fan base. However, my 6 & 8 year olds enjoy producing the character moves, even if they haven't mastered the game strategy. As a parent, I like that so-called foes can be seen in a different light -- as a friend or teammate. This makes a point that even a ""villain"" maybe isn't all bad. I'm not crazy about the beat-'em-up part, but there is no gore. It looks like an animated comic book, and therefore is obviously fantasy, not reality."
3,"Not bad, not great","First of all, you'd expect to be able to do a lot of web swinging. Well, you can swing, but the web line doesn't attach to anything, you swing about 6 inches off the ground and 5 feet forward, and drop down. No variety in swinging. Spidey's attacks are limited and do little damage. The gameplay is very repetitive. Often when you encounter new enemies, you're forced to wait 5 seconds to watch them appear out of thin air. Eventually, that gets annoying. The only thing that changes in the game, really, is the scenery. If you have a lot of patience and low expectations, it can be a good game."
4,Too short even for an 8 year old boy,I bought this game for my 8 year old boy for his birthday. This game was good and he had a lot of fun with it. The only negative comments we have would be the length of the game. It would have been better if the story mode was a bit longer and and if there were more variations with the moves and actions of the characters.
3,good game for less hardcore gamers but can get boring for older kids,"i got this game for christmas just as an extra present.Pros:fun versus mode.easysimplelots of missions so this is not a game that you beat in a short amount of timecons:enemies appear form nowhererepetitive gameplaycartoony graphicsnon interactive controls so even though ti is a wii game it plays just like any other system.too easy for serious gamers such as my selfversus mode requires that you unlock levels by playing story mode so you only start out with one level...this is a great game for kids around the ages of 6-12 especially if they arent into long story modes and difficult gameplay, if violence is an issue this shouldnt be too bad because all you do is punch, throw and smash the enemies into the ground until they disappear into nothingness, great for younger players but for older kids try something else"
5,Dangerously hilarious and outrageous novel,"The gods--all of them!--have formed the third congress for the evaluation of sin because they don't understand the flap about money. Why is everyone so interested in it? WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT???To answer this, they ""take"" two people and watch them interact. At first it's just supposed to be the two interacting with each other, but pretty soon the gods get into the picture, too. Zeus, acting the part of a horny municipal court judge, dodges Hera's wrath while chasing all the supernatural skirts he can. N'Zuriel (""Little Yaweh"") keeps hitting the pause button situated on the side of his throne to stop action so that they can catch up on and analyze (incorrectly) what they're seeing, then restarts the action when they're satisfied. Know how sometime you lose track of what you're doing? That's when N'Zuriel hits the button.Want more? Find the book. Prepare for belly pain from excess hilarity."
1,broke in 1 second,First time I turned on the water supply from my house (1/4 turn)the quick release valve broke. Everything else looked like it worked well. As long as you don't turn off the water on the shower while hose water is still on you should be ok. Kind of defeats the purpose though so this one is going back.
4,outdoor shower,really love it.. converted swimming pool to vegie garden and this is great on a hot day
2,Release valve broken,Worked well for a month then I turned it on one day and water is shooting from the back where the hose attaches coming from the valve. On inspection it looks like the valve is cracked. Not sure how to replace this part. Any ideas or suggestions?
2,was unable to get,"apparently the shipper was all out of stock for this shower. They called and asked if we would accept a shower cabana at no extra cost. We agreed to see if it would be something that would work. Once we received the shower cabana, we were impressed with the fabric type casing that you had to inflate. It was very cute, but if you are over 5 ft. tall, you would have to dunk your head to get in! So, we had to return the shower cabana. We are still hoping to order just the shower when it comes back in-stock. The shipping was very fast. However, the box it came in was so small (cabana was neatly rolled/packed in the box) that there was no way after inflating the cabana that we could get it back in the box. Sure wished we would have gotten the shower to begin with."
2,Not worth the price tag,"The only reason purchase this tripod is for the smooth panning, which it does indeed have. However, I can buy a very similar tripod for around $12 that doesn't pan smoothly. whether or not it's worth all that extra money is up to you. if you are interested i would take it another step further, and just get the vt-132 model. professional in every sense of the word."
4,Great book!,"I found this book in my local book store while looking for another book - the cover caught my eye - I hate to admit - and I read the synopsis on the cover. I didn't buy it then but the plot kept creeping up over the next few days and I went back and bought it. I loved the book and read it in two straight days. The narrative is great and compelling. I loved the ending and thought it moving. Lots of great relationships between the characters and lots of food for thought: ""What would I do if I was in the same situation?"". It's not obvious and makes you ponder. Some of the main characters new ""abilities"" can be a bit of a stretch but I easily suspended disbelief. Looking forward to more from Glynn!"
4,Solid and interesting.,"I bought this book after watching the film 'limitless', so I had a fair idea what was going to happen.There were some differences between the book and the movie, which in my opinion added to the story. The book starts at a frantic pace and continues to keep it up throughout, ensuring that I didn't leave it down for too long, a real page-turner."
3,An entertaining read but little more,"I bought this novel based on the synopsis and customer reviews I found here. I usually like techno-style, sci-fi thrillers with a realistic edge. The Dark Fields is certainly not a bad read but it lacks that extra something which makes it truly unique or unforgettable. It's fast-paced and original, but never gripping. Especially the end I found a bit predictable and disappointing. Still I'm looking forward to Glynn's next book."
2,Dear Diary,"Glynn began with a fascinating idea. But his execution of it was weak.I must say that I enjoyed the story. That said, I must also say that I did not enjoy the way the story was presented. ""The Dark Fields"" had many thrilling moments. However, these moments were widely spaced, and the blanks between were filled with mundane details. This novel quickly began to feel more like a journal of daily events, some of which just happened to be interesting.""Dear Diary,I had a headache this morning, so I drank some coffee and took a shower. This afternoon I had a run-in with the Russian Mafia. Tonight I went to the bar, then came home to work on my editing projects.""Decent book, but I traded it in for something else."
1,The music is highly superficial as is its creator:El'Zabar,"The very idea that El'Zabar proclaims himself to be African-centered is a disgrace. His music, wardrobe and name are masks used to exploit women and in that sense he is world renown"
3,Cool toy - but wings are hard to release,"My son just loves this toy. The problem is that he would really like to go between the car and the plane easily. This toy, when you want to go from car to plane - the wings just don't release very easy - my son is unable to do it himself - and I need a tool to do it. Bad design - but great toy otherwise..."
5,Great for a cars fan,"My 4 old son saw this toy in the store and would beg to go to the store to see ""his blue lightning."" We went ahead and bought it for him. It is nice that it is both a car and a flying toy. I would not recommend this for small children since the missiles come off. it also comes with an off switch!!"
4,I want blue lightning mcqueen with a button on the roof and wings....,....so goes a 3 yo who eventually wore us down enough to track this thing down (would love to know how he knew it existed but he won't share that secret)....Pretty good - a tad noisy when you have a hangover though - but then 3 yo's and hangovers seldon mix do they?If Pixar keep up the marketing they'll be 27 variants of Lighnting McQueen by Christmas!
3,Not one of his favorites,I gave this to my almost 3 year old son for Christmas and this isn't one of his favorites. It's still to dificult for him to get the wings to lift up. This may be better for an older child.
2,Don't bother,"When the car arrived, I noticed the sticker on the front hood was kind of curled, so I tried to reinforce with Krazy Glue. Now it just looks messy. Also one of the shooters is already stuck so that it cannot be removed from the wing, no matter how hard we pull. Ridiculous toy."
4,Exactly as described,My son is going to love this when he opens it up for Christmas! The picture shows exactly what you will receive. Love it.
2,"Confusing directions, batteries NOT included","We purchased this for a four-year old who's not really into the Cars movie. But we liked the idea that it transforms to a plane. It does transform, but the directions on how to get the wings out are confusing. And actually popping them out was tough for the child.The noises it makes are really cute and fun - dinosaur, etc. But they're barely audible. Why? The description says the car comes with batteries But they are DEMO batteries. The instructions tell you to take them out and replace them right away. Then you can actually hear the car's sounds. (Is this a first-time audible toy buyer mistake that all parents are actually prepared for? Felt like misstating to me.)Also, be aware that the car launches pointy plastic things aka missiles and bombs."
5,Excellent book,"Between this book and the Barry Maher book on yellow pages advertising, you'll have just about everything you need to know about small business advertising. Stop the phone company ripping you off--be informed."
5,good book 2,"This book is worth the money. The tips and ideas presented are easy to follow and useful, in my opinion."
4,If P.G. Wodehouse wrote science fiction...,"this is what he'd have written. TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DOG is a great homage to Wodehouse's light, fluffy romantic comedies about bewildered British upper-class twits in love. (References to Jeeves are dropped in to let you know the resemblance isn't accidental.) Two time-travelers from the future (on a properly Wodehousian absurd mission) accidentally interrupt the wooing of some exceedingly silly Victorian couples, with unexpected impact on the space-time continuum. As they struggle to set right what they have disturbed, there may be just the faintest hint of a more serious thread about Providence -- but not nearly enough to weigh down the gossamer-light comedy. A fun book."
5,Best Book Ever,I Dare you not to Love this book and not to finish it as fast as you can !! The perfect mix of historical sci fi romance mystery mystery novel refrences humor ( I laughed so loud I snorted )!!!
3,Good - but no comparison to The Doomsday Book,"I LOVED The Doomsday Book (have read it 4 times now) and when I found that To Say Nothing of the Dog had some of the same characters - I was ecstatic. However - this book was a bit of a chore to read, where The Doomsday Book was a joy.Mr. Dunworthy - one of the main characters of TDB only makes brief appearances, and the book suffers for that. Ned - the main character - is not very bright, and it's hard to get involved in his escapades. It's not quite as tightly written as TDB, and I'm going to assume this is a prequel of sorts.If this is your first Connie Willis book - you'll probably like this (though it's not particularly funny as promoted on the cover). After you finish it - IMMEDIATELY pick up The Doomsday Book, clear your calendar, and enjoy."
2,big disappointment,"i'm a sucker for time-travel stories, and english humor, and loved Willis' earlier stuff, but this just left me utterly cold. It's not particularly funny, the plot isn't particularly involving (and loses rather than gains steam), and it's offhand assurance that the world revolved around England is a bit dated. I read this on a plane flight, a captive audience if there ever was one, and was squirming in my seat and hoping for some peanuts to relieve the tedium."
2,Disappointing waste of time,"A truly annoying novel -- well written, vivid, but utterly pointless. Combining the worst elements of the historical romance novel, the detective story, and pseudo-science fiction. As another reviewer said of another Connie Willis book, ""A pleasant diversion, but there's little for the reader to take away when she's done."" Third-rate waste of first-rate writing talent."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Willis fills the book with quotations from great English authors and references to crucial battles throughout history. In my opinion, the title of Shakespeare's play best characterizes all the hubbub. She has taken what could be a nice 30 page satirical short story and stretched it out for nearly 500 repetitive pages. The characters are silly and the plot is preposterous. Chaos theory is interesting, but don't look to understand it better by reading this book."
4,In a word: Funny!!,"A trip through time to the Victorian Era, with all its propriety and weirdness. With some extremely funny situations. I especially liked it when the time travelers all got up in the morning, expecting a good, old-fashioned Victorian English breakfast - you know, eggs, bacon, hot bread, coffee. I won't spoil it for you here, but let's just say it had nothing to do with eggs and bacon.This is her funniest - complex, but very light-hearted."
5,More to it than you might think,"What the various reviewers have said about this being a very funny science fiction romance is quite true. I would just like to add that it does actually have some serious ideas in it, though they are very subtly suggested. ""God is in the details"", a character says (to the annoyance of the others) near the start, and only at the very end do you realize that there is a serious point here. The book would be well worth reading just as an entertainment, but you may find it has a little more to offer than you at first realize."
4,An amusing read-- Connie Willis does it a second time.,"I enjoyed ""The Doomsday Book"" very much, but after reading Ms. Willis' other books, I concluded that she was one of those authors with only one good book in them, not that there is any shame in that.After I heard that ""To Say Nothing Of the Dog"" had won the 1999 Hugo for best novel, I thought I give her books another try. Is is as good as ""Neuromancer"" and ""Ender's Game""? No. But is is nevertheless a highly entertaining read, and every bit as good as ""Doomsday Book."" I read it straight through in one sitting, staying up late to finish it. I *had* to find out where (& what) the bishop's bird stump was!"
5,Hugo Winner In Sci-fi But Also A Romance & Satire,"Connie Willis managed to combine several books into one without making it the size of the Bible. In fact, it is a normal size paperback where she rolls together a time-travel tale from the future back to Victorian England, with a romance, and one heck of a comedy. It all works and it must have taken an enormous amount of skill to combine all of these elements flawlessly. The only person she topped in the time-travel subgenre was herself. Some years before she had written ""The Doomsday Book"" where she sent the main woman character back to the middle ages during the plague. That didn't have the humor of this book but it was a real nailbiter as one character after another came down with the plague. I am not a fan of time-travel novels and it takes a lot to get me to read one but here you find a master at work within that subgenre. Accept no imitations; Willis is ""the one."""
5,"Entrancing, To Say Nothing of the Dog (and penwipers)","This is a really good book! I just finished it today, and... wow! Almost the whole tmime I was rather confused about what everything meant (well of course I was supposed to be, it's a mystery!), but at the end it all got sorted out and I was surprised!I loved the character development, and the way the plot twisted and turned, yet all made almost perfect, flawless sense in my mind. And it's so weird how everything that's happened all works out at the end. You'll just have to read it to know what I mean.(All the little references to Three Men in a Boat, Agatha Christie, Darwin, and the Titanic, among other things, are interesting as well. Plus the penwipers and interesting bulldog history and cats with pantaloons and baby talk, etc.)All in all, this is a great read that you won't have trouble getting involved with. Very intriguing."
5,Funny and interesting,"This was a great book! The whole time travel idea is interesting, with the way that the past and the future get tangled up with each trip. It was also just really laugh-out-loud funny in a lot of parts, which makes a nice change from all the dark fantasy out there. I'll be looking for more from Connie Willis."
4,Laugh out loud mystery,This was the first book in a long time that had me laughing out loud (well snickering anyway). The first part of the story takes a little effort to get past because the main character is suffering from disorientation. Other than the initial confusion I have no criticism of the story. A very entertaining read.
4,Thoroughly entertaining novel,"To appease the fanatically demanding Lady Schrapnell in charge of Coventry Cathedral's restoration, time-traveling historians from the future are under pressure to find an obscure unattractive flower vase-""The Bishop's Bird Stump"" in time for the consecration ceremony. In the process, it appears one of them may have inadvertently caused an incident back in the Victorian era which needs to be rectified. Ned Henry is sent back to try and set things right. The problem is he's missed important details of his proposed mission because he is suffering from ""time lag"".Mostly this novel is a hysterical, historical comedy- but it also is a love story, a debate about the importance of the individual's actions vs. fate or chance, a detective novel and, well it is so much more. A few times there were parts I felt were a bit tedious but overall I'd have to say I loved this book"
5,"Whimsical, entertaining time-travel novel.","Willis does time travel best, and this book is no exception. Laugh-out-loud funny at times, she uses the novel as a tribute to Jerome K. Jerome and as a forum to 'lighten up,' in contrast to -Doomsday Book-. If possible, I recommend reading Jerome's -Three Men In a Boat (to say nothing of the dog)- first, as some of the more humorous moments will take on a second meaning. (Not reading Jerome's book would not detract from Willis' novel, though.) A must read for Willis fans."
5,"Charming, witty, literate and extraordinarily satisfying","Willis outdoes herself in writing *To Say Nothing of the Dog*, showing herself able to combine the best of Science Fiction writing with the victorian English novel. This work is gratifyingly literate in both style and substance, and is deeply amusing. A treat in every respect, and frequently howlingly funny. And the ending satisfies deeply. Just a delight."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Another book by Connie Willis that didn't really interest me, I didn'treally find it either engaging or amusing enough to bother too muchwith.The bishop's bird stump is something I have forgotten aboutcompletely, and didn't really care whether this motley crew ever foundit at all in the first place."
1,Not a Real Hardbound Book,"This is only a copy (and a poor one at that) of the Bantam paperback with a harder cover. It is not an actual hardbound of the book. In addition, it is so cheaply made that there are hardly any margins and you can't even read all the words by the inner margin."
1,The book itself is poorly printed and bound.,"This is the worst manufactured book I've ever seen. The pages are pulp paper, and the printing goes from edge to edge with no margins at the sides or top or bottom. I can't even read some of the words at the center of the book because they are hidden in the binding. Because the print covers the entire page, with no white space, I'm getting ink all over my fingers trying to hold the pages open.Reading a book should be an enjoyable experience. This book reeks of being poorly printed just so you'll have to buy an expensive Kindle for $400 in order to actually enjoy the story. Shame on the publisher."
1,Couldn't get into this,I made it three chapters before I just couldn't take it any more. This was agonizing.
5,"An amazing, exciting page turner","This book had an amazing combination of time travel and romantic comedy. This is only the 3rd real page turner book that I have ever read, and it could very well be the second best book that I have ever read.Willis created just the right number of highly in depth characters who's interaction is hilarious cover to cover."
4,It takes a certain type of reader,"Once I got past the first 50 pages and into Victorian times with the two lead characters, I found this book thoroughly entertaining. The storyline is a combination of science fiction/romance/humor/Victorian upper-class manners study that is pretty unique.Hardcore science fiction buffs will probably not care for this book at all. I found the pages and pages of speculation about the ability/inability to change history to be tedious. That was a large part of the reason I didn't like the portion of the book set in the future (2050's). Still, some of the characters in this book were quite hilarious, and it was a worthwhile read."
4,A satire on the Victorian Period,"If this book is ever made into a movie; it would have to cast John Clease in the starring role. He is perhaps the only British comedian that could carry the humor as well a Willis does in the book. Willis is able to rip apart the era though without any malice. He timing is perfect and her wit right on mark. When Verity sneaks into Ned's room at night (to discuss their mission, nothing that you couldn't read to your kids happens)he resonds, ""What are you doing here! It's the Victorian era"" or something like that."
4,Enjoyable time-travel mixed with Victorian manners.,"This is a delightful book. It is a ""hard"" time-travel story with many twists and surprises. The time-travel consequences are completely logical and believable. It is a lot of fun to read. Good plot, interesting and funny characters. Many mysteries abound for the reader to solve. (I didn't.) If you like time-travel stories and a pleasant romp, this is a book for you."
4,Complex plot twists and huge laughs,"Ever felt you didn't quite know what was going on ? Well that's just how most of the characters in this book feel, and with good reason. Willis drops all the clues you need, but tricks you into missing them. The style is superb, hugely funny, I just couldn't put it down."
3,Disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Doomsday Book, and found this follow-up to be largely disappointing. It was fun to track the literary allusions throughout, but the science-fiction element was bland at at best, and I was not at all able to connect to the characters. It's above-average science fiction, but not Hugo/Nebula award-worthy"
3,No rest for the travel-lagged in Victorian England,"""To Say Nothing Of the Dog"" is a charming book in which a time-traveler of the future tries to get some much needed rest and relaxation in Victorian England. He is, of course, drawn into various misadventures which include Victorian courtships, missing antiques, and half-drowned cats (to say nothing of the dog).*** I was hoping for more time-hopping action and less time in Victorian lace and boots, but credit has to be given to the author who references not only ""Three Men in a Boat"" but Dorothy Sayers' sublime Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane."
3,overly long in a dickens sort of way,"That's my main complaint, and, I must confess, my prejudice. The story is in the style of a Dickens novel, long on descriptions and characterizations. The story is big on atmosphere and morals, and truly sets up the reader in the proper period. But, since history was not my thing, or at least, wasn't when I purchased this book, I found myself bored with some of the chapters and detours that the author takes in wrapping up the tale. The characters were well detailed, but I felt somewhat predictable, and sometimes I felt the story veered on soap operaish (probably not a word).I thought that this was a science fiction novel, but the science fiction component, or time travel, is almost irrelevant to the story. However, if Dickens was your man and you want a touch of time travel and semi-interesting theories regarding such, this is the book for you."
2,Willis Lite,"If you are coming to this book because of Willis's serious works such as Doomsday Book or Lincoln's Dreams, you are likely to be disappointed. But if a whimsical Victorian mystery is just your cup of tea, and you don't mind ""getting"" many of the clues long before the protagonists do, you may enjoy this book."
3,"Merrily, Merrily, Merrily","Funny at times, but for the most part rather slow. Read ThreeMen in a Boat(Jerome K. Jerome)first, or instead of. END"
3,Just 'Ok',"The use of a time machine obviously makes this Science Fiction, but it reads more like a Mystery Romance, which is not my cup of tea. I enjoyed it somewhat in spite of this. If you're a hard core Sci-Fi fan, you may want to pass on this book.A side issue is its comparison to ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" (Shudder!) by the Des Moines Sunday Register. I had ordered this book online and only saw that comparison on the cover when it arrived. I'm glad I did not follow my initial instinct and immediately toss it in the garbage."
2,There just isn't much to it.,"It's strange that so many people praise this book for its wit and its humor: it has neither. Fans of this book would probably argue that the humor is very subtle, but it's better hidden than that. I couldn't find any of it. Mostly the book is just dull and might have been quite good as a short story but the middle chapters seem to just fill space. We get to meet a lot of interesting characters, at least characters which are interesting until the reader learns that Willis is going to force him to sit through pages of tedious dialogue with these characters about pretty much nothing."
2,"Flashes of brilliance, long stretches of cloying frustration","This book does have a fairly intricate plot, and I did want to know what would happen to Ned and Verity...that said, do people really enjoy being clubbed over the head with a hundred redundant clues? One of the pleasures offered by fiction is puzzling out the situation--once you've figured out a particular aspect, it just becomes tedious to be given nudge after nudge, while the dimwitted protagonist stumbles around for another 100 pages.Willis occasionally hits the mark with her humor, but her tricks get old after a few repetitions, leading up to a climax of self-congratulatory literary allusions and treacly religious overtones. What a disappointment."
3,Read Her In The Library First,"I purchased several of her books because of their rave reviews and the awards these books received. If I could, I would give her 2 1/2 stars. I am a long time lover of scifi, wit, and some fantasy, and must say I was very disappointed. From now on I will read the negative reviews first as being far more realistic for this and many other things I purchased. I would recommend that anyone who has not read her before check a couple of her books out of the library before buying her work. If she is your cup of tea, great; otherwise you will save yourself some money. I agree most with the reviewer who said her awards reflect the sorry state of current scifi. I find her books overly long for the story; most of the time the book and the plot would be better served at half the length. For me she drags things out till they are tedious. I do not find her all that funny; if you like literary slapstick as opposed to wit, you might."
2,Can't get past the British English,"I am halfway through this book, and I'm not sure whether I can finish it. The rendering of British English has so many glaring mistakes that it's distracting me from focusing on the plot. The sentence structure is not quite right, some of the words are American ('gasoline'??), and the whole book just feels like watching a movie that features American actors trying to sound like English actors.Reviewers on Amazon.uk report the same problem."
4,Funny romance story with a time travel twist.,"When I first started reading this book, I couldn't stop laughing at the things that the main character was saying and the things that were happening to him. Later as the story progressed and the character started to become more lucid, the humor was gone and the plot started to pickup.It was an interesting read and I look forward to reading another book by this author to see if it's as good."
4,Excellent satire.,"Many people might not see this novel as satirical, but having studied much of 19th century literature, I certainly see that Willis' intricate and chaotic storyline, with a basis somewhere in a love story, is reminiscent of the century the characters visit. The novel is witty and historically accurate--not a common combination! Any fan of speculative fiction, 19th century literature, and great writing (as I am) will enjoy this book extremely."
3,"Perfectly decent tale, but no Doomsday Book.","The plot is good. Ms. Willis certainly knows how to toy with the concept of time travel. However, the attempts at humor feel forced at times, and the superficial nature of the characters (they are Victorians, after all) does not involve the reader. If you haven't already read it, get her Doomsday Book instead. It is a more serious book, and the characters are complex and well-drawn."
2,this time-travel mystery could not hold on to my interest,"Based on these reviews, most readers have loved this novel, and I can see why. It combines so many things - time travel, mystery, romance, science, and above all, humor. All those pieces appeal to me, but they never came together into a story I cared about. The people and era (England, late 1800's) never truly came alive to me, and that is the most important feature of a good time travel book to me. There was a British intellectual humor to this, and I know that all my friends who love Monty Python would love the humor here. But that's not me. I expect that most people who choose to read this novel will like it a lot. But if you look for a more character-based realism or the humor does not resonate quickly with you, this novel may fall short, like it did with me."
3,"Mild wit and gentle story telling, tends to run long.","The classic, Three Men In A Boat (to say nothing of the dog) is the inspiration for this mildly funny book. The classic is better, being written in a past era, rather than about a past era. This book is a work of gentle wit and slow story telling, which seems to match the pace of a slow boat ride up a lazy river. At times the central love story seems contrived, and the time travel is not well plotted.... arbitrary jumping around instead of clever construction. I like the book, but it does not jump out and bite you. A good read for slow days."
3,An amusing but messy and treacly little wine,"How do I begin? Yes, this was an amusing diversion. Yes, the chaos theory theme was cleverly explicated through manic human folly and jumble (rummage) sales filled with useless Victorian bric-a-brac. But why was the reader always a hundred pages ahead of the scientist/historian characters when it came to figuring out what was going on? Why did the author feel the need by turns to impersonate P.D. Wodehouse, Agatha Christie, Dororthy Sayers and Jerome K. Jerome and then go on to point out the deed over and over again as if the reader was thick as a brick? Why does Willis insist on sappy heroines and even sappier romances reminiscent of those Disney used to mount for the adolescent Hayley Mills? Get an editor! Get an edge!"
3,"Merrily, Merrily, Merrily","Funny at times, but for the most part rather slow. Read Three Men in a Boat(Jerome K. Jerome)first, or instead of."
2,Where was the editor?,"This book was so repetitive that if you only read every other chapter, you get the gist of the entire book. The cat played a small part in the book, but we were told about every paw licked, fish batted and eaten, and claw placement. I was ready to kill the darn thing by the end of the book. The dog wasn't much better. The first part was (I am assuming) written as if the character was really time warped, so it made little sense. However everyone in our book club did find it an excellent book to read when you can't sleep. We all dropped off within 4-6 pages making this a mid day read with lots of caffeine."
4,pure fun,"a good laugh, good charecter build up and an interesting plot. I now look at passing cats and dogs with a new eye."
5,"Penwipers, cats and the Luftwaffe","I swear, Connie Willis must collect awards for fun and profit. I've loved everything of hers that I've read, but this was the first, and still one of my favorites. She's managed to write a historical novel/romance/comedy/mystery/scifi story in one impeccable volume. While trying to unravel the various paradoxes of time travel, you're treated to the inanities of Victorian England, which can (and probably will) have you laughing out loud. With the mystery of the drowned cat, and the atrocity that is the Bishop's Bird Stump, among other things, she keeps you tied to the book up until the end - just when you think everything is sorted out, we find that we're all wrong. Ms. Willis pays perfect homage to the great writers of the past as well, so opick up some Christie and Jerome K. Jerome while you're at it. Highly recommended...."
4,"Lots of surprises, great characters","I loved this book. Had a hard time putting it down! The characters were developed so richly, it's a shame this seems to be the last one in the series for these characters. I oved the battle scenes, and the ending, was characteristically tragic."
1,If only you could feel the heartbreak i feel over this book,"i am just so sad and upset...how could she do this??i had thought up a better ending as Lean Hearn was tearing up my heart while destroying her beautiful characters.how about all the note was written and delivered around the three kingdoms so that takeo, kaede and the children can just live in the small shrine village that takeo always wanted to for his whole life? with genba and all them...instead of killing him off, instead of kaede going completly nuts and screwing eeeverything over...gosh dangit!! i hate it!!! i hate it!!! how could she??gosh, im tempted to write Lean Hearn a letter im so upset...gosh, she ruined the entire series for me, gosh dang.im so upset...i cant stop saying it..do yourself a favor and do not read this book if you liked the trilogy thus far..-Mac"
3,"enticing, but ultimately disappointing","I really enjoyed the first three books of this series and I was excited to see another. Most of the book was good, although it could have been edited down significantly - there were a few too many characters and subplots - but I was deeply disappointed in the ending. The ""climax"" came very late in the book and the ending felt incredibly rushed and unsatisfying. I feel like the characters were really disserved by that ending - so much felt unresolved, like the author suddenly decided it was time to end the book. I would love to see the ending more fleshed out, especially since this is supposedly the ""last"" tale."
3,"Not the same, but still good.","I really enjoyed the first three books, and I'd have to say this was a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the book, but it was a bit more of a labor to get through this one than the others. And I'd definitely agree that it's a disappointing finish. It seemed to be going in the right direction and I like that everything wasn't wrapped in a perfect bow, but it seems Hearn didn't quite know where to take the book, except just to finish it. There were some great ideas in this, and I was fully expecting it to carry on into a new series with a new family... that's how I thought it'd ended before and it was great. If you've read the other books, you should read this. It's not terrible by any means. It's just not the same."
1,If you care about these characters...,"Okay everybody. I'm going to tell you right now, the writing was fantastic as usual but if you care about these characters at all DON'T READ THE BOOK. Seriously. I just finished it and I'm infuriated, indignant, and honestly? Depressed. This is not an uplifting story in any way, shape, or form. I spent the entire book being really angry with previously beloved characters but expecting things would eventually end in a pleasant resolution. WRONG. You will be miserable when you finish this book. I would strongly advise you to skip it altogether and remember the characters you once loved as they were. A word to the wise, you will particularly hate Kaede. She is everything a mother shouldn't be in this book, and not much better as a wife. I'm going to have to find something to read that'll cheer me up now."
3,Three Stars - Because I'm Still in Shock,"How wonderful a story to end so stupidly......no fight.....no sword action...nothing.....I spent a lot of time and invested a lot of emotion in this series, and might as well have been slapped in the face by the way it ended......it couldn't have hurt any worse.......sorry but it's true....He had kakuta powers for god's sake...Aghhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! They are still worth reading though.....but be warned about how they end."
3,Loose ends,This last story of the Otori was as a good read until the the mid-way point. The conclusion is rushed and leaves plenty of loose ends. I was disappointed considering the high quality of the first three books.
2,The Awful Ending is an Outrage to this Extraordinary Quadriology,"What in the world happend? Did the real person behind the pseudonym ""Lian Hearn"" die after the 3rd book and someone else wrote the Book 4? How could a series that was so incredibly well-imagined and executed go downhill in a such stunning manner? It seems that the author was singularly obsessed with completing Kaeda's curse, i.e. every man who loves her dies. To deliver on this premise, the author flushed the beauty and power of all 4 books down the toilet. I'm positively fuming about this cheap bit of literary sucker punch - there's nothing honorable about how this remarkable series ended in such ignomious and pathetic manner. Had Jato been in my hand, it'll be demanding that Hearn be brought to justice live in front of all the heartbroken readers around the world.Ok.... Ohmmmmm.... [deep breath]... All that said, Otori series is a great read, impossible to put down and unforgettable. God, I'm still so mad about that stupid ending."
1,It never ends.,"I liked the first three books well enough. The first was the best (if implausible), the second quite enjoyable (even though it strained credibility) and the third was alright (absolutely unbelievable). My reading speed kept diminishing as the series progressed, but my true challenge was trying to finish this one, the fourth. This book is practically unreadable.Just as all the other reviewers have said, it's too convoluted and has too many characters by half (wracking your brain to remember who was who=not fun). NOTHING HAPPENS during the first 3/4 of the book. They travel here and there and talk unlikely politics. So finally the writer wraps up the whole mess in a narrative of the main character's fate.If you enjoyed the original 3 books, skip this and enjoy your memories."
3,Harsh Words for a Harsh Cry,"If you have read the first three books, and enjoyed them thoroughly this is a necessary read, if only to know how it all ends. Otherwise, save your time. This book is a far cry from the original Otori trilogy's context."
2,Cafeteria type quality,I hope someone walks off with mine - they are pretty basic. They really remind me of cafeteria spoons only really small!
2,Cheap spoons,"I guess you get what you pay for. Reviews said these were nice spoons, but they are cheap, stamped spoons. I would expect to find spoons like this in a diner if they served espresso but not in a fine restaurant."
2,rather cheap looking,"These are low end, low quality spoons. They've not rusted on me, but the edges and finish are a bit rough. If you need a lot, you could get by. But for a few dollars more I'd get the nicer ones."
1,An awful piece of work,"This portrayl of the Dirk Greineder murder case is an awful piece of work that is riddled with errors and sheds no new information on the case. Author Rosencrance clearly did little more than watch the Court TV coverage of this case, read the local media accounts, and consult the trial transcripts. Beyond the local police chief and several jurors, none of the main participants in the case were interviewed and there is virtually no character development. The story line is disjointed, confusing and devoid of emotion and description. Some parts read like clinical police reports while other sections are trial transcripts run verbatim. Avoid this book at all costs as the errors are too numerous to list. It does not deserve a single star but there is no option for zero stars."
3,A Killing Retold,"I had seen this crime portrayed on tv so I knew who did it. I wanted to get more detail than was included in a one-hour program. There WAS more detail about the crime and the people involved, but it was repeated at least three times; the murder was described, it was described again during in the investigation, & then all was re-discussed during the trial portion of the book. Reading about the same scenario made me less inclined to finish the book. I have seen this repetition in other true crime books."
3,Not bad,I read this book because I was well aware of the case and the trial and I have to disagree about there being a lot of errors. I understand that you may not like the style -- a lot of court stuff -- but it's wrong to say it's riddled with errors.
5,Loved the recipes and the writing,"I give this book the highest rating because of the wonderful anecdotes and recipes chosen by Ms. Rodriguez-Hunter. Paris and France in this era are favorite reading topics and I appreciate the creative mind that put these delightful chapters together. The chicken and morel dish was such a hit with my friends, I substituted oven-dried tomatoes for fresh and got an astoundingly rich flavor in the sauce. I can't wait to work my way through more recipes."
1,Eek!,"By all means, read this book for the recipes, but that is all it is, a cookbook. Don't read it for the narrative. For an author who claims to want to share her love of a generation, she knows precious little about it. One would think she would have read more. The number of factual errors is astounding. Irritating. Where is Dorothy Parker? Where are the biscuits and toppings and dry sherry made so famous by the Murphy's? Although the food is mentioned time and again in the many biographies, it is nice to read the actual recipes, except for Zelda's, which she had penned herself. Not worth it."
4,"Good Coffee, Hard to Get the Water In",This coffee pot works great. It disperses the water over the grounds in a way that helps release the most flavor from the coffee. My only two knocks are that the lid on the pot does not come off and it is very difficult using the pot to get the water into the resevoir in the back of the machine.
3,"Fast, but messy","Everyone else says it, but I ignored them; how hard can it be to avoid spilling and dripping? Almost impossible, it turns out. I solved the difficulty in filling the tank by using the sink sprayer. That involves moving the coffee maker over to next to the sink to fill it, but that is no big deal. The most frustrating thing for me is that the carafe always spills a few drops as you quit pouring. But the Melitta Fast Brew is fast, which is why I bought it."
5,Plugged In,"The cord works well for the Ford Powerstroke application. Going straight forward along the frame rail and out by the fog lights works well. If you try to go up to the battery, it will work, but exercise caution when routing near the exhaust manifold. There is no need to use heat wrap if you are careful. If you think you might drive off with your vehicle plugged in, try not to secure it to other wire bundles!"
5,What a Hunk!,I love these movies with Will Smith! They are action packed with a touch of romance and comedy! He is amazing.
2,Just another one of those vanilla books,"I've been in the process of reading this book just to read it in recent weeks. You could read this book in one sitting. If you are a Tiger fan, a Kirk Gibson fan or maybe a Dodger fan you might have a fleeting interest in this book. However, that interest will end when you realize it presents very little meaningful information that you probably didn't know or hear already at one time. I can't imagine anyone that just has a general baseball sense really embracing this book.If you can find it at a bargain price and are a Tiger fan, there may be some value into getting it. But, honestly, save your money for some other books out there. You can find something better."
5,elderly video,this is a great video for the elderly. Primarily wheelchair bound people. There is range of motion half for the upper extremities and the other half the lower extremities I have a group of elderly people and they love to use this video
2,Review of Cable USB008-3,Cable for my Nokia 6133did not fitThere was mis-match between the cable end that should fit into the the Nokia. SF/Planet is to rebate my cost.
5,Mango Candy,"This is a delicious candy,it is a soft gummy mango candy like gummy bears. If you like gummy bears you will like gummy mango."
4,yum,"soft and chewy! tastes fresh and fruity! Seriously, a chewy candy good enough that after eating one, i am buying a bag online."
5,Using Our Greatest Tool WILL Bring Unlimited Success,"I highly recommend this book, as well as all others written by Lee Milteer. In this book Lee shares with us how to create better teamwork with God to make our lives as well as the lives of those we touch better. Our spiritual side is our most powerful asset and so few people realize it and even those of us who do really don't understand how to use it to our best advantage. Any time I have spent studying and reading Lee's work has been an awesome investment in my personal growth. I am a much better person today thanks to Lee's work."
4,Smart Book for Smart Users,"I found this book very informative. It stayed away from all the boring stuff for brand new users. Instead, it played with the new features. The chapter on Access didn't go into a lot of detail, but everything else turned out to be very helpful. For an overall Office book, I'd recommend it. It can also be very funny. I actually laughed OUT LOUD while reading a computer book. There's a first for everything, I guess."
3,"Not what I expected, but still good","I expected a lot more about Diane DeVries in this book. Although the cover describes the book as being about ""disability, biography, and being female in America"" it is really more about the practice of writing biographies and life histories. Diane's life is examined only tangentially; although there is a substantial amount of information about her, the real focus of the book is on sociology and anthropology and how they help us interpret life histories. I chose this book as my independent reading for a women's history course (it was one of several options given by the instructor) but I really feel it would be more appropriate for a sociology course, particularly sociology of gender or sociology of disability."
2,Disappointing to me.,"From reading the excerpt provided in the 'Look Inside"" feature, I thought it would be more of a biographical study of Diane. Instead it was more of a sociology thesis about different theories, ways of writing sociological material, and why certain words are used. There was much, much more of the latter and much less of the former."
2,Not one of the best In Your Houses.,"This isn't one of the best In Your Houses, so your not missing much. The matches are Roadog vs 123 Kid (2 future DX members) Mabel & Mo vs Savio Vega & Razor Ramon Bam Bam Bigalow vs Henry Godwinn Shawn Michaels vs Jeff Jarrett Diesel vs Sycho Sid Shawn & Jarrett have the best match, but this one isn't that great...Find something better to do than watch this."
3,Awesome,I have seen this PPV and it is in my POV a great event. Once you own it you'll know you spent your moneys worth
3,Readable..,"Somewhat talky, but still readable, I was able to read this in a single weekend.The character of 17 year old Charlotte, is interesting, but not totally convincing, she seems to talk as one feels no 17 year old would talk, not today's youth anyway!The lead character, George, a married 45 year old man with two kids, is typical of the lead characters that dominate Sloan Wilson's books and our lead character is about to enter a mid-life crisis of sorts, as he meets a young 17 year old girl whose mother he jilted 25 years before, to his lasting regret, only to lose her (the mother), to an alcoholic playwright who is about to take up a new position in the collage where George is vice-president."
4,Great Chaise!,"I ordered 2 chaise and very happy with them. They are a little lighter in weight than I expected. Also, the image shows the metal a little lighter than what they are. The cushion looks beige in the photo and is actually more grey. Besides all that, they match very well with an Ethan Allen set that I have. Delivery was fine and they arrived sooner than expected."
3,"Great product, horrible shipping","I've been spoiled by Amazon. if they say it will be 5 days, I get it in 2 days. So I guess I expected this to be similar, or at least on time. Instead, it took a full month after the advertised delivery date and a lot of my time and some assertive calling to get this gift delivered. The lounge chair is great (5 stars). I was especially impressed that the hooks for adjusting the back were also metal. The cushion appears durable and comfortable, and it is has a nice design as per the photo. I'd buy from this collection again, but I'm not sure I'd order it with similar shipping options (1 star)."
5,Fantastic Buy!,"These lounge chairs are hands down the best deal that I have found. They are extremely comfortable, sturdy and attractive! Plus free shipping and they come already assembled..which is a big deal for me since I am not very handy!! Great item and great deal all around!"
4,"Not high end, but a great value.","This is a good quality chaise lounge. The colors are neutral without being boring and style easily matches many patio sets. It matches mine perfectly. It looks heavy but is lightweight, yet sturdy enough for a large adult. The pad is comfortable, but it is not a high end cushion like one would find at a boutique hotel. But for the price it is a great value."
4,Nice sturdy chair,"I'im quite happy with this lounger. I had a cheaper one that broke easlily, but this one is pretty well constructed, and the cushion is rather thick, if not a little rough, but maybe that's the price to pay to be weather-proof."
1,Extortinist Shipping Company,"I can not tell you about the quality of this product because the shipping company Amazon is using will demand an extra $90.00 per item as shipping charges before they will deliver it. I purchased several of these lounge chairs with the $0.01 delivery promotion. They were to be delivered this week but the shipper ( in the Dallas area) called and demanded an extra $90.00 per lounge or they will not deliver them. I called to report this to Amazon and was told they ""will look into it"". So far I am without my lounges and my credit card has been charged. I will update when I hear back from Amazon.Addebdum:One call to Amazon took care of the whole matter and I was not charged by the shipper."
1,"WORST MOVIE EVER, EVER, EVER, IN HISTORY","I purchase many movies and I have been fortunate so far to buy pretty good B-list movies. Boy was I wrong with this one. It didn't even deserve 1 star. I don't know who rated this movie or gave it more than 1 star, but it was absolutely awful! Both the acting and plot were terrible. I don't even think this was a real production. It was like someone was following the actors around with a video camera filming. Don't waste your money or your time."
3,Not a bad movie,"Not a bad movie. Had it's moments. At times a little hard to follow, but it was entertaining. I liked the movie with reservations."
5,The Last Templar,I received this DVD very quickly. It was in great condition and I love the movie. Thank you so much for your great service.Sherry H
2,Did We Watch The Same Movie?,"Based on all of the positive reviews I read on Amazon, we rented THE LAST TEMPLAR and were thoroughly disappointed--so much so that I wondered if we had watched the same movie!I cannot fault the cast of solid actors that included Scott Foley and Victor Garber but Mira Sorvino portrayed her character like a sorority girl run amok instead of a seasoned archaeologist. And, the director actually shows a talent for staging action sequences. That said, all of this talent simply could not overcome entry-level writing and cliched, sometimes awkward plotting. At the core of this half-baked attempt to meld Indiana Jones with The DaVinci Code is the now-familiar story of the main character coming to grips with faith. As someone who believes in God, I found TEMPLAR's treatment of this theme badly mishandled and embarrassing. The film is around four hours in length and feels twice that long."
2,LOL,"This is the best movie to watch; well, not really watch but instead to make-fun-of while watching. It's so bad, it's funny!"
2,It had a chance,"But with a cast full of B-class actors, and just reasonable acting, it's hard to make it a hit. Even Sorvino, with her Botox enhanced lip, couldn't manage to save it. I guess she's been away from the mainstream films for too long. Although the plot is just one more that rides on the success of The Da Vinci Code, it's interesting, but lost its chance with a probable limited budget. Insisting on the limited budget theory, I'm pretty sure this is the main reason for the cliché and sometimes cheesy lines. It could also have had a better pace if it hadn't been for the constant interrogations and meaningless conversations between the two main characters."
3,Last Templar Movie Review - Read the Book!,"The movie was entertaining, but could have been much better. Acting was mediocre, it appears the actors were chosen on the basis of their looks, rather than by audition... Visually, the film was very well done, sets are authentic-looking. All in all, it was ""okay""."
1,Ugh!,"First off, let me put in a disclaimer. I really like Mira Sorvino. Not only do I think she's smoking hot, but I like her as an actress as well. I liked her in good movies like 'Mighty Aphrodite', and in bad ones like 'Mimic'. And I think 'Replacement Killers' is a four-star movie, one of my all-time favorite action flicks. I was even glad to see her as a guest star on 'House' last season! Despite all of this interest, I have to admit that I couldn't even get through the first 15 minutes of this TV mini-series. Such a shame - Mira still looks fantastic, but the lame dialog and cheesy directing meant I couldn't even get past the opening action scene. What a waste..."
1,"No captions, no subtitles","How is it in the modern era of television that a company is too lazy to include captions or subtitles on a disc? I've been mostly deaf all my life and have always had to use captions. Over 95 percent of the media created these days, I have no problem with... this even had captions when it was broadcast on TV (its required by law), but there are none here. If you need them, save your money. I, unfortunately, am now stuck returning a crappy item."
5,Last templar fun,"This is a made for TV movie. Although at times it is noticeably so, it is overall well done and great fun. I have watched it several times and it is fun enough to watch more than once. The basic premise is along the lines, but different, of the Da vinci code and follows closely the book by the same name. The movie leaves you wondering, but in a light way. It follows the book very closely, but it is hard to put the emotional level in the end (during recuperation on the island - cannot say more without spoiling) that is found in the book. Many times the movie is not close to the book. In this case, they are similar in quality and detail."
1,Pretty awful compared to the book,"I really enjoyed the book and thought the movie would be a nice one to add to my collection. Boy, I was disappointed. Poor acting. The woman in the movie was arrogant and flippant - and really wasn't up to the part. There was no ""connection"" to the FBI guy - no charm - no electricity - and that was so well presented in the book. They altered the story in several parts and I'll say it was a budget issue because they didn't do the parts that would have cost a lot to film - the storm at sea, for example, was skimmed over and then they were rescued. At several points, I lost interest altogether and got up and walked away. All in all, it's lucky I gave the movie one star. Read the book instead."
1,RUINED BY GOD,"This was a pretty good made-for-TV action adventure pic about a female Indiana Jones, until the very end, when the producers had Mira Sorvino suck at Jesus' teat to appease the religious right-wing fringe."
5,Breat Movie,I love this whole kind of Movie content and yes King Rthur and also Merlin Series. You wont regret this movie for sure.
4,Last Templar,Take note of the running time. This is a long movie. I like Mira Sorvino so I liked the movie more than the average person would. The action isn't super heated but it's at a pace that still keeps you interested in it. Throughout the movie the Templars are used as a tool which by the end of the movie has Tess uniting her scientific mind with a mind of faith. All in all a good movie.
1,It wasn't what I though I wqas purchasing,"need the bottom part of the frame, the part that the door sets in. Unfortunately, I do not know its proper name. The fame has a bottom, 2 sides and a bottom. Please tell me how I can get this item and what I should call it."
2,Battery Life Makes This Uneconomical,"I bought my first one of these a couple of years ago. The shave is just fine. The problem is that, after a year, the battery wouldn't hold a charge. I'd shave once and have to recharge. Then, it got to the point where it wouldn't even hold a charge RIGHT AFTER CHARGING. I had to pull it off the charger and be ready to shave right before it was done.I figured this just needed a new battery. Problem is you can't get new batteries for this. So, I bought a second, hoping that this was just an isolated case. I mean, at this price, buying one a year really isn't saving any money over blades.It happened again. I won't be buying a third one of these. Instead, I'll be looking for one by another company."
2,Dead Battery,"I got this in November 2010 & as of April 2011, the battery appears to be dead: it will not hold a charge & the shaver is very warm to the touch."
4,Not too bad..,Not too bad of a shaver. It shaves pretty close on the sides however it does not get my neck area done very well. I still have to use a blade for a clean look on my neck. It does do my cheeks pretty well and the cleaning system while it is a little loud (no biggee tho) does a really good job cleaning the blades. I haven't found one hair inside after 2 such cleanings. The trimmer part on the side is ok but you cant really see what your shaving because of the location of the blade. Overall I give this a thumbs up but I wish I had something else to compare it to. I bought it pretty cheap on the gold box deal but if I had the chance to do it again I might would have paid more for another shaver if I knew it did a better job.
5,[...],"I got this shaver for my husband for Christmas, 2006. He thinks it is the best thing since sliced bread. Granted, the shaver it replaced was serveral years old, but he is very happy with this Panasonic ES7056S Vortex. He keeps telling me I just don't know how nice it is to have to go over his face just once, with no ""scrubbing"" to try and get those rebellious whiskers. I know I am happy he is happy. Plus the price was very reasonable. I feel it was money well spent. A very good product"
1,Worst shaver in the market,I got this shaver about 6 months ago i hardly used it and within 10 uses it died on me. it never recharges and doesnt turn on moreover the company's return policy is worst in the universe.my only advice DONT BUY THIS SHAVER.thanks
2,SERIOUS WARNING ABOUT THIS SHAVER,"Technically, the Panasonic Vortex Triple Head is a most excellent shaver with one BIG problem, which is that it's vibrations emit dangerous levels of ELF (Extra Law Frequency) radiation that is destructive to neurons in the brain that are just a few centimeters away from its head when shaving. I used a special device (Extech Instruments) to measure this and it has by far the highest levels when compared to Braun and Phillips, both of which have safe levels. For the technically minded, the Braun 7570 emits 0.5 Tesla/5 Gaus while the Panasonic emits up to 50 (fifty!) Gaus which is up tp 10 times the radiation emitted by Braun.Just a little warning to my fellow men..."
1,Lousy shaver,I bought this shaver as a replacement for a Norelco Triple-head Rotary shaver; what a mistake!1. This shaver does not shave any closer than the Norelco rotary2. It takes twice as long to shave with this compared to a rotary3. The battery life is 1/3 as long as the Norelco rotaty4. It has DIED in less than 6 months.
3,So-So Results.,"two gripes.1. Doesn't get better after time. It doesn't ""learn"" your face or your growth changes. I think they say that so the return period runs out.2. Battery doesn't last long. I have to wait a few minutes then it goes on when the battery is low. Last about 5 shaves, then it does this. Mine might be defective."
3,not so impressed,"I am not impressed. And, my husband wasn't either. Doesn't give a smooth shave. It holds a charge for a long time, but we don't use it much."
5,A Must-Have,"This electric shaver is a definite must-have. I bought this as a gift for someone, and he is constantly raving about how well it cuts his facial hair. Of course, if your hair is a little on the long side, it won't cut as well and you will have to go over it with a manual razor. I love that it has the wet/dry feature, but I wish that it had a built-in lotion dispenser. I used to have an electric shaver (made by Norelco) that had 3 blades and had the built-in lotion dispenser which I miss. The fact that it cleans itself too is a plus even though it is a little loud and annoying to listen to. Overall, I gave this shaver 5 stars because of its performance."
4,Close Shave - Some Maintenance,"I purchased this shaver a few weeks ago. I'm pleased with the closeness of its shave. I'm a little disappointed that I apparently need to purchase cleaning cartridges in order to maintain its cleanliness. I'll determine later if I need to continue buying these cleaning cartridges or if manually cleaning is good enough. All in all, I'm please with my purchase."
4,cleans itself,"So far the razor has exceeded expectations and the fact that it cleans itself is timesaving and performance enhancing. As with most electrics that I have used in the past, it has some problems with the chin and neck (the sensitive areas) and doesn't shave as close as I would like and I sometimes get some irritation. But it is better than the rest including the Braun which also cleans the blades. And for the price offered you can't beat it."
3,"NIce, but!","A very nice razor, gives a very nice shave, however would probably not purchase again. The battery has not held a charge well even new and now gets only about 2 shaves before needing recharged."
1,Does not last,I bought this as a gift for my husband and about a year and a half it quiet cleaning and charging the razor. I would not recommend buying it.
3,Nice Smooth Shave,This was a gift for my son. He said this shaver gives a nice smooth shave and being able to use it in the shower is great. He doesn't like the three blades though. The head is too wide and does not contour to his face as well. In this case more is not better.
1,Piece of crap,This is a bad choice. Don't throw away your Schick. Does not shave very well. Even after going over and over my face. I am not into the nasty day old look. Just wanted to stop paying 28 bucks a pop for blades. Guess I'll buy a better one.
1,Junk,"I've owned just about every brand electric razor on the market. Braun's are great quality but grossly over priced. Norelco's don't cut close. Remington's burn your face. Panasoic provide the closest shave out of them all, but have subpar quality. I purchased this razor after a Braun I had didn't work right anymore after a year of use. The razor worked well for a month cutting as close if not closer than a blade. After that it was horrible. The razor wasn't cutting as close which is typical with Panasoic's. The solution for the system would run back in to the device housing area leaving the razor constantly wet when I would use it. To top it off when I called Panasoic they wouldn't do anything for me. Keep in mind that when my Braun broke they were happy to refund me my money after one year of purchase. Don't be cheap, buy something of better quality and be willing to sacrifice a little on the closeness of the shave by getting a better quality razor and spending a little more money."
2,"Worked well for almost two years, then gave out","I've used this shaver pretty much daily for the last couple of years, and I was happy with its performance. However, it recently stopped charging. Now the battery is dead and it will not charge. When I opened it up, there was water inside. I haven't submerged the unit nor do I shave in the shower, it got water inside from my rinsing it under the sink."
1,Bad Luck with this Razor - Terrible Service from Panasonic,"I bought this razor for my birthday in 2008. I usually use a non electric razor. I was excited that I could get this razor wet and use shaving cream. Unfortunately the razor left my face feeling chafed. After using the razor for maybe 10 times I put it away for a few months. Later, I tried to use the razor and it would not turn on! I tried recharging and tried turning the switch on and off, no sound out of the razor.I got hold of Panasonic. I was excited to hear that there is a 1 year warranty on their product, they even offered to send me a free shipping label. They LIED to me! I called them 5 times in 15 days asking what happened to the email they were supposed to send me. They told me they mailed me a coupon, I never got it. Today when I called they told me they were having problems getting the shipping labels to customers! They offered to reimburse me for mailing my unit to them. I am shipping it today. Wish me luck!"
2,So-So,"I was hoping to be blown away by this product based on the great reviews it had received but I was under-whelmed. Maybe other shavers simply can't measure up to Braun but again if you read the reviews you'd think this one would have been closer. I am not a burly, thick bearded man but it's nice to not have to use a razor every day. I find myself trying the electric but after three passes I usually give up and grab the razor. Sort of self-defeating. Sorry can't give this one even a silver star- I'd look to Braun."
2,"Locks up, misses spots","My main issue with this shaver is that sometimes it won't start. The battery's not dead- if you turn it off and on a few times it eventually starts and then it works. Granted, I don't recall it doing this fresh out of the charger, but I'd like to be able to travel for a few days without bringing the charger along.Also, it's difficult to get some areas on my neck. I used to have a norelco with 3 rotating heads, and I don't remember having that problem.Finally, keep in mind that you're supposed to replace the detergent/filter cartridge monthly, and they're currently $12 for a 3-pack, so you've got $4 a month in consumables."
5,The Hubby Loves This!!!,"I bought this for Ed before Xmas & he truly enjoys this because it's smooth & pivots the way he likes it! This model automatically cleans itself. I know we'll need to get additional cartridges, but they come in a pack of 3 & last over 3 months so that extra $15 will be worth it. It recharges fast & provides the option of a Wet or a Dry shave. He's pleased & so am I!"
3,Good shave ok cleaner,"This is a good shave but I have my doubt about the cleaning unit it shuts down after cleaning without going thru the drying phase. I have to restart and set to dry only. It has settings to set it up for recharge,clean,and dry but always turns it self off after the first process."
3,"It'd be great, if my head really were a square","I wrote a fairly negative review of this after using it just twice. I started it off with some tough jobs -- my first shave with it was five days or so of stubble -- and the battery life was unimpressive, and wasn't too thrilled about the results.Now that I've had it a few weeks, my opinion of it has risen slightly. Shaving just one day's growth doesn't chew through the battery nearly so quickly. And after using it for a bit, I got better at using it effectively.Overall, it does give a very close, comfortable shave for much of my face; better, I think, than the Norelco I'd been using for the past ten years or so. But it doesn't perform as well with the concave contours, like the neck or the back of the jaw. Because of that, though this may be good performance for the price, I don't give it more than three stars."
4,no blood,"i have not tried an electric razor in years, but i was tired of nicks from my razor. surprisingly, i did not get a rash from using this. the vortex does seem to work better after a cleaning."
2,Shaves fine but battery sucks,"The shaver did a good job of shaving, but its battery went low very fast (after 2 shaves of 4-5 minutes in about 4-5 days). One time the indicator showed high battery but before I finished the job it went off. What sucks most is that the shaver doesn't work while charging!!!Also, the battery will get worse after a year or two so you would have to either replace the battery or buy a new unit.Also, I didn't like shaving in the wet mode with soap/foam on my face, because the shaved hairs got stuck on my skin so I couldn't tell what parts are shaved and what parts not!"
2,Back to Sensor razor,"I tried it for 3 weeks with combination of dry and in shower and it just doesn't work for me. I don't have that tough a beard, yet I am back to the expensive cartridges that sent me trying an electric. See if you can try it before you buy."
3,I bought this book because of the title,"Went to school in Morgantown, and yes the Morgantown of the book is the one I remember. The nostalgia part I liked, the main dude, I had a bit of a problem relating to."
5,Cute,"This is a cute little movie...sweet story with a few ""adult type comments"" that go over the children's heads but make it fun for adults to watch as well."
2,"Wow, just wow. And not in a good way.","Well, I guess either all the good ideas have been done already, or they're just getting lazy, but this has to be one of the worst offerings from the Muppets that I've seen (and I'm not including the nightmare that was Oz since I couldn't watch it in its entirety.)Boring, yes. Unimaginative, yes. I agree that the only positive with this production is its length. Retract that, the out-takes with Nathan Lane were really funny.I understand this is a TV special and all, and they couldn't throw the budget at it like they did A Muppet Christmas Carol, but good grief. Do yourself a favor: every time you get the urge to buy this, don't and just re-watch Christmas Carol. You'll be glad you did."
2,"Boy, you can tell that there's no Jim Henson","Everything done by the Muppets since the death of Jim Henson has been sorely lacking in heart. This production had promise but it never got beyond that. Even Paul Williams' music seems to be lacking without the collaborative genius of Henson.There are a few chuckles here and there--brought about mostly by the newish character of PePe the Prawn--but I'd have to guess that Henson wouldn't be proud of this effort.And what's weirdest to me is that ALL of the Muppet's voices seem to have changed--not just Kermit's, who obviously sounds different these days since he isn't being performed by Henson. Fozzie sounds different, Miss Piggy sounds different, Gonzo sounds different, Scooter sounds different...and longtime Muppet fans will know it.Just a disappointment overall and the last post-Henson Muppet production that I'll spend my money on."
5,A must for Muppets fans!,We love the Muppets and have most of their movies. We watch them with our grandkids and always have a great time!
4,Entertaining for the kids,"Our kids liked the movie, which is the most important rating. They laughed throughout and got sad at the end, so it was a pleasant journey. Even as an adult, I still enjoy how the different muppet characters interact. Some of the parts are corny for an adult, yet the kids don't notice that. Our children are between four and nine years old."
5,I read this book straight through....,"This was different from the normal mystery. I liked the characters because they had a ""realness"" that you don't always see in books. The interaction between characters, the computer ... and well, better not give the plot away. :-) I started reading the book and couldn't put it down."
4,Came to care about the fate of the characters,"A solid first effort - good plot, interesting characters. I grew involved with the characters and wanted to keep reading to see how things worked out for them. The plot definitely picked up about a third of the way in and kept moving right along until the conclusion."
5,Wow! Awesome band!,These guys rock ferociously. All their songs are catchy as hell and the singer lookslike very tall male model. The guitarist is fat goofy hambone but plays his butt off. The drummer is also incredible. They did know they were being filmed so the performance is relaxed and unpretentious but tight and entertaining. Buy or download this. A great band like this should not be ignored.
1,This is a toy!,"Do not buy this. It is NOT regulation size. It's basically a mini sized toy, with cheap paddles and even the net is not regulation height. I got suckered in by the allure of a table top on the other side, but even that isn't useful because the wood is too thin to support real dining. It's large enough to be cumbersome, yet too small for regulation play. It will only screw up your table tennis game if you take it seriously."
1,Don't be dissappointed like I was!,If only I'd listened to the first reviewer! This is not regulation size and it does not fit a standard pool table. The accessories that are part of the package ARE sub-standard. We were so excited to be getting a ping pong table and not lose any more floor space and now we're stuck with trying to return this.
1,Bad news,"Sold me the item a week ago, just informed me today, 4 days before xmas that they don't have any. No time to find another...no time to get the xmas present for my four kids...offered to ship in Feb. Poor policies, poor customer service, no offer of resolution to problem. Bait and switch, then blamed website for still offering it but did not inform Amazon of back order, nor did they remove it from being for sale and in stock at any point in time"
4,Where loss of innocence became a reality.,The truly horrific happening at My Lai changed the attitudes of the World as to how far the military would go to cover up their acts of genocide. At least then there were men with integrity: heroic and courageous enough to make a stand. Since then such incidents have become studies in manipulation and damage limitation.
5,A wonderful cd,"This is truly a wonderful album. Libby Kirkpatrick is somewhat like a cross between Joni Mitchell and Ani DiFranco. Lyrically intresting and musically strong, this collection of 10 songs performed live at Folks Fest and Velvet Studio - just her and her guitar - is a refreshing album for any music lover.For those of you interested, and because Amazon has not as of yet posted a track listing, the songs on this album are as follows:1. Vaulted Heart2. Agony3. To A Child4. White-eyelashed Girl5. Silver Road6. One Simple Thought7. Ground Zero8. Water9. Wait10. Stand My Ground"
4,An Eye Opener!,"As a mom to 2 sons, and also as Host of BellaOnline's Sons Channel, I have always been of the opinion that boys are shaped and molded more so by their mothers words and deeds than anyone else they come into contact with. This is never more apparent than in Bonnie Angelo's book, ""First Mothers"". These women, whether knowingly or unknowingly, raised their boys to achieve the highest pinnacle of leadership our country offers. The stories told in this book are poignant, reveling and speak volumes about the mother/son bond.A must read for any mom of boys!"
3,Disappointing,"This is a rich topic, the influence of mothers upon famous men, but the author presents her material with all the depth of those admiring biographies of famous women written for junior high school girls. The reader is jerked back and forth in time while the author hops from one topic to the next while discussing presidential ""first mothers"" in a superficial and breathless style. There are a few moments of candor that make these mothers more than cardboard saints,(Eleanor Roosevelt comes in for quite a bit of criticism for her lack of mothering skills), but these moments are few and far between. When the author does permit some clouds of disapproval to darken her sunny skies, her criticisms are quickly balanced by elaborate, and rather strained, excuses for the woman's behavior. (Angelo's depiction of Mr. Clinton's mother could have been written by a rabid Clinton apologist.) Three stars because of the interesting topic although it only deserves two for execution."
4,"Superficial, but nevertheless interesting","This book gives many interesting details about the ancestry and the childhoods of presidents from FDR to Clinton. I was fascinated at how many of our recent presidents went through periods of real poverty during their childhoods.You really don't get too much information about the mothers though. It's mostly inferred from the situations and minor passing comments made by those who knew these women. The pictures are pretty few and small, so you don't always even get a good feeling of how these women looked.Also, as another reviewer remarked, it is kind of frustrating and confusing the way each chapter jumps back and forth in time."
3,Brilliant Concept,"Bonnie Angelo has a brilliant concept for a book and enough material for about one-third of her pages. The text is padded with cliches; cliched images; unattributed quotes; guessed-at thoughts, reflections and reactions; gratuitous comments and asides; contrived conclusions; uncertain focuses - now the mother, now the son, now the wife, now the wife's family. Bonnie apparently dropped her notes when she was beginning her writing and she never sorted them again. There is no order to her scrambled text.For all the fact that an editor was needed badly, this book offers some wonderfully diverting material and introductions to a neglected aspect of American history and to some notable life stories. The chapter on Sara Delano Roosevelt may be worth the modest paperback price of admission."
3,FIRST MOTHERS; Woman Who Shaped the Presidents,"Don't know how to rate the book; I bought it as a gift.My aunt had just lost her son. I thought she mightenjoy a book about motherhood. She liked it, calledto thank me for it. Since buying it, I have heardsome not-so-good reviews on the book. But I stillthink it was appropriate for my aunt."
4,First Mothers,I enjoyed this book very much and have passed it on to my Grand Daughter to read since we have a new Great Grandson just born. Who knows he could be our president someday.
3,Doesn't get my vote.,Predictable. This book only made me turn the pages because I was hoping to find some golden nugget of information that would truly link the Presidents. It was not to be found.
1,Slavish Claptrap,"A typical ""project"" from someone who has written for the likes of Time magazine to scintillate a plebian readership with ""interesting"" tidbits. Her account of Sara Delano Roosevelt is laden with errors. She was not of ""old Hudson River aristocracy"". Her father Warren Delano was from Massachusetts, as was her mother Catherine Lyman. They built their estate at Algonac, near Newburgh NY, after Warren Delano made his fortune trafficking opium into China. Sara was an elitist snob who never worked a day in her life. AS Eleanor Roosevelt said of her: she was prejudiced against anyone who wasn't of the social elite her family aspired to. Indeed, her father lost much of his fortune during the Panic of 1857 and had to return to China one more time to make a second fortune in the 19th century drug trade."
5,First Mothers by Bonnie Angelo,"Our book club read this for discussion, enjoyed the book very muchlots of information about Presidents and their mothers one usuallydid not hear. Very well written. Planning on reading more of Bonnie Angelo booksin the future."
4,A must for the beginner,"This video is very informative for the novice. If you already are familiar with the AR then no need for this vid. When I first bought my AR I got this video with it. It really helped me understand how the AR works. The best part was the ""maintenance"" part of the video. It showed me how to field strip and showed me what to clean how to clean, etc...I enjoyed watching it and learning from Lenny - he is a very good speaker in this video and makes things very clear."
3,Not for Beginners,"This book does not offer any entry point for a beginner. It starts you out memorizing the chromatic scale (a major undertaking, even with a developed ear). I would only recommend this book to someone who has a strong grasp of major and minor intervals and a well developed ear. Can you sing a minor sixth off the top of your head? If not, look elsewhere."
1,Complete CRAP !,"Length:: 1:00 MinsLeft the light on in the safe. Could not find my keys. Called for support, and it's a royal pain to get new keys. Looked at lock picking videos on youtube.Still could not get into it. Turned safe on its side and it opens on it's own.Yea....turn it on it's side, shake a bit and opens right up. WAY TO GO GUYS......That's secure.Wish I knew this sooner so I could return it.Total waste of money."
1,Disappointing,I used this box to store medicine for a visitor who was under my care in my home. When I was away the box was broken open using only household tools.
5,Really good,Got the safe and it does what it's supposed to do. Easy install quality workmanship fits perfect where I wanted it to
3,nice safe but keep you key close.,"This safe is strong and works good for storing my hand gun under my bed,the only complaint I have is the key pad.The pad works about 1 out of 3 times correctly."
1,"no rating possible, but delay too heavy!",Sorry but I'm still awaiting my product and believe me i find it rather annoyingand should this painfully long delays arise again I'd think twice before making purchase through amazon.comI do hope not waiting for too long a timeDR
5,great product,this griddle plate works great. the quality is exactly what i was looking for. keep up the good work!
3,Looks nice but kind of to big,I like the look and style but for me I just think the ball is to big and irritates my mouth. Everything else is great.
2,Very close to worthless . . .,"During my nursing school days I went out and spent a small fortune on care plan books. This one was recommended by the head of the program and I honestly don't know why because I found it to be of little to no use at all. One reviewer hit it on the head . . it's just very limited and not client focused enough for me. Go with any of the Spring House series instead or get Sheila Sparks ""Nursing Diagnosis Reference Manual"""
2,Little or no help,This book offers little or no help for beginning students like me. It's very disorganized and the CD-ROM is even more useless than the book itself.
1,DONT BUY THIS BOOK FOR CARE PLANS,This book is awful! There is no index for easy look up and is incredibly confusing to use. It is not helpful when writing care plans. I bought this book because my nursing program recommended it but it turned out to be a big waste of money. I never even used the books and great on my care plans. PLEASE DONT WASTE MONEY like I had to.
4,Wonderful interweaving of Life's metaphors,"The Forms of Water advances the use of metaphor into an elaborate understanding the states of life. I saw elements of the characters in myself (sometimes unsettlingly so), and I understood the meaning of various forms of water that may seem to some a remote reference, but can also draw one deeper into the significance of the story. I read it straight through, unable to stop."
1,Pointless novel with generic characters,"I can't imagine anyone actually getting through this book. I had the feeling it was going nowhere a third of the way in. Generic characters dressed up to resemble something closer to life, plodding pace, pointless events (many of them spent in fast food places), dreary dialogue. It's supposed to be about a dying ex-monk who wants to go back to his old monastery (now sunk beneath a dammed lake), but why he feels compelled to make the journey, what dying and old age are like, what this man feels or knows, his history, have all eluded this writer who makes do with ""sensitive"" writing. This puts her in the ranks of so many deservedly unread writers of sensibility we seem to be churning out in great numbers. Andrea, my advice is to write only when you have something to say."
3,This is a great cd,"Hey I definately love number 5! It gives the song a good start with one of the singers counting it off! I believe that would be... I think Krystal, I think that is the one! Well like I was saying good job and good luck to you in the near future!"
3,The Writer's Strike Shows,"Medium has been excellent and I was really looking forward to series 4.However the writer's strike seems to have not only shortened the season (only 16 episodes here as opposed to 21 in season 3), but also some of the 'Medium' creativity was missing.A few episodes seemed to have sort of weirdly 'scooby doo' endings. Much weaker than previous seasons.Hopefully season 5 will see a return to the creative and quirky path for Alison. Still worth watching for the best written family and marriage on tv. And they all have lovely hair :)"
1,I feel cheated,"I've been telling friends how great Amazon Prime is, especially how much I enjoyed watching the show Medium for free. When I got to Season 4 and saw there was a charge -- boy was I mad. I feel ripped off! I won't be singing the praises of Prime anymore."
5,Excellent price for excellent product,"I've been a fan of Medium ever since I was given its 1st season as a present. I've been buying all seasons from this website. If you're a lover of the psychic world, paranormal, legal system, etc, then you'll love Medium. Season 4 is slightly shorter than the previous ones, I guess due to the writers'strike, but it's still the BEST! As always, by buying it directly from amazon.com I was sure I'd get it fast, and I actually got my product the next day!!"
5,Can't stop watching,"I love love love this show.Having met the ""real"" Allison Dubois and her husband Joe, makes it even more interesting."
1,Likes Gwendolyn Brooks but this book didn't do it for me,"I like Gwendolyn Brooks. But I like poetry that tells a story more and this book didn't have much of it. My favorite poem was ""Bronzeville Woman in a Red Hat"" because it was more my style of poetry, a hidden story being revealed by every line. I just wasn't feeling the poetry in this book. It seemed a little dry. I love ""We Real Cool"" and classics like that, but I don't feel this book showcased Brooks' ability to tell a story and recite a poem at the same time."
1,Buy a collection of Shakespeare sonnets.,"Ms. Brooks epitomizes what is wrong with modern poetry. Poems like ""We Real Cool"" show an attempt at profundity but fall so far from the mark as to be laughable. The sad fact, however, is that, of Brooks' poems, ""We Real Cool"" seems to be the best example of rhythm and meter I have seen.If you want to buy a book of poetry, save your money and buy something meaningful -- perhaps a book of poetry by Yeats or a collection of Shakespeare sonnets."
3,ok but first one (Celtic Circle) much much better!!,"The cd is okay with the Clannad and Moya Brennan songs but other than these, it comes across as flat and dull. Now, the original Celtic Circle is much more fun and entertaining with Clannad, Moya Brennan, Loreena McKennitt, and Lord of the Rings songs. So if you like celtic music, get that cd along with the LOR soundtracks, Clannad cds and Moya Brennan cds. The latter has a wonderful voice and can sing like a bird on her own even without surrounding music!!"
2,Destination Vegas - Elvis,There really wasn't alot of new material. Most of what there was was grainy and poor quality. There is some new material alot in the audio track. I can really only recommend this to the die hard Elvis fan that wants everything there is on Elvis.
1,Destination Vegas - Elvis,This was a waste of money. It had less than many of the other dvd's that I have purchased. I would not recommend anyone wasting their money to buy this particular dvd.
2,Very disappointed,After me and my Dad worked on this for over an hour we finally were able to play with it. It worked for 2 minutes and quit. We replaced the batteries but it still wouldn't work. My dad worked on all the wiring and still it wouldn't work. The rim also was not staying on when we shot the baskets. We packed it back in the box and took it back to the store. I was really disappointed. I really wanted this for Christmas.
4,Shot Block is a Blast!!!,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my nine year old daughter. She absolutely loves it and continues to play it everyday. Her friends come over and they love it too!!! I highly recommend this gift for all ages, boys and girls!!! My two and three year olds shoot the basketballs, too!!! It is easy to set up and folds behind the door for out-of-the-way storage. No messy pieces. Definately four stars!!!"
2,Rim keeps falling off!,"Just as everyone else stated in previous write-ups, the rim falls off too easily. My son is only 3 and 1/2 years old and he manages to knock the rim down when he shoots at it... that's awful. I wouldn't recommend this toy, it takes about an hour or more to assemble and isn't very durable."
1,Wont survive my boys,"This toy took almost an hour to assemble, and kept breaking almost immediately after we took it out of the box. The hoop kept popping off the backboard everytime we tried to take a shot. We had to stand by while the kids played and keep putting the hoop back on, after it popped off. The instructions state that the hoop is designed to pop off easily in case anyone tried to hang on it, but it wouldn't even stay on for a simple basketball shot. I am dissapointed that a toy this expensive would be so easily broken. I am returning it this week."
2,"The toy is fun, but rim keeps falling off","My son got this for Christmas and was excited to play it, but as soon as he started shooting the rim kept falling off. I am sorry to see that Fisher Price has built a toy with an obvious flaw in it. We were considering getting another to try, but in looking at the reviews it seems to be a common problem so we are returning it. You would think this would have been fixed before it hit the stores as the idea is a good one. What a big disappointement!"
2,Junk,"The concept of this basketball is good, however, I agree with the last reviewer. The hoop keeps coming out and continually needs to be popped back in. The kids don't have patience for this so basically we have a plastic toy dangling from our door.My kids got this for Christmas from Toys R Us... I am going to see if I can return it."
1,Dangerous!,"We bought this toy for our 8 and 5 year old children. This toy does not fit the door properly. It has fallen off the door 3 times since we bought it, each time slamming down on someone. I moved the door slightly and it fell on my hand. I thought I had broken my hand. My hand swelled up and is black and blue. My 5 year old son went over near the goal to pick up the ball and the entire goal fell on him, cutting his hand. We are so happy that it did not hit his head. I would not recommend this basketball goal. It is too heavy not to be mounted to the wall someway."
1,cardboard characters,"I forced myself to finish this book. Like other reviewers have said, the characters are very one-dimensional and contrived. I can see Ms. Berg thinking, ""Let's see, I need a character/patient who is rich, one who lives in the ghetto, how about an elderly Jewish couple...."" etc. etc. If I read one more cliched remark from the character DeWitt I was going to scream!! I doubt I'll read another one of Berg's books. This one won't stay on my shelf for a second read down the road...off it goes to Goodwill."
4,As only Ms. Berg could tell it!,"Elizabeth Berg masterfully creates characters and handles them with exquisite care. With her uncanny ability to make us laugh and cry, we find ourselves doing both throughout this book. Always a quiet loner, at 51 Myra lives quite an isolated yet satisfying enough existence, working as a visiting nurse, with her dog as her only companion. As fate would have it, she finds herself nursing her old classmate Chip, the former heart-throb who is now terminally ill. As she and Chip spend his last days together, they share some very tender moments described with the infinite grace we've come to expect from Ms. Berg. This story is not sad, as the storyline may suggest. . . it is also humorous and heart-warming. . . Elizabeth Berg has not let us down, she keeps getting better and better!!!"
4,"A Refreshing ""Change""","I've read most of Berg's books, and although I typically find them to be a bit treacly, ""Never Change"" really struck me (although it is somewhat cloying and definitely predictable). The descriptions of Myra's lonely life were especially poignant; Berg has made her an extremely sympathetic character, one you are really rooting for. The way the book deals with death was also compelling; maybe it was because I had just been to a funeral the day before, but it really got me thinking about my inevitable demise and the deaths of loved ones. This is not a morbid tale at all, but a bittersweet one."
4,Bittersweet,"This book was recommended to me by a friend recently and I'm very glad. I liked it very much although the melancholy feeling of this story has stayed with me since I finished it a few days ago. The character of Myra is both sad and triumphant. The story of Myra being put in a position to care for the man who was once her school-girl crush but was way out of her league, takes well-known stereotypes and revisits them years later when their lives are at an unexpected crossroads. Once Myra is in a position to care for a very sick Chip, a bittersweet love story begins. I enjoyed this book very much. It's a low-key read, but it sneaks into your thoughts long after you've put it away.Wintertide: A Novel"
3,SPOILER ALERT,"** spoiler alert **Not the best of Berg's work for sure, but an interesting book nonetheless. I'm not in favor of suicide under any circumstances, so I had a problem with Chip choosing to end it that way, but I certainly understood (and agreed) with his declining to pursue further treatment when it was evident that his cancer was terminal. I liked that he chose to live out his final days on his own terms.I could identify to some extent with Myra, having been that wallflower, bookwormish girl throughout school. However, I found her struggle with self confidence a bit off-putting, especially considering the success she has had & the friends she has made throughout her life. She is lonely, but to some extent that is of her own making, and it annoyed me. She seems unable to recognize the fullness of her own life, and that is sad."
3,Not my fave Elizabeth Berg novel,"I just didn't get into this book and had to force myself to finish reading it with the hopes that it would get better. The whole premise of the book was interesting, but I didn't feel the story was well developed."
4,a lovely love story,"this author was new to me and a welcome pleasure, i might add. the book was an easy read and elizabeth berg's characters were likeable. the story reminds me of carly simon's song about friends from college having gotten married and having their houses and their lives... i can imagine 51 year old myra blaring that song on the radio. but finally a point goes to the underdog!"
4,very sad,if you like sad- this is the book for you. it really made me appreciate my husband and be thankful for what i do have.
4,True Nursing,"I, too, am a registered nurse, and the same age as Myra, the main character. Like the author, I have not practiced nursing for some time; also, I have cared for ill family members and have cancer myself---so perhaps I have the advantage of a long and wide perspective. In my opinion, Myra represents nursing at its finest, its truest, its most honest.Please remember that this is a novel, not a nursing manual. The author writes truths of the heart and soul--of people, some of whom happen to be nurses."
4,"Charming - reminds me of Ann Tyler's ""Patchwork Planet""","Very charming in its simplicity of style, its minimalism, its amusing array of characters. It reminded me of Ann Tyler's ""Patchwork Planet,"" in which sweet, selfless characters do chores for elderly people and like them desite their complaints and annoying ways.Also, I thought the nurse was a believable, lonely woman who had never been fulfilled romantically, but who had accepted her lot in life and, finally, having done so, finds herself meeting the man of her dreams - literally - the most popular boy in her high school on whom she once had a huge crush.The book has a poetic momentum, and the author has a loose, easy style that makes it easy to take...even though it is about terminal illness."
2,sappy and not credible,I really hate stories that hook the part of me that cries over sentimental muck. Which is exactly what this novel did.There are little descriptive gems throughout Berg's writing (an extra star for that) but the characters in this story were mostly cliches--one-dimensional and an insult to intelligent readers.
1,Come on!,"Although it was completely unbelievable that a nurse would bring one patient to visit others or that she'd divulge personal information to them all, the most unbelievable part was how our intelligent, accepting Myra would still be in love with an old high school crush. Come on, she's a grown woman! Elizabeth Berg is a talented writer. Too bad the plot was uninspired."
2,a summer book,Easy reading - A fairy story - sad one but no one can believe it.The ugly duck - the nurse - looks after her dream boy dying from cancer -and then he more or less dies in her arms in her own home.Just a summer book.
3,"I'm a fan of Berg's, but...","I just finished reading this book, and though I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berg, this particular book just didn't take hold of me. It felt she rushed through some parts that were important -- parts that needed to be explored more deeply. I found it lacking a certain something, especially the end. There were many areas that were glossed over, and the characters weren't as real and well developed as in Berg's other works. However, the storyline did have some nice tension that kept me turning pages."
2,Disappointed Reader,"I enjoyed the first 2/3 of this book as Elizabeth Berg has good character development. But then it became a bit weird. I was disappointed in the last 1/3 when it lost the train of thought from the first section. This is the second Elizabeth Berg book I've read this summer and I expected more from her, based on other reviews and reputation. Thus, I'm disappointed.Part of my disappointment could be that I just finished an exceptional book, ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society"" about a week ago. It was a tough act for Elizabeth Berg to follow."
2,Too many good books out there to waste time reading this!,"Not at all memorable. Formulaic in that Oprah's Book Club sort of way...martyr-like female who is a ""better"" person at the end of the book having learned a valuable lesson about life, love, the world or all three. Yawn, yawn, yawn...there are too many good books in the world to waste your time reading this."
4,Makes you appreciate your life,"What a beautiful book, so ""readable"" - the characters truly seemed like real people to me. I couldn't wait to get back to my book (had to tend to my kids) to see what happens to Myra. What real, human feelings she has. This book also shows how everyone can be different, yet each has good in them. I hugged my kids and am adoring my own life even more after I finished this book. I read it in 2 days and I'm so happy to be alive and have my own wonderful family. Please read this ... p.s. Oprah fans, you will really love this."
5,Beyond the High School Yearbook,"This is an engaging, touching and lovingly-written novel that draws us into a circle of real people facing real (and in some cases, devastating) problems. As a baby boomer, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could relate many of the characters to people I knew in high school. I'm also an author, of NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL, and I appreciate good writing. This is one high school ""reunion"" you shouldn't miss."
2,Berg's done better,"A quick, easy, mindless read. I enjoyed the protagonist in this novel.A single woman with a career as a home health-care nurse. I found several characters to be simply unbelievable. Such as Dewitt and Chip Reardon, whom Myra loves, dying from a brain tumor. The ending didn't do much for the novel either and at that point I simply didn't care!"
1,Never Change,"I have thoroughly enjoyed most of Elizabeth Berg's books - up until now with the exception of 'Pull of the Moon' (not her best). After reading 'Never Change' I am reticent to try another!!! How can an author write such wonderful books such as 'Durable Goods'(I loved it) and 'Range of Motion'(great) and believe that 'Never Change' is quality writing in any fashion. Elizabeth, I don't think it's 'written true'. Doris"
1,A shame to the nursing profession among other things!!,"I think I may be the only reviewer who did not care for this book. I found it unrealistic and unprofessional. A nurse should not be doing the things she is doing in this novel. Also, the ""ugly duckling"" syndrome carrying over later in life theme is something I cannot stand reading about, where someone never feels like they are pretty or worth anything. This is something that the main character, Myra, suffers from. What a way to make a reader feel bad!! I feel sorry for Elizabeth Berg if she actually felt this way in her life. But to give a character in a novel these traits is inexcusable. It just reinforces the idea amongst other vulnerable people/readers that if you were quiet when you were young then you are ugly. AND THIS IS NOT TRUE!Overall, sappy & unrealistic."
5,an advanced soul,"I can hardly see what I am writing as my eyes are brimming with tears. I have just finished reading ""Never change"" and had to get this review in. Elizabeth Berg must be a remarkable woman indeed to write with such compassion and heart. This is a book that will stay with me for a long time. Now I think I will go and watch my children sleeping, and thank God for the gift of a healthy family. Bless you, Elizabeth."
4,Contrived and saccharine - I liked it anyhow!,"The set up is completely unbelievable - a 51-year old guy with the ridiculous name of Chip, comes home to die and Myra, a girl who had a crush on him in high school, just happens to be his visiting nurse. Big surprise - they fall in love despite his being a dream boat and her a dog.What saves this from being a maudlin piece is Berg's ability to make her characters real. Even though I didn't believe the plot for a minute, I believed that the characters were real people. Berg's attention to detail is excellent. Her character's voices and observations, and what they say to one another are true. That's why I truly enjoyed this book.But I won't give Berg a five. Recently I heard a story of hers read aloud. It had all the positive points of this book, but it was sophisticated, funny and deep. I want her to write a book with more depth. She can do it. She has plenty of cash now from the sale of all these sappy books. Come on, Liz. Give us a piece of literature."
2,Never Change,"I have been a big fan of Elizabeth Berg and have read all of her books. This one is the first to disappoint me. I am a nurse and took great offense at some of the things that Myra did in the story. It would be highly unprofessional to take one patient to visit another and unethical to discuss the details of a patient with another one. The whole scenario was completely unbelievable to me. I hope that the readers would not think that this would really happen if they should ever need a visiting nurse. I hope the author. who according to the book jacket was a nurse, never acted like this in her professional role."
2,Sterling silver ?,"I did not like the quality/style of the earrings, nor the packaging it came in. Plus, I did not get any resolution from the company when I complained way before this and another review were posted."
3,Gershom FLAGG Genealogy,"If you are tracing the whole Flagg family or especially the branch that moved to Lancaster MA and to western states, it is a good addition to your library."
3,Uncertain as to its accuracy,"I am reading this book while visiting Kauai. It is an easy read, and seemingly informative and well researched. I worry though, because I found a glaring error in the very first chapter. While describing the remarkable distances the Polynesians traveled, it states that Westerners of the same period could not sail beyond site of land (page 17). It does no dishonor to the Polynesians to acknowledge that Westerners sailed beyond site of land from time immemorial. (The island of Crete is almost 200 miles from the nearest large island, and maintained a magnificent civilization before 1000 BC. Phoenicians, Greeks, Celts, and others all sailed beyond the sight of land.) Casually making such a ludicrous error so early in the book casts doubt on the facts about Kauai itself. I can only hope that the ""facts"" presented about Kauai itself, are actually true."
1,Harder than being an astronaut,"The book is really difficult to follow, confusing, has plenty of boring stuff and is impossible to follow. If you're a serious student and don't want cute school books for having fun (which in this case you wont), stick with Thurneysen or keep looking. Old Irish is hard and this book makes it look even harder. I returned it."
1,Sent it Back.,"Mine showed up broken.It seems that a single ""string"" on a pulley is what is used to raise and lower the umbrella via the crank. The string in mine was broken off (not connected) and inside the main pole. Not a great design for lasting a long time in any kind of weather.I'll try another brand."
2,Strathwood umbrella,Umbrella looks nice but is flimsy in the wind. Part of that is due to the hinge (nice feature when sun is low in the sky) and a pole that should be be more solid...maybe wood as opposed to hollow metal tubing. Biggest issue is that there are no vents in the umbrella so it becomes very unstable when the weather is even slightly windy....we just can't relax thinking it may snap and go flying off the patio and down to the street!
2,Not as advertised,"First, this is NOT a ""writing"" desk. It is a COMPUTER desk. The ""drawer"" is a keyboard tray, which is what I did NOT want. I have put together furniture before so I already had a good idea that the ""easy assembly"" was a lie. The directions are NOT user friendly. If you have never put together something like this before, have someone else do it. The directions vs the pictures were confusing. It looks real pretty but the ""drawer"" is unuseable. The tracks are too far apart for the keyboard drawer to work properly and the screws are too short. the tracks have already fallen off due to the screws not holding it in. It is useless. The wood is cheap processes lamant. The top slipped in my hands and banged against the dresser. A 3x2 piece of the top split off. This ""writing desk"" cost a total of $185. Save your money, not worth it."
1,Pass up this product unless you love puzzels.,"Just received this product and spent over four hours trying to assemble. Directions are confusing with poor illustrations or nothing at all about several key elements. The desk is disassembled and requires two people to even begin assembly. The last straw was the drawer sliders which had no explanations and took extra hour to properly mount. This product had minimal functional hardware. Most pieces were venier press wood and would not hold a screw if you had to attach it a second time. The last irritant is a return policy that holds you responsible to repackage in an as shipped condition(original packing materials). They do not refund an excessive $64.00 original ship charge. You may want to carefully review any of these ""easy"" assemble asian furniture items..."
4,It's nice,The desk is great for a small space but assembling it takes a bit of time. The surface of the desk also scratches easily which is a thing to becareful about.
4,Mickey was a truly adventurous sort,"To those who only know Mickey Mouse as the cute little character from cartoons,this is an eye-opener.He has many adventures with Minnie, Horace,Dippy(later Goofy),and Donald.Pegleg Pete is a real criminal,involved with gangsters and Communists.Mickey assumes responsibility,shows ingenuity and emerges as a true hero.It's too bad that the,""Walt Disney,""signature kept the work of Floyd Gottfredson,Ted Osbourne or Merril DeMerris shrouded in secrecy until the late 60s-but now a whole new generation of readers can see another side to Mickey Mouse-and understand more about his popularity during the 30s."
2,Not as good as Vanessa Mae and Born,"I bought this expecting it to be similar to Vanessa Mae and Born's more upbeat works (as it was advertised in a commentary on CNN). I was disappointed. It is slow and it was hard to tell that their Doors cover is Riders On The Storm. Definitely get Vanessa Mae's The Violin Player, or Born's Bond or Shine instead."
2,Not good,"Still not very good. I rarely listen to any of the songs here. I think any Posies fan who really likes this album just couldn't wait for anything new from the Posies....like someone dying of thirst. I just listened to it one last time hoping I missed something after puchasing the new Blood/Candy. It gets worse each time. Only song I like is ""Conversations"". Very disjointed album. ""Could He Treat you Better"" might be the worst song they've ever done. The 2nd half of the album is almost unlistenable. I can't believe this is the way I feel as I have every album from the Posies including Jon and Ken's solo efforts. I hope the magic comes back. PS: go pick up Jon's ""Songs From the Year of Our Demise"". It is fantastic."
2,What a bummer...,"I've been looking forward to this album for quite some time, and man, what a bummer that this is what I've been waiting for. After several listens, I still can't find even one song worth putting on a mix cd. Come on, guys, you can do better than this!"
3,"Good songs, irritating singer","The Stereophonics are back with the same type of catchy songs as the first album, but GEEZ the singer's voice is grating after a few songs. Get a new singer, boys. Cheers"
2,"A 35 year old's idea of what ""the kids"" like","The Stereophonics are back, but this time they seem to have had every novel idea sucked out of them. Avoid this album like the plague, unless you like cliche ridden, sing-along rock. Horrible!"
4,Second album from Welsh trio with even better songs,"A follow up to the debut, 'Word Gets Around', Performance and Cocktails is a great album full of catchy guitar riffs, witty lyrics, brilliant drumming and bass guitar playing and superb vocals. Stereophonics second album sees them continuing with the theme of life in Cwmaman, their small hometown in Wales. Songs like 'Roll Up And Shine' and 'Just Looking' are catchy and full of electric guitars. Quieter, acoustic songs are more frequent on this album than the first, notable ones being 'Hurry Up And Wait' and 'I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio'. This album is one of the best indie albums of 1999, and I reccomend it to anyone."
3,Nothing in particular,"I don't listen to this album very often, because it's about an average album, with only a few good songs on it. The standouts are tracks 1,2 and 7, but the singing is awful."
3,Let's R-O-C-K!,"Heads down, thumbs up everyone, The Stereophonics are back in town and this follow-up to the promising Word Gets Around is positively BIG WIDESCREEN driving pop-rock. And that's exactly why it grates so easily. This is very by-the-numbers stuff, there's so much more inspiring stuff out there that listening to the vapid likes of Bartender and the Thief, Pick A Part That's New, Hurry Up and Wait, I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio etc. etc. makes you want to turn off and put some Manics or REM on. That said, it's quite likeable in the short-term, and there are some good songs lurking. Just Looking is Stereophonics prefection, like T'Pau meets Radiohead and T-Shirt Suntan is the catchiest thing they've done yet. But on the whole this is a very disappointing, front page NME/Melody Maker album to be filed alongside Travis' The Man Who in the folder marked O for ordinary."
2,The vocals ruin this record!,"This would have been a much better record if the lead vocalist didn't sing as if he got shot through the throat a couple of times. What's up with that? There is a lot to be said for passionate vocals, but this is overdoing it. Do we really need another Rod Stewart? Also, the songs are a bit dull, too."
1,Rod Stewart in a Welsh Accent,"Haing decided to stoically, 'keep their charisma a closely guarded secret,' Stereophonics have emerged for a second time with second-rate tunes. These have so far only managed to rival Travis in their banality and this reviewer recommends if you find personality at all endearing, you try never to meet any of the Stereophonics or listen to them ever. The tunes are reminiscent of sawing part of your skull off and only irritatingly not painfully tapping on the exposed grey matter."
1,Boring outdated rubbish,"Everything about these derivative pub-rockers sucks. Their slow songs are plodding and empty, and Kelly Jones' voice is horrendous. A Minute Longer, which no-one on here seems to like, is the most dull and listless piece of tripe I've ever heard. Just Looking and Is Yesterday Tomorrow Today? are at least as bad. The rock songs are also pale compared to so many other groups including the ones they model themselves on (Live, Black Crowes etc), Bartender and the Thief in particular really is nothing new. The only 2 songs here I even vaguely like are Pick a Part That's New and T-Shirt Suntan, those two are quite sprightly and pleasant. And as a tip for the future- don't try and go all arty on us with piano lead tracks like the album closer. It doesn't make you appear sophistocated or talented, just emphasises how vacuous this record is. No wonder even tourign with Live in the US has only resulted in 30,000 sales there."
2,hit and miss...mostly miss,"if you can get past the grating voice of the lead singer, you might find this album mildly enjoyable. The record is very schizophrenic and doesn't really put a stamp on what it's trying to do. The band is at their best when they ease off the pedal and put some rythum into their music. There are three great songs on this album - Hurry Up and Wait, A Minute Longer and I Stopped to Fill My Car Up - that exemplify the band's strength. But anytime they try and reach beyond their capabilities, the music falls apart. Having said that, the 3 great songs, along with 4 or 5 more decent ones, are worth the money. It's not the greatest album in the world, but it's not bad."
4,Another good CD from the Sterephonics,"I enjoyed this CD quite well. There were some songs on it that I liked better than others (e.g. the first three tracks were awesome) and there were others that I just didn't like. For example, during ""A Minute Longer"" I found myself thinking ""Could this song possibly last a minute longer??"" I did like about half of the tracks, and the ones I don't like I just skip over. I'm giving this CD 4 stars, because it was another great CD by a great band, as long as you ignore those boring little songs."
3,"it's okay, but what's the big deal?","It's good, but I just didn't find this album very original. It's okay for what it is, some basic rock and roll, but after the first three tracks all the songs sound the same."
4,American Perspective,"Grunge is just a memory now as the American masses go after Kid Rock. But bands like Stereophonics have been doing the great old punk/metal thing for a few years, and this new record was actually up for this year's Mercury Prize. Songs like ""The Bartender and The Thief"" and ""T-shirt Sun Tan"" are classic songs to get excited about. Also they are big on ballads, that show a softer side to the power trio from Wales. I saw them recently live, and they are entertaining, with singer Kelly Jones' head to the side approach, and the drummer Stuart Cable had as much energy as Keith Moon. Finally here's a band who can take the mantel from Oasis and Nirvana. A record for those who want to rock out!(www.freewilliamsburg.com)"
5,Absolutely brilliant!,This album features some very good tracks! It is a worhty successor to the last album 'Word Gets Around'. The talented three have really set a new standard with this one!!!
3,This album serves its purpose of filling the gap between...,"the releases of proper artists such as Radiohead. What I mean is that Stereophonics is part of a group of bands which make decent albums and allow the time between great albums pass by a little faster faster. They have their great poppy, guitar driven rock tunes with a tinge of punk such as the opener to ""Performance and Cocktails:"" ""Roll up and Shine."" but then there are their attempts to make thoughtful slow songs, whose lyrics are boring and kinda lame. Kelly Jones' writing and the make-up of the band is more condusive to their big ""arena rockers"" which they do quite well (e.g. ""bartender and thief,"" ""roll up and shine,"" and ""pick a part that's new."") and not ballads. But who can really complain, they did their job didn't they?"
1,this record is bad news,"This record is at best pub rock and at worst your mates school band. The songs themselves are banal, some quiet bits - some loud bits; but never interesting and nothing that other horrific bands haven't done already, like 'The Alarm'. This music is strictly for those who like their music predictable. Have recently made the mistake of recording with Tom Jones, horribly misjudged as cool (in an ironic sort of way) in some quarters and hilariously awarded a ""Brit"" award for being the UKs best male artist. This album is another example of the ""dumbing down on Britain"". Absolutely revolting."
2,Dean Martin Lost Concert Series?,Dean Martin Lost Concert Series? This is very mis-leading. What this DVD is about: selected clips from the Martin and Lewis TV shows of the 50's in B&*W and some clips have poor sound quality. There are no clips of Dean Martin singing on his own TV show in the 60's into the mid 70's. Martin by then had matured into a more sophisticated singer with a better delivery without loosing and of the tonal quality that he had in his 30's when he was partnered up with Jerry Lewis. You can get most of the songs Martin sings on this DVD by getting any of the DVD sets that are offered about the Martin & Lewis TV series.P. Ross
4,Lost Concert Review,Was happy with product as quality was not too bad considering that the original concerts were many many years ago
5,excellent item,This is an excellent buy. The tarps are good quality and well made. Money well spent.
3,Nice tarp but not as thick as its claimed to be.,This is a cool looking tarp but it's not as thick as its claimed to be. I think it will rip sooner than later. It's been a month since I've had it. There are a few marks on it that will weaken it. It will also depend what you will be using it for. If you are looking for a tarp that you can put down and not move it much then this your tarp.
5,Fun & Lively!,"We used this tape, and several others by Karyn Henley, in our Christian child care centre. The children picked up the songs quickly and loved each one. They would often join in on the videos too. An excellent resource for anyone with little children who are lively. EXCELLENT!"
5,If you've holidayed at the British coast read this!,"Connolly disects the British class system with a hilarious examination of snobbery, greed and jealousy wrapped into a farcial summer holiday. This is laugh out loud funny made all the better because I read it on a beach in Tahitit - about as far removed from the British coastal holiday described in the book as you can get."
3,amusing light entertainment,"This is quite fun as a humorous novel; not as annoying as Tom Sharpe, who often tries too hard to be ""dark and ironic,"" and not especially well written, but decent light reading. (As usual with British comic novels, the scenes set in the U.S. show a lack of anything but a very superficial familiarity with things American.)"
2,Entertaining but bad,"If you like - really like - farce, this is the book for you. If you just tolerate it, it's an ok pastime (but you'd better not pay it full price, if you ask me.) If you're looking for a book which is funny, subtle and smart though, look elsewhere. Connolly aspires to make sharp satire but by depicting all characters like sex/money/stuff-obsessed morons, he's just flat and unoriginal."
2,NOT good gift presentation!,"I haven't watched the DVD --it's a gift-- but I was disappointed when I got it, since it's not in a DVD case...just in a CD-sized cardboard sleeve. NOT an elegant presentation, especially for the price! I'm not planning to return it, since I know the recipient will be interested in the content, but I was disappointed that the visual of the product does not accurately represent the actual item."
2,very thin,i recieved my flag in a timely manner .But was not happy with the quality for the price. it is thin and doesn't look like it can hold up more than one season outdoors.another person said they got 2 flags for the price of one when they order this flag.i did not get a Eagles flag with mine .Just the Phillies. I will be returning mine for a refund and will be ordering a different one.
4,Not bad for the money,Not a bad deal. Came packaged with a Eagles flag.Perchased 2one for one for bussiness. Wish they were a little larger in size
5,Blowfly will *never* go out of style.,"After the amazing Blowfly gig at Bottom of the Hill in SF (best gig I've seen all year!), I bought the cd - and I can't stop listening to it.Blowfly for president!"
5,very funny,ignore the haterade - Fahrenheit 69 is very funny and is easily Blowfly's best in 20 years.
1,Smoking Crack?,"This album was a big dissapointment. I don't know where Blowfly found this new band, but it sounds like a parody on the sterotypical 70's sound. The only decent song on the album is ""You've got your di-k on backwards"", the rest of the album is a bunch of filler and just not funny. Stick to the classic Blowfly and Clarence Reid material. The new Punk Rock album from Blowfly may be worst!"
1,stick to the old stuff,"Stay away from this CD if you like the old Blowfly. These days, the new Blowfly a dorky drummer, who just won't shut up on the CD. Blowfly was funnier, when he was Blowfly. Now we have this dork who is desperate for the spotlight. Buy the old stuff."
4,Theres a killer on the road...,"This book is fictional guys so don't be fooled by the cover.However, it is a good book and a mad story (Another Day In Paradise by a guy called Eddie Little is quite similar) and well worth the read.I loved the character Tamara.You pays your money you take your choice."
4,fast and intense,"A non-traditional book in a hight tempo. It showes an other side of the Jim Morrison most people know. The story takes place in the time before Jim was into the musicbusiness, and more into poetry (and his theatrical thoughts). It gives you an idea of the dramatical way of living he loved. (After all, we only have an image of who he was, but who was he for real?)Easy reading, once you pick it up, you can't stop"
1,Fageddaboutit,"A total waste of money. Don't buy this pulp. If you're into Jim Morrison, read one of the factual books about him and the Doors."
1,oh puhleeeeze,"I'm sure that by using Jim Morrison as one of the main characters helped to boost the sales of this piece of tacky pulp fiction more than just a little.I feel sorry for the reviewer who actually thought that it was a true story.There are so many good factual books out there about Jim, or the 60's.Spend your hard earned dosh on one of those instead."
2,Maybe I'm missing something but ...,"I'm certainly not claiming to be an expert in this field but there is no discussion of volemia in the entire text. Granted, this may be described in the text as intravascular ECF but in clinical practice the terms natremia, volemia, tonicity, and osmolarity/osmolality are used together to describe the ""fluid"" status of patients. So, a student could read this text but still be lost on rounds or in discussions on the topic.The text also strongly recommends giving hypertonic saline to any patient with a sodium level of < 130 ""even if there are no symptoms"". It defends this by stating the benefits but doesn't discuss the risks or the need for central line placement. From my experience this is way outside usual and customary practice and can be dangerous.""Acid-base, fluids, and electrolytes made ridiculously simple"" is a much better text which includes many questions at the end of each chapter that really helped my understanding and is a great place to start."
5,Good Gospel Message with Humour,This was sooo funny and also had a good Gospel message. I have watched this about 5 or 6 times now.. excellent. Also have shared it a few times as well.
4,Will buy more!,He has always been one of my favorites. I enjoy his sense of humor and his voice. Glad he is back with the group.
4,Excellent advice!,"If we are able to master negotiating techniques our salary, relationships, and the prices we pay for everything change. I only wish this book were longer!"
2,A long shot from Rocky and Shock.,"I've been a fan of Rocky Horror for many, many years now and recently purchased Shock Treatment, which I was totally captivated by. I love Richard's way of mixing 50's and 60's rock with that of the 70's and 80's. He is a wonderful lyricist and song writer and I'm very impressed with his work, in general.I bought this CD hoping to find more of his music, similar in style to that of Rocky and Shock Treatment. I was disappointed with this CD mainly in the fact that the songs are all jazzy, lounge sounding songs. No electric guitars or catchy, fun choruses. There doesn't seem to be the same angst and fire that was in his other works. They seemed very mellow and tame, not cutting edge, rebelious, and memorable.He does show his singing talent in this CD. If you are looking for music similar to his earlier works I wouldn't look here. If you want to see another dimension of Richard then this CD is worth a look."
5,Husband pleased,"My husband is very pleased with this mute.After years away from formally practicing and playing the trombone, my husband has diligently returning to the joy of playing during his retirement. Your mutes are of the quality he needs and he is thrilled with each one.So this is just one more in the collection he is building this year"
3,Father homeschools daughter for a year,"I found this book to be a quick and easy read. Riley's sense of humor make the book enjoyable to read, yet it is not lightweight material. Perhaps the best part of Riley's book is the honest re-telling of what happens when you homeschool. Many homeschooling books paint homeschooling in such a glorious light, that the real life nuts and bolts of homeschooling gets swept under the rug. Homeschooling can be difficult and exhausting. Is it worth it? For some people, yes. Dan Riley captures the gritty, one on one nature that makes homeschooling a viable alternative for some families."
5,Solid assortment,"First off, this Prepared Pantry collection is packaged expertly and came in perfect condition after being shipped. The instructions and portions were all arranged neatly so that preparation was easy. Most importantly, of course, the breads tasted delicious. My favorite was the cranberry nut concoction, which is absolutely brilliant. The others are solid, but the cranberry bread takes the cake.If you're interested in a tasty use of it, slice it up and make some cranberry brie grilled cheese sandwiches. You'll thank me later."
2,Poor Quality - High Price,"I bought two of these and both dishes and lids have imperfections (wrinkles and glass indentations). Due to the fact that all four pieces had imperfections, I would not consider this an isolated event. It's not worth it to pay shipping to return them so I'll keep them and use them for basic needs, but I will not use them for any food items to present meals at dinner parties or the like as they are unsightly. I won't be purchasing from this company again."
2,Not for me.....,"Ill keep it brief.First disc: The track selection is mediocre, granted there are a few gems in the bunch, but overall the tracks are uninspiring and dull. The mixing is just weird and the vibe gets lost every time a track switches, the whole album feels very disconnected. I would only recommend this if you love house music poorly mixed with other random genres that sound bad together.Second Disc: Just unmixed versions of the Disc 1 tracks, with some additional remixes."
3,Sequel-ville,"This book is interesting, but generates a different 'feel' to the first book - Land Behind the World. The people and country are more 'human', and I found it a bit too moralising and blatantly New Agey for my tastes. I still enjoyed it very much, but I just didn't find it as magical as the first book."
1,Hmmm...how do you spell drivell...drivele...drivelle...drivel...,"I have to agree with Mr. Musella on this one, my oh my! I, too, started listening to this and never even finished it. Talk about a giant borefest. My copy should have stayed in Belgium where it came from. Hopefully it melted in the house fire where I lived; it must have since I haven`t come across it. Good....whew! (Conversely, Young`s ""Well tuned Piano""--especially on the DVD version--is an extraordinary event.) Just Stompin` reminds me of a Bang on a Can concert I saw where Terry Riley was featured; Riley`s piece (with numerous drug references), which took up the second half, became total unadulterated tedium and I darn near got up to leave early. I could sense the whole audience getting listless and upon the work`s conclusion there was a smattering of tepid applause at best and people split from their seats before the musicians even left the stage. So save your shekels on Just Stompin`unless you buy it as some sort of investment."
4,Stompin the blues (to death),"This is minimalist blues by a guy noted for playing for hours.Slow 15 minute prelude, then he stomps on it hard for another coupla hours.Incredible amount of notes out of that piano. It grooves. Very avant."
2,Warren buffet Woodstock for capitalists,"This DVD gives average information from about the Berkshire hathaway annual meeting from an attendies point of view. However it seemed quite unprofessional, more like a home movie. Was disappointed especially regarding the price. I would pay perhaps $20 for the DVD."
3,New age Chapman,"After making some very interesting albums in the 70s, notably Fully Qualified Survivor and Millstone Grit, Chapman disappeared for a while from the music scene, due to bad health. In the 90s, this exceptional guitar player and songwriter reappeared with several good (try Navigation) and some not-so-very-good albums. You might consider Heartbeat an interim-album, which certainly won't please every fan of his albums from the seventies. It's entirely instrumental and you could call it ""new age"", and as such it is a bit too much background music for me. It's definitely Michael's guitar playing, but fans of his earlier work should listen to it before they buy. You might have to try hard, but his first album, Rainmaker, and the second, Fully Qualified Survivor (his best) have been re-issued on cd. Wonder if Window, Wrecked Again, Millstone Grit and Savage Amusement will be someday - maybe if lots of people are going to buy this one?"
3,Radical Feminism Gone Amok,"Fascinating story line, well-drawn characters, loose threads galore, but Elliott's too obvious hate for males ruins her effort."
2,"OK, but not good","I am a scientist and usually very good at decoding complex texts, but this series is beyond my abilities. I just can't keep up with who all these many, many characters are and how they interact with whom. As a result, I have found the best way to read these books-just pick a story line (I picked Stronghand and the Eika) and skip everything except text pertaining to that storyline. Otherwise, the plot (if there is a central one, which I doubt)just sprawls and spreads, much like a coffee stain on a paper towel. In fact, I would have given this book (and the series) one star if it weren't for the originality of the Eika. Ms. Elliott deserves two stars for that."
2,"OK, mid-level fantasy","This was not worth the wait. I say that even though I enjoyed most of the other books in the Crown of Stars series, but this one is harder to like for some reason. I think Ms. Elliot is a fine author, but a weak and inconsistent one, not up with the likes of the big name female fantasists like Melanie Rawn, Elizabeth Hayden and Robin Hobb.Having said that, however, it was nice to see something in the series out again, especially since Melanie Rawn seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. And this book has already been spammed by the Robert Stanek [or as my friends and I refer to him, Robert Stank] e-publicity machine, which means they think it is a good enough book to ride the coattails of.It's not that bad, respectable for middle of the road stuff. I am still waiting for the Golden Key books."
1,Help I'm drowning,"Well, here goes. Kates previous books were interesting and I could see this being a series as big as Jordans ""Wheel of Time"" But it seems that she has decided to try (unsuccesfully) to gather all the loose ends in this story so that she can have a finale in the next book. There is so much information in this book it was very hard to keep afloat. Sorry but this was a sad and lackluster book, hard to read and digest."
5,Amazing!! I could not put it down!!,"Kate Elliott has to be one of the best authors of our time. Her characters all connected in ways that you did not imagine. Liath, willing to sacrifice herself to save the world. Sanglant willing to sacrifice himself to save his father. Stronghands struggle to save his blood brother Alain. The bond that connects each of them together as they race against time to prevent the great cataclysm that could destroy them or save them. I could just not pull my eyes from the book. I was hooked from page 1. THIS IS A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good series, long book, story loses momentum.","While I loved the first books in this series, as it continues and gets longer and more complex, the story loses me. Normally I follow and enjoy fantasies with a complex and rich history, like George RR Martin's song of ice and fire series, or Melanie Rawn's sunrunner series(I forget what it is called), but I find myself putting down 'The gathering storm' again and again, and forcing myself to read it. I do follow it, but I don't seem to want to. Hopefully as the story reaches it's climax in the last book, the story will gain steam and be interesting again."
3,"too much gathering, not enough storm","Okay, I've been with these characters for nearly 2000 pages now.. and this book does not satisfy, the small moments are incredibly over written and the powerful moments are mysteriously underwritten, so we've been waiting and waiting for this storm, and it just kind of happens, everyone shrugs and moves on. Time passes in weird clumps, and there are just too many threads. I'm losing patience with this series. I've invested so much time in it, it seems that I have to continue, but this book, while having interesting moments, was inherently disappointing and the climax took much too long to get to, and then was over far too quickly."
1,Whoa! Watch Out! Crazy Gangster Rappers!,"Curtis was right! These are no regular hippie congo-tappers, these are some dangerous G's! Listen to the audio, they're Hard, Yo! Too hard for me, dun. 1 stiznar."
4,Ray Anderson's style is so unique and emotional you can feel the music,"This album has come in and out of my life at different moments when it just seems like the perfect theme. It's just as welcome in the back ground of a party as it is just kicking back by yourself. Each song is different, from heart felt jazz/blues of the first song to a carribean feel and even the beautiful standard at the end makes a well crafted and long lasting experience. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because at times the guitar can be somewhat out of place intentionally and on one song particularly the choppy style could have been toned down to keep the cool flow of the album."
3,Doesn't hold up,"Had to send broken unit once for $75 or so and is now broken again. Would not accept for warranty because it was purchased from another source besides Beltronics. When it worked, it worked fine with long distance warnings except on a hill and except for laser which was expected."
1,"Nice lights, doesn't work","It worked fine for about eight weeks, then quit. I didn't keep the receipt, so it was a total waste of money."
5,Can't get enough of books like this!,"The book I read before this one was Rosalind McKnight's Soul Journeys which I loved. Imagine my surprise when I picked up Paul Elder's book, Eyes of an Angel, and found myself right back at The Monroe Institute for more Astral Travel! I feel that I learned a lot from this book and it really piqued my interest about Out of Body Experiences, etc. Paul Elder is very honest with his account and I was surprised when he kept admitting his skepticism. He literally had to be hit over the head with proof!!"
5,Most Excellent Read,"I purchased this book years ago and I can't even remember why. It sat on my shelf and was never opened until recently. Amazing how that happens. Perhaps I was ready to read it and be able to absorb everything between it's covers. Regardless, this book was the most thought provoking book I have ever read. It has changed my perception of life and why we are really here and what awaits us on The Other Side. I have not had any near death experiences, nor do I think it is something required in order to grasp the depth of information in this book. It is for the curious at heart. The ones who yearn for greater knowledge. What is in this book makes perfect sense. Why would God judge us? He is only pure love. We shall judge ourselves and THIS makes perfect sense."
2,"Eyes Of An Angel: Soul Travel, Spirit Guides, Soul Mates, and the Reality of Love","I agree with other reviews. There are better books out there on the subject of NDEs and being on the other side in general. It does focus way too much on the Monroe Institute. There just isn't enough information to make it worth buying the book. If you want to read it, go to your local library."
3,entertaining but not the best of its genre......,"with the large quantity of ""new-age"" and spiritual information now available,both written and recorded, this entry is mediocre. there is a fascinating world out there and if you are new to this understanding then this can be an introduction to what exists beyond your perceived reality. being an avid reader and a dedicated explorer of higher consciousness,this book fell short of my expectations...."
3,Not as good as PerioBrite mouthwash.,"I was expecting more from this toothpaste since I love Perio Brite mouthwash because I have gum issues. This toothpaste did little to help, didn't foam and was pricey."
3,Way Too Hot,"Nice toothpaste except it is way too hot. Not everyone is in love with blazing hot mint toothpaste. I love the ingredients and the idea behind this toothpaste. I just wish it were not so hot that it burns your mouth, especially after eating spices."
3,Nice but somewhat small,This lasagna dish is fairly small. It is just a tad short in length but definitely narrower than most similar baking dishes. Not porcelain like other Nikko pieces; it is a heavy stoneware piece.
3,OLDER WAS BETTER,"I'm on my second cart. My first was stolen in a parking lot where I stupidly left it for 5 minutes. I'm a working musician and cannot go to a gig without my cart as I have alot of heavy stuff to move from car to stage. I replaced my #1 with another R-10, but 8 months later, the front casters fell apart. The quality on the newer R-10's is not as good. The main rear wheels are now plastic instead of metal. The front casters are plastic as well, but the worst part is the way the casters are assembled. Instead of using a bolt to connect the stem to the axle truck, they use a ""cauliflower"" fastener; the end of the stem is machine pounded to flare out and hold the swivel plate. After repeated use, the stem flares begin to weaken and fold in, the plate gets loose, and the ball bearings fall out. I just replaced my front casters with 5"" rubber ones made by MAppCaster; $8 apiece."
1,Poorly manufactured,"I had the previous version of this cart (also stolen). I was very happy with it. I ordered the same model cart as a replacement. Something changed at Rock N Roller. The new cart is very poorly made. I've only had it for months. It arrived with a bad tire. The uprights collapse when you push the cart. The plastic wing nuts used to lock the cart in position broke in the first week, so if you pull the uprights, the cart extends by itself. Worst of all, the caster wheels fell apart. This cart is useless until they fix the flaws in manufacturing."
5,"It's exactly what it says it is, and does exactly what they say it does.","Busy professionals transporting equipment to gigs and trying to store cumbersom carts, bags and boxes are all made easier with the Rock-N-Roller carts. The only short coming is trying to negotiate stairs, then we have to go back to our hand truck."
2,Interesting and Inaccurate,"Linda raises some excellent issues and causes the reader to re-examine many fundamental assumptions. The book is well written and thought provoking.Yet, the appendix discussing the meaning of ""headship"" and submission in Biblical texts is weak and inaccurate in it's analysis of the meaning of the original languages of the New Testament. The Greek words discussed could not mean what the author says unless Jesus Christ is not the leader or source of the church. The author's subsequent divorce may reflect more on her beliefs about marriage than anything she writes here."
1,got it!,"We got it @ Barnes & Noble at half the amazom posted price. Usually Amazon is cheaper than anybody anywhere, but this was rare as hen's teeth. $121.31"
1,Golden Girls anniversary?,"well i bought mine last year complete 7 seasons, in beautiful packaging on DVD's.. I was just wondering how different is this one?At least they could ve thrown Golden Palace, or + add 1 season that we never saw it.. otehrwise i don't see what is the difference, this one or the one that i bought 1 year ago??"
1,$125 for this?!?!?!,"This box set looks and feels home made. I was embarrassed to give it to my friend as a birthday present so I kept it for myself. The DVD packaging is flimsy and the plastic parts that hold the DVD in place aren't even attached to the packaging for each season. It's like it was made at home by a counterfeiter. The image quality of the DVDs are terrible!!! It's like they didn't even try to make it better. On the earlier seasons, it even looks like they just copied it straight from VHS format without doing any tweaking at all. This all is terribly unfortunate, as I love this show and it deserves more respect than this joke of a collection."
3,"One edpisode has a skip in the disc, when it took it out, I could see a scratch first time I played them. I didn't do it.","It's great but as mentioned above, one of the edpisodes has a skip in the disk. I didn't do it. It was there when they arrived at my address."
2,dvd case falling apart,The plastic dvd holder fell out and the dvd kept falling out of case and it would not fit back into case. The quality of the first dvd was not good.
5,Hours of fun,"This is a great deal. Golden Girls is possibly one of the best comedies on Television. The ladies deliver their lines on cue leading to hours of laughter. You will relate to each of the characters, Rose the naive, Blanche the promiscuous one, Dorothy the sensible yet sarcastic school teacher and Sophia the incorrigible yet lovable grandma."
5,Loved it!,I bought two of my daughters this for Christmas and they were thrilled. They watch them over and over. They were just what they wanted.
1,WORST BUYING EXPERIENCE EVER!,"i PURCHASED THIS SET FROM ""TONYS DEPOT"" MANY OF THE DISKS ARE SCRATCHED. I AM UNABLE TO WATCH THEM. I ATTEMPTED TO E-MAIL THIS PERSON BUT TO AVAIL.I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ITEM FROM ""TONY'S DEPOT"" AGAIN!!!! I HOPE EVERYONE READS THIS!"
1,Buyer beware.,"This is not Amazon's fault, but if the seller is Best Seller Alive, use caution. I ordered the complete set and alomost none of the discs worked,my dvd player even kicked a few out!! I suspect they were bootlegged. The seller did not help me, they only told me this has never happened with The Golden Girls before, and offered no soultions. I filed a claim with Amazon, and they gave me a refund. So please be sure you buy this set from Amazon direct or a respectable seller."
1,Dvds did not play,"I got this box set as a gift. I was told only the first season disc played, the rest were not playable. So needless to say I will not be ordering from this vendor again"
5,The Golden Girls series,I purchased the full series for my mother of 75. She has altzehimers and watches at least 3 episodes per night. We are currently on season 6 & she andd I love it. I would recommend this series to all. It is well worth the money.The Golden Girls - The Complete First Season
2,Poor quality,The quality of the discs are not to my liking.. It appears that copies might be 2nd or 3rd generation from the original and sold accordling. Not original and clarity is not good.
3,Poor Quality DVDs,"I bought this set to give as a gift. When my friend watched these his first reaction was ""very poor quality."" He is playing them on an advanced Blue-Ray player. He also has the complete set of Will and Grace and those are wonderful quality. We compare the playback of these disks to the show being played on the WE network and there is no comparison. WE wins hands down. I think the fact that these are double density disks might have something to do with it. Very disappointed."
4,it's an ok deal,"I bought this thinking it was an actual bamboo type purse it came in, not a cardboard fake one, i am rather disappointed in that because it isn't the best quality box, and also the first season went right into when sophias home burned down, it didn't show when rose and blanche first met in the grocery store which was kind of a bummer. i am overall happy with it just because i love the golden girls, but disappointed on the quality and what i didn't get from it, didn't have as much as it should've had, and i was also expecting them to have the final one in with it where they owned the hotel, that isn't in it either which bummed me out."
1,Discs Skip no matter who you order from,"A friend ordered this exact set for me ages ago. When I first got it some of the discs skipped - brand new out of package. Unfortunately, no matter who you order this box set from, they all skip the same way, starting mid-set (4th/5th season discs). I actually had to wait until Hallmark channel played those seasons in order to watch them all the way through!So it's not a good deal no matter who you order from. SORRY!"
3,"what about the ""golden Palace""?","Golden Girls 1-7 has been out for quite some time. How about ""completeing"" the series collection with the one and only season of ""The Golden Palace"". Isnt it about time?"
4,music,"I liked several of the songs an of course ""Reach Out, I'll be There"" is the best. No problems with delivery or arriving on time either."
1,Boring Indian Pretend Lounge Music,"What a great hype and what a terrible product. The music is simply boring, no real imagination and just plain repeatative and unimaginative.A constant beat is not the only element that should prevade musical creativity. The songs and lyrics are not engaging. A real disappointment."
2,bird seed bell,would not purchase again. hard to hang in the net and it appeared the birds had a hard time getting to the seed.
2,poor birds,"When birds avoided the bell,I decided to break it up and put the seeds in a feeder. It was so hard that I had to use a rubber hammer.No wonder the birds didn't like it in the netting. They couldn't break any off! Either make your own or just buy birdseed."
1,Best for squirrels..not birds,"This did nor work for us. Every squirrel in the neighborhood loved it, but the birds never had a chance."
3,Ready to hang?,"I wish I'd read more closely about the hanging part. It says that it comes with a ready to hang net. I put the bell in the net but it doesn't seem too ""ready to hang."" I guess I could spear it with a tree branch or tie it in a knot which would put it really tight against the tree branch. I thought maybe it'd come with a hook or string to tie."
1,Do not waste your money!!!!!,"Was given this as a housewarming gift for my first home, it SUCKS!!! The light is very dim, they fall over in the wind and rain, one of the 4 dosen't work at all. Very poor quality. Friend did not have the reciept and Target won't take it back due to changes to their return policy, I am stuck with a really crappy product that really is NOT WORTH the money!!! I usually love Target products, NOT THIS ONE!!!"
1,Pretty but not a great deal,"I must concur with the other reviewer of this product. Though the stakes are pretty sturdy, and the lights look sweet when lit, my set came with one light that just will not work - unless the globe is UPSIDE DOWN. Took it apart to try and fix the connections, still no luck. Take a pass on this one.UPDATE: After just two days all but one of the lights is now nonfunctional. Garbage. I have never been so disappointed in a product purchased from Amazon. If I could give this zero stars I certainly would!"
3,nice looking but,if your light is not in full sun they do not have a very bright lite. But the lamps really look nice though.
3,Bateries suck,Nice looking lights. Not real bright. Biggest complaint is the batteries must be old. They only hold a charge for a couple hours.
2,Barbie Fasion Pack Games,"Even being a HUGE barbie fan, i don't reccommend it. It gets very boring, and kepping track of multiple passwords isn't a favorite of mine. If you still are interested, rent it first!"
1,hated it,"boring ,no fun game, my 5 year old daughter hated it, passwords have to written down, the only one who might enjoy this game probably doesn't have any other gameboy game to play with."
2,Okay.,"The book is entirely in black and white, which takes a lot from the entire book. Part of the elegance of the Surfer series is the majesty of the visuals. The first set of stories are largely simplistic, but worth the read. It is hard to get past the fact though that it appears as if you're reading a bunch of line drawings rather than an actual cartoon series."
3,pages are black and white,"Great to have the complete silver surfer series in one volume, but I was disappointed to open it up and find them all in black and white...it would have been nice if this had been made clear in the information about his book...."
1,Solenoid locks up and will not disengage.,"I installed this starter solinoid on my 1991 F-150. I seldom drive it. After about fifty starts, the solinoid got stuck in the energized position and continued to spin the starter with the key turned off. I had to remove a battery terminal to stop the starter.This has happened twice in the last twenty starts (once last night). I leave the terminal loose so I can remove it quickly. I have to beat on the solinoid with a hammer to get it to release.I will replace it soon. I will not use a Borg Warner part this time."
2,An imitation,"This film has good performances in Steiger and Jacob, but falls short with the lead, Patric. I've always liked his work and I can't blame him for the problem, after all the director saw the dailies, and surely he caught on to the fact that his lead character was unlikable. But with a lovely European love interest, nice scenery and a ""catch a thief"" plot I had hoped for better.(Not to forget the illusion to The 49 Steps, with the two leads handcuffed to each other.) But there's no charm in Harry Donovan, you only root for him as he's the least dispicable character. Understanding his motives and feeling his losses comes a bit late, and the beret and careless Pollock wardrobe doesn't help. If you have nothing else to do on a rainy day it's nice for the art, but don't go out of your way. As for Patric, save your time for The Journey of August King, it's wonderful."
1,Made for TV quality,"Saw 'Victory' and thought it would be fun to see Irene Jacob in something else. Read the reviews here and thought this sounded interesting. Not! Nothing is believable about this effort. We hated Jason Patric's character throughout and found the 'love affair' ridiculous, to say the least! This is a sad and embarrassing movie. To be avoided."
3,Good Plot and Good Performances,"This film is propelled by a good plot and the performances of Patric and Steiger. Harry Donovan is a jerk, but remember that he is an anti-hero, and he gradually becomes more likable as the film goes on. Great detail goes into the making of the forgery. One small flaw is that Ian Holm was wasted in a bit part. He should have been the main villian."
4,"Excellent, believable, unlike usual tripe, superb acting","Kudos to the casting direction of Incognito the first excellent movie I have watched in ages for finding truly believable characters from the smallest bit part to the lead. Jason Patric was cynical and arrogant enough to have actually accepted the offer made by sleazy dealers. His love for his father was so delicately displayed that it belied some of his cynicism. And his gradual mellowing after meeting Irene Jacob was tangible. Having done extensive traveling I enjoyed the scenery, but being much too busy to spend time with most immature plots dwelling on excessive violence rather than story material, this film was highly recommended and I agree with every word of praise. It isn't for the young who enjoy cars, boats, planes and buses being blown up. But then some of us who would enjoy watching a good film are adults."
5,LOVE THIS FILM!,"Whether you are an art lover or not, this film has everything a great film has: terrific acting, plot, locations, cinematography, pacing, artful sex, and intriguing dialogue. If you appreciate art, the process of restoration, the mystery of forgery, this will engage and delight you. I can't believe I hadn't seen it before now- 2011. I bought it immediately so that I can view it again and again. Lolly Anderson"
4,Great movie for movie lovers,"A superb film about art and deception. The movie went almost unnoticed at the Box-Office maybe because of the leading actor J. Patric who failed to give an appealing character, however the movie is balanced by I. Jacob and R. Steiger. The main strenght of the movie is the story about Art/life deception and the way the story is being told. The director J. Badham managed to produce a great value film."
2,"Well, the photography was good.","This is a very weak film, asking you to think of a young soap opera male as one of the planet's great artists and an equally young and skinny bimbo as the world's major Rembrandt expert. The bimbo accidentally spills coffee on the hunk and before long they are in bed. And then there is the story. It panders to every taste likely to be in the theater: chase scenes, nudity, and violence for the teen males; melodrama for the weepers, and a happy and wholly unbelievable ending for the lame of brain. This film has ""made for TV"" written all over it.Ian Richardson makes a brief appearance as a barrister, and he must have been ashamed to take the money. Rod Serling, from the sad look of him, needed all the cash he could get. Save this flick for the SOAP network and hope that the commercials will entertain."
2,Not Enough Practical Info,"This book offers a review of current research on substance use in adolescents and college age students, but I was looking for more practical guidance on doing therapy with kids who use drugs, and this was only covered slightly. I was hoping that this would be the main focus of the book, considering the subtitle ""reaching teens through brief interventions"". It was kind of a let down."
3,Cuba/Haiti,Host does a great job of spicing up what can be a boring topic to students. I use these movies in my geography class to help students visualize what the countries we are covering in class look like.
1,weak,This was my first `globe trekker' DVD view - There was little about Haiti. It was shallow if you were looking for more than parties. A production as feeble as this getting sponsoring by an auto company - I found that amazing.
3,Solid Gemmell,"Coming at the end of a mature phase of Gemmell's career, starting in 1996 with the Legend of Deathwalker and including Dark Moon and Winter Warriors, Echoes is probably the weakest of these four novels. However, Gemmell revitalises himself with Sword in the Storm the next year.The glory of the Avatar civilisation, which once ruled the earth, is now fading and primitive tribes push to topple them. Here Gemmell uses an Atlantis premise, linked to his earlier use of energy crystals (Sipstrassi stones in a new guise, from Wolf in Shadow, Ghost King and others) to paint a picture of a dying race. All the normal Gemmell traits are there, but under the shadow of the excellent Dark Moon and Winter Warriors, it seems curiously lacklustre and even lead characters rather flat. Perhaps this was due to Gemmell re-exploring old themes, something that occasionally holds him back from really top form. A good solid read however, though not his best, you could do a lot worse."
3,"good , but nowhere near as fantastic as his other books","This was a good story , but not up to his standard! I mean, in the end i could have cared less about what happened to the characters! My basic quibble is that it was too short. He didn't develop his charaters enough: they just sat on the sidelines and seemed almost lifeless. Sofartia for example, she began as an interesting character then poof! Nothing. Druss the Ledgend made me cry , but this book left me feeling that I'd just wasted 24 hours of my life."
3,Good Read,"This used to be my favorites book when I was a kid, and so I decided to reread it... and was disappointed.It's a good read, pretty nice with a good plot and story-line but the writing gets a bit annoying at sometimes: explaining trivial things, and pointing out irrelevant details."
3,Not the standard Gemmell fare,"This is not your normal Gemmell novel. 3 stars are in comparison to his other work...4 stars for comparison with other novels. Do NOT get me wrong. It has many great things to offer but I found it subpar in comparison to the Drenai and Rigante Series.A little more slow moving, but definately different from his usual novels.If you read RA Salvatore this is similar to the Demon series in comparison to the regular Icewind Dale series (still one of my favorites).Look for more political intrigue and less hack'm up and slash em action."
4,Echoes of Gemmell's Bloodstone Novels....,"Although 'Echoes of the Great' Song has nothing in common world-wise with the universe of John Shannon & the Bloodstone novels (Also by Gemmell)...like all Gemmell books, the story seems to fit naturally into a common multiverse he has created that tie every fantasy novel he has written together in some subtle way (Especially with the Bloodstone books). Because of this, after having read any Gemmell book, it is easy to pick up another & keep the mood flowing with all new characters & settings. One character really stands out more than the others in this novel (I can't tell you who!) & you have a hard time trying to figure out if you should hate this character & like him because there are both things to despise & love about him. His eventual fate is worth the whole read in my opinion....very fitting if not a bit warped sense of humor at the end....Read it!"
2,Echoes of a soso song....,This was a book club pick for my group and I found this to be a very predictable story. Can be read quickly and falls in the category of brain candy.
5,La June is the Bomb in Gospel,"I have never heard of this artist until I attended a function that played one of the tracks from her album. That was it!!! I had to have a CD of my own. You must listen to the gift of ministry in song through this artist!! All of the tracks are good!! Especially, title track Changes and My King. I listen to the album everyday, humming the tunes, hearing the songs over and over. What A Blessing!!-If you havent heard this album, you have cheated yourself out of hearing an annoited, gifted artist. I hope she cuts another album soon! Nina S.(Illinois)"
5,send you annointing,Send your annointing is simply wonderful. It takes you into a place of worship. This CD ministers to my soul. I have gone through numerous situations in my life and this CD has helped me go through them. She has a soothing tone. This is the CD to get if you want the manifested presence of GOD and want to go from Glory to Glory.
3,A good beginner book on Classical Chinese poetry,"Arthur Cooper includes an introduction to get the reader up to speed on Chinese literary history and the development of Chinese Kanji.The translation of poems loose most of the musical qualities and doesn't sufficiently create a sense of poem. In Cooper's introduction he discusses some of these problems, but having read other tanslation of Li Po, it is an adequate translation.One of the strengths of this edition is that it has the chinese version on the opposite page, so it does try to bridge the gap.The book is intended as an introduction to Chinese poetry and provides enough information for those who want to know the history and expose themselves to Li Po and Tu Fu"
5,Fantastic,This book was well worth buying. It really has helped and I found it very enjoyable to read. It wasn't boring or filled with medical terms as other books on this topic that I have read. It was packed with information and tips to really help someone stop smoking. I'm so glad I read it!
1,Pure garbage,"It doesn't seem a tall order. Film a nice fireplace using a high quality camera and add a christmas music soundtrack. Encode this in 5.1 sound and sell it.This product fails miserably. The ""hand adding firewood"" is an alarming nuisance, the picture quality is low and the music is not encoded in high quality. I'm not sure how this product made it into the majestic halls of Amazon.com."
5,WHAT A GREAT BOOK,"I just read this book in one day and couldn't put it down. It was everything a good novel should be--a great story, a powerful, poetic writing style, and a strong social message. This is a must read! If you want to laugh, cry, and learn more about Palestine and Palestinians--get a copy of The Woman I Left Behind."
2,Headlines with no depth,"I think it's safe to say that any book with the selling hook of some conveniently relative, yet irrelevant, number of so called tips or strategies for doing this or that is going to pretty much suck. With all due respect for this guy Arnold Lazarus and his coming up with multi-modal therapy... this book is so basic, it really won't solve any of your problems. Consider it more like a phone book, if anything, with 101 contacts. It reminds me of watching Dr. Phil. The guy does nothing but offer references to solve your problems while using his name and fame as an acclaimed expert to get all the credit.Save your money and harness the power of Google to do a little research on your own, then buy the book that's right for you, not the one that tries a catch-all approach and makes about 2 pages of space for each topic, not to mention the redundancy and repetition throughout."
2,Didn't get my money's worth,Was a bit disappointed.. Korean movies usually hit the mark but this one didn't! It was a good story but I really don't buy the fact that someone as smart as this dude couldn't see it coming....
4,A Little-Known Woody Herman Album,"Not one of Woody Herman's best but, nevertheless, a very good live, jazz-rock performance from May 1969. This 1969 band exhibits that driving enthusiasm which was characteristic of the Herd bands in the forties and fifties. The two selections which I found to be the most exciting and enjoyable were ""Light My Fire"" and the classic, ""Caldonia"". Woody Herman fans should certainly consider adding this '1969 Herd' to their library."
2,Save your money and buy another case,Flimsy with clear plastic over the keyboard. Makes the keys hard to use. Clip is ok. Better off if you buy a different case as this case does not protect your Treo.
3,"Okay Case, plastic annoying","The case is very nice, however the plastic cover over the keyboard and screen is very annoying and makes use of the Treo difficult if not impossible at times.However, this is a good low cost solution. I recommend spending a little more for a nice case which does not have the plastic cover."
1,poor protection for your Treo,"My initial excitement with the case ebbed when my phone slipped out of the case twice and hit the ground hard... It's a nice-looking case, but the risk of accidentally ""unbuttoning"" the single top button, the phone spinning around (""freewheeling design"") and falling out of the case is high. After dropping my Treo twice, I am getting a new case..."
3,Sturdy and easy to install,Bought this for my mother-in-law after she had a stroke and it helped her get in and out of the tub. We did end up removing it because she said it was too bulky and got in her way of getting in and out of tub. She uses a shower chair in her tub so that takes up a lot of room and because the rail has to stay in place (does not easily move back and forth once installed although it can be loosened with a wrench and moved)she did not like it.
3,Twice a Kiss by Carol Wood (Mills & Boon Medical Romance),"Description from the book back cover:Having been jilted at the altar, Dr. Erin Brooks devoted herself to her job as a Dorset GP. Then she met Nick Hansen again! Erin was startled at the level of attraction she felt for him, but, having decided to trust no one, and convinced Nick still had feelings for his ex-girlfriend, she tried very hard to hold him at bay ..."
5,Down Home Girl - Fantastic CD,"I am a huge fan of Old Crow Medicine Show, so this a great addition to my CD collection. I have seen them in person a couple of times and fell in love with their music. Fits right in with my East Tennessee heritage. OCMS has a great influence in the Johnson City, TN area. We feel honored to be mentioned in their Wagon Wheel song. Their music is a direct reflection of the East Tennessee roots and heritage. We are mountain music people and Old Crow Medicine Show delivers this type of music."
2,Disappointing,"Spider-Man has had a pretty good track record when it comes to the DS, which is part of what makes Spider-Man: Friend or Foe so disappointing. The game's premise is quite interesting though: to stop a massive, mystery threat, Spidey must team up with a laundry list of his rogues gallery (Green Goblin and Doc Ock among others) and take down hordes of other baddies. While Friend or Foe starts out fun, the repetitive beat downs quickly degenerate into sheer boredom. The game looks decent enough, and the characters are well animated, and the moments of voice work are a nice touch too, but there's simply not enough here to warrant more than a rental at best, and that may be too generous. There's some fun moments here and there, but in the end, Spider-Man: Friend or Foe ends up being another quickly assembled, rushed out, licensed game that could have been better than it is."
2,Dumb Game,The characters are very cartoonish and my son hates it. He recommends this for a 5 year old - he's 10. The case looks like alot more fun then it really is while playing.
3,GEORGE AND THE DRAGON,This was a delightfull childrens Movie with likable cast such as Piper Perabo as the rebellious Princess looking out for the dragon and George Purefuoy as the reluctant hero. The special effects were cheesy but Patric Swayze made a good villian.
1,I need a driver for windows xp,I have a great camera I guess . I can't seem to find a driver for it so I really don't know.Be sure you know what you are buying .Once they have your money it is hard to get any answers .
1,Class Action Lawsuit?,"Can we say Class Action Lawsuit here? This camera is a piece of junk and Thompson Consumer Electronics knows it. They just ""know"" that we won't band together as a group and force them to stand behind their product. We all know about the horrible battery life and that is to be somewhat expected. The major issue is the battery door which fails on each and every camera after a time. It would be simple for them to engineer a new one but costly so they ignore it and tell you that the only thing you can do is to purchase a replacement camera. The problem is, that with the new camera ($150) the battery door lasted about 2 weeks and started to crumble just as the original camera battery door. Contacting customer service is a joke either through email or through their 800 number. We need to get together as a group and sue them to make them stand behind their product. For what I have spent on this thing, I could have purchased a decent Sony."
1,JUNK,"Biggest piece of junk of a camera ever made. Sold new for 199.00. Breaks, and Thompson doesn't back them up...sorry....stay away"
1,This camera is JUNK,"I am on my third RCA 6300 camera because I can't get a refund only an exchange. The camera worked fine for a few weeks and then started having lock-up problems. The quality of the pictures was great when it was working. After sending back my first camera the second arived with the battery cover already cracked, a problem with the first camera also. When the third camera arrived, brand new batteries were installed but the camera would lock within a few minutes. RCA customer service admits that there has been a high number of returns with these cameras but will only exchange the camera you have for another defective one..."
2,rca 6300 where are the drivers,"GOOD CAMERA OVERALL. 2 STARS BECAUSE THE CAMERA, WHILE TOUTED AS STATE OF THE ART BY RCA,IT IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH MICROSOFT XP. RCA (THOMPSONS) SAY THEY ARE WORKING ON IT, ALL FIVE TIMES I HAVE CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE (PC VOICE RESPONCE) OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS. IF YOU NEVER FEEL LIKE UP GRADING YOUR SYSTEM THIS IS A GOOD CAMERA. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR CUTTING EDGE TECH AND SUPPORT DON.T BUY RCA. I AM BETTING THE CAMMERA WILL BE OUT OF PRODUCTION BEFORE STANDARD OS DRIVERS ARE AVAILABLE!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"Against the Tide came highly recommended to me, but I was unfortunately disappointed by it. There are two kinds of biographies, those that take you alongside a person and those who take you inside a person. This is of the former. This is one of those biographies where you learn all about what Watchman did and the events that were going on around him, but you don't see very much of what was really happening in his life and heart. There were hints of what made him tick, but only hints. In the end, I walked away feeling as if I knew what Nee did, but now who he was or why he did those things. This would make an excellent companion to other biographies of Nee's life or a solid foundation for research on Nee in general, but it fails to be inspiring or motivating."
2,Bigger Dogs,"I bought this for my smaller dogs and cats, they will not push the door open for the food, It would work better on a larger pet."
4,Fly your magic carpet as Barbie Genie,"I am a 30 year old mom and I got this game boy game as one of my 5 year old's first game boy game. My daughter loves this game and enjoys playing all the little mini games in the activity mode. For me, I find I AM THE ONE stealing moments to play this game, but mostly in the mission/adventure mode. It is very addictive, challenging (but not so challenging that my five year old couldn't do) and the graphics and sound are excellent. There are many lands to explore, (cloud city, marketplace, crystal caverns, magic forest, dragon playground & atlantis), lots of mazes, hidden areas and fun little activities that never bore. Trying to train the little pegasus is a lot of fun. If I was my daughter's age, this is the game I would have chosen as my first game boy color game, but I am partial to Arabian themes anyway. The only annoyance is saving the game, it requires a lengthy coded password. Worth every penny."
5,Red's best?,"Red does great work always, but this may just take the cake. It's a concept album, describing a generational journey from Ireland to Oregon Country. It makes fascinating listening from beginning to end, but the individual songs are strong enough to stand on their own. Favorites include ""Texas Bein' Texas"" and ""The Yellowstone Valley.""If you like the idea of a western concept album, you might also look into Sheb Wooley's ""Rawhide/How The West Was Won,"" available now from Amazon. The ""How the West"" portion is the concept, with Sheb describing different aspects of life in the Old West. It's very similar to Stan Jones's great examination of the West, ""This Was The West,"" which is unfortunately only available on the original vinyl. Track them both down if you can."
5,Right on time!,"Every Christian family in America needs to watch this series. It has a really good message, especially for men."
2,Used and dirty!,"The tarp is not as thick as I had hoped, so it won't last long. It's white so it was very easy to see the dirt and footprints on it as I opened it up for the first time. The packaging seemed good, but the product was obviously used."
4,"After 1 year, change to 5 stars.","Too early to rate durability of this tarp as it has been in use for only 1 month as a cover for a large wood-pile. Product met expectations - size good; appears to be sturdy and well made. The only improvement that I could wish for, so far, is that the grommets were spaced a little closer together. Only time will tell how well it holds up under stress from wind.1 year later and after several storms, one being on the outskirts of Sandy, this tarp is holding up well. Rating is now 5 stars in my book."
5,12x16 White Tarp,"Looked in all the local home improvement stores nobody carried White Tarps.Very happy to find it here, it is heavy duty as described."
3,For the price - it solved a problem pretty well,"This product has the potential to be a great product for the price if they just did a couple things better with the grommets; 1) Make them so they're 'equally-spaced' along the edges instead of 'randomly-placed'. 2) Make the grommets just a bit harder to tear-away from the tarp (I did return one of these because of this).I use mine as a sunshade over my wooden lanai, and frankly it works great except for the problems I mentioned."
4,The Truth!!,"ATTENTION:This Is NOT A Real Mr.Shadow CD.He's NOT part Of Low ProFie Records, it's a bunch of songs from complamation CD's. So Don't Even bother buying low pro Chit That has MR.SHADOW's Name, Im Sorry to tell you foo'z but its the TRUTH"
4,What a Marvelous tape,No hype- just real down home. I felt I was there going through the sweat ceremony. this tape was very respectful of Native American ways. My heart is warm after seeing this. This tape really shows the importance of keeping a sacred space in ones life.
3,Inipi Ceremony shared with public?,"It's always been felt that an Inipi ceremony is a sacred rite that is not to be discussed outside of the lodge, but this was the white person's version that explained some things in a basic way."
3,"it's a decent case, with Pet Shop toys","It is what it is: a storage/carry case for Littlest Pet Shop toys. It's made well and holds 15 pets (plus their tiny accessories) in individual cubbies within the case. On the plus side, it comes with two additional Pet Shop toys, and on the down side, the two additional Pet Shop toys reduce the storage capacity for your existing Pet Shop toys down to 13. I couldn't bring myself to give this 4 or 5 stars, because it's just a storage case. I wouldn't consider this product ""fun"" or ""educational"", but the kids like it and it's getting good use for its intended purpose. It does its job - gives my kids a place to put their Pet Shop toys so they don't get lost or stepped on."
4,Great musician saddled with Muzak producer,"I agree totally with a previous review. I saw Richard Bona last week at Jazz Alley in Seattle. He was FANTASTIC! Great rythms, angelic voice, wonderful bass lines, and a great backup band. Bought the CD at the bar, took it home and was a little disappointed at the overdone pop styling. I wish I had a recording of his live show. It was so much better than the disk.But the disk still has a lot of great music, interesting African rythms, and that voice! I hope the next one will be a little closer to the real musician.Check out Richard Bona's music on a cut called ""Mandingo Street"" on Regina Carter's latest CD. The best song on a great disk."
4,Great potential,"I was struck by Bona's beautiful fusion when I first heard this cd played in my favorite music store. As a collector of West African music, Cuban Son, and jazz, I am struck by Bona's masterful combination of these stylings and his own superb technique. There isn't much out there like him yet. I can't wait to hear his next offering. Highly recommended for both 'world' music and jazz afficionados!"
3,Beautiful voice,"Richard Bona has a beautiful voice and it is easy to relax to this wonderful CD. I didn't rate this a 5 because a five is reserved for CD's like Giant Steps or Blue Train. A rating of three doesn't mean I didn't like the CD, it just means that I don't give a CD a rating of 5 haphazardly. Scenes From My Life does have some Sanbornish qualities to it and does get funky at times like in the tune ""Djombwe"". There are even some Indian ragas and a salsa piece. It doesn't matter that one doesn't understand what is being said, what matters is that the music speaks to you. Check this one out. I don't think you will be disappointed. You only get disappointed when you expect too much from a CD."
1,Disappointing first album : way-over-produced instrumentals,"I bought this album largely out of curiosity, having read an article about Bona in Newsweek, which talked about this artist as a major new element in Jazz, today. That is still possible, as he clearly is an amazing musician/ singer. Unfortunately, I think he was had by his producers, who put him with a sugary-sweet Muzak-sounding band. This is much of the problem with what currently it calls itself ""Jazz"", in my opinion. TO find something oriniginal or raw is about impossible. Too bad. Better luck next time."
2,"Decent, not great.","I used to think this stuff was the best coffee around. Until I started trying various other brands, and grinding my own. To which, I came to realize that at best, this stuff is average.Slightly above the canned stuff in the grocery store, thats it. The other reviewer is right, it is ""Nutty"" in flavor, so you really need to love nuts or this one will turn you off. Secondly, it is fairly light roasted. We tend to have more enjoyment from medium-dark to dark roasts. This one doesn't have enough kick.This is a blend, which isn't really a good thing for coffee freaks. I tend to like beans from specific regions in the world, so blends really mess up my taste enjoyment. Blends are generally for people that aren't too serious about Coffee."
3,"It's pretty good, but I would have liked more info on less.","The only problem I found with this book is that it goes through what it talks about very quickly and it assumes you're just going to understand. Not many examples and it talks about some things that it might as well leave out because it doesn't provide any useful information on it. It can be a handy reference from time to time, but it's not the greatest."
4,Excellent filters for good price,Fram has always made great filters and gaskets and I was glad to save a dollar or two by ordering it from Amazon.
3,Very different from their live show,"I heard these folks when the opened for Moby on his recent US tour. I really enjoyed their show (much more so than Moby, who only pranced around the stage to a DAT tape), so I bought their CD. While the live show was much more industrial and featured heavy techno beats set to orchetral melodies, the album is basically more of the same old trance you can hear anywhere. The melodies are still there, but are surrounded by standard electronic bells and whistles. Granted, it's well-produced trance and some tunes are quite catchy, but it isn't anything special. I was suprised to hear a female vocalist on the album (glad she wasn't on the tour...), who lent a trashy ""New Jersey"" feel to any song for which she performed. The bonus CD of live tracks is closer to what I expected, but doesn't come close to recreating the show I saw in Philadelphia. I hope this album represents their early efforts, and the show I saw their new direction, because they have a lot of promise."
3,A mild disappointment,"Being a lover of Hybrid's tunes for years I was looking forward to this release. It was touted as a collection of their previous years work, but somehow managed to miss out their best tracks or did remixes which weren't up to their usual standard. The new stuff, while in their funky flowing style, didn't really get the juices flowing and I've heard remixes since which were better. The bonus CD on the imported version, however, is almost worth owning on its own. By the way, Amazon, it is *Hybrid* not Hybrids :-)."
1,This album stinks!!!!!!!!!,"Nothing new, nothing different. Reviews of this band say how great they are- don't belive the hype! If you want to listen to a band who knows how to make amazing electronic music try: Orbital. 0 out of 5 stars. F-"
5,"Stunning, especially Live Angle","I was introduced to Hybrid while listening to Finished Symphony, Radio Edit. Immediately after that, I have bought the CD and truly enjoyed both of them. The music on CD 1 are good, and I definitely loved If I Survive, Dreaming Your Dreams, Theme From Wide Angle, and Sinequanon. Julee Cruise, in If I Survive, had stunned me with her cry (I have always known Ms. Cruise for her soft and eerie take on a vocal piece like in Twin Peaks Soundtrack or I Know).Other titles, Like Kid 2000, Snyper, High Life, and Finished Symphony, even though good, but the Live Angle version were way better. These pieces were just simply outstanding. That goes for Accelerator as well, which was also featured in Hybrid Remix, but the live version just make you feel like....... accelerating and ascending."
2,"Cute Pictures, That's About It","I found this book quite derivative of Jim Dratfield's Pug Shots both in look and feel. And while the pictures were well done, they don't hold a candle to Dratfield's work. The addition of the Tao-ish story didn't add very much to the overall experience. Buy Pug Shots instead."
5,A face only a brother could love,"I too am a pug owner, 2 of them in fact. This book is great and the pictures of course are the centrepiece. How often have I seen my own pugs in the situations that you will find Wilson. Wilson of course, verbalises the wisdom that all pugs share. This is a must own for dog lovers period!"
5,A Treasure,"The Tao of Pug is a wonderful book. I had never noticed the similarity between pug behavior and Taoism before. Taoists believe that people are good by nature, and that one should be kind to others simply because such treatment will probably be reciprocated. Pugs are naturally friendly and trusting. Taoism is focused on nature. Pugs happen to be very fascinated with nature (mostly by the parts of nature that are edible). Taoists seek answers to life's problems through inner meditation and outer observation. Have you ever seen the quizical look of a pug? This is a fun approach to both Tao and the Pug!"
5,Hilarious and Adorable!,"I LOVED ""The Tao of Pug"" by Wilson the Pug! One of the best Pug books I've found. Who knew you could learn so much from a Pug?!? Great photography... how does Nancy Levine get Wilson the Pug to pose like that!?! You can't help but smile when holding this book! Highly recommended!"
3,cute for girls; annoying for parents,"My girls were thrilled to get this DVD from Thomas Nelson - they really enjoy the God's Little Princess items from Sheila Walsh so this was sort of like icing on the cake. Pink and frilly Gigi is God's little princess and wants to share the news with her friend and neighbor but things keep falling apart. She is finally able to do what she knows God would want her to do. In the second title Gigi leans about God wanting us to show love to others.I'll admit I was a bit bored with this movie but my girls were very much into it - par for the course in this house. I will say neither I, my husband or my oldest daughter thought the use of lord toward Gigi's cat was correct - considering the nature of the DVD - God. This did lead to us discussing the fact that we don't call others lords and there is only one Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ, even though Sarah did call Abraham lord in the Old Testament."
4,Learn life's lessons through biblical scriptures,"Gigi, God's Little Princess, is a happy child who loves to laugh sing and knows God loves her. When I first put in the video my child started to smile and noticed the clouds in the video and started to dance to the opening song. The story Gigi's Hugest Announcement, has wonderful stories which viewers can learn life's lessons through biblical scripture. At the end of each story a biblical quote is discussed as the moral of the story. The narrator summarizes the story with pictures from the book, which is a nice touch. The bonus/extras section is very interactive - including sing-along songs and trivia game. A wonderful video for parents and children to watch together as a family."
3,It wasn't a new book,"I paid a higher price just to get a new one, but finally got one that didn't look new."
3,Destroy all music.,"I'm not sure how to relate to this. This is almost pure noise, but -good- noise, if that term somehow is applicable.There's a few quiet lulls during the song but then Ken Vandermark and crew come out blasting, blazing away with the horns loud, and fast. Although there is some great funky toe-tapping horn tooting buried in the 5th track."
2,Hokey and intense,"I also have the tai chi for beginners and chi kung. This does not have the same relaxed style, music, and scenic backdrops. Shot in a studio. I was looking for something as a next step to the tai chi but was not ready to stand on my head as in the warmup to this video. Also, has the intensity and bravado of a chinese action movie, not the relaxed instruction style from the other videos that i was looking for."
4,Excellent tape!,"David Carradine put together a very good video here.It is a bit more relaxed than a Karate teaching tape and the stretches, excercises on this tape make for a good low intensity workout."
2,Sloppy form - sad to say,"I was very disappointed in the sloppy form (from the stretching exercises to the combination exercises). I expected a Master of Kung Fu to be consistent about every body movement. The stretching exercises were incredibly sloppy and demonstrated not by Carradine but by the students, maybe Carradine can't do the exercises anymore. I would recommend Rodney Yee's ""Yoga for Strength"" to see the proper form for most of the stretching exercises. I'll keep looking for a Kung Fu instructional tape showing correct form. As for Carradine's Tai Chi tape to accompany the Kung Fu tape, I much prefer Terry Dunn's Tai Chi. For the simple and important reason, NO SLOPPY MOVEMENTS."
4,FOR THOSE THAT KNOW OR JUST WANT TO LEARN KUNG FU,"THIS FILM PROVIDES KNOWLEDGE FOR THE BEGINNER TO ADVANCED PRACTITIONER ON 5 DIFFERENT KUNG FU FORMS. I, AS A BEGINNER, FOUND IT EASY TO FOLLOW; BUT, I FELT THAT IT REVOLVED MORE AROUND INTERMEDIATE PRACTIONERS.I DO, HOWEVER, RECOMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS FOLLOWABLE ENOUGH FOR THE BEGINNER, YET NOT TOO SLOW FOR THE ADVACED PRACTIONERS TO PERFORM THE EXERCISES THAT IT TEACHES."
5,Excellent!,"This series of DVDs is the best series of travelogues I have seen and I've seen many of them. It is very comprehensive and well done. They give you just enough historical background of each city then show you both the outside and inside of about 20 of the top attractions, such as cathedrals, museums, parks and palaces. They don't waste time showing you things that you can see anywhere as some travelogues do-- you see what is unique to the city being discussed. They concentrate on the core of the city. You will feel like you really know the city when the DVD is done. This DVD was produced in the 21st century so it is a generation more up-to-date than most travelogues you see. Both the photography and the narration are excellent. Highly recommended."
2,Quick Tour of Dublin and Paris,I was disappointed with this book in that it seemed to very briefly cover some standard sights at each of the two cities. There was little depth in the coverage and a great deal of interesting information about the cities and their cultures seemed absent. I would prefer separate and much more intensive books about each of the two locations.
3,Average book. Returned it.,"I ordered this book hoping to find more information and different recipes for skin and hair care. I was somewhat disappointed with the content of the book, as the explanations weren't terribly detailed. I also found the measurements difficult, because many of the recipes call for quantities to be in grams instead of teaspoons or tablespoons, etc. I wound up returning it after a couple of days. It just wasn't what I was looking for at all."
4,Shaman......,"Ian is a great artist. This isn't the Cult, but it's not supposed to be. Alot of textures in this recording. Cool lyrics. All of the songs are solid."
3,solo fair,There are no songs like She Sells Sanctuary or Fire Woman here but all the the songs are fairly solid. This is a decent solo effort for Ian but I can't wait for the new Cult album. All in all if you are a Cult fan this is a decent purchase.
4,Ian still has it,"It may not exactly be The Cult, but Ian's voice is still enough of a reason to pick this one up. High Time Amplifier is a great tune, and you'll find a new version of The Witch as well. This is an all around good album."
1,No sign of The Cult....,"First of all, this rating would have gotten 2 stars, but the lack of photos and lame cover bumps it down to 1. As a long-time fan of The Cult, I thought I would branch off and follow Ian Astbury's solo career, anxiously awaiting this CD, and hoping to forget ""Holy Barbarians."" Oops! Unfortunately, he has derailed from the dark, poetic lyrics of such CD's as ""Love"" and ""Dreamtime,"" along with the Native American themes, and the arena-rock influence of ""Sonic Temple"" and ""Ceremony."" If you are a fan of the early-to-mid career of The Cult, steer clear. If you are a fan of the later synth-pop sound of The Cult, the single ""The Witch,"" or the album ""The Cult"", then this CD may be for you. This CD is very synth-pop. The track ""Metaphysical Pistol"" is trip-hop. The last track, ""Shambala"" is instrumental trip-hop/ambient. Meanwhile, I will be hoping Ian and The Cult return to their roots."
1,Ian's a great singer and weak writer,"I LOVE Ian's voice. He can sell any song...except apparently ones he's written without Billy Duffy. I don't find this cd to be worth more than one or two pained listenings. Other than his great voice it has nothing to recommend it and it's NOWHERE near the level of his work with the Cult. Even as a 'stretch' or experiment it achieves very little. It's a musical equivalent of a vanity press release, an ego ejaculation."
5,Diamond in the rough,"The Dvd miniseries (because thats what it ultimately became) isn't an indie-cult phenom or a big-budget success, but the concept and story does have the same undeniable charm that would merit it to be one (im sure in an alternate reality it was). The casting was so perfect its almost spooky. As for the dvd set, the Dvd extras included are packed with alot of behind-the-scenes info, amazing given the little material available. The packaging is small, slim and saves space. Its such a shame Wonderfalls got cancelled but whoever discovers this diamond-encrusted easter egg is very lucky, indeed."
5,Awesomely awesome!!! Wait is awesomely a word?,"Another fox show cut off in its prime. This series had several actors and actress that have really made it. This series is quirky x 3, over falling water and inanimate objects that talk, wait am I giving too much away? Anyhow, it's basically a story of how everyone is trying to find themselves but they are not always where they think they will be, understand? But how can they be when a bear in a barrel is talking to them or a wax lion for that matter. I dunno, I've watched this series over and over, still I revel in its frivolousness."
5,Fox does it again!!!!!!,"This show would have ran for 5 seasons if those mindless monkeys gave it a chance.Hey,Fox keep making those stupid mindless reality shows you MORONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY IT AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO BUY IT ALSO."
5,the best show never seen,"Fox really blew it with this one. This show is one of the funniest and most original shows ever on tv. Fox gave it almost no promotion, put it on Fridays for two weeks and other nights for the only other two shows seen. This is what ""Joan of Arcadia"" wishes it could be. Buy this and you won't be sorry!"
4,Fox must pick lineup blindfolded,"Much has been said here about the way Fox put Wonderfalls on its lineup, and cancelled it even with glowing reviews. I can't fathom how Arrested Development made it through the pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey method of programming, but thank goodness it did!At least there are now about two good shows on network television! My husband remarks about my buying of tv shows on DVD because I've already seen them (not so the case here.) At least they're shows I know I like and have SOME intelligence, look at what's on THIS season! I'll stick with my Wonderfalls, Arrested Development, Northern Exposure, Seinfeld, etc. any day."
3,OK,"I enjoyed watching this show, but I won't bother watching it again. I should have rented it. It's not a bad show, but all the hype around it is not justified IMO."
5,Great Series!,I can't imagine why this show did not stay on the air!Great writing and wonderful characters.Very different...hilarious and thought provoking.We watch it over and over!
5,A Promising Show Life Cut Tragically Short,"I just discovered this show via DVD. It is without a doubt the most fantastic series I've ever watched. Interesting, original, snarky, and bitingly funny. The erstwhile bartender, Eric, and his relationship with hard to get Jaye is such a delight to watch. I couldn't help but grin ear to ear whenever they were both on screen. The amazing family bond angle was refreshing to see amidst the usual dysfunction in primetive TV too.I can just envision how superb and long running this series could have been if given a proper chance. It's true, only the good die young."
5,Wonderfalls........WONDERFUL!,"I have just purchased this DVD set from Amazon and can't wait for it to arrive. After watching the first episode on networktelevision I was hooked. This is a wonderful show with a great cast of characters. I have seen all thirteen episodes and guarantee that new viewers and fans alike will not be disappointed in this set! If you have any questions regarding this series or it's actors visit the SaveWonderfalls website, itis loaded with information and lots of fun to navigate :)"
2,Very Disappointed.....,"I enjoy Bryan Fuller's ""Pushing Daisies"" and the talented Lee Pace, but ""Wonderfalls"" was a big disappointment. The main character (Jaye) really ruined the show for me. She's annoying, tactless, and tries so hard to pass for cute it makes her scenes almost excruciating to watch. The show's saving grace is it's supporting cast.Just to clarify- I did watch all of the episodes hoping it would get better and there were some entertaining moments, but not enough to warrant an above average rating. I think this show had too many writing and production problems and tried to focus on too select of an audience. It also felt very dated at times (while watching I got the sense that it was a mid 90's show but was surprised to see that it was made in 2004).Overall, ""Wonderfalls"" lacks the charm and wit of Fuller's ""Pushing Daisies"". I recommend purchasing the latter instead."
5,THE BEST SHOW IVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this dvd from amazon having never seen even a minuite of the show as i live in the uk, but a friend of mine said i simply have to see it and she was not wrong.Every minuite of the show is genius and hilarious i dont know how many times i nearly wet myself with the witty one liners.Please please please i urge you to buy the dvd its is great.I DO NOT KNOW HOW FOX didnot pick this up for a second season, is is a travisty!"
5,What a great series,"The concept is interesting, the characters are compelling, and the stories interesting. It's the story of a reluctant hero, drafted against her will to help others.The idea is an interesting one. Inanimate objects give the lead character hints of actions she needs to take to avoid serious consequences. Most of the time the consequences are for someone else, which means helping an often hard-to-help person.Like a horoscope, the objects do a good job of dropping hints of what actions need to be taken to ensure a good outcome. And like a horoscope, those hints can be interpreted in many different ways. Misinterpreting the hints provides the mystery that drives the stories.Though it was canceled after only one season, they did write a full story, so there you aren't stuck with a cliffhanger at the end of the last episode that never gets resolved.Highly recommended."
5,Too good for TV,"This is simply the best television show I've ever seen. The characters are all fully realized from the start, and the writing is excellent. It only lasted briefly for better or worse, but the quality of each episode of consistently good."
5,Love love love it,"The only upsetting part of this series is that it only lasted 1 short season.This show had so much potential to be so much more than it ever got the chance to be.The series is quirky, to say the least, but the humour, the writing, the acting, and the stories are always entertaining, rarely disappoint... and they always manage to keep you guessing as to what will happen next. And just when you think you've figured things out, they change it up yet again.Good fun, it's worth checking it out; it's one of my favorite television series now, no wonder everyone kept telling me to get things in gear and watch this series - you should too!"
4,Une version franaise?,"J'habite en France, la série est actuellement diffusée sur le sattelite. Une version franaise du DVD est elle prévue?"
5,Great Show!!,"I caught only three episodes on FOX before they cancelled it >:-(Happly, fan support got FOX to produce the DVD :-)Smart humor, well written, great acting by whole cast including guest stars.My favorite episodes are Pink Flamingos, Crime Dog, Safety Canary, Totem Mole and the ""tour de force ""Cocktail Bunny.My favorite muse is the Lovesick AssIf you like Wonderfalls also check out Dead Like Me."
2,not so good entertainment,Caroline Dhavernas Has a funny way she pulls her mouth! Actually very stupid! Then the acting is poor and the script is confusing I did not enjoy the series at all and will not recommend it! Maybe if a more natural girl was doing the main rollI I would have given it a score of 3 And then of cause the Name of the Lord GOD that is use so many times in vain Sis on you !!!!!
1,Thank God it was Canceled.,"This show was awful from the start. I watched the first episode and was left with such a horrible distaste for the main character Jaye Tyler that I couldn't stand her. This show was supposed to compete with Joan of Arcadia and it couldn't.Joan Girardi is everything that Jaye Tyler couldn't be. I couldn't get passed the first episode of Wonderfalls, because Jaye was rude to everyone and used language that you would never hear Joan Girardi use. I will not waste my money on the DVD series. Dang! I had to give this crap one star, it deserves zero in my opinion."
5,This is my FIRST review-Great Show!,"This is the first time I have ever written a review for Amazon or anyone else. I just finished watching this show on DVD and loved it. The pilot episode ""Wax Lion"" was a little hard to get into, but don't give up. Keep watching as this show and these characters will grow on you and you will not be able to stop watching.I do not remember this show when it aired. Of course it was gone so fast, how could anyone? I am so glad, though, that I stumbled on to this show while searching Amazon. I read many of the reviews and decided to take a chance. As many other reviewers have written, it is as if the creators and writers knew this show might not make it, so it does have a nice 13 part story and ending, but it could have gone on from there. I highly recommend this DVD collection!"
5,Great Show! Almost as good as Dead like Me.,Great Show! Almost as good as Dead like Me. Quarky is a good way.
5,Best DVD I have. Best show since Buffy.,"I love this show so much, I sometimes I forget I am watching a DVD, and I half expect Forever Eden (another cancelled FOX show) to start. FOX made a HUGE mistake in cancelling Wonderfalls. Because of this, I HATE FOX and will not watch any of their new shows. I loved the Simpsons and Malcolm in the Middle, I even like American Idol, but I will not watch these shows anymore because they are on this horrible network. Wonderfalls was a great show, and I am so glad that I have the DVD, I'm just dissapointed that after the 13th episode, it will be over. BUY THIS SHOW NOW. lol. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
5,"Wonderfalls is an amazing show, gone before its time!",FOX made the worse mistake EVER by cancelling this show. Nough' said.
3,Amusing.,This show is amusing to watch since I sometimes catch myself talking to inanimate objects. It's interesting to watch how each episode plays out and the humor is quick and intelligent. Too bad it was so quickly canceled off the air.
5,Tragic,"Why does all the amazing tv get killed? Love the quirky humor.. wish there were more shows out there like it. The characters and the acting are solid, the humor is a perfect balance of sharp and odd. Also Tyron Leitso is super hot."
5,wonderfalls complete viewer edition,this show was awesome! i am so sorry it was cancled. Quality entertainment! and very creative.
5,Wonderful WonderFalls,"Just got finished watching the entire series and I want more. It is a complete shame that they cancelled this show. It is sooo funny and unbelievably quirky you can't help but get involved and attached to the characters. The cast is amazing! You can't help but fall for Tyron Leitso. And the catchy equally quirky theme song. 'I wonder wonder why the wonder wonder falls, I wonder why the wonder falls on me ...'FOX strikes again ... smh"
5,Another loss due to TV exec's bad decisions,"If you are contemplating this series, I would say go for it if you like quirky, intelligent dialogue that is not cookie-cutter or sterile. It's a very funny, sometimes dark humor show.If you look at the almost 300 reviews here, you will see that only 13 or so were 3 stars or under.....that should say a lot.I was very disappointed when the Network Execs pulled this one.At least it is available here.:)"
3,"Entertaining, but didn't think it merited the raves of other reviewers.","The dvd's are enjoyable, but for me, they didn't warrant the raves that the other viewers posted. Sweet and mildly funny, but that's about it for me."
3,Average,"I'm half way through wonderfalls, and am a little disappointed. With all the 5 star reviews it has received, i thought i'd be enjoying it more.I bought it because Tim Minear (angel, firefly) was involved, and also because of Bryan Fuller, whose previous show, dead like me, was quite good.Fuller's two shows have a bit in common- wacky characters, annoying music playing in every scene etc. However wonderfalls, unlike dead like me, is lacking in laughs. It's just not that funny. Nor are the characters that interesting or likeable. And the plots are a bit thin (even for a comedy).The idea was good, but it could have been a lot better."
2,What Is All The Fuss About?,"I watched 3 shows but was bored. The lead actress was annoying and while the writing was good, this show did nothing for me. I may need to watch it again."
2,Fourth Grade Entertainment,"This could be a decent TV series. For the most part, the characters are beleiveable.The story line, however, seemed to be vague and not realistic. Several plots that come to mind would be (1) shoplifting in the gift shop or (2) thwarting a terrorist attack on the Falls."
1,Missing discs,I ordered this item and received 2 copies of Disc 3 and was completely missing Discs 1 & 2. What use is a series when I'm missing 2 thirds of it?!?!?!Really bad quality assurance. Such a shame. Maybe try checking that the item contains what it should before sending.
3,Inconsistent,"The first episode deserves 5 stars, it was a wonderful start to a promising series. I have NO idea why FOX would pull a new show after just 4 episodes. Imagine SEINFELD's fate had it been a project at FOX. Would probably have lasted one season. Anyhooo, while production values on WONDERFALLS were high, and the acting fresh and powerful, the writing was inconsistent, which caused some episodes' premise to be highly unbelievable and even irritating, while others were absolutely great, funny, believable and wonder""fall""! I would have followed the second series on TV, had it continued."
4,Go boppin' along in a barrel...,"""Wonderfalls"" is (well... was, anyway) a terrific television program, one that I'm very happy to have discovered on DVD. Every episode in its short run delivered sharp writing, extreme cleverness, and lots of cool quirks, yet never at the expense of sacrificing real emotions and genuine heart. It was also refreshing to see a show set in a locale- in this case, Niagara Falls- not seen in a hundred other shows. Lots of playful extras, including a music video, interviews, and several commentaries, round out this very entertaining DVD collection."
4,Cute Movie,"Even though this generally appeals to pre-teen and teenagers, my husband and I watched it tonight on DVD and thought it was an upbeat, cute movie. Hannah goes back to her roots in Tennessee and finds some interesting old friends, and ultimately her true self. The music was fun, too. It wasn't the best movie I've seen, but it certainly wasn't the worst."
2,Had to Return,"I had to return this copy because in the description it says it came with the Hoe Down Throw Down walk thru. Much to my surpurse after ordering (while waiitng for it to arrive) I see a commercial that says only on Blue Ray. So I go online and try and figure things out, which I found I had to mail this back and order the blue ray version. I compared the two descriptions on Amaazon and they were IDENTICAL, so I fell it was a little false advertising. I had to pay to ship it back and get a new copy.....first time I was disappointed with Amazon."
5,Miley Cyrus grows up,The stuckup teen pop star finds that she needs to grow up and stop the Lindsey Lohan self-destructive behavior. She meets the challenge well and finds that adulthood requires truth. A very good coming of age comedic-drama. Worth owning for the movie part ... without the singing. Acting is much better than the tv show.
4,great family movie,"fantastic, very catchy music and happy ending. The movie is great and I really enjoyed watching it with my kids. They will watch it over and over again, just to learn the dance moves."
3,Hannah Montana,"My kids loved this movie, and it actually held my attention as well! No vulgarities, no nudity, no suggestive scenes. It was nice to watch a movie with my kids and not have to cover their eyes or turn off the movie halfway through."
5,good quality,"good quality, i loved this movie! good movie. i need more words to finish this review ok so thats good."
5,All my girls now have this movie!,Hannah had to grow up . . . think of more than herself and her career. The girls loved this movie and enjoy getting to watch it at home!
1,BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAADDDDD,It is the worst movie I've seen. No plot just anutro selfish jerk now have feelings movie. Why am I here anyway!!!!
5,Fantastic,"Saw this at the movies with my daughter who loves Hannah and has all the tv series released here in Australia. I love that the same type of storyline continues with the movie. It is good family entertainment, loved the Hoedown Throwdown and purchased the soundtrack from itunes after I saw the movie and it is a regular in the music selection for the house. If you like Hannah Montana then you will enjoy the movie."
5,Hannah Montana Movie,Great Movie -- kids loved it and even the adults were surprised and really liked it. Good music.
4,"audio, video cables","audio great, s-video ok, s-video at 4 feet much better than at 150 feet, these cables were almost $200.00 was just hoping for a little better picture"
4,different take on classic pilates,"Don't be afraid to try something new. This video takes exercises from the reformer and modifies them to be able to do on the mat without any equipment. The only exercise you might recognize is the hundred. Mostly every other exercise is a modified version of something originally done on the reformer. The exercises are definately challenging. However, there is too much time between poses. Before she starts each exercise, she shows what it looks like on the reformer. Dont get me wrong, you'll love need the rest. And you might actually enjoy seeing how the two compare. For really advanced users, there is a bonus workout where she cuts out all the demos and does the workout straight through! The regular workout is roughly 55 minutes long. The bonus workout is 35 minutes long. I recommend never doing the bonus workout, which is identical to the regular workout, without having done this video a few times first. Try for yourself!!"
4,like the real thing,I loved this pilates dvd. I have been to a pilates studio and with out having the machines at home to do pilates a lot of the exercises did very similar movements. It is a good work out and I do recommend this dvd. Enjoy.
1,definitely less than pilates,i've been following hillary burnett's advanced DVD for years and i love it. i bought this one to learn some new poses. completely disappointed. waste of money and time
5,Great artist,I've been already a fan of amplified. This single has 2 great songs that is favored by everyone.
5,just buy it already,"great book on instinctive shooting and a must for the newb whether it's a recurve or longbow i've rebought this book twice so that should tell you how valuable it is. Part two is also highly recommended once you've mastered the basics, even after shooting recurves for 30+ years i still need this book buy it"
4,Great compilation of classic toons!,"This is a pretty good video! I don't like all the toons though, which is why I'm rating it four stars instead of five. Like someone else mentioned, ""The Worm Turns"" is kind of an oddball among the other cartoons, which have a more lighthearted air to them. Overall though, this is great family entertainment because it has a diverse variety of cartoons that would appeal to different people, both kids and adults."
3,May not be ideal for a two year old!,"I bought this for my two year old nephew who loves Mickey Mouse & friends. However, after viewing it, I found it to be mostly older Mickey cartoons with (""un-pc"") images too scary for a toddler. This video may be great for adults who are looking for a blast from the past, but I ended up not giving it to my nephew and regret buying it at all (it's expensive!)"
4,Nostalgia City,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but this video, in a strange way, isn't really for kids - some of the shorts are so politically incorrect that they would never be made now, and you might want to view it before you hand it over to the kids.. But what a treat for adults who grew up with Mickey!Everyone will have their favorite, but I remember in particular watching ""Mickey's Trailer"" when Disney shorts ran on days off from school on minor holidays. Another highlight is ""The Band Concert"", which opens the tape - a classic of toon mayhem.One warning - I was looking forward to seeing ""Steamboat Willie"" for the first time and found to my shock that it is rather violent at points, especially the damage that Mickey inflicts on an unlucky cat. Adults who have had gardens ruined by other people's cats may appreciate the vicarious satisfaction - those with both impressionable kids and feline friends in the house may have other ideas."
4,Great starter collection for young kids.,"This is a great collection of cartoon shorts to introduce your young kids to Disney. These feature all the original Disney characters such as Mickey (of course!), Minnie, Pluto, Donald, Pete and Goofy.This video is not really for adult Disney collectors because credits are missing and there are no dates given for each short. The only real plus for collectors is the addition of ""Steamboat Willie"", Mickey's very first cartoon. This is really meant for the newer generations to see some of the old cartoons and discover Disney animation, though adults will enjoy watching this with or without the kids.If you are a real Disney collector or want to start being one, then I suggest you get a dvd player or dvd drive for your computer and buy a copy of Walt Disney Treasures ""Mickey Mouse in Living Color"" and ""Silly Symphonies"". The only drawback to the dvd, no ""Steamboat Willie"", which is in black and white."
4,Amazing What you Can get for 3 Bucks,"I don't have the knowledge of music to describe what is so great about this disc, but if you like the classics (Miles, Coltrane, Monk, Blakey, Mingus) and HATE smooth jazz, you should give this a try. He's all over the place at times, like Miles in his prime, but it WORKS. Some amazing meandering piano makes this a fantastic cd to own."
1,Complete disapointment,"I too have been a fan of Fiona Walker's books since first reading ""Snap Happy"" a few years ago. I have been waiting patiently for her latest work and could not wait to dive into ""Tongue in Cheek"". Initially, I had a difficult time getting into the story but I persevered. I am sorry to say that it did not get much better. I just could not empathize with any of the characters and was just glad I finally finished this extremely long (and at times confusing) book. While I would not recommend this particular book, I would certainly recommend some of her previous books like ""Snap Happy"" and ""Lucy Talk"". I'm not giving up on Fiona Walker just yet and look forward to her next novel."
2,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Fiona Walker, I have read French Relations, Well Groomed, Kiss Chase and loved them. For some reason, Tongue in Cheek missed the mark. Not only is it much too long, the characters and plot are for lack of a better term muddy. You get a general sense of a person, but not really how they think, what drives them, etc. It's just a miss and in my opinion a waste of time. I would not read this book again"
1,Unimpressive,"So Fiona Walker has always been a must read Author of mine. But seriously, this book was just rubbish. Way too many pages, way too many unnecessary characters and not nearly enough editing. Am relieved to have finished it. Unfortunately, I fear I will steer clear of future novels by this author."
1,I would give it no stars if I could...,"I'm not even going to attempt a review of Jean-Luc Godard's film Hail Mary (Je Vous Salue Marie) here. The DVD is of such bad quality that I could not watch it all and returned it to the store.As the reviews below point out there is nothing Digital about this release, it is a bad transfer of a VHS copy. How dare New Star Video sell this as a digitally remastered film! Shame on them for releasing such shoddy merchandise and taking our hard earned cash for it!"
1,A disgrace.,"I agree entirely with D. O. Hanlon. This DVD should be avoided. The picture quality is abysmal; looks like it's been transferred through a grey filter. The cast ""extra"" includes a tiny bit of information about Mieville's short, The Book of Mary, which precedes Godard's feature; there is nothing about Godard's film at all. I'm returning mine for a refund."
3,Still wonder,"A good movie from Goddard, not among the best though.Still wondering why it got censored, it's approach is very subtle."
1,Not worth watching,"This is one of the worst movies I ever watched. It was poorly produced, and the story is really poor. I really felt empty and stupid after having watched this movie. I was waiting (or hoping) for the movie to become more interesting, for the real story to start, and eventually the same poorly produced movie, just dragged on and on until the end. The story is almost non existent, and trying to get something out of this movie, is almost like trying to squeeze juice out of a dry orange.By the way, if you are buying this movie because you think you will see Juliette Binoche acting, forget it. She only appears a couple of times, and she does not even speak."
2,Not satisfied,The finishing is not clean. you can feel the rough edge on the handle. The chest is good but I did not buy it for the chest.Not sure why the list price is $....
5,Our Avatars of Compassion and Mercy,"I am most grateful to Michael Zwerdling, RN for the creation of this heart-felt tribute to the nursing profession. He has compiled a through and profoundly moving volume that details the history of nursing in a unique and beautiful manner. I could not help but be reminded of my own mother who was a dedicated nurse all her life.The images in this book speak volumes of the loving kindness manifest by nurses in their care for people in sickness, while injured and their tireless efforts at providing comfort. His tribute is an outstanding expression of appreciation for the active compassion of all nurses.Everyone who has a nurse in their family, or is the friend of a nurse, or who has benefited from the compassionate care of nurses while in hospital, might consider making a gift of this book to their favorite angel of mercy.This book is an incredibly beautiful tribute to all nurses, our avatars of compassion and mercy."
2,Where are the Emperors?,"The title of this book got my attention, since there has not been alot written on the Vietnamese Emperors, or anything other than the war with the US for that matter. However, this book only deals with ""The Last Emperors of Vietnam"" in the first chapter, devoting little more than a paragraph or two for some of the Nguyen monarchs. The rest deals with the Indochina War and the political fights leading up to the intervention of America. It costs alot for a very small book and has a very misleading title. There is some good information, but most of it does not have anything to do with Vietnam's last emperors."
5,WONDERFULL,This is a great book for all the persons that like to learn sewing. Is very easy to understand and is GREAT and usefull.
1,Missing Pages 8-19,Purchased this book for a sewing class in school didn't need the book right away so I didn't think to look to see if all the pages were there. Well I guess I will from now on. The pages that list all the equipment that you need and how to use it are missing from the book.
3,Same as Photo Guide book by this publisher.,"I was not very impressed with the information contained in this book. It started out with basic skills and jumped to advanced sewing. There was very little information for the average ability seamstress. Be aware that the book, ""New Sewing Essentials"" and ""The Complete Photo Guide to Sewing"" are by the same publisher and are virtually the same. Many identical photos and information."
4,Very good reference book,"This book includes basic and more advanced techniques. It is a practical book. I bought along with ""The Complete Photo Guide to Sewing"" and ""The new Step by Step Decorating Projects"" both from Singer also. Although there is repeated information from one book to the next, there is also additional information in each one. For example the ""Complete Photo..."" includes information found on this book AND int ""The new...Decorating Pr.."", but it also has addional information and projects. So it worked for me as adding more info as I kept advancing from one book to the next. In the end, you will end up with your own personal techiniques (what works for one person doesn't work for the other,) or simply because you can come up with your own ideas, but nontheless all three books are good to have, especially if you own a Singer Sewing maching."
5,The book I most recommend,I am a professional tailor and used to teach sewing. When people express an interest in learning the craft I ALWAYS recommend this book. It covers what you want to learn and the illustrations are easy to follow. I really like the section on tension problems because I think this is what discourages most beginners and is so easy to fix if you follow the illustrations. I am going to Africa this summer to teach tailoring to a community of women there and hope to be bringing many copies of this book because the illustrations are easy to follow even if you can't read the text. Thanks singer!
1,BAIT AND SWITCH,"If I could give zero stars, I could!I purchased this item as a housewarming gift for my friend who loves music. The description on amazon indicates:""Product FeaturesCreated from actual vinyl LP records with the original labels intactProtected with a clear mylar sealEach set includes 6 coasters in a wide range of artists/bands/music styles/genres/label colorsMade in the USAGift Wrap available at checkout""Naturally, I didn't open the box first because I didn't want my friend to receive an opened gift. As she opened it at her party, i was embarrassed to see that EVERY record/coaster was by the NOSTALGICS (band that doesn't exist) and the names of the songs were ""jokes"" to reference the fact that the coaster is a record. I was not amused. And I couldn't take the gift back - she said she ""loved it"" but I know that is all she could say.I would not buy from this vendor again!!! DEFINITELY not worth $20."
2,disappointed,love the idea but what showed up i can't use. all the songs were religios or about weddings. not cool at all. shame...they need to get some new vinyl!!
4,great,they look and feel great being that they are actual vynil records.... only problem is that you can't even pick with era you want music from so you can get records from all genres and eras.
4,Great idea but....,"I purchased these as a gift to be used in a game room. The idea of recyling LPs to make coasters is wonderful and the quality was good, however, I found that the labels were mostly neutral colors (tan, cream) and not the bright ones (reds, blues) shown in the picture. This made them look a lot less exciting. Otherwise, I was happy with them."
3,Didn't realize this item wasn't new.,"The coasters are nice, very good quality - I didn't realize they were used, however. Some of them had pen markings on them and the condition just wasn't what I expected for the price."
3,Unique - but disappointing,"These coasters are unique and quite a conversation piece. Great for a rec/game room. I was a little disappointed though as I ordered 2 sets and did not get the ones I saw advertised in both sets. They were completely different. Since I wanted a set for myself and an identical one to give away as a gift, this proved to be problematic."
5,Neat Conversation Item,"A friend wanted a set of coasters for Christmas, and I wanted to get him some that were unique. These came up when I did a search for coasters, and I thought they'd be perfect. They come in a nice plastic holder, and are laminated to protect against moisture. The labels you get are totally random, and the ones received in the set I purchased were from all different genres through the ages, which I think is a great conversation starter for parties since virtually everybody loves music. I would definitely recommend them when looking for a unique gift for friends and family alike."
4,Pretty Cool Idea,"I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I ordered these. I purchased them as a gift for a friend (we are both music lovers). Now that I actually have them, I want a set of my own. This is a unique idea! while you can't select your record labels, they do vary in color, design and musical type so that you get a very diverse range.Would be a plus if they were dishwasher safe."
5,Tiger Lite Delite,"Great pole!! Regardless of price this rod will outfish the more expensive ones.Striper, sturgeon, halibut ... any large fish is game with this unit."
5,excellent rod!,paired it up a 3500 level spinning reel and some 30lb braid. Held up like a champ. Landed 2 king mackerels and 1 sailfish over the weekend. great rod and nice feeling cork handle.
1,Never know it seemed nice before it broke.,Delivered as advertised. Placed in garage before fishing trip and my wife opened the door while it was leaning against door and the top snapped right off. It felt good before it broke. Was hoping it would have bent and not cracked.My fault.
2,Who puts these things together?,"Who in the world put this thing together. How can they put a box set together and miss so many hits and great album cuts. This reminds me of the Earth, Wind & Fire box set. The music is great, and I love these guys and their versatility, but this should have been 4 or 5 discs instead of 3 discs. I'm glad I've got most of the albums so that I won't miss so many good songs. It's very frustrating as a fan that we can't get every hit, isn't that why it is a box set and not a ""greatest hits"" package. The label probably does this so that you will buy the albums just to get the missing songs."
3,Good Collection- of the original songs !!!,"I recently purchased this CD, and while it is a good collection, there's a catch. The song that I bought it for, ""Voyage to Atlantis"" has been redone, and replaced with some in studio alternate version, that's not nearly as good as the original. there are 3 or 4 other songs like this too. I have no idea why the artists do this, unless they want to get the consumer soo frustrated that they eventually buy the original album.Other than this, its a good collection of their hits (except ""Pop That Thing""), which should be on there."
3,Disappointing,"I think this is a bit disappointing, considering, the great catalog of music, this has been taken from. Quite a few of the numbers are alternative versions. Also the playing order is a bit weird, for instance on the first disc, it starts out with some of their late fifties hits, then goes on to some of their late sixties funk stuff, and then at the end of the disc, suddenly some of their late fifities numbers like 'Rockin McDonald' and two other early numbers, crop up again. The same is true on the other discs, where for instance, late nineties tracks, are followed by late seventies tracks, that soundwise really clash. So with this one it's like the chance to make a really great compilation have been missed."
4,Nostalgic blend of everything,"I am a collector of R&B music. This is definitely one of the best Isley Brothers compilations; however I agree with an earlier reviewer that the arrangement of this compilation could have been more in synch within each individual decade of music. It is obvious that the tracks clash. Overall, it is a very entertaining and rich blend of pop, rock, soul, jazz and doo wop!"
4,"Sloppy Joe on the animation, great storyline","Bandai Entertainment has been well known for the Gundam series that they have brought to the United States. Please Teacher is a good sider for the well known giant robot franchise. It's got a great storyline that is comparable to Happy Lesson, except with one teacher. The plot is alright for the story, and the character development is on par with standards. The dubbing... however cute... is actually lackluster (at least the females). Whoever dubbed the main character, though, has done a good job. This is an anime executed perfectly for being a rush job (it seems as though the producers didn't take the time with the animation). Nice work!"
3,While A Reverse Lolita Style Anime It's Still Entertaining To A Point,"The series while pushing on a social taboo of a teacher student romantic/sexual relationship doesn't push the scenes in the series more then to PG17, with the exception of the last episode which goes close to passing the R rating for a few minutes. The series is for the most part comedic with the standard lanky somewhat bumbling but talented young male high school student who through various scenarios and situations becomes involved with a attractive young high school teacher with her own secrets and agendas. The series will also give you the standard fan service but doesn't saturate you as much as you would think with this series, the voice cast for the subbed did very well but sadly it was at most 50/50 with the English dubbed. So while enjoyable for what it is if you find offensive the subjects disturbing then this series is one you should probably pass over."
1,Please Teacher,By far this was the lousiest movie I have every watch of Anime. Please do not buy this item it really is a waste of money if you are looking for reguler amine movies with sex. This movie really should be taken off the Adults only viewer list or trashed completely is the best place. A 2 hour movie with bad scripted and confussing scenes.
4,Looks great,"I havent bought this item yet but i will soon my personal opinion is that it looks great ive wanted this series for about six months but havent taken the time and money to oder it, and now i cant wait. I will be posting a new review after purchase."
4,Good stuff...,My girl loved it... I enjoyed it... and was even moved at the end...I seem to see this recurring theme in the anime I have picked up lately...Girl effects a youthful boy. Boy grows into a man and has forgotten about it. Boy has an epiphany and discovers the value of Girl.Pretty simple plot but executed pretty well... I liked it...
3,"Third Single off of ""Heathen Chemistry"" is Just Average","After the terrific singles ""The Hindu Times"" and ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"", Oasis really makes a curious choice for its third single of the ""Heathen Chemistry"" album. This is a so-called ""double A-sided"" single, with ""Little by Little"" and ""She is Love"" being the ""double As"".Both ""Little by Little"" and ""She is Love"" are Noel-penned and sung, and are average MOR ballads, at best. A much better choice for single IMHO would have been ""Born on a Different Cloud"", one of the album's best songs (it also would be the first Liam-written song to chart on its own). The redeeming track on this single is Oasis' take on The Who's ""My Generation"", which has been part of Oasis' live set the past year.For those that already have the album, no need to buy this single, unless you just can't live without having ""My Generation"". For those that don't have the album, don't buy this single but buy the album instead!"
1,not for bread makers,"I bought this book doing a search with two phrases, whole grain and bread machine. The book promises to easily convert her recipies from oven to bredmachine. She only gives a few pages that vaguely tell to modify the recipies, but not ecactly how. Judging from previous reviews, this book must have some merit. It is not for a bread machine owner that likes simple and direct instructions."
1,Ok-lots of INFO,"Most of the recipes are pretty complex. This is definitely for the a more advanced ""baker""."
4,THE whole-grain bread book,"If you're committed to baking whole-grain bread, it would be hard to imagine a better book. The Laurel's Kitchen people present a wide range of recipes that, if followed carefully, will give you first-rate whole grain bread.I'd especially recommend the book for the novice bread-baker. The introductory instructions are very detailed, helpful, and easy to follow.I wish that the authors had emphasized slow-fermentation techniques more than they do: in my opinion, the slow-rise approach is the only way to get the best flavor out of whole-grain breads. In fact, the back of the book contains a very good collection of slow-rise techniques, but first-time users of the book aren't likely to find them.Whole-grain bread, properly made, is the best bread there is; if you want to make it right, get this book!"
5,Bread,This book is terrific. The recipes are easy to follow and let you know just what to do when. It also has a great section on bread machines. You can now make reasonably good whole grain bread in a machine. I also loved the section on making a starter. I've been looking for a good starter and now have found one.
2,Forget the Bread Machine,"I purchased this book because it offered a chapter on Bread Machines. Well, it does offer a chapter on bread machines. The advice? Keep a notebook and experiment. This advice I didn't need to pay for. I'm still looking for a bread machine cookbook for home-milled grains."
4,Great bread cookbook,The whole grain breads I have made from the recipes in this book have turned out very good--they are light in texture and tasty. Good beginner instructions; but also offers recipes for the established baker looking for something more creative.
5,The Vittle Vault is Great,"The Vittle Vault is the best product I purchased in all of 2005. The dry dog food I buy has some moisture in it and it would dry out when left in the bag. I had been trying lots of things to keep it from drying out. I tried storage bins but they are not air tight. I tried putting press and seal plastic wrap on the storage bins. Nothing worked. I finally found the Vittle Vault and I am thrilled with it. After telling a neighbor, she bought one too because she keeps her dry dog food on her screened porch and the ants would get in it. She says, no more ants. (I keep my dry dog food in the kitchen.) I bought the 30 lb size and it easily holds my 20 lb bag of dog food when it's still a quarter full. I really like pouring the whole bag in at once and throwing the big bag away. This is a great product."
3,Bought two..One defective,"Bought two, one holds 20 pounds of kibble easily, and has a nice seal. Second one was smaller (about 10-12 pounds of kibble) and the raised portion of the screw down inside had a 3-4 inch fracture at the threading surface. Looked closely at both Vittle Vaults and the quality of the molding process leaves something to be desired. Both showed holes where the plastic mold had been removed that I fear will end up cracking over time. Love the concept, just think I will continue to look for a better product!"
2,Not squirrel proof and hard to open,The recessed grip in the center makes getting the lid off difficult and the squirrels chewed through it in a day.
1,Very little helpful content,"This book was a great dissapointment. I feel ripped off, because buying such a book with CD led me expect much more indepth information and tricks from professionals than this book contains. Half of the book describes the build of a drum - everyone looking at a drum for 5 minutes learns this by himself. Then, for every drum a whole page is wasted to describe how to put the head on the shell - why? the process is similar on every drum. Exactly the same happens with the description of streching the head. No info at all is given what influences the torsion of the snare wires have on the overall sound. No mention of tuning the two heads of a drum in relation to each other. In summary, this book has no value to a drummer with an experience of 3 months or more. There are much better ressources."
3,This book is ok for the beginning drummer,"This book covers the basic tuning principles for the beginning drummer. This book is reccomended for the begginer only, who has not tuned a drumset before. The included CD isn't much help."
5,LOVE this CD,This music puts me in the mood for an amazing Yoga practice. I'm a Yoga teacher and I'm always looking for new music to use...I hit the bullseye with this one. My students love it as well. Great for relaxation and meditation.
1,Sound but NO PICTURE!,"I bought this unit a few months ago for $35. It worked for a while and then all of the sudden in the middle of a movie the picture just went out. So now, I can still play videos/CDs and listen to the sound - but I cannot SEE anything on the screen!I guess you get what you pay for. Maybe they should market this unit as a ""disposable DVD player"" and knock 10 bucks off the price!Oh yeah, one other VERY annoying thing about this unit is that there is a VERY BRIGHT BLUE LIGHT that flashes when a movie is not playing. You have to turn the power COMPLETELY OFF to make the light stop flashing. The remote control will not turn the power completely off either (designed this way for some reason) so you have to manually go over to the unit and push the power button to make the darn thing stop flashing.I guess it's not a HUGE deal, but when you're lazy and spoiled like me and you're used to everything being controlled from a single remote - it gets annoying after a while."
1,crap,"this thing is garbage, i got it and it didnt work from the get go, it opened for me 1 time, and played a movie, i just checked to see if it was working, when i went to go use it, it would not open, it is garbage! dont buy!"
2,PAL problems,"I bought this DVD player because it supposedly played PAL DVDs as well as NTSC, and the price was right. It's a terrific player, BUT it doesn't seem to play all PAL disks. It worked for some, but not for others."
1,Toss it in the garbage,"Got this gem from a local store a few months ago. The HD output never worked (Y, Cb, Cr). Slow response and loud. Do not buy anything from jWin. You get what you paid for. Save your time and eyes and get a Sony."
1,Sucks Big Time,"Order this dvd player for my friend to use in their dorm room as a gift, along with some DVD's.When they finally open it and hooked it up, it said read and than no disc..I am totally disgusted with this product..do not buy it, it is a waste of your money and than your time having to mail it back.The instruction do not tell you what everything is for and there is nothing saying how long it is warranted for by the company.Never again if you see JWin on a product run...."
4,industrial roots come out on this project,"I originaly got into mortal because of thier industrial edge - uncommon in Christian music. This album really shows off some of that edgy side again. With heavy guitars, and lots of crazy stuff going on - its definately pushing the edge a bit.The songs arent as musical or melodic, but the lyrical depth is all there just like what weve come to expect from the crew.This album is rich."
1,Not what I expected,"Not a book about quilting at all. There's a possum on the cover too, I mean come on! Not interesting."
2,for the fans' interest,"This CD is directed towards serious Tiger Army fans. It a collection of some earlier Tiger Army recordings. It is certainly not as good as the other CDs, but it is not intended to be. It is more for the interest of the fans than for those with a more casual interest in the band.If you do not have the other CDs, get those first. They show the true capabilities of Tiger Army. But, if you have a strong interest in the band and are familiar with the other CDs, I recommend buying this CD."
4,Good CD,"Well this is a good ep, but the cover of american nightmare was not that great. i expected more. the other songs were great and it was worth the buy. enjoy."
4,Good CD,Well this is a good cd but the cover of american nightmare by the misfits wasn't all that great. but other than that it was a good cd. they have old songs on there from other albums but they are the demo virsion. but this album is worth the by. enjoy.
3,A fun and unexpected romance,I began watching this film and initially found it disappointing. But I couldn't stop watching. It soon became more interesting when the characters began to unfold exposing a few surprises. Not a particularly sophisticated film but as it turned out a fun love film.
4,"Great, swinging CD from hard-hitting tenor player","This is a very swining, big fun, straight-ahead album. Alexander plays with a big tone with lots of Dexter influence and swings very hard. The rhythm section really cooks, especially veteran pianist Harold Mabern, whose energetic and active comping gives the group a very full sound. Solos from Mabern feature left hand independence that makes you wonder how many people are sitting at the piano. The version of Bewitched in an up-temp 6/8 is burning. This album was definitely worth my money, and prompted me to go get more of Eric Alexander's records."
4,good product,"i got the item really quik, it works great and the video is of good quality. the box is new never used before!"
3,"Predictable plot, good characters","Judd Lassetier is your typical anti-hero, attractive to the heroine because of his faults, not despite them. One thing that I am really sick of in these Indian romance novels is the frequent and unecessary use of the term ""Half-breed"". Now I know that someone out there is going to try to tell me that it is historically acurate to use that term, and I agree, in the context of the novel it may sometimes be required. However, why do the authors and publishers use this all over the dust jackets? It's a very offensive term that these authors who claim to respect the native peoples of this land should use carefully. That said, I like the hero and heroine's characters a lot, but in the last third of the novel the author seems to be struggling to keep these two from getting to know each other as individuals as well as keeping them apart romantically. I reccomend this book if you like Indian romance and want a change from the kidnapped white-woman thing."
4,Good Linux Reference,"One problem with Linux books is that they get outdated rapidly. I think that this is more resistant to that than most. Another problem is that the Linux documentation is scattered all over the Internet. This collects it in one book that you can sit down and refer to. This book is intermediate to advanced. There is no hand holding or tutorials here. For example there is 36 pages on bash (Bourne Again Shell). 734 pages on utility programs, such as bash. 153 pages on system calls - for programmers. 171 pages on library functions - for programmers, etc. The reason it is rated only 4 stars is that any such book is inherently outdated."
1,Book is too dated. Covers Linux Redhat 4.1 ;=(,"It arrived yesterday and is headed back today. Don't bother. Get Unleashed 5.2 or wait for the 6.0 version if you are using with RedHat. If not, the book may be of some use..."
1,"It is just a print out of ""man"" command !","You can get this book for free if you typed man+""command"" in Linux window."
5,Genius writers hits the spot,"Love, Love, Loved it! I didn't see my kids for two days while watching the season 3 series of Friday Night Lights (I actually faked a migraine so I could lock myself in my bedroom and watch the last 2 episodes in peace).The performances alone were enough to hook me, every character resonated with me and reminded me of someone I know because they're all so real. The relationship between the coach and his wife Tammy feels so authentic I wonder if they have a relationship in 'real life' and both of their relationships with their daughter Julie inspire me to be a better mum and really get to know my kids as human beings.This brilliance of this series really comes down to the genius of the writers. The dialogue (which is delivered with perfection) is true and pure and really hits the spot, I cried, I laughed and I loved with these characters. I really invested my emotions in it and I can't wait to watch season 4."
5,FABULOUS...THE BEST SHOW ON TV...IT's NOT JUST FOOTBALL,"If you've missed this show, I highly recommend that you buy season 1 and I can promise you that you will immediately order 2 & 3. The characters are wonderful and the show is true to life. It's well written and the acting is superb. You'll get addicted to this show...it's truly the best."
4,Addictive show,"I started watching this series with my son because he plays football and it seemed like something I could tolerate. Forget tolerate- I can't turn it off. It is a little bit of a soap opera, but the characters are well-written. At the end of each episode, my son and I look at each other and usually agree to watch "" just one more."""
5,Great show,Wonderful show! Character depth and development is incredible. So sorry it took me so long to find. Wish it wasn't off air.
2,Not a _practical_ introduction,"I selected Pyle's book, sight unseen, as an introduction for undergraduate students in an information science curriculum. A third the way through the course students are beginning to ask ""where's the beef?"", and understandably so. Even a business reader in search of an overview of the topic will likely find this discussion weighted with waffling wordiness.The author devotes page after page to talking about models and mining in a style that is somehow both wordy and imprecise. A reader who is interested in the author's feelings about modeling and mining might find it illuminating; students who are interested in learning how it works and how to _do_ it find it unsatisfying.I recommend the next edition edit the first 300 pages or so down to 30, and devote the word-count more to real life examples, specific mathematical explanations, and practical exercises."
4,ES UN BUEN LIBRO INFORMATIVO SOBRE EL ANTIGUO TESTAMENTO,"Ciertamente he leído este libro al principio con placer y entusiasmo. Sin embargo, me di cuenta que es un libro más bien de referencia histórica, pero muy significativa, particularmente si fue escrita por un prestigioso escritor como Isaac Asimov, que tiene la habilidad de llamar atención al lector hacia temas poco explorados, a través de investigaciones históricas y arqueológicas que están a su disposición y las analiza muy bien. Además, las Biblias en que se basa el libro son en su mayoría de versiones inglesas, por lo que se pierde algo de la anterior originalidad (una labor difícil para los traductores). Pero ante todo, es un buen libro de referencia histórica, escrito por un escritor que conoce las intenciones del curioso lector."
5,Hermit crab,I ordered this toy for my grand daughter's fifth birthday as she loves sea creatures.She told me that it was her favourite birthday present even though she received a digital camera.She loves this toy and takes it everywhere with her.It is durable and lifelike.
4,Hermit Crab,My 5 year old grand daughter Loved this. So realistic. Think she thought it was the real thing. It's her first pet.
3,not the best budget release,"I suspect this is another budget collection of the 90's rerecordings of her hits that she did. I don't own this one, but anything not on the MCA/UNI label is most likley the new recordings. Which are good songs and good quality, produced by Owen Bradley.This does seem like a waste of disc space since they could all fit on disc, but the price is good for 20 songs."
4,Music My Pet is music for Me,"To help keep my dog ""company"" during the day I purchased Music My Pet CD. The classical arrangements are simple and never get old. I put my CD player on repeat when I leave and trust my pooch is comforted by the special music. Since I'm not here to observe him, I really don't know if it helps him feel good. But I can tell you this: Coming home to this soothing music makes ME instantly feel more relaxed... at which point my pooch grabs a toy and dances around, happy to welcome me home."
4,Music my Pet,"Good selection of music,peaceful,quiet; my pets are calmer when we play it.:) We play it on a loop when we are out of the house or busy working on things while we are home."
5,This CD worked our border collie:,"We have a border collie mix that goes through periods of being hyper. We had her in the car for a long ride and we popped in this CD to see if she would respond. This definitely mellowed her out. In fact, I think it mellowed me out too. I'd recommend this to anyone in need of some soothing music."
5,Calming the Savage Beast,"I've just received my Classic Cuts. I'm getting my puppy in three days and this music has CALMED his mother(me) already. I'm sure it will have the same effect on my 3mth old puppy.Thanxp.s. The shipper was extraordinary in getting my order to me in SPEEDY TIME w/o any extra cost. Thanx againp.p.s. My puppy, Miguel, has arrived and he is only 2 1/2mths old. He is a tiny thing & even with the poundingon the roof of my apt., he is laying calmly on the floor. Can't wait for the Winter Version :)"
2,NEEDS TO BE MORE RAW & LESS PRODUCED .,"I HEARD HER ON A LOCAL RADIO SHOW AND IT WAS JUST HER AND AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR ; IT WAS AWESOME . THIS CD WAS NOT AS ""LOW KEY "" AS I EXPECTED . HER VOICE ON THE CD WAS NOT AS I REMEMBERED IT FROM THE RADIO SHOW . TOO MUCH PRODUCTION RUINED THIS FOR ME ."
5,A Masterpiece.,"I don't have enough words to communicate to you the energy, craft and passion that Toshi Reagon puts into this album. It's one of the best I've heard in the last several years -- the range of genres she builds upon is breathtaking, mixing rock, blues, gospel, 70s soul, and just about everything else. Her songwriting and performances are both moving on an emotional level, and high-energy enough to get your feet moving too! ""Real Love"" is an immediate standout, but virtually every song here has something to recommend it. Those who know about this album or who have caught her live are lucky indeed."
3,Darling,"Although I don't feel as strongly about the rest of the album, ""Darling"" is a heartbreaking masterpiece. Yes, you've felt this way, and if you haven't, I'm sorry."
3,...a nice escape.,"It takes a little while to get going, but relatively speaking for an 800 page book it is a quick read.When you're swept away to Faerie it's a great escape from the real world, so if you're into being taken to a magical place; you'll be into this book!Sometimes Tad Williams writing is a little hard to follow, though you're never lost for too long."
4,A different kind of fantasy,The War of the Flowers takes classic fantasy and gives it a modern twist. Read this and your idea of fairyland will never be the same. Imagine Frodo Baggins appearing in a Gangsta movie and you'll almost be there. The characters are alive and the storyline eventually gets moving. My only issue with this book is that too much time is spent developing the background of our hero; get through that and you will have an enjoyable read.
3,"Not his best, but...","Unlike many of the reviewers, I loved both the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn fantasy trilogy as well as the Otherland Series. I was amazed at the world he created, the references, and the originality of Otherland. War of the Flowers was a bit of a releif to have contained in one volume, an interesting fantasy. It was not his best, but somehow, I could not put it down either. I was drawn into the world and wanted to know the outcome, despite feeling that the characters were shallow,the main character adolescent, the ""love story"" a a bit creepy (the justifications used by both characters sounded a bit like those used by pedophiles), and the storlyine re-hashed. The whole thing felt rushed, and yet, the world he builds was more intersting than some. I'm glad I didn't purchase it, but got it from the library. I am hoping for more from the next series."
3,Beautifu Flowers Sometimes Wilt,"The book reads like two different novels. I enjoyed it overall, but I was never once sucked in to the world. The first 100 pages or so deal with Theo's unfortunate life. They were well-written and engaging. However, once he gets transported to the fantasy world, things just go crazy and I never feel as though I am reading about the same character. The world is like a mix of Who Framed Roger Rabbit/Neverending Story/Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The world is creative, interesting and dark. The characters are pretty interesting as well (especially Applecore, Tinkerbell gone dirty).I was never engaged enough to keep the pages turning hour on hour. But it was good. It, at times, got bogged down on too many details. And for this type of book, it would have been better served being around 500 pages instead of 800. He could have done it. In between the lines it is a good story filled with great, satyrical imagination."
3,Solid but not great.,"The major problem with this book is that I did not really care about the characters. If you really like the protagonists and hate that antagonists, it can make up for a lot of faults in a book. When plot and setting are solid but the characters are lackluster, its just another book."
3,Choking on Detail,I started off this novel thinking I was really enjoying it. The plot is excellently told throughout most of it and the characters are unique and interesting. But the paragraphs were too long and offered too much description. The prose just became so terribly verbose I could not handle it any longer and began to skim through the end. It was a genius story but could have been cut by 100-200 pages by not trying to force-feed us his vision of every little detail. In novels an author can either starve you or choke you with description. Williams definitely can choke you with too much detail.
5,Classic fantasy from Tad Williams,"An epic, stand alone fantasy story. (unlike most of the genre today, that seem to be published in the form of trilogies)After a somewhat slow beginning, this novel really picks up speed as it twists and turns its way to a very good conclusion. Like with most great fantasy writing, it has an abundance of magic, betrayals, creatures and people with special talents, love, unexpected friendships and above all an superb story line.I particularly liked the quality of Williams' prose in this book; it had that wonderful ability to sweep me into the story and keep me reading late into the night. Even though the novel was 800+ pages (paperback) I was sorry to see this extraordinary tale come to its end.Fantasy writing at its near best! 5 Stars."
5,the best i have read in years,"i go through fiction like some people go through chocolate (1,000 pages a week or more) and this is the best sence tolken. a man (at lest so he thinks)living the life of could have been great but going no where has a fairy and a walking corpes show up in one night and is swept into a world he dose not know with people he can not trust every were he turns and himself the focal point for a multy house war! and that is only the beginning. highly reccomend this book for action, plots, a litle side line romance and never knowing what will hapen next."
2,"WOW, I CAN""T BELIEVE I READ THE WHOLE THING...","This was painful, but after 500 pages I marched on. My reward was saying I finished the book. Williams can sure write, but there was no character I even cared about. The story is dull, long, and uneventful. Next to Outerworld this is a red headed step child."
2,Very disapointed,"What is with writing characters that are so annoying and obnoxious? I had very hard time finsihing this book. It was by no means the worst book I've read and Tad is a clever writer but I found myself disliking the lead and his little fairy companion and it made it hard for me to give a damn.Admittedly it got better near the end but the first half of the book was so damn hard to read..why can't writers make a character likeable, I understand the whole anti-hero thing but I just do not find it appealing!"
3,about 400 pages too long,"I have never struggled to get through a book as much as I did with this one. I wondered how you could make a book that contained magic, fairies, goblins, brownies, and just about every other fantasy cliche so boring, but I think that this author has managed to do that. The book was also way too long, with the author describing things in metaphors and similes to the point of exhaustion. It seemed like he couldn't get through one description of scenery or a character's reaction or action without referencing it to something in the mundane ""real"" world. I have nothing against an author being descriptive if it's part of keeping the story flowing at a good pace, but in this book the over-wordy descriptions really slowed down the pace of the book and painfully dragged it out. Rather than torture yourself with this book, I would recommend his To Green Angel Tower books instead. They are much more exciting, faster-paced, and shorter."
2,how disappointing,"I know there is no way Tad Williams fans won't buy this book, but I would highly suggest borrowing it from the library or a friend.With such an interesting topic as fairlyland in the modern era it's difficult to believe how poor this books was. The plot was weak and extraordinarily predictable. The characters were lackluster and in general appeared as little more than watery shadows of other characters Williams had already created. It was a very uninspiring read.Williams is typically such a good author, but I guess everyone has their worst work."
3,Disappointing Stumble in Emma Bull's general direction,"If Tad Williams was going to homage Emma Bull's vastly better ""War for the Oaks"", with its more evocative setting and its thrilling reinvention of fae mythos, he might have at least given her some credit (Theo does mention Minnesota in one of his first paragraphs, but that's not quite enough). The problems with this book: 1) individually the fae are believable characters, but their world is an Addams Family cliche that is consistently disappointing and unoriginal, 2)Theo isn't substantial enough to hang this book on, 3) Williams has never learned to finish a story in a way that is worthy of his elaborate and often breathtaking set-ups (see the last two volumes of Otherland).Read Emma Bull's books, esp. the fae-filled ""Finder"" and ""War for the Oaks"", but also the incredible ""Bone Dance"" (if you can still find it). These satisfy and startle in ways that William's effort doesn't."
3,Not original and not as entertaining as I'd hoped...,"I picked this book up along with Watt-Evans's _Dragon Weather_ for a recent vacation. The other book was captivating, this one wasn't.For starters, this book felt a lot like a retread of other, better, novels. Another reviewer mentioned _War for the Oaks_, which is the one I immediately thought of as well. That's a much better book. But the parallels aren't that exact. Williams has done a couple of semi-original things here and I did end up reading the whole thing after reaching a point early on where I didn't want to read it. The sense of wonder about traveling to a sort of modernized fairyland is sorely missing, but the story does move right along. The ending is terrible--Williams gets his hero out of a difficult jam while he (and we the readers) are unconcious. Arg!One last note: the hero in this book is a numbskull, which I find rather tedious.This is an okay read, but not Williams's best work."
2,Two hundred pages in...,"... and I still didn't care about anyone in this book. I put it down and haven't picked it up again.All of the characters just felt flat. We've got the struggling artist who just doesn't fit in anywhere, the fiesty sidekick, the incompetent aristocrat, a couple of mysteriously evil villains, and none of them feel real.The take on the world of fairy is interesting, but it's not enough to carry a story filled with soulless characters."
3,The frame is not real wood,"It's a fine cork board, especially for the price. However, based on the description of the product and some of the reviews, I thought that the frame was real wood. It isn't."
3,Okay for the price but not as advertised,"This cork board arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I peeled off the clear plastic label on the front of the frame and the ""oak"" came off with the label. The frame is really cardboard covered with paper printed to look like oak. The frame looked great until that happened. If you want real oak, buy something else. If you get this one, don't peel off the label.I probably would have given it four stars, but I'm not a fan of false advertising."
3,corkboard review,"We liked the size of this board. However both times the boards arrive cracked. The first time it was delivered,It was cracked right down the middle . We called the company and they sent us a new one immediately at no extra cost and no hassles. The second one came and there was a crack in it too but not as big and not as obvious as the first one. Next time we want a corkboard, we are going in town to buy one on sale.."
4,cork board,"Product is very good, however packaging was not so good. One corner of the board was chipped, but I taped it. I'm using it for a model railroad board, so it doesn't matter, but you might want to take note of it."
1,Do not buy,"This bulletin board is very poorly made, the wooden frame is held on by glue that started to come apart two days after I bought it. Also, when I unwrapped the package when it first arrived, there was already a crack down the middle."
4,Great for study/den,"Bought this for use for a) pictures,b) mementos. Nice board, it is now covered with pics, always in use.Probably will buy more for office use."
2,Beginner workout that isn't too challenging,"As all of the Pilates studios in my area require a large part of my rent to attend, I decided to venture out and buy a couple of Pilates DVDs instead.More than Mart Pilates is an easy, gentle workout. The exercises don't really incorporate the benefits of the reformer, and while the instructor frequently emphasizes that the aim is repetitions, not exhaustion, you might find your mind wandering off and wishing for something a bit more challenging.Having taken classes, I luckily knew of modifications to many of the exercises to make them more challenging. But, if your only access to Pilates is these DVDs, check out some (free) Pilates websites and use their modification tips. Or, simply purchase a more challenging DVD - this one fails to live up to the hype."
2,Not really mat pilates,"I've done mat pilates for at least 2 years. This video is not really mat pilates. This is also really slow and some of the moves I felt were easy for intermediate. The only thing I remotely liked for me was the cardioflow part. This video is not bad for someone starting out, but not for me."
4,gentle means of stretching the neck and back,"I'm 5'5"" and don't have a particularly long (or short) torso, and the size works ok for me. I'm using this as part of my regimen to rehabilitate my back. You start out resting on this for 5 minutes, then increase by a minute a day until you get to 20 - 30 minutes. This is what the instructions say, which differs from the add that says 15-20 minutes. I like that this gently stretches the spine and neck. I think it could be cheaper for what you get, it's basically just a foam piece with a fabric cover. You are supposed to relax on it, not multi-task by watching TV at the same time. The instructions also say that it's not designed to sleep on. My experience is that it's not particularly comfortable, but this is to be expected because stretching in general isn't all that comfortable. It does get more comfortable with continued use. This seems to suggest that it does make the spine more limber."
4,Great jazz educator in a set of fine preformances,"Long-time educator Goodrich taught jazz artisits such as Booker Little, Charles Lloyd and Harold Mabern in Memphis. On this CD he joined by Maburn or James Williams on piano, Buster Williams(bass) and Billy Hart(drums). Eddie Henderson(trumpet) makes an excellent fifth member on several cuts, his contributions are a real plus. Goodrich's tart alto reminds me a little of another former student Frank Strozier."
1,DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT CREAM RINSE FROM SHAMPOO,I ACCIDENTALLY PURCHASED CREAM RINSE INSTEAD OF SHAMPOO. THE DESCRIPTION COULD BE BETTER SO YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING.
4,Fifteen Years Underwater,"Sherman's Lagoon has been around for fifteen years and this giant treasury brings the latest strips and some reprints with Sundays in full color. Sherman and they gang are up to their usual tricks and some of the various story arcs include:The speed reading contestThe trip to the GangesHawthorne's Lagoon tour, coffe shop, health club, casino, bakeryThe mystery of dead RoscoeSherman's talk showMegan's babyThe Scotland tripBarnacle the purple arthropodAnd many more. So join the sharks, turtles, crabs and polar bear in a tropical paradise where walk on characters seem to get eaten very often."
1,Beware! Bad Print!!,"In spite of the running time on the package (120 min.), this is in fact a severely cut version, running 67 minutes. I had hopes of a version more complete than the 83 minute version with Dutch subs that I already own. The first murder (that of Judy Geeson's sister) is completely missing - an important plot item! Other cuts have been made, particularly to the small amount of nudity in the film. Too bad, because the quality is quite good for such an obscure movie."
2,"What ""Happened at Nightmare Inn""????","Not really sure what ""it"" was that happened at ""Nightmare Inn"", but the lovely Judy Geeson is the only reason to make an reservation at this ""Inn""!!"
4,Want Some Wine With That?...,"Two hyper-religious sisters run an inn. They seem very nice and accomodating to their guests. No one realizes that the two are quite insane, judgemental, and homicidal! They've made it their mission to do away w/ those they consider sinful, and that's just about everyone! Ghoulishly fun!..."
1,Bummer,"Being a huge Liquid Soul fan I couldn't wait to get my hands on this CD. However, I was VERY disappointed, as this disc is not in the same league as their previous releases. Their first three discs are some of the best in the genre, and are loaded with inspired jazz funk. By comparison this release feels watered down and contrived. Liquid Soul has been the best of class when it comes to funky, soulful, crank it up and party jazz. I hope they return to their roots with their next release."
1,"Should have been titled ""De-Evolution-1/2 Star Performance""","Being a huge Liquid Soul fan, I was extremely disappointed to find that there wasn't a single track on this CD that stood above the rest.This album is sub-standard LS at best. Even the MC's they brought into the studio for a couple of tracks lacked the style and intensity we've come to enjoy on earlier works. Gone are the infectious groove liques and sampling that defined ""Make Some Noise"" and ""Here's the Deal"" as two of my all-time favorite albums. I can only hope they'll ""Re-Evolve"" back into the band they once were."
4,"Easy to follow instructions, but can be improved","The step-by-step instructions are easy to follow. It would have been better if the authors had given guidelines on how to judge when to move on to the next phase of recovery, and how to deal with feelings that arise at each stage."
5,So much better than I could have ever imagined,"I didn't think that people would be able to understand me or my eating disorder. I mean, I didn't even understand it very well myself. But with every page I turned in this book, I found myself going ""wow, that is exactly me!"" If you haven't yet, this book will make you realize that it's really not you, it's this textbook disease called bulimia. But I think the most important thing this book has made me realize is that binging and purging has always given me a short-term escape that's kept me coming back again and again, but in the long-term, it's taken everything from me. Please, if you are considering recovery, pick up this book. It's written by people who clearly DO understand what bulimics go through. Good luck, and remember that there is no such thing as a ""last time"" or ""just one time"" when it comes bulimia (or any other addiction)."
5,Book review,This a great book for anyone in any stage of recovery. I have used it with many of my patients and they have all gotten a lot out of it.
3,Changed formula?,"I have used B&B for years-- this last bottle was not the same. Much wetter, and not as effective. Given its outrageous cost, I will not be buying again."
2,Just average,Nice gift box. However the pretzels were waxy with not a whole lot of flavor. Disappointed because there are a lot of good sugar free products out there. This is not one of them.
5,Another Fantastic Edition of Spectrum,"I just received my copy of Spectrum 8 today and it was well worth the wait. Beginning with the Grand Master Award for ""Moebius"", and going into the Year in Review, which I like to read because it points out other books or items that I might have missed. The rest of the book is divided into 7 sections covering artwork from Advertising, Books, Comics, Dimensional, Editorial, Institutional and Unpublished. Each section begins with the Gold and Silver award winners for that division and then the rest of the section contains 1 to 4 pieces of artwork per page, with each section contianing between 12 and 40 pages of artwork. The book ends with an artist index that gives contact information for them. Overall this is a great book (as is the rest of the series), and I look forward to seeing many more editions come out."
4,Spectrum 8,"I love this series, they are a bit spendy if you buy them as they come out, but they have a huge amount of current art technique, and represent the best in the genre."
5,Inspirational,"Like all of the ""Spectrum,"" books, this one delivers. Displaying some of the world's best fantasy and sci-fi art in every medium, from simple black ink to hand-painted sculpture, every image is beautifully reproduced in a book of excellent quality. If you are a collector of art, an artist who occasionally needs a little help to get inspired, or a serious fan-boi, this book is a must-have for your library."

1,TOO HARD to PEDAL,"We were excited to see this toy online for such a great price-$30 less than in store. When we got it and put it together for our 5 year old for christmas, we were so disappointed but not as much as he was and still is. It is hard to pedal and we can't get it to pedal easier. It is a waste of money and we won't buy anything made by this company again, ever. We were reluctant to buy from the internet because of all the shipping and etc and now we are doubly sorry. It sits in the back yard and will likely never be ridden. If you buy this, buy it in store and make sure you try it out with your child, it is hard to pedal."
3,Looks good but may not be durable,"This tricycle is somewhat heavy for kids age 4-5 years old. also, on February 10th the front bar that steers the wheels broke at the joit of the right wheel. had to have it welded by a friend. there is no adjustable seat for smaller kids."
3,"OK nothing great but not bad, fair","well the car is nice design sleek i was looking for something that could do some downhill racing, one time while riding down my street i went over 10mph riding a plastic little tike car, it was tiny and fun, and i may just buy this car, i recommend it to others"
3,Running out of Steam,Season seven is up and down on the comedy end. Like so many shows this far along and losing some of the cast just kind of die. They where some of the greatest and season seven still has its moments.
4,Solid Season,"Wings-Season 7 is one of the better seasons of Wings. Wings is not at the caliber of Seinfeld or Will and Grace as far as wit and timing, but it is still an enjoyable and comforting comedy."
3,Great show but this season started a downward sprial,"Wings is a great show. Although after the wedding, the burning down of both houses and the departure of Thomas Haden Church (Lowell), this show was headed toward its end. The stories in this season have a different feel to them, and they have almost abandoned the whole airport/airline aspect of the show.Still a great show and I will definitely be enjoying the last season upon its release."
3,Weakest season,"Wings is a show I really enjoy and always found funny. Despite the positive reviews I've seen on season 7, I found this to be the season I enjoyed the least. I certainly was not laughing out as loud as I was with the previous seasons, and not just because of the absence of Lowell. I'm keeping it in my library to complete the series, but when I go back to watch episodes of Wings I will more likely pick one of the other seasons."
4,Wings - Seventh Season,"Enjoy another season of Wings...while some of the comedy isn't as good as the previous seasons, the Seventh season is as good as any current TV sitcom."
4,"Great sound, playing and the pop songs aren't too bad either","Upon reading other reviews of this cd; I decided to specifically spend longer time sampling the second cd of this recording.2/3rds of the songs on the second cd are pop oriented, but well written and well played pop songs, much like Gentle Giant's ""Giant for a Day"".The first side is fantastic progressive rock,The sound of this live cd is of terrific quality.The band are enjoying themselves and it shows.A great recording - 6/10 compared to classic PFM, but 8/10 for everything else"
4,"From the bizarre to the mundane, Steed rides again.","Many years ago I read the works of J.P.Dunleavy and believed all of his characters to be fiction (excepting the Ginger Man of course). Patrick MacNee brings to life, a childhood filled with characters so outrageously bizarre that I must now reread Dunleavy. And that is the best compliment that I can give. As the remainder of his life is rather plodding, it pales in comparison to his early years. A little more detail on The Avengers would have been nice too. The language can at times be a little pretentious but then, so could MacNee."
4,Good value for basic flash cards,"This is an inexpensive set of flash cards (over 300) for Spanish. For beginners, it is a good value."
3,Good book but monotonous at times,"Very thorough and informative book. Too monotonous at times, which makes it a bit hard to read. Overall, a good reading for anyone involved or interested in BI, Data Warehousing and Data Mining."
3,Whispering Waters,"If you like waterfalls,streams,mountains and Yosimite National park this is the dvd for you.This dvd features waterfalls that start falling off the top of a mountain and your taking down the mountain with streams and other waterfalls.The video is crisp however there is a problem with this disc.It says on the back that you can choose between music and nature sounds or just the nature sounds.You only get music blended with nature sounds no nature sounds only version.They shouldn't put that on the back if it's not true.This was a major dissapointment for me thus the 3 stars as I have the natural sounds only version on vhs.Still this video is a must buy if love waterfalls.The music is newage piano.I also recommend the following titles that will will soon be available from the waves virtual vacations series.Best Caribbean BeachesBest Bahama BeachesBest Virgin Island BeachesCaribbean DaydreamsThese will just have nature sounds [online] for more details on the release date."
2,Poor cover of a great song,"This cover of Rammstein's international hit ""Du hast"" is poor at best. If you're a techno lover, and enjoyed the techno-flavored remixes of ""Ich Will"" and ""Links 234"", this may be for you. Otherwise, avoid it! There are no actual lyrics other than a distorted chant of ""du hast"". Which by the way is NOT Satanic, it means ""you have"", as in ""you have asked me"", nothing to do with hate.Anyway, It's a poor cover and I suggest you hunt down the actual ""Du hast"" single and check out the wicked remixes done by Clawfinger & Jacob Helner."
5,A novel based on the life of Henry James,"""Author, Author"", like Colm Toibin's ""The Master"", tells of a particular period of Henry James' life. David Lodge's novel takes place in the last twenty years of the 19th century when James' fortunes were at their lowest, culminating in his greatest failure, the opening and closing of his play ""Guy Domville"". At the centre of the novel is his friendship with the writer George Du Maurier. When James passes on using it for the basis of a novel, Du Maurier writes it instead and it becomes a bestseller. Du Maurier, however, has difficulty coping with success while James decides he must try harder to achieve it.David Lodge brings to life a great writer. The scenes and dialogues are witty, entertaining and informative and the book reads more like a novel than a biography. ""Author, Author"" is extremely well read by Christopher Kay for Clipper Audio."
2,that 70s show season 6,"when I recieved it , it had two of the same disc.What's up with that?It was a gift, so it was to late to send it back when I found out."
5,Great Shows,I LOVE That '70s Show. It would be a shame to miss any episode so i recomend buying all the seasons.
5,GREAT SHOW - GREAT SEASON - even Brooke Shields,"I love this show, I lived the seventies! What a cool time to grow up! In this set, I especially enjoyed seeing Brooke Shields play Mom to Jackie and girlfriend to Bob. The scene where Jackie and Donna discover Pam (B Shields) in a hot tub with Bob is too funny. Jackie and Donna joining forces to try to split their parents up is a hilarious change. Aaah - the Seventies!I noticed a review from a customer with skips, freezes, etc. If you have a problem with freezing, skipping, etc with a disc from a boxed set, try playing it in a friend's DVD player to be sure it isn't your player. Back in 2003 I returned two different boxed sets of ""Keeping up Appearances"" thinking both were defective. Skips and freezes showed up in same place on same disc with both BOXED sets. With the third set, I decided to try in a friend's DVD player. It played perfectly. The problem had been my player all along. My defective player was a RCA DRC220N - discarded since 2003."
3,"Great for information, but...","I found the information about the history of Tai Chi offered on this dvd to be very informative. However, I found the dvd cumbersome to navigate, getting to the actual long form part took forever. Also, as a learning tool I was quite disappointed. If you already know the long form and just want a dvd to practice with, this may be for you, but if you are trying to learn it, I suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Tai Chi,"I had a hard time following this DVD, it is not for beginners, and the layout is complicated. It is a great video in regards to the instructer, and contents, but I had no idea how to follow along."
3,88 Steps Form,"The presentation is not faultless, the picture quality is only slightly above home video. That said all the material is here, the long form, 88 steps broken down into indivdual moves, complete with breathing patterns.The base movements are also covered leaving a rounded package for all levels but also slight taste of disappointment that the DVD production could have been better."
4,"Taijiquan, Classical Yang Style DVD","Very good work. Serious, professional and compreensive.Many kinds of explainations and forms of presentation of the content. It's a very didactical approach.Very recomended for beginners."
3,"Good quality, but the moves are different","I own several Tai Chi DVD's, and have taken Tai Chi classes at a couple of different places; having said that, the moves in this video are different than I have seen anywhere else. Grasp the Sparrow's Tail, for example, looks very strange in this video. I understand that Dr. Yang is a Shaolin White Crane expert, so perhaps his Taijiquan is influenced by his martial arts background, anyway it is very different to me. However I will say that the quality of the DVD is very good. It is well laid out and the production quality is probably the best I have ever seen. If you are a student of Dr. Yang Jwing Ming this is probably an excellent video to own."
2,Brutal!,This was the worst Tai Chi dvd I have ever had the misfortune to experience. About the only thing this is good for is putting you to sleep!
2,How to avoid curling paper,"Here's what I learned when trying to install this film on a few olddoors and windows:Watch the Gila youtube video. If you don't want to buy the spray, just dowhat they say in the instructions (water + baby shampoo).Carefully remove all dirt, not just from the window itself but also around it.I have old doors and windows with paint that chips a little. Ended up havingto first repair and repaint the frames before applying the film. Just a fewflakes that settle on the adhesive side of the film near the edges will makeit impossible for the film to properly attach.This is made a bit harder also because of the curl in the product as itcomes of the roll.When removing the adhesive film, do not let the product touch itself.Where it does, the adhesive film is damaged.All in all, not as easy a product to work with in non-sterile situationsand when alone."
1,Crap,"Don't waste your money. I put this on a 2x2 foot window and it turned out ugly, cheap, and crappy looking. Even if this stuff were free I wouldn't use it. No matter what I did there were air bubbles and parts that just wouldn't remain stuck on the window. It ended up looking like I got drunk and decided to glue parchment paper to my window. Never buying from this company again."
1,Crap,I purchased the Gila Privacy Film for a bathroom window.My husband and I installed the film using the solution kit and a squeegee. I cleaned the window prior as well.I am COMPLETELY unsatisfied with the results. There are creases & air pockets. It looks like crap.DO NOT pay for this. I purchased it at Home Depot for $10 less. We are returning it as a defective product.Now off to find Goo-gone to get the sticky crap off my window.
2,bubbles and you need additional kit,The film bubbles and you have to purchase an additional kit to activate the adhesive. I thought it would be a window cling.
1,Lisa's review confirmed--products overpriced,"After reading the warning review by Lisa, I postponed my purchase of this product. I followed up with a trip to Lowe's where I purchased this exact product (Gila 3' x 6.5' rice paper) for $29.34 versus the current cost of $41.88 on amazon.com as of 09/27/09. The ""Gila Complete Application Kit"" cost $8.48 while selling on amazon.com for $17.88. Shipping costs would have been $7.81 and $7.37 respectively. The total purchase price at Lowe's was $40.77 versus the $67.57 at amazon.com, if we are to naively assume that only one instance of shipping charges would be incurred. This is rather disappointing whether amazon.com, Gila, or both are the culprits; not a wise paradigm for maintaining a loyal customer base. As for an actual review of the product, once I complete my project, I will append my review. The current rating of one star reflects the price gouging rather that a rating of the product itself."
4,Pretty good,"Like many other reviewers have said this isn't a cd for die hard country fans. I don't mind the current country and this cd I think is overall really good. My fave songs would have 2 be Without You, Cowboy Take Me Away. The Goodbye Earl song is offensive to some, but I think that they made a bold step to record it. It's very original in that sense. As for the rest of the cd it's oh k , Sin Wagon is too country for me.Let him fly is beautifully sung by Natalie=). I recommend this cd for anyone who likes to listen to upbeat fun music=)."
4,This CD is GOLD,"If you want to get a cd withclass,then you need this cd.I loved it. EARL is AWESOME.You will never regret thepurchase of this CD. BANK ON IT."
4,Dixie Chicks Fly is best,Dixie Chick's couldn't havedone any better. This DixieChick fan has to say it isone of the best. I do havea favorite and it will behere awhile. Goodbye Earl.
4,"That's right, I said ""mattress dancin'""!","Let it be known that I no longer hate country music. The last album I bought that could even be considered country was Pasty Cline, and that really doesn't count. My friend, who has similar taste in music(is everything EXCEPT country) went out & bought this when she was fed up with men, but don't let that fool you! Despite ""Goodbye Earl"", this is NOT a man-bashing album. And while we're on the subject, haven't we ALL had murderous fantasies at one point? Puh-LEEZE. Obviously, ""Sin Wagon"" is my favorite track (YEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWW), but their voices are so incredible that I enjoyed the ENTIRE CD. I didn't know that they had done ""Wide Open Spaces"", and will be checking that out very soon. These three are incredibly talented, and I wish them all the success in the world. They have definitely widened my musical horizons."
5,CHICKS ROCK!!!!,"Natalie and Emily came out recently expressing their love for heavy metal and arena rock...and its obvious on this new album. Some of these songs flat out rock!The best song is the hilarious (Alice Cooperesque) ""Good Bye Earl"". A hilarious dark song about getting revenge on a wife beater.""Hole In My Head"" rocks harder than the majority of the songs on those 80s Hair Metal albums. Great song!""Sin Wagon"" is a hard rocker with a hint of bluegrass. Kinda like a Hillbilly ""Highway To Hell""""If I Fall You're Going Down With Me""--another great song. Real uptempo. Reminds me of Vixen meets country.""Ready To Run"" the already hit single....more pop than rock. Great.""Some Days Ya Gotta Dance""--twang/rock. Gonna be a big hit for the ChicksThere are some ""country"" songs on the cd as well...like ""Cold Day In July"" (they did do a good job on it but Suzy Bogguss' version is better). The others...well just pick it up...this is the ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!"
5,Amazing.,"This is the first CD I bought of the dixie chicks, and nothing compares to this album. It's amazing and I love every song. My favorite song on this album is ""Fly"", the lyrics are wonderful. This CD is a great cd to sing to in the car."
4,Pleasantly Pleased....,"I don't listen to much country...but, I did enjoy listening to the 'Chicks', & I do recommend it....enjoy!!"
5,I can't believe it.,I can't believe some of the bad reviews this cd is getting. I guess that's why its #1 right now.
4,The Chicks Soar On 2nd LP,"Strangely enough, so many people say ""Well, I don't really like country music... but I like the Dixie Chicks."" Perhaps they don't realize that the Dixie Chicks have everyone fooled. The Chicks are playing the most rooted, traditional country music on the radio today. Yet they sell 8 million records, sell out arenas, and win Grammy awards like nobody's business. The Chicks are not just a girl group. They are THE girl group! They play their own instruments and write their own songs... you gotta love that! The Dixie Chicks deserve much more than platinum plaques and golden gramma-phones... they need a congressional medal of honor for bringing back the country into country music."
4,Excellent follow up to Wide Open Spaces,"I purchased the Wide Open Spaces album and absolutely loved it, so obviously I was greatly looking forward to any work the Chicks would do in the future.After getting my hands on ""Fly"" I was impressed. There are some great tracks on this album--many radio friendly hits. ""Ready to Run"", ""Goodbye Earl"", ""If I fall you're going down with me"", and ""Cowboy Take me Away"" are some of my favorites.The one downside to this album is that there aren't as many great songs as their previous album, but the overall quality of these songs are as good, or maybe even better. It's left up to the fan to decide, but this album is a definate for any country music fan--or even pop fan for that matter."
3,Good but First Better,"Outside of Ready to Fly and Cold Day in July, the album does not measure up to Wide Open Spaces. The depth of emotion felt on most of the first album's cuts (regardless of the song) just was not there on this album. Still, a good buy and I'm looking forward to their next release."
5,Hooks you from the first listen,"I never in a million years thought I would enjoy a CD from a trio of ""country chicks"", particularly with the banjo so prevalent. However, I just love this CD. It's fun, and you can tell they had fun on this one. Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for something unexpectantly good!"
3,Okay,"I'll be honest...this cd is not Excellent. ""Wide open Spaces"" was MUCH better. Don't get me wrong, ""Fly"" is decent but it doesn't compare with their 1st one. If you want the Chicks at their best, buy ""Wide Open Spaces"". ""Fly"" could be better."
1,They Missed With This Album,I was very dissapointed with this cd.Ready To Run is the only decent song.
1,Grab a dictionary,"Grab a dictionary and look up the word ""dross."" There you will find your review of this music. Is this what country music has come to?"
1,Terrible,I thought Wide Open Spaces was a so-so album but this album was just terrible. It took me 3 tries to sit down and listen to the whole thing and I doubt I will listen to it again.A real waste of 13 bucks if you ask me.
1,"One good song, that's all",Ready to Run is the only good song. The rest is disappointing. A waste of money.
2,"Okay, I don't get it","The sound quality is certainly far from state of the art, even by 80's standards. And the songs and performance - well, I don't get it. Give me the Trio of Emmylou, Dolly and Linda over these gals any day of the week. Lots of hype, good looks, but not much else."
2,Interesting,"I have never really been what you might call a ""fan"" of the Dixie Chicks, and I will not dispute their talent. However, this record seems to step beyond their bounds. It seems as if they are trying to walk away from the genre of music that has made them popular and explore the increrasingly popular workd of rustic and folk music. Never was this more clear than when I reached the end of the CD and heard the track, ""Let Him Fly,"" a cover of the song originally recorded by the wonderful Patty Griffin. Her voice never ceases to amaze me--she is definetely worth a look if you have the time. While the Chicks' performance on this album is stellar, I will stick with Patty and the other women who belong in this category."
4,More Than Just Country,"Let me put it this way: I hate country music. But weirdly enough, the Dixie Chicks' second CD, Fly, is one of my favorite CDs! Why?One word: variety.Fly has a strong country base, but added to the mix are Natalie Maines' awesome, bluesy vocals, accompanied by pop-like rhythms. The lyrics seem to be more girl-power than country. Also included are various non-country instruments (plus, the standard twangy guitar isn't always around - yay!). This makes up an eclectic, but delicious, mix you'll want to listen to again and again.Best Song: I liked ""Let Him Fly"" and ""Ready To Run,"" but a lot of people love ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" (personally, I hate it)Worst Song: ""If I Fall You're Going Down With Me""Bottom Line: Something for everyone."
2,Goodbye Dixie Chicks !,"I love the first CD but where did this stuff ""FLY"" in from? Too twangy for me folks. My advice - listen to it before your buy it. Goodbye Earl!"
2,Where's the trio?,"I saw the Dixie Chicks when they were beginning in Lubbock, TX. They were refreshing and dynamic. On this CD I hear only a lead singer ""pushing"" her voice beyond its capacity and do not hear the rest of the trio. For me ""Goodbye Earl"" is not entertaining, it contributes to a negative image of country music. If I had listened to a friend's copy of this CD, I would not have bought the CD."
1,THESE CHICKS NEED TO GET A CLUE,"My hopes for this album were sky-high when I bought it -- unfortunately, I am greatly disappointed. Several of the songs are very good, but a lot more are just boring. And like many other people, I found ""Goodbye Earl"" and ""Sin Wagon"" to be offensive and in very poor taste. I think I will just stick to ""Wide Open Spaces"" and hope the Dixie Chicks get a clue before they record their next album."
4,Glad to hear them get back to their roots,"I really like this album because it sounds more like the Chicks when I listened to them in churches and open air venues here in Dallas ""in the early years"". The only question I have is are the toenails pink in the picture? Insider joke from the second album. Go for it girls!!"
4,Chicks Fly Again,"Sophomore records tend to fade into oblivion, but the Chicks have overcome the jinks to put forth an ear-friendly album. The songwriting is strong. The album is worth it if you only listen to ""Cold Day in July"". Although not a Wide Open Spaces, you will find yourself listening to this album for a long time."
3,"Goodbye, Earl","""Goodbye Earl"" has got to be the worst song on this album. If not for that and the sound of Natalie's voice, I'd give the album 5 stars."
2,Better Luck Next Time...,"I really like ""Wide Open Spaces"" so I borrowed this cd from my sister and listened to it a couple times. So let me tell you-- don't waste your money! I tried to give it a fair chance, but alas, you can't like a cd that has only 3 good songs out of 13. Most of the songs are just plain boring and they just don't stand out. There are a couple songs that would give country a bad name ""Goodbye Earl"" and ""Sin Wagon"", moms don't let your 7 year olds listen to these songs! And someone was VERY right! The lead singer Natalie Maines sounds like she strained a few vocal chords doing this album. I was thoroughy unimpressed!"
1,TASTELESS IS RIGHT,"The reviewers that have called ""Goodbye Earl"" and ""Sin Wagon"" tasteless are absolutely right. What on earth were the Chicks thinking? Musically, three or four songs are good, but otherwise, the music on this CD is subpar. Put it all together, and the bottom line is that this CD is just plain bad."
2,BARF!,"I don't know if there's a good song on it...Every song is so different from their first one...The first one had such good morals! And, no, I'm not one of those old people reviewing in...I'm 12...And my sister has this CD, and I borrowed it...Trust me, I'll never do it again...I'd advise people that actually like MUSIC, don't get the Dixie Chicks."
2,Thumbs down,"This album contains a few good tracks, like Ready to Run, but all in all it was a big disappointment. Wide Open Spaces was a much better album."
4,Flying High,"The Dixie Chicks' ""Fly"" is an awesome CD. Natalie Maines is the star attraction of this band, with her awesome, rich vocals. Sisters Emily Robison and Martie Seidel play banjo and fiddle, respectively, and together, these three Chicks make beautiful music.The songs on ""Fly"" run the gamut from funny (""Hole in My Head,"" ""Good-bye Earl,"" the oh-so-controversial single about a woman who offs her abusive husband) to heart-wrenching (the beautiful, subtle ""Let Him Fly,"" ""Cold Day in July"") to sweet (""Cowboy Take Me Away""). As I've said, Maines has a powerful voice, and she utilizes it to its fullest. The vocals flow out of your stereo and into your ears, and you can't help but sing along."
3,Haven't listened the whole way through,"I bought this CD a week after it was released(when I heard a radio show play ""Goodbye Earl"" months before it became a hit). I haven't listened to the whole CD yet, but I like the songs that I have heard so far, including ""Goodbye Earl""(The video, with Dennis Franz as Earl, is FUNNY! )."
2,A major disappointment!,"I am a fan of the Dixie Chicks and I absoultely loved Wide Open Spaces, but this album is a true disappointment. I still had Wide Open Spaces in my car CD player until I purchsed Fly, and guess what???? I have now put Fly in its little plastic case with all my other CD's (stored away) and have put Wide Open Spaces back in my car. I was expecting so much more form this album and I am very disappointed! These songs are not catchy, not entertaining, and some are actually a bit offensive to me."
2,Hoping for a little more...,"After Wide Open Spaces, I expected a little more. I love the Dixie Chicks but what were they thinking! The singing isn't the problem...the music and lyrics are. I don't understand why people don't stick to what made them."
2,What a let down,"I never really paid much attention to the Dixie Chicks music until I heard ""Ready to Run."" I really loved this song and bought the Runaway Bride soundtrack because I liked the song so much. I decided to buy their Wide Open Spaces CD and I really liked it, so I was excited when I heard they were coming out with a new CD. Well I purchased the new CD and WOW, was I disappointed. Another listener wrote in and said that if you like ""Ready to Run"" save your money and just purchase the single. I have to agree with that listener, ""Ready to Run"" is the only good song on the whole CD."
2,Not up to snuff,"I have enjoyed the ""radio"" play of the Dixie Chicks...but their albulms leave something to be desired. Their latest effort is no exception. Sure there a few good songs...but for the most part...you will only like this albulm if you are just getting out of a relationship...its depressing. Its a shame to see such musical talent wasted on mediocre songs."
2,Better luck next time....,"This album was nothing like the first. The first was far better. I think Natalie (the lead singer) should step down and let Marty or Emily sing, she would be better off for it. In this CD she sounds like she is trying to prove something, by screaming and hitting high notes and hanging on to those hard to reach notes. I found only 3 or 4 songs that I could bear to listen to. Natalie needs to give the other two a chance. My suggestion would be to NOT buy this one. It wasn't worth the money."
5,Buy this one ASAP,WOW! I am more than amazed. The chicks have truly outdone themselves on their phenomenal sophomore album. This trio is pure country and pure fun!
5,Just as good as the first one,"I really liked (loved) Wide open spaces. And this CD is just as good. The Dixie Chicks have such an original sound, and unlike Shania Twain (who I like also) they opted not to do cross over country, just country-country. This CD rocks!"
3,"My name is Karen Carter, This new album is amazing!","Their first album, wide open spaces was amazing, positive, uplifting & easy to sing along with. Now that they have a new one out I had to have it! Howevwer, it isn't quite as good as the first one, but whose is? I reccommend it! Especially Hello, Mr.Heartache. You can't help but sing along! This album is a must have. Karen :-)"
4,"Almost as good as ""Wide Open Spaces""","I loved WOP and I got this the day it was released, but I knew I couldn't expect it to be as good as WOP. I was truly surprised. This is great album. Lots of great songs. 1,2,3,5 and others. I highly recommend it."
3,"The Dixie Chicks explore some ""Wide Open Spaces""","""Fly"" is certainly different from the hit ""Wide Open Spaces"" album. I haven't decided yet if this is a good or bad thing. I liked almost all of the songs after my first listen. I'm even hooked on ""Goodbye Earl,"" a song that I know will generate a great deal of controversy in the coming months. The real disappointment on this album is ""Sin Wagon."" It is very upbeat and has a great deal of potential. The one thing that turns me off is the way that a widely recognized hymn is twisted to fit the rebellion of the song. I've been a huge fan of the Dixie Chicks since the day I say the ""I Can Love You Better"" video for the first time. I'm still a big fan of the quality of the music and instruments included on this album, but for the moment, my opinion of the group is a bit lower."
2,I don't get it?,The recording quality is horrible. The songs remain the same. The first CD was far superior. A complete waste of money and time. They're better than this.
4,great album,I was never into country but after listening to the first three songs on this cd over an over again (my carpool loved them) I was hooked. This cd has caused me to look more into country. Even my friends who don't listen to country that much bought it too. It has many great songs and I recommend it to anyone. There are a few songs that I don't like but the majority of the cd is wonderful. Some may think that Dixie chicks may not know how to dress (I like their clothes) but they sure can sing and play awesome music.
5,Title should be: Best of Dixie Chicks!!!!,"I am not really a country fan, but this Dixie Chicks album makes me want to become one. Their sophmore effort shows how all of the Chicks have grown musically. Each song takes on a personality of it's own and will keep you listening for more. Their harmonies are just beautifully structured and well blended. They could not have made a better album!"
5,The best song has to be Goodbye Earl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is great. I especially love the Goodbye Earl. This is a great turning point for country music. I think more artists should open up and sing stuff about redemption and revenge. This was so cool. Don't get me wrong, I love the mushy stuff too, but Earl is totally perfect. I love the Dixie Chicks and wish I had gotten to see them while they were playing here in Dallas on the streets before they were big. I can't wait for them to come to town. I am definately going to their next concert here. Let's go out to the lake (Earl)!!!!!"
3,Don't expect WIDE OPEN SPACES,"What a letdown this disc is after the electrifying debut of Wide Open Spaces. The songs slum when they should soar. I don't blame the Chicks, but this stronger material is perhaps beyond their reach. Maybe someone with a country/rock hybrid background could do this material justice. Someone such as Neil Young or Stephen Stills, or even CSNY could take this material and make it soar. The album is good, but no classic."
3,"""Fly's"" Lyrics Disappoint","The Dixie Chicks are a talented group but I feel that ""Fly"" is not nearly as good as ""Wide Open Spaces."" Of course, ""Wide Open Spaces"" was an awesome product and a hard act to follow. My 3 star rating basically reflects my dislike for the lyrics on ""Earl"" and ""Sin Wagon."" I had to ask myself why am I listening to this kind of stuff. Other than these two songs, I feel the album is OK but not a classic like ""Wide Open Spaces."""
3,A Mixed Bag,"I heard the entire album in a friend's car and was surprised at how different it sounds from the two singles that are always on the radio and TV. The Dixie Chicks' vocalist has a powerful voice, but it seems kind of antiquated. Most modern country is hard to tell from popular music, but her twangy style made me think of old bluegrass songs and hillbilly music. Perhaps they could market ""Dixie Chicks"" moonshine:) However, some of the songs were really good with neat violins and the like and in those songs the vocalist's style was a nice complement to the music. I also think that it should be noted that the Dixie Chicks are important because they get a lot of TV time, even in this beauty-obesessed time, despite the fact that the vocalist is overweight and has weird teeth. That's good for a change."
5,"Way to go, Chicks!","This is a great follow-up to ""Wide Open Spaces,"" but in a lot of ways better. ""Fly"" lets the trio expand their range of talents and lets Natalie rock. It's the mid-tempo songs, ""Cowboy Take Me Away,""""Cold Day in July,""and ""Without You"" showcase what the girls can do, with the rest just underlining their diverse talents.On the subject of ""Goodbye, Earl,"" they couldn't have picked better stars for the video than Jane Krakowski of ""Ally McBeal"" and Dennis Franz; those two are great! I don't think Dixie Chicks are condoning anything by the song. It isn't going to ""make"" anyone do anything unless they want to, and if they do, there's a criminal justice system in place to decide whether the ""victim"" was the abuser or the abused. There are more elements at work in those situations than this song; people need to lighten up and enjoy what's there without taking it literally!"
1,Less than stellar follow-up!,"The Chicks are still looking good and the stories on the songs are interesting, but the music left me wanting. Wide Open Spaces was a knockout (like the chicks!) but this new effort makes me think that perhaps the gals need to be less headstrong and more open to advice on their next CD. Will probably still buy the next CD when it comes out but will be hoping for somthing better. In the meantime, the Chicks hit the top of the chart this week so maybe it is just me!!"
5,I don't like country...,"...but I love this CD. Sure, it's still country... but it rocks as well. I'm a new and entrenched fan. Love ""Earl."""
4,"Tad Bit Disappointing, But Good","it was a little dissapointing after all the hipe and their first album (loved it), but overall it was very good. i LOVED goodbye earl. i don't usually enjoy country music (only mainstream stuff like dixie chicks and faith hill) but i love this. really a fun album."
1,I HATE THIS CD!,"WIDE OPEN SPACES WAS TERRIFIC, BUT THIS CD IS GROSSLY OVER-RATED. IT IS A WASTE OF DEAD PRESIDENTS!"
1,They are just not that good.,"Maybe it is because I am not a huge country fan. This music has crossed over to hit radio and I just don't hear it. It isn't GREAT country music. It is so-so country music. There are better artists and better albums. This is country-music lite, for people who can't handle the taste of the real thing and want something bland..."
1,I'll start over.,"Since A m a z o n saw fit to delete my earlier r e v i e w because it was too truthful, I'll keep this one short and sweet.Better girl groups below.1. TLC2. EnVogue3.

4,"Fun, Sing your Heart out CD!!","The whole REASON I bought the CD was ""Goodbye Earl"" What a catchy little upbeat number about murder!!! The whole CD is full of music you can crank up on the car stereo, and sing your heart out to. Natalie's voice is clear and so strong... they are great fun to listen to... and sing along with."
5,Fly is incredibly better than the first CD,"This CD is awesome! I never thought they would be able to top their first release, but somehow they have. The songs are a variety and each is interesting and moving. I love it and listen to it two or three times a day!!! GO get a copy for yourself!"
5,Chicks are hot!,"As a big fan of the Dixie Chicks - after seeing them perform on the Country Music Awards last year - I have counted Wide Open Spaces as one of my favorite CD's. I purchased Fly the day it was released, and have listened to nothing else since! ""Hole in my Head"" is fun to crank up on the stereo, and ""Cowboy Take me Away"" makes me want to live on a farm in the middle of no where!"
5,My favorite CD is this one!,"I was given ""FLY"" ofr Christmas and have been listening to it ever since. ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" is a great hit, it will be listned to for years. You have to listen to all the songs to really discover this CD. They are all great and deserve all the prasie their getting."
5,Chick Power,"First of all, I am a diehard DixieChick fan. Maybe I am a bit partial, but I really enjoy my new Fly CD. My favorite song is Goodbye Earl. It's the best. I know it's a little morbid, but it's still a great song."
4,This cd is a big hit,"This cd is country, which normally, i dont get into country music at all. But this cd has some sort of a pop beat mixed in it. My favorite song is ""Cowboy take me away"" It is a very romantic song that you could just get lost in. It leaves you daydreaming over that perfect charming guy that you wish would come take you away...... This cd is one of my all time favorites."
3,FLY,I must say that I am a big Dixie Chicks fan and I'm a bit disappointed with this CD. Its just not their kinda music. I definately think that Wide Open Spaces was the best!
3,Fly by the Dixie Chicks,"Ready to Run is the best song on this CD (in my opinion). I found this CD to be moderately entertaining, though I was somewhat disappointed. I especially didn't like the song Goodbye Earl. These women do have wonderful voices & I'm sure they'll be around for a long time to come. I do like how they have a mix of country, rock 'n roll..."
2,"FLY, BACK TO WIDE OPEN SPACES!","This album really sounds as if it was thrown together.I have listened to it 2 times since i bought it the week it came out (a month and a half ago)it has 2 good songs 1 ok and the rest would be ok if your drunk and not paying much attention to them.I dont see how or why it's selling so good ,guess ever one has been tricked like me!The first album is great this one is wasted money.I say wait for the third album, I'm waiting for it now!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I LOVE the Chickies. They are amazingly talented and, I think, will have a huge future. However, this album just didn't live up to WOS. Maybe that wasn't possible. But, I feel there were some odd choices of songs that weakened the overall package. I so wanted them to have another blockbuster. I really don't like ""Earl"" and a couple songs were just too twangy. But the chicks rock and I want them around for a long time."
2,The Dixie Chicks and FLY,"The Dixie Chicks are certainly talented, but their new CD, FLY, does not reflect it. Yeah, sure there are a few catchy tunes like COWBOY TAKE ME AWAY and SIN WAGON, but for the most part it sounds like songs put together at the last minute to fulfill a contract. Granted they did have to put together a new CD to, in a limited amount of time.I, personally, loved their first album, WIDE OPEN SPACES. I expected FLY to be more like it, but I was disappointed."
5,Amazing! just Amazing!,"After the success of Wide Open Spaces, I was very concerned that the Dixie Chicks would crossover into the pop-country mix that many sophomore stars do. After finally relenting and listening to the album I can now say that Fly is better than their first album. This album has a wonderful mixture of heartfelt ballads, and songs that feel good to sing with just because you feel good. I strongly recommend this albumm to anyone remotely interested in it."
5,I love the Guitars and the Violins in the Cd,"The firt song I heard was ""Cowboy take me away"", and the thing that I really loved muchly of that song waS the Violin its a very nice song. I don't know nothing about the Dixie Chicks, but I like very much the songs."
4,Worth at Least a Listen,"Although not a country fan, this CD captured my attention. Why? Because it featured songs that I have heard time and time again over the past year. From ""Ready to Run"" first heard on the movie, RUNAWAY BRIDE, to ""Goodbye Earl"" seen on a music video, I had to have the CD to find out why the Dixie Chicks are so hot in country music right now. I discovered one other song that really piqued my interest on FLY--""Cowboy Take Me Away."" These three songs were the only ones on the CD that I cared for. However, the Dixie Chicks manage to keep an upbeat attitude with a definite eye toward success. I would recommend this CD if you're a country fan. If not, unless you're curious, stay away."
2,A BIG disappointment!,"If you loved The Wide Open Spaces cd(as I did), you're NOT going to enjoy this one. Perhaps for 2 cuts(#1 and 12), their music is nothing like the sound that made almost all their songs go high up on the charts from the first album; I'm not sure if I'll even be tempted to listen to this cd again."
2,2 hits and many misses,"I bought the Dixie Chick cd mainly because of the songs Ready to Run and Cowboy Take me Away. I had hoped that the rest of the cd would be as good as those two cuts. I was vastly dissapointed with the rest of this cd. I also think the song, Goodbye Earl is in poor taste. The Dixie Chicks don't advocate murder as a option in getting even but they make it sound like its enjoyable. When I get sick of the two songs I really like, it will be time for resale. Buy the cd singles is my advice."
4,The next country crossover . . .,"I've never been a country fan, but after picking up Wide Open Spaces I had to get Fly. The highlights off the album are Cowboy Take Me Away (Beautiful!!), the Celtic flavored Ready To Run and Goodbye Earl, the controversial single with the hilarious video. The whole album is great and appeals to both country and non country fans. Interestingly enough, there is no track 13, skipping from 12 to 14."
5,Chicks Rule,"Discovered the girls when I went through ... best of 2000. Love the fiddle, the voices and the banjo. I am not a big fan of country but these girls have truly opened my eyes. When I first listened to the album, Natalie's voice stood out the most, but as you listen again and again it's the instruments that make you sit in awe. I play the violin so I just love the fiddle being played in souch a soulful and skillful way. Cold Day in July was my original favourite but now it is Cowboy Take Me Away, If I fall, Heartbreak Town, and Hello Mr Heartache. There are no words that express how much I love the music by these girls. I prefer it to the younger Wide Open Spaces - it is more mature and more polished and I think it demonstrates the extent of the skill these women have - I am now a Chick convert, where are the concert tickets?"
4,"More raw and from the heart than ""Wide Open Spaces""","I couldn't believe there could be an album better than ""Wide Open Spaces"", but the Dixie Chicks proved me wrong. With more heart-quenching songs this album really taps into all your emotions. It's easily the Dixie Chicks most beautiful release yet."
5,Excellent,"This CD is just great! Great to listen to in the car, at home, at work...wherever you are. And it's not just for Country Folk...it would appeal to anyone who has any taste in music."
5,Chicks Rock!,"I HIGHLY recommend this cd. It has a song for every mood your in. Lots of cd's only have one or two songs you like, but every song on this cd is great. I think my favorite song is Cowboy Take Me Away or Sin Wagon. Even if you are not a big country fan, this is a great cd. It would be a great gift!"
4,"""Fly"" with the Dixie Chicks","I am the Dixie Chicks' new ""Biggest Fan."" I finally bought this CD after listening to their songs and loving them. And I can honestly say that the only time I've stopped playing it was when my husband told me that our neighbors might kill us if I played it one more time. The best tracks are ""If I Fall..."" ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" ""Cold Day in July"" ""Without YOu"" and ""Heartbreak Town"". The album rocks, a perfect blend of Natalie Maines' strong soulful voice, Emily Robison and Martie Seidel providing great harmony and fiery musical solos, and heartfelt -- and often funny -- lyrics. There are a couple songs that I don't love, but that's all right, too. You can't please everyone all the time. I was reluctant to buy this CD because I wouldn't typically describe myself as a ""country fan."" But the Chicks make Country a style and not a category. They're fantastic!"
3,"Great, but no ""Wide Open Spaces""","This cd is good, but Wide Open Spaces was better. I think Wide Open Spaces was more simple than this one. The first single, Ready To Run, is a little annoying, the second, Cowboy Take Me Away, was good, but no ""You Were Mine'; then the following singles were good: ""Goodbye Earl"", ""Cold Day In July"" and 'Without You'. But there are songs in this album that are strange, like ""Hole In my Head' and ""Let Him Fly"". The rest of the album is just good songs from the chicks. Overall, great."
2,"Half Housefly, Half Pest","The record is only half as good as the last one. The singing and playing excels, but the material falls short. The ""Earl"" track is downright offensive and the country equivalent of Eminem; it trivializes spousal abuse. If the tables were turned, and it was three men conspiring to murder an abusive wife, there'd be a huge, and appropriate, public outcry. These women have a lot to learn."
2,Not Too Good,"I didn't like this album. ""Cold Day in July"" was a beautiful, smooth and fairly tight ballad when done by Suzy Bogguss, now it's grating and messy. If you want soulful, sincere Country without too much twang, Suzy Bogguss, Nanci Griffith and Mary Chapin Carpenter are the way to go."
1,Not anywhere near their potential.,"I just listened to the new CD. It won't even make it to my truck's CD case. I'll just listen to their Wide Open Spaces CD and see if anything they write next hits the radio. I don't think any of the FLY CD songs are good enough for the radio. Also they are really bent on telling everyone they can do whatever they want to: Sure, that's true, but they won't have any fans promoting an attitude like the comments on the insert in the CD. I predict the Dixie Chicks are going to fade away very soon. Sorry for the bad news."
1,I was not impressed with their singing.,"I can't stand the Dixie Chicks.All their songs sound alike to me, with only the words being different. I appreciate you all giving people like me a chance to review their C D . You certainly saved me some money, because i work a lot and dont get a chance to keep up with the latest recordings, so sometimes i will buy music without having heard it just because it is popular and everyone is raving about it. So thanks again for allowing me to review the C D. before buying it."
2,Fell short of my expectations,"I liked the Dixie Chick's video ""Ready to Run"" the title cut on this album, and given its sales success, thought I'd give ""Fly"" a try. Unfortunately, this one is going straight to the garage sale. There are two good cuts -- ""Run"" and ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" -- which, coincidently, are the Chicks' two most recent videos. The rest of the album is whine-y. It isn't that the Chicks aren't capable of nice harmonizing, it's that the material on ""Fly"" doesn't show that off. A more capable producer, and maybe less rush to put out an album, might have avoided that. The Chicks sound great on ""Rolly Poly"" on ""Ride with Bob,"" the new CD by ""Asleep at the Wheel"" so they can hit the mark with ease. Hopefully, they will next time."
3,Eh...it's alright,"There are some good songs on here, but this album pales in comparison to ""Wide Open Spaces"". I can play that album all the way through without skipping songs, but on ""Fly"", some of the songs are just not that good. That's not to say there aren't any hits on here either, which I'm sure you all will hear on the radio sooner or later."
5,Dixie Chicks Rock!,"Sophomore albums usually come with a little letdown, because in most cases the first album is so good it can't be duplicated. Duplication definitely isn't the case with FLY and FLY is the best album to debut this year. The Dixie Chicks brought life back into country music with their wild ways and they work so well together. One quote from their tour manager sums it up. ""They are SUCH girls. They are their audience. They like to shop, do makeup together...it's like a f---in' slumber party on the bus. I'll go on and they've got their pajamas and their blankets and some girlie movie going--it's the cutest thing."" About ""Goodbye Earl""...that is such a funny song. And the instrumentation in ""Sin Wagon"" is amazing. :) Emily rocks with that banjo. Go get FLY, I promise you won't be disappointed."
1,Zulu Dawn,"Not anyones fault, unless better labeling would have helped, but we cannot view the movie since it came from Belgium and need a TV set in another zone."
2,Poor Video Quality / Low Level Acting,"The video quality is lousy. They did a very poor job transferring from film to DVD with this one. As far as the presented storyline goes, it is just so-so. What I found to be lacking is decent acting by anybody, even the ""name brand"" actors. Terrible performances ! This movie could have been as good as ""Zulu"" was as the story is based on actual events that occured just prior to the battle in ""Zulu"". Bad photography, bad directing, bad acting. Bored during the entire presentation."
4,Two Parts,"This makes a nice companion piece to the movie Zulu. Released after Zulu, this movie is never the less a prequel. Both movies are stand alone, so it is not imperative to see one or the other before viewing either. A first rate cast and African scenery makes this a winner. Though there seems to be a bit of an anti-British undercurrent, the movie has only a few historical inaccuracies. The British did make a mistake, and sadly for the men involved, it resulted in the greatest defeat of a modern army by a tribal force. Incredible battle scenes make this a must."
5,The Thin Red Line is Bent,"This is a more than a fair representation of the British colonial presumptions and arrogance existing during the reign of Queen Vistoria and before. England's ignorance of the Zulu potential to wage effective war against a modern army of that time is most evident and their blunders, both on a diplomatic and military basis are compelling to watch. It is a superlative film in everyway. The cast is at it's very best and the photography is stunning. This film and Zulu ( 1964) should be in every film and history buffs collection. It is a crying shame that this is not readily available or released in DVD."
3,Review of DVD transfer,"The new Tango release of the Zulu Dawn DVD is not as bad as some folks make out. On ebay, a while back, someone was selling the region 1 version of the film based on the English DVD which had been out for a while. It was somewhat letter-boxed but the image was fuzzy and the colors bled a lot (but it was better than the VHS version). The new Tango seems to have the same screen ratio with some letter-boxing top and bottom. I didn't see any evidence of pan and scan and it seemed somewhat wide-screen though I imagine the original print was wider. The transfer is better than the ebay/English version with more definition and less color bleed. It's not as good as a pristine new DVD release or, for that matter, the MGM DVD release of Zulu with is a truly excellent transfer. Perhaps an original 35 print of the film doesn't exist anymore which would be a shame. It's too bad that both of these films weren't made more in the digital era. Both of them need more Zulus in the frames!"
4,Forgotten Facts,"I have read some very good books, with pictures, about this incident and the defense of Rourke's Drift. An unknown fact about the battle is the ""Lack of Ammunition supplied to the soldiers"" and the way they were all facing the wrong direction when attacked from all sides and over the mountains.After this battle and the one at Rourke's Drift the British sent a proper army into the area and challenged the Zulu's to come out and fight. The British formed the famous ""Square"" and fought a defensive battle and when the Zulu's gave up, after being badly shot up, the British cavalry chased them down and cut them to ribbons.The British got their revenge and whatever else they wanted. An excellent army used for political and economic gain!But in general I always enjoy a historical movie."
2,problem,i could not play this dvd in the US because of some region problem. had to play it on my laptop and the sound quality was TERRIBLE
2,Does this really compare to the 1980s masterpiece?,"I was a young boy when the 1980's version appeared on national television to the likes of million of viewers. Back then the only voice of reason I had to base any realism off of was my late father James! He too was a big fan of Henry Cele, the actor who played the on screen role of Chaka king of the Zulus! That movie had so much starpower and drama. I have not watched this movie, but I will let the public know what I really thing of this version.Professor Ed DavisPulaski Technical CollegeN. little Rock, ARk"
4,"Great movie, pathetic DVD transfer","Arguably one the best war films of all time. However, it's DVD transfer was terrible, like they just copied a VHS tape. Nevertheless, it is a great movie, with great acting, and the British getting stomped by an African tribe that remained unconquered!"
3,Zulu - The prequel,"This movie is a very good prequel to the movie, Zulu. You will understand how the arrogance of a British general, and British disregard for the Zulu warriors, lead to a disaster larger than Custer's defeat at Little Big Horn. It is even more remarkable how a handful of Welshmen could withstand the same overwhelming force of Zulu's at Rork's Drift in the movie Zulu. Both movies were filmed in Africa so you will see the spectacular scenery. The acting is good in both movies. Burt Lancaster stands out as usual giving a great performance."
3,Zulu Dawn: OK but not as good as Zulu,This is a movie worth watching with some fair battle scenes in. Political correctness seems to have a strangle grip on the writing of this movie.
2,Enjoyable film marred by a poor transfer,"I'll leave it to others to comment on the film itself, but I do want to warn potential purchasers that the DVD transfer leaves a lot to be desired. The original film is 2.35:1; the DVD is 16:9 letter boxed (not anamorphic)so about a third of the film is missing and it is clearly obvious in quite a few scenes. The quality of the transfer itself, while not awful, is not particularly good either."
2,"Great Movie, Train Wreck DVD","This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I've been waiting ever since the invention of DVD for it to appear. The VHS version I had was by some two-bit Canadian company and it hissed so badly you could barely understand the dialogue. When I saw that the DVD was going to be released I jumped with joy and I had to keep myself from running to the mailbox (like the dork that I am)when it arrived.So you can imagine my disappointment at the lack of a widescreen version the p*ss-poor extras and worse, the godawful sound and atrocious coloring. What was once an epic looks like something you'd find on late nite TV on a channel with poor reception. I know this movie was made in '79 but does it have to look like an old 8mm porno thats been wasting away in a steamer trunk for two decades?"
1,DVD was for the wrong region,"The DVD sent to me was not for the United States. It was for region 2, so it would not play on any DVD player bought in the USA. I live in the USA. The billing address and address it was being sent to are in the USA. Very disappointing, since no where in the purchase was the region requested or noted. I threw the DVD away."
4,realistic history,"the movie captures the defeat of the British forces by the Zulu in an understandable and captivating narrative. I would have liked more focus on the causes of the battle, how each character contributed to the battle, and the battle itself, but the movie was extremely interesting."
1,Zulu Dawn,It was the wrong region format & had to be returned. Correct format waswas not available for replacement of DVD.
3,Thrilling Finale Saves Film From Zulu Yawn,"My interest in this film stems from my enjoyment of the original ""Zulu"". I would recommend this film to the fans of ""Zulu"" but do not have high expectations. To the filmmakers credit they try to meticulously portray the events that led to the massacre of British troops at the hands of Zulu warriors. It's not the filmmakers ambition that I'm criticizing but in the way they execute their story. The events preceding the battle border on the stuporous. The film feels like it's populated by re-enactors as opposed to actors playing real men. This is odd because of the presence of fine actors like Burt Lancaster and Peter O'Toole in the cast. Before all is lost, however, the makers deliver a slam-bang extended battle scene in the film's final third to redeem this enterprise. In closing, anyone venturing into this film has to slog through some inert patches but are semi-rewarded by sticking it out to the end."
1,Crap.,"It's hard to believe that so much time, money, people, and so-called talent canactually make something this bad. It appears to have been ""directed"" by a committee.It's boring, slow-paced, and topped off with absurd dialogs. O'Toole lookspermanently drugged out of his gourd and Lancaster is affecting an accent fromwhat exactly? The unqualified best performances were given by the horses. Watchingthis movie is less exciting than watching paint dry."
2,Mud,"Slow,dull and done on the ""cheap""....stick with ""Zulu"" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining."
4,Video Now Car Adapter,"If you own a Video Now personal video player, you know how fast it can go through batteries. The upside of this toy being battery operated is the ability to change batteries while traveling such as mid-flight to grandma's house, or at the restaraunt or dentists office without having to recharge like those DVD players. While this is more convenient in the some situations; maybe not so much in the car. To make this toy an absolutely wonderful travel companion, you need the Car Adapter. Saves on batteries and won't leave your child stranded in the middle of an episode while driving down the road. An absolute must if you own a Video Now or Video Now Junior player."
3,"Good music, annoying interludes","I love Superchick but I forgot they cater to young teens. Part of a track is a talking portion aimed to make kids feel like they aren't alone in what they are going through, and, of course, the song Hero is on this disk so it fits. The CD is made to empower youth... I just skip to the next song and rock out anyway. Also, the last track has about 5 mins of dead air before a very short clip of what must have been a funny day in the recording studio. Not a fan of that when I'm driving."
4,Crusoe review,"An interesting albeit disjointed movie at times. Plenty of potential for a follow on series. Friday needs more exposure, plays a good part. Does Robinson meet up with his family?"
4,Great show,"Loved this show when it was airing, so I had to buy the only season. Great action-adventure series with lots of intrigue, pirates, and a swiss-family-Robinson-esque treehouse. Lots of fun and good family entertainment. Definitely something my family would have loved when I was a kid. Follow Crusoe as he searches his memories to discover what the events that brought him to that deserted island really mean. He and Friday try to survive visits from welcome and unwelcome guests, all the while hoping to make it off the island and back to England to Crusoe's wife and kids. Great series with amazing actors!"
1,Crusoe,"The Virginian was beautiful but I can not say the same about CrusoeThis was a cheap DVD and the quality certainly matched the priceThe picture quality was very good BUT audio was shocking...a complete waste of moneyI could only hear half of the audio and that was way out of sync with the lips...bloody shockingIs there anything I can do apart from just dropping it in the rubbish binOn a brighter note, Virginian was the same as Season 1 bought from you earlier...excellentThis was disappointing but will not stop me from any further purchasesRegardsGeoff Klingbiel23 Manning AvenueCoffs Harbour 2450New South Wales Au"
3,Boring and confusing,"I did not like this adaptation of the book to a TV serie. It is necessary to have read the book before so as to understand the movie. I also made a great mistake, I did not check if it was adequate for children and I bought it for my daughter who had just read the book. If the movie is confusing for an adult, you can have an idea how it is for a child. Well, I do not recommend it."
5,Watch This Show!,"I just stumbled upon this show when it was on TV and was lucky enough to see it from the very first episode all the way through (thanks to Tivo -- it wasn't easy to find it otherwise with all of the scheduling changes it went through). I am so happy to see that it is being released on DVD! It will be fun to watch it again. If you haven't seen this show, or if you missed some of the episodes, I highly recommend it. It's a lot of fun and a great family show too. I hope the DVD set includes some extras not seen on TV. It would be great if they made some kind of movie to tie up everything not resolved in the series. Or, continuing the series to another season would be even better!"
5,Please ..We Need An End To This Show,"This was a wonderful TV series and it's a shame we couldn't get another season out of NBC. After watching all 13 hrs. of this...you come away with...""to be continued"" feeling.I still gave it 5 stars because it was so entertaining . A series ending movie at the very least...please."
3,Get off the Island,"It was a good T.V. show with good fight scenes, I just wish they could have fast forward to when Robinson and Friday got off the island. I suppose they were hoping to do that in season 2."
5,Crusoe was a great show that ended too soon!,"Crusoe, the TV retelling of the adventures of Robinson Crusoe is swashbuckling fun for the whole family. It is not gory, twisted or filled with sex. Instead you get the straight forward story of Crusoe, who misses his family and stays faithful to his wife even though he has not seen her in six years. The show takes liberties with the classic novel, however they are usually not harmful to the overall story. Philip Winchester is excellent as Crusoe and Tongal Arnold Chirisa is fabulous as Friday. They complement each other well. Also appearing in the series to excellent effect are Sean Bean and Sam Neil. The show had only twelve episodes, however they are certainly worth the cost of the DVDs if you enjoy action, intrigue and adventure. I recommend you buy it now and see if you agree."
5,Why do all the good ones get cancelled???,They cancel a show because it has bad ratings but they put it on the least watched night on television!! So what do they expect? I am so sick of these executives cancelling good shows without truly giving them a chance.
4,"Very well done, grateful for this dvd release!","I loved this show! I wasn't sure how they could pull it off with just two people, or if it would sink into a Gilligan's Island scenario with people splashing onto the island and then leaving without them. It actually far surpassed my expectations. There are complete episodes with just the two main characters and there are episodes with the outsiders and natives that find their way to the area of Crusoe's island. Glad to report it never feels forced. The action is exciting and tense, the relationships are very sensitive, and the cinematography is amazing! I didn't give 5 stars only because any time there was a flashback scene away from the island I found myself a little confused with all the backstory. Although the final episodes do a great job of bringing the characters back home into the story, fully realized.I am very sad this is all we are going to get from this. But for me,the final episode has a satisfying ending anyways."
4,I DON'T WANT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL...,"...to a woman who demands RESPECT, but this recording is worth the money if only to hear the daughter of a preacherman sing--and very well--""Ain't Necessarily So""! A diamond!"
4,Pretty and sexy cammie,"This is a very pretty camisole which fits perfectly on the body and is excellent for when you don't want a plunging neckline, but something pretty at the chest. The nude color is very flattering and the cammie is of good quality."
2,Poor quality- flawed design,"I bought three Nelson sprayers with Easy-Click action-> one like this and two with 6 spray styles. While it is 'easy' and clicks just like a pen with a retractable point, the rubber over the trigger quickly loosened and pulled off of the sprayer after a few minutes of use. Another of the three I bought is showing signs of falling off as well.Good stuff: Soft feel, fits nicely in hand, easy clickBad Stuff: Soft plastic smells of toxic plastic additives, soft trigger housing may pull away during casual use."
2,Don't bother,"My 4-year-old is just getting his hands on the Playstation, and seemed to like the game at first, but now he always complains that it takes so long between screens. After 5-10 minutes he asks to play his Blue's Clues game on the computer."
1,To dull for a 3 year old?,"Do not waste money on this game. My three year old loves the show, so we got the game hoping to give him something educational and at a 3 year level. Oops! Not 5 minutes later, he was done and begging for anything else."
1,Blue's Clue's Big Musical Adventure Game 4 Playstation,"This game was very disappointing. My daughter can play other Playstation games just fine, but this one was just awful. It is constantly loading, something even I didn't have the patience for, let alone a 4 year old. The instructions in the manual are very basic, but when actually playing the game you can't go on just those few tips. It is hard to navigate your way around the playing screen, you seem to go in circles and never really make progress. It was terrible, and my child was very frustrated and disappointed. It isn't hard because of difficulty level. It's hard because you can't seem to figure out how to play it correctly and it takes SOOO much time between EVERY screen. Save your money! The Blue's Clues CD-ROM games for PC are much better. They are easy to understand, stay true to the show, and teach much."
2,Blues Clues Loading Musical,"The premise of the game is cute; however, my 3 year-old quickly got bored. It loads each and every time you walk out of a room! For a toddler who is moving the control back and forth, this happened far too frequently. Since the idea of the game is to go to different locations looking for clues, it loaded at least once a minute. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!"
1,Robin Dorris,WASTE OF MONEY. Game is always loading. Very boring for my 4-year old as well as myself.
3,We love Blue but not this game!,This game is very frustrating because it is always loading. I think they could have done a much better job developing it. But my son still plays it because he loves Blue and Steve so much!
2,Clues Blues,"When I first saw this game in the store, I thought it would be a great game for the PS2 we just bought for the kids this summer. When my 2 year got bored with Blue and gave the controller to his baby sister, I knew something was wrong. My 5 yr old, you is new to video games, is mastering this and just plays the song and the Skiddoos. Maybe Mattel will make it more interesting next time and send me a copy for testing this one."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased this product when it fist came out.... I have been very disappointed with it. My 3yr. old was bored with it (he is doing great with the computer software). The screens take way too long to load. It couldn't even hold my interest. The graphics are very poor. It is just collecting dust behind the other Playstation games. I hope they come out with a much improved version and give those of us who wasted money on it a big discount.
4,This Is A GREAT GAME!!,"My 3 year old daughter love's Blue's Clues and when I purchase this game for her she just loved it. This game is very easy for young childern to play this game which is based on the popular kids tv series ""Blue's Clues"". I highly recommened this game!"
2,it only makes me laugh ..,"though it's a nice thought, none of these bands (or anyone, for that matter) should have ever been allowed to touch oingo boingo."
1,Get your own music!,This Cd sucks. If you are going to re-do songs..please PLEASE leave Boingo out of it! These songs are fine how they are..we dont need some silly wanna be bands re-doing them! I mean come on..give us Boingo fan's a break!
2,I AGREE WITH MAX R. TURNER,"This is a very lacking, dry and humdrum album for an effort in the name and spirit of METAL. Their previous albums had punch and bite but the fire on this album seemed to have fizzled.Do not pay alot of money for this because it is very disappointing compared to their previous efforts and to other great true METAL albums that were released by MANILLA ROAD, PAGAN ALTER, WOLF, SABBAT, TWISTED TOWER DIRE, etc."
1,The Worst SEVEN WITCHES Effort...,"I have all of SEVEN WITCHES' CDs (except for this one) and I must tell you I wonder what Jack Frost was thinking? 'Amped' has no flow, the vocals are crap and the overall sound of the material is BORING. I traded this CD in for something better. They did so much better with their latest effort as well as their earlier releases. Steer clear from this if you are just beginning to listen to SEVEN WITCHES. Make this your last purchase..."
1,AMPED????? MORE LIKE FIRED,"FAN OF SEVEN WITCHES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GROUP AND ALSO A FAN OF JACK FROST, THIS CD HAS KNOW EMOTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE A NEW SINGER WHO CANT SING AND THE SONGS ARE VERY SIMPLE WITH NO EMOTION OR FEELINGITSLIKE JACK FROST GOT STUCK ON A BLACK LABEL SOCIETY KICK"
1,BEWARE OF MODEL,"All I can say is be very careful with this dealer. They shipped a different glove than is in the picture. They actually ship the newer model of the Ektelon O3 Glove. Very disappointed in the seller. They can certainly expect a phone call from me and I will send this back.The glove that you do get isn't all that bad though, dont get me wrong-- Its just not the one advertised and for that I will give this 1/5."
4,"No sweaty hands, but not good grip.","This glove is very good in quality. It is holding up very well to sweat and ""abuse."" The only problem I have is it doesn't have the grip of my old glove, which causes the racquet to slip in my hand sometimes. Good for the ""reach"" shot but not good when I'm really trying to smash it. On the plus side, my hand doesn't sweat like crazy. What a plus that is!"
1,Bad Experience!!,Ordered a watch from this seller. Never got it nor did I ever get any response from the seller to my emails. Beware of buying anything from this seller! You just may not get it!
3,JollyMon,If you are a fan of JIMMY & THE PARROTS this is a 'best buy'. Compilation is a good mix -- buy it & sit back and enjoy with a 'boat drink' & a cheeseburger.
5,Secret weapon!,"Wow, this training is great for getting you to feel like a whip and to emit much more power during your form or pushing hands. Also, if you don't train Tai Chi for martial arts, it's really great because your body gets so connected you feel and look like you're underwater when you practice, very flowing and natural. Total body workout, deep into the muscles, tendons and bones."
2,"Another ""Metal DVD"" put out for quick cash","This DVD is billed as a behind the scene and live performance compilation. Well, it should not be surpising that all this DVD contains is big names on the cover. The bands ""are"": Kiss, Ozzy Osbourne, Yes, Scorpions, Lita Ford, Bon Jovi, Skid Row, Poison, Megadeth, Extreme, Winger, Nelson, White Lion, Trixter, King's X, Ugly Kid Joe, Anthrax, and Slaughter.Now after reading the list to see Megadeth, Trixter and Poison in the same line and you are continuing to read this review, just be forewarned that this is ONE DVD that it claims to have all those bands and you ""...See Them on stage, behind the scenes and in candid interviews.""The cheesy description should tell you what you're buying, ""Through the decades rockers have come and gone, but these are the legends - The Bigest, the baddest, the best - the ROCK SURVIVORS!"""
3,OKEY!,"As soon as I got this game I loved it! It was so much fun! But then once you finish the game and wanna play it again, its so lame and easy! It was fun at first you can beat it in at least 30 min.! Rent it! Save your money!"
3,How much?????,There is no listed price. Why would I purchase it if I don't know how much it is???????
1,Don't waste your money!,"First off, this is an expensive hand tool (approx $15 plus shipping). Good garden hand tools CAN be pricey, but usually when they are, they're really good quality tools. This one is not. The handle (which happens to be hollow, by the way) actually came apart while I was using it. The blade is ""wimpy"" (not stiff enough), and it was uncomfortable to use. I actually returned mine (due to the handle coming apart), and the seller graciously refunded my money, including shipping. There are many tools out there that are similar to this one that are made much better. Avoid this one."
5,an intriguing look at an important but ignored subject,"This is a fascinating insight into our most basic, but most overlooked sense. Lots of basic factual information, which is clearly written and easy to understand, and lots of interesting and thought provoking material about how important our noses are in our daily lives. Quick reading - will liven up your next conversation."
1,Gives off nasty smell when lit,The bulb works well except for the horrible toxic smell it gives off when lit. Probably from the orange coating.
4,axe shredder becoming great songwriter,"I was pleasantly surprised by this cd. I have his previous (flume ride) which has good moments, but generally I lumped him in with all the other Satriani/Malmsteen wannabes. Well, from the first track here, he definitely proved me wrong! Some really nice writing, great pop metal tunes(I know, sounds like a weird combination, but for me it works). Polychords abound and rhythm changes but the stuff is accessible, smart, catchy. Plays well too. I wish he would put away his Holdsworth recordings but he blend some nice jazz stuff into the mix. As a player he is still developing, I know his best stuff is yet to come. If you enjoy Greg Howe, Richie Kotzen and Vinnie Moore, this guy writes better tunes than all of them put together! He can stand toe to toe with them as a player also. I recommend this disc to lovers of melodic instrumental rock/jazz fusion."
3,Good endnotes and bibliography,"Noll's work may be flawed by his skewed perspective -- the disturbingly penetrating eyes of Jung on the cover are mirrored strikingly by Noll's intense eyes on the inside back flap! However, his endnotes and bibliography are excellent; I spent many hours in the Library of Congress checking up on his sources. Jung was evidently a man of great personal power and erudition, as is (evidently) Noll. Is this a case of the son killing the father, as Noll claims was the relation between Jung and Freud? (see Noll's comments on the Mithraic image of sacrificing the bull, Freud being a Taurus who would have picked up on a potentially patricidal image from Jung coded in this arcane manner!)"
1,Information Misused,"Richard Noll, a clinical psychologist, has shown that his title is no guarantee for the quality of his work.His book is full of interesting information on C. G. Jung and at the same time of his own inability to use this information.To give some examples, a psychologist should know:- what a pagan is, that it is related to a limited Christian understanding of the world, not necessarily that of Jung's- that Jung's 'belief' was not necessarily in the historic Jesus that Noll himself seems to believe in- that new ideas do not come about without a vision; not even to Jung- that our unconsciousness is what governs our life, if we like it or notThe book does raise a question:What has Jung done to Richard Noll to get this kind of aggressive treatment?This question could also be put in the following way:What is happening in Richard Noll's unconsciousness to create this aggression?"
4,An entertaining debunk,"I really enjoyed this book. Great fun! While it seems quite in keeping with what I know about Jung it's hard to judge when there don't appear to be other books on Jung that aren't written by cult members. I've read about a dozen books debunking Freud and showing what an arrogant, megalomaniac, immoral, unscientific charlatan he was. It makes sense that Jung had similar traits.The picture that emerges of Freud is mostly consistent and well established. However I can't locate any objective books on Jung. To my mind reading a biography or psychological analysis on someone like Freud or Jung that is written by one of their followers is a tedious waste of time."
5,"Great book --""Jung cult"" comments notwithstanding","This is a great read and an excellent unveiling of the messianic, occultist, anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi, Rockefeller intimate who plundered the demonic to create a psychology of dubious value. Many of the comments attest to the fact that the Jung cult is alive and well."
1,This is not Jung,"For scholarship that debunks this book's irresponsible sensationalism, see Stevens' new edition of ""On Jung"", alsoShamdasani's ""Cult Fictions"", and especially the article about Noll's tainted Jungian background in ""Gnosis Magazine (No.46., Winter 1998). More than anything else, if you're going to read this book, you owe it to yourself to read at least a little of the Portable Jung first.The sad thing is that Noll may be many readers' first exposure to Jung's biography. With Noll's Harvard credentials and the accolades of reviewers who have never read Jung for themselves, ""Aryan Christ"" will be a hard first impression to shake. Its portrayal of Jung as charismatic cult leader is unsupportable at best, if not downright dishonest."
1,how projections and hurt feelings write a book,"an atrocious bunch of lies, innuendoes and half-truths rush toprint aided by the New York Times book review, noted Jung-hater. One of the most irresponsible books to hit the presses in recent years, itmasquerades as science in areas that most would not be able tochallenge. And like the DaVinci Code (that at least has the grace to call itself fiction), Noll calls into question sacred cows. Noll obviously has a vendetta and is out to discredit and smear Jung. Reader beware! BS camouflaged as ""scientific research""."
1,Trashy Style Meets Academe,"If you like articles in the National Enquirer, you will love this book. Salacious, vicious, and generally unsupported by evidence, I thought I was reading one of those attacks on President Clinton, paid for by his enemies. No understanding of Jung's philosophy or methods but filled with imagined descriptions of unproven lovemaking that seemed to have more relation to the author's own character than to anything Dr. Jung might have conceived. Trashiest style I've ever encountered in an academic book or indeed in any legitimate publication for the general public. Waste neither your time nor your money on this [book]."
1,disapointing,"That is what you feel while reading this political article.If you expect to learn something from this book about C.G.Jung,forget about it. Mr. Jung was a great man and a famous scientist, who enreached the Western civilization. But reading this so-called book you only will learn that Dr. Jung was charlatan, mystic, adulterer, anti-semite,fascist and so on.Most of the book, for some mysterious reason, known perhaps to Mr. Noll himself,devoted to american patients of Dr.Jung. Very few lines to Dr. Jung Himself. Very dissapoingting. If your are a serious reader and interested in the history of psychiatry,I would not recommend this book for reading.Waiste of time and money."
1,Projection is no substitute for scholarship,"I began reading Noll's book with great anticipation, that I would be given objective information heretofore not covered about CG Jung.I quickly began to get the uncomfortable feeling that Noll was consciously attempting to defame Jung.I have no interest in such a show of a lack of integrity.I suspect the author has some significantly dark secrets of his own that he is unconsciously projecting upon Jung in this book.Perhaps one day he will face up to them and then write a book about Jung."
5,Welcome to Pop Heaven!,"42 cuts of pure pop dynamite! An incredible feast of the most delectable pop gems in the music industry. All sadly overlooked by the masses but loved by every power popster out there. If you're testing the jangly, hook-laden pop music waters for the first time - START HERE! A MASTERPIECE!"
1,Marriage Buster,"This book, like many others like it, Unfortunately are filled with garbage that only allows unfaithful thoughts, actions and lies to creep into your marriage. The spouse reaching for these types of books, Needs to re-evaluate their own input into their marriage and ask themselves if they would enjoy it if their partner were secretly making such purchases. If they would take the proper steps in bringing the romance back into their marriage the right way, the more intimate rewards would surely follow! This book is Not worth the marriages it destroyes."
1,"if i could rate this 0 stars,i would","This cd completly sucks.This guy's talent shows why he wont tell his name.I feel tainted cuz i touched this.Whoever this guy is,he killed classic 50 songs.Along with others.Hes even killed eminem songs.And soon,hes gonna kill some outkast songs.Avoid ""tribute"" albums at all cost."
1,What the f**k!!!,"A blatant attempt at capitalizing on an overhyped thug.....if you talk about tributes to hip-hoppers....look to Afrika Bambatta, Grandmaster Flash, Kooh Herc, hell even Tribe called Quest....50-Cent tribute...Bullshi....."
1,copy,This album is song by someone other then 50 cent.Theses songs are his but the person rapping is not this CD is a rip off.
1,A TRIBUTE FOR WHAT REASON?,What has this loser done to deserve a tribute album.Hes been rapping for only about two years and already a tribute album.I guess anybody can get a tribute album now a days.The songs sound even worse than the originals.DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!
1,Dumb. What a waste of time,Why is this idiot riding on 50's ass man? This is disgusting and a prime example of how some people have no tALENT AND FRANKLY NO BRAINS. What the hell is this and why was this ever released? Anyone who saw this album being promoted should have just throwed it back in the face of this moron. That includes all the record stores too. I can't wait for 50 cent to be removed(freely or forcefully)from the music scene. Damn Amazon should do themselves a favor and remove this from their website. It's a total disgrace.
1,Very Disappointed,I thought this book would have the actual story of Erotokritos in poetic form. This book only discusses the poem it does not contain it.
5,Ashley Parker Angel: His True Life,"A lot of us watched him perform and grow up in the pop group O-Town. Back in those days he was irresistable with his adoring looks. Since then, he's had to go through a transformation. He's had to grow up fast,and he's had to go from fame to a normal guy with the responcibilites of an adult. He's been there for his girlfriend, and he's worked tremendously hard to get where he is. This album shows all the hard work and dedication that he has put through, and it also shows his growth and talented ways- his singing and writing talents. This album truely deserves the respect and listening skills. its a beautiful and emotional album. its really good and perfect for him."
5,Love It!!,I bought it the day it came out and couldn't stop listening to it. Just love it. Ashley has an awesome voice. I see him going far.
5,Absolutely Incredible!,"Every single song on this album demonstrates how talented Ashley Parker Angel is. The hit song ""Let U Go"" is just an awesome song that is fun to rock out to. The Beatles-esque ""Who Cares"" has incredible lyrics as do the gorgeous ""Apology"", the haunting ""Shades of Blue"", ""Along the Way"" and ""Who Cares?"". ""So Alive"" and ""Sountrack to your Life"" are fun, heartfelt, and inspiring. Again, each track (co-written by Ashley Parker Angel)is absolutely amazing and truly demonstrates his talent as a musician and songwriter. The entire album has amazing production (by the Matrix and Soulpower Productions). If you do not own this album you are certainly missing out on amazing music!"
5,Back on Tracks,"What a great album;every song has a different vibe.I'm so glad Ashley got the chance to show off his songwriting skills.With most CD's I'm lucky if I like 1/2 but these are all good.If you only buy 1 CD this should be it. My top 3 faves are ""Apology"",""Where Did You Go?"" and ""Shades of Blue""."
5,"Soundtrack of your life a ""must"" have","What can I say about Ashley Parker Angel's Debut album other then run out or click to buy this album. It totally is worth you money. I love every track on this album. Ashley really did a great job with this one. From track one to twelve its non-stop rock. Even the slow tracks are cool. One perticular track has a ""Beatles"" feel to it. I won't say which one. Anyway, buy the album it'll be worth it."

5,This CD rocks!!!,"""Soundtrack to Your Life"" is such a great CD. the songs are fun, catchy, easy-to-relate to, and all-around great. Ashley has an awesome voice, which makes the CD even better than it already is! I think everyone can relate to his music. Some of my absolutely favorites are ""Soundtrack To Your Life"", ""Crazy Beautiful"", and ""Who Cares?"". I love this CD!!! I recommend everyone buy this album!!! You wont regret it!"
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!,"Ashley's talent is shining through - this CD is great! The best CD is one where ALL the songs are good, and this is one of those. It will for sure be at the top of my list of favorites."
5,Amazing!!,"I absolutely love it! I have been anxiously awaiting the release after watching the show. The songs are amazing and the whole album is terrific. He has definately moved on from the ""boy-band"" and graduated to true musician. I would recommend this to anyone!!!"
5,Preschool kids will love this!,My preschool classes love to hear the Veggie Tales songs! They are upbeat and alot of fun to sing and dance to.
4,Good time saver,"I found this book the best of the three I bought from Amazon. It saved me time on the first upgrade I was doing on my 91 LX, which paid for the book right then and there. It gives some helpful details like which size wrench you'll need at each step."
2,THIS BOOK IS A VERY GENERAL START FOR YOUR PROJECTS,"THE BOOK WAS PRETTY GOOD HOWEVER, I FEEL IT LACKED A LOT MORE INFORMATION FOR THE PROJECTS IT DISCUSSED. FOR EXAMPLE IT TALKED ABOUT THROTLE BODY REPLACEMENT BUT DID NOT MENTION HOW A 70MM T.B.WOULD BE BETTER THAN A 65MM T.B. OTHER THAN IT'S SIZE OBVIOUSLY. WHAT ABOUT GAS MILAGE WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT? WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR EVERYDAY DRIVING? THE BOOK NEVER MENTIONED ANY OF THAT. ANOTHER PROJECT WAS AIR CLEANERS IT DID NOT DISCUSS THE DIFFERENT TYPES THAT ARE OFFERED AND WHAT THE ADVANTAGES ARE COMPARED TO THE OTHER. ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR HOP UPS ARE COMPUTER CHIPS, THE BOOK DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. OH, BUT IT TALKED ABOUT NITROUS AND BLOWERS THOUGH?????? I PERSONALLY DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK. IT LACKED LOTS OF INFORMATION THAT YOU WOULD NEED IN ORDER FOR YOU TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU WOULD WANT TO TAKE ON A PROJECT TO BEGIN WITH."
5,the mighty frog eyes,"hop aboard the frog eyes bandwagon before they become the indie sensation they deserve to be. when bands like arcade fire and wolf parade (a band featuring former/sometimes frog eyes keyboardist spencer krug) are getting a lot of mainstream press, frog eyes remain comfortably under the radar. they make more exciting music, artsy and original without sacrificing important elements like accessibility (catchiness). could you ask for more? frog eyes are also the best live touring act around today.a band in the same caliber as neutral milk hotel, they already made their own In the Aeroplane Over the Sea (2003's flawless The Golden River) and follow it up with the almost as good The Folded Palm. you need both!"
4,Great for the Right Mattress,"This little clock is great, if you have the right mattress. I got it about a month ago, and since then was lucky enough to get a new mattress. My old one was thinner and your basic 'came with the bed set' stuff, and the little sonic boom got me up in a jiffy. My new mattress is very thick, and the boom only causes a gentle buzz that's pretty easy to ignore.So, it does it's job if you have the right bed for it. Also, the light of the clock face is bright; if you're a light sleeper you won't enjoy it. I ended up draping a thin scarf over it to dull it a bit.With all that said it's still a reliable clock that's very cute and unique."
5,Fantastic,"I bought this alarm clock for my daughter, who has never been able to wake up to an alarm. I don't know if it's the bed shaker or the sound, but she wakes up to it every morning. What a life saver!"
5,Perfect for the hard of hearing or hearing impaired.,"I am hard of hearing and needed an alarm that would work for me. Not only is this the cutest alarm, it has been a Godsend. The pink color is very cool (my daughter wants one now lol) and the rainbow display is whimsical. The actual vibrating pad is very strong and there is no way you can not wake up, hearing impaired or not! You can choose to have the vibration alone, buzz alone or both together. It also has a high and low dimmer for the display. The cord for the vibrating pad is long enough to reach to the farthest side of the bed on a king sized bed. I love this item and highly recommend it. This is the best price anywhere that I have found including eBay."
5,Sonic Boom Alarm Clock Really Works for Sound Sleepers,"This Sonic Boom Sweetheart alarm clock is great! I usually sleep soundly and have a problem hearing the alarm. I have been searching for years for one that I can depend on to wake me up everyday. This is it! If the very very loud alarm doesn't wake you, the vibrator will...just put it under your mattress pad and it will wake you every time. The brightness of the numbers, the type of sound the alarm makes and the volume of the alarm can all be adjusted. Also, you can choose between alarm only, vibrator only or alarm/vibrator combination...it's up to you. And, of course, there's a snooze button that's easy to access."
5,best alarm i have ever bought,i am a heavy sleeper and work 2 jobs so every alarm clock i had bought i couldnt hear ...they either chirped or the alarm was very soft and i couldnt hear them to wake for work. so i was always trying not to sleep to heavily when i did get to sleep which eventually started making me pretty miserable from lack of sleep .....until i found this alarm clock the sonic boom now i can fall asleep and this clock wakes me right up its loud and the vibrating helps alot as well. very good product!!!!! very good investment!!!!!
3,Cute but no display during a power outtage even with the battery back up,The clock is very cute for my college daughter. The only problem with the clock is that it has a battery back up in the event of power failure but it does not show the time on the display. What is the point of having a battery back up if the display does not appear. Who cares if it still maintains accurate time. She will need to see what time it is if there is a power outage. This clock was bought for that purpose along with the alarm attachment.If my daughter did not love the look of the clock I would be sending it back. Way too much money to not have a display with the battery back up.
1,Got a Lemon )= Please Read!,I bought this months ago based on the previous reviewers. I buy early this was a gift for my daughters high school graduation! I thought this would be a great college gift!Well months later she opens it takes to her room to try it and.....The time speeds up during the night!!!! So if you set it for 8:00 am it goes of at 6:00 or 5:00 am etc...So I got a lemon.... I threw 37.00 in the trash!.....
5,There is no sleeping through this one,"My daughter is the world's heaviest sleeper (age 7) and this is the first alarm we found that not even she can sleep through. Engages three senses to generate the wake-up: vestibular/motion (via the vibrating pod you put under the pillow or mattress); sight (flashing lights); hearing (variable loud-mama blaring alarm). You can adjust the volume and the tone of the alarm, so if you have thinnish walls, you should still be able to use this. Great for special needs/autism spectrum, ADHD. Wish I'd known about this before I wasted gobs of money trying so many other alarms."
2,My daughter hates it,I thought the idea was fabulous so I got it for my daughter for Christmas. She is 15 and has hated it since the moment she opened the gift. She refuses to use it and thinks it is extremely ugly.Update-My hearing impaired sister has the clock now and she uses the vibrating extension under her pillow and it actually wakes her up every morning without waking up the rest of the household.
4,Reliable,"I'm currently a 19 year old hard-of-hearing girl, who is also a deep sleeper, and I've had this alarm clock for probably 9-10 years, if not more. No, not the same company.. the same EXACT alarm clock. It's loud enough for me, and the bed shaker is VERY effective. Maybe it's just me, but after a while, I got used to the sound and didn't really hear it anymore when waking up. Now, 10 years later, I'm finally shopping for a new vibrating alarm because now, the time will speed up .. so I'll set the time correctly at night, and then when I wake up, the clock will say it's about 4 hours later than it really is.I'm definitely considering getting another of the same product, just because this one has lasted me so long."
3,kind of works,"Short and sweet; this product's shake feature is quite strong and will startle you awake. Minus 2 stars for the product missing one LED segment upon arrival (cent tell if it is 5/6 and 8/9 oclock). for the price i paid, I'd at least expect to be able to tell the time, which this clock can only do for 20 hours of the day. This is a timed bed shaker now more than an alarm clock since I'd have to confirm the time on my cell phone."
1,Clock Stopped Working,"My daughter gave me this product for Christmas two years ago. It was nice to have and worked for about a year. I probably used it less than ten times. The clock stopped working, I replaced the batteries and it still didn't work. I forgot about it and recently tried it again, forgetting that I had already replaced the batteries I again bought new batteries and tried it again - same thing. I emailed customer service twice and never heard from them. I finally found a phone number for them and called. I was informed that the model has been discounted and the clock cannot be replaced, therefore the whole thing doesn't work. So I can't do anything with it except throw it away. I will probably not buy this brand again."
1,Boycott Kultur,"This DVD does NOT include the finale of Schoenberg's Gurrelieder, with Klaus Maria Brandauer, contrary to Amazon's description. The total running time is 95 minutes, rather than the 113 minutes in the Amazon description. The credits at the end of the DVD include Klaus Maria Brandauer, but he is nowhere on this DVD.Amazon UK lists this DVD with the same contents,including the Gurrelieder finale, but on the Arthaus label. I'll now try getting it from the UK. Obviously Kultur has the US rights to this program but chose not to include the Gurrelieder finale, which was the only reason I purchased it. Kultur has specialized for years in inferior picture and sound quality, and now they are deleting music as well.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KULTUR!!"
5,Full of factual information.,while this book is full of valuable information. It is not dull or boring. It takes the fear out of receiving a Photo Radar TicketYou no longer have to white knuckle a summons that is delivered by mail. Read this clear and helpful book and relax as Ms Kayler sets you straight with the truth about Photo Radar.
2,Here's an example of a good thing done poorly...,"Don't be mislead, this is signed by the editor and staff, not Mr. King. In addition, it is a low quality publication with very poor print quality. Don't get me wrong, if you're a fan of Stephen King, especially works like ""Danse Macabre"", then this is probably a must have. It also makes a good conversation piece or book club discussion material. But if you're a fan of his stories and are looking for something to read and enjoy, then you would fare better with one of his short story collections."
2,Can't you hear me,"I like the idea of putting all this blue grass together, in a sense it is a nice history of the music. But the recording quality is very poor."
2,Sony at it again,"I'm sure Sony purposely finished the title with ""80 Years of American Music"". Major Bluegrass players were left out, and those living that were included are there for an obvious reason; Sony gets another cut for being their label. Example? Dixie Chicks. The song is lesser known, and made by the newer ""pop"" version of the Chicks, not the group that won Best Band at The Telluride Bluegrass Festival. There is some great music on this set, but who wants a gulp of Sony's vinegar girl Natalie along with the downhome goodness represented by the real bluegrass cuts. Another attempt by a big label to define a genre based on their own artists. I'm only surprised they didn't stick a Dionne Warwick tune on this set."
3,Just say NO to the Dixie Chicks,"Even though this set has 100+ songs by the greatest artist in Bluegrass, I will not be purchasing it because it has one track by the Dixie Chicks. I urge all Americans to boycott them in any of their albums, concerts, or anything else."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Large astronomical objects blow up everything, even trolls.So what is a young moomin to do when threatened with extinction by big space rock smooshing? Set out to save the world of course, preferably with a bunch of friends. If you make some new ones on the way, then that is perfectly fine as well. How exactly a short funny looking little guy can have his own astronomical impact requires a bit of invention."
1,Beautifull but uncomfortable,"The design is very versatile, nevertheless is very uncomfortable in the front straps because is narrow. My feet is regular (a little bit narrow) and this sandal ""killed me"".I dont recommend them."
3,great cleanser.. not good for what I bought it for.,I bought this to go along with the clarisonic because the lady at the spa told me it would work great with it.... It dosent its gel like texture makes the clarisonic tug on your skin. Also on its own without the clarisonic if you have any trace of makeup it wont take it off it isnt deep cleaning. you need to use it with a wash cloth which it does recommend on the directions. on a positive note it does not dry your skin out at all leaves it very moisturized with no film whatever.
2,What the Stone Crop Gel Wash Won't Do,"1. It won't foam up into a gorgeous lather, especially if a Clarisonic is involved. With your hands, you'll get something close to white streaks of soapyness.2. It won't lift eye makeup, though if you try (and try again), it won't sting.3. It won't overly dry out your skin like say, Kate Sommerville. But it's not necessarily gentle on skin that's felt the side effects of Differin, Tazorac, etc. The only cleanser I've found that works for that is Nude Skincare Cleansing Wash.4. It won't leave an imprint of fragrance after washing (a plus in my book).5. It won't feel like money well spent. Sad face.Note: The Stone Crop Serum was more worthwhile since I did notice a smoother skin tone."
3,"Ok face wash, a bit drying","I do like all of the eminence products I have tried, but this one is just ok. I use this in the evening and I find that my skin feels a little dry afterwards. I do love the smell. I have not noticed any difference in my skin after using this. But it gets my skin clean. I don't think I would buy this again."
4,Traditional West African drums 'uncorrupted' by electrics,"Decades of playing and teaching have helped 'Dibo' and Miguel find the creme de la creme of students: the proof is in the listening, as good or better a group as we have ever heard.An extra delight is the sense of swing found in some tunes which begs the question ""is swing actually of African origin?""Fore-Fote is only a four-member group, but you'll swear there just has to be more of them."
3,QUICK FUN READ,"This book seemed like a passing note to me. There wasn't much of a story, just a glimpse into the life of a confused kid in the 90's. I enjoyed the prose for the most part. Once in a while it became a little overwhelming. The run on sentences added a cool effect but not when one sentence took up an entire page. Kudos to Bryan for shedding a light on alternative prose."
4,Coming of Age Story,"This is the story of Vim Sweeney, coming of age in the early 1990s. Vim is caught between his band, his disappointment in his father, and his attraction to his bandmate's girlfriend. The writing style is chaotic, but it suits the theme. Vim must overcome his confusion as he tries to decide what he's going to do with his life. I'd love to know what happens next! Overall this was a good story; occasionally a bit wandering in style but a good story nonetheless."
2,Pretentious Waste of Time,"Pretentious stream-of-conscious [...]. You know those song lyrics that are just detached words and concepts, with only the paragraph they're in in common? This is 211 pages of that. An example: ""I'm digging the view and yet not. Helene is somewhere out there in it. Queen Helene, I'll sing when I see her. Sing her to sleep whisper into the flesh of her cheek whe she wakes up crying her tears taste like words."" Somehow this type of writing has built up popularity over the years and is heralded as abstract genius. This is the literary equivalent of the ""modern"" art people say their 5 year olds could do."
1,This book sucked.,"Bryan Charles is obsessed with showing you how cool he is. But when you read his strange, jarring prose you don't marvel at BC's creativity; you just think he's spewing nonsense. I'm usually a fast reader, but Grab Onto Me Tightly took me almost a week because I kept getting stuck on lines like""You want to rip out her scars and eat them like Twizzlers""""Heart as collapsed time, a dug-up grave, a simple machine""""this almost-city recedes in flame and the sun's ghost becomes our breath""If your desire to sound clever makes your book totally unreadable, you're probably doing something wrong.I had another gripe with the book: I had no idea why the protagonist did most of the things he did. However, he was appealing, as were the refreshingly nonstereotypical supporting characters. I'm sure the book would have been totally decent if not for the writing. As is it is, though, it's only useful as an example of what not to do.PS-BC doesn't know how to spell ""Gretsch"""
1,looks better online,seems as if a better quality could have been insisted upon for the materials used to construct this shoe. they look kinda cheap/cheesy in person.
2,Title is Misleading-Did not find this book helpful!,"I got this book as a gift (prematurely in my opinion!), and did not learn anything new about holistic practices or natural remedies.The ""success"" stories were more like horror stories and made me more nervous than hopeful.I am going to stick with good diet & exercise, drinking lots of water, eliminating alcohol and caffeine, enjoying lots of sex, and maybe some acupuncture.I would say that this book is not even worth buying it used for $1.UPDATE: We were successful after taking bee products (propolis with royal jelly) and cell salts for one month. Worth a try!"
